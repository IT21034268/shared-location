3,"The beginnings of Batman, though you'd never know it...","Fairly good, but dated, mystery novel by Rinehart was actually the basis for the later old dark house mystery stage play, THE BAT, which she penned with Avery Hopwood. There is no Bat charcater in THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE, but Roland West's first filmed version of the play (the silent one) depicted the Bat character in a bat-man type outfit that inspired Bob Kane to create his Batman for Detective Comics."
2,Mystery,"I didn't finish this book as the Circular Staircase characters are unbelievable. I have trouble reading a book where the older character, the Aunt, is written as having learned nothing in all her many years. She is so gullible she believes every word of her Niece & Nephew & takes the servants words at face value. I found all the characters boring. The book is confusing in that one minute the house they are at is isolated the next everyone has run off to town just blocks from the house!"
3,A Circular View,"The Circular Staircase is a proper name for this storybecause it does go in circles. The reader must stick to it for awhile.But, it does get there. And when it does it will hold your interestif you are an old fashioned mystery buff. The main character is an olderlady who simply will not be bullied. She has rented a strange oldmansion with secrets. The lady along with her family have decided tostay in the house regardless of strange happenings. There is a side story also involving a large bank fraud incident. Stick with it.The service I received from the seller was very good. I would buy fromthem again."
4,cat5e cable,Perfect. It runs under the house from one end to the other. Perfect for networking our two computers with a router.
2,get one at your lcoal Staples or Office Depot.,This one kind of .... It has these rubberized protectors molded over the end clip levers that are very difficult to release when the cable is installed. I finally removed it and bought one at Staples which works great.
4,Yummy!,"This fragrance is one of my favorites. It is soft, yet slightly sweet and spicy. It is very sensual. I love it!!"
4,"Great, if your PC meets the requirements","If you like simulation games and airports, this game is great. However, you had BETTER have a Pentium II processor with at least 200 MhZ. I bought this game to use on my AMD K6-2 350 MhZ processor, and found nothing but trouble. I had to re-install it once because the main screen was glitching. After I got that taken care of, I discovered that the scrolling in the game was about as smooth as sandpaper, and hard to control the mouse. Luckily I also have a Pentium II computer, and it works fine there.I also found some data mix-ups with the populations of cities, I don't think Los Angeles only has 550,000 people! I also think that the pop. of 4,000,000 for Mexico City was a little off. As well as 30,000,000 for Miami.If you don't mind these kinds of problems, buy the game, it's great. Otherwise, save your money.I would also recommend RollerCoaster Tycoon, which is MUCH more platform friendly."
5,It is a really good game!,You get to choose a city from all around the world. It takes a while to get companies like Delta or USAir. You should get it!!!
3,Nice but needs some more improvements.,"The objective, setting and aim of the game is very appealing but there are many problems which needs to be solved to make optimum use of it. First of all, there are many errors, for example when you save the game and when load once again all the planes have disappeared. At times, saved games won't even load and you will have to start over again and this is quite frustrating.Time is not respected in the sense that you see planes land and take off at different times, times which are not corresponding to the schedules.Moreover names are not written properly, for example we have Bowing instead of Boeing, names of certain airlines also differ.Consequently for those who are looking good simulation games I won't propose that I prefer Roller Coaster Tycoon.There are many things which lacks in Airport Tycoon and it's not realistic as well."
3,Not the High Flyer,"When I first saw this game come out I thought that it would be great. Well after purchasing it I found out that it wasn't all that it should be. The graphics on it weren't as good as they looked on the box. Overall gameplay was just plain bad. The game made no sense because you never could keep enough money to keep your airport open. I felt that this was just plain bad, but would recommend it to play because it is fun to look at."
1,Awful,"The game is horribly designed. One of the first things you must do is place the airport runway, and you are required to do this without being able to zoom out far enough to see the ends. It gets worse from there."
1,I don't know,"I haven't been able to play this game yet as it, apparently, only instals on a windows 95/98/me system. I have an XP and it won't even open the install applet to install it. When I get around to setting my 98SE back up I will try it on there and then maybe I will have something to say about the game play of this game."
2,Buy at your own risk!,"A very good idea for a game. There's a lot of room for improvement, different ways to play the game, etc. Nothing will ever be the same. Unfortunately, it's very predictable. It's quite capitalistic-like, but too extreme. The game starts off by giving you NO business so you're in the red. This can be overcome by little initial spending. Soon after this turn for the worse - business is booming! Contracts coming from all over the place. THEN...you experience a drought that is impossible to overcome with NO explanation. This has happened to me multiple times with no remedy."
2,"All right, but could use ALOT of fixing up","It's fairly good but there are major flaws. First of all, When you opened a saved game, all the planes you had at youre airport are gone. Also, there is a limit on how many runways you can have, the flights are never on time, the game simulation time is very slow, the tutorial takes literally 40 min., and declined companies keep coming back. It's ok, but there are better things you can buy."
3,has potential,"This game has great graphics,but poor instructionsI found this to be very hard to get started. Where are allthe people and cars? This is not for any child.but priced good"
1,This game is the worst,"I got 5 words for you. Do Not Buy This Game!!!... I think it is stupid, sim coaster, polilical tycoon, roller coaster tycoon and even Dino park tycoon is better i like all of this but airport tycoon is the worst, the maunul tells you to do one thing but the ""game"" tells you to do another. Save yourself from anger don't buy this game. There is no ""players' Guide"" and you have no idea what to do."
4,"Good, But Not Great",This is a good bussiness type game. You accept or decline contracts from airlines. Some of the airlines want special things like check in desks.You can also get cargo planes. Some might want cargo facilities. Each flight that comes in you get a certain amount of money. The bigger the plane the more money you get. The smaller the plane the less money you get. Some people might threaten to bomb your terminal. Fires might go off some were in your airport. Planes might crash in mid air or while their landing. You should have fire stations and hospitals for that. In the long run i think this is a good game.
2,this game [stinks],"well i am a big fan of tycoon games but this one really bites the dust. Now i think it is a really great concept and i dont mind the graphics. All the buildings are pretty cool but there is one problem. One of the things that i like most about tycoon games is to watch the people in the game. Well in this game the people dont do anything and it gets boring to play, in fact its depressing. There is no noise and sound, its boring to watch and even more boring to play. If you want a good tycoon game, one that i think is much better is airline tycoon. It is the same concept but a much better game. Take my advice and dont waste your money on this game"
2,"Good idea, bad development","I was very excited when I bought the game because I am a huge fan of tycoon games. Unfortunatedly, this one wasn't as good as you could expect from the name and the idea. After you open your airport and get your first two or three contracts, the game enters in an endless task of approving and rejecting business and airlines contracts and there is nothing else to do. Basically, after the first two or three hours of playing it gets boring doing over and over the same things."
2,Good vs. Bad....,"I bought this game at wal-mart (for half the price...), and I've done the tutorial, read the instruction book, spent a few hours trying to play...not very entertaining. It has BASIC graphics, very simple (not user friendly, basic programing). Very difficult to master, but if you've got the time, you could possibly enjoy this game. One of the other reviews said looking online for strategy guides, again...how much time do you really want to spend playing this game?I buy a lot and play a lot of these 'tycoon' or simulation games, and I can tell you by experience, this game would be at the bottom of my list of favs. Hope that helps!"
2,Great Potential,"Wait for the patch. This game has far too many bugs, very disappointing. But it is otherwise a cool game. You can manage everything in your airport. I like how you can negotiate contracts with businesses to place things like fast food joints in your terminal. I'm waiting to find a patch (something you can download that will fix the bugs) for this game so i can finally enjoy it."
1,Great idea -- abysmal execution,"This could have been a great game. It has all the elements to succeed and is well-conceived. The designer included all sorts of elements from airport design, a financial model, negotiation of contracts and numerous camera views such as walking through the terminal. Unfortunately, the execution is awful. The graphics are 5 years behind (& ugly to boot); the interface is awkward; there is no sound to speak of; there are numerous bugs; the manual is no help; construction of the airport is clumsy; and not much happens once the game runs. Did I say the graphics are only 5 years behind. Compare the passengers walking through the terminal to the Dire Straits video from the early 1980's (I want my MTV)."
1,Very Disappointed,"I am not much of a game expert, but I do know what I like to play. I decided I wanted the game because the concept of running my own airport would be fun. I even read a few of the reviews on amazon. My husband seen the game at [local store] including in a pack with other games. He only paid [some money] for the pack and I see why. First the box said airport tycoon, but the cd saids Air Mogul. I guess it is the same game. When I first seen the graphics it was awful. I still thought there would be hope. The game play is not easy to understand and the game tutorial was worthless in fact it was mess up itself. I just didn't like it at all. I was very disappointed. So if you are just a person who like to play games just for the fun of it, and not one of those hard gamers don't waste your money on this game. It wasn't even worth a few dollars. Now one of the other games in the pack I am currently playing is RailRoad Tycoon 2 and it was definitely worth the few dollars."
1,?????This Game is confusing and stupid?????,This game is confusing and stupid!! It is hard to find out what each butten means but please use your money wisely and dont get this game!!!!! Get Roller Coaster Tycoon or The Sims.
4,European buyers,Great game but if you live in Europe you should buy Airport Inc. which is exactly the same game and you can find it at amazon.co.uk for a cheaper price and faster delivery time
3,Hard but ok game,"Airport Tycoon is a hard game to master and because of that is is not very fun till you get better at it. You run out of money real quick and it takes lots of time to get any thing new. Pros- Good graphics,good bulding optians,fun game Cons- No instrion booklet, hard game, crashes sometime, lose money to quick, takes to long to get new building optians. My Adivice- dont by this game unless you REALLY like tycoon games if you do buy it after playing it for a while and you see how hard it is get a money trainer off of the internet."
5,Very good game,"This game is very cool only for people who like airport maintainment and airport economy. I love this kind of games. Airport Tycoon is also a really hard game. You better learn first to play this game to like it, get it and understand it.You can also accept or decline contracts from 200 different airlines."
1,Not Worth It,"This game is rather hard to understand, not to mention the irritating Middle Eastern Music It forces you to listen to as you try and play it. At first, I was excited to build my own airport with security and gates and everything, but the makeshift passengers could care less about boundaries and markers, so the game automatically gets the [worst] rating. The Planes that come and go on the runways are sortof interesting, but when asked to sign a new contract with an airline, you don't even notice a different plane coming in, they all look the same! Also, the title of this game is ""Airport Tycoon,"" but, when installed, the game is somehow renamed ""Air Mogul"" which is the stupidest thing I have ever seen.This game is a great idea, it just has to be developed further into something that works!"
2,Airport Tycoon is trash,I bought the game with high hopes having played Roller Coaster Tycoon for many months. This game is just a disappointment. It takes a long time for one year to pass and the game just creeps by. I start the game and then walk away to do other stuff and then come back and clear up any trouble that has developed and then walk off again. It doesn't hold my interest. The graphics are poor to say the least and there are not any instructions to help you get started. This game is not worth it. Go buy RailRoad Tycoon instead.
1,Bad,"This game looked good from the front and back covers. However, I can never seem to start it I get to the main menu and boom. Im back at my desktop. The tech support part of the manual isnt that good and if u call the tech support phone #, they need to know all this stuff about your computer and they dont tell you how to find any of it out. I would not reccomned buying this game."
1,Horrible...total waste of money,"This is a horrible game. Do not waste your money. The interface is terrible, the menue vanishes at times and you have to restart the game as well as the lag of just trying to get the mouse to move to a position. There is no help for the game at all. I have tried four times to create an airport and never get any contracts and the place runs out of money...game over.Total and complete waste of energy. You have been warned. I hate that I have to give it one star."
4,Addictive,"This is a very addictive little game. The biggest challenge is to learn how to generate money with your airport. And, i found that a bit difficult to work out, but after that it is fairly easy, and you will have an over-sized, elaborate airport of your very own in no time at all. If you enjoy tycoon games, then you will probably like this one. I would have rated it higher, but once you figure the economics out, it is a bit too easy."
3,Fun But I've Played Better,"I got this game for, like many others, the ability to create my own Airport. It took me a few trys to get a successful airport but after that its clear sailing if you do it right. This game is good but i woul recomend Roller Coaster Tycoon over this."
3,Good graphics with couple of bugs. Bad manual,"What to do? Do i build a big, ugly, busy airport or a small,nice, little one? Well that is 4 u 2 to decide. Airport Tycoonallows u 2 do that. Build ur own airport and manage it. Airport Tycoon's manual is horrible, does not have much in it. U have 2 learn how 2 play through the tutorial (which runs low on money before it finishes the airport, not playable tutorial). Big learning curve 2 build a good airport. I noticed that some buildings near the edge of the screen tend 2 dissapear, but if u scroll that way it reappears. Different cameras with good graphics (dispite the bugs), can view airport through taxi cabs, travelers, incoming flights, etc. Very addicting once u build a working airport..."
3,watchout,"This item has 3 1/8' x 1 1/4' LCD display, not LED display.If you are looking for LED display, this is a huge deception.Look at the picture very carefully. It looks like LCD display."
4,"I would give it five, but...","I really like the availability of a calcium/magnesium supplement in powder form. And I am sure KAL does a fine job in quality testing. I give it four stars only because you must be very careful with the dosage. I used their recommendation for a few weeks and wound up missing several days of work with terrible diarhea. After taking several weeks away, I started again with half the dosage, and have had no problems.I recommend taking this conjunction with a good vitamin D3/K2 supplement."
5,Good Product,I put this in my shakes and smoothies as a calcium supplement and it works great. Always mixes smooth and no clumps.
2,a novel that never gels,"This novel starts out interestingly enough, but then seems to run out of steam. Cordrescu's idea of linking the past (Bathory), with present (the current problems in the Balkans as represented in the figure Drake), is solid. But as the novel unfolds, he barely scratches the surface of possibilities. The litany of horrors -- and there are plenty -- eventually leave the reader bored. The violence and sex become gratuitous when it becomes apparent that there is no progression in the story, and that what you're reading seems more and more like a cut and paste job. The last two hundred pages are torture (maybe that's the point). Still, you can find some good stretches in this book. But if you have something else on the shelf (King, Straub -- if its horror you want), I suggest starting there."
5,Very good - excellent narrative skills,"I read this book about 3 years ago. The author is Hungarian(I believe), but currently living in New Orleans. His narrative skills are very captivating. He pulls you into the book almost as quickly as Anne Rice. The book is based on historical fact, and yet you feel as if you are there while reading it! If you like vampire stories - a definate must read!"
2,Where's the beef???,"A surprizingly disappointing rendition of a potentially exillarating story. I have read articles and other short stories written by Godrescu, and I expected so much more... (Good thing I didn't pay full price.) The story within story set up didn't impress me, but he could have been worked it better. Historical details were Ok, perhaps one day I'll visit Hungary. The gory details were lacking. There wasn't enough anything - not enough gore, not enough history, not enough sex, not enough horror, not enough details; just not enough! To the Author I say: ""Read one of Gary Jennings books."""
1,Trash in Silken Clothing,"While Codrescu's prose is clear and elegant, all those showy words can't conceal this novel's true, trashy nature. Countess Bathory is indeed an intriguing personage, but the story of her life is contorted by Codrescu's heavy-handed storyline and his unsuccessful attempts at weaving two disparate stories into one effective drama. The gratuitious sex and violence, while intended to be shocking, comes off as cheap, crude, and rather embarrassing. Those interested in the history of Countess Elizabeth Bathory should look elsewhere."
3,"Exciting, yet somewhat slow plot","I'm half Hungarian, and have been to Hungary many times. I'm 13, and I thought that this book was something I shouldn't have read! I feel that some of the sexuality was not necessary, but in a way, it explained some of Countess Bathory's actions. It was hard to finish the book (I read it in 3 days) because I felt disgusted and frustrated that Countess Bathory herself was not tortured as she had done to innocent girls. I threw the book at my wall a couple of times in disgust. This is a very disturbing book, and I don't recommend it to someone my age!"
2,B Movie Material from a Likeable Source,"I wanted to like this book. I really enjoy Codrescu's essays on NPR, especially when they touch on topics pertaining to New Orleans, where I lived for five years. I also thought the subject matter had some potential. Unfortunately, he is trying too hard to follow in the footsteps of his fellow New Orleanian, Anne Rice. The portrayal of the countess is really unconvincing. She wants eternal youth. Ok, so? She comes across as about as complex as the evil queen in Disney's Snow White. The ""present day"" subplot makes the game, Clue, seem like an Umberto Eco masterpiece of intricacy. For readers who want a complex representation of a reprehensible villain of the middle ages, go to Joris Karl Huysmans' La Bas for his depiction of Gilles de Rais, who made the Marquis de Sade look like a neophyte. Codrescu should stick to what he does best - write clever essays for NPR. He's no great shakes as a novelist."
3,"The one is intense, even by Codrescu's standards.","Whether based on fact or not, this book presents a lot of questions on the nature of evil, and what turns human beings into monsters. Was it the age she lived in, what she saw and experienced, especially as a child, her loneliness, madness, or a combination of all of these? Give human beings enough pain and suffering, whether individually or as a whole, and they will dish it out themselves, in bigger and better amounts; is that what Codrescu seems to be saying? The author touches on this as being part of the very nature or Eastern Europe, ingrained forever. Unfortunately, this was not developed further. Perhaps that was the purpose of the modern day subplot, which by itself made no sense. Codrescu brings us through Hell, but never tells us why. What was his point...? DO NOT read this book if you upset easily"
2,Made me sorry i bought this trash!,"Although I was caught up in this trashy novel trying to pass itself off as history, I did enjoy the author's style of story telling. I only got half way through, when I scolded myself for wasting too much time on this garbage. Nothing but glossy porn."
2,an interesting subject but a boring story,"I was quite intrigued with the subject of this story, and it started off with a BANG! But it then proceeded to dwindle away. None of the characters seem fleshy, (especially the victims!!!), and l felt that l should really care about the 650 odd murders, but didn't because it was too clinical. I couldn't even read the last 100 odd pages, only flicked through, because nothing seemed to happen. I looked forward to reading this book much, much more than actually reading it. One of those that 'could've been' a good read."
2,This book rubs your nose in the ugliest side of human nature,"This book is a confusing mixture. It tells the story of a rather fascinating human monster, but gives the reader no real understanding or empathy for any of its characters. The voices of the book are too removed, too cold. The countess tormented and killed her hundreds of young women with no interest in the reality of their lives and interests; the book chronicles the killings in the same manner, and thus fails to involve the reader. Even the parallel plot line of the modern-day Drake, drawn into the mystical world of immortal evil, fails to involve the reader closely. Too much blood, pain, and perverse excitement, not enough understanding. All in all, it was lurid and adolescent."
3,Not for the faint of heart,"I borrowed this book from my husband when we were still just dating. I turned it over to him when I was finished and told him it should be burned. (Jokingly, of course) I am a horror fiend, blood and stomach-turning gore I can stand but some of the sexual encounters in The Blood Countess made me ill. (If the word 'incest' bothers you, run away from this book as fast as you can.)A few people on here were complaining about the historical inaccuracies, but a little leeway is typically given for HISTORICAL FICTION.I personally skipped every Drake chapter because the Elizabeth chapters were ultimately more interesting. The Blood Countess is beautifuly written, even during gore and sex scenes, and is as seductive and dangerous as Countess Bathory herself."
2,Historically Inaccurate,"Just to give a brief example, the Peasant Rebellion led byGyörgy Dózsa took place in the year 1514, forty-six yearsbefore Erzsébet Báthory was born. Yet Codrescu has Dózsakilling family members of Countess Báthory in front of hereyes.The book is nothing more than anti-Hungarian propagandawritten by a (Romanian) with a politcal agenda.An earlier book by Codrescu, ""The Hole in the Flag"" was anoble effort, but ""The Blood Countess"" is disappointingto say the least."
1,Kinda Sleazy,"This book was a huge disappointment. I was looking forward to an informative historical novel about a truly terrifying woman. Instead what I got was a cold, dull, mildly pornographic tale.Don't get me wrong, I expected some pretty graphic stuff given the subject matter, but there were a few too many completely gratuitous sex scenes seemingly randomly thrown in. Even secondary and tertiary characters were given perverse romps in the hay. I know Codrescu is an intelligent man--you can't be an NPR commentator and be a dummy--but I can't help picturing him rubbing his hands and grinning lasciviously as he wrote this stuff.This is not the scholarly work you might expect--consider yourself warned."
5,Does Codrescu mean corkscrew?,"This book will yank you in so many directions you'll be numb.Very dirty in spots. Calling it pornographic would pigeon hole it wrongly.But a fascinating mix of a modern story and a old legend. I enjoyed each one and how they mixed.I shouldn't like it (because of the violence), but I loved it.By the way, notice how the negative reviewers didn't surrender themselves to the stories and read every word. I skim some documents for work. Books I read everyword, and lose myself in the story."
1,a waste of time.,"i just finished reading this book. barely. only because i couldent stand to leave it unfinished. i skimmed much of the end of it (just to get through it!) found the ending unexiting and uneventfull. the ""present"" part of it was borring. more of a perverse tale that i wasent too interested in finishing. the book failed to meet my expectations. while the author has a way with words and such... the story was dull, dragged on, and never realy climaxed. maybe it did but i was too bored to catch it."
1,I thought it would never end...,"I enthusiastically purchased this book in the hopes of finding out about the infamous serial killer Elizabeth Bathory. Well, I guess my first mistake would be hoping to find out information from a ""novel."" The author confused me to no end, shifting back and forth, spending far too much time making up scenarios that I'm pretty certain never happened. While he claims that information contained in the book is ""based on historical events,"" I think shock value was the real aim here and based simply on that, the author does not fail.Many times I wanted to simply put the book down, but me, always a champion for the underdog, thought it would get better. It never did. If you want to find out about Elizabeth Bathory, this is certainly not the book to read."
1,Not worth my time,"Despite its colorful vocabulary, The Blood Countess has no merit in terms of content. The author simply describes the perverted, without having a pertinent message. If you enjoy reading about disgusting fantasies, then, by all means, read this book. But, if you are seeking a book that is more historically focused, look elsewhere."
1,Failure upon launch,"Bought the 25 ft which worked fine, however the 14 foot cut in and out with signal and only after I replaced it was everything working as expected. Unfortunately, probably more trouble to actually return it."
4,good - BUT,"This book is a good romantic adventure originally published as a Harlequin Intrigue. I wish that it had been orginally stated that this book was a Harlequin Intrigue published in 1987, it might stop someone from making a duplicate purchase."
2,"Wow, not her usual stuff!","I found this book at a thrift store after having read a few of her Maura Isles books...and boy, was I disappointed. I told my husband that it was more like a Harlequin romance book, then I find out here that it was originally published as a Harlequin! And not even a great one at that...I mean, how many times does a person start to trust someone, then totally flip out on them, then do that a few more times. It got very tedious. But I really love the books she's written in the past decade or so, so don't be deterred by this one."
1,What a disappointment!,"I listened to this book on CD on a long car ride and was very disappointed, especially after I'd assured my partner that based on all the wonderful books I'd read by this author we were sure to enjoy the eight hour tale. The characters are unbelievably shallow, especially the main female who is a laughable caricature of a lady in distress. Madly in love with her uncommonly good looking husband of two months, she finds that it's just as easy to fall head over heels in love with the state department worker who has been assigned to give her the bad news about her husband's untimely death. We found ourselves ridiculing these two characters as they bungled their way through Europe, in search of the husband, who may not be dead after all."
1,Call for help,"I bought this novel expecting a thriller, instead the only value I got from it was a comedy one. The characters are incredibly shallow, the plot denies credibility and the style is Barbara Cartland. If you're looking for a thriller don't look here. Romantic comedy wold be a more accurate classification!"
5,"Very helpful, especially for podiatry students!!","This book is fantastic! Dr. Christman actually taught at my school (TUSPM) until this past June. He is a fantastic teacher that is very knowledgable, and that shows in his text book. This book has an entire chapter on anatomical views of the foot and ankle. You learn how to take a radiograph and how to read one. You learn about different angles and why one view would be better than another. He tells you everything you need to know about radiographs of the (osseous and some soft tissue) anatomy of the foot and ankle. This book is a must for podiatric medical students!"
5,Dust Ruffle,"These items arrived on time. I have two adjustable beds and you can't use regular dust ruffels on them. I was able to attach these dust ruffels with small pins (made specifilly for this product, sold separately). The dust ruffel stays in place and now there is no gap between the duvet and the floor."
2,Inferior material,"Ordered this product about a week before Thanksgiving and was surprised it arrived two days before the holiday. The wrap around concept is just great. If only the material was a better quality, it would be perfect. I ordered the biege, which is very light and it's a little transparant. When you're standing away form the bed, you can see the space between the box spring and the floor. We do have a cal-king so there is not that much fullness to the ruffle. If it were a queen, there would be more fullness and it probably wouln't be so see through. But I have to say that the fabric is very thin anyway. I was disappointed in the quality of the product. It doesn't look at all like the picture shown. Quite misleading. Also, I was charged over $10.00 for shipping and if I return it, they want to withhold 10% of the original price for restocking. Guess I'll just live with it for a while and keep looking for a better quality. I feel really taken."
3,BED SKIRT,"This waas exactly what I was looking for. Delivery was as one would expect. The odor of the material was awful! It took 3 washing with fabric softener to clear that smell. It was so bad, I called the seller. The fact that I could finally get rid of the odor, I kept it. The price was very fair."
5,Wrap around dust ruffle,"Very nice actually. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, considering the price. Not having to remove the mattress from the bed is a real plus. To know one needs special pins to keep it is place would have been a plus to know beforehand, having never used wraparounds before I didn't have any on hand, and could have ordered them on line at the same time if I had known they were needed. I had to settle for the little screw in upholstery pins, because that is the only kind WalMart carries here. These do nor hols as well as the two pronged type."
3,Not what I expected,"The good thing about this is that I don't tuck the ruffle in when I tuck the sheet. However, it doesn't seem to hang evenly and I was surprised at how flimsy the fabric is."
2,DUST RUFFLE,"Nice material. Well made but way way too short unless your looking for a 10 inch drop don't bother. Way way too short...also can't return because Brown's Linens enclosed a letter that said 10% re-stocking fee, no shipping cost to be refunded and if item was sent with free shipping, the amount they paid to ship to me will be deducted. Not worth spending more money to send it back to them with all the deductions I would end up owing them even more money...Oh well, maybe someone else could use it, I'll put it in my garage sale item pile."
1,Doesn't stay put,"I ordered this dust ruffle in part of the good reviews it received, but was very disappointed when it finally arrived. Aside from the flimsiness of the fabric, my major gripe is the darned thing won't stay put on the bed -- some part or another is always sliding up or down. Forget trying to make the bed. No amount of tucking seems to keep it in place.It's on a standard queen bed with a rather thick mattress, but the depth of the mattress shouldn't matter. All in all, it looks better than a bare bed frame, but it's way too much work to keep it looking nice. Who needs a bed skirt that has a habit of wandering? Not me -- I like my linens to stay where I put them."
1,Don't waste your money or time!,"I liked the idea of not having to lift the mattress to position the bed ruffle, but it doesn't work. Parts of the skirt ride up in between the box spring and mattress, leaving that part of the ruffle several inches off the ground. Other parts slide down on the box spring leaving the bottom dragging on the ground. It's impossible to keep the whole thing in place and equally level to the ground. I'm always tugging it down in places, or pushing it up in other places. I guess the idea is for the weight of the mattress to keep it in place, but it doesn't on my bed. Also, the material is thin and looks cheap. And it doesn't go around an entire full size bed, so you better have part of the bed against a wall. I wish I had sent it back during the 30-day return period."
2,dust ruffle,"Everything about the delivery and packaging was just fine, however, I don't really like the product. It looks very cheap and i hate the color. But I don't blame anyone for this. It's just turned out to be not really my favorite house item! I think it looks more attractive in the picture."
2,Not worth the money,I did not like this dust ruffle. I bought it for my daughter's twin bed and it does not stay in place. It also came with a lot of loose threads hanging from it when I opened the package. I was very disappointed.
3,Dust Ruffle Review,"Dust ruffles material could have been a little nicer but was ok. Also, arrived extremely wrinkled. The fit was just ok. Was made for both Queen and King. As I have a queen bed ruffle did sag a bit. Not enough to send back though."
4,easy-to-install dust ruffle,"This dust ruffle is cheap, easy to put on the bed, and looks passable. It arrived wadded up and very wrinkled, necessitating either ironing or washing and ironing. I chose the easier method and put it around my mattress quickly, needing no help to install it. It looks crisp and clean but not fancy. It is adequate for my little-used guest bed. It will be quick to take off and wash when that is needed."
3,Some improvement,"They were hard to put on by myself and I had to pin them in place to keep them from popping off, but they will be easier to take off for washing.That's about the only advantage they have over the old type of bed skirt. They look nice."
1,Don't Buy,"Do not purchase this video. There are only 5 fights and the production quality is horrible. Two of the five fights start in round 2. Nothing shown on video beyond the one hour original airing on HDNET. I love MMA, but skip this DVD, I wish I had!"
3,Leaves Something to be Desired,"I have to say that my biggest beef with this recording is with the ""Military"" symphony. Considering that the percussion, and in particular its contrast with the strings, is so important to the work, I felt that the percussion was minimized and treated almost embarassingly. In fact, all these performances are very heavy on the strings and tend do downplay the surprises in Haydn's works so much that they become kind of boring. In the end this album is not so bad as to give it one or two stars, but it does leave something to be desired."
5,Cool puzzle,This puzzle is so interesting. there are so many proverbs within this puzzle that you could stare at it for hours trying to find them all.
4,Fun Entertaining - worth buying,"I got this for a present for my friend's birthday and the 3 of us spent several hours putting this together. Then you have lots of fun trying to remember the associated the proverbs to the images.It would make a good educational tool, especially if you're in some english philosophy type class discussing proverbs."
4,Wheres my proverb list?,"I love this puzzle! Its far from your average puzzle and thats what I love about it. Its a lot fun puting it together, and even more fun trying to figure out all the different proverbs. The ONLY problem i had was that the puzzle is supposed to come with a list of the proverbs and idioms depicted in the puzzle, and mine DIDNT come with the list. Since there is over 300 proverbidioms, it is VERY hard to figure out what all of them are without it. It left me very curious. Overall though, this puzzle is great! it was a blast to put together, and fun just to look at!"
5,Puzzles Never Go Out of Style,This puzzle challenges the intellect. Friends can discuss the idioms and proverbs while working together.
4,The dark side of the river is revealed.,"Keepers was hard to put down. I read it in two days. It held my attention and I remained curious throughout the book as to where we were going. What did all these people have in common?The book was well written. The setting was perfect for the story. I have been to the bluffs, the mounds, the islands and caves of the river. The author did a nice job of taking me from nostalgia all the way to the occult. I loved the mystery and dark secrets of the river.Schulz has a bit of Stephen King lurking about. Are his ""keepers"" of the same breed as Kings ""low men""?If you have been to the river read the book."
1,Jet Fighter IV,"To begin with, I wanted to give it 0 stars. I never flew a single mission!!!This title is a huge rip off. I spent several days trying to get it working and never got off the ground. It does not run on XP and the support sites have all been pulled. Why? Too many complaints maybe? The Global Star and Talonsoft people won't be getting any more of my money!!!"
3,"Before there was the Internet, there was....","The Guinness Books of World Records. The 1989 version was the last one I got, and I read it cover to cover. I was in junior high school then, and being able to pick out this fact or that fact was quite an accomplishment for my age group. This book was quite long, and the amount of feats and facts was in it was a challenge to go thru, but still manageable at under 500 pages. Nowadays, the Guinness books have all sorts of stuff that were not included back in 1989, like the longest ear hairs!. But we have the Internet now, which can provide all sorts of facts that even the people of Guinness could not have imagined."
4,Great way to travel,"Bought several of these a few months ago for my children and me. My mom borrowed one for a trip. She loved it so much I bought this one for her birthday. Needless to say, she was thrilled with the gift. I also like the fact they come in so many different fabrics. We can each tell ours from each others.More importantly, these pillows cradle the neck very well. They are good not only while sleeping upright as when traveling, but for sleeping while lying down. I used mine in lieu of a hotel pillow recently for several nights and slept really well. I also use mine while on the couch watching TV. While they might look like a novelty pillow, they are much more."
3,"Feels nice, but also feels cheap.","Ok, I agree with some others that this item is cheaply made. The material isn't great and it's more plush than I thought it would be. I also didn't get it in black & white. It came in an off white (almost extremely light teal) and black. Not ugly though, so I'm ok with that...it's just inconsistent. A note should be put on here that it may not come as pictured. For $10, I think it's a bit pricey (again because it feels cheap). BUT, it is quite comfortable for the neck. The only annoyance is that since it's bulky, it may push your head forward, therefore arching your back in a funny posture. So if you're going to use this while sitting on a couch or on a plane (if you're small like me and can't reach the top of the seat with your neck), you'll need a pillow to support your back as well. I bought 3 others for gifts but I feel like perhaps I shouldn't have..."
3,Just okay,"Purchased two of these. My daughter thought it was uncomfortable and too hard. I had hoped to use it for travel, but found it too large to be convenient. I think it's okay for using at home for neck support while reading, etc."
2,Promising author; stories of Brooklyn family life ring true.,"Pulaski's portrayal of family life in Brooklyn is masterful. By seamlessly incorporating Yiddish-English dialect into his prose and describing both cityscapes and internal psychological landscapes in painstaking detail, Pulaski draws me into most of his stories.I thought that the stories depicting his wife's side of the family fell flat, took confusing turns, and were generally less believable. The early sexual experiences of a young girl and the inner workings of this other family seemed to me beyond his knowledge, and thus beyond his considerable ability.All in all, it's worth reading and I look forward to reading more by this author."
1,I want my money back,"I have been struggling with this for 3 days. it is very difficult. Instead of being able to enter measurements, for lot, lawn, etc, it is all done w/pointer & is very imprecise, I am ready to toss this one & get a different one!"
3,"If you want to search for plants, it's worth it",The landscaping features are limiting and a bit difficult to get used to. However it's very large plant database with pictures was very helpful to me. I ended up just using that and found plants for the particular area I needed. It lets you enter every possible piece of criteria to search for just what you need.
1,Sad,Initially I thought the software was difficult to use. Then I realized that it was just unuseable.
1,Not what expected,Music was terrible - gave the cd away. The cd was nothing like the traditional music I grew up with. The music could have been from another region.
1,Needs better editing- mistakes found,"The judges for our trivia contest used this book as the arbiter for disputed questions tonight, and the NYT Almanac was wrong or incomplete on two questions, verified by multiple sources. Number one, The place Lee surrendered to Grant was not a ""Courthouse"" in Appomatox, Va.... rather, It was a farm in the *town* of ""Appomatox Courthouse"", VA. A quick Google search will confirm this on dozens of sources.The question the Almanac was incomplete on, was about the Definition of ""DVD"". Properly and technically known as Digital Versatile Disk, the NYT Almanac only metion only a colloquial ""Digital Video Disk"", which is common, but not accurate. A DVD can contain video, but not all DVD's contain video.I wonder how many more mistakes there are in this book? Yeah, I'm a sore loser, but right is right and wrong is wrong. Maybe the Almanac makes up stuff too?"
3,Pretty decent,"Tracked this down because Cathey Paine (who played Leslie Van Houten in the 1976 tv movie Helter Skelter) was in it. Wasn't really sure what to expect, but wasn't let down; it's a storyline that may seem a bit cliched now, although looking back it must have seemed fairly fresh back in the mid 1970s. Paine puts in a good performance and is gorgeous!"
3,calculate & shine,"This is a good Math program once you get the hang of it. The tutorial is easy to follow; however, you must be computer literate in order too navigate through some of the instructions and formulas. This program is intended for students that want a quick review. Mathematics Complete provides an excellent calculator for complex formulas."
3,An item for a future garage sale,"While this pot was certainly useful for it's intended purpose, I did find it somewhat awkward to remove the hot, steamed asparagus to a serving plate. Because the asparagus is standing upright in a deep, narrow pot, in a wire basket, it inevitably fell out like pick up sticks, and I'd have to get out the tongs and rearrange the stalks on the platter. Some stalks would break in the process. I think the idea of cooking asparagus upright like this is to cook the thicker end of the stalks more than the delicate flower end, but a special pot seems quite unnecessary. Why make a simple steaming process so complicated.At some point, I tried roasting asparagus on a cookie pan in the oven. Just drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper, toss gently to coat. It is quick, easy and in my opinion, more flavorful. My family prefers the roasted version."
2,Mediocre Purchase,"This is advertized as a pasta/asparagus cooker but arrived with no cooking instructions, no cleaning instructions and no user manual or any written documentation of any kind. Kinda chintzy considering the price."
3,Limited inspiration,"Amongst these nine flowing meditations on water (plus one), Tiqui and Amazon definitely stick out as being the most noticeably, and engagingly beautiful, while the great majority, as per the norm with Glass, falls prey to an extended methodism with a repetitious, although exotically pretty, palate."
4,Well I think it's another essential Philp Glass!,"This is my first review ever - what's made me send one in? Well I bought 'aguas de amazonia' by uakti (music composed by Philip Glass) in spite of the review. I've only listened to it twice so far but I really like it. The instruments used give it a more fluid sound than that usually experienced with PG's music. The only previously released track is Metamorphosis 1 but this new version is quite interesting. All the other tracks were recorded December 1993 but have not been released before and don't sound dated. My first introduction to PG was Koyaanisqatsi and I've got most of his recordings now. Favourites are Koyaanisqatsi, Akhnaten, 1000 Airplanes on the Roof. I'm waiting for the third in the reworking of David Bowie - have Low Symphony and Heroes Symphony already. I live in Swindon, England and am surprised by the amount of PG music used as background on TV especially for adverts."
4,A re-orchestration versus new music,"I like this CD quite a bit, but I wished there was some mention that a lot of this work seems like re-orchestrations of his earlier work (most notably the Dance Pieces album). I've got most of his released work and have been a fan for a long time. Utaki has an excellent an innovative approach to his work, so that recommends this, but don't expect 70 minutes of new music, 'cause that it ain't."
5,"Peter Newell verse is witty, sharp and humorous","My parents were given this book when they were children, read it to me when I was a child and now I read it to my children. Children thoroughly enjoy this book but it wasn't until I picked this book up and started to read this as an adult did I fully appreciate why Tom Pott's bullet suddenly stopped when it hit the new brides freshly baked cake. Read this book to your children and yourself, for all of you will enjoy this book tremendously."
3,"Fun, but...","I remember this 1908 book from my childhood. My copy originally belonged to my father (born in 1900), and would probably be a priceless collector's item now (along with those baseball cards from the 1940's), but it got lost some time in the last 60 years! So I enjoyed this book as a nostalgia trip, and the text and pictures were even cleverer than I remembered them. A couple of caveats... as other reviewers have pointed out, the registration of the hole isn't very good, which detracts from some of the pages. And the book isn't complete: without notice, at least one pair of pages that I remember (possibly more) has been censored, as a rather mild racial stereotype (which is why the book has the rather odd number of 56 pages)."
1,Cheap reprint of a classic book,"This is a crummy reprint of a wonderful classic children's book. First of all, there is no hole in the book, which spoils the novelty. Second, the original colors are missing, as the pictures are all printed in black-and-white. Third, the pages are printed on the wrong sides, so the text you read on any given page doesn't correspond to the picture on the facing page! If you remember reading The Hole Book as a child, as I do, you will be tremendously disappointed by this reprint."
3,Not so good reprint,"The idea of this book is good, but the hole punched in it doesn't line up with the obvious place there's a hole in the picture. Very annoying. Also the humor is full of stereotypes."
2,Not for Todays Children,Don't get this book for a child. It makes fun of black people and a wild animal gets killed.
5,Elusive Face Cream,"My Mom has been using Ultima 11 for the past 40 years. When it became unavailable in canada, I began purchasing it in JC Penny stores in the U.S. Then it could only be found in the southern states and now only on Amazon. My Mom swears by this creme and has never really found any other brand here to replace it. I purchased a bottle for her as a Christmas present and she was thrilled. So, thank you Amazon. You made an 87 year old lady happy. :)"
1,crap,"crap, the album is crap...not worth buying. maybe listen to once or twice but for us hardcore pantera fans (u know, the ones who were around when the album 1st came out) this album is just phil's way of getting more money."
4,walk is a great song but not pantera's best,walk is an excellent song by pantera but it is not good enough to pay this much money for it. I suggest u just get the vulgar display of power cd which has walk on it and it costs much less money.
1,Rock 'N Roll Repulsion,"It's tragic that a group like this became as highly popular and successful as it did, considering that Kiss was a band that really could do nothing, musically speaking. Their live ""act""-or whatever it was-was something that belonged in a circus or perhaps in a Las Vegas hotel, rather than in the real musical world. In fact, I remember some kids in school who were huge fans of this abomination, and they all seemed to be in true need of psychological help. And to hear Gene Simmons, who sounds more like a Jewish accountant than a musician, which he barely is to begin with, go on the Howard Stern show and take credit for virtually everything and anything in music makes he and his band all the more absurd. He even claimed that Kiss were better than the Who live. Excuse me? In fact, I wouldn't have been surprised to hear him claim that Kiss invented the Who. And he should keep the makeup on all the time-he looks better with it on than without it."
1,that seattle band dude was totally rite,"Thank god for seatle bands they rok. They r so much more electric on stage thier lyrics hit home, AND HAVE MEANING.unlike kiss's sex fantasie lyrics."
1,The Most Overrated Music in Rock n' Roll History,"What's with the hype about KISS? They're not that great of a band. They're just a bunch of makeup wearing queers with mediocre skills. I don't even know why these clowns are considered rock legends. There are much better bands out there from their era, such as, AC/DC and Aerosmith. AC/DC and Aerosmith were great bands who didn't wear craploads of makeup. Get your heads out of your asses and stop listening to KISS."
4,good but........,"THIS HAS A GOOD COLLECTION OF SONGS BUT CAN YOU SAY THAT WE REALLY NEED ANOTHER IN THE LONG AND BORING LINE OF KISS BEST`OF.GET THIS CD IF YOUR REALLY BORED WITH YOUR LIFE AND IN NEED OF A GOOD KICK IN THE BUTT.OTHER WISE,LEAVE THIS REHASSED CD ALONE."
3,Universal's sad attempt to ca$h in...,"I love KISS, but Universal (KISS's old parent record label) is just issuing as many compilations as possible. Check out the number of comps in the '20th Century Masters' Series. Decent compilation of songs, nothing groundbreaking."
3,Explicit Lyrics?!! WTF?,"What are you people, nuns!? This is a Kiss collection, not Limp Bizkit or Lamb of God, there probably isn't even an a-word mentioned in any of these songs! Stop smoking the weed Amazon!Good collection, but there is too much 70's and not enough 80's or 90's. Feel greedy, Paul and Gene? Well then make a 2-disc greatest hits, one with their 70's through early 80's and the other with a compilation of their greatest post-Dynasty hits."
3,"PRETTY GOOD COMPILATION,BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER","THIS WAS NOT BAD, BUT NOT THE BEST KISS COMPILATION OF HITS.IF YOU WANTED THE BEST VERY BEST OF KISS,THIS WOULD BE IT.DEUCESTRUTTERHOTTER THAN HELLROCK AND ROLL ALL NIGHTCALLING DR.

1,Why bother?,"Yet another greatest hits package. It looks like Kiss are trying to set a record for number of times they can re-sell the same songs. The first 17 of 21 tracks date from before 1980! That should tell you something. If you really want ""the very best of KISS"", buy Alive. If that's not enough, get Alive II, or possibly Destroyer. Their live stuff is better than their studio stuff anyway. If you want a greatest studio package, get Double Platinum, it covers much of the same material but at least it's remixed a bit."
3,Another best of?,"One thing that was particularly exciting about being a Kiss fan,was the new albums and seeing how the new songs fit into the stage show.While there is some great songs here,how many more ""Best Of's"" do we get.If you have been a Kiss fan for as long as i have (1976),no doubt you would already have these songs.If you are a younger fan and dont have these songs,get it for sure because its great value for money.But for us older fans,we have heard it all before."
3,"5 Stars For The Music, 1 Star For The Greed...","Here's Kiss (aka Gene Simmons) following in Aerosmith's footsteps and running a close second in the ""Greatest"", ""Ultimate"", ""Best Of"", ""Essential"", ""Classic Hits"" sweepstakes. Didn't Kiss come out with a box set and an album called ""Greatest Kiss"" recently.Not to mention ""Double Platinum"", ""Smashes, Thrashes, & Hits"" & ""You Wanted The Best..."".You can not fault the music. The songs are imbedded in the hearts and souls of every kid who grew up with this band in the 70's. ""Ace Frehley, lead guitar!"" But the recycling of the music over and over is wearing thin. NO unreleased studio or live tracks, NO new music at all. ""If it wasn't for the fans we would be nothing"", Simmons always boasts. Well I am a Kiss fan, a Stones fan, an Aerosmith fan, a Skynyrd fan, a Tull fan, a Blue Oyster Cult fan, a Who fan etc...etc....and I ain't biting anymore. Excuse me while I go spin my vinyl copy of Alive I bought 30 years ago for under 5 bucks."
2,Mercy!!! Please no more Rock n Roll all Nite!!,"I'm sorry KISS fans, I can't take no more. Yes I am a KISS soldier in the KISS Army. In fact I have probably been promoted to Lieutenant General by now. But enough is enough already!Can you believe the promotional sticker on this album says 'Featuring Rock n Roll all Nite as heard on That 70's Show'? Run that by me again? Is there no end to this? Hey I love that song as much as the next KISS fan, but how many times do you have to purchase that song? Let's see.....1. Dressed to Kill2. Alive!3. Double Platinum4. Killers5. Smashes, Thrashes, and Hits6. The Kiss Box Set7. 20th Century Remasters8. ALIVE III9. ALIVE IV10. The Very Best of KISS11. KISS Greatest HitsI'm sure I missed one or two, but I've made my point. If you're a KISS fan, why bother buying this? No doubt in your CD collection you probably have every one of these songs at least three times over."
1,Give me a break!,Kiss have more compliation albums than I have had hot dinners. This is just a rehash of other compliation albums. Nothing new here. Double Platinum is far better
5,Decent Hits album,"Most people already have a couple of KISS compilations. Well then, don't buy another one. Wouldn't that make more sense then buying it and griping? You don't HAVE to buy it. For the rest of you out there, this is a good disc. It would make a great way to introduce someone to KISS. KISS RULES!..."
3,My idea of a BEST OF KISS C.D....,"My ""The Very Best of Kiss"" C.D would consist of the following songs:1.Creatures of the Night-""Creatures of the Night""2.Detriot Rock City-""Destroyer""3.Deuce (live)-""Alive 3""4.Lick it up-""Lick it up""5.Beth-""Destroyer""6.Killer-""Creatures of the Night""7.Love Gun-""Love Gun""8.I was made for lovin' you-""Dynasty""9.Rocket Ride-""Alive 2""10.Black Diamond-""Kiss""11.Shout it out loud-""Destroyer""12.I love it loud-""Creatures of the Night""13.King of the night time world-""Destroyer""14.Save your love-""Dynasty""15.Danger-""Creatures of the Night""16.Forever (live)-""Alive 3""17.Nothin' to loose (live)-""Alive!""18.Take me-""Rock and Roll Over""19.God gave rock and roll to you (live)-""Alive 3""20.Rock Bottom-""Dressed to kill""21.Rock and Roll all Night-""Dressed to Kill""*Bonus Track* Love Gun (live)-""Alive IV Symphony""That would be a Kick@$& compilation. I dare you say that you don't agree."
2,Just As Good As You Remember It Being.,"I didn't really get the whole KISS thing the first time around, even though I happened to be smack dab in the middle of their target audience. So I bought this thinking maybe I was being too much of a musical snob back then.I wasn't.With a few notable exceptions like ""Beth"" and ""Rock & Roll All Nite"", these songs could've easily been taken from the soundtracks to great R-rated classics like Hollywood Hot Tubs or Hot Dog.Thin Lizzy, Grand Funk, Bad Company, even Ted Nugent or Bachman Turner Overweight still seem to have more to offer if you're looking for a way to musically relive the 1970s.But man, they still look really cool."
1,"Unmasked, Animalize, Asylum, Crazy nights, PC¿Donde estaís?","Este grandes éxitos tiene el problema del bloque del grupo, por lo que se han dedicado ha introducir canciones de la época en la formaban los cuatro componentes originales, como consecuencia se han sobrepasado con los discos ""Kiss"", ""Hotter than hell"", ""Love gun"" y ""Rock'n roll over"".Si dijeras que los cinco discos olvidados no contenian ninguna obra a resaltar sería comprensible la actitud del recopilatoria, pero se han dejado atras de forma imperdonable, la mejor balada del grupo y una de las mejores de todos los tiempos ""Reason to live"". Si se continua por ese camino, uno se pone las botas: del Unmasked ""Shandi"" por ejemplo, del Animalize ""Heaven`s on fire"" otra ausencia imperdonable, del Asylum ""Uh, all night"", del Crazy Nights la mencionada anteriormente o ""I'll fight hell to hold"", y del Psycho Circus el golpe metal del mismo nombre o ""Within"" o ""Dreamin""."
2,Why?,"Kiss have a split personality. On the one hand, they have garish, theatrical makeup, lots of fire, and names like Demon and... Catboy or something. But when they start playing, you expect a noise similar to KMFDM or Alice Cooper... not Def Leppard.How, and dear god why, have Kiss been going on so long? Their music isn't remotely original, even if thier stage antics are, and not nearly rocky enough to make them the Kings of Rock or whatever the hell they have a reputation for. I think rock and I think the Stones, I think classic Metallica, I think Led Zeppelin."
3,How many best of albums does one band need?,"This is a good album with a lot of classic cuts but I do believe I have seen this album before. Maybe, I think it was called Double Platinum. That album and several other called 'best of' I have sampled. Obviously there are people buying these things but I won't count myself among their number, at least not anymore. Two 'best of' albums is enough for me to own, thank you very much. Good day to you."
5,The very best of KISS!,"This album is great, not the best, but none the less a KISS album. This albums tells the best from one of the hottest band ever: KISS. I think this album didn't have enough songs from KISS, for example: Nothin'To Lose, Mainline, Let Me Go Rock 'n Roll, Let Me know, Radioactive, Great Expectations, Flaming Youth, Nothing Can Keep Me From You, Rip It Out, Ozone, Two Sides Of The Coin and TONS MORE!This album contains only the very best of KISS, no new songs or interviwes. But if you want to know what was the best of KISS's songs, buy this album and belive me: IT IS THE VERY, VERY BEST FROM THE HOTTEST BAND IN THE WORLD, KISS!!!!!!!"
4,A very good compilation,"KISS has had a number of ""Best Of"" and ""Greatest Hits"" CDs, but this one is the best. It does have a few problems though.1 It tends to focus on Paul Stanley more then any of the others. Stanley wrote some of best KISS songs, but some on this CD are not that substantial. Gene Simmons ""Goin Blind"" sould be there insted of ""Got to Choose"".2 Ace Frehley is almost completley ignored. There are none of his KISS songs, only ""New York Groove"", a very good song, but if you are going to include songs from the solo albums there sould be one from each. ""Cold Gin"" should be there insted. Although I don't like ""Shock Me"" it was a interesting chapter in KISS history. It was Frehley's first lead vocal, and should be there insted of Stanley's ""I stole your love"".3 ""Dynasty 1979"" is underated album. One more song from it would have been nice(altough ""I was made for lovin' you"" is the best). That all being said, it is still the best KISS compilation out there."
2,Enough Is Enough!,"What is it with Kiss and greatest hits packages? Don't Gene and Paul have enough money already? Or is it that they don't have enough talent anymore to write any new, decent songs?If you are any kind of Kiss fan then you already have all of these songs on 10 other best of CDs. If you are not a Kiss fan, and don't have any of these songs then where in the hell have you been hiding? Please guys. Enough with these greatest hits releases! Put out some new, good material or go straight to the retirement home!"
1,"""Mo money mo money...""","For Gene Simmon's probably numerous illegitimate children. Don't buy it, buy Alive I and II and you have the ""best of the best""! (The very best of KI$$)"
5,An Amazing Collection,"This is one of the most amazing collections of songs I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. I highly reccomend it to all music fans, KISS fan or not. I give this CD a 10/10. Truly a great collection."
3,Good compilation but not the very best,"This CD features SOME of the best Kiss songs but certainly not the VERY best. Most fans already have CD's like Smashes Thrashes and Hits as well as other ""Best of"" or ""Greatest Hits"" compilations from this band. Heck they probably own ALL the KISS CD's."
4,Kinda The Best,Somehow this greatest hits CD isn't complete. This band has had somany great songs over the years and alot have been left out of thisCD. If you really want all of kiss's best buy the kiss box set.Of course if you don't want to spend alot then buy this CD.
3,What??,"Sure this cd has a lot of their good hits, but it's missing tears are falling, unholy, domino, and I pledge allegence to the state of rock and roll."
3,Very Best of ? I don't think so.,"This cd is ALMOST the Very best of KISS. below is a list of songs that should have been on the cd, but weren't.By the way, for all u people who are saying KISS did this to make money, this cd wasn't even KISS's idea, it was their record company's.1)Nothin'to Lose,2)Watchin' You,3)She,4)Shock Me,5)Sure know something,6)A World Without Heros,7)Creatures of the Night,8)Heaven's on Fire,9)Tears are Falling,10)Crazy Nights,11)Domino,12)Every time I look at you, and 13) Psycho Circus. If they had included these songs also MAYBE just MAYBE I would have bought it."
1,HOW MANY HITS DO YOU THEY THINK THEY HAVE?,"THINK..... ROCK AND ROLL ALL NITE HAS NOW MADE IT ON TO 10 DIFFERENT ALBUMS. IS IT REALLY THAT GOOD OF A SONG? THE BAND MUST HAVE A CONTRACT TO FILL, BECAUSE THIS NOW GIVES THEM A TOTAL OF 10 GREATEST HITS/LIVE ALBUMS. TWO WORDS; NEW MATERIAL.TWO MORE WORDS; ACE FREHLEY. AT LEAST GENE AND PAUL WERE SMART ENOUGH TO PUT PETER AND ACE ON THE COVER, OR IS THAT ERIC SINGER AND TOMMY THAYER?. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND FIND A REAL GREATEST HITS, SUCH AS; KILLERS,DOUBLE PLATINUM,SMASHES THARASHES & HITS, UNPLUGGED, GREATEST KISS, KISS ALIVE I-IV, OR THAT SILLY BOX SET. GET THE IDEA!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Please, retire and stick with the old ALIVE recordings","I was a big Kiss fan as a teenager and had the ALIVE in vinyl. With the title, ""BEST"" I was expecting some of the golden oldies and instead was tortured with some very poor studio recordings that sounded so mechanical I had to take the CD out of the player after a few songs and almost gave it a fling! There is no passion in this music at all and it sounds like a bunch of robot musicians going through the songbook. Very poor. There might be some better tracks later on but I couldn't take the punishment to get there. Very dissapointed!"
3,uh helooooooooooo,"dawnnnnnnnnnnnnnn come on it doesnt have ""REASON TO LIVE"",,,for some reason they never seem to come out with the best of the artist, its ashame to miss out on a powerful song ,since im a big big fan of power ballads and hair metal,some other great songs weren't here either. anyways next to ""FOREVER"" as well as others kiss best songs always were the ballads."
3,others have said this but i wanna say it anyway.,"first off, i didn't buy this album. im sure it is a decent compilation. but my point is tht kiss have made maybe 12 greatest hits albums. another thing is that kiss is the most comercial band ever to be formed (you can buy a coffin with them on it!). they obviously just wanna rip off fans anyway they can. the only reason to buy this is if you don't know kiss to much yet, or you are a brain washed kiss zombie who will buy anything with their name on it."
1,I hope Gene Simmons Read's this...,"First of all, i LOVE this CD. I LOVE Kiss. I mean all of the songs on here simply RULE! But why ONE star? Because of the marketing ... Gene Simmons. No longer is he the demonic and charismatic i once looked up too, now he is just a greedy double chinned loser. Ace Frehley is an example of a musician with a heart. That dude man, he wails on his guitar because he LIKES to. He does what he loves, and thats music. I am getting the feeling that Gene Simmons does what he loves, money. He doesnt do it for the fans or ""by to people for the people"". this CD was all intentional a corprate CD, sold ONLY for money, and had nothing to do with them having a good time in the studio doing what they love. KISS is a great band, i own every CD - they are my FAVORITE. all the memebers are swell guys, except gene. Man why cant an old school rock and roll fan get some decent deals around here?....."
2,"Line up and bend over, here it comes again","How much money will it take before Gene and Paul are satisfied? ""Greatest Kiss"", ""You Wanted The Best, You Got The Best"", ""Double Platinum"", ""Alive 1,2,3..."", ""Double Platimum"", the box set. Maybe you need this album if you've never heard Kiss before (yes, you 100 year old Australian Aborigine, I'm talking to you) but most everybody else should have had enough of the ""best of"" by now to last for the rest of their lives. This album? I'm skipping it and I think you should to. Of course, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong."
1,A box set followed up by greatest hits = more $$$!,"Really, this has gotten out of control. I am an avid KISS fan but I am still digusted by the way this band just (draws) money from it's fans. Sure, they chalk it up to being something that only the record company controls (releasing this album). However, nothing keeps the band from cashing the royalty checks.KISS fans - stay away from this one unless you really need yet another reason to have all the same songs under a new package.If you do not own any KISS albums - you could start with this one. However, Double Platinum or Greatest KISS would be just fine too."
2,"Yikes, enough already!","Good God, Kiss has more ""best of"" albums than studio ones! What Kiss fan on earth would have any need to buy this CD? They released a massive box set just a few years ago, for crying out loud. I'm a Kiss fan, it'd be great to own every Kiss album for the sake of having the complete catalouge, but I mean come on already. They're not just beating the dead horse now, they're holding it by the hind legs and thrashing the carcass back and forth into a pulp. If you want to milk the last of the diehards a little more at least throw them something they don't already have, if there's even a scrap remaining, that is."
1,Compilation after compilation...,"Go to the Studio once in a while for Pete's sake. Did I see someone say ""good girl gone bad"" should be on a compilation? That song should even be played again let alone re-released."
4,Ease up!,"Yeah - it's another greatest hits collection by KISS even though there's already one out there for every day of the week. Everyone is baggin' on this like it's just a ditch effort to make more money. Sure they'll make money on this but it's NOT the band's choice to put this out -it's THE RECORD COMPANY'S! KISS is no longer with this lable and, as part of their (old) contract, the label gets to do this kind of thing even though the band does NOT want to put out another GH package. Since the label was going to do it anyway - the band put their two cents in (!!) so what if they get more than two cents out of it... KISS always was about makin' money!If you already own this music go listen to your other KISS CDs and stop complaining. If you don't own any KISS CDs then here's an excellent collection for you - turn it up, rock out and forget about the money - yours or theirs. The music is great, that's what really matters..."
4,Overkill Works,"Yes I am a KISS fan. So , any new KISS item is a must buy. However, given that compilations like this one are available, why are there so many ""Best ofs"" under the rubric of KISS available ??Gene never has enough cash, but surely he could write some more KISS tunes??? It is not like someone with the remastered items could not put their own disc together.It's about time that Gene and Paul ( the remnant of KISS ), start to push out the originals visual shows, and stop the plethora of compilations."
2,Yawn,Have loved KISS since 1978. Am over yet another Greatest Hits package. Just how many albums have Rock and Roll All Nite on them??
2,"I just didn't get ""into"" it","This book entails a lot of highly politically charged post-colonial science fiction. It felt a lot like reading a poetry from an annual collection for people interested in post-colonial literature. The works in this book are more serious, mature, and anchored in the real world than most traditional science fiction. If your a fan of most western science fiction, brace yourself for a very different style. It wasn't my cup of tea - again too political for me."
3,totally cool but not as good as the other books,"i love this book, but it doesnt compare to the other Help!s. ok, so the insults exchanged at the beggining of the book were lame. 'your brother's so stupid he sat on the tv and watched the couch.' 'you're so uncoordinated you slept on the floor and still fell out of bed' uh huh. i also thought the whole 'let's be nice to each other' was kind of corny too. BUT i love the whole thing where Jake is trapped in Scarcely Hers, a major girly store, and he's obsessing about Girl Rays that he thinks are gonna stunt his growth, take away his manhood[no i dont mean it like that, sicko!], and scar him for life. that was again, lame, but very cute. and GEEZ, why'd he have to CRY at the end? being a girl isn't that bad! but the funniest parts were when Jake was bad-mouthing Jessica's boyfriend, Dan Winters, a flirt with bad acne."
2,"Pleasant, but not real mariachi music","Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan is the most important group in the history of the genre. Their recordings from the 1940's through the '60's, both alone and in support of great Ranchera stars, are treasures of Mexican music history. While the ensemble remains one of the best for theater performances, this recording doesn't feature a single *real* mariachi piece, nor any compositions in authentic regional *son* style. It's pretty, but it's not real mariachi music. If you would prefer something with more roots sensibilities, buy older Vargas CDs, or anything by Mariachi Cobre."
2,Not Worthy Of....,"This book is not worthy of the ""Unleashed"" series, which typically has stellar books. Mostly just marketing level advice with very little in-depth information. You can get more information out of a Google search."
1,Awful Book,"When I first started working my current job, I was given this book. I have to say that this is an extremely boring book. It didn't engage me in any shape, form, or fashion. Learning SharePoint is already difficult and this book does not make it any easier. I am glad I didn't buy it."
4,Good reference book,"This is a good book and as a reference guide, it's great. I do feel that the editing could be better, it is easy to spot that different authors worked on this book. If the diting had been better and the very trivial first few chapters had been shortened somehwat I would have given this book a 5 star rating."
2,Project driven instead of learning or reference book,"The authors take a project management approach to SharePoint. The book takes you through all the steps necessary when starting a new SharePoint system. My issue with this approach is that unless you have a reasonable understanding of SharePoint first, it's difficult to grasp the concepts they are explaining.This would be a good book as a guide to creating a SharePoint system from scratch but you'll be better off getting another book to actually learn the software first."
2,Takes you half way there--not the whole way,"(actual review is 2.5 stars). Even though this book has a lot of pages, the content is pretty shallow and it suffers from an apparent desire to address to many different types of reader, from the developer to the administrator, to the technology decision maker. The result is that the book is weak in two key areas: development and administration. For readers who want reasonable depth in those areas, I suggest finding another source. For readers who want a broad brush, the book is a fine work."
3,Metal rope is ok,I put this onto my dining room hutch in case of an earthquake. It's hard to know if the whole back end of the hutch would just give way if there was violent shaking or if it would just create a hole in the back of the hutch with the rest of the hutch flying forward. It's such a small area that is used to hold onto. I think I am going to reinforce with some L brackets on the top of the hutch to the wall. That would more likely hold.
2,How big a vacation home do you want?,"I was dissapointed with this book, from a title standpoint. ""Vacation homes"" are not how I would categorize the plans in this book - although there are some nice plans. I would consider almost all 500 of them to be regular home plans - there certainly wasn't much available here that was less than 1200 sq ft. Not quite the cozy lakeside cottage I was looking for!"
5,High Value at a Very Low Cost,This a comprehensive collection with a very low cost. This is a serious addition to a serious library.
2,"Complete, Yes. Useful, not really.","This product is indeed what it advertises. The works (journals, letters, sermons and comments) of John Wesley on CD. The problem is that it is all one long text file. It is trapped inside the Folio Infobase software that was out of date 10 years ago. You can export the entire text to either WordPerfect or RTF (no PDF or MS Word option) but even then all 7 (or 14) volumes are contained in one giant file. You can search for particular words, but I haven't found any topical search (ie - I want a sermon on sanctification). And the worst for any $50 product, there are misspellings in the text!! I wish I had bought the 7 book hardcover edition so at least it would look pretty on my shelf. This just isn't going to be as useful as I had hoped."
4,definitely worth reading,"this is a good read because mukpo doesn't try to convince anyone, including herself, of anything. she tells her story as it happened and is happening, willingly opening herself to possible criticism and raised eyebrows. this is a real life, a real marriage, not, as her husband said, ""one of those suburban couples"" who pretend everything is real when it isn't. trungpa may have had some issues, but he profoundly impacted many lives. whether his impact was positive or negative is irrelevant--buddhism does not judge."
5,intimate life of turngpa,"I very much agree with the previous two reviews. This is a wonderfuuly intimate and candid report of life with Trungpa. One hears about his outrageous teaching ""methods"" and starts to see in this book that while some of the ""crazy"" methods were based on the desire to awaken his students, it is very possible that others were just based on too much alcohol. So even though he was not perfect, one also sees how very difficult his life was and how much he had to change from Tibetan culture to American hippie culture to get his teaching about Buddhism across. One also admires her struggle to provide some stability to both their lives. This book along with the recently published biography of Trungpa provides an opportunity to see his overall teachings twenty years later."
2,It's ok...,"Picture quality is ok, nothing spectacular. DVD features and usability is pretty substandard; less features than a fischer price toy. The real let-down with this lcd is the audio. The speakers are just horrendous. The sound quality is poor, and doesnt carry very well. What made me laugh at this unit was the included digital audio out. 15"" LCD...with a digital audio out and no rca stereo jacks. There is a headpone minijack, although its cheap and easily introduces static into whatever it is feeding. All in all, a pretty poorly designed and executed product. When you look at the price in relation to the features, and add to this the poor audio and average video performance...it isnt any wonder why there are no Toshiba products in my home. Cheap hardware for an exorberant price."
4,Just got it,"Seems ok. Volume is a little low for me, but the picture is nice. We only got it to watch videos for work and some do it yourself videos. We think only bored or stupid people watch TV."
2,POOR SOUND,"I HAVE ALREADY SENT THE T.V. BACK TO TOSHIBA TO HAVE THE VOLUMN REPAIRED, THE T.V IS IN THE KITCHEN AND YOU CANNOT HEAR IT AT MAX. VOLUMN 5 FEET AWAY. AFTER BEING REPAIRED?????, ITS NO BETTER"
5,"Toshiba 15DLV76 15"" LCD TV/DVD","This has been an excellent choice for a tv for the kitchen. Out of the box, set up was easy and ready to go. Good picture and dvd works well."
2,Not for experienced runners,"The book is interesting, and well written. It contains little unique or scarcely known or understood information. Novice runners might like it and get more from it than experienced runners."
3,"OK, but more interesting then the movie","First of all, everyone told me the movie would be bad, so I bought lots of snacks, but I ended up quite liking it, considering my only motive for seeing it was Ben Affleck and Casey Affleck, who got less screen time then he should have. . . Anyway, the book was only good 'cause I liked the movie, and the book had new info about the characters that made them a bit more exciting then the movie did. Overall, only read this if you missed the movie or liked the movie."
2,Not all that great...,"I finished this in one day. It is that easy a read. Its got a virtually non-existant plot. The characters are also rather flat and unrealistic. It does try to have some humour here and there, but that's about it. It's not worth the time spent reading it, unless you happen to be doing a book report on something sucky. After I read this, I doubt I'll go watch the movie, even though the movie has a great cast. Overall, a disappointment."
2,Somewhat disappointing...,"Honestly, I was expecting more. These ""dummies"" books give the authors almost unlimited opportunity to explain something in detail, yet make it interesting and enlightening. What I would have wanted to see was more history on the story of Siddhartha and how he became Buddha. I also thought the book was biased toward the Tibet way of Buddhism and those looking for more about Zen are going to be disappointed. The book almost reads like a college textbook and that is just dry dry dry. Yuck."
3,For dummies...,"This book constantly refers to other parts of the book in parenthesis, it is extremely distracting. Very hard to understand the point when you have (For more information on ### refer to page #.) every other sentence."
4,Good but not for beginners,"This is no doubt a well written book. But because it combines too many practices and beliefs from different schools of thought it may be confusing for beginners. A better book for beginners, and one I highly recommend is, 'A Buddhism Primer - An Introduction to Buddhism'. This not only lays out the basics, but introduces every school of thought within Buddhism."
2,a bit loopy,"A little obscure, evasive, vague. The author talks about not fearing death but infers that there is a life after death. 'Hurry Up and Meditate' more real and useful, about to read 'What he Buddha Thought', hopefully this is more honest."
2,dull reading,"I thought the writing was dull and mostly from a historial informationial point of view. The information was boring, and I did not retain much at all. At best the book could be used for refrence only. Much like reading a dictionary. If your desperate for reading, put it in your bathroom and take a peek every now and again."
4,Simple learning about Buddism,"This was very informative. For a non serious book it gave a very good insight to Buddism. I would like to read more about the various styles of meditation part of it, without all the history"
4,Great for beginners,This was a great book for beginners. It gave me a good overview and understanding of Buddhism. This is definitely the book to start with if you have little to no knowledge of the subject.
3,Clear and simple,Concise explanation of a complex and confusing topic. An excellent introduction .Recommended as an initial primer where a reader has no previous knowledge.
4,The silence of the Buddha is golden,"I trust the authors of this book, and have great esteem for this addition to the teachings of the Buddha. My only 'criticism' is that the book seems weighted towards the practice of the authors, rather than survey what all Buddhists believe. But -- the truth is everywhere."
5,Just the facts...,"If you are not looking for a deep spiritual experience and are looking for facts and history, then this is the book for you. I use it as a reference guide, and when I am confused about an idea. I will always have a purpose for it, and would recommend this book to anyone new to buddhism."
4,A great read!,"This is a great boook to read on a rainly afternoon. I am one of LaVyrle's greatest fans, but this is not my favorite romance. Although the characters were totally believable, I thought the ending was a little rushed.We all know LaVryle retired, and her talent is greatly missed. Of all the romances, it was always LaVryle's books that I reached for first."
5,One of my Favorites,"This book is not about A woman with breasts issues that is call sweet memories,I know because I have also read all of her books two or three time and still find them exciting, and it's not just about her breasts it about find yourself, and falling in love for the frist time. It is one of my favorties, as well as A promise to cherish... This is a wonderful book,I totally fell for Sam. He was there for her, even when she felt the need to keep her family secrets, that's the part I just don't get... I have reread this book about 5 times, and still don't get why she felt the need to keep her kids as A secret. Oh well. Give this book A try, it was wonderful.."
1,uck,"i have read all of her books and have to say this was very disappointing. poor, poor girl with large breasts. I could have gagged. No intersting story, no interesting characters. Boring. Lets have another Bittersweet please. I wonder what happend to Maggie and Eric and Nancy."
3,Something lacking?,Generally I found this book a very good read. I just felt at the end the reader is left hanging. As anothers have mentioned the book maybe just too short to develop the plot fully.
4,My favorite author,It is so hard to find books by Laverle Spencer and I found this one for a penny! Can't wait to start reading it.
4,A little gem,"I bought this exact model and color about 2 years and I have to say I am quite pleased with it. For the price I think these Pacifica's are excellent starter guitars. The quality of build is very good, the pick-ups are decent and it looks great. It has a very versatile sound with the HSS setup and the only problem I have with the guitar is a little bit of fret-buzz on the 3rd string. Given how much I play A chords this is an annoyance but that is the only complaint I have with this guitar and it's fixable quite easily so it's no biggie. Over-all, I prefer this guitar to any of the more expensive guitars thay I have played (though I have yet to play an AU$1000+ guitar such as a Fender or Gibson) and I doubt I will ever get rid of it"
3,Lacking an important bit of information,"This is a beautiful book full of cute baby blankets. But though it claims to have projects ""from easy to advanced"" I can find nowhere that lists which are which. I am a beginning crocheter and I'm sure that if I were more advanced I could tell which projects would be easy. But as it stands now I wish I could tell before I invest in the yarn and start a project. If anyone knows how to get this information, please post.Becky"
5,GREAT BUY!!!!,Item was prompt with delivery and came in good condition.My fiance loves this book and says it's very easy to understand and follow.I would recommend this to anyone getting involved in Crochet.I would buy from this vendor again with pleasure.
2,Not unless you need it...,"For the most part, this book is unreadable and uninspiring. The abridged editions are not much better. It was highly influential in its time, so it's standard reading for history-of-philosophy courses. This is one of several excellent reasons why you shouldn't take history of philosophy courses.For the voluntary reader, the fact that Locke was highly influential also means that his ideas have been developed into something clearer and more interesting by the intervening generations. Read Hume or a 20th-cent. empiricist instead."
1,An Essay Concerning Human Meandering,Not just simple ideas in this one but stupid ones too. No one should ever read this colossal waste of time unless by reading you mean beating yourself unmercifully on the face and head until death occurs.
2,Bad binding: Not sure if fluke or normal,"The book is great, it's exactly what I need for a class I'm taking on Modern Philosophy. It appears to be an unabridged edition of Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding. It's clear and understandable as printed. The only compaint I have is that simply opening this book to read it split the cover away from the pages. The book is effectively coming unravelled. I have other books from the Prometheus lineup which have no such problem, however, they are all relatively short books of less than 150 pages. This one is over 600 pages and from what I can tell it appears that the binding just isn't up to task for the amount of pages in the book. I'm not sure if this is just a fluke or not. But to Amazon's credit they refunded me the price of the book. I'm very glad I ordered an Amazon.com product due to the excellent customer service I received and feel very safe in future purchases from Amazon."
5,A strong work throughout,A searing book of poems. Honest and rigorous with a sensibility serene enough to listen to the shadows hovering below the surface of words.A stunning collection. A minor triumph of integrity and grace.
3,Counter sinks,I have already drilled a bunch of holes with this set. Chucks up fast and is easily adjustable. Nice index also.
3,"Not Repairman Jack, but it is F. Paul Wilson","As a Repairman Jack fan, I love F. Paul Wilson's writing. I enjoyed this book but it won't ever be a favorite. It has a religious theme that may or may not make some people happy but it is definitely thought provoking. I have never read a book by him that wasn't worth reading, this just isn't my favorite. It's kind of a Sci-Fi other world story and they are not my cup of tea but again, it's F. Paul Wilson."
5,PLEASED,This is a wonderful little memoir which moves one to deeperself knowledge and offers steps toward continued growth withthe reflection questions at the end of the book. I have orderedmany copies and have given them to family and friends.
5,Royal Book of Ballett,I remembered this from my childhood. Beautifully illustrated with a good summary of each ballet - it brought back many happy memories!
5,Just the tip of the hippo,This book is common sense in an industry of uncommon confusion. Among many other useful insights the book sheds light on the legacy of international agencies whose neglect of domestic cultures and conventions have led to many campaign failures. This is a must read for any marketing head who has to manage agencies especially if your company is in multiple countries! Read this book before you go ahead with your next campaign.
5,international enlightenment,"Vincent Toolan misses the point. What is the alternative to being passionate about relevant cultural messages, and where exactly is Anholt going wrong in establishing top international teams to deliver them? The arrogance and lack of comprehension portrayed in many international campaigns is alarming, and Anholt's efforts to identify and illuminate cultural and linguistic differences makes great reading."
5,Another One Bites the Grass: Making Sense of International A,"A wake-up call to the global ad industry.This is a smart, funny, pomposity-lite examination of the ad industry's most serious problem. International advertising is where it's at, yet most of the world's big ad guys keep getting it wrong.Mr. Anholt has spoken the unspeakable truth about today's agency networks."
4,Simon Has It Right,"Simon Anholt is one of the more brilliant, if volable people I ever met during my 30 years in advertising. About a year ago, we spent a long evening in London exploring his theories of global marketing. Among his tsunami of words were a clutch of conceptual crystaline gems. The words are transient; the concepts will stay with me forever.Global brands will rise and die on how well their shepherds understand the difference between language and culture. Simon definitely knows: you might not. And there aren't many global brands worth less than the cost of this book."
5,Another One Bites The Grass,"Still too many people in the communication business don't understand the real meaning of the word ""culture"". Culture is never a level, a standard, a trend, but a paradox mixture of personality + social articulation. You can exchange (""translate"") quantities, but not values. This basic concept was expressed powerfully by Oscar Wilde (and I like to tell it an idiom that is quite far away from Irish): ""Il cinico è colui che conosce il prezzo di tutto e il valore di nulla"". Simon Anholt is sort of a Gianluca Vialli in advertising: the modern Champions League in advertising has many playgrounds, climates, referees - and that's why his international team wins a lot. Simon Anholt's coaching isn't abstract because he likes to play himself. That's why he is such a good storyteller. No fiction, real plots."
3,A low-budget tribute,"This video is a collection of footages of J. du Pre put together in a tape and mixed with comments by Pleeth. Why only Pleeth? Apparently because they didn't have the money to travel outside of England to interview other people. Also, they didn't seem to have the money to pay for a good text to go with it. Still, it has some interesting footage and is worth watching. I particularly like the scene where they swap their instruments and du Pre plays the violin in a cello like way."
2,Retrograde,"I am sure there are worthy artistic goals in this movie. May have even been attained. Yet, the shock of sitting through more than an hour of trivial Americana in 2012, when there are challenges requiring real depth, is profoundly unhelpful. I would rather see Diane Lane in that Neaderthal Nights movie which makes no pretense, where I can zone out and get refreshed.Death and Resurrection of a Superpower"
1,Ineffective product,The product was ordered for my mom who has arthritis in her knees. She used the product until the tube was finished. The product did not work at all. She was very disappointed as was I. I would not recommend this product.
3,Not as funny as the first season,"The humor in this one is often quite poor. The last episode may be the best one, but overall the jokes are silly and boring most of the time. The first season was much better, haven't seen the later ones yet. Rowan Atkinson does a good job of acting though."
3,Bird,"I love the black Adder, but this DVD does not have all the episodes for the black Adder 2 series, and is incomplete. So now I have to buy another DVD."
5,Wonderful Book,"I sent this book as a gift and it was very much enjoyed.. This is a well written,funny book. you won't be sorry you bought it."
5,Life's too short,We used this for an adult Sunday School class. It lent itself well with no homework and lots of room for discussion. It was in no way heavy--perfect for a summer class.
2,Where's the rest of the show...?,"An hour long network show without commercials from this time period would run about 49-52 minutes. This is DVD is 35. Where is the rest of the show? Buyers will obviously think these are complete episodes as found on the Sonny & Cher Show DVD collection and they are not, just chopped up bits of shows. You get ripped off...Merry Christmas!"
4,Love Star Trek,"I enjoy reading new versions of Star Trek. New Frontiers has interesting characters, especial the captain. Helps the adventure continue."
5,Excellent story.,"Like all the books in this series, it won't stand alone; if you haven't read what went before it, the beginning will seem rather confusing. But at least it (mostly) actually has an ending, which is rare for books in this series. (There is a teaser for the beginning of the next book's plot, but no major plotline left unsettled.) I suppose if I must choose between a book with no beginning and a book with no ending, I'll settle for one with no beginning, and this book is the finale to one of the best stories in this admittedly very good series."
4,Good product despite imperfections,"I was often looking for a game that enhances my desire to be a cop. With plenty of action, lots of missions, and an adequate complexity level, this game really delivers. Of course, the graphics can't compete with the PS2, but they are still good enough to boggle the mind. The siren is realistic and the buildings are different enough to prevent boredom. The commentary by the narrator and the radio transmissions really add to this cheesy game.Detracting from the game are the sluggish popups, and a single sound for a variety of vehicles. However, these are slight imperfections when considering the overall play.Although the game is ""T"" rated, I still play the ""Free Patrol"" with my 4 year old son. We just avoid the shooting at all costs."
1,Awful AWFUL,"I bought this game for like $ because i read these reviews on amazon so i thought it would be alright since alot of people liked it. When i played it... i regreted even thinking of buying it. It has horrible controls, stupid missions, and the graphics are so bad, the pics cant give you any idea how bad the graphics are. I returned this game and got my money back because it was so bad after playing less then 1 hour."
5,World's funnest game,"This review is meant to focus on how very cool this game is.High speed action in a police car is probably the best thing you have ever seen.Working lights and a up-to-date sounding siren on any of your police crusiers, it is dream land for everbody.From Crown Victoria's to all purpose Jetta wagon's, it is awesome.Plus it is as realistic of the real streets in Albany,NY.have fun playing this brialliant game!!!"
5,WOW --- WHAT A GAME,this is a great game. Take the law into your own hands and catch criminals. Once you have wrecked their car -- get out of your car and exchange gunfire with the criminal . Do what ever you have to do to take the Criminal down.BUY THIS GAME
3,Disappointed Mom with Thrilled Little Ones,"In an effort to be frugal, and not spend $25 on a real pair of ruby red shoes for my growing toddlers, I decided to give these a try. Needless to say, I was quite disappointed, but my girls were thrilled with their new little ""shoes"". The concept of the shoe cover is great since my kids can become Dorothy from Wizard of Oz whenever with just the snap of the velcro cover around their shoe, but the quality is another issue. A bow has already come off one of the slippers. Also, the cost of shipping was as much as the shoe cover itself. Unfortunately, after the purchase of two shoe covers and shipping, I probably should have just purchased the shoes themselves."
2,"Good idea, poor quality.","Shoe covers were a great idea I thought, however after my daughter put them on one of the bows fell off within 15 minutes. They also did not stay on her shoes very well, they kept slipping off. They were cute when they were put on unfortunately they just wouldn't stay on."
2,Disappointed,I just received these a few minutes ago and was very excited to try them. I tried to put them on 2 different pairs of my daughters shoes and they do not fit. My daughter is 5 and wears a size 12-13 shoe. The package says 4+ but I think it should say 4 and under. Also one of them is flawed from being stretched over the insert that was in it. I guess I will see about returning.
3,thankyou,"i was happy to recieve this item on time, just didint work out for my girls halloween costume, not what i was expecting."
2,Too small and cheaply made,"These were described as fitting ""most children's shoes"" but they were too small for anything but the smallest child's shoes. They were also cheaply made and very thin."
3,Too small,The shoe covers seemed okay for limited use. The may haved worked well for a couple of wears around Halloween. But they were way too small for my four year old.
2,Too small and junky,My daughter has size 12 feet and these covers were nowhere near big enough to work. More like size 7
1,Not Satisfied,"I understood theseRuby Slippers Shoe Covers (Child)were a shoe cover, and not a slip on slipper-type shoe, but the item is a big disappointment. First, when I first opened the package, a ton of the red shiney sequins had already fallen off and were floating all over the bag. Not a great way to start off. And although I did read the shoes were a ""shoe cover"", I thought perhaps (partly based on the picture) that there was a ""bottom"" to the shoe... not just an elastic cord, which for my daughter, could be come an obstacle while walking - she's 3 and pretty stable on her feet, but walking ON an elastic cord is somewhat awkward . Also, the back of the shoe has a velcro portion, which I'm not sure why, considering the shoe is not adjustable, but it was poorly made, doesn't lay flat, and ""pokes"" her when she walks. I know, you get what you pay for, but don't pay for this!"
3,Not the best quality,"Even though they were not the best quality, they worked! They are cheaper than searching for a pair of red shoes probably never worn again."
2,Ruby Slippers Shoe Covers,I was very unhappy with my purchase! I wanted to give the reviews the benefit of the doubt; I should have went with the majority! My two granddaughters and I had a Oz paarty and the shoe covers were off within the first 15 minutes! I agree with the shopper who said to save your money and invest in your little girl a nice pair of red shoes that she will get to wear for more than just a few minutes! Not worth the money! :(
1,ruby slipper shoe covers.,"This is really for an adult! I thought it was for a child. Unfortunately I couldn't use these, I would not recommend these. waste of money."
1,"Not Even a Full Booty, Horrible Quality!!!!","These are so awful. I guess that is what I get for four dollars. They are not even a full booty, they are bottomless. Yeah, try wrapping a bottomless, thin, crappy piece of material around a bouncy toddler's shoe and see how long it stays on there. Clue: It doesn't! The sequins fall off, the bows are not even centered over the toe, not well made. I ended up spending the fifteen dollars at a local store to buy 'real' ruby slippers, and we are so glad we did. Don't think you'll get away with saving the money, because you'll just end up buying the real slippers just like me!"
2,Formulative,"That's actually more of a 2.5 than a 2, but compared to XTC's later work, or even their next album, it's really mediocre. ""Statue Of Liberty"" and ""Radios In Motion"" are excellent songs, as are ""Science Friction"" and ""She's So Square,"" both included as bonus tracks, but there isn't much else to grab hold on here. Most of it's just generic quirk-pop (especially Colin Moulding's songs) and there's an endless, almost melodiless cover of ""All Along The Watchtower"" included as well. I'm not gonna say ""But it's better than 90% of recordings today! "" like all other fans because it's not. But the band got better really, REALLY quickly after this one-- they just hadn't pulled themselves together yet."
3,Two Tristanoites reunited,"This album reunites Konitz with the pianist Sal Mosca. Mosca is a puritan in terms of his playing: its adherence to Tristano's idiom is absolute; Konitz, on the other hand, had long since left behind his early style of playing, & here, while he touches on it, his sound is often pungent (close to Anthony Braxton in spots), his lines canny & unorthodox. Half of the album is duets with Mosca; the other half has the rhythm section of Ron Carter and Mousie Alexander.Hard to know what to say about this album: it's of course like anything of Konitz's worth the closest attention. I'm rather less enamoured of Mosca here: first, because the piano he's been given is pretty ugly-sounding (did they _tune_ it before the session?); secondly because he often tends to sound simply dour where Tristano himself would be electrifying.Certainly worth a listen; maybe not quite as remarkable as the personnel listing might suggest."
2,"What a drag, man","I have to throw my vote in behind the ""obsessive reviewer"", whose criticisms of this album are spot-on. Sal Mosca, despite a legend burnished by reclusiveness, couldn't touch the hem of Lennie Tristano's robes, never once achieving the almost levitating quality that Tristano always did when soloing on this material. There's none of the exhilarating uplift. Indeed, this only gets an extra star for Konitz, whose probity is undiminished. But he's pulling all the weight here, and it's heavy work."
4,Pillow to large,"I have a lot of neck problems and thought this would be ideal, however when it arrived I was unable to use it. Pillow very well made. Good quality."
2,Not what I Expected,"The cartridges are not recognized by the printer as being full of ink so the annoying ""low ink"" indicator comes up everytime you print. I wouldn't say that it outweighs the savings, however it is annoying. As advanced as technology is these days there should be someone who can ""reset"" the cartridge and fool the printer into thinking the product is OEM and brand new."
1,My Dell will not recognize & the ink still will not flow,"The seller was wonderful and fast. But the cartridge is a brick. My Dell all-in-one will not recognize it. And even if I override the cartridge is empty nag screen, the ink still will not flow. Nothing. I tried cleaning the nozzles and the printer will not even do that because it refuses to recognize it. Wasted money indeed."
1,NOTHING COMES OUT,I was so excited when the ink came in but once I installed it --it didn't read. My printer kept asking me for a cartridge. . .
5,Mark and Tom are da' bomb!,"I've been a fan of Better Days since they were the Artistics and let me tell you, these guys can jam. And they ain't bad looking either. If you don't buy this CD you are missing out on the beginning of something brilliant. Beautiful lyrics, sweet guitar and all that you need to enjoy a fabulous summer. I highly recommend Leaving the Blue."
2,"A humorous romance, yet it lacks that certain something.","I enjoy Marion Chesney's works and highly suggest them to anyone who is just beginning to start reading in this genre. They are all humorous and lively, with just a touch of romance. Back in Society is a fitting end to the sextet The Poor Relation. I found that it was probably ranked third best of this sextet. I preferred Vol.no.3 and Vol.no.1. Volume 6 refines on Lady Fortesque's character and brings out Miss Tonks, who had otherwise been a Nobody in the previous volumes. The humour is definitely provided and the romance is very sweet, as it is in all of her books. However, like most of Marion Chesney's books, this one is missing that certain something. The something that only experienced readers of this genre could find important. I began my reading in the genre with Volume Number 3 of this series, so I must confirm that Marion Chesney is a wonderful author to begin romance with."
3,British humor,"This book is the 6th in a series about how some aristocrats and some commoners too fell on hard times. They made a success of a business endeavor by hook or by crook. Very amusing. Our library had the first five, but due to budget cuts couldn't order the 6th, so I bought it, read it, and donated it to the library."
3,"Good Story, Poor Ending","Of the six Poor Relation novels, this is one of the best. However, the ending to the Poor Relation saga is, in my opinion, left wanting. In Back in Society, Marion Chesney tells an excellent story that makes a brave attempt to rival the in-depth plots of Jo Beverley and others. It falls short, however, in the characterization of her male characters."
2,BEWARE: Cheap media. How much do you value peace of mind?,"Radius Technology DVDs ID as ""OPTODISC"" brand media. (That is, OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius). OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy: poor compatibility with many burners and many ""coaster"" (unreadable) burns. Amazon has high quality RIDATA blanks for a little more money. I highly recommend you buy them instead. Save yourself a lot of headaches and (if you store anything of importance) heartbreak. There really *IS* a significant difference between very cheap DVD media (like these) and better DVD media (like the Ridata)."
1,Do not buy!!,"Really cheap!! Burnt 3 disks using Lite-On SOHW-832S. All 3 burnt OK, but later the same DVD drive had hard time reading back ALL 3 disks. Major Freezing problem on Philips DVP 642.Not worth the money!!As somebody else said, get Ritek instead! Or even Velocity!!"
3,Mizuno Glove,"Seems to be a fine product. However, the sizing is way off. Ordered a pair in XXL, and they fit smaller than a pair of XL I bought at a retail outlet."
3,"Very interesting, but not many answers.","This book is very entertaining. I bought it expecting to get answers on what became of Hitler's blood relations. I was disappointed in the amount of information concerning Hitler's nephew, and what became of him. But, it did have some fascinating evidence about Adolf's mother, father, and siblings. Worth a look, but, it's quite expensive for what you really get. I'd recommend checking it out from a library if you can."
3,Good product- took extremely long time for delivery,"This is a pretty good book. However, it concentrates primarily on the authors search for the Hitler relatives in the US and not so much on information about them. It does provide a look at Adolph Hitler as a young man which is actually pretty interesting. This is apparently a rare book, so it took 6-8 weeks for delivery which was kind of a disappointment."
1,Fictional story too quick of a fix!,The author fixes the life of this man in one week. This is very unrealistic.
1,Westcott Illuminator Storm Cloud Collapsible Background,"I returned this product, as it did not look anything like the picture. It has a lot of white highlights in the picture, but I found the product itself, to be basically gray with no real white highlights, but just lighter shades of gray. I did receive a full refund, although it cost me over $20.00 to return it."
4,Worked perfectly fine,"Product had identical batteries cells to our existing model, installed and has been holding a charge ever since. Excellent product."
4,great text book to study cloning and genetic engineering,i am doing Ph.D. in molecular biology and this book is very useful in the cloning and genetic engineering portion. i read this book from the library. it is the bible of genetic engineering and great text book for the subject.it gives a comprehensive study with minute details and recent advances. overall worth purchasing.
1,These don't work,"The promo for the Again & Again cordless phone batteries sounds good, but they don't work at all. I bought three of them to replace the batteries in all my Panasonic cordless phones. None of the batteries would hold a charge overnight, even if they weren't being used. If they were being used, they wouldn't last more than a few minutes."
4,Expensive Grocery Bills...Although Good In Theory,"The books content was both informative and educational. The dollars associated with the necessary meals was nearly $100 a week for two people, double what I would normally spend.Also, the time necessary to prepare the prescibed meals was impossible during the work week. It would take nearly an entire day to cook enough food for the entire week and all of the food we prepared (from the recommened cookbook) was over abundtly spicy.This plan is not time practical unless you enjoy spending a full day or late nights in the kitchen.In closing the book was good. But it's practicality in real life (time & dollars) is poor.Hey Cliff, maybe if you came out with your own line of prepared foods I'd give it another try!!!"
4,"Boots, Boots, Boots--Marching up and down again!!","This collection is comprehensive and carries many dates which serve to give a chronology and appropriateness to the poems. Of special note is ""the New Recruit"" where --""when you are wounded and left on Afganistan's plains, and the women come out to cut up what remains, roll to your rifle and blow out your brains, and go to your God like a Soldier, Soldier of the Queen""."
3,Profiles in Murder,"While this book outlined in detail the experiences of the profiler, it was set in a classroom type format. This was distracting to me because I wanted more information on serial killers. Having profiling explained over and over detracts from the information; I got it the first time around. I did enjoy the book and learned about how profiling got its start."
4,excellent reading for both professionals and lay people,"A quick and informative read. Well written, thoughtful, graphic but not gory,insightful look at the human mind and all its quirks."
3,Inventive but a bit disappointing,"After _Poor Things_, Gray's wonderful satire of Victorian literature, sexual politics, social convention, and who knows what else, I expected even solider and more inventive structure and style in _A History Maker_. Unfortunately the book is terribly uneven, the concluding chapters so rushed that the potentially important Delilah Puddock and the licentiousness she represents are insufficiently developed, the endnotes not carrying the comic punch of those in _Poor Things_ (or Nabokov's _Pale Fire_). Not a bad dystopian novel, better than average, but not Gray's best book either."
3,I really like Bavarian Fruit Bread,"This is a cd that takes a few listens to before it starts to reveal all its nicer qualities. I suppose I was thrown off a bit initially because I was expecting more of the ""Mazzy Star"" sound fom this release. In some ways, it's even better. If you like Hope's vocals, this cd will give you plenty of it, and in a more intimate way (I think) than on the Mazzy Star (I only have the last 2) recordings. The voice is more full-bodied and figures much more prominently in the mix. The slower songs have a subtleness to them that requires a few listens before you start to really appreciate them. I find myself wanting to listen to this cd more and more now. A nice respite from the stresses of the day. Bavarian Fruit Bread is a lovely first offering from Hope and the Warm Inventions. I hope there's more to come."
5,Sensual,"Most of what I purchase is jazz. But I take to things that are mystically dark and brooding, whether it's in art or music. Hope Sandoval was a complete unknown to me until I recently walked into a store in Santa Barbara and was immediately taken by what was emanating from their sound system. ""Who is this"" I asked the sales girl. She knew not what she was playing. So I insisted she take the disc off the player so I could see it. What a find. This is wonderful stuff for those into the genre'.The music sort of makes you want to be this woman's slave. And when you see a good picture of her, you know you're right on target."
4,Hope Goes her own Way,"Tell me how a girl from East Los Angeles developed into this amazing left field song writer?This album is Hope at her best - soft, warm, dreamy,spacey. Definetly an intimate album that is not lookingfor a single to top the charts, thank god. It seems thatColm added the perfect balance as songwriter/musician/friend. A keeper......."
5,Bavarian Fruit Bread,"if you're able to find this album, pick it up. it's one of the best albums i own. i play it almost every night."
2,"=so-so, a gorgeous voice with dull musicianship","Seductively beautiful music for autists & vegetables. Her vocals are stellar, but the music itself is SOOOO boring. What a shame! She desperately needs to expand her circle of musician friends. A more imaginative aural palette would far better suit her oh-so-alluring voice."
4,Wonderful Album....,"..had a hell of a time with the piracy of it off the internet though, reason being is that the first track is not called ""Hope""as listed here on Amazon, but is actually named ""Drop"""
2,"Still ""Hope""ing Mazzy Star will return !!","I haven't kept up with current music events like I used to in my college days, (10yrs ago). In fact I just found out Mazzy Star broke up a few months ago. I was happy to see hope was still recording so I was optimistic with this album. Sorry but it is just not the same. Hope still sounds good but the music is way to drab even for Hopes' style. This album isn't bad but it sent me running to my Mazzy CDs. Hope without Mazzy is like Harold Melvin without the Bluenotes, or like just one member of EnVogue. Again it's ok but the bar was set too high for this one to fly. Still love you thought Hope."
4,A glimpse of Turkey in the 16th Century,"I had the soundtrack CD from this film for a long time and love the music, but it took me years to find the film from which it came. I finally re-read the CD liner notes and tried finding a link to the film at the website of one of the producers -- bingo. And it was available from Amazon, so a few days later the film (a one-hour documentary on DVD) was in my hands.Suleyman the Magnificent was released in 1987, and the video quality is of that time. A lot of it is views of stills, a la Ken Burns's Civil War series; but this is effective and informative. Ian McKellan narrates. I learned a lot from watching the film, and I recommend it to anyone who is curious about Turkey, an important country and society that occupies a unique position in our world, the bridge between east and west."
1,More rehash from Roeper,"In his usual fashion, Richard Roeper again presents information he has gathered from other sources and tries to appear to be an expert on the subject. RR may be able to compile lists, but a true movie critic takes the time to explain his views. It is not difficult to prepare a list such as ""Worst Movie Sequels"" and then not explain what makes them bad. Roeper is capitalizing on the celebrity status he has fallen into since he has been paired with Roger Ebert. He is not a movie critic. He's a leech that Ebert has taken along for the ride."
2,"Next time, write a real book!","This book is more like a slightly extended magazine article. In fact, I've read articles in ""Movieline"" that were longer, and more informative.About one quarter of the book includes material that is well thought-out and entertainingly written. The rest is stuff that Roeper must have dictated into his voice recorder while doing other tasks.Roeper is clever and well-informed, but this book couldn't have taken more than two weeks to write. If you're looking for a truly quick read, this is the book for you. Just don't pay full price!I'm sure Roeper is capable of writing a good book, even a book of lists that has a little more ""meat."" But Roeper, and the publisher, shouldn't try to pass this off as more than a brochure."
3,very funny,"Given that this is a ""list"" book and there is very little discussion of WHY these movies were selected, I can't rate it higher. There is, as some reviewers pointed out, some obvious ratings here, but there's also some original stuff. I particularly enjoyed ""Movies in Which Ben Affleck Cries Like a Big Fat Baby,"" the Joan Rivers' Oscar bloopers, 10 Highly Stupid Habits of Movie People,"" and Pop Songs on Permanent Rotation - I'd always wondered how many movies had used ""Respect"" or ""All Star.""And his list of the worst movies ever was spot on - given that he limited it to 40."
2,Meh,"Covers well-worn territory and the lists, while unique, aren't particularly well written or surprising. Some of the movies every critic hated that he actually liked, are surprisingly lousy and undermine his authority as a film reviewer. The book is very thin as well and like other reviewers have pointed out, it seems culled from the web."
5,Two good quick reads!,"Young's idea producing technique is easy to learn and most importantly - effective. Creative ideas are key to winning new biz and retaining current accounts.As a Senior Account Exec I live by creatively meeting my customer's needs and the technique in Young's book has added real value.Another book I enjoyed is - The Sales Adventure Guide.I picked up a copy at the San Jose, CA Airport and read it on my 1-hour flight. The Sales Adventure Guide is full or real world business experience that will guide the reader/professional through all types of business situations - and there's no rah-rah to it.Read these two and thrive!"
4,Bernbach & Reinhard thought this was one of the best guides ever written for generating ideas,"When a friend discovered that I concepted for a living, she was suspicious. ""How can you be creative on demand?"" she asked. ""Everyone can come up creative ideas every once in a while. But when you need them? How do you do that? Do you have a notebook where you keep every idea? Do you use the same ideas over and over?""More than 70 years ago, James Webb Young, who had started at J. Walter Thompson as a copywriter before WWI and who became a professor of business history at the University of Chicago's School of Business in 1931 (while still working at JWT), wrote ""A Technique for Producing Ideas"" to explore just that question. To dig into the process that was - and hopefully still is - at the center of the advertising [to read the rest of this review, please visit [...]"
5,Very interesting,"As a writer of an idea Kindle book called """"Lightning Fast Non-Fiction Book Ideas - New Special Ways To Create Non-Fiction Book Ideas In Under Five Minutes And Even Just Seconds"" I found this book informative.The process involves getting your mind to come up with solutions all by itself. I can testify to it's effectiveness. I also know others who have used it to great success.Incidentally, it gave me the idea for my Kindle book called ""Google Adwords - The Simple Success Strategy"". The idea just popped into my head that a lot of people would benefit from the strategy I use."
1,So Dry idk what this guy is attempting to teach.,read anything new on the subject of inventing. if this pamplet has any ideas worthwhile someone has bilt on them since 1940.
1,Good ideas; sloppy publication,"While the ideas set forth are compelling, the grammatical, punctuation and spelling errors make this edition the worst thing in print that I have seen in a long time. The publisher should be embarrassed to sell this booklet."
4,Booklet - fine ; Shipping - not so good,"Simple, short ""how to"" info - knew what I was getting since I previously owned the booklet. The advice works. Have used the techniques for years - from memory. Didn't want to test my recall any more. Which brings me to Amazon's(?) shipping policies. I ordered 2 booklets (which weighed approx. 3ozs and measured 5""x8""x1/4""thick - combined); and they were sent usps in a single mailing envelope. The shipping cost to me was based on 2 shipments, when it was sent as one - at a distance of less than 200 miles (which took 11 days to arrive). If I had sent them anywhere in the USA under the same cover it would have cost me less than half the single shipment charge. When the seller/shipper was confronted with these facts, I was told that the overcharges were to pay for any shipping losses they might accrue in other book sales. As a small businessman, I never realized 'ripoffs' were so easily explained."
3,Short but true,"This book is a very short introduction to what ideas are all about,it does not tell you a lot, rather just the essentials for creativity,the steps to follow are true, you just need to realise what they are"
2,"Great content, poorly produced edition","I originally purchased this book a few years ago, and it earned a place of prominence on my book shelf. I have loaned it to several friends over the years, all of whom benefitted from the easy to read insight. Unfortunately, my copy was lost on loan recently, and I decided to replace it. The newer edition, however, is about as poorly produced as books come. There are too many grammatical mistakes and the clumsy book jacket design betrays a much smarter message contained within. If there were two categories for rating, I'd give this book 5 stars for content and 1 star for production quality. I'll keep my eye out for the next edition, which will hopefully find its place back on my shelf."
4,very good movie,I saw it in school and on on demand and I really really liked it a lot because it was fascinating and really really fun.
2,Ehhh,I thought this movie would be good but for some reason I just couldn't get into it. Maybe it's bc the story of Romeo and Juliet simply doesn't translate well into a kids movie.
2,VERY MISLEADING!!!!,"I just ordered this item and no where does it state that the dvd is missing it specifically notes that it is a blu ray & dvd combo pack as well as on the front it has where it said ""blu ray +dvd"" the +dvd is taken out. It should just say Blu ray since i got this so my daughter is able to watch it in our car as well in the house...which now i cannot, the movie is great but the fact that the title is misleading and im not getting all thats in it is upsetting."
5,J.W.,"I'M 36 YEARS OLD AND HAVE RENTED THIS MOVIE AT LEAST 4 TIMES.I HAVE NOT ENJOYED A MOVIE LIKE THIS IN SO LONG.YOU LAUGH,YOU SING, YOU CRY JUST A ALL AROUND WONDERFUL FUN MOVIE !! I 100% RECCOMEND THIS WHETHER YOU ARE 6 OR 106."
1,Cute but Not worth buying,"This is the standard Romeo and Juliete story minus the deaths, the tragedy and basically all the interest. My husband said it was a complete waste of time, but I feel it would've been okay to watch on cable or if you had a chance to watch it for free. Any type of charge to watch this would be money lost. The music has all been heard before and even though I love Sir Elton John, I wasn't impressed with the soundtrack. Visually it's appealing with lots of bright colors and the voice acting is pretty good. The storyline falls flat though and I feel like I just threw money down the toilet buying the blu ray with all the additional disks and digital files. If you're looking for a good family film or something entertaining then I recommend you skip this."
2,I lost $3.99 on this movie,"I watched the short (two minute) preview offered by Amazon, and thought it was not bad. So, I rented the movie despite a mixed review that I heard on the radio. The movie, rated PG for the unnecessary innuendo (""you're tulips are limp..."") especially for young children. After ten minutes of sub-standard CGI technology, and worse script, I had to turn it off. Gnomeo and Juliet turned Shakespeare's masterpiece into drivel. I want my money back."
1,No good,"In this movie, whenever the owners leave their home, the gnomes in the front yard would come to life and have fun. The idea sounds good, but this movie did not work for me.It is not that the movie did not follow the original story. I can not tell you exactly what the problem was, but after maybe about half an hour, I stopped watching and so did my five year old daughter. Maybe the problem was with animation, maybe it was the script, maybe it was the story. Some of the children movies are appealing to adults as well as the children. As an adult, this movie for me was just boring and lame, really lame.Sooo hit me, kick me, or spit on me if you want. I am giving this movie one star. :)"
2,Some inappropriate moments for family viewing,"There are a few inappropriate scenes in the film, for instance a very busty gnome girl calling out the rules of a race in a racy manner and wearing a blouse with a lot of cleavage. Other scenes with a male gnome in a very tiny spandex outfit that is meant to be funny but seemed a bit obnoxious in reality. We were a bit uncomfortable at times watching this with the kids. I don't recommend it for kids under 13, and if you're much older than 13 I have difficulty in seeing how you can like this film. My wife and I both couldn't wait for it to be over!"
2,Good movie but not a happy customer,Bought movie to find out that the digital download doesn't work if you live in Canada only can be done in us. What a joke! Last purchase ever!
4,Really Cute and age appropriate,"It is hard to find movies that are age appropriate for my almost four year old. I think the worst word in this movie was idiot and I can live with that.Really cute, my son loved the lawnmower battles and I enjoyed the musical parts.The jokes are cute and probably go over the younger ones heads but my son really enjoyed watching it."
3,"Movie not a keeper, but it was okay","We bought the movie because the reviews were stellar. As a parent, I was disappointed. The plot was unoriginal. My four year old liked it, but I have an 8, 10, and 12 year old who didn't have much to say about it good or bad. This is not the kind of movie I would normally buy. We got suckered by a gift card burning a hole in our pocket."
2,Bad Movie,"When I saw this movie I thought, ""How could anybody think this is good?"" This movie has almost no plot and the movie was released like nobody has edited this. If Pixar were to do a remake of this, I bet everything would be different and the movie would at least earn a B. From some of what I saw in the movie, it almost feels like the movie should have been rated PG. Reason is because in a G rated movie, most of the time the characters don't get destroyed or killed. In conclusion, I say, ""Nice start, but let another movie company redo this movie."
4,Good Introduction,"Our Movie day was suppose to be a Girls Day out with daughter and 3 year old Granddaughter. Not sure if this movie would keep her interest. But darned if it didn't. Granddaughter was totally into the story, she could pick out the hero (Romeo) the pretty girl (Juliet) and villian. Daughter and I enjoyed the Shakespeare references and spoofs. the voice overs were great to challenge your ears. And the music, well, Sir Elton was from my Era so I enjoyed all the tunes.Good movie for all ages. And good introduction to Shakespeare. Now the granddaughter will be able to look for this classic tale echoed in many books and movies to come."
3,"Great 3D Movie, Slow Moving Story....","I guess this may be a great movie for kids, but, as an adult, I find I didn't like it at all!!! It took me two days to watch the film and even then I was fast-forwarding a lot of times....as a movie, I give it 1-star... but, I give it 5 for 3D effects... the movie did take advantage of 3D technology very well and it was a visual feast.... I just didn't like it... not at all...."
2,Discs good digital not good for Canada,"The DVDs and Blu ray are great BUT the only reason I bought this version is because it includes a digital copy. But it will not work in Canada, ITunes says it is not available to non-US customers, which is NOT mentioned anywhere in the description, so obviously I fell a little ripped off."
1,Don't Bother,"What a horrible movie! I turned it off half way through when I decided we'd had enough of Juliette lying to her father, sneaking out of the yard to rendezvous with a boy, etc. Not appropriate for young kids. Language is a little too rough also. I don't like to hear ""idiots"", etc from a kids movie. Don't be fooled by the charming graphics and cute concept."
1,Horrible movie!,Did not follow the Romeo and Juliet story. Was a waste of my time! Don't waste your time with this movie!!!
1,"It does not play...it is ""broken""",This DVD does not work! I want to return it...will never order a DVD again from Amazon.com...bad experience. I ordered this for my granddaughter...very disappointing result!
3,Vaguely amusing,"I don't inherently object to new tellings of well-known stories, and R&J; has been retold more than most. I don't object to kids' movies - at least, not just because they're kids' movies.But good retellings preserve the depth of the original, even with a veneer of kid appeal, and good kids' movies offer a few nuggets to the grownup buying the movie tickets. This did neither.""Gnomeo"" was nicely done, but that's all: Nice. And I don't mean that in a particularly nice way.-- wiredweird, reviewing gthe release to theaters"
1,gnomeo and juliet,i was very disappointed with this movie it doesn't work and i threw all the papers away becuse i've never had trouble with ne thing i have bought now i have a movie that doesn't work and don't remember who i got it from
3,No digital copy,I bought this item to have the blue ray version and to have a digital copy for my son's iPad. It states it a three disc combo but there is no digital copy. The third disc includes bonus features without a passcode for the downloading of the digital copy. Blue ray works fine ...I just wish I would have the copy for long trips to view on the iPad.
4,"Movie quality pretty good, but I don't think this item is allowed to be sold in US.","The video I received has ""don't sell outside of Canada"" written on the label and comes in both French and English, which seems kind of sketchy. Also, the video has a slight picture-quality issue where the bottom and top half of the image don't completely align some of the time, but the price was right and my 3 yo continues to be delighted by it. The movie itself is really wonderful."
2,Tedious re-tell,"It's a fun premise, but the jokes in the story seem to fall flat and lifeless. One of the few movies I've started and didn't care to finish."
4,My daughter absolutely loves this movie,"My daughter and I love this movie, we watch it often. The quality of all the discs is great, the only reason why this is a 4-star rating is bc the digital copy was not included. Although I knew this already before purchasing it by reading the detailed description, I think the product listing should say it as well."
3,Cute Movie,"The movie was cute. There were a lot of words and references that the kids had no clue about. However they stayed entertained most of the movie. They said they liked it afterwards. My kids are both girls, 3 and 6. My 6 year old did seem distracted once or twice, but my 3 year old was paying attention the whole time, even though I know she didn't understand quite a few parts.Overall a decent family movie, but not much to make it stand out other than a happy ending you knew was coming."
2,Not one of Disney's best,"I bought this movie for my grandchildren and was disappointed. I'm not sure why,but they didn't care much for this movie. They lost interest in it after only a few minutes. This movie, in my opinion, will not become one of Disney's ""classics""."
4,Great music and pretty good family movie.,"This was a pretty good family movie with some great Elton John music throughout the entire movie. Cute, funny and not too long with a great soundtrack."
2,I'd rather have cleaned the toilet,"...at least then I'd have been productiveDid the film make me suffer in agony? No.Did I enjoy it? No.My one word description of it is ""Bleh."" I did, however, appreciate that it was clean. I hate it when kids movie sneak smutty references into them. We have no kids, so I can't say whether or not kids would enjoy it, but I felt like it was one of those movies that are a little too dumbed down for kids.Plot: 2Animation:4Soundtrack: (depends on how much you dig Elton John)Jokes:2Joke Delivery:1Script: 2Terraferminator voice over by the Hulk: 4.5"
2,I would have rather had my foot nailed to the floor...,I really wanted to like this movie. I was so excited when it finally made it to the Video On Demand and I could rent it. I popped my bowl of popcorn. Got my favorite beverage ready. I even opened a bottle of wine about half way through... but the bottle of wine was to help me endure the remaining half of the movie.It was hokey. The graphics were great but I felt that all the jokes were forced and the story line made me wish . I was so dissapointed. I was excited when I found out that it was from one of the creators of Shrek... I had such high expectations. But it was just not my cup of tea... and it severly ruined my glass of wine.I realize that we each have our own preferences. I am not saying this is a absolute NO for everyone. It was just not for me... and I really like movies like this. The movie did not deliever what I was expecting.~TMM007.
4,Grandkids liked it.,"I have not seen the movie (my wife did the preview) but then I bought for our granddaughters to watch this summer when they are here. I think the older one liked it more than the younger 2, but overall they liked it."
2,gnomeo and juliet,"The dvd was in perfect condition, but did not realize it was a copy of the original. That was not revealed in the discription of the DVD. I wouldnt play in all the DVD players."
2,Okay,"All the jokes from the commerical were in the last 10 minutes of the movie. They've definately produced better, although the songs were catchy."
2,disappointed to say the least,even my twin 3 year old girls and 7 year old son got off the couch and walked away from this movie. just awful...
4,cute movie,hard these days to find quality entertainment for entire family; this is a cute movie that even a boy can watch
4,Gnomes With Attitudes,"Took my granddaughter to see this with zero expectation of enjoying it, (SPOILER) but when I saw Jason Statham as the bully and the great Death Race scene, I perked up. A lot of other movie references and great Elton John music (Elton Johns gnome cracked me up) made this the best Shakespeare movie since Shakespeare In Love. A lot of the humor will go right over kids heads, but they'll love the colorful characters and music."
5,great movie,The movie I purchased was exactly what I was looking for. It was in brand new condition and came to me guickly in the mail. Te movie itself was adorable-great for my first graders.
5,very cute,My kids and I love this movie! It's great for parents dreading having to watch another cartoon. Has humor perfect for adults and children.
4,A Wonderful Sailor's Tale,"Arthur Gordon Pym was a young man who had dreams of great adventure. He defied his family and stowed away on board a whaling ship. Doing this lead him into all sorts of exciting adventures. He confronted things like mutiny, near starvation, and altercations with different cultures.I'd have to say that this story is ""classic Poe"". If you are a fan of Poe's short stories, you'll definitely like this book. I only had a few problems with the story. There were times that the story dragged, but this is far outweighed by the times that the story was very exciting, and I couldn't put the book down. I won't go into the ending, but it left me unsettled.I found that the explanatory notes were very helpful. I'm not a great scholar on any level, nor will I ever claim to be. The explanatory notes were very simple to understand, and it helped me understand portions of the story that caused confusion, particularly the end."
4,Horrifying,"The cumulative horror this work builds is almost unimaginable.I had incredible feelings of anguish throughout. There were times I really didn't think I could bear to read any more. The more detached the narrative gets, the more haunting the story becomes.I can only give it 4 stars because I'm amazed a piece of writing could make one so uncomfortable and so disturbed. This is not by any means psychologically appropriate for a young person to read. Even for an adult, I would not sit down to read this unless you're sure you are prepared to face the literary equivalent of torture. Of course, it's not that it's not well written. In many ways, it's ingeniously constructed. However for those with an imagination capable of projecting this story as it happens.. You will find your psychological limits greatly tested."
1,Flat Live Recordings,"I had high expectations for this release, yet was disappointed in the live recordings for two reasons:The removal of the crowd noise left a glaring hole in the recording and the choice to fade in and out for each track.Any live recording should hope to capture the excitement of actually being at the concert, and this recording fails to do that. It gives the listener the feeling that we're only getting a portion of the performance.The new tracks are enjoyable, but not enough to carry the entire album. Hollywood Records would have been better to remaster the original, or give us an entire live performance from beginning to end."
3,pleasant but unfulfilling,"Coming from a true R&B; lover,I would say there is no reason that the new tracks couldn't do well with conventional tunes,But the live tracks leave you wanting more. They bring back memories and some can even be used to party to. (get it up, the bird,cool).Only complant I have is there could have been tracks like (walk,wild and loose, oak tree,the character,etc).This addition would have made up for the fact that FISHNET is not a full version easily.All and all I like it."
2,No live feel at all!!!!!!,"first of all i love morris day and the time,But this is all but live.it sounds like a bad and i do mean bad studio cd,it faes in and out like a cd theres no live feel at all the songs are too short.its just not what a live cd should sound like from such a good group.........so please beware and dont buy...sorry.......super D"
2,Not a Groovin Good Combo.,"Well 1st thang is It's a good thang that Mo Day made a new album but....I felt like somethin was wrong with it. 8 Old-Skool joints in a live format? It was ok, but it ain't all that groovin good, especially tryin to make a live stuff silent. If I wanted The Best of Morris Day & The Time, I would've Combined the hits from the previous TIME albums (plus 2 Morris Day Tracks) and called it THE Best TIME Ever: 1981-1990.Now As of the 4 new songs......I enjoyed all except one: ""2 Drink Minimum"" didn't flow with me. ""Ain't a Damn Thing Changed"" is worth bouncin to. ""In My Ride"" has a good Cameo Appearance of E-40 rappin. Finally, ""Last Night"" Had an excellent guitar riff in what I consider a funky/rock feel.The New Tracks saved it for me. If u want somethin new out of Morris Day & The Time, just buy this for the brand new tracks."
3,Morris is still the man!,"As you have read the other reviews, this album could have been way more LIVE!It's such a waste 2 have The Time on a live album and have the songs cut short and have certain words censored(What the Funk?).I still love hearing these jams though and the four new cuts show that Morris can change with the ""times"".Did you know that Prince named Morris as his favourite drummer in ""Modern Drummer"" magazine?! That's some major publicity and respect. I hope The Time come out with a full length album with all the original members, we need a change in this boring age of typical R&B.If you really want live check out Cameo's album ""Nasty""(serious funk)."
3,"OK, should have been better...","I concur with A Music Fan from Nashville re: the ""live"" tracks. The sound quality itself is really good (for a live recording), but why edit out the crowd's reaction/participation?? Also, there are obvious ""gaps"" in the vocals where Hollywood Record edited out what were apparently ""naughty"" words. (Naughty words? ITS MORRIS DAY... that's the whole POINT.) I'll be my own censor, thank you, Hollywood Records.As for the new studio tracks, the songs themselves are fine, but they REALLY point up how superior actual LIVE MUSCIANS are when compared to programmed drums/bass/keyboards (which is what was used on the studio tracks). Had the studio tracks been recored with actual LIVE MUSICIANS I'd have given this CD 4 stars..."
3,All i want to know is...,"WHERE IN THE DICKENS IS THAT NEW TIME ALBUM ""OLD DOGS, NEW TRICKS"" THAT THEY'VE BEEN PROMISING US SINCE THE ""GRAFFITI BRIDGE"" DAYS?"
4,Handy size for tighter spots,"I just installed two of these (very easy installation) in spots where a full-sized towel rack would be too long. I don't like towel rings, so was happy to find this item."
3,Too wide,"I really loved the look of this towel bar online, but when I got it out of the packaging it stuck really far out from the wall. I have a really small bathroom and couldn't afford to have my towel rack sticking so far out, so I had to return it. I was pretty bummed because the style was exactly what I was looking for, it just needs a little refining."
5,Great product,"Great styling, very high quality in material and finish and easy to install. The instructions were easy to follow and you cannot beat the speed of shipment. Great transaction and delivered right on schedule."
1,annoying,"i watched the movie at work since i was bored and has spare time..not to mention it was free..and it was annoying. the story line as you have probably read before is about an artist who goes a bit batty and kills people with a drill. the story sounds like it has potential but for some reason there are alot of shots with a very bad band playing. i know part of his reason for going insane is due to the relentless band but there is too much of the band. the acting is sketchy and the gore is low but it is an older film so i wasn't expecting much. with slow pacing thrown into lackluster acting and death sequences, it makes the movie rather tedious to watch. also, i could have done without the close up breast shot which slowly span out to show his two girlfriends/roommates in the shower together."
3,Not that good,"Not Ferrara's cult classic film, not a good horror film. But worth watch at least once,I liked the extra first films on 2nd disc of the limited edition, but i think Richard Kern short films represents the New York scene on the end the 70's better than Ferrara did on this film, if you know what i mean."
1,A rip-off DVD,"Ferrara's worst film has a mumbling, slurring audio commentary & when this ""director's cut"" ends, someone has cut to a red frame before the film ends, causing the director to say, ""What! That's not my ----ing ending! Who the ---- cut my film! "" His comments abruptly stop--end of commentary! Plus, the commentary track was tranferred about 5 seconds out of sync, all the way thru (not that you can understand him, anyway), tho he has next to nothing intelligent/intelligible to say about the film's production anyhow! Possibly the worst commentary ever recorded; where's our great MS. 45 when you need her!"
1,All in all a poor film,"I have seen some poor films in my time but this is one of the worst. The plot was weak and hidden between large amounts of tedious and poor punk rock (Don't play the film loud as the cover suggests!). I had absolutely no sympathy for any of the characters and did not feel sorry for any individual that was killed with the poor gore effects. If violent bloodshed is what your after then I would recommend the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Abel Ferrara is attempting to create a documentation of madness of the same quality as Roman Polanski's classic ""Repulsion"" but ultimately fails. (He even copies the use of the dead rabbit as part of the insanity.)"
1,so boring and dull,"A young artist is being driving insane by everyone around him, but after he can't sell his painting he snaps, he picks up a drill and runs around the streets killing people at random. Ok now, this was a godawful movie, one of the worst I have ever seen in my entire life. It's just as bad as The Nostril Picker, there is nothing in this movie worth seeing, there is violence but it doesn't matter the movie is just far to boring to care, I can only say please, whatever you do, DON'T rent this horrible movie, words can not describe how bad it is or how boring it is, this movie is just so bad I can't give it any star rating at all."
1,"all i can really say is ""no""","Ferrara is obviously a required taste and this film does nothing to prove against that point.not only is he a horrible actor, but he's also one of the worst directors with an undeserved cult following. his camerawork is atrocious and wreaks of a bad home movie.the back of the DVD says that Abel was trying to make a film in the vein of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but in the end wound up making a film more like that of Taxi Driver. now, even before i watched the film, i knew this was an incredibly gross overstatement, but now i think the DVD company that made such a horrid claim should be forced to remove that from the synopsis.oh, and the band in the movie was terrible. hell, everything about this movie was terrible. Ferrara is a failure."
5,DRILLER KILLER THRILLS,"Alright,so maybe,just maybe this isn't the greatest movie ever made but it is still a great movie. Like other directors first movies it has the raw strength of vision and commitment compares well with Scorceses-'Mean Streets'.It's also a brilliant documentation of mental disintergration comparable with Scorceses 'Taxi Driver' It's also somewhat gory and frightening in it's intensity like 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. If you like disturbing films,go ahead and watch Abel Ferarra's first feature and get inside his head."
3,My sister is the ex-wife,I want to know why my sister can't talk about her divorce from Ed Oster that had to take place before this marriage and book could be written. A divorce with a gag order ?
1,Lightweight love advice,"I expected this book to be about Donna Hanover's life but it is actually a collection of other people's lost and found love stories and advice on how to find a lost love. The format is very similar to ""Lost and Found Lovers - Facts and Fantasies of Rekindled Romances"" by Nancy Kalish, Ph.D. The stories are charming but after the first few become rather repetitive. Ms. Hanover's attempt to discuss the lost love phenomenon is unsatisfying and incomplete with only random references to research and comments from friendly psychologists. She is advocating that single women/men look up their old boyfriends/girlfriends without fully addressing the deeply emotional and complicated dilemmas that might arise if such a reunion doesn't work out."
1,disappearing reviews,"[...]As a reunited couple, we looked forward to reading another book on this topic. We had read Kalish's research in Lost & Found Lovers and bought several copies for friends. So I thought this new book would be good too. I was all set to like it. But I didn't. It was so disappointing.It's just a few light stories, and some interviews with therapists. What did she have to contribute herself? Her story was fun to read, but that could have been a nice, short magazine article. There's not enough here for a book. I finished it in an hour and a half.DH interviewed Nancy Kalish - she says so in the acknowledgements - and this sure sounds like the kalish book without the research that made that first book worthwhile.I think the people who give it 5 stars just haven't read any other books on this topic and so they don't know the difference. It's a fun topic but it is not a good book."
1,"He is back, but what about everything in between?","This book is a disappointment. It doesn't mention the reason why people get married to someone other then ""the boyfriend"". It questions the sincerity of long marriages in between. There is nothing to be proud of if your life was fake for 30 years or longer."
2,what about the men?,I was put off by this titile - it seems to be pitched for women only - but I read it anyway. what do men experience? I may want to look up my girlfriend but this book hints at risks but then glosses them over. I wish it had the informnation i was looking for. this didn't answer my questions at all.
2,Not very good...,"I played this game for a few hours and then returned it the next day. The controls for doing tricks are really, really annoying. The graphics are average--nothing great but not ugly. Compared to what the PS2 can do, this game should look and play a heck of a lot better."
4,As real as real can get,"MX 2002 is the coolest game i have ever seen or played in my life. The different play modes, tracks, and riders. I'm a dirtbike jucky, if you own a bike or known what riding is about you will love this game."
1,awesome,"This massage book arrived to me in a couple of days, and is in excellent condition. thanks for expediting the service."
4,good delivery,"Speedy delivery. I was satisfied. Book was in good condition, no marks, bended pages or anything."
1,Hated this reprint,"The scans for this reprint were low resolution, and the pages weren't even straightened. I was pretty disappointed. I'm not going to comment on the book content at all. Just the binding and finishing."
3,A bit Life-less,"Thin Lizzy is awesome, but this 'live' recording feels pretty lifeless... undoubtedly due to the numerous and sometimes obvious overdubs. Get 1978's ""Live and Dangerous"" instead."
3,"Old music, fun listening","Take me out with the crowd. Baseball, old times haven't charnged so much. People are still the same. Listen to the words of the songs and you'll see they had many of the same problems we have now. Good for history buffs."
3,Somewhat disappointed,I read the previous revies- stated you get what you see in the pic. You don't get the nose. Ears and tail are only offered in this kit. The tail has a wire in it -which makes it bendable. Ears are difficult to keep on but should do the trick for the overall costume.
5,Great,Exactly what I needed. What you see is what you get. This was a great buy to complete my costume.
3,Re-think before you buy,Not what's shown in the picture. Spots ar pockadots that don't look like a dalmation and no nose. What a skam. Amazon should not represent co's like these. No time to do anything else now.
3,It's alright.,"""The ears and tale arrived in good shape, but the ears didn't lay too well. I had trouble with them. """
4,nice birthday gift!,got this for my friend for her birthday and she loved it! it looks good on fair skin rather than tan.
5,sterling silver with swarovski crystals ankle bracelet,This is a beautiful piece of jewelry! Simple yet elegant. I really love this ankle bracelet!
2,ankle bracelet,"The sterling on the ankle bracelet turned black almost immediately. Unfortunately, I had thrown away all of the shipping info, otherwise I would have returned it."
1,False Advertising,"Paid for 2 cases of 12, they sent me 2 bottles...Still want what I paid for and what was advertised. BEWARE, THEY WILL NOT SEND YOU WHAT YOU PAY FOR AND WHAT IS LISTED. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCEDO NOT BUY!!!!"
5,Works,"Aging and weight gain seem to be related...at least in me...aceyl L carnitine has helped me with balancing my metabolism. It is not a weight lost fast fixed...but it has me to keep weight off without changing my dietary intake too much. When I first started taking this supplement, I felt a slight flush, but after a week..my body has adapted with no other reactions."
2,I can't handle the size,"Do they work? Yes, they do. But getting them down is not an experience I'd recommend. I normally have very little trouble with pills in general--even calcium pills which (up to now) were the biggest and hardest pills I'd had to deal with. These are much larger: more than 3/4"" long, more than 1/4"" high (domed on both sides) and more than 1/4"" across. When they get stuck, it really hurts. I'm not repeating this purchase. I'm going to buy lower potency pills and take whatever number I need to take to add up to 750mg dosage I've been recommended."
5,Fantastic.,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. Mrs. Gilbert weaves a beautiful tale about a how young, city-wise, widowed mother's search for hope leads her to the last place she ever expected to find herself: cooking for a team of swarthy ranch hands on a failing cattle ranch in Wyoming. The pastoral imagery is stunning and vivid. The family scenes will make you laugh and cry and feel emotions you've long forgotten. This book will transport you to a place so foreign, yet so familiar.. a place you've longed to be your whole life. No matter what age you are or what your background is, YOU. WILL. LOVE. THIS. BOOK."
5,Dance Of Death & Other Plantation Favorites,This is an old favorite from a rather unique acoustic player. I have this onvinyl and decided to get it on CD. Nice blend of simplistic folk blues and imaginativeplaying.
3,My first John Fahey,"I was led to this album [...]. There is great guitar work on this album, both fingerpicking and slide. I really don't know how it compares to other Fahey albums, but this album on the surface has a laid back sitting on the porch quality, but the more I listen to it, the more I hear a foreboding dark quality to the playing. It's not the highest quality sound since it was recorded on the fly in the '60's. Don't let my review be the only one you read about this album."
1,I didn't receive the product ....,I bought the product but I didn't receive the product. The vendor service was bad.
1,wrong size listed--beware,"The size is listed as ""38x30"" although the tag and futher down in the description it shows the actual size as ""48x30"". I did not order this but I was browsing and noticed the mistake."
5,Timeless Classic,"I acquired my first copy of ""Handling the Big Jets"" during my university days when studying aeronautical engineering (at Loughborough University of Technology, Leicestershire, England) in the early 1980s. This was an excellent reference book then on handling jets as it covered all the major topics that I needed comprehensively, in simple and easy to read language and explanations.However, decades later, it is difficult to find a similar definitive book on the subject. This makes ""Handling the Big Jets"" an important part of my library which I consult on subjects ranging from aerodynamics to aircraft control and stability.This is a timeless classic which should be an indispensable part of every pilot and aircraft engineer's library."
3,bad customer service,"I like the look of this pack and play. It sits in my living room and it doesn't look like a child has taken over. I bought a piece of foam that fits snuggly and it does make for a good second crib in the house. It's relatively easy to put together, and we managed to do it before even reading the instructions. Now the bad: the bassinet is pretty small and our baby didn't like to sleep in it from the start. She was already too big for it by 6 weeks of age. Because this basinet is a bit small, sheets have to be ordered directly from Combi. I called to place an order for replacement sheets and I got the wrong item in the mail. Instead of sheets I got two outside covers, which I would never describe as sheets. The person on the phone kept blaming me for not describing the item the right way. I didn't get a receipt with the package, and even though they promised to send me a return receipt, I never got the receipt or a replacement. This company has very bad service indeed."
3,Great changing table...,"We bought this because of space and money restraints. It is also quite handsome and not covered in frou-frou or ugly designs. So far our daughter is 3 months and we've loved the changing table, but she has yet to sleep in the thing. This is not because we have not tried; every time I put her down, she would wake up in minutes. The little hood to the basinet does not come off. When it is folded up her head would rub against the folded fabric. I have had to make other sleeping arrangements and she sleeps just fine there. I can't figure it out but I am wishing I had taken my $130ish dollars and bought a nice changing table instead. SO if your baby sleeps well in a pack and play, this one is very nice. If you aren't sure, borrow one first!"
3,Not good for selfstudy,"This book is hard to understand and not good for self study. On the back side of the book it is written that""...companian web site provides the following resources for both lecturer and student:* Lecture Plans* PowerPoint slide shows* Solutions to end of chapter exercises* Revision Questions* Weblinks* Case studies.""I tried to access the website but i noticed that those resources are not for students although they mentioned so.I donot recommend that book instead buy one of N. Gregory Mankiw's economics book.Regards,"
5,Great oringal artwork,"Baum is creative and very unique. Doroty and Toto get sweep up by the terible twister and she meets a good witch, who sent to the great Oz and you need to read the story to see how the twisting tale ends up, the book is a little different than the movie. Its great for any age kids or adults."
5,The American FairyTale,"""The Wizard of Oz"", in my opinion, is the American Fairytale, and is far more better than any Brother Grimms or Aesop Fables! As stated, the book is better than the movie, and, the Oz Book series has reached over 200 sequels, by dozens of authors! The Wizard of Oz has a wonderful moral in it that is true for all of us. It is, and always will be, my favorite story."
3,Item received not as shown,"See the item photo to the right? That's not what I got. I wanted the book to have that exact cover so I searched, found this ad and placed the order. But what I just received in the mail has a completely different cover. I'm VERY disappointed."
4,A Great Book,"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a classical story about a girl and her dog that get trapped in a twister. She wakes up in a magical land and asks how she can get home. They tell her she has to follow the yellow brick road. She meets people on her way to the Wizard. The Scarecrow needs brains, the Tinman needs a heart, the Lion needs courage and Dorothy needs to go home. They meet strange things on the way to The Good Witch of the South. I like the book because it's interesting and exciting and that's why I think you should read it."
3,"Book is 4""x6""","This is a nice hardback book, but I didn't realize it was miniature, only 4""x6"". Maybe this was mentioned in the item description and I missed it--I just wanted other customers to realize what they were getting."
3,Oz book,I was disappointed in the book. It was in good shape other than the 2nd or 3rd pg being torn in half & not being there. I can handle torn but the remains need to be there to repair.
5,Still a Wonderful Read for Children and Families,"I hate to admit that reading this book to my 9-yr old daughter was the first time I ever read the actual text by L. Frank Baum. I was surprisedly impressed by the eloquent writing and creative story. I think the text is truly better than portrayed in the classic movie. I expected to be somewhat bored by it but was eager to read each chapter. I heartily recommend this version of the story, as it includes black & white illustrations and readable font."
5,Wizard of Oz (Wordsworth Collection),"Having watched the movie on numerous occasions I thought that it would be pertinent to read it. I dare say, that this was a splendid and brilliant experience. L. Frank Baum has managed to create an astounding fantasy world that includes the tinman, the strawman and the lion all which are looking for attributes that they sorely lack in their lives. The discriptors used and the verbage are nothing short of amazing and I love every single page of this great and fascinating story. I highly recommend it."
4,I THINK IT IS A VERY INTERESTING BOOK.,I LIKE THIS BOOK VERY MUCH. I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE PART IN WHICH DOROTHY MEETS THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST.I ALSO LIKE THE 'TIN-MAN' AND THE 'WINKIES'.
2,"Good, But Undeserving Of Its Status","Actually two and a half stars. America has, unfortunately, produced fewer true ""fairy tales"" than Europe. And though Americans could enjoy the old stories, simple and universal as they are, we needed new ones with the distinctive qualities of our land. ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"", American tall tales, and the comic book creations of the 1950s and 60s are what we have produced to fill the gap. When I first read this book at 7 years old, I was disappointed it was so different from the movie, which I loved then, but as I've grown older I've found the book to be superior, because it depicts Oz as less of a benign candyland. Despite this the book (and its sequels even more so) is seriously flawed. These are flaws of imagination: like the works of Roal Dahl many of the people who read the Oz books see them as unbridedly imaginative. They arent. C.S. Lewis built a cousin-world to Oz with much more imagination and style in his far better Narnia books. Read them instead."
1,better versions available,This is an edition of The Wizard of Oz with two long critical essays by the editor. The two recent biographies of L. Frank Baum by Loncraine and Schwartz are both excellent and much better than these essays.
5,The Wizard of OZ,"Dorothy and Toto are living in Kansas when a squall blows them and their house to the land of OZ. In OZ Dorothy and Toto meet the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodsman and the Cowardly Lion. They all want help from the wizard, but the wizard gives them a task of destroying the Wicked Witch of the West. The Witch sees them coming so she sends her bees to get them. But the bees are frightened of them. The Witch sends the crows to get them, but the scarecrow scares them off. Then the Witch sends her wolves but the Tin Woodsman gets rid of them. To find out what happens next, please read the book. I also recommend The Marvelous Land of Oz. There are many other books in the series. Out of the ones I've read, they are magical and happy. I recommend this book for all readers."
4,A Review From 1st Graders,"Our class just finished this book. We think it was excellent and would recommend you read it, too. The first reason you should read it is that it was very funny. Another reason to read this book is it had great details and word choice. Lastly, if you like books that can be a little mysterious and scary, this book is for you! Read the Wizard of Oz by Frank Baum."
2,"Yes, has most images.... but not all, and poor quality","The review title says it all. This book is illustrated, but it doesn't have ALL the original illustrations (for example, missing the dedication to his wife, and the color plate of Dorothy holding Toto by the ear from the flying house in Chapter 1). Also the images are not great quality (JPEG noise) and have a yellow background around them (appearing grey on the eink kindle). There are better (and cheaper) illustrated versions out there. Always check a sample, or"
5,Dorothy's Adventures In Oz,"This book is so good. I couldn't put it down! In my version I had an encounter with the good witch of the south named Glinda, little porcelain people, monstrous beasts with heads of tigers and bodies of bears, the queen of the field mice and her people, a deadly poppy field, the little Quadlings, and of course the tin woodman, the cowardly lion, the scarecrow, the Good Witch of the North, the munchkins, the winkies, the winged monkeys, the emeralites, and the great and powerful humbug Wizard of Oz! read it time after time after time. Great to read to or with kids. Excellent reading for all ages!"
3,Great Story.,"I did not grow up with the Oz books. I first read this story when I was about 11. And I WAS surprised at how DIFFERENT it was from the MGM movie. So many things were changed, added and cut. This story is both delightful and charming. A living scarecrow, a woodman made of tin and a lion that is cowardly all go searching for wisdom, love and courage that they all already have. But in this ORIGINAL story it talks a lot about DEATH, and there are some VIOLENT and SCARY scenes that I am GLAD that MGM either ommited or just didn't put in. Especially since most of those scenes involve my dear Tin Woodman. I am having so much trouble accepting my dear Tin Woodman being once a man of flesh and bone and having a REAL name (Nick Chopper) and being the King of the Winkies and especially not seeming to have a REAL heart. Especially since Denslow's illustrations make him look so positively CUTE!"
3,Wizard of Oz book review,"The used book arrived in a timely manner. It had obviously been used and had many library stamps on the inside covers, but was in good condition."
3,"A ""not so"" wonderful wizard of Oz","The reason I read this book was because of all the high praise I hear about it. Don't get me wrong the book was wonderfully written for a 5 year old. There were some parts I enjoyed but most parts left me bored and wondering when it will end.To any child or,parent looking for a book for a child, this book is for you. But to the teenagers and adults that don't enjoy children's books, this book isn't for you."
3,"A ""not so"" wonderful wizard of Oz","The reason I read this book was because of all the high praise I hear about it. Don't get me wrong the book was wonderfully written for a 5 year old. There were some parts I enjoyed but most parts left me bored and wondering when it will end.Most of you have seen the movie, some of you have seen it many many times. What i'm getting at here is that book was actully worse than the movie. The book has a bunch of different and wierd parts that the movie didn't have.After awhile dorothy get annoying when see keeps complaining that see wants to go home and she seems not to care about anyone exept for her dog toto.To any child or,parent looking for a book for a child, this book is for you. But to the teenagers and adults that don't enjoy children's books, this book isn't for you. It may seem that i've been harsh on the book but there is some good parts too. Its also a classic so it wouldn't hurt to read this book."
3,Free SF Reader,"Someone pointed out a movie reviewer who has succinct entertaining reviews, via livejournal, and the one for this story went something like this:-Girl stars adventure with a killing, gets three friends, and goes off to kill some more. (A Canadian movie reviewer I think they said. Which, really is pretty funny. Good enough to shamelessy borrow and rehash seeing I had never seen that before.Of course, not really the point of the kid's story, as such, with its fables about being accepted, but a good one nonetheless. Monkeys fly, but not out of anyone's butt, unfortunately."
2,Looks great but really dull,not a good straight razor for beginners but it looks really nice if that's what your going for. I don't even use it.
5,A Peek at Pueblo and Navajo Life,"A wonderful little book featuring original woodcuts, by the author, along with informative text explaining each illustration.One greatly appealing aspect of this book is its simplistic depiction of Pueblo and Navajo life. It is an ideal learning tool for adults and children alike."
2,William J. Hennessey's Modern Furnishings for the Home,"Not a bad book and it might be just what you're looking for. 300 pages, all b&w, picture quality is only fair. I guess this book belongs in a quality library but I found it generally disappointing at the price."
2,"Excellent sound quality, weak setlist","Too bad the band didn't include more songs from Savage Amusemnt like Don't Stop at the top or Media Overkill. ""Tease Me..."" sounds awesome and it's the best track on the album, however the album has very few live songs and a double album could've been better. Still enjoyable, but a album only for die hard fans."
4,One of the best live albums of the Scorpions,This is one of the greatest albums of the Scorpions. It doesn't have all the classics(it is missing a lot of the classics) but it is still a good album with the bonus studio songs. It sounded better because they made all the songs go a little bit faster which makes you more alert and active instead of listening to slow songs which sometimes make you sleepy. I recommend this if you are a die-hard fan of the Scorpions.
3,Turn up the volume!,"Live Bites is a great compliation of live performances by the Scorpions. The musicianship on this album is superior, from Meine's smooth vocals to the combination of shreading riffs between Jabs and Rudolf Schenker. ""Tease Me Please Me"" is a great track that starts off the album on a great, energetic note. Such ballads as ""Rhythm of Love"" and ""Wind of Change"" really capture the crowd (and you) as you listen. The hard hitters on this cd include ""No Pain No Gain"" and ""Alien Nation"". Overall a great Live album despite not including some of their biggest hits."
3,My opion,I had to do an assignment in my stagecraft class and my teacher said read this you will probably like this. Usually i hate to read but this book was great. I started to read and i couln't even put it down. The book is down to earth but just helorous. I would recommende this book to who ever.Thanks very much
2,Not the same color as on the detail page!,"So disappointed and will be returning this. The color of the product on the detail page is an elegant dark-grey with a smattering of green, but the actual product itself is very green and drab looking. I've attached an actual photo. Is it sage? I suppose. Is it dark? No. Is it anything like the product photo? Not at all."
4,Go2 It,"A personal favourite of mine with the first half pretty much flawless and ""beatown"",""greenhouse"" are really unsung x.t.c classics.Great album cover Great concept and great studio (abbey road).By the way I give this 4 stars because I've ommited the barry andrews songs.(Not essential)and you should too.Anyhoo after this one they got rid of barry and got a guitar god instead.Enjoy!"
4,Some Cool Stuff,"Go 2 isn't XTC's best effort, but it's still very enjoyable. I find the category of music that it's in to be very unique--it's considered ""post-punk"", which is supposed to be between punk rock and new wave. Hence, it's a transitional piece of music that works well. This unique sound is evident on such standout tracks like MECCANIC DANCING, CROWDED ROOM, THE RHYTHM, RED, and the classic, ARE YOU RECEIVING ME? which has Dead Kennedy's-type vocals past the midway point of the song. While the album sort of crawls to the finish line with some weaker tracks such as LIFE IS GOOD IN THE GREENHOUSE, JUMPING IN GOMORRAH and MY WEAPON, it's still a solid release. You will notice the speed of the songs right away, as most of them are faster than what fans are used to from XTC. Punk is certainly fast, and we're treated to a nice blend of punk and new wave that will charm the listener. 8/10"
4,A Glowing reiview of a classic band.,"This album typifies the sound of the late 70's post-punk scene in England. The sound is tight, fast, and very energetic. The first song (Meccanic Dancing) is driven by a angular guitar riff and classic hiccup style vocals by Partridge. Very fun indeed. Of course like most albums there are a few duds but still fun. My fave tracks are Jumping in Gomorrah (because it puts religous zealots in place), Red, and I am the Audience which is an electrifying New wave/punk stomper.As well listening to Go 2 you can hear where many current bands (Blur, Bis, and even Green Day) pick up their snotty yet propulsive sound. A great album which will keep you on your feet dancing or bopping."
3,Wrong Title,"From the tracklisting, this appears to be the Go + EP, a giveaway with copies of Go 2, and not the album itself. It's pretty much Andy Partridge's dub versions of songs from Go 2. Probably of interest to die-hard XTC fans only, and completists."
3,Good stuff. Funny cover,"This is unusual music - very new wave 80s. Good stuff if you like that. XTC fans should have it. Raw, but not as raw as White Music. Approaches Drums and Wires in style."
3,For Completists Only!,"Unarguably, this is the group's least liked album, and though it stands far above most of the drivel that other bands release these days, it falls short from the usual excellence with which XTC has rewarded its admirers (and there are more out there than most people may realize!).There are a handful of eyebrow-raising moments here, like the lyrics to ""Jumping in Gomorrah"" and ""My Weapon,"" and the band's experiments with atonality and noise are realized on tracks like ""Meccanic Dancing"" and ""Beatown,"" two rousing rockers; however, dull tracks like ""Super Tuff,"" ""Buzzcity Talking,"" and the excruciatingly boring ""Battery Brides,"" which is perhaps the only forgettable song written by Andy Partridge, fail to match anything on their debut album, ""White Music,"" a much more polished and groundbreaking collection of songs.XTC newbies ought to investigate the band's other albums first before taking a chance on this lukewarm offering that only the most devoted collectors should own."
3,"Sadly, nothing new...","I love Stephen Coonts for his fiction and for his compellations... ""Combat"" and ""Victory"" were excellent. This book lacks the redeeming trait of those tomes: new material. This is a collection of classics, but the selections from the modern authors- Coonts, Brown, and Peters- are all republished works, too. Granted, they are from wonderful novels themselves, but this collection would be that much better if there was some new material in it... pity.If you do like the selection from ""The War in 2020,"" buy some more of Ralph Peters' works; he is one of the most unappreciated thriller authors out there."
5,"Rusty said, ""Best NASCAR game ever created!""",Race 2001 season with 25 drivers on 19 tracks. 1-2 players or compete against 11 drivers in Race the Pro. Digital/Analog control; vibration function; touch sensitive.
4,the gamplay stunk,"the gamplay maid me cry!!!the graphics were fine and it was pretty easy,but you should be able to make a car or pick your avretisments,other than that it was an o.k game for me :]"
3,"Ok, but not great.","I bought this title based on the reviews I read here, but it wasn't as good as I'd hoped. I also bought Gran Turismo 3 along with it, so maybe I'm spoiled after playing it first. GT3 is the best racing sim availble at the time I'm typing this. If you're a diehard NASCAR fan you'll more than likely enjoy Nascar Heat 2002, despite the lackluster graphics and realism. However, don't expect to be knocked off your feet or anything."
3,ok if you like nascar games,i went out and bought this because i heard it was awesome. not the case. if you like nascar games buy nascar thunder. personally i am a drag racer and there is no drag racing games for ps2.
2,just like old ea games,"I went by the reviews and rented this game, lucky i didn't buy it, it's almost exactly like the old ea games, which are nothing, especially compared to the sierra computer games. I haven't played the 2002 ea game, so i can't say about it, but i'd say cart world series is the best playstation racing game. and it's so old you probably can't find it anymore."
3,maybe we should play the game before rating it???,"This game was a bit of a letdown for me. I was expecting tight control with updated paint schemes and all the tracks. The paint schemes are there, all the tracks are there i believe, save for Indy, the control is kinda iffy, i suppose it will take some getting used to, so i say 3 stars for now with potential for 4 or maybe 5, i cant stop playing Twisted Metal: Black long enough to give it a real chance, but at least i played it before trashing it. The whole point of NASCAR is to race the other drivers, rather than the track, hence the repetitive nature of NASCAR."
2,Pales in Comparison to Nascar Thunder!,"Sorry Racers, but bought this game on a whim, and paid dearly for it. Nascar Heat just can't measure up to the amount of playability, and realism that Nascar Thunder 2002 offers. You can't build your own car. You must race an established car, (sorry but what fun is bein the substitute driver??) I wanna be the STAR!! The head to head feature wasn't that impressive. Yeah great Kevin Harvick can beat me on his favorite track? I paid 20 bucks to find this out??The graphics looked washed out on my tv, and the car gets too squirelly in the corners. The music, and the intro is better then NT2002, but the spotter's voice is too garbled to understand clearly. Overall very disappointed with this game."
5,One of the best NASCAR games out there.,"This game is great! What can I say! I mean the graphics are the best I've ever seen on a nascar game. Sound is okay not over the top but not bad. Gameplay is fun and addictive, and the car is easy to control. Although I should warn you that steering may feel really sensitive at first, but you do get used to it so don't panic. Another reason the game is so great is that there is lots to do even after you beat the championship mode. For example there is race the pro and beat the heat modes. This is definetlty the best NASCAR game I've ever played and will definetly hold me over till Nascar 2002 comes out in October. !_!"
1,Play it before you rate it!!!,I happen to pre-order the Nascar Heat and once it arrives I will give a proper rating. I do know with what I have seen it does out perform the Electronic Arts version of the game. It may not be the PC Version like NASCAR 4 but I have had many friends come over during parties and they couldn't get enough of it...and that was Nascar 2001 by EA Sports. I will admit it is a better 2 player game.
5,This book is great!,"I read a theme in school about Beverly Cleary and we had to pick a Beverly Cleary book for a Book Report. I picked Ramona the Pest. I think I picked the best Beverly Cleary book out of them all. Some parts are hilarious. Others are kind of weird. Ramona is a girl who always goes around and teases people the way my little sister annoys me. If you have a little sister who annoys you, you will love this book."
4,Good children's book,its a great book for children and it is very good if you like to know what a sister rivalry is.
4,Read this book.,It was an excellent book. Anyone should read it. For all boys and girls. Ages 7-12. It was one of my favorite.
3,Lodi'm g,THIS WAS THE BEST BOOK EVER .My favorite character is Beezus . Also I am going to read more books of Ramona
5,In love with Ramona!,Had a love affair with Ramona when I was a child and am trying to push this love onto my students! I love the download but wish that I had purchased the real book to be able to share with my students.
4,It was really funny,You should read this book because it is funny. I read this book a long time ago (3 months) and I still can remember the funny parts.It is worth the price.
3,Ramana The Pest,"Ramana The Pest, by Beverly Cleary is a very interesting and funny book about a girl named Ramana trying to get through her kindergarden year. Ramana gets into all kinds of trouble, including having to sit on the bench at recess. The book is very entertaining and even a bit adventureous."
5,Ramona the Pest,"Everything was fine. The book was in excellent condition, I get it fast. I'm happy to make my purchase in here."
1,Be warned: Louis Darling's illustrations have been dumped,"I just received new copies of Beverly Cleary's books for my library. I realized that the dust jackets were different when I ordered them; I don't like it, but I've learned to live with that. Then I opened Ramona the Pest and realized that they've replaced Louis Darling's marvelous illustrations, with those wild, exuberant, inky pictures of a Ramona who practically leaps from the pages, with drab, dreary, bland, anodyne, pallid and uninteresting things. What an awful thing to do to wonderful books. (And I know all the arguments about ""Oh, children today are *different*, and they must have new new new pictures that look like everything else they've ever seen because otherwise they might not read the books..."" Bilge.)The story deserves five stars. I've removed four of them for crimes against illustration."
4,Ramona the Pest,"Ramona Quimby has started kindergarten and is learning new things each day. Ramona is not only learning how to write her name but is learning life lessons. She is also making new friends.I enjoyed the book because it was humorous. Ramona's reactions to her teacher and peers were funny. They reminded me about times when I was in grade school, such as girls chasing the boys they like or girls admiring other girls long hair. This a a great book for those who love humorous stories."
5,The 1st Book I read as a KID!,"This book is FUN FUN FUN!!! It was the first book I ever read and has changed my life ever since. I made me want to READ! I loved Ramona because I identified with her as a kid! From the strange substitute teacher incident, to the PEST I was around ""grownups""! Good family reading! :)"
5,Great Book; Great Recording,"Other reviewers have said that this book is a beloved masterpiece of children's fiction, which it is. I'd just like to add that Stockard Channing's unabridged recordings of it, and the other Ramona books, do justice to them completely.Channing is magnificent; like Cleary, she captures Ramona without ever patronizing her. The tapes stand up to repeated listening, which you can expect, without becoming precious or annoying. I'd like to see CD editions of these recordings become available."
1,bad choice,"I remember reading this as a little girl, as a mom, BAD CHOICE!! Ramona is NOT the type of girl I want my girls to follow after!! She is so naughty & even says ""GOD can't make her mind"".tossed it in the trash :("
5,Ramona is Ageless,"Ramona is five and couldn't be more excited about Kindergarten. However, Ramona finds herself in trouble more than once, what with the problems with Susan's curls and the substitute. Nevertheless, Ramona is a spunky little girl who is hard to believe isn't real.I've been reading Ramona since I was little and I continue to read them now. Ramona and her family are ageless and apply to kids now, no matter how old the books become. The great thing about the Ramona books is that they are very enjoyable for parents as well, so they make good books to read to the kids."
5,Excellent for Children of All Ages!,"This is a wonderful book! I read it to my class of second graders, as a read aloud every school year. Even though the protagonist in the story is a little kindergarten girl. The ""aged"" 7 year olds in my class still love it! They seem to really identify with this character... who am I kidding I identify with her too!Who among us has never felt excited about a shiny new pair of boots... or some other piece of clothing?Who among us has not felt embarrassed when we mistake a song lyric?Who among us has not been swept up in the moment wanting to squish, squish, squish in fresh mud?Ramona, just like you has experienced all this and more. This book in Beverly Cleary's Ramona series, is full of priceless childhood moments. In fact it is not difficult to picture our own selves in all these moments.Ramona is a priceless kid... and this book is full of priceless moments of childhood reflection.Adults to Kids should exerience this one. It is well worth your time."
1,not even 3D can save this movie,"Meh. It's boring. The gore is weak, the zombies aren't impressive in the least, the acting is abominable even for B-movie fare, the stories aren't interesting at all. There's just nothing here. I saw the 3D version, and some of the interesting little 3D bits were the only good thing at all. But a few cool 3D shots are not near enough to save a movie. Not at all. Just avoid this one. The only reason my friend picked it up is because we're major zombie fans. And we were sorely disappointed. Sigh."
2,Doesn't work with 32' Samsung,"Bought unit for my 32"" Samsung hdtv. This wall mount did not fit my tv. I tried doing research to see if it would fit prior, even wen to their website, didn't see a list of compatible tvs. Seems like a decent wall mount but is probably better for smaller televisions."
3,Sticks out from wall more than expected.,"Bought the mount for Vizio 26"" and fits fine. Mount does stick out from wall more that I expected. This distance is not included in the description. Its around 2"" which is a fairly large gap for this type mount. It has to be this thick due to the tilt feature. Just thought this info should have been included in the description."
2,not enough,"I was disappointed because it was too short, about 25mn of video time so not worth the money and I could not find adequate information about Tuscany in the DVD."
1,I can't rate this film because....,"It is way over priced for the 26 minutes of documentary rather than actual back roads, you get a montage of crafts etc. along the way. The sound track was all static and sound quality poor. I am sending it back."
1,Complete Waste of Paper - Page Filler - Shame Shame Shame!,"I was looking for a good analysis of Tootsie. The author gives a few pages of one liner analysis, then 10 pages of long list of single words, double spaced, then another 20 pages of repeatitive pointing out the obvious. Some of the pages are blank. Poor presented. Zero value. Shame on the author and the publisher."
1,Ringbinder nonsense,"The childlike binding is the first giveaway that what's inside is a very basic cocept - cause and effect, if then else.... That's not to say that the original book it derives from isn't any good - because it is - and someone did have to analyse these films and put the information into a coherent format...BUT...the book even dared to use some long dead literary officionado's name in the same sentence as Aristotle's...and lo and behold his old books have shot up in price, literally thousands of pages of obscure nonsense that no-one needs to know about.Ultimately, this is a basic book - in every respect."
5,Simply the best,"This product is the strongest massager I've ever used.It's a little heavy and big for small hands, but the effect is very nice."
3,Just for fun,"It's not something you will listen to over and over, but just for fun it's good. I prefer the Ayre Brandon CD, but sometimes this one is so cheap on Amazon it's worth it."
3,"Good ideas, but short on examples","After purchasing Zingerman's Guide to Good Eating, a wonderfully informative book about cheese, bread, olive oil, chocolate and many other artisan foods, I had high hopes for this book. On the positive side, it contains many excellent ideas on providing truly distinguished customer service, which are presented in a succinct, easy-to-read style. However, this book would have been more compelling if the author had illustrated these ideas with specific examples of how Zingerman's staff have provided superior service to customers or how they have handled difficult or unusual situations with customers. On the very last page of the book, Mr. Weinzweig writes: ""Tell service stories. The knowledge of things that staffers do to provide guests with great service needs to be shared. People like to hear stories."" Too bad that he didn't take his own advice when putting this book together."
5,Customer Service Hero,"All I have to say is that this book teaches all there is to know about customer service: the customer is your business. Once you accept, embrace, and get ecstatic about that...everything about your company will skyrocket!"
4,Good and simple approach to customer service,Easy to read with good examples. Aftr reading I bought additional copies for all my managers.
3,Not Just The Guitars on this disc,"Fresh from Tight Spot Records, The vocals screeched past my eardrums and riveted my brainstem for the entire length of the album. With a ghostly translucent background ""Guests Of The Nation"" is very unpredictable, and leaves the listener demure in an unexpected flurry of musical directions that bombard with banjo and truly ambient weirdness. Touches of surf-rock on the lead guitar appear on the more upbeat tracks with a very light tremolo, and ""It's Just a S5!tty Guitar"" is amusing if nothing else. Fivehead consists of John hunt on guitars, vocals, banjo and bass, Beaty Wilson on Vocals, guitars, Keys and glock, Jeff Jones on bass and guitars, and Davis Comeau on drums. Check out Fivehead's interactive website at: www.fiveheadmusic.com - Brett Lemke"
3,"Cyborg Born, Cyborg Bred, And Cyborg Dead.","In the not so distant future, humanity is challenged by it's own totalitarian tendencies. Evil is present in the form of a ruthless government not concerned with the well-being of the people, but in maintaining their power. To achieve this aim, they have developed a breed of cyborgs to maintain order at any cost and squash the underground resistance. The Resistance has developed an embryo that can perhaps match the strength and intelligence of these cyborgs, but it's up to a woman, Mary, and a man with a mysterious past, Austin, to ensure that this hope for the future is safe from a cyborg that stalks their every step as they move from one Resistance laboratory to another. Watch as Austin discovers his dark secret and must move toward a self-realization, and new vision of humanity."
1,"Don't. Seriously, don't.","Oh, so very bad. Not ""good"" bad, but rather ""bad"" bad. There's no accounting for taste, though, so I will say that if you really liked ""Battlefield Earth"" it's worth giving this a shot."
1,Never seen it...,"And now I can't because ""a viewer"" below ruined it. Thanks chowderhead. Hey amazon don't be bananaheads and post spoilers... bananahands."
3,Partied Out,"There is always a chance when a artist who has made some good rap songs, can always lose his vibe. That surprisingly has happened to Will Smith. Arguably, for a great rapper his latest single, has a much harder and darker vibe than before. Party Starter, the second single from his Lost & Found record, isn't really one of the best songs I've heard from Will. The song has a fairly deep vibe, but it just doesn't actually make it over the top. I really didn't like the song at all that much. The song isn't as great as his previous single, Switch, but for anybody who hasn't heard this track, listen to it and party start it yourself.Song: C-"
3,Short and sweet,"I like this wine rack, but check your measurements - this is REALLY small and not exactly what I was hoping for. Also, I can't have wine bottles in the upper wine rack portion at the same time as I hang wine glasses because there isn't enough headroom there to accommodate both."
4,Sufficient,"This wine rack is cute and it meets its intended purpose. I purchased two to serve as both a wine rack and table.The pros:It is very easy to assemble. It takes all of 15 minutes to assemble.It has slots for wine glasses.It has enough space on its top for a glass, plate, and remote control:-)The cons:The wood pieces used to disguise or cover the screw head do not stay in place. All eight are on the floor."
4,Pretty Fantastic!,"I gave this a 4 star rating because I can't fit my wide based wine glasses in it, I had to buy new glasses to fit in it. Which was no big deal, because I needed new wine glasses anyways, but if you have wine glasses you love then that doesn't help. Plus when I have all the wine glasses in it I can't put wine bottles on the top rack. But considering the price and what I need it for I love it."
2,"Missing screws, delivered to wrong house","Ok this was my first buy on amazon.. I bought 2 of the Tripp Lite TMC-6 TouchMaster Compact Surge Suppressor.. My nabor came to me and Gave me the box that was shipped. She found it at her front door, 2 houses up the street!(UPS can't read an address) When I took out the 2 switch boxes, 1 didn't have any screws in it (a friday special?)I needed them bad so I put my own screws in it.. so far they are working fine.. Not very pleased with my first buy from here..Oh and a week Later there 20 bucks now insted of 30."
3,"It does the job, but...","I was actually looking for a Belkin under-the-monitor surge protector just like the one I already have, but they don't make it anymore. I settled on the Tripp-Lite because it was the only other product I could find that came anywhere near what I wanted. I would prefer that the push buttons on front be toggle switches, like the old Belkin model has. My Belkin on the whole and in every aspect is superior to the Tripp Lite version, but this one will have to do. So far it's performing OK, and I guess that's the important part."
2,Did the job - then it died.,Even tho the seller shipped me a used one instead of new - it still does the job just fine. Not too keen on the buttons (prefer toggle style switches). No problems so far.Update - the product completely died 7 months later.
3,PC Monitor Surge Protector,"Works well but made out of plastic. Looks a little cheap. Would look better if it was metal. Other than that, I does what it supposed to do."
5,Excellent,"Searched for this handy item for a long time. Happy when I found it to be affordable. Delvery was immediate, price was good and I'm delighted I found it. Just what I wanted."
3,Platform Surge Protector,This is the third one I have had. They perform as advertised. However this is the 2nd time the master switch has broken and it is not a home repair. I have written to get information regarding the warranty and after several weeks have still had no response.
2,Was sent a used item,"The item I was sent arrived in an open box and appears to have been used previously. There are scratches along the sides, especially near the outlets."
3,I got a Lemmon,"I bought this product not from Amazon but from one of their sub vendors, i got it home plugged everything in and it worked fine, untill i placed my monitor on top of it, if i put my monitor too close to the top right side of the protector it shuts off everything and sometimes if i bump it by mistake it shuts off everything i wanted to return it but i lost the invoice :( just my rotten luck"
5,Terrific Product,"This makes it very easy to manage all the peripherals I need with my computer. It is getting harder to find these under monitor power commanders, and I am really glad you had them."
5,Tripp Lite Compact Surge Supressor,"I have other Tripp Lite product so my expectations for this Compact Surge Suppressor were high. I was not disappointed. Its compact dimensions of 11 1/4"" square by 1 3/4"" thick are the perfect size for the pedestal footprint of my new 22"" Samsung LCD monitor. The push buttons directly below the LED lights make it simple to turn on or off the various switches in a darkened room. The large equipment burn-out policy Tripp Lite supplies with this suppressor is a welcome perk.Amazon got this suppressor to me rapidly and well packaged. I was using it within minutes of receipt and expect it to last for years."
2,Tripp Lite Needs Help,"I was pleased to get the protector as I wanted a surge protector in my system. It was very easy to install. However when I turned it on I noticed that the monitoring lights for the individual switches did not work. In the booklet it suggested that you call Tripp Lite to get support. I called and told them of my problem and I was told that I would get a replacement unit within five days. After waiting a week, I called back Tripp Lite and asked what happened to my replacement unit. I was told that the unit was not shipped until a day or two before. They did not know why this happened. I got the impression that they really didn't care why. Because of this, I would not recommend Tripp Lite to anyone. I guess as an after thought, I should have called Amazon and they would have taken care of this in a timely fashion."
1,piece of garbage,"this thing was an absolute cheap piece of junk. Not a single outlet worked. The lights on the front intermittently lit up, so at least that did show that the unit was getting power from my outlet. The re-set button on the back didn't work. It was cheap, thin plastic that wouldn't hold up even if it did work at all when I received it. I just threw it away. Wasn't worth the effort to repack and send back and wait for a refund, which is probably what they are counting on. Tripp makes a product that costs about .25cents, sells it for $30 and if only half the people bother to return it (which would be a high number since most don't) they still make a ton."
2,Fine if you don't use much power...,"Convenient, small and easy to use. Fine if you don't use too much power or have a LCD monitor.Too bad Tripp-Lite is too cheap to make them out of metal. The amount of power that my laser printer uses causes my top of the line Sony monitor and my cheap Dell rebrand to shimmer. The flow of electricity causes a magnetic field to interfere with the electron gun. If they still made these things out of metal it would reduce or stop the interference. I am now trying to get my old APC metal one repaired."
4,A hard-to-find replacement,I was somewhat surprised that the surge protector did not have a designted control switch for the computer. I cannot see why this feature was excluded.
4,Great product!,"When my old surge protector died, I purchased this one. it works perfectly! It is nice to know I still can get a surge protector for an old fossil of a computer."
2,Attractive product and features but...,"Received the surge protector promptly and well packaged with detailed instructions. I was surprised to find that an outlet switch labelled ""monitor"" does not work. For the price, I'm keeping it but am disappointed with the quality control testing on this item. I hope that this is the only defect.All of the other features work as advertised and I really like the design."
2,Tripp lite,"The first thing that i wont to say is took way to long for the order to be processed. Next is the shipping took what seamed like i was living in the 1970. Received the package and it was packed well. Moving on, made out of cheep plastic, but looks good. Also remember you do get what you pay for."
1,Computer Surge Protector,"Purchased the unit to turn off my computer system. Which consists of a computer, monitor, printer, camera, & audio sound amplifier.Unit worked as planned for a short time then the main shutoff push on-off master switch stopped working. Previously I had a surge protector for 25 years with no problems then I purchased this one as an replacement. This one fits nicely under my viewing monitor but the master push button does not shut down my system as it was designed to do. I bought two units one still works and one doesn't."
4,Tripp Lite TMC surge protector,I had looked and could not find this product at various stores. I wanted to replace a simliar product which stopped working after many years. I like the covenience of being able to control the power to each peripheral without haveing to look under desk. The most important fact is the surge protection.
5,Live at McCabes,"What can I say, one of the all time benchmark flatpicking albums of all time. An absolute must have for any aspiring or veteran guitar player who enjoys this genre....This album changed my musical mindset as a serious guitarist when it first came out in 1976. I put my Les Paul down and picked up a D 18....still going strong."
1,Good-looking but poor performance,"We bought the Crosley Songwriter in October of last year at Linens 'n Things.The remote didn't work, but Customer Service at Crosley sent a new one, which worked fine.As a fourth-grade teacher, I have many cassettes that I want to record onto CDs (stories from the reading series, old books-on-tape), so I used it to copy these over. All seven of the CDs I made worked wonderfully. Transferring albums was equally easy, although I only did one. In both cases, the most difficult part was being present to press the button that manually splits tracks.After a month of use, however, the CD player would only play part of a CD--three songs--and then it would quit, locking up the unit. Powering off and back on freed up the unit, but didn't solve the problem. We have since returned the Songwriter to Linens 'n Things for a full refund. This is a great idea in an attractive package that just doesn't work."
3,Customer Service doesn't exist,"I was having issues with not being able to Finalize a CD once it had been recorded. Without that step, you can't listen to the CD on any other machine. I sent Crosley 4-5 emails and NEVER received a response. I was ready to return the machine, but was finally able to get a few CDs to work. I was using 80 min. blank CDs, but found if you get too close to using all 80 minutes, the CD won't finalize. So I now leave several minutes 'blank' to accomodate the machine.It's easy to use - I like that aspect. But if there is an issue with it, don't count on Crosley to help you out."
1,Big disappoinment!,"A great idea , but don't buy it. Listening to good quality stereo LP's is a dreadful experience. The speakers are so poor, and worse yet, that quality carries through to the CD burner. The CD's I produced are so bad I can't listen to them. When using the cassette player to make CD's, the sound is muffled, and you can hear the hiss and the turning of the tape reproduced on the CD! I am boxing it up, and returning it."
2,Songwriter,"The first machine that arrived was visibly used and I purchased a new one. The main reason I purchased the machine was to record to CD from my collection of vinyl records. The first attempt to record - it failed! I tried again and the same thing. I called the company and they told me to try again and if it failed to contact where I purchased it and return it. In the whole process, at least six cd were ruined and I ended up returning it. The replacement I got has not malfunctioned as of yet, but needless to say, I don't know how long it will continue to work."
2,Crosley songwriter lacks quality control,"The songwriter arrived inoperable. Crosley tech support told me to return to seller. The seller did not have another in stock, so I ordered from a different seller. This one also arrived inoperable. The 3rd one arrived with only a missing stylus; Crosley tech support is sending me a new stylus, and I believe this will solve the problem...but as of this date the product still does not work.Either I am jinxed, or quality control at Crosley stinks.The seller was excellent. the machine arrived very quickly; and they processed the return and credit promptly and without hassle. I will definitely buy from them in the future. The seller gets 5 stars...the product 1 star."
1,What a waste of money,"I looked forward to getting this so that I might transfer all my LPS to CDs. I did, fairly easily, but the quality of the finished product was horrible. I could listen to my LPS fairly painlessly, kept meaning to hook up another speaker, but I have now discovered that the CD drawer no longer opens, nor does the turntable turn. So, I guess I'll throw it out. This was way too expensive to end up like this."
1,Greatly disappointed,"I was very enthusiastic to receive this recorder for Christmas, but, after spending at least eight hours trying to record one LP record on CD, I have given up and am going to return it for a refund."
2,In satisfied customer,I was very excited about this product but after I received it I noticed it was used when I sent it back for a new one I ended up with the same product. Crosley is not customer friendly. I thought crosley was a reputable company. If I wanted a used product I would have tried eBay.
4,great sound...poor visuals,"This does everything promised...it's fault is a visual one. It's very difficult to read the imprinted words above the buttons on the front panel. I made a small ""cue"" index card that I use to guide my choice...sorry I know I should be able to memorize them all but just too much stuff stored at this point."
3,Crosley CR248 Songwriter CD Recorder - Oak,Beautiful piece of history. Not reall good if you wish to copy cassette to cd's.
1,crosley crap,"I was very disappointed with my purchase.the record player doesnt play very clear. and the tapes were clear,then the tape player wasnt eatting them. I would not recommend spending all that $$ for something i think is not that good."
4,Noisy but it does the job,"After reading some of the reviews, I was nervous. But the Crosley does what it says it will do with simple directions. Yes, it is noisy when you burn a CD but I can live with it."
3,Cassette Recorder,So far everything has been just fine except the inability to finalise a couple of discs. The print on the front of the unit is very difficult to read.
2,Major Wear and Tear On Your Records,"This turntable and most if not all the Crosley's turntables are overpriced for what it gives you. First off, the sound quality is not very good and the tone arm does not have a weight control to prevent the stylus from severely damaging your ablums if accidently kicked or knocked. Also without weight control on the tone arm, more pressure is applied on the sound groves and your albums won't last very long. You can definitely get a better deal for a turntable equipted with tone arm weight control so the stylus will ease up your fine albums and still give you excellent sound quality."
4,"Very pleased, overall.","This item was purchased as a gift for a friend / co-worker who was retiring. Had a lot of old, one-of-a-kind albums, and we thought this would be the perfect gift for him. I was concerned because of poor reviews, but found out that the ones manufactured now (since April 2007) are considered 'second generation' -- more reliable and trouble-free than the earlier ones. The recipient of this one is extremely pleased to be able to put his older, over-played albums in CD format. Easy to use, other than having to insert breaks between songs. I've listened to a couple of the CDs he's made, and was surprised at the decent sound quality, especially considering the music source. After talking with him and listening to these CD copies, my fears about this product have been releived. I am now considering buying another one ... for myself."
2,almost.........,This is a great idea for all of us with vinyl and tape to convert to CD. It worked great for about 6 cds then became very inconsistant. Only half of the display was visible. Shortly it stopped playing any cd. Can't recommend it.
2,"Easy to use, but that's about it","I bought this item because I have serious amounts of vinyl and old cassettes I wanted to digitize.Sad to say, I started with the cassettes. For that purpose, this device excels. I digitized about 100 old (mostly spoken-word) cassettes.By that time, I was no longer able to return it; and when the first LPs came out sounding tinny and slightly fast, I found myself seriously wishing I could do so.I must say, this device was a snap to use. The reviews that refer to the controls as confusing may reflect a lack of willingness to RTFM (which I'll admit could be a bit better-written). It's well-constructed and sounds at least average.If you have *lots* of tape (comedy, books-on-tape, radio programs), and you're not particularly tech-prone (read: computer-savvy), this device may be worth it. If, on the other hand, your main goal is digitizing LPs, I'd recommend you pass."
2,disappointed,"I was very disappointed with the whole experience. Firstly, the machine never worked and also the accompanying directions and brochure was most inadequate and very poorly written.Furthermore, it took great effort and persistence to finally return the songwriter for another machine.I hope my next experience is not as trying!"
4,Good recordings,"Some of the other reviewers of this product were less than happy with the quality of the product, or the sound of phonograph records or other media formats. Well, yeah, it doesn't sound all that great compared with other systems...but the buyer should already have something better for listening. As a recording device, it was pretty good, and that's why I bought the Crosley...to transfer old cassettes and records to the CD format for preservation purposes. It worked fine. I thought the design of the front panel was a overly complex and hard to read, but I got used to it. Crosley might have added a VU meter and adjustment to the recorder, but that would have jacked up the cost. All in all, and for the recording purpose, it's a pretty good tool. The object CD-Rs sound just like the original cassettes and records."
3,Crosley CR248,Used the Crosley CR248 Songwriter to record 33rpm albums to CD. Works pretty much as advertized and as per instructions in the owners manual. The one problem I have with the unit is after recording a CD during play back there is a audible noise in the backround. With most selections it isn't too noticeable but on recording with quiet or soft music it is very noticeable. The two records I have recorded so far are in pristine condition with no scratches and no backround noise when played while not recording to CD.
2,Not worth the money.,"I bought this piece of junk a year ago. I ended up giving it to a friend,who ended up throwing it in the garbage.1. The cassette player always played the tape faster than what it should have. Always sounded like I was like I was listening to the chipmunks.2. The cd recorder always left off the first few seconds of the song if I pushed split track.3. It didn't matter what remote I was using. It would end up turning on. If I had a cd left in the tray it would start playing. The volume starts out at 15 every time you turn on the unit. I was startled a few times.4. When I would try to put the arm of the turntable on a record. The whole turntable would move around like it wasn't being held in place.I have another Crosley that I paid $99.00 for and doesn't have anything fancy on it. But it is way better than this junk."
1,"Crosley recoreders are junk ""DO NOT BUY THEM""","I bought the Crosley recorder last year at Christmas and used it (3) times and the cassette player quit working...sent it back for a new one and then the power button would not work....just got a new one again for the third time and now this power button doesn't work you have to use the remote control only to use it....junk,junk,junk!!!!!!!! Never again will I purchase one of these and they should pull them all off the market since they are getting such bad reviews and everyone has problems with them......"
2,This really is kids' stuff.,"I bought this because I wanted something with which to listen to my vinyl and which could be put in a home office. And while I was at it, record that vinyl to CD. However, it has all the fidelity of a AM transistor radio from the 70's, and while the resulting CDs sound good on a different system than when the vinyl is played, the CD recording process requires you to sit by the machine in order to manually enter the track breaks and to stop the recording process manually. So I find myself recording sides of an LP or cassette onto a CD/RW disc, ripping those onto my PC and using some MP3/WMA editing software that allows me to split the tracks manually and drop the silent space at the end where the record ended, but I was in the bathroom. So now I'm scratching my head thinking I should just put all the money this costs into a USB turntable and some software that automatically does track splits and noise removal. I definitely do not recommend."
2,Crosley Radio CR248 Songwriter CD Recorder,"The Crosley Radio CR248 Songwriter CD recorder is great when it works. However, after 2 weeks, I had to return it for repairs. The tape cassette did not work and I couldn't record anything onto the CD. It is now at the shop. I had to call twice to get them to give me a return authorization and there was no indication in the packaging telling me to contact Best in Home, the place that shipped it to me. Best in Home contacted me and told me they would have replaced the whole unit free of charge, but that was after I had already sent it to Crosley."
4,Crosley Songwriter,"This item works well right out of the box. I bought it to move my album & cassette collections to cd. Very easy to use. The one problem is that if you want each song to be a seperate track, you have to sit and manually close each track. It is very time consuming! I could do that by ripping the entire side to my computer and manually splitting it there...but that adds additional time too. The sound is OK but not exceptional. For those who aren't fussy and can move a complete side of an album or cassette without worrying about splitting tracks...this will work very well."
5,Crosley Songwriter Great!,"The Crosley CR248 Songwriter CD Recorder is an excellent value. It is very easy to operate and use. I have many old records (78's, 33 1/3's and 45's)and cassette tapes and this machine is exactly what I needed to perserve my collection. Play your record or cassette and press the record button and that's it. You can stop and restart recording at anytime. You can create your own albums on CD from your single records. The sound is very good for an all-in-one stereo. It is a large, beautiful piece of furniture and you will need to find a table top or record cabinet to place it on. I have really enjoyed this unit. I highly recommend it."
1,No Croslely customer service - product does not work,"Received as a Christmas gift. It came from JC Penny so I had no problem returning it. The albums worked okay but the 45rpm records did not. I never tried the cassette. The turntable seemed to be warpped which was very noticable on the 45rpm records. Also on most of the 45's the stylus would come up before the record ended and return to its rest position, resulting in not getting the complete song. I called Crosley on Dec. 31, 2008. I was told someone would call me back in 48-72 business hours. (No holidays or weekends.) It is now January 24, 2009 and I never did hear from them. Luckily the item has been returned and I have my money back. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Disappointed,"I bought the Crosley Songwriter CD Recorder because I wanted all of its functions in one piece of equipment that was fairly small. However, I did not think the CD sound was very good and the FM radio was full of static. I did not put up the hang-up antenna because I wouldn't want that thing hanging on my wall. Also the AM was not very clear and the directions said to turn the player around until it was good. No thanks! I did not try the record player. I had had enough."
1,RUSS,I DON'T LIKE THE CONTROLS. THEY SHOULD BE LIT UP. I HAD TO USE A FLASH LIGHT TO SEE THE DIFFERENT CONTROL BUTTON. I STARTED TO MAKE CD'S FROM CASETTES. AFTER AN HOUR THE MACHINE STOPPED RECORDING. I AM IN THE PROCESS OF RETURNING THIS UNIT. I WISH IT LASTED LONGER. RUSS
1,Heavy heavy oil.,These are the oiliest kippers I have ever eaten. I have a hard time digesting oil and these actually made me ill. They tasted OK but not worth the oil.
5,John West Kipper - Sale,Please have another sale of John West kippers. They were fantastic and I will stock up next time Amazon has this offer. I only bought one case and regret not having bought more at the sale price.
3,Merely Average,"This movie wasn't as good as people made it out to be. Most of the funnier parts are ruined in the previews. Regardless, there are a few places to make you laugh. I don't think the outakes are very funny. He's an idea to remember; an outake isn't in the original film since it wasn't funny enough to be there in the first place. I would suggest a rental."
1,2 + 2 =,"If you're able to solve the above math problem, you're too intelligent for this movie. This video is classified as a ""comedy"", but it's not really that funny; it's more disgusting and sickening than funny. This story about a nerdish male (Ben Stiller) who searches for his long lost high school prom date (Cameron Diaz) is chock-full of nonsensical adult-themed characters and situations that only people with an IQ of an earthworm would enjoy and appreciate. Even a rental fee for this video would be a waste of money."
4,A Classicly Fun Movie you Won't Forget,I saw this long ago but wanted my sister and husband to see it -They had a good laugh and will enjoy this movie for a long time to come...
5,The funniest movie ever!!!!!,"It is by far the funniest movie I have ever seen. I do not usually go for those kind of movies, but Mary was hilarious. I was constantly surprised by the next story plot. You can't even describe the story to anyone, because they won't get it. It is definately a ""must see"" as long as you are an adult."
5,LOL (hair gel) he he,what a funny film cameron diaz(the mask) just gives a great profomace and ben stiller(mystery men & heavey weights) also matt dillon (WILD THINGS & IN&OUT) make this movie the #1 one hit of 98 for a movie with simularitys and the same wild humor see american pie i give something about mary 5 BIG STARS
4,great,THis movie is one of the best comedies of the 90's. there is great laughs and well timed humor in this movie and I suggest this movie to everyone.
1,there's something about Mary,"Dear Sirs,It is 5 days I am trying to rent this movie but it doesn't work. I have been using your instant videos for over a year and never had a single issue. It seems that you have mayor problem with this movie. Please check and refer.Best regards"
1,"This Was Pathetic, a Complete Waste of Time","This movie wins the prize for the stupidest movie I've seen in a long time. It's petty, pointless, and worst of all, not really funny. This movie is a perfect illustration of Hollywood going after the buck instead of considering what really makes a good movie.Don't get me wrong, I like comedies as much as anyone. We all need a break from time to time. This picture is just adolescent in every worst way possible.I should have just gone to the garage and beaten myself with a hammer. I would have had less of a headache than I did after watching this waste of film and money.It is hard to even come up with a suggestion as far as a better movie. Just about anything would fit that category."
1,If you are into vulger & gross....,"Was terribly gross, vulger and so so very predictable. Everyone thought this movie was so funny and I was looking forward to seeing it. Instead it was a big waste of money. I do not think I laughed once, maybe just cringed now and then."
2,"There's Nothing About Mary, or Much Ado About Nothing",I began to wonder what else was on television about midway through this movie. Gimmicky and predictable.
2,"Horrible, some funny parts","Not very funny, went to the movies thinking it was going to be hilarious from what the previews looked like but iwas misss led. Waste of money! Stupid plot with only the occasional funny part mainly the part with the dog attackin Ben Stiller. Don't recommend it, the age group that would most likely enjoy this is 13 - 15 year olds. Too tupid for adults and to rude for younger kids."
1,What a Waste of Film,"To sum up the entire movie I would say ""Male body humor"". I did not find this movie funny at all. I thought the acting was terrible and every scene had a disgusting twist."
5,Really good!,"I finally watched this film, and boy did I love it. I can't see why people criticize this film as much as they do. It is not supposed to be viewed with such a critical eye, it is just meant to be viewed and enjoyed. In addition to being a hilarious comedy, it is also has a series of neat plot twists. Nobody can accuse this of being a predictable film. It is anything but predictable. It is in fact, a superb film, with a great cast."
4,"I wasn't too sure, then I watched","Yes, it's juvenile but it's fun and funny. If you get Ben Stiller, you'll love this movie. It is a pop-cult hit."
5,One of the funniest movies I have ever seen.,"Great, funny movie. Great characters, lines and acting. Laughed all the way thru it. As funny the 2nd and 3rd time seeing."
5,GREAT MOVIE,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. I laughed pretty much all the way through it. My hat is off to the person who wrote the scenes,where the dog went out the window. The bathroom humor at the beginning of the movie was great also, almost as good as American Pie, which I also recomend."
4,It was absolutely hilarious!!,"This film made me laugh so much that just seeing the cover of the video and reading other viewer comments reminded me of some of the crazy scenes in the movie like the dog scene, those stupid musicians and i started laughing all over again!! Guess what, I am still laughing as i write this!!"
5,I Slapped My Knee Red!,This is hands down the funniest movie ever made. Ben Stiller is finally getting the respect he's deserved for years!
3,Cute movie,"This was a ok movie, thought it was a little corny. But some parts are real funny. I think it's a chick flick movie."
3,"Looks good, not what i expected. 16th april 2004.","I watched it and it was nothing like what i had got in mind. I never expected it to be like this, it is quite boring to watch. It may look good by the box, its watchable but not brilliant."
1,Beware,"Watchout for any braindead friend you have that will never stop telling you that this is the 'greatest' comedy of all time. In actuality it's pretty lame. I could have very well lived a full and happy life without seeing this movie that takes it so-so jokes and tries to ram them down your throat. It's got a few chuckles, but for the most part you just wait patiently for it to end."
1,They must've pumped laughing gas into the theaters,"I love a good gross-out comedy with a big dose of slapstick thrown in. This was not one of those movies. I honestly don't understand the popularity of this movie. Don't buy this, buy ""Blazing Saddles"" or one of the ""Naked Gun"" movies. It's a shame we can't give ""Negative Stars"" to this movie. I am still angry that I wasted a couple of hours of my life that I can't get back."
5,Very funny and the whole cast is great,"I thought the ""hair gel"" part was hilarious. Also the infamous ""zipper incident"". This is the comedy to see."
5,Buenisima!!!,"Esta es una comedia con situaciones muy comicas,es muy buena para verla en grupo y pasar un buen rato."
2,Weak-minded humor with few laughs,"Some professional friends that I work with said that this was one of the best and funniest movies they had ever seen. It's depressing to think sometimes how dumbed down our pop culture has become. Yes, there were some laughs here and there, but the filmmakers' insistance that crude and tasteless is funny only goes to show how much wit and inspiration is missing from most comedies nowadays. People like Chaplin and the Marx Bros., who helped to define movie comedy, would be outraged to see what their art has evolved into. I guess my opinion is in the minority though, since I understand this film became a big hit. That's more scary than funny."
1,why waste your money,"Why waste your money on renting this movie? All you have to do is watch the trailer. There are no funny moments outside of the trailer. And why does America have this fascination with Ben Stiller. Everyone of his movies, especially Reality Bites, stinks. Hey Ben your dad is 10 times funnier than you and even he is not funny. And Cameron Diaz is one of the homliest actresses around."
1,Cat,"If you can read and/or spell the word above, you're too smart for this movie. Boring, moronic, and (worst of all), not funny."
2,i'z want to say i like itz..but i can't,i really wntas to say iz liked this movie. but i just didn't laugh enough. i the i thoughtz waz OK. I'vez seen much funny movies.......like anything by adams aandler..or the original kings of comedy. but this movie is sorta stupid. itz nbot as funny wants to say it is.. people are over doing it with this one....word!
2,Not sure why everyone thinks there is anything about Mary,"Trust me, I am a fan of raunchy rumor just like the rest of us. I rented this movie with great anticipation after hearing about how great the movie is, and was really disappointed. I thought it was just obnoxious, not funny. Am I supposed to laugh because the girl put the ""hair-gel"" in her hair? Give me a break."
3,Something about Mary,Box was a little dirty a little sticky. I know its used but should at least try to make it look nice.
4,This could have been a GREAT movie instead of just very good,"I laughed as hard as anyone else when I first saw this film, so hard that at first I was able to overlook what was missing. Only later did I realize where the movie missed its mark; there was very little social commentary, an error makes the movie merely fluff instead of one of the best comedies of all time.Let's face it. Every single one of Mary's suitors is a stalker. At a time where sound bites are confused with political leadership and ""Titanic"" confused with entertainment, this film could have made a powerful point on the confusion between love and obsession without sacrificing its hilarious, tasteless humor.It's so rare, however, for a movie to consciously cross every bound of good taste and do so with a good heart and a broad audience appeal. You *will* laugh out loud, but you'll also wish the movie had had the courage to go that last step."
3,Not nearly as good as I remembered,Not nearly as good as I remembered. Wouldn't rent it again. Meet the parents is much better with Ben stiller
2,A sweet love story wrapped in a series of nonsense situation,"The leads in this film are charismatic and believable, but they deserve better than acting out a serious of rediculous situations. The laughs were stricly ""high school"" and distracted from the sweet love story that was going on inbetween silly jokes. Some of the jokes were beyond silly, bordering on sick. A ""Daytona Beach Party Crowd"" will love this movie, but serious movie fans would like to be warned to stay away from this 'camp fair'."
4,Crude Humor at it's best!,"One of the funniest comedies of the 90's. Cameron Diaz is great as Mary, the subject of many men's dream. Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon are also great. But the real star of the movie are the Farrelly brothers who bring their own unique style of comedy into the 'High-school crush' story. It also has some really tender and knowing romantic scenes. The 'Puffy' and 'Hair Gel' scenes are bound to become classic. While the humor is crude; not recommended for those under 10 or those easily insulted, it is undeniably funny and ultimately kind-hearted. Entertaining and Hilarious. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"
5,One of the greatest comedies ever!,"In order to enjoy this movie you must be relaxed and open minded, or you can find this movie dissapointing, it can be either great or awful, depending on your mood."
4,Hilarious!,"The first time you see this movie, you will laugh until your gums bleed. The Farrelly brothers have supplied us with a great comedy that would even make your grandmother laugh. You will for sure enjoy it the first time you see it but upon viewing it again, you'll have known what is about to happen and may not laugh as hard. This is not the type of film that you can watch over and over again expecting to be satisfied. Ben Stiller's best role and this contins as well the best ensemble cast for a comedy in years. The DVD was somewhat disappointing, but it was put on the market a long time ago. The Outtakes are pretty funny, the cast/crew info is terrible and the trailer and film are good. I Recoomend Me, Myself & Irene if you loved this movie."
1,Save your money!,"Even a rental fee is a waste of money with this video. If you insist on seeing it to perhaps quench your curiosity, wait until it comes on one of the cable channels. A senseless, inconsistent tale of a nerdish male searching for his long-lost high school sweetheart with a lot of tasteless, adult humor thrown in. I hope the key players in this film eventually land decent movie roles in the future that add some kind of distinction to their careers."
1,"Fat drunk and stupid is no way to go through life,boy.","This movie is just not funny. It was as if it was made by Republicans. Republicans have no sense of art or joy of life. (They try to get by on Regis and heavy doses of prime time tv.) Harold Ramis said ""You should always work from the top of your intelligence."" BUT obviously some folks cant be helped. By the way to the smug chap you made the dumb remark about ""closing the Bible."" The Bible has funnier material in it than this movie."
1,Two words: DUMB and GROSS!,"I am scared to think that people actually enjoyed this movie. If people actually enjoyed this movie, it really tells me that my neighbors have no sense of dignity or taste. This is one of the MOST dumbest movies I have ever had the misfortune of renting. Cameron Diaz is over-rated as the silly, smiling blonde who falls for the nerd who can't even zip his pants. Do you people allow your children to see this movie with such graphic and crude scenes? Don't buy this video. If you want to see a funny movie, without the unnecessary crude scenes, watch a Laurel & Hardy movie or Chaplin himself -- those actors really knew how to make people laugh, the classic way."
1,See this movie (if your IQ is in negative numbers),"A movie for morons. This movie represents the depths to which our culture has sunk. If you have progressed beyond third-grade sniggling at ""pee pee"" and ""poo poo"" jokes, have an IQ which exceeds single digits, or can walk and chew gum at the same time, avoid this movie like the plague. I literally did not laugh a single time. I will be glad when all the social taboos have been broken on film so that the mere breaking of a taboo cannot serve as a substitute for wit and humor. You want funny? Any episode of the Simpsons is funnier than this piece of garbage. The ten minutes of Raising Arizona before the credits is a comic masterpiece but probably too clever and too subtle for TSAM's audience."
1,YUCK!!! I'd give it zero stars if I could!!,"I went to see this movie after seeing several hilarious previews. Trust me, those were the ONLY clean parts of this movie! It was extremely crude and vulgar. Grossest movie I've ever seen!"
3,"Great if you don't have it, but not worth anpther copy",Its a hilarious movie but the extras do not warrant another video purchase if you have the original.
4,Funny movie,"I loved this movie. Absolutely hilarious. However i haven't bought the DVD yet -- i've been hesitant because for some odd reason Fox decided not to release this in anamorphic widescreen (that's why i'm striking a star). This is a shame, after the great job they did with the alien legacy set. Hopefully they'll get a clue someday."
5,Very Funny,I don't know why all of you guys hate this movie! Sure it could have been a little better but I thought it was great!
3,"Funny Moments, Vulgar Atmosphere","The movie had several funny moments based on some classical techniques of comedy: misunderstanding and exaggeration. Maybe it is just like some reviewers have pointed out: this movie simply indicates the trend that our culture took--the trend of toiler humour. This is unfortunate, I think. The movie could have been great--the acting is good and some jokes work--but the sheer vulgarity ruined it for me."
2,Disappointing and way over-hyped,"Not my favorite Cameron Diaz comedy. If you want to see her in a good dark comedy, check out the quirky comedy/mystery/suspense movie Head Above Water.I did like how the characters in TSAM were such extreme over-the-top slimeballs, losers, etc. Matt Dillon did a good job in his role. The problem was, I expected the funniest movie in years and I didn't find it quite that good. Kingpin and Dumb and Dumber were funnier movies.This is a romantic comedy that's not too concerned with the romance. So, there's not much heart in it and the cheap yukks seem like cheap shots. All-in-all, a forgettable movie I won't want to see again."
1,Crude Doesn't Equal Funny,"If you make a list of a few of the films involving Ben Stiller:There's Something About MaryMeet the ParentsZoolanderTropic ThunderThe disastrous remake of The Heartbreak KidYou'll have a collection of some of the most inept films classified as comedies of the past couple of decades.Ben Stiller obviously learned nothing from his brilliant parents, but he did make a lot of money.To quote the great writer, H.L. Mencken: ""Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people."""
1,"If you didn't like Something About Mary, read this!!","Actually, this movie deserves 5 stars, I just wanted to grab your attention. It's 10 out of 10 on the comedy scale. Anyone and everyone who has a sense of humor will laugh uncontrollably from beginning to end. I do concede the fact that supposedly ""cultured"" viewers will combat their laughter by blowing off the humor as disgusting, childish and stupid, thereby destroying the whole point of watching a comedy. For individuals who decided not to enjoy this movie and denied their joie de vivre, it is unfortunate that you passed on the opportunity to laugh harder than you've ever laughed. As long as you don't take yourself too seriously, you'll love this movie. Outstanding and side-splittingly hilarious. Bravo!!"
2,Humor that will connect with boys aged 12-15,"Although I would not my boys to see this movie, this movies humor will titlate their senses. Very poorly directed, drags in places. Basically, a simple plotline with a series of gutter scenes and heavy use of the F-word to make the film seem real world. Cameron Diaz and cast have some chemistry. Ending is really stupid with Oscar caiber performance from Bret Favre... Not!"
1,Wish I Could Rate It A Zero,"This is one of the very worst comedies I have ever seen. Even though I like teen comedies this boring waste of time does not even reach an eight year old level. Based completely on toilet humor, it is boring and disgusting. AVOID."
1,"Tasteless, unendurable turkey","I can't say which movie in the world is the worst ever made, but when they give out the award this one will top the list. Electrocuting and blowing up the cat, rupturing Stiller's male organ on his zipper, the ex porn star who plays a gay in a rest stop targeted by a massive raid..these are a few running gags that should send you running 10 miles from any Fox cable channel that's showing it for the fiftieth time."
3,Great performances for cardboard characters,"Every actor and comic in this film does a fine job, though I think Matt Dillon makes for the best comic revelation. The real problem is that the directors string the story along in such away that the icky parts just annoy the viewer and flatten the attempts to develop the characters. The actors just become little plastic toys for the directors to move around in funny positions.In a way, the movie suffers from its own notoriety. The so-called outrageousness, so well publicized, distracts the story. Enjoy the film for the other, less well-known scenes, and it makes for a worthy rental."
5,just the best,I personally loved the film i laughed i almost peed my pants at some moments! Like the incedint with the chocking the chicken clean the pipes flog the dolphin. It was awesome if i could i would have givin it 10 stars.
3,Good laugh,"It has great gags, but the reason why I am not overwhelmed is: The brothers had a good idea (the private eye who falls in love with the girl he sould observe) but as the movie progresses they lose the set-up almost completely. Besides, I have to admit: I still think ""KINGPIN"" is the best Farelly movie."
3,Over hyped but very enjoyable.,"This film was very enjoyable, funny and at times painful to watch for example the bathroom scene with the zipper.I really enjoyed it would see it again and definately buy it when the price goes down. I liked the way it started when they were teenagers. The only bit I didn't like was Mary's brother being used for cheap laughs, apart from that it is the ingredient to a good film!"
3,Not worth all the hype,"Considering the immense hype that surrounded the release of this film with coments such as ""the funniest film of the year"" my expectations were high. This was a maximum three star movie and I would not recommend it. The pace is slow the gags are a partial atempt at slapstic but at the same time trying to maintain the Hollywood sense of cool. Diaz plays the limiting role of the women stalked by obsessive lovers. The writing gives for a wooden performance that aside from her looks does not do credit to her acting abilities. It bumbles along through some entertaining moments but looses it's way about 2/3 into the action with a very dissapointing ending culminating in an array of unimaginative scripting and wooden acting. One best left to true Diaz fans only in my opinion."
2,Funny.,The performances were fine but the script was weak as the plot.The good things are the funny scenes that you watch in the trailers and no more the rest is a superficial and stupid story.But the funny are very great I really laugh.
2,There's something about Mary--Something foul about Mary!,"This movie starts out with a lot of promise, with lots of laughs, but by the second half-hour, one is just clamoring for it to be over. It's an extremely uneven movie (although it must be noted that none of this is Cameron Diaz' fault, who does the best she can despite a poor script). The movie is a bore, and a waste of time. What a silly movie- just skip it!"
2,WAY overhyped......WAY,"This is not only NOT one of the funniest movies of the nineties, it's also not really all that funny, period. I love the Farrelly brothers, especially ""Dumb and Dumber"", but this movie misses the mark. The reason most people claim to love this movie so much is because of all the gross scenes. They thought that if they said they didn't like the movie, people would think they were prudish."
1,"no, it wasn't that funny and yes, it was that offensive","goes for the lowest commond denominator in humor. i saw it in the theater and thought uh oh, there goes western civilization down another notch... obnoxious. cameron diaz sparkles as always but was wholly unconvincing as an orthopedic surgeon or whatever she was supposed to be... i realize it's not a serious movie but it wasn't as fun as i'd been led to expect. disappointment."
1,Anyone Who Liked This Movie MUST READ THIS!,"Poo! Fart! Pee Pee! HA HA HA HA HA!If you liked ""There's Something About Mary"", the first line of this review must of given you a heart attack! Hee Hee, I said poo! After all, anyone who likes this movie is very childish and would laugh quite hard at a line like that.The simple fact is that there are no jokes in this movie. Just a whole bunch of people hitting eachother and using bodily functions as humour. It is all toilet humour! Any movie where the main joke is someone with semen on their ear is for little kids and immature adults.I know this movie was not meant to be inteligent but it doesn't justify laughing at toilet humour. The fact is; this movie isn't fit for my garbage. If you don't agree with me you probably are someone who belongs in the first grade. Hey, if you beg to differ, email me and express your childish opinions! I expect some pretty intelectual opinions!"
1,The BASIC INSTINCT of low brow comedies...,"While some tasteless comedies can be funny, repeatedly, this isn't one of them. Overblown and dumb in an uninteresting way, TSAM is on par with all those SNL-skit-turned movies. A few chuckles that are stretched way, way past the point of being funny, and upon multiple viewings, you're left asking yourself, why did I bother to see that more than once???"
3,Disappointed,"One problem is that the best parts were in the previews (as usual). So if you've never seen any previews for it, you might enjoy it more than I did. Another problem is that, as with Blazing Saddles and Animal House, it's a reputedly hilarious and raunchy movie that had too many psuedo-sweet or simply dull moments in it that slowed the essential comic pacing. I really think Kingpin is the Farrelly brothers' most successfully funny comedy."
1,Do I have to give it a star?,"Are there words to even describe how much I hate this movie? I know it had a lot of hype. I know it had a great cast. Unfortunately, they must have grabbed high school freshmen off the street to write the script---and that's probably an insult to freshmen! It was like someone had taken the worst of human nature, thrown in a liberal dose of very immature bathroom humor, and then tried to shore it up with sight gags and cliches. Please! It was a waste of good talent. What's more, I felt slimed afterward. Whatever previews I saw on TV were the funniest and cleanest part of the movie, and the rest was just a big, big disappointment."
1,Rock bottom as it gets!,"A friend had recommended this film as a ""must see"". I have to admit that after finally watching it, I now consider any movie advice from this friend as totally worthless. Underneath all the sludge there may have been a tiny glimpse of a somewhat interesting storyline, but who wants to bother looking for it when there are so many mundane, overdone, tiresome ""heard that one years ago in high school"" failed attempts at humor to cover it up.Sorry, but this this one just plain stunk up the place!"
1,CORNY!,"After reading all the glowing reviews for this movie, I thought that there MUST be something to it.....I was wrong.What a mess....very corny bits, one in particular looked like a dated Monty Python skit (where Ben Stiller gets caught in his fly, and all of a sudden the whole neighborhood is in the bathroom trying to find out what's going on, to his embarrassment. har har).Romy & Michelles High School Reunion, bad as IT was, still offered more laughs than this."
4,great movie,I love the movie and was happy that I could watch it instantly on amazon for a cheap price! Quality was good!
2,What are they thinking??,"I hate it when they don't create a Blu Ray with a proper master copy! Why the hell would they bother using a lower quality copy to create this??!?! It's just plain lazy. Don't bother buying, as it is obviously about the same picture quality as the DVD you already own!WAKE UP MOVIE STUDIOS!! IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HIGH DEF, FROM THE ORIGINAL MASTER, WHY WOULD WE BOTHER BUYING IT IF THE PICTURE IS THE SAME AS DVD!!!"
1,Paul the Dad,"I couldn't cover my son's eyes fast enough, and my teenage daughter's eyes were simply beyond my reach. Why, oh why did they ruin a hysterically funny film with that repulsive ""so you don't lose control"" gag? I'd buy the move ten times over if only that whole disgustingly graphic sequence had been left where it belonged - on the editors floor."
1,Don't waste your time. This one is bad...,"Cameron Diaz is wonderful. She manages to be charming, funny and dignified all at the same time. But she is the only good thing about this movie. The rest of it is bland, boring and juvenile. Frighteningly so in fact. If I was 14 and still thought body function jokes were funny, I might have liked this movie. As is, it is one of the stupidest, least clever, biggest wastes of time to come out of hollywood in a while. Don't go see it unless your sense of humor got stuck in your pre-teen years. This movie is a big, big waste of time. And an insult to the fine actress who fronts it."
1,rude crude and a one hell of a bad career move babe.,"Certainly not my idea of funny, it was mean, crude and had only moments when it was genuinely funny. It was a reasonale success so I guess that proves that it is some peoples idea of a good time. eg. Who would laugh at a dog having the wires of a power cord pressed into its stomache or a man being shot for singing or a down sindrome man be smacked down by an egotistical mean spirited #@!%& for playing a game, try telling me thats all in good humour."
1,Obnoxious and embarassing,"This has got to be the most over-rated comedy since The Birdcage. Actually, it's much worse than The Birdcage, due to its total lack of comic timing and its embarassingly awkward and tasteless ""humor""--e.g. guy mistakenly tossing some semen in his date's hair and her rubbing it in, thinking its hair gel--STUPID! I couldn't even finish the movie, it was so terrible."
1,There's Nothing about Mary...,"Nothing funny or sexy that is. This movie had one funny scene and that was when the cop bounced Stillers head off that table. That's it, nothing before or after. It was way over hyped and so is Diaz. She is not the Goddess everyone seems to think she is,there are alot more prettier actresses out there than her,Julia Roberts for one. And Roberts can act too. If you want a movie watch this,if you want a Funny movie,see Deuce Bigalow,it's worth the hype."
3,OK,The cameo appearance by Brett Farve is the best part of the film. The rest is so low brow...7th grade humor..that it is a bore. Young teens and gawkers will like this. Maybe a sports director I used to work with would like this too. HA.To adults this is mindless garbage.
4,"Hilariously Clever, Inspirating Film","Have you been looking for a film that makes you laugh out loud? Well, you've found it. There's Something About Mary is that rare film that is grotesque, funny, and clever while at the same time filled with heart-felt emotion. Also, the addition of Jonathan Richman as a ""greek chorus"" is a finely added touch that shows the Farrelly Brothers at the top of their game.The director's commentary is a great addition to this dvd. Most commentaries don't float my boat, but the real human warmth and humor of the Brothers shines through here."
4,There's something about this movie... Something good.,"When I saw the previews to this movie, I really hesitated in seeing it.Then everyone I knew went to see it... some repeatedly... most bought the video, as well.Then I saw it and bought it in DVD format, myself.I was amazed. It wasn't nearly as stupid as I thought it would be... it was truly a hilarious romp... funny love story.It's a date movie, and something you can enjoy with your older kids. If you really want to laugh hard...Get this one!"
4,"Not sure where it is going, but it is funny.","This movie is not for someone looking for an entertaining story about relationships. This movie is for those who want a laugh at the crazy things we do for love.I saw one of the award shows in which Ben Stiller shows the making of the fight scene with the dog. Wrongly, I assumed that I probably saw all the funny parts of the movie. Even knowing what was coming, I could not stop laughing as Ben Stiller fought off the drug-crazed dog. It was slapstick and professional wrestling all in one.The coverage of urban myths are funny. The whole chain of events of Ben Stiller's character going to Miami are hilarious.Given this is a farce, I expected some things to be unbelievable. That happens in comedy. The ending though starts to get a little out of whack as all the suitors for Mary wind up in her apartment. It has a feel of being thrown together.I would recommend this movie to those wanting a good laugh. Ben Stiller is an original."
3,"ok, so I liked it.","I didn't want to like this movie. It won me over. The gags are funny, the writting is good. I liked the twists and generally sweet nature of the film."
5,Beautiful Book,This book is absolutely beautiful. This would be a great addition to the family library and a wonderful book to start Christmas traditions with.
3,Animotion not working,"I have the kindle app on my iPad and bought this version specifically for the animotion. While the illustrations are quite nice, the animotion is not working at all. A word of warning for those with the same setup that I have..."
4,nice book but no animation in the kindle version,Nice looking book with great illustrations just shame there wasn't an animated kindle version. Our 5 year old loves it.
3,Needs some corrections,"The idea was to have our 6 year old read the story to us as she is an advanced reader for her age. Apparently nobody proof read the book-there at numerous 'spacing errors' in the book within a word that can make a child have to pause on a word, then all of a sudden there's a page near the end that breaks the pattern and has only an illustration and no text at all.Just errors that should have been caught. The story is very accurate. NO REASON THAT ERRORS SHOULDNT BE CORRECTED."
2,Poor adaptation to e-book,We thought it would be nice to read 'twas the night befor Christmas to the kids so we downloaded it on Christmas eve. Boy were we disappointed . The original words with nice illustrations for kids but a horrible adaptation to the kindle. It only shows one page at a time and the pictures and story are written across 2 pages so it's pretty much in readable. Also it doesnt even show up full screen.
5,This book is a classic,Twas the night before Christmas was a story that my mother would always read this to me on Christmas eve and I always enjoyed that one moment when she just whisper the last line merry Christmas to all and to all a good night. To this day o still love to read this book on Christmas eve
1,Blah book,"This was not a ""special"" Night Before Christmas book....and I have seenmany that are. The pictures were not ""crisp"" like children like them...andthere were no little surprises...which children love. I would not buy thisbook again...or recommend it."
5,BEAUTIFUL BOOK.,This was a beautiful book. My grandchildren and I loved the illustrations by Jon Goodell and the Animotion was an added delight. Definitely a keepsake.
1,Aweful!,thankfully I bought this at the holiday special price as it is not worth the $6. Words and illustrations run over and illustrations are so small there's no way to know if they're any good.
4,4 stars for the price and pictures...,"This was a great value buy. There are illustrations on most pages. They are a little smaller than I would have desired, but my kids were captivatied by the details in the illustrations. What kept it from getting five stars is that often the text did not match the illustration shown- I was bothered by it but my kids (1, 3, and 8 years old) didn't seem to mind."
5,treasure,"Bought to read to my two year old grand daughter,the quality of this book makes it a family treasue the aniMotion of the book helps keep the two year olds attention,I love it."
5,CHRISTMAS BOOK,This beautiful story with the collection of Coca Cola antique Santa pictures is a wonderful addition to our Holiday book collection.
5,GREAT BOOK FOR FAMILY CLOSENESS!,"I saw this book in a grocery store but got it for a much better price, even with the shipping, from this site.I thought it would be nice to start a yearly tradition of reading this classic story on Christmas Eve.We could have probably downloaded it for free, or borrowed a copy from the local library -- a rather good idea considering that every dollar counts these days -- but the ""Animotion"" was so appealing we thought it would be worth an actual purchase.And we were right! There is a moving image on nearly every page, and each of them are fantastic. Our son is five years old and absolutely loved it. I recommend this version as worthy modern version of a timeless classic (the wording of the poem itself is unchanged as far as I know, the ""update"" is simply the technology that gives the images their life). The cover is lovely and the artwork, even the pages without the holo stuff, is quite beautiful. Very well done.A wonderful book to read with your loved ones . . ."
3,Pictures only on every other page,"While the story is, of course, a classic, and the pictures are of high quality, there are only color pictures on every other page. A bit disappointing compared to the book we grew up with."
1,rip off,"I bought this book before Christmas 2011, believing I was buying the best version available. After receiving the book, it is good quality, but in no way ""antique reproduction"". It has the look and feel of any other kids book you would buy. I had great expectation about better paper stock and binding to make it feel more like a classic book (and reflect the price paid).I paid $120 for it, and now see that the price has gone up about 50%??? - and I feel like I way over paid.Don't be duped!Don't buy this item!I just found a website called [...] that actually shows antique versions of this book, and look nothing like this version."
1,I am so disappointed!,"As I always read the reviews before I buy something, I was so surprised when I received this book the other day and it was not at all what I expected. Of course the story is great, but the quality of the book is atrocious. The cover pictures are stickers! The back cover sticker that tells about the story is already peeling off. I guess being an heirloom edition and the high reviews led me to expect more. I have fairly realistic expectations when it comes to books, and even a dust cover over a plain cover would have been fine, but this is just cheesy and I will be returning it. If you are just looking for a copy of the book, it's fine, but if you truly want something to enjoy year after year, this is not it."
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered this book for my husband to read to our daughter on Christmas Eve - a tradition passed down through his family. When we received it, we read through it, and although the pictures are beautiful (classic Jan Brett illustrations) the illustrator decided to add her own ""twist"" on the classic poem by depicting trouble-making elves wreaking havoc in Santa's sleigh. The main pictures don't match the story, and the illustrations that do go with the words are shown in the small side panes. I suppose it might be a nice copy for an older kid, but for young children this seems like it would be confusing. We will be returning this book and continuing our search for a beautifully illustrated, classic version of the poem."
3,Great heirloom,"As other reviews have stated, the pictures are not the most eye catching. The book binding and pages are of high quality and our two year old loved hearing the story over and over again, even with the small drawings. Our book had a few pages that appeared to have been wet when bound so the ink from opposite page is on that page. Other than that issue, it is a nice book for the whole family to enjoy at the holidays."
4,Good version of an old classic,"Nice that this classic story has received ""the AniMotion touch"", but they probably could have done better. Not all the pages have AniMotion, which you really kind of expect in an animotion book. It makes the ""plain"" pages too boring, and my kids what to skip over them. Not a good thing for a book! Still, the animotion that is there is very good. I think train lovers will especially love the page with the toy train circling around the Christmas tree. Heck, I'm not a train lover, and this is still one of my favorite pages!"
5,Night Before Christmas,This book is the best for telling the story I have seen. It has strong pages so that any child can use it without damaging them. The holograms hold the childs interest. The artwork is of very high quality.An excellent addition to any child's library.Victor
5,GREAT PICTURES!!!,"My 2 1/2 yr old & almost 5 yr old LOVE this book!!! It is great that we can keep them both interested in this. Last year we forgot to buy this story & printed it off the web, kids had NO interest. This year they have made my husband read it over & over."
2,Nice Illustrations - Poor Animotion,"This book could have been a real keeper for a toddler and one to bring back happy memories for years to come - the pages are thick cardboard, the illustrations themselves book are bright and nicely done, BUT the ""animotion"" panels are so dim they're hard to see, and they certrainly wouldn't grab and hold a toddler's attention. I would have returned it, but the return shipping fee didn't make it worth it, so it goes in the donation pile for the next library sale. Too bad."
5,<3,This was perfect because I needed it to read to my class and it was handy just having it at my finger tips
5,Best pre-Christmas gift for children.,"The best classic children's story. The Little Golden Books are as well made as they were when my children were tiny so I loved giving this to my granddaughters,."
3,Pictures?,"There were no pictures in this book, not even on a Kindle Fire. The book introduction and description talk about Jessie Smith's art work."
2,Took a month to get it :(,I was pleased with the book however I wanted to read it before Christmas and it took a whole month to get here...maybe next year?
3,My opinion,"Generally I was pleased with this book. However, the illustrations show a young boy observing Santa, whereas the poem's text clearly indicates that the story is written from the perspective of the father of the house."
3,Not very impressed,"While this book features fabulous artwork, I was disappointed that the pictures inside the book are not as bright and colorful as the cover (and as I expected)."
5,a treasure,"I bought this book as a gift, and now that I've seen it, I'm going to order more. The classic story is made even better by the beautiful fabric-feel cover, cozy illustrations, and the yellow ribbon bookmark with a stocking on the end. You won't be disappointed."
1,Kindle Edition,The Kindle download edition of this book is flawed. There is at least one entire stanza missing from the poem. Since it's a very short poem to begin with they should at least give a discount for the missing content.
1,Short lived,"I bought these for my Mom who is getting up in age. I thought it would be nice for all the grandkids. It did't work, it only recorded part of her voice and was returned."
5,Beautiful illustration!,I purchased this book for my granddaughter for Christmas. I was shopping for a book with old-fashioned warmth. The website does not do this book justice! It's an absolutely beautiful book.
5,The Night Before Christmas creating memories that will last a life time,"The quality of book is excellent, pictures beautiful. And the hours reading it over and over again to my 4 year old daughter, Priceless!"
5,great!,My son loooves this book. I read it to him and he points out things in the pictures. Very nice!
3,"Great illustrations, but the ""AniMotion"" detracts from the quality","This is a good quality book, with pleasant illustrations, but the ""AniMotion"" takes away from the quality. Each page has a section that is designed to look like it moves (flickering candle, Santa's jiggling belly), but it is so dark that it's hard to see the movement. It would be a better book without the AniMotion."

2,The AniMotion ruins it,"Well, it's the same classic story and I thought my 2 year old might like the added ""AniMotion"" stuff, so I chose this version. Unfortunately, the parts that utilized the AniMotion were so dark, it was really hard to see what it was. I'm not sure if you have to look at it in exactly the right angle (I tried) or if I just got a bad copy, but I was pretty disappointed."
4,The Night Before Christmas--illustrated by Tom Nusom,This is an excellent rendition of a classic story. The illustrations are beautiful and the opportunity for interactive participation by the reader makes the story more magical. On each page is an envelope with contents that range from cut out snow flakes to Santa's naughty and nice list. It is a beautifully bound book and one that will be part of my Christmas collection to be enjoyed each year.
4,'Twas the Night Before Christmas - Beautifully Presented,This is a lovely book by the original author and the famous illustrator Jessie Wilcox Smith. It's a nice book to have on the shelf during Christmas time. I received it in very reasonable time and in great condition. Thank you.
4,Twas the night....,"The story is of course a good one. I like the colorful version of the book much better, my daughter would have too."
5,Has the vintage appeal!,Bought this for our daughter to read to her on Christmas Eve and to make that a tradition. Love Little Golden
4,Wonderful illustrations,This book had wonderful illustrations to go with a classic story. In the end it had a brief history of the poem. Great book for children
2,Kindle edition was not the traditional one I am use to,The words were translated incorrectly or changed. Very strange and a few misspellings. I am glad I only spent .99 on it.
1,Misspelled Reindeer Name,"This book misspells one of the reindeer names, listing ""Donner"" as ""Donder"". I bought this hoping to read it with my son each year at Christmas. I'd rather have a book without a typo."
5,Christmas Classic,"A have to have book for Christmas, one that every child should have read to them, just like in the movie ""National Lampoon's Christmas vacation"", when the family finally settles in for the night and grandpap hands the reading over to the the children's dad, passing down the tradition."
2,Classic Poem need of edit,It seems that now that we know the risks associated with the depiction of smoking characters for the youngest of readers it might be a good idea to limit the exposure to Santa as having a pipe and smoking in the middle of the Moore's living room. Is it okay to change a classic and a much loved poem if it means helping children wellbeing ? I think it is important and not a difficult change to make.
4,Great book,My kids found this book very beautiful. The illustrations are amazing too. We definitely will read this book as often as we could!
3,"Good, better with pictures",I would have liked to have seen pictures for the children. Wonderful addition to any collection. You can‘t beat the price.
5,Awesome keepsake for children or Grandchildren,We recorded a Christmas Story book for our youngest grandchild for her first Christmas. It was such a hit we are buying them for all 6 of our grandkids as their birthdays come along this year. So far we have recorded 3 & we have 3 more to go!
5,Night before Christmas,This product arrived promptly and will add to a collection of books of same name for grandchildren. Give one each Christmas.
5,Great Value,Book was a great value for the money. It will help this professional Santa with home visits.
5,The Night Before Christmas (Tenth Anniversary Edition),This book arrived was excellent in neat as new. We love this story for perfect christmas season every yearly!
2,Twas the format before proofed,"With close to default Kindle settings, the images are not on the same page as the corresponding text. This cannot be seen from the sample, since it contains only the title pages and the first page of the introduction. Switching to landscape doesn't resolve either, nor text sizing."
5,Grandkids Christmas,"I bought the book for my granddaughters for christmas. they loved the books and I am sure will cherish them for years to come. who knows, they may even pass them down, generation to generation.Christmas in Louisiana"
4,Prehistoric Men,"Men first became men when evolution has carried them to a certain point. This was the point where the eye-hand-brain co-ordination was good enough so that tools could be made.when tools began to be made according to sets of lasting habits, we know that men had appeared. This happened less then a million years ago."
5,Great trail guide.,"A great book for all skill levels. These books have areas of my backyard that I didn't know existed. Everything is well thought-out and organized. They're compact enough to leave laying around in your vehicles pockets. I only wish my Jeeps glove compartment wasn't as shallow as it is. My father always said, ""If you walk even 100 feet away from the parking lot you'll lose all the tourists"". The same goes for driving. Take one of these trails and experience true silence, serenity, beauty, solitude, etc. Don't let the 1 star review dissuade you, there must be ulterior motives at work. Competing book maybe?The spiral binding version is available on his website!! It lays flat!! funtreks dot com"
1,Really bad book,This book does not tell you anything useful.I am an experienced J2EE developer and spend 2 dayson it and do not find anything helpful.
1,Money Lost!,"This book is based on websphere 3.5, you may think it is okay, but things have changed too much from version 3.5 to version 5.0 , it is useless under version 4 too!. In version 3.5 the administration was done using a windows GUI but in version 4.0 web administration was introduced so all menues are gone, the examples are useless!. OK, the desing patterns presented are good but maybe not worth the money."
2,Warning: does not cover Websphere 4.0!,"I bought this book for the following reasons:* Seemed to cover J2EE including J2EE, including EJB development for WebSphere* Included a chapter on WSAD (Websphere Studio Application Developer)* High customer reviews* Low price (for used book)My biggest mistake was not to realize that the book was based on Websphere version 3.5 and the chapter on WSAD is based on version 3.5 as well, so this book was barely useful for me.It does have a good overview of J2EE, EJBs and Websphere, so I think that's what explains the high ratings: it is a good book if you're looking for introductory material on how to develop J2EE applications on Websphere, as long as you're developing on version 3.5. If you're using version 4.0 I recommend staying away from this book."
4,A Pretty Good Horror Comedy,"The Eye 3 (sometimes marketed as The Eye 10) is drastically different in tone from the previous two films. It's a horror comedy about a group of bored teenagers who spend the summer trying to contact the other side. Though some of the ghost scenes are genuinely creepy, much of the slapstick comedy is purile. None of the characters from the previous films appear or are referenced in this one.Fans of the first two Eye films should not expect to see a similar thriller when they purchase this video. If you are the type of horror fan who can see the humor in a breakdancing ghoul, and if you can forgive a few fart jokes, then you might enjoy The Eye 3."
1,The worst of the trilogy,"Wow, I can't believe I watched it until the end... it was just awful!I had great expectations because the first movie is one of my top favorites,the second was decent, but this one...I can't believe it was soooo bad... I am very disappointed..."
3,Pang Bros (last Eye) hopefully,"I am a huge fan of the original ""The eye"" films, Including both the first and second one. The third installment known as ""Eye 3."" It is the least thrilling of the series. There are several moments in the film that are ""right-on."" Hey if you are a fan of the film series; check it out. If you aren't then stay away."
1,Terrible movie,Don't waste your time or money on this one. The original The Eye and the remake starring Jessica Alba were great so I ordered Eye 2 and this lemon. I don't give it any stars but the site wouldn't accept less than one star. I didn't finish watching it.
2,"This is a remarketed title in wave of the recent ""Eye"" craze.","This is a remarketed title due to the recent craze of the movie, the Eye, thanks to the relentless bad American remakes of good Asian horror. This movie was originally called The Eye 10. This movie came out quite a while ago and techniclaly it is the third installment of the ""Eye"" series. I am a huge fan of Asain horror, including The Eye and The Eye 2 (The originals of course). However, the Eye 10 has had such terrible reviews I could not bring myself to spend any money on it. If it ever shows up on cable as a free movie, I would try to watch it just to see how bad it really is. I think it is crazy that this movie was retitled for Americans (even though it is not an American movie and has not been remade, make no mistake that this was renamed for the benefits of the Americans through Lionsgate to cash in on the recent aforementioned popularity). If you want a proper review of the Eye 3, google the Eye 10 and read (and weep) all about it!"
5,Swamp Rock N' Roll,This disk represents what I think is one of the best Rock N' Roll swamp pop compilations by a single artist. Rod Bernard has been doing it all his life and the songs on this disk are nothing but the best. It doesn't have a lot of the Swamp Pop twang. But if you listen to Swamp Pop you listen to Rod Bernard. This CD represents a lifetime of work and is a must for any Louisiana Swamp Pop fan to have.
5,wonderful warm reading,"I enjoyed this book immensely. It was very well written and quite objective, for being written by someone personally involved. I think people of all ages and generations, will be able to relate to this story, and hopefully like I did, come away with some personal insight of their own. And a box of tissues would not be a bad idea either. Well done Cynthia."
1,bad book,it lacks of what it preaches no visual book at all. very few examples much history. might be good for school but not for lean manufacturing professionals
4,Ignore the TMB hype for a bit and check it out,"PROS:- many levels, all with hidden secrets- unique style for a car combat game- tons of different weapons- cars have 3 specials instead of the usual one- nice pretty graphics, almost the SSX of car combat- not as morbid as TMB- play it around Christmas for a neat surpriseCONS:- loose control- only 1 hidden character- was in development for quite awhile, so should've been more polished- ""arena"" style of levels makes you feel like you're in the Truman Show rather than a real fight to the death- couldnt've been released at a worse timeOverall: not quite as good as TMB, but certainly more original"
1,How Do U Edit Luda?,"How do u edit Luda? Well, that can be done by either making an album that has two or three words in each song, or, what they did: Cut Out All But 5 Of The Eighteen Tracks and Sell The Album For Full Price. ... you can't possibly expect to like the edited version, can you? It has 5 tracks, which, below, i have given track-by-track reasons not to buy ""Word Of Mouf"" edited (clean):1. Rollout (My Business) - Cuts out a lot of the words, ...?2. Saturday (Oooh Oooh!) - WAY better explicit, you can listen to this one on the radio too.3. Go To Sleep - This is awful, you can't hear [anything] they block so much out.4. Freaky Thangs - Once again, awful!5. Area Codes - No point in listening to it, you can't even hear a word Luda's saying anyway.So, if you really wanna hear and get a full Ludacris experience, then you'll buy the dirty version of ""Word Of Mouf""."
1,word of mouf,here is some news that coming word of mouth this album is a load of cow manewer ludacris puts a capital l in the word lame all tracks have weak lyrics and wackk beats
2,"Ok, but aint the best","Ludacris's New Cd "" Word of Mouf is aiite, but it's sumthin i would not buy in the store. Coming to America is funny and demontsrates Ludacris's ability to throw comical lyrics( like the line wit Zamunda!). Also, Greatest Hits had me rollin as unhip folks try to reiterate his songs. Growing Pains is a bangin track, but only real hip hop heads would know the beat was jacked from Dilated Peoples ""Worst Come To Worst"". He just made the beat real slow. Roll Out is hot, but then the rest of the album suffers from poor beats and horrific guest appearances. JD ruins Coming to Atlanta, while the one wit those Memphis Three 6 Mafia just is not good. He needs to get better beats to complement his flows and discuss other topics besides the standard cars, ice, etc. 1"
1,Same old Ludacris,"Ludacris came back again, with pretty much the same material. His voice, is nothing special, and his lyric writing is sub-par. This CD is great, if you want to hear about hoes for 70 more minutes. Ludacris' only talent is his ability to flow fast as hell, which he didn't use as much as he should've. There are plenty of other better CD's, like Busta Rhymes-Genesis, Fabolous-Ghetto Fabolous, Nate Dogg- Music and Me, and Big Boi and Dre Present, Outkast. Ludacris lost a lot of white fans with his skit ripping on white people. Don't buy this CD, there are much better ones available."
2,Ludacris has potential,"I was pleasently surprised with how well Ludacris was ableto rock the mic, based on the poor lyrical performances he has displayed on his singles. Unfortunately, the production onWord of Mouf is dull and repetative. Of course, if you enjoy the garbage they play everyday on MTV the production will probably not bother you much. Ludacris has the potential to be a great mc. He just needs to get with some underground, talented producers and quit working with people like JD. Until he does, spend your money on Nas ""Stillmatic"", Wu-Tang ""Iron Flag"" or Dungeon Family's ""Even In Darkness."""
1,World Of Mouf (Clean),"You might want to look before you buy this. It comes with only 5 tracks :-( I'd rather reccomend that you buy the unedited version, because you get to hear more of Ludacris. If you have a choice, It's better to get the dirty one."
3,All Right but stole a beat,The CD is good but I think that 1 song would be really good and then the next song would not be. I also found out that on the song Growing Pains the beat was done by the Dilated Peoples on their new CD Expansion Team. I think that the CD is good but QUIT STEALING GOOD BEATS FOR YOURSELF!
2,Commercial Hip Hop,"This is a great cd.... If you like hearing about Hoes and someone brag about himself for 74 minutes. I liked some of the songs ( i gave it 2 stars for roll out, growing pains, and saturday) But You can only take so much of hearing the same stuff over and over: Hoes, money, and ice. Go pick up the great depression by dmx or stillmatic by nas."
5,this album is ludacris.....his best effort to date.....,"ludacris is one of my favourite rappers of all time.... that brotha has mad flow, he is funny, and he keeps it real all at the same time.... he is no lil' john.... i hate it when people compare the two and ludacris kills lil' john by a mile... ludacris IS the king of the club scene.this is his greatest album of his career.... the hands down best track is 'rollout'... the song speaks for itself....ludacris inlightens everyone with his catchy lyrics and he does not talk about people to get his point across (unlike eminem) nor yell through the whole song (unlike lil' john)buy this album....NOW!!!!"
4,Nice one!!!,"This CD is pretty damn good - the skits always crack me up. I consider a CD to be good if I can listen to all of the songs on it w/o having to skip over one. Here, I pretty much was able to listen to all of 'em. The only thing is, though Luda is pretty good, some of the people rappin w/ him on his tracks really have no talent. I dunno if they're his friends, posse, or just peeps who paid him to be on his CD. Some of 'em have really annoying voices and suck ass, whereas Luda's got this comforting sorta southern twang. My personal faves here are: Rollout, Cry Babies, She Said, Growing Pains, Saturday, and Move B****."
4,Good Album!,"First of all, i would like to make this clear that this is the first time I ever heard Ludacris! It is really impressive CD! Mix with gangsta rap and today's hip hop (Lil Jon,Eminem....etc) this album is very well done! The Intro sets up for and amazing album and one of the best ever!After that there are some other hot songs like: Cry babies, Move B*tch, and Area Codes! Others are great too!Definitely a must buy album!"
4,Great CD!!!,"Spread this, using the word of mouth, to pick it up! Luda combines toe-tappin beats with hilariously funny lyrics to make this cd so great. His comparisons, similes and metaphors make me laugh such as,'i pack more nuts as delta airlines,' your mommas so old she use to gangbang with the hewbrews,' and,'im great like 5 lakes.' The only crappy song is she said. Go pick this cd, but i dont reccomend to play it around your grandma."
5,Give Credit When Credits Deserved,"I hate southern rap; Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz, David Banner, I think their lyrics are garbage, and unitelligent. They also have crappy beats. Ludacris is different. When you hear his lyrics, they flow with the beats, especially in ""Word of Mouf"". This is the one! Definitley one of my favorite rap albums. Some say that Luda doesn't even come close to par with the older generation of rappers, but I think he's equally as good of telling stroies like Biggie Smalls, and comes up with great beats. He dishes out great tracks like there's no tomorrow. If you like anytype of rap, you should go buy this album. No questions asked. You definitly wont regret it, believe me."
4,Fun Album,Ludacris knows how to make a album that is made for the club and the streets and to me that is a great artist. I like almost every song but some are a little too much and I won't say which ones because I will let you to figure out when you buy it. I have all the Ludacris except Incognegro which is a pointless album because it is exactly like his debut except for a few songs. Anyways buy this album it is fun to listen and gets you hyped up for sports. HOLLA!
4,Good Production Album!!!,I am into lyrics just as I am into beats and production....but with Luda you don't get serious lyrics and you just have to deal with the beats....and they are really good!!!I didn't have to skip through one song on this whole CD.....and I think most people would agree with me that if Luda would have dropped any of these songs with a video it would make it to the number one spot on any countdown.I recommend this CD to anyone who was a fan of the first CD...also anyone who likes Mystikal....because they sort of have the same style!!! Peace out folks!!!
3,It's Good,"It's not better than ""Back for the First Time"" but this album is decent. Why ya'll hatin on ""Freaky Thangs?"" I like that song. Well my favorite songs off of the track are:""Roll Out""""Growing Pains""""Move""""Saturday""""Get the F*ck Back""""Freaky Thangs""""Cold Outside""Otherwise, this album was aight. Hopefully, Ludacris' third solo album will be better than this one."
5,This remains #1,"I had this CD for a long time til' it got stolen. I was mad but didn't hesitate to buy a new one. I tell myself to only listen to certain tracks, but before I have a chance to change the song, I start listening to the next one. This CD and artist are #1. Ludacris is the best!"
3,Ups and Downs all over the place,"Don't get me wrong folks, Luda be the shiznit. But the second album just doesn't get it done like his first. ""roll out"" gets old, almost laughable after a few listens. And honestly..why have all these other people on your record? Luda kept his featuring to a minimum on his first album but this one...UGH! too many people, luda should be showing off, not showing off others...this cd feels like the luda presents cd...NO ENOUGH CRIS! Some songs are tight, but some leave ya wondering why, a completley average effort..this man has only tapped his potential."
3,Oooh Ooooh!,"Here are the words of MY mouf:Not a bad album. Some of the songs take a while to get used to, but I guess if you dedicate your time to it, you can find some pretty hip beats on this album. Personally, I thought ""Roll Out"", ""Saturday (Oooh Ooooh!)"", and ""Get the F--k Back"" were probably the best of this album. But you have to give Cris some credit, cause he's got a lot of competition to keep up with, so this is why I rated this 3 stars."
2,A tired document of rap mediocrity,"I was completely let down by this record. I think Ludacris is a talented rapper with some crazy style but this record's got uninteresting synth beats, tacky skits, way too many guest rappers(to the point where Ludacris at times seems like a guest on his own album) and does nothing that hasn't been done countless times before. I'm surprised all the reviews here are so positive! I guess kids who don't know any better like this stuff. On the plus side ""Saturdays"" and ""Freestyle"" are okay and there are some funny moments. ""Freestyle"" actually has some of that Jungle Brothers energy to it but they only keep it going here for two minutes... Hopefully on the next one they'll have more in store. Keep away from this if you have a discerning ear!"
4,Luda did it again,This cd is a typical Ludacris cd. With him showing his humor. Every song is tight. I reccommend this to Ludacris and rap fans. YoU WiLl EnJoY tHe Cd.
1,this guy's the worst.........,"Can anyone get this bozo to shut up? He's so goddamn annoying, and he seems to be getting worse with every new album.Stop supporting this moron, people and listen to some real music for a change."
1,[Stunk],Yet another no talent rapper.Only thing that might be worse is that death/black metal [stuff].Not even worth the 1 star I rated it.
1,I'm a ludacris fan,"""I love this CD and other hardcore artists like Britney Spears and the Dixie Chicks. They are really hip yo. I think this guy is really talented because he can make simple two-syllable words rhyme and I can't. I want to be like Ludacris some day. He's soooooooooo cool!!!""Look people, This is dumb. The originators of rap would be ashamed that their art has turned into this slop. Stop listening to pop music; if you're going to listen to hip-hop, then listen to hip-hop. Ludapiss should be killed."
1,THIS S**** SO BAD!,hey if u want a good CD get JIMMIE EAT WORLD best band ever this cd just sucked there is no song w/out cuse words!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,.......wow.,"Back in the 1980s, ""Gangsta Rap"" arose from the streets of Los Angeles. It was real and it told about various hardships, including police brutality, gang wars, etc. But now, it seems that all rap is just a gaggle of rich, gold-toothed imbeciles making up words like Dr. Seuss. What do people see in this dreck, anyway? Do the primitive beats soothe them or something? If you must listen to rap (which I wouldn't recommend), listen to some of the 80's stuff. Please don't give this guy any more money.I will say this though: his name describes his music perfectly. (look it up)"
1,Oh my god!,How can people listen to this stuff? I can't stand rap music and I especially can't stand the rappers who do it ALL for the money. I hate Ludacris but I hate him even more when I saw that he was going to be guest starring in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Just listen to Move and you'll hear how much of a talentless person[] this guy is! Whoever said that death/black metal is worse than this is stupid.
4,Ludacris--Word of Mouf,"If DMX and OutKast had a love-child, his name, hip-hop fans, would be Ludacris. Track One's repeated thumping bass is reminiscent of almost anyone of X's cuts; seconds later, when Luda rhymes about bein' ""shorter than five Danny Devitos"" you know he's got the lyrical power to back up the thug mentality. I like to call this music OutKast on crack. ""Word of Mouf's"" only downfall is in its poorly written hooks. Don't get me wrong, the lyrics or bangin,' and Luda's performance on Track One is enough to boost this disc to the top of any hip-hoppers a-list; ""Move B***h"" is tight, but the repetitive chorus does nothing to advance the track, much like many of X's cuts. Luda lacks the poetical strength and restraint of OutKast, but he makes up for it with ""Growing Pains,"" a sentimental cut that showcases the rapper's softer side. My advice: Buy this album, but don't expect an ""Aquemini."""
3,...,"I give it a 3...and THAT'S just being nice! I am a HUGE Ludacris fan, but this cd, it was worthless. It's the same as his last one, ""Back for the First Time"", basically. Same kind of beats, same production, same topics! Come on now, Luda, get some new stuff man! For real, I love Ludacris to death, but I was expecting more. I would say, don't bother buying the cd, get it ... or somewhere! I don't mind the occasional ""slip of the tongue"" words he uses, but Luda is rhyming about the same stuff, money, cars, & ...I'm getting sick of it already! I think he is a phenominal artist who can ride any beat, but his content is getting repetitive! This cd just made me want to take it back to the store and pick up another copy of ""Back for the fist time"", since it is basically its clone! My advice...don't get it, borrow it from a friend if you have to!"
1,can't get into His stuff,this album never got off the Ground with Me.it's pretty much the same stuff being Promoted in the Biz.nothing special about His flow or His Music.He is like Coolio with a Slow Drawl.catchy stuff but forgotten in a week.
1,Dirty Version = MUCH better,I am a huge fan of Luda...but this CD SUCKS. The unedited version is MUCH MUCH bettter
2,Ludacris Clean Version?,"All I got to say is if you want to hear Ludacris, dont get this CD. I mean you cant possibly get a Ludacris experince with all the words cut out. Plus this CD only has 5 songs, and it sells for full price. If you really want to listen to Luda, get the uncensored version with 18! tracks. If you prefer the cut out words, listen to the damn radio"
1,a drain on the intellect,"This album as well as the artist is absolutely and unequivocally the most vile and mentally enprisoning, brain wrinkle reducing noise laced with down syndrome corky written lyrics. The mental capacity of this man is equal to that of a termite neglected by a higher power of its instinct to eat wood and spends its pitiful and useless existence in a brick house gnawing on hardened clay in a state of perpetual dumbfounded perplexity. Anyone who buys this album will be boiled down to the iq of a gerbil."
1,"""Ludicrous"" is an appropriate description","Yet another sleazy, morally bereft, utterly talentless, self-centered, materialistic, depraved, foul-mouthed, and just plain stupid rapper that has absolutely nothing to say, but deluded into thinking he does. At least he chose an appropriate handle for himself. Pretty ludicrous, all right."
1,"Ludacris is the one who should move, and get out of the way.","Here it is. Another sell out rapper that makes no sense, creates crappy beats, and has his songs slamming in urban white boys Jeep Cherokees. Enough is enough. I know too many Ludacris songs because I know too many people who listen to this garbage so don't think I'm someone trying to mess up the review scoreboard, he is truly a piece of crap, a sellout, and un-original."
1,Ludicrous..........really,"Ludicrous is easily one of the biggest douchebags in the world right now. Who listens to garbage like this? Is this the face of rap today? Its just horrible, the lyrical content is deplorable, any drunk at a bar would have better songwriting skills than this bozo. This guy is a coarse, cheap scumbag and we could all do best by just ignoring him and all the other godawfuls that wanna be just like him."
1,BS Skills,"Ludacris should just hang out with Missy Elliott in the Middle East and have a bomb fall on them. They are like 90 percent of the rappers, no talent. He puts together elementary rhymes along with no flow and no point. He should retire and go back to McDonalds. That is all his skills are worth, minimum wage."
1,heal yea,"i b chillin wit da dawg 4 real luda iz da tytest rhyma in da hystory of da word 4 eva!! He got mad skillz cuz he keep rhymin bout hiz hoez which iz tyte cuz my whyte azz dawgs keep chillin at my plaze wit dis CD YO!! It real tyte how he spell mouf 4 real. if u don't git dis CD, u ain't a real dawg, yo!"
1,This is too funny,And not in a good way either.Ludacris would be a more than perfect way to describe this talentless and stupid ... rapper.Bunch of mindless drivel if you ask me.I strongly suggest avoiding this album.
1,Ouch!,"This album makes me wonder what has happenned to hip hop music. Ludacris has weak emcee skills matched with equally weak lyrics. The fact that Ludacris raps only about money indicates how shallow he is, and also the type of family, society he grew up in. One in which he was raised poorly, falunting his money and not showing gratification for his success. If i could rate this album zero I would. Hip hop as a culture and form of music is beign destroyed by artist's as such."
1,shipper sent me wrong cd then did not respond to emails,i waited three weeks for this cd then when i got it the cd inside the case was some bass test cd.
2,Eh.,"Out of all 3 of Ludacris' CDs, this one is this best, which shows you how bad the other two are. Good songs: Rollout, Move B****, Growing Pains. Worst song on the CD by far is COLD OUTSIDE. WTF is he thinking? Horrible song to end a CD with. This, and all the other songs not mentioned, can be SKIPPED. The best part of the CD, however, is the GREATEST HITS Skit. Funniest thing EVER! So i wouldn't spend my money on this CD, download the good songs of iTunes, Kazaa, whatever you use. Save your cash for a better investment."
4,Tight Album!,"Ludacris ""Word of Mouf"" is a pretty good album if you look at it on terms of the album's skits. ""Stop Lying (Skit)"" is one of the funniest skits on the album. Ludacris and Infamous 2.0 is trying to get some play from a girl, they were doing fine until... their mother gets on the phone!My favorite songs on the album are: ""Growing Pains"", ""Get The F**k Back"", ""Welcome to Atlanta"" (hidden bonus track), and ""Freaky Thangs"". It looks like Ludacris didn't give us a bad set after all! I can't wait until ""Chicken and Beer"" (Ludacris' third album) comes out!"
3,great shoe,"It was a great looking shoe. Its put together really well. Problem was its about a 1/2 size too big. And because amazon said it wasn't their fault I had to pay for the shipping back to them. How was I supposed to know. So now you know. If you get this shoe, get it about a 1/2 size smaller and you should be good to go! Good luck!"
1,A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!,"DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES!!! Do not be enticed by the cheap price as I was. I thought for $25.00 even if the shoes only lasted 6 months to a year it would be worth it. However, they only lasted 2 months. The heel came off just like other reviewers said. I took them to get repaired and the shoe repair would not even fix them. He said they were too poorly made. I am also disappointed in Amazons return policy of 30 days even for defective products. They were purely a waste of money!"
4,Great Bargain and Style,I bought these for like $25 on a day they were on sale. I love them and they live up to the Kenneth Cole style. I wear them a lot with my suits for my work and are extremely comfortable and stylish. I actually found them to look better in person than they do in the photos.
1,Bad Quality,"The shoes look good, but the materials are very poor quality, too much money for their real value."
2,"Unlisted Men's Best Oxford, Black 9.5 M","Nice looking shoes for the the money (sale price $25)and fair/good quality, but the size 9.5 M I bought was actually more like a size 11.5 to 12. Evidently the shoes and the box were mismarked 9.5 M. I already have a pair of skis and did not want to mess with sending them back to Amazon. So I gave them to a friend with a bigger feet who could fill the shoes I could not. Anyway, my friend says he likes the shoes and wears them frequently. So when ordering beware that the shoe size I received in the mail ran really big...like two sizes too big. My bad luck...a friend's good luck."
4,thin soles but nice price,"these are not ""quality"" shoes but they're great for bad weather. i bought a pair in black and brown for the winter. rubber soles and cheap so i dont care if they get ruined in the snow."
1,You get what you pay for,"For $24.95 I figured I couldn't really go wrong with these shoes. But I was wrong. These are definitely a $24.95 pair of shoes. If it didn't say Kenneth Cole Reaction on the box I'd swear they were from Walmart. Very cheap looking. I actually sent them back to Amazon and kept my $24.95.They should rename these shoes from ""Best Man Oxford"" to ""Cheap Man Oxford"" because that's what people will think when you walk around in these."
3,"Full-time, Wallstreet",Leather feels cheap. Interior of the shoes are not leather but fabric. Heavy on the feet and painful to walk on without inserting your own padded soles. They look decent for the price. You get what you pay for.
1,Not a good buy,"Buyers, beware. After I wore the shoes and walked, I almost broke my arm. This floor was not wet or slippery. It was the shoes!! Very uncomfortable as well. I wasted my money. I am going to order Kenneth Cole or Bostonian."
3,Back to the Anemone.,"This short story takes place after the adventures of the movie FINDING NEMO. Basically, it tells what happens to Nemo during a day in school. Other than that, there is no plot. The illustrations are not the quality of stills and shots from the film, but are recognizable. This is a decent book for young children who have seen the movie and also makes a decent gift for any fan of the film."
5,great book,This book was exactly what we expected. It is very informative and my husbands drum instructor is using it for lessons. Good Buy !!
4,Managed to learn quite a bit even though I have no drumset...,"I own several Dummies books. As usual the Dummies series has managed to turn out a book for... Dummies. Even though I have no drumset I still managed to learn the basics. However the author is quite ""talkative"" but I think that kept me from falling asleep on the book. Good buy!"
2,Please Read....,"I had purchased this product to learn how to drum better on my kit, and there is complaint about that at this moment, but when opening this product I was very happy granted the book was a little beat up, but I was fouine with that. The only problem I had was the CD was split in half! Now If he can send me a new CD I would be very happy and would change my feedback.Thank you"
4,Eastern Indian Tribes and Medicinal native plants,It was exactly what I needed. It explains the many uses of the native plants with documentation.
4,Con: Flash Pro: Great outdoor photos.,"This camera takes great outdoor pictures-couldn't be happier. However, the flash is pretty much useless after one picture, unless you wait 2 or three minutes. I have printed absolutely fantastic 8.5x11 inch photos of various outdoor scenes; cannot distinguish from a regular 35mm camera photo!! Some of the photos of active porpoises, whales, etc. at sea. Came out great!I haven't begun to tap all the camera's capabilities. I bought when camera first came out( two or so years ago?) at a considerably higher price ... . It still works great and I only wish it were a little more compact. The flash problem doesn't concern me. Sometimes, depending on lighting conditions, indoor photos can be taken with flash ""off"" and come out fine.Anyway, camera certainly worth price being asked, assuming in good working condition? ""Macro"" very good, too."
5,Great 36 view in one frame,"Beside printing perfect pictures, it is the only digicam that I know of that takes 36 continuous shots at high resolution in one frame. Great for analyzing golf swing or other sports!"
3,It broke,"Nice camera at first. If you take 3 pictures of same object 1 picture will be extremely sharp and the other 2 will be noticably fuzzy when you zoom in. I don't know if this is an autofocus problem or hand jitter problem. Taking videos with this camera is fun and more convienent then carrying around a second video camera. The video quality is poor, but it beats having nothing. Everything else worked well with the camera. I didn't have a problem with the battery. I was able to take 100+ pictures with my battery. After about 6 months with the camera we were on vacation in California. The battery went out and the lens wouldn't retract. After charging at home the zoom lens wouldn't move. No doubt it broke in the handling."
2,"bottom line, pics are not all that good","this camera has every feature i could ever want. the battery is charged in the camera which is how they all should be. everything needed comes with it. the macro mode is a joke, closeup would be more accurate. even with a 13x add on lense it was not good enough for even flowers and was a pain to keep changing. the m65 is much better for photo quality and has a great macro. the pictures bothered me though with the 70, most were just a little out of focus in auto, fuzzy, or they had a haze, washed out look. the color was not good. the shutter delay way too long with the slow focusing. i sent it back to toshiba and bought my nikon."
3,USB no-go if you have Win95!,"Good camera, bad news for those with Windows 95B (USB support). Even though the technical data says ""USB interface"" and ""minimum system requirements Win95/98/2000"", you have to have Win98 to use the USB interface. Which leaves us Win95B users stuck buying another expensive piece of equipment to download the pictures into our PC. I'm not even confident that it will work if I upgrade to Win98 because the instruction booklet says ""Pre-loaded Win98"". I don't know exactly what that means.I do like the camera, though I had to return the first one because of a slight discoloration on the left side of the screen during movie mode."
3,....,"The PDR-M60 is a more economical choice. 2 megapixels is all you need for 8X10 prints.The M70 is just the M60 with: a) 3.3 megapixels instead of 2.3 b) a movie movie (how useful is a 2 minute movie? it just takes up valuable space), c) an extra 32MB of memory (24 onboard and a 16MB card instead of 4mb card included),Other than that the optics, flash, and various shooting features are identical....the movie mode is cute but not something I'll use more than once or twice.All that being said, if you absolutely have to have 3+ megapixels, the PDRM70 is a good choice.Either way, using rechargable AA batteries is the way to go. Being able to buy a couple of Alkaline batteries in a pinch beats missing out on pictures. My Sony's propriatery rechargable batteries were...unreliable."
3,details,"The details are fascinating. . . I don't believe them all. I think some of the stories she tells are good old urban myths. In any case, she uses an awful lot of toilet paper."
3,They don't make them like they used to...,"As an avid fan of the older PC games like the original 2D Duke Nukem, Crystal Caves, Secret Agent, and others, I was very much into the Commander Keen series. Apogee and ID made 6 titles under the Commander Keen name, and Softdisk made Keen Dreams, a strange offshoot of the series.So, several years later when they released this for the Game Boy Color, I decided to pick it up. It was cheap, and how bad could it be?Well, bad is an understatement. Although the game features enemies and locations reminiscent of Keen 4-6, the game plays completely different. The pogo stick jumps different, the ray gun shoots different, and the lackluster stages and frustrating platforming will have you losing most of your lives in just a few short minutes.To me, this isn't Keen, and this isn't worth the money."
2,Poor sound quality,The album sounds like it was recorded in a tin can. That is unfortunate because the song selections are good. Quincy is great as usual but the recording quality is so bad it is almost unlistenable.
4,Simple but hard to tell if it is making a difference,"This is Simple to use but hard to tell if it is making a difference. I do not regret getting it, just am not sure what difference I should be seeing,"
3,How do you know if it works?,"I'm not sure this works. I've placed a bit of water in the cup and an hour later it is still there,....like it hasn't absorbed any water at all. Has anyone out there been able to measure the absorption of this thing?"
4,Flossbrush improved slightly,The post that the floss is wrapped around is now elongated compared to previous versions. It seems to grip the floss better. The floss quality is still only average.
2,NOT what I expected,"I don't think it says this anywhere -- this is just like a face-mask -- it does not cover the back of the lamp, and so looks awkward when viewing from the sides or back.The elastic strap on the back was barely strong enough to hold this onto our lamp and keep it from blowing off.Otherwise, the material of the cover itself seems strong and is attractive, but I had expected something that draped over the lamp, not hang on the front of it."
3,Cute but too small,I liked this product but it was too small for my light. It was not big enough around and it was not easy to put on
1,Music for Sight Singing,I never recieved my book and Amazon still has not refunded me for cancelled orders. I am extremely dissatisfied and will not use Amazon in the future.
4,Music for Sight Singers,A great book for learning to sight read music. It also helps to increase your skills if you already have some knowledge in this area.
1,Rip-Off,"This review is not a review of the book (which, I guess, serves it's purpose just fine), but a review of the price. $70 for a spiral-bound book!?!?!?! As if college isn't expensive enough already."
1,WRONG MODEL NUMBER,"Beware! This item is NOT the GCS1742! Read down into the specs; it is actually the GCS1734, which is also available from Amazon. (The 1742 enables switching of two computers each using keyboard, mouse, and TWO monitors simultaneously; hence the name ""Dual View."" If that is what you want, don't buy this one!"
5,Fantastic Resource for Everyone,"This DVD is an excellent resource for everyone-kids, parents, teachers, and yoga instructors. I love its simplicity. It was fun for children and instructive for parents. Brynne does a great job balancing the postures with the reasons why these postures are so effective for children (and adults). My cousin and her two children do the DVD every morning, and she says it helps her kids to focus and get through the day with little melt downs or behavioral issues. I love that the music, set design, and yogis were all local from Hawaii-it was a very special touch to a very special DVD. I can't wait for the next one!"
3,Fun and cute toy...,"Great novelty item- very cool looking and the electronic feature is pretty cool- doesn't just pipe out the music it plays according to your hand movement so it will play a tune at whatever speed you are ""strumming"" (hand brushes sensor at the bottom of strings)...Received this very quickly...Screw on back to install batteries is made of very soft metal and stripped while using a regular phillips screwdriver... Wound up busting off the plastic tab holding it in place to get the new batteries in (I'm sure the company would have helped me but I'm a fix it kind of a person)...Replaced screw and works just fine...It is plastic (hey Martha, this is some serious faux bois!) and good for older kids... Fun for a luau themed party..."
4,Why isn't this guy a superstar?,"Darrell Joyce has got to be one of the funniest guys I've ever heard do stand-up. He sees things from a very everyman's point of view. www.Amazon.com mistakenly lists this album as being titled ""Whatever"" when its true title should be ""Hwhatever"". But, I can see how no one would find it under that spelling. Darrell does not dwell on his race, but does bring it up in a way that all ethnic groups can understand and agree with. Not the typical ""potty-mouthed"" black comic, Darrell manages to make adult humor funny without being overly vulger. I recommend it heartily!"
5,"The best Wheel of Time book, in my opinion.",This is an awesome book! The best of the Wheel of Time by far
5,"The Fires of Heaven (The Wheel of Time, Book 5)","If you have started with book one - why stop!These books are ""acted"" as well as read."
4,The Fires of Heaven,"Like the 4 preceeding it, good reading. I'm sure I'll keep reading them all until I'm finished. It is like reading one gigantic book. Good stuff!"
4,There's No Turning Back Now...,"I'm slowly plodding along in my reread of the series, a little late, since A Memory of Light was released two days ago. Book five is one of my favorites, because even while the recycled phrases and clichés weigh down Jordan's prose, the developing characters speed the incredible epic forward. Fans of Perrin, Faile, and Loial may need to skim through this one, but other favorites flourish. Some of mine lived to see themselves become hateful, sniveling vermin *cough-Nynaeve-cough*, but at least *SPOILER* they find some redemption in the end. And by book five, it's too late to turn back. The Rubicon was some three thousand pages earlier, so I have to press on, for better or for worse, Tarmon Gai'don, screaming defiance, hocking loogies in the Sightblinder's eye, yadda yadda."
3,Where is Perrin?,"I was really excited about reading this book when it came out because I had finished ""The Shadow Rising"" in two days because I was so addicted to the Two Rivers/Perrin storyline. In this book I really wanted to read more about Perrin because by then I had gotten a bit tired of Rand. Then I read this book and to my disappointment there is NO Perrin.... The storyline is pretty good but their needs to be more action. I am being kind giving this book a 3 star rating."
2,WOT Fan,"I gave it two stars because, other than the big battle about 3/4 of the way through, it was too slow! Perrin wasn't even in the book at all, and he is my favorite charater. This book is definitly not up to par with its predecesors."
3,Suspicions,"I have just been rereading the series and have had a strange suspicion...I do not believe this series is being written by the same person. First of all, the every book is written with a slightly different style. Second, there are many inconsistencies in the series for example some of Min's viewings from the first book never show up later, maybe they are still yet to come? or were forgotten or not used by successive authors. Also starting with this book, book 5, many inconsistencies begin to show up, for example, at the end of book 4 the Avendesora tree in Rhuidean has only one limb broken, but in the beginning of book 5 it is burnt to a crisp...Finally, while there are many appearances of ""Robert Jordan"" at various events, the appearance of having just one author would not be hard to do, and ""Robert Jordan"" is actually the main character in a book entitled ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" by Hemingway!"
2,"Certainly not as good as the other books, but still good","Well, this book was almost boring! Only because it's a Wheel of time book I kept on reading. I must say: the scenes with Rand in it while fighting the Shaido's and the scenes with Nynaeve and Elayne were very borin. Only the parts with Min and co. and Liandrin were cool, but as you know, this is about 100 pages long. Too bad, but book 6 was one of the best, so don't stop reading after having read Book 5!"
3,I liked it!,"I liked it! but I have to say that Robert Jordan switches and adds new characters constantly, so it's hard to track. Also a bit too much descriptions for me... sometimes he could have described something in one paragraph but he does pages of it. Other than those two points, I love the series, it's taking me for ever to get through, but it's definitely good enough for me to continue and finish it. I am loving it."
5,"used book, just as described","I purchased this book for my husband and it came earlier than estimated. My husband is almost finished with the book and he is enjoying it very much. Great service, great price."
4,The best ending yet!,"This book was great! The way Jordan will send some kind of twist to the story and get you excited is magnificent. Jordan loves to hit you with the excitement when you least expect it, then let you calm down and hit you with one again. As with all of the books so far you do not know what to expect until it happens. The only thing I did not like about this book was the absence of Perrin anywhere in the book. Other than that Jordan gives the characters old and new more depth and life. So far I have been quite pleased with the series as it becomes more interesting with each book. Hopefully, book six will be just as good, if not better than this one."
2,Too much battle of the sexes,"I like the Jordan series, but the battle of the sexes is becoming fastidious. It's commendable the way Jordan has cast women into powerful roles in the series, but he has done so to a fault. It seems to me that women are not only equal to the men, but superior. The women can hardly say anything at all about the men without some dispariging remark. If the roles were reversed and the comments about the men were made about women, the series wouldn't survive. This book seems to be the culmination of predominant sexist theme in the book. The sexism is the antithesis of what we see in the real world, and it is just as irritating. The book itself is good if you can ignore this feature, or if it doesn't bother you. The idea of Elayne bonding Rand just seems absurd to me and it castrates what should be the most powerful character in the series. Of course I'll keep reading, I have too much time invested in the series to stop now."
3,Filler,"I've got to say that about half the time I was reading this book I was waiting for something to happen. Even the best series have their filler installments and this is definitly a perfect example. Half of what happened could have easily been left out. The only reason I finished it, and probably the only reason I'm going to read the next book is that the story is still good. When something actually happens it's exciting. Hopefully the books pick up from here."
4,Fire,Good read.Would recommend for anyone with a desire for epic fantasy.Excited to read the next one of the series!
5,Continues to grab my attention,I thought the books would have to get less interesting as the series progressed but I have to say I've enjoyed every single book in the series to date. Definitely recommend.
2,Man bashing galore,"If you like man bashing, arrogant women. This is the book for you. I thought that the women would get better as the series went on, but it's much worse. I don't understand what they are so angry about. It's bizarre.This entire book is basically dedicated to these snippy, condescending, man hating women. I don't know if I can continue the series. About 900 pages of this is too much. OK, OK men are stupid...I get it.I have to say my favorite part of the series so far was when Egwene got beat to a pulp.I wonder if Robert Jordan is really a man?"
1,Not Very Good!!!,"I read the previous books and they were great!!! But this is a bit farfetched. I don't want to read a soap opera. That's what it's like. Characters argue about nothing, stupid, unimportant things happen. all the characters bicker endlessly with each other. jordan wants to be another tolkien, so hes describing everything describable. it's a very bad book. it's too long. read the previous books. don't bother with this one. his writing isn't good either. there is too many mistakes. sentences are bad. i can't believe people actually like this. don't let your children read it, there's nasty stuff."
4,The Fires of Heaven Review,"I enjoy the series very much, even though a lot of it is long winded. I find the story complicated and sometimes confusing but always enjoyable. I basically use listening to it at the gym while doing cardio and it helps pass the time. The set I purchased is used. No flaws so far have been noticed on the recording although the package was in bad shape."
5,Terrific book and most immersive series ever,"This book series follows some standard fantasy themes but the level of detail and plot depth are unmatched in any series in any genre that I've ever hear of or read. If you want a book/series that manages to craft an entire world and its peoples to an extent that, at times, it could be a history book but that manages to do all of that while also using a plot that is second to none in complexity/entertainment then this book and the Wheel of Time Series is for you."
4,TFOH-- two thumbs up,"I really enjoyed this book-- book six hasn't gotten here yet and the wait is almost unbearable. I didn't give it five starts because Elayne began to really tick me off around page... two hundred? Some of it was predictable but overall I thought it was well done, and it's keeping me waiting for ""Lord of Chaos"". Well worth the read."
5,"Excellently written, but a bit of a black/white world...","Jordan's book is indeed excellently written, as is his whole series. He has a created an incredible world which, I think, many other stories can be based upon. The storyline is ingenious, the magik forms as well. However I agree with res@randomc.com( from Atlanta, 08/23/97, rating=5) when he says it's a TOTAL good vs. TOTAL evil issue. reality is nowhere near to like that. Other than that, the story is nearly utterly flawless.. I eagerly anticipate his next book..."
5,Fires of Heaven,Robert Jordan takes you on a journey into a world that will embrace you. This book provided hours of terrific reading and escape. I llok forward to reading the remaining books.
5,Fires of Heaven book 5 from Wheel of Time,This book arrived in great condition. Nothing was wrong with it. Very satisfied. I ordered this to finish my husband's collection.
5,Another Very Happy Customer!!,I love Amazon! It is easy and the reviews make it easy to know what company you want to use for your purchase. I am VERY happy with the books I purchased. I made my purchase at 8:00pm and they were shipped the next day. I expected it to take 14 days to recieve them but recieved them sooner than expected since I had them sent the cheepest slowest way possible. I think it was a total of 7 days and I had my books! That's GREAT service!! Thank You Very Much!!
5,Best fantasy series,Any fan of fantasy or just a good story should read The Wheel of Time. Fantastic series.
4,Better than Shadow Rising,"This is better than the last book The Shadow Rising, but isn't as good as the first three. Still a great book and a wonderful read. I was amazed on the character devlopment this one had. I can't believe Jordan is able to maintain such a daunting task as dragging this series out while keeping reader's interest."
4,For those who say the series is going down hill...,"Although this book is not the best in WOT it is necessary. Jordan has created a wonderfull series, but whithin the series he needs a few stepping stones, this is one of them. Be patient, get through the stepping-stone books so that you can enjoy the great books that come after it. This book is very important because it introduces the Aiel, they definatly have a big part to play in the series. BE patient and remember these books are a SERIES they are not ment to be judged alone. Think of the WOT series as a single book and all the books chapters in the WOT book. No one judges a book by a couple chapters."
4,"Good, but not great.","I felt this book did not pack as much punch as the first 4, but that's not to say I didn't like it. I liked it a lot, actually, and thought the ending was very good. Nynaeve vs Moghedien was awesome! And I (like everyone I'm sure) am dying to know who Asmodean sees at the end. Here's hpping that both Moiraine AND Lanfear are still alive and duking it out somwhere."
2,Actions would speak louder than all these words....,"This volume is where I gave up on the ""Wheel of Time"" series. The scenes became too repetitious, all the characters started sounding alike, and the overall story had long since lost its direction. Strange, but I recall being impatient during the first 100 pages of volume I, ""Eye of the World."" That was just a hint of the frustration to come. Jordan created what could have been a fascinating world with a well-imagined matriarchal society, and hinted at many intriguing things about its past... then drifted off into endless scenes with the female characters b***hing about the men. If the series ever ends, the publisher should hire somebody to boil the whole thing down to 1,500 pages or so."
2,The start of the downhill,"After the well paced, throughly enjoying start of this series, The Fires of Heaven shifted Robert Jordan's overrated series into a new, slower gear...a gear that it still has not shifted out of, as any reader of A Path of Daggers will tell you. It is here that he decided to fragment his epic story into several hundred subplots, peopled by several hundred minor, flat characters, and written with several hundred repeated phrases and descriptions.Rather than continue on with a focused, interesting tale, Jordan instead decided to create the never-ending Melrose Place of fantasy, with characters popping in and out at a head spinning pace. A terrible waste of paper.Read the first three books in this series as a trilogy, then, for the love of god, stop their before you get sucked in..."
3,"It was a struggle, but I made it to the end...","The WOT books are getting harder and harder for me to read -- and I'm listening to the unabridged audiobook versions!!! The series started off with a bang and has gone gently downhill ever since. I must admit, this book was better than the last few but this isn't the best fantasy series I've ever read. Just the longest. The book does have some merit, I was happy to see a little romance, there was a decent amount of action, and there wasn't too much of that ""irritating"" braid pulling!!! But as I've said before with Jordan's books, he kills you with details and you have to wade through the details to get to the story. On the other hand, if you like details, this is the series for you!"
2,I lost my lust for this novel,I don't know what happened. Mat is losing his role as a major character towards the end of this and Rand is becoming boring. The women are peevish and do not understand men as they thought they did. It make me angry to read this when the previous ones were terrific. I do hope that will change.
5,My son loves this series,I ordered the series for my son's Kindle. He loves the series. He is 13 but loves to read. Perfect for him.
4,"Great, as always, but not quite as strong...","Robert Jordan is incredible... This is by far the biggest, most complex fantasy series I've ever heard of. The great book, but I found it a few moments to be dragging, or focusing too much on just the intricate relationships for way to long. Other than those moments, I felt it was engaging and very well thought out!"
4,Still good even five books in.,FoH starts off strong and finishes like the rest of the series. If you have read book one just know it only gets better.
5,Wheel of Time,"I have read every book in this series so far and get completely sucked up into each volume. A great series with wonderful character development, excellent environment details and descriptions. A truly great series that everyone should read."
3,Someone save me from the women!,"The thing that ruins this book in this beautiful series is the fact that 90% of the book is Elayne and Nynaeve, as well as Egwene, complain and plot. After about 600 pages, you get utterly bored with Nynaeve's tempers and her tugging on her hair, and worying about how much clevage she is revealing.This book also goes through some major dry points in its plot. It goes from so boring that you want to cry, to relatively exciting, but since the previous parts are so brain numbingly boring, it makes the action scenes so much better.One more thing, what the heck is up with Robert Jordan and his obsession with naked women? He constantly describes Avienda (spelling?) naked, or getting dressed, and in other books as well... oh well. If you want to read the entire sieries... read this book out of nessesity, the 6th is great... oh! and the ending of this book is amazing as well!"
3,"Good, if u can get past Jordan's childish problem with women","OK, short and sweet cause you have already read the other 4 books.Like the other books in the series, The Fires of Heaven is intriguing, if u can get past Jordan's childish problem with women. The stroy line is wonderful, but it seems one can't get through a chapter with out a character commenting on ""Oh the opposite sex is stupid. We have to take them in hand."" However, the plot line is enjoyable and so is Jordan's formation of magic and how it is used. So if you can stand Jordan's view of women (which he should see a counselor for) then the rest of the book is a must read."
2,A step down from its predecessors,"I begin to get the sensations that many other reviewers have outlined from my reading of book 5. The pace seems to be slowing down, apart from the obligatory speed-up in the last 100 pages, there seems little in the way of action in this book. My interest level is ebbing, and book 12 looks a long way away from here. I start wondering if its time to quit, while Im ahead, so to speak.I believe around 500 pages could be cut from this volume.100 pages cut from Nynaeve's introspection / anger50 pages cut from Aes Sedai gossiping70 pages - the entire ""circus"" episode cut50 pages from Rand's repetitive thought processes50 pages from Elayne50 pages from EgweneThe remaining 130 pages could be cut from random clothing descriptions / minor characters who serve no plot purpose.This is not a good book. There, I've said it. Books 1-4 were good, but this is the first truly bad one. I will read book 6... but the jury is out."
4,Debating How Much I Liked This One,"I really love the series, and I feel like I know the characters-- they are even in my dreams! But I get irritated with the repetitive nature of the books, how Jordan is always reiterating things that we already know, such as: Nynaeve can only channel when she is angry (I don't know how many times I have read that!) and that she is much stronger than Egwene or Elayne, if she can channel at all! I get sick of it because I have read all of the books so far, and I manage to keep the characters in line-- I figure everyone else probably does, too. Also, I felt that there was something lacking in the fact that Perrin didn't make an appearance at all. But I guess I shouldn't complain-- the book was indeed impossible to put down, and I will be looking forward to starting #6 as soon as possible!"
2,This Volume Fulfilled My Growing Suspicions,"Yes! It was actually possible to write an entire, lengthy novel that is part of a long and ambitious series, and not substantially advance a single basic plot line. Just a string of overly descriptive chapters that moved characters around on vaguely defined or just unfinished business. What a depressing concept.I decided Jordan had essentially run out of ideas, yet he still seemed determined to stretch ""The Wheel of Time"" past ten or more titles.Willing to give the man one more chance, I confess I purchased ""Lord of Chaos,"" but gave up for good shortly after reading 100 pages when the paperback's binding failed and the book disintegrated. Since two of the previous books had shed their covers before I finished them, I decided this was a trend towards very cheaply made paperbacks stuffed with filler and fluff.Sadly, the series had become a waste of time and money."
4,Not his best work but still good,"This book is a slow moving plot line, like a giant freight train....."
2,The Last Battle is approaching rapidly- NOT!,"The story rolls ponderously along, gathering characters like fractures. While I like intricacy, and this series has it, the details are slow in coming- especially as this is yet another 1,000 page book (here editor, editor: come out come out wherever you are!). You often can skip whole pages and not loose the story thread. Character interactions reinforce my conviction that Jordan's philosophy is: trust no one, have no friends, and those you do you cannot confide in, and if you love someone, torment them mercilessly. The book jacket says he's married, but lists no kids... no wonder!"
4,The Best I have read so far,So far I have read all the books up to this one and it is so far the best I have read. The book whaen I read it plays like a movie in my head and is so intense in the most part that I couldn't put it down. You think you know what is going to happen next but 9 out of 10 times your wrong and if you do put the book down you'll be guessing what is going to happen untill you start reading again. This series being so long and but always actionpacked outdoes the Lord of the Ring. I recomend this book to anyone who likes fntasy and adventure cause it has it all.
2,A Question Of Pride,"I have never put down a book (actually, I have, once)I Have never left a series unfinishedI am leaving my third decadeI have read this book one and a half year ago. No one goes anywhere and they go slowly.I Will probably finish the series when i get to be around seventy, so I can say that I've finished it and go in peace with myself and maybe get Mr. Jordan's hidden message, which I seriously doubt.I am also posting this on book one, so no one goes unwarned, as the series started off pretty well.Shame."
5,I have found the Wheel of Time series totally engrossing.,"Being particularly fond of lengthy series, Robert Jordan delivers the goods. I didn't find out about the series until the eighth volume, but when I did I couldn't put them down. Just when the story gets you focused on one character, the perspective changes in such a way that another character is the central figure. I especially enjoy when they interract. I am also looking forward to the illumination to the allusions of this world perhaps being a time in our own very distant future (light bulbs, airplanes, even the original names of their notable historical figures). I can't wait to see where it's all going and am looking forward to ride."
4,An important part of a continueing series,"This is an interesting story line, I am glad it continues, there are many pieces of the puzzle that needs to fit together seamlessly. This is the second time reading the series, before all of the books were not available, I am glad to be able to continue the series."
4,Not bad,"Good book. The men don't understand women, women don't understand men banter gets old. Other than that it is a good book and a good series."
4,A step up from Shadow Rising,"After a couple of chapters to set the stage, the Rand plotline moves forward at breakneck pace throughout this volume and a number of important events take place (including the biggest mystery of all in this series!). My only complaints were that the Siuan/Min/Leane and Elayne/Nynaeve threads moved too slowly at times. However, the Elayne/Nynaeve thread still had some critical events take place. I truly enjoyed the Rand/Aviendha interaction, as I did Mat resisting the call of battle at first before giving in. The last 100-150 pages of this book are shattering, and really serve as the conclusion to the events from Shadow Rising. While it dips in parts, this is a solid four rated book and really makes you yearn for the next book."
4,Jordan continues to dazzle,"This book picks the pace back up after a slower fourth volume. Several subplots advance satifactorily here and the cast of characters continues to progress--familiar characters keep developing and new characters enter the story in ways that add to the overall narrative. If you feared that Jordan was beginning to stretch things out a bit in ""The Shadow Rising"" (as I was), this volume will allay those fears. Highly recommended to all who have read the first four books in the series."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This fifth Wheel of Time book goes a bit more widescreen.Mat, now being the general to beat all generals with his Bene Gesserit-general-specific type memory knowledge, is an obvious choice when you have a fairly heavy duty war to be fought.The only problem is, there is likely to be more than one, and in different places.Those sneaky Forsaken are still hanging around, too."
5,Second best book in the series.,"I'd have to rank this installment just behind the first book. Jordan's storytelling ability simply shines here. His interweaving of prophecy and history make this a page-turner. His look into Aiel society had me riveted. They are so intricate and so history-driven, it is amazing!!! Jordan's use of history and culture throughout the series make this a very interesting series, even though some of the books can be slow. Still, this book makes up for that fact many times over."
5,Quite possibly the greatest epic fantasies ever written,Some say hes good....some say hes great....some say hes bad....I say hes EXCELLENT!! RJ cant be topped on these books. Hes gets you interested then sucks you right in with these books. You can almost feel Saidin rush through your blood. 100 years from now they will be reading this.
2,I quit the series...and I want my spent hours of reading back,"Title says it all. I enjoyed the 1st-3rd book in series. Forth book sort of dragged. By the middle of this book I had to make a decision...keep going with an endless supply of boring pages and books ahead or throw in the towel. Let's face it, life's too short. If you want a thousand pages of satisfaction pick up the unabridged version of ""The Stand"". I'm afraid this doesn't do it.Think about it another way do you want to read over 5000 pages of a series that has mixed reviews from like minded fantasy readers?Cheers"
3,This is where it all fell apart for me...,"I started rereading the series because of the kindle releases. The long and short summary of my review is that this is where it all fell apart for me. I slogged through the remaining books until the excellent Gathering Storm, but Fires of Heaven is when the series noticeably became dragged down by the constant unnecessary detail, the confusing expanding plot threads, and the repetitive interactions of the characters. There are long stretches of this book that are mind numbing to read, unlike the previous four. From here on out, I began to live for the vanishingly infrequent moments that recaptured the magic of the first four books..."
4,"Good, and bad, I would give it three and a half if I could","This book is pretty good, but in some parts it drags. It is highly annoying, however, do to the fact that all the woman are constantly mad over nothing, and men are constantly slammed to the wall if they say 'what a nice day' about how subborn and stupid and wool headed they are. Then the whole thing with Nyneave tugging on her braid, I would like to tug it out of her head. She is always mad at someone, for no reason at all, and the only charcter you still like is Perrin because he's the only one who isn't whiny and makes dumb choices. The action is really good, when there is action, though the book could have been shortened to about 300 pages. But the whole channeling thing is cool, and it has great potential, lets just hope he can hold on to the same quality as the first four in the future."
5,Excellent Adventure Book,"The best way to summarize the way I felt after reading this book is jealous! The concept seemed so simple: to voyage the complete length of the world's fifth longest river, yet it is unbelievable that in the 21st century no one had done it before them. I thought all the firsts had been done! This book isn't just about rapids, waterfalls, and man against the elements, it is also very insightful and Angus does a wonderful job of portraying the varied characters that the team encounters in remotest Mongolia and Siberia. This book is a Bryson meets Hyerdhal: it is humorous, interesting and very exciting. Definite thumbs up!"
1,nice effort sad results,"Althought the writter is taking a look at an interesting part of aviation and US history there are too many technical and typographical errors, the quality of the pictures is lacking and could have been better. this really took a lot away from a great subject. the older material is much better presented than the more recent parts. not your usual quality work from Schiffer Books."
1,Dream is NOT a delirium,"Hobson does not understand the topic he is studying. Dream is not at all a ""delirium"" but a very complex organisation of consciousness."
3,Its a good read.,But it could have gotten to the point sooner. I felt that it kind of dragged. I loved the story line because it was a new and inventive idea of being a temporary corporate wife. This is my first time reading her work. I would read something of her's again if there was no other book I wanted to read.
2,Dog won`t eat them,"It`s a good product but my dog won`t eat them. I purchased 2-3 packs, will probably donate them to a shelter. Too bad , I really wanted her to have a healthy treat."
2,Emanuelle Around the World,"Acting was poor and contrived, much of the plot centered around violence towards women"
5,Westcott 6-in-1,Awesome product & I got it $60 off the normal pricing anywhere else. Westcott has the best reflectors out there!
4,Funny coming-of-age tale,"Eoin Colfer, better known for his Artemis Fowl books, has created a sympathetic and believable character in Benny. My 12 year-old daughter and I both completely enjoyed the Irish setting, the humour, and the adventures of Benny and his ""business partner"" and possible love interest, Babe."
4,MBA book for a strategy class,This book is for an MBA class. Its a Hardcover and in good condition. I am very pleased with this purchase. Delivery was timely.
1,Same Old Stuff,"I was very disappointed with this book. It was repiticious of many other books of the type. Someday I'd like to see something beyond ""Anna Karenina"" as the top book in the lists. I won't recommend this book. Many others are better."
4,Enjoyed browsing this,"This is a fun book to flip through. I'd argue that the least interesting thing about it is the actual Top Ten. That's not a surprising list, and considering the math used to get there any Top Ten list by any group of people (from a similar pool in terms of nationality and ethnicity) would look pretty similar.What's fun about this is checking out the individual lists by individual authors. I was often surprised by some of the picks, and actually came away from it with a slightly altered opinion about some of the recommenders. I think it's more interesting to start at the bottom end - the books that only got one recommendation - and move forward from there.Interesting. But it's not meant to be definitive. I think everyone involved knew that. Take it as a light, intelligent read, with some things you'll agree with and others that you'll shake your head at."
3,Interesting Reading,"This is a very interesting book about top ten best books by several dozens of living writers (125 to be exact). According to what they chose, the book presents the number one top ten list with the ten best books, and then the list by every one of the writers. Once in a while there is a very useful and appreciated section called ""Appreciation of so and so boo,"" which gives the opportunity to the writer to explain in further detail one of his/her choices. This gives an insight to the reader about the book at hand, so we can decide if that would be a reading we would be interested in. The second part is a very short description of every book that appears on the lists, organized by the times they have been mentioned.The appendixes are: literary number games (by centuries, authors, nationalities, and some genres); index of authors; and index to book descriptions.Not an essential reading, but interesting for those who may be looking to discover new readings. I recommend it."
3,The surprising choices worth the price of the book,"I browsed through this book a few weeks back during a bookstore visit and put it back on the shelf. My quick assessment found it tediously monotonous, with all the writers picking the same few classics.I couldn't pass it up for two dollars at a book sale, however. It did read with deadly repetition for the majority of the book: Macbeth...Macbeth...Macbeth...Middlemarch...Middlemarch...Middlemarch...War and Peace...War and Peace...War and Peace.It was the surprises, the little known favorites, that I found to be worth the price of the book, the So Long, See You Tomorrows, The Man Who Loved Childrens, the Quartet in Autumns. I love to hear about other people's favorite books....It should be written under their name on a tag when meeting new people....inscribed on t-shirts....emblazoned on business cards....added to signature lines...."
3,The Documents in the Case,Customer service of company was excellent! I am disappointed in the book because the plot was thin and very predictable.
4,"Highly Clever, Highly underated, Highly enjoyable","John Carpenter takes a welcome change of pace with this invisible man movie that bring great new ideas to the genre. (best of all being that chevys clothes become invisible too so he doesn't have to walk around naked) Chevy Chase is suprisingly beleivable in the title role and Sam Neil is great as a rouge CIA agent. As you probably quessed, the special effects are also brilliant."
3,Finally coming to DVD,"The last John Carpenter film to be released on DVD, ""Memoirs of an Invisible Man"" bombed at the box office during it's early 90's theatrical run. Shame too as it's a better film than some think.The special effects were outstanding, and Sam Neill stole the show as the villian. Chevy Chase tries his best but even semi-dramatic roles are just not his thing.The DVD will be 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen (as all Carpenter films should be presented), and will have a behind-the-scenes featurette, outtakes, and the film's trailer. The sad thing is, no Carpenter commentary track. Why Warner Brothers never bothered to ask Carpenter to take part, we can only guess.Buy this DVD and complete your John Carpenter collection!"
1,memoirs of an invisible man,"i ordered the movie (cd)-memoirs of an invisible man with chevy chase. i received it here in tulsa,ok and mailed it to baton rouge, la. only to discover it had a big scratch in it. i was very disappointed to hear this and dont know the procedure to follow , to fix this. i would be very hesitant to order anything else from here."
2,NOT QUITE A THRILLER OR A COMEDY,"The Chevy Chase film, the barely seen MEMOIRS OF AN INVISIBLE MAN (Warner Home Video) was assumed by moviegoers to be a comedy in the tradition of Ghost Busters, is instead a rather serious film that Chase believed would establish him as a dramatic actor. Director John Carpenter's curious adaptation of the Invisible Man concept has cool effects and an unexpected story that is closer to a thriller than a comedy."
1,terrible adaptation of.........,"a very good book. Much like Bonfire of the Vanities, this was horribly miscast and butchered. How this ever fell into the hands of John Carpenter and Chevy Chase, I'll never understand. Someone else mentioned that Harrison Ford would have been better cast as the central character and I think that's pretty much dead on but the screenplay would have to have been trashed and put in the hands of someone who wanted to create something that actually represented the original and also in the hands of a more capable director. John Carpenter may be good at what he does but he was way out of his depth with this and was probably incapable of controlling Chase. Bottom line, the books very good if not great and the movie is a huge disappointment that really sucks. On the other hand, if you're a big Chase fan, go for it."
3,Carpenter's worst is better than most,"No, this is NOT John Carpenter's finest hour but even at his worst, he can make a better film than most of the dreck we see today.Chevy Chase plays it straight here (thank god) but it's Sam Neill (playing a nefarious government agent) who steals the show.Like most Carpenter fans, we want ALL of his movies on DVD but Warner Brothers has yet to release this on DVD yet. If you want ""Memoirs..."" on DVD, please write them a letter and ask for it. Here's their address;Warner Home Video4000 Warner Blvd.Burbank, CA 91522"
4,FUNNY!,I love this movie but wish they had it in DVD form. One of Chevy's best movies and they special effects are exceptional.
3,"Fun, but the book was better","This was a fun movie, and a good vehicle for Chevy Chase's humor, but I liked the book for its more realistic treatment of the problems that an invisible man would have (like the little bits of food that are visible after he eats, and keeping track of his one set of invisible clothes)"
2,never buy a refurbished product again,"the product came dusty , greasey and small marks on the wood, thanks for a poor quality product.I will never buy a refurbished product again or recomend this chair to anyone!"
2,Arrived AGAIN missing parts.,T-Handle used to regulate pressure was missing. This was the second regulator I received in this condition. External packaging was good but bubble pack regulator came in was open. There is a bubble in the packaging for the T-Handle but none was in the box. Returned for a replacement.
3,Unbelievable Motives,"I fould the book to be entertaining. However, I thougth the author did not develop Dr. Spier's character in a believable way. In particular, Dr. Spier's actions seemed too outrageous and other than to move the plot along, I just did not understand his motives or circumstances for acting the way he did.Also, having Ed Pinkerton's character just magically accomplish various feats for Dr. Spier seemed a little too convenient. I would have liked to see a more creative development of the plot.Having said that, it was a quick read and the action was entertaining."
4,4 1/2 Stars,See storyline aboveA top-notch thriller with graphic scenes of the emergency room (and Clydes room) with highly descriptive and obviously well researched treatments. It's a story of one doctor's personal ethics. It's a story that packs a lot of suspense with a lot of personal issues. The pace stays fairly strong throughout the story with just an occasional lag.Recommended
3,Failure to execute,"This book has an interesting premise. There is a serial alkali thrower terrorizing nurses and doctors at a hospital. Of course, the mixed up fellow has motives for what and why he is doing this.The plot meanders on for a while and then takes a number of unexpected twists and turns. It is rather odd that the main character who is so good at figuring out some things can seem to be so brain dead when it comes to basic don't go down that blind alley.Finally, the ending did not have the kind of bang you'd expect from this kind of book."
1,Pure Drivel,"Such babbling nonsense. After the first couple of chapters the book becomes an unrealistic and inane read. Overly moralistic Super Doctor tracks down serial alkali thrower. Who is next on his list? Bin Laden? I usually do not bother to write negative reviews, but I could not pass the opportunity with this one."
5,"MAMA CASS, WE MISS YOU!","This is probably the best collection of Mama Cass I've seen. It's labeled as an import, but I've seen it in mainstream music/book stores. What an incredible loss, the death of Mama Cass, but what an incredible array of music she left behind! This is a wonderful compilation and one can't help but wonder how far she could have gone with that one-of-a-kind voice! Keep in mind that only her solo work is represented here, not her work with the Mamas and the Papas. Great listen!"
4,A Good Cass Compilation,"This CD contains most of the songs from her 2nd solo album in 1969, and the various singles that were compiled on the 1970 "" Mama's Big One's "" collection. Slanted towards the great pop songs Cass recorded, and missing the more artistic statements & ballads from her solo debut album in 1968. Hence not the best representative collection of her recordings, but good nonetheless as Cass always sang great. Her powerhouse version of the Laura Nyro ballad "" HE'S A RUNNER "" contains one of the best vocals that Cass ever recorded."
4,A great resource book,"This is a great book, it has actual photos with the meridians drawn over top of them. The downside is all the points along the meridians are not specified, only popular points for certain conditions. The other great book to compliment this one is called ""Accu-Cat' (or dog etc), which has drawings of the meridians with each point indicated."
3,Not for Doctors of TCM (There Are Better Books),"Although I must say that this is a well-written book, and very useful for those people who don't know much about Traditional Chinese Medicine, the author did not seem to have an in-depth knowledge about TCM.Filled with little mistakes that can mislead a practitioner, I'd recommend picking up a different text to learn from. (For example, the author refers often to ""Kidney Blood,"" which is NOT a term used in Chinese Medicine.)Fun to read, but too inaccurate for an alternative medical doctor."
3,This practical guide assists them well a neophyte's need in veterinary acupuncture.,"It is a simple and easy book of understanding, of the way that the students, in his course beginning, need to understand the Chinese medicine. But for a professional acupunturist he also has his usefulness, because that the part 3 on treatment serves more commonly as a fast guide of treatment for the diseases found. Its serves as a book of incomes. In spite of knowing that the Chinese medicine seeks the treatment of the patient and not of the disease in itself, trying to balance the patient, nevertheless, as a first treatment this book aids the professional to give the first steps. I recommend a lot of this book to students of veterinary Chinese medicine and the acupunturists that are in the beginning of his professional life as acupunturist."
4,Pet lover's cup of tea,"I havent used this much, but I still think it is a great reference. I have done acupuncture and herbs for dogs with measurable success. Any acupuncturist is capable of this, so if you need more assurance, buy the book!"
3,Kh,I used to think that the device works Celsius temperature but when I received surprised that Fahrenheit temperature But the device acceptable.
2,Still looking for a good product,"If I wanted to get inaccurate readings that are consistently 3 to 5 degrees wrong, then I made a good purchase. I thought that I was purchasing a valuable household item, but all I really got was a lot of ""Hyper-reaction"" from a family believing they were all really sick!Thanks for the memory!"
3,On a Wing and a Dale,"Nope. Sorry, but I am just not as rapturous as fellow reviewers about the Wingdale's debut. There's nothing amiss with the set, and the songs are fine enough. But none of them are memorable. I admit I was lured to sample the product having swooned over Moody's, 'Purple America' and this is simply not a distinguished showcase of his writing skills. While his best writing compares favourably with contemporary American literature, the music herein drowns amongst hundreds of similar aspirants. It's a capable outfit, without sounding any bells."
1,clear but shallow,"Roochnik's 20 years of study has revealed a clear but shallow book on Plato; he forges his ""techne"" glasses on everything he touches leaving the reader with no clear understanding of what Socratic wisdom consists of. His Plato becomes boring and uninsightful. Readers should skip this book and go directly to Strauss or Bloom for a clear and meaningful understanding of PLatonic wisdom."
2,"Highly prejudiced, dissident writes with ax to grind","All throughout the book, Mr. Dwyer betrays his own prejudices and sourness toward the Catholic Church. His Jesuit training comes through, which is not all bad, but at times gets in the way of objectivity. No Saint is given that title, nor is any pope titled Pope. Are you Catholic, or not, Mr. Dwyer? If you have a chip on your soulder about the church, write about that, but not church history. Also, you misrepresent western monasticism and Saint Benedict, either purposely, or through neglect. Likewise, you misrepresent St. Therese of Lisieux, comparing her with Luther. Are you unaware of her devotion to the Blessed Mother? Mostly, the book is on the politics of the papacy, with a sprinkling of other developments in church history. You don't seem to be outright anti-Catholic, but obviously infected with a lot of negativity, which, unfortunately, overshadows what truth you would present."
2,Rude Customer Service,"I was impressed with the online reviews and the specifications of this handy external drive. However, it failed (as in very dead) during my first use, backing up my MacBook. Two different customer service reps were very rude as we were trying to diagnose the fault. And it was a toll call. Smartdisk does not provide toll-free customer support. Eventually they gave me an RMA (return merchandise authorization). It took them about 2 weeks to send me a replacement - a refurbished unit; one that had definitely been used a lot (I asked for a new one since my original one died after about 20 minutes of use; but they refused). I know I won't be buying from SmartDisk again."
3,"SmartDisk FWFL80 80GB Firelite 2.5"" Firewire External Hard Drive","Nice drive. Problem when daisy chain two drive together. XP will lose connection with the two drives. I guess it draw too much power and the firewire can't handle it. As a result, the drives shut themselves down."
2,Terrible,"This thing broke down on me, believe it or not, three times and I'm on my fourth one. I'm glad they replaced it, but the last time they gave me a USB hardrive instead of a firewire. It never lasted me for over a year. And guess what? This fourth one just messed up. And they don't have a toll free number so you have to pay. You also have to pay to ship it out there and they want you to ship it fedex which if I added up all three times I returned this product for another used one, I could have gotten a brand new hardrive.I would not recommend this product for those who have important documents that need to be saved and transported somewhere else and have it fail.Lucky me, I backed up my stuff on a good old reliable CD :)Oh and by the way, I always disconnect everything by ""safely removing"" it and I have XP in case anyone wanted to know."
4,BUY THIS VIDEO!,"If you don't know Wagner's Ring, this is the perfect Introduction. The massive 15 hour opera can be extremely confusing, this video is a very good synthesis. Of course they talk about the symbolysm of the story and characters, and most of it is good, but if you really want to know about the cosmic events occuring in the story, you should read the works of Madamme Blavatsky, Rudolf Steiner, Samael Aun Weor.The video has a lot of visuals and musical excerps from the Ring, great for beginners or heavy Wagnerians."
4,may be usefull for a workshops of a wagner society,"We believe this film to be useful not only for the initiation of neophytes and clearer understanding of the ""Ring"", but also for the attraction of new members and further dissemination of ""Der Ring des Nibelungen"". This tutorial and video guide is highly suitable not only for private viewing, but for workshops and video screening as well. Moreover this film is a very efficient fund raising instrument with prospective sponsors. It entices the spectator to the magic of Wagnerian music."
4,Enlightening perspective,Grossman was a Soviet Jew who as a Red Army journalist was on the front lines of some of the most horrific battles of the Second World War. He experienced both Stalingrad and Kursk and was in Berlin when the War in Europe ended. His account of Treblinka was detailed and sobering. This book is a compilation of his journal notes and excerpts from letters describing his day to day experiences. Any reader interested in the Eastern front will find this title worthwhile.
5,Rubber Hits The Road Ruring Russia's War,"Grossman's frontline dispatches are organised in sequence by the two editor/translators. These are gritty vignates about the soldiers at the front. Grossman is much more interested in the men than the commanders. He interviews them all, but his heart is with the men.The intervening commentary by the editors is very helpful in understanding the context of these passages."
4,WW II - the Russian viewpoint,"Very interesting account of the ""Eastern Front"" by a Russian writer who was on the front lines from the summer of 1941 through the surrender of Berlin in 1945. Some of the best chapters include the battle at Stalingrad and the Russians discovery of the ""Final Solution"" at Treblinka. Most books I've read about WW II were written by western authors, but this relates the Russian experience. I recommend it to those interested in the history of that period. Other than ""The Rise And Fall of The Third Reich"", the best book I've read about this war."
1,toxic stuff,"Because of the bleach, it may indeed be an effective cleaner, but use at your own risk. The fumes are among the most toxic of any cleaner I've ever used. Is it worth it to your (and your family's) health?"
2,used the stuff before and its good,"I have used the arm and hammer scrub free bathroom cleaner before and it is really good. As its name suggest scrub free. I sprayed the stuff on, left it for a few mins and WOW!All i had to do was rinse over with water. Its a litle expensive but worth it. A lot of us dont have the time and need something potent that works. My con has to do with the supplier, I ordered specifically Arm and Hammer, just love Arm and Hammer products, BUT sender took really long to send the product and when they did SENT THE WRONG PRODUCT!!!"
3,outdated,"The biggest drawback for this title is Gall & de Waal's story ends with the chechen recapture of Grozny in 1996 and the subsequent peace treaty. It fails to follow the story through the Chechen terrorist bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow and the Russian military response.So for anyone that is used to sorting out the liberal US media, identifying the authors' allegiance to the Chechen cause is surmountable; knowing that their story is painfully outdated is more important to a prospective buyer."
3,Decent (but skewed) Overview,"This book is a decent introduction for non-specialists who didn't necessarily follow events as they were unfolding a few years ago. However, to its discredit I have to say that it is clearly pro-Chechen, almost to the point of being propaganda in some places. The authors seem to buy into the romantic, historical image of the Chechen freedom fighter, but only emphasize the atrocities committed by the Russians. I suppose that's an occupational hazard faced by war journalists who spend a lot of time covering a conflict among the forces of one side. After all, every point of view has limitiations."
4,Excellent survey of the Chechen Conflict,"I found this book an excellent survey of the causes, conduct, and results of the Chechen conflict. The only distracting item is that the authors switch from the third person to the first person,without any transition, when recalling interviews or situations while they were in Chechnya. This book is a must for students of contemporary history of Chechnya, Russia, and the Russian military's ineffectiveness in this conflict. This story is far from over and this book helps one understand how the Russians and the Chechens got to where they are today."
4,Reads like a Thriller,If you're interested in the first war in Chechnya everything's here including the holocaust against the Chechen people. It ends in 1998 before Putin's KGB war and the Chechens' descent into terrorism. If your pro-Russian this book is not for you. The writers are not pro-Yeltsin either. (Who is? He was just a drunk.)
3,Perfect for me,"These are expensive dog kennels, I got that. But I have a special use for them, I use them in the baggage area of my 4 seat airplane. I put it in there, pop it up and my lab. is eager to jump right in and off we go. I like it as the dog has plenty of ventilation and the mesh screens keep dog hair in the kennel."
2,The thing is huge. Too huge for a car. Put on your 18 wheeler!,I guess it is my fault for not checking the size.It is too huge to put on the back of my jetta.Go Jets!
1,Not what I was expecting,"I originally purchased this postcard book to share with friends who were interested in quilts and I was terribly disappointed when I discovered the cards are not pictures of ACTUAL Amish Quilts. Instead, they are computer generated patterns of Amish quilit patterns. (Low quality generated pictures, at that.) Not even worth the $1.50 I paid for it."
1,Too much for too little,"I am a big reader of non-fiction and historical fiction. Other reviewers found this book to be inspiring and poetic. I found it to be depressing and verbose. This entire book could have been written in 6 sentences. It takes her nearly 30 pages to introduce the town. You don't know who the main character is until nearly that far into the book.I read this book for a class on international literature, and the whole class agreed you should stay away from this book. Other books like ""Things Fall Apart"" will give you a more practical look at life in colonial Africa."
4,New insight,I'm a United Methodist. This book offers a new refreshing view of the material. I do recommend it.
2,poor,"Poor, poor, poor, about as interesting as the verses attributed to Jesus that remain in the Bible. One of the things we did not buy."
3,"Great show, bad CD","""Goes Forth"" is great, and all the best things said in the other reviews apply. However, on DVD the laugh track is too loud, especially in episode one, where it really interferes. There are two areas in the extra features section which are ""buggy"": the narration in the Historical References as well as Cast Information cuts off halfway through the narration in each and every item or cast member except the 2 or 3 that are under 10 seconds long. $&@# annoying!"
1,Terrible Canned Laughter,"This was a wonderful series, but the canned laughter on this DVD is not the same as when broadcast and absulutely awful."
5,Classic. Comedy at its best!,"Full of great jokes and all the characters are memorable and outstanding. It's my favorite of the series, possibly favorite of any comedy series. And after all the jokes and sarcasm, there is this amazing scene at the very end that gives me goosebumps because it's so beautiful and really makes you feel the tragedy of war and the loss of lives. A series to watch again and again."
3,Music - the way I like it!,I really enjoy David Wilson's musical interpretations of some of the old and new classics. It's soothing and reminds my husband and I of some great fun times.
4,Pink Got His,"Pink Anderson's ""I Got Mine"" and ""Travelin' Man"" are both fantastic. However, the rest of the material on this disc is not quite as great as the stuff on the first and third volumes of Anderson's recordings on the Bluesville label. That is the sole reason I'm giving this disc four stars, and not five. Pink's few recordings with Simmie Dooley from the heyday of Country Blues are fantastic, and one should definitely seek them out. Listen to Frank Stokes' ""I Got Mine"" and then Pink's version. They are quite different, but both are highly memorable."
5,Inspirational Blues Artist; SYD BARRETT named 'PINK' FLOYD,"This blues album is very high quality blues! Pink Andersoninspired Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd, to so entitle the psychedelic rockband, fighting off other titles such as the abdabs, and sigma 6, syd named his band after Pink Anderson, this legendary blues artist who's music is found here, and Floyd Council, yet another blues artist, thus coming up with Pink Floyd.This album will be something that will stick with you for life, and you ears will be blessed with the great blues sound of the south.Simon recommends this album, and a great buy here at Amazon.Com."
2,Rambling and Nonsensical,Notwithstanding my wife'e love for Vonnegut and his many successful books I struggled through Breakfast of Champions and finished it without having any sense for what it was about. It was confusing and pointless with no character or plot development.
5,You Have To Get It,"I've seen a lot of luke warm and downright negative responses so I had to add my own review. Let me just say. . .you have to ""get it."" If you do not appreciate sarcasm, satire, and brutal honestey then you don't need to pick up a Vonnegut book. Admittedly they are not for everyone, but for those of us who find ourselves delighted with Vonnegut's simple, in your face style his books become like potato chips; you can never just have one."
2,Vonnegut's worst?,"I am a huge Vonnegut fan. I have read them all. This was one of the last that I read, and by far my least favorite. I barely got through it. DO NOT start reading Vonnegut with this book. Start with Slaughterhouse Five or something else, and save Cat's Cradle for last....."
4,Classic Vonnegut,"My favorite part about this book are the drawing by Vonnegut that you find through out the book. ""Breakfast of Champions"" is classic Vonnegut and with the exception of the drawings, is a great lismus test for reads who are curious with whether or not they will like Vonnegut. However, do NOT watch the movie as it is terrible. Enjoy the book."
5,Breakfast of Champions-Eat it how you like!,"It is incredible. As you are faced with tragic, disturbed, and ignorant characters, you must realize that there are people like this in the world. All minds do not work alike, and all minds will find something different in Vonnegut's prose. You can pick it up one day and laugh, another and feel horrible about human nature, another and be baffled, or even just shake your head at its cleverness. However you see it, Kurt does it right. I haven't read this for years, but it is a novel that will always be a five-starer for me. I wonder what I will think when I read it next?"
2,Vonnegut has no subtlety,"I'll admit I only got about 50 pages into this book, so I can't offer the most informed opinion. But from what I read, this book is little more than garbage. I read ""Cats Cradle"" and enjoyed it. I didn't agree with everything in it but it was very clever and subtle. This on the other hand, has no subtlety. It reads like the lyrics to a rage against the machine song. Just pure liberal ranting about how everything established in America is wrong. Also, his drawings seem like a cop out, an excuse not to describe something. If you want to read good satire, read Heller, or John Kennedy Toole. This book is a lemon."
1,I agree with the other 1 star reviews.,"Despite what others would have me believe, I do not remember chuckling, much less laughing, at any moment while reading this book. I just kept patiently waiting for a story, or even a point, to surface, but after finishing the Epilogue I didn't find either."
1,"so it goes, and so on, and so on...","Kurt Vonnegut is a snake oil salesman. His writing is so pretentious, self-referential, and nihilistic that you can't help but despise Vonnegut personally and despise even more the intellectuals and professors who praise him religiously.Breakfast of Champions is no different than the rest of his work. He randomly inserts inane facts to be funny, like the size of male characters' organs once he introduces them. These can come at any moment, so you have to be prepared for them. The book is extremely vulgar in that the obscenities have no redeeming value. There is no genuine emotion behind them.The plot? There is none that makes any sense. Furthermore, Vonnegut partakes in America bashing for the first 10 pages and comes across as a Communist, which made me nearly put the book down, but I muscled through the rest of it on a long airplane ride.Completely unenjoyable. No redeeming value. One of the worst books I've ever read."
1,No longer relevant,"This review is for the audio CD version of the novel. I read the book for the first time 20+ years ago. At the time, we lived in a different world. As a teenager, I thought Vonnegut was cool, and I devoured this novel. 20+ years later, I can no longer stomach it. Back when it was hip to bash American and all it stands for, this book seemed important. I can see now that it is not. Don't bother reading this."
1,Wow...what a racist book!,"One thing about the author is, he loves the ""n-word"" and he hates blacks. I never could understand how people who call themselves imaginative creators take such pride in alienating select audiences. Don't you want people to buy the darn book??? You effectively killed your black audience, Kurt. Now, I'm a smart man with a high tolerance for stupidity and wacked opinions and am often able to find art in the sublime. From another black man's promptings, I bought the book and read it. I was disgusted. No doubt, Quentin Tarrantino is clammoring for the rights to make the film. If you don't like blacks and you're the type of person who feels that nobody ever gets your jokes, this ""book"" is for you."
2,SEE THE MOVIE,"I didn't read the book, but I saw the movie (which by the way filmed near my hometown). It stars Bruce Willis as the wacky Dwane Hoover. the movie to me was OK"
4,Quick shipping,"The book arrived in 3-4 days, nice packaging; but was not in the condition described. The binding was broken and the cover was attached, but dangling. The cover was also slightly soiled and some of the pages fragile, but it's an acceptable condition."
4,Good,This book is classic Vonnegut. It is fun to read and has great satire. It isn't very grabbing as some other stories are and there is not much plot but it is still a great read.
4,vonnegut is cool,"This is a pretty clever darn book. It seems real simple, but if you tried to write it yourself, you'd find that having all the bits fit into each other (eventually) would be real tricky. I liked ""Slaughterhouse Five"" better, though. It's fun reading more of Vonnegut's books, because characters from other stories do cameo appearances and things like that. Thumbs up!"
5,breakfast of champions.,"a hilarious novel, great for someone who has never read vonnegut before. it's the kind of book that you'll want to read at least twice to make sure you caught everything. vonnegut love. m'm."
5,Supposedly Vintage Vonnegut,"but I wouldn't know because this is the only book by Vonnegut that I've read. It's a great book, maybe the best I've read, but Catcher in the Rye and Salem's Lot come close. I'm not gonna say how old I am, because no one would take my comments seriously, but I'm young. It is a great book for people at a young age, but seriously not for the D-student. It's somewhat complex, and in a way philosophical. Vonnegut has constructed a masterfull book full of dry humor and sarcastic wit, but it's serious. Make sure you understand that this isn't a parody, it's an insight into our society. With the pictures of ""wide open beavers"", you may wonder what the hell Kurt was on when he wrote this, but I doubt he was out of it, it all works well together in the end. Anyway, I'm dawdling, so in short, read the book if you think you can."
1,Didn't get it!,"Sorry, I just didn't get it. I liked Slaughter House Five. Vonnegut shows many signs of being a brilliant writer, even though I didn't understand the story. I knew much of it was satire, I just wish I could understand it. Since this is a very simple book to read I would actually recommend it, despite my low score."
1,Gagged,"I'd say it was a book purposely written stupidly to appear clever. I found it extremely dull. I gagged out 1/2 way through it. I gurantee I can write better than this. If an unknown author had submitted this story to a publisher, it would have been returned with a rejection form letter."
1,Preface >> Rest of Book,"I disliked the book mostly on the way it was written. It was suppose to be funny or something, but I didn't find anything that funny. The part that turned me off was the writing style. Donnie did this Donnie did that, it was cute for a little bit, but I got very tired of it. I am unsure of what Kurt Vonnegut's style usually is, but if it is anything like this, I don't believe I will read another one of his books. I am a fan of ranting, and get to listen to a lot of good ones, but the style got in the way of all the fun. Yeah and it only took like 2 hours to read the entire thing. I normally don't review, but this one bothered me enough to.If you do read books only for the preface, this is your book. I thought the preface was quite entertaining...too bad it wasn't longer and the entire plot of the book."
4,Pokes fun at Magazine Scfi,"Sarcastic take on the perception of early magazine scfi writing before Vonnegut moves onto other stuff. Strong on irony and as it written in 1973 quite environmental as well. Appeals to my twisted humour anyhow - best judged by reading the Sirens of Titan.Story: Dysfunctional society and how some make it, and others go crazy seen though Dwayne, a car dealer and Kilgore Trout famous author to two fans on a trip to an arts festival across America."
3,A Fun & Easy Read,This book is perfect for reading in short bursts whenever you have a minute. It's broken up into so many small sections that you can practically start and stop on any page without losing your place. It has a rambling plot that presents an interestingly different viewpoint of the world around us.
5,Excellent Novel!,"As an avid fan of Kurt Vonnegut, I love all the novels I have ever read by him. However, Breakfast of Champions stands out above and beyond as my favorite. Complete with Vonnegut's classic, almost childish drawings and an appearance by the author himself, this book is truly amazing. Vonnegut tells it all like it is, from Thomas Jefferson to Christopher Columbus. This book truly is a rare masterpiece from beginning to end, and I would greatly recommend it for anyone who likes to have a good, honest laugh at life and all its ups and downs."
4,Breakfast of Champions,"Hilarious little book, and a quick read too. If you like Vonnegut's other books and haven't read this one, you will want to read it. The illustrations are great!"
5,Breakfast of Champions book,"Break fast of Champions book. You can get -lots of hard-to-find titles! Great price, fast ship, highly recommend . A++"
5,Listen: This is a one-of-a-kind book.,"The first Vonnegut book i read was Slaughterhouse-five, then Cats Cradle, and i have to say, breakfast of champions is just as good. I read breakfast of champions in one night, the second i picked it up i could not put it down. Kurts prose is so unlike any other author, although i did find som similarities between this book and Sluaughterhouse-Five. The way he reapeats certain phrases to get them stuck in your head or just to create an overall feeling, in SH-5 it was ""so it goes"" diminishing the impact of death on the reader for the insight that that person is not really dead but just ina bad place at that moment. And in Breakfast of champions he often end paragraphs with ""and so on"" which he himself makes note of in the the book, because like the plastic material that permeates the creek in his book and life in general it just keeps going on an on and on and so on, for ever and ever and ever ECT."
3,Not his best (in my opinion),"Although this book has it's high points, like Vonnegut's humorous observations about America, it isn't as good as Cat's Cradle or Slaugherhouse-Five. The reason for this is because the author literally tells you how the book ends, numerous times. Very disappointing."
5,My second favourite Vonnegut!,"Although I have have only read three Vonnegut novels so far, this is my 2nd favourite out of all three. (Slaughterhouse-five being my favourite.) It's story tells of Dwayne Hoover, a car salesman who is slowly going insane, and of course Kilgore Trout, the science fiction writer whose on his way to Dwayne's home, Midland city, to an arts festival he's just been invited too. My favourite part is the ending. Now I won't spoil it for you, but when I finished the book I felt the ending to be quite dissapointing, but I thought about it for awhile and decided I loved afterwards. Vonnegut creates a beautiful portrait of insanity and humour in this brilliant piece of fiction!!!"
3,Alright.,"Maybe I had Vonnegut fatigue when reading this right after Slaughterhouse 5, but it was a bit of a let down and was tiresome to read at times. It is an interesting presentation of someone going on a rampage, though."
4,Very good but I'm guessing there is better,This was my first Kurt Vonnegut book. For a first it was good but not great. I'm sure that if I had read other books and understood all of the references it would've been better...
5,Another thing I had forgotten,"I think that many spend to much time on the words of Vonnegut when his real talents are so easily found in the art work on the pages of this classic. Should you think not, you most assuredly have been portrayed in one of these!!!! (FUNNY STUFF I DON""T CARE WHO YOU ARE!) Vonnegut that is!!"
3,A review looks like this:,"If you enjoy bawdy, ludicrous theories, and can deal with the Vonnegut's roller-coaster mental track, this may be an interesting read.Initially I found it to be too chaotic in organization, subjecting the reader to Vonnegut's tangential attention span. But one could argue, as most of Vonnegut's cult-like followers do, that this within itself offers an original style in American literature. After 100 pages I put the book down out of a lack of interest (and out of respect to the author since I didn't want to end his last book on my booklist on a sour note) only to pick it back up when the characters, as well as Vonnegut's style, beckoned my subconscious.You either hate it or love it, there is no in-between and sometimes its a combination of both. Not recommended as in introduction to Vonnegut, but definitely a must for those inclined to visit his innovative universe."
3,Minimalism of champions,This was my first visit with Kurt Vonnegut. I'm keen now tospend some more time with him although I'll be surprised if he sticksto this spare style in his other books. The drawings in my edition ofthe book are a bit out of place ... but the book shows that you can betremendously effective without big words and flowery prose.
2,A Waste of Time,"Breakfast of Champions is the first Kurt Vonnegut I've read. I hate to say it but I was not too impressed. I was hoping for a book that would be challenging. What I got was a book that used infantile humor in the guise of satire to try to impress the reader on just how clever the author is. If he has a main point, it seems to be that we are all empowered individuals and that all others are there to act as robots to interfere/interface with our lives. This viewpoint is just too cynical and cold for this reader. I very much doubt hat I will be reading any other of Vonnegut's works."
3,Vonnegut...not quite at his best.,"I picked up Breakfast of Champions at a local used bookstore and I read the book not knowing quite what to expect. This isn't Vonnegut's best...but it most certainly isn't his worst.Breakfast of Champions isn't a philosophical book--it's just a book to read, to make you think a bit, but for the sake of precious time don't sit around and analyze it.Breakfast of Champions offers a somewhat accurate account of society, and I'll always admire Vonneguts satire and bitter realism but I think ol Kurt went a little too far with the whole ""bad chemicals"" situation--which became bothersome after several pages of this bleak denial of responsibility.Breakfast of Champions--a quick, humourous read (love those doodles), but nothing to take very seriously.~Leann~"
3,Controlled Lunacy!,"Three stars is a good rating for me. Rarely do I give 4 or more. That said, I thought the first 2/3 of this book was absolutely hysterical. Yes, it was juvenile. Yes, it was even infantile at times, but it was fun. If you're looking for a light hearted read, and you like satire, then this is the book for you. Vonnegut has the ability to make us laugh at what we are, when most would waddle in the misery and wretchedness of human behavior. A WARNING: this is not a book for the politically correct."
5,Delightful and Marvelous,"This book is marvelous. It completely changed the way I look at literature and life in general. In his narrative Vonnegut has taken everything you expect about the way fiction should be written, put it in a blender, and beaten the blender into oblivion with a baseball bat. Do yourslef a favor and buy this, right now."
2,I'm baffled.,"I really meant one star, but I didn't want to be immediately labeled as one of those idiots who gives great books a 1 merely because everyone else threw 5's. Breakfast of Champions, though, was self-indulgent, insubtle, rambling drivel that does not deserve any of the applause which people have so eagerly and richly supplied it with. The attempted irony in the book is distorted and monstrously misapplied. I groaned at each new meaningless illustration or transparent and overwrought attempt at novel, unorthodox narration. The whole book is directed at the lowest common denominator. Style over substance. I admire Vonnegut, and have enjoyed his other works, but Breakfast of Champions belongs in the same trash bin with A Prayer for Owen Meany (John Irving's only garbage novel, yet it is tremendously loved)."
4,"Enjoyable, albeit cynical","These books are cynical college-kid favorites. Its fun to read this book and go ""yeah, society is stupid just like he says"" but its a very narrow point of view. The book takes little bits of truth and distributes them as if they were the only information tid-bits available.Despite this the book is funny and entertaining to read. It makes numerous good, funny points and but carries with it a sick sense of despair at all humans that leaves a bad taste in your mouth about everything, including the novel itself."
3,Not his best,"A friend of mine said this was his favorite by Vonnegut so I read his copy. Personally, I was very disappointed. I read this one after Galapagos and thought Galapagos was far more engrossing."
4,"Love the story, but the Kindle version's editing was HORRIBLE","I loved this story. I won't go into much detail, because there are so many other reviews.The only reason I gave it four stars (instead of five) was because of the low quality of the Kindle eBook.The proofreading was HORRIBLE. Words were missing; punctuation was missing; words wereruntogether (get it?); some word swere split and joined to the next word (get it?).I really love reading the eBooks on the Kindle, but this is a good example of a book where the quality control was severely lacking."
4,What can I say? It's Vonnegut.,"Not Vonnegut's best, but not his worst. Not that it really matters, because his worst is still worth buying and reading. A little too fantastic and meandering for my taste, but the satire never misses."
4,We Need to be Reminded,"Vonnegut was tired and crankier than ever by the time he wrote ""Breakfast of Champions"" but so are we. We are reminded when reading ""Breakfast"" that some perceptive souls like Vonnegut understood and decried long ago the America of economic and environtmental degradation. He was ahead of the curve. As I reread him I recognize not only the world Iived in but the world I still live in, none the better for the intervening years. His outrageous characters, including the author who appears in the story, make us laugh and wince. This is the thinking man's uncomfotable laugh at the world we have made."
4,A good book,"This book is not a sequel to Slaughter House five. It is it's own book. It is a well written book with crude pictures, and crude characters (one character who happens to be in S.H.5.). This book does what a good book is supposed to do."
3,Not the Vonnegut I was looking for,"After reading Galapagos and Cat's Cradle, Breakfast of Champions poorly portray's the brilliance of Kurt Vonnegut. The story drags and seems inadequate.It does pick up at the end though, where it somewhat redeems itself. Vonnegut's typical skewed view of the world narrates you through the story of two strangers who have alot more to do with each other than they know of. Vonnegut shares with the readers his view on life."
1,Don't bother...,"This book was highly recommended by a coworker. As a result, I subsequently really question this person's credibility. This is one of the most pointless, self-indulgent, absolutely unnecessary books I've ever read. Before buying, read the prologue - Vonnegut didn't even want to write this book! Take Vonnegut's own advice and don't bother reading this senseless prose. It was written ""to clear (his) head of all the mental junk that had piled up in 50 years of living on planet Earth"" at the time of writing. Rated 1 star because I couldn't rate it zero..."
2,Breakfast of stupidity,"Save your money. Other books I have read by Kurt Vannegutt had some redeaming qualities; this on has none, in my view."
4,Incredible,"This most recent album from the S9 boys has allowed me to confirm what I've already known for years.....Stroke 9 never disappoints! These new cuts are quite good, but they lack the pure greatness of the Little Black Backpack album. All in all, I say go for it."
4,Works ok,These discs work just fine on my PC and DVD player. Sometimes I have to erase/format new discs before I can write to them but that's not a big hassle. Rewrites aren't a problem.
1,Bad Bad Bad,"I got a 25 pack of these and only 3 barely worked, the rest just won't read in both my deck and DVD drive and of course can't burned the second time. Bad Bad Bad!!!!"
2,ok for the price,I got this and for the first week it looked really good then I washed it and tried to put it back on and the elastic broke. Not sure if it was my error in how I washed it or not.
3,Holistic Health & Fasting,"This book probably spends more time discussing holistic health practices than fasting. There are 5 chapters on ""Greater Spritual Awareness."" The author is a ""holistic"" health writer. While there are many fasting facts in the book, wading through all the new-age and religious jargon to find them is challenging. I am disappointed and am searching for a book with more meat in it and less ""spiritualism."""
4,Very Informative,"This book is very detailed in the descriptions of the dance steps. It would benefit from having sketches or illustrations, but, as a dancer myself, I was able to follow the text just fine."
3,"Pretty good, given its size.","Well-organized list of phrases in twelve languages. It would be ideal for a trip through several different countries in eastern and central Europe, but if you were going to spend any serious time in a single country, you would want more. It has the drawbacks common to all phrasebooks -- the phrases may not be the ones you actually need. Because this one is so compact, there is no room for glossaries or any advice on customs or grammar.Still, it has a lot of phrases in a compact, easy-to-use package.I bought this for a short trip to Romania, where I socialized largely with Hungarian speakers. Didn't need it urgently, and so rarely tested it ""under fire"" -- doctor, train connections, etc. But it helped me learn a few basic phrases in two different languages at the same time, which allowed me to at least seem polite. (Of course, I kept using Romanian phrases among Hungarians and vice-versa, which defeated the purpose a little, but that's not the book's fault!)"
3,Good reads,I know they were to be quick reads but they could have been a little more in depth. But still really good reads.
3,Its ok,I thought it was about one love story but really it was 3 and they are all pretty good but all the same ending.
4,Fun read,This was a very fun read for a busy person who likes to get the whole story in 2 hours or so. Fun bunch of short stories with satisfying characters.
5,Bad Boys In Black Tie,"Lori Foster just has a way with words and her ""Bad Boys"" will send tingles up your naughty side. Anything by this Author is a great read."
3,Not great...,"I'll start by confessing that I AM NOT a Lori Foster fan, and I always think hers are the weakest stories in the Bad Boys anthologies. This book was no different. The sad thing about Foster is that her short stories are actually better than her full novels. I also thought Morgan Leigh's ""Last Call"" was incredibly stupid, with an awful plot and boring characters. Erin McCarthy was the best of the lot. No, it was not great literature, but at least her characters were compelling. Bottom line: I'm glad I checked this one out at the library."
3,A great read for the beach,"This is a great book to take to the beach, Lori Foster never writes a bad book. And I found 2 new to me authors that I will be buying from now on."
5,Enlightening,"This is easily one of the most insightful and profound books I have read in my life. Both the conservative Christian and the man of pure science will despise this book. But if you have an open mind, prepare to have it blown against the wall. Lawrence understands human spiritually like a prophet and conveys his insights in blasts of crystal clarity. This is my first experience with him and I can guarantee he will be a lifelong favorite."
4,Exceptional - and written by an exceptionally talented native english speaker,"You can get this kind of thought if you really spend time with Nietzsche or Deleuze, but very rarely is it possible to find deep thought written by a master of the English language. There is nuance here - and Lawrence would be the first to advise care - but if you can't learn from this book then you are missing out."
5,Best of the Series,"Though I have to admit that I prefered Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan, I'll have to give THFRO the nod for the best in the series. The show's brilliant. Brilliant script that is well executed by wonderful acting. Sean Connery's the man. Can't imagine anyone else playing Ramius. Baldwin did a wonderful job playing Ryan. His best role till date. Would have been greeat to have seen him develop the character in the sequels. And furthermore, James Earl Jones aka the voice of Darth Vader makes his presence in all 3 movies felt though his air time's brief. His presence was greatly missed in The Sum of All Fears.If the studios are planning another Jack Ryan movie..... please get rid of Affleckand bring back Baldwin."
5,"Videoquality could be a little better, but still very good!","Great storyline, superb sound, good video. A must if you like movies of this genre."
5,outstanding feature film,"Sean Connery, Alex Baldwin & Sam Neil made this movie a MUST SEE! From the opening credits, this movie will keep the viewers on the edge of their seats. The underwater scenes were great & the plot was very well done. If you enjoy Connery & a great action movie rent or buy this DVD. Kenny"
5,Best cold war movie,Close between this and by dawn's early light{HBO}for the title of best cold war movie.
1,anyone else have an error?,"Two copies of this disc, both from amazon.com, have an error in exactly the same location. The error, a 2-3 second pause, occurs right after the reactor ""explosion"" when Sam Neil's character manhandles another character for mumuring that ""ramius will get us all killed"". i must agree with the other postings - the quality of this disc is awful. shame on paramount for releasing it. its one of the finest action movies ever made; a great story told very well with awesome visuals. but the low quality of the transfer takes away from all of that."
1,Horrible Picture Quality,"The Hunt for Red October (Special Collector's Edition)Paramount should be ashamed of themselves. The picture quality is atrocious. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE IN DVD FORMAT! Hopefully they haven't screwed up the Blue Ray edition.Unfortunately, I gave my old Laser disk player and movies away months ago. I have been replacing my favorites with DVDs and Red October was my latest purchase. I will probably throw it in the trash.I am, Peter Harrison..... A disgruntled customer and pissed at Paramount for allowing this to happen."
1,A great movie ruined by the conversion to DVD.,"The Hunt for Red October is a great movie that was made nearly worthless when it got converted to DVD. The nearly every scene has obvious dust specks as if you were watching it at a cut-rate theater 6 months after it came out. The compression scheme leaves other scenes so pixelated it looks like you're watching the movie over the internet. Also, ""Hunt"" does not take advantage of some of the greatest features of DVD as it is broken into only 13 ""chapters"" and the sound is nothing to write home about. Save your money and record it off of HBO."
1,Movie (AWESOME) Conversion (POOR)!!,Paramount's role on the transfer of format on this movie is absolutely disgraceful. It will be a long time before I purchase any additional title from this Co. (I'll rent it first)
2,Hunt for Red October,"This movie is one of my favorites,( I watch it several times a year) but on the DVD that I received the sound was not good on the first half of the DVD."
2,"Excellent movie, Horrid DVD","I won't bother reviewing the movie, as there are plenty of reviews here that emphasize the movie itself. What I want to make clear here is that the quality of the DVD transfer and sound is totally unacceptable. The transfer is grainy, unsaturated, has horrible black levels, and perhaps worst of all, has insane compression artifacts. Top that off with the fatc that it's NON anamorphic, and you're in for a miserable experience.The studio is about to release a second edition, which I was looking forward to until I saw the stats - it's also non anamorphic, which means it's probably the same, rotten transfer. Until they remaster this movie, stay clear..."
3,"Excellent movie, poor transfer to DVD","I love the movie and it's in my top-ten list. The quality of the cast is unbelievable and it has an amazing sense of rythm. However, after using the VHS version quite a few times, I have to say that the DVD image quality (especially color) is worse than the tape. Muddy images, horrible flesh tones . I was not too excited about the audio either. Don't waste the money on the DVD, buy the VHS."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"I won't bother reviewing the movie, as there are plenty of reviews here that emphasize the movie itself. What I want to make clear here is that the quality of the DVD transfer and sound is totally unacceptable. The transfer is grainy, unsaturated, has horrible black levels, and perhaps worst of all, has insane compression artifacts. Top that off with the fatc that it's NON anamorphic, and you're in for a miserable experience."
3,Interesting,"I am always a sucker for submarine movies. This one, on board modern super-submarines, is interesting though in parts not very credible. Good entertainment."
4,Silent And Deadly,"Don't be misled by the name of the review, it has to do with the submarines in the movie. The Soviets have developed a new sub that runs virtually silent. Sean Connery is the captain of the sub, and has been deemed insane and dangerous, and may fire nukes on the US. Alec Baldwin plays Dr. Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst, who's called in to help the Americans. He thinks that Connery is planning to defect and the Soviets made up the story of him being insane to prevent his sub from ending up in our hands.This is a great naval thriller, but it takes a higher level of intelligence to completely appreciate this film. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time."
4,Best of the three,"I loved this film and would recomend it to anyone. I have read a few of Tom Clancy's books and it is one of his best stories behind ""without remorse"". Alec Baldwin is perfect in the part and in my oppinion should have played Jack Ryan in the other two films, but that is not to say that Ford was terrible in the role. The good acting throughout the film by all the cast makes it a very absorbing film to watch and not at all tedious.It does, however, seem a shame to depart from the book in a few places just to make it more ""America wins the day"" kind of a film. If you read the book, like i have you will realise that the British Navy plays a small part in the story and, indeed, Ryan flies out to HMS Invincible first before his mad dash to catch USS Dallas!. But i am nit picking and i love this film even though, you have to say, it is not a classic in the Shawshank Redemption league, but there aren't any other films to live up to that one either."
5,Classic submarine adventure movie,They did a great job turning the book into a great movie. A must-see if you like submarine action.
4,"Good story, so-so effects and commentary","I've never read a Tom Clancy book, so I can not say if the movie was faithful to it.What was put on the screen was a good story, with good actors. I've never been a fan of Sean Connery, but he was OK here. It was the strength of Alec Baldwin and the supporting actors that keep this movie going.The movie was made in the period just before the heavy CGI effects started becoming routine, so don't expect to be overwhelmed by them. I'm not a big fan of movies that rely on special effects to carry them along, anyway, so I do not take points off for this.The short ""Below the Surface"" feature was pretty good, but the director's commentary seemed a bit sluggish.Probably a bit generous with 4 stars..."
4,"Technical problems aside, owning it is a must...",The Hunt for Red October features superb acting on the part of Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin. The scenes are well thought out and the action sequences believable. I agree with other viewers that the DVD quality is not that of other films. My original copy was defective but the second works fine. (NOTE to PC DVD users... you may need to request newer drivers to view Paramount DVDs)
3,The movie is great - the video quality is poor,"While this movie is a very thrilling and well done piece, the transfer quality to DVD is awful. I thought I was watching it on tape or that the DVD was defective. Audio is fantastic. I hope it is re-released with better video."
3,"Excellent film, poor DVD","THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER is a submarine thriller masterpiece.It has a great plot, and cast. Sean Connery is excellent as Captain Marco Ramius, his character is complex but great. This film is not only a submarine thriller, but it is highly political. This balance makes the film a classic.However, the DVD version is not very good. It has poor picture and sound quality. It's lack of features is revolting. If not for my extreme fondness of this film, I would not own this DVD. If you really like this film, buy the DVD. If not, then you have two options. First option: don't buy it all. Second option: buy the VHS tape. The choice is yours. Join the hunt today."
2,"Really, I didn't like this.","I was always certain that this movie was an action film, but really there is hardly any action in it. Despite an excellent cast, including some small roles for quite well-known actors, this film just didn't seem to work. I haven't watched it enough timesa to remember what it's about, because it's just too boring. Maybe, there are one or two small tense moments in the film, but not many. I thought the jump from the helicopter to the sumbmarine scene waas good and the last ten minutes were quite good, but I feel the action gets rushed.But, if you like submarine movies you will like this. And, if you like Connery you will like this, but the film just doesn't work for me."
1,terrible movie,this movie is stupid. did the producers ever go on a submarine? they didn't even wear the correct uniform.6 year vet of the submairne force
5,Very suspenseful,"The movie takes you on a glorious trip the first time you see it. Sean Connery shows that you just get better with age. He's at the top of his form here. Beter than he was as James Bond or Indiana Jones' father. But here's what you do. See the movie again a year or so later. I guarantee, it will be just as suspenseful. Most movies that claim to be suspense, once you see it, it loses that element of surprise. When I first saw it, it was around the time when the Soviet Union was in existence and they seemed to be like a dog you pass by that growls but you're not sure if it'll jump up and bite you. In subsequent times, I noticed the drama being about how credible Jack Ryan was as a expert. Most of the time Alex Baldwin annoys me in his roles (watch him in the edge) but here, he carries off the rookie begging to be believed (a character played almost as well by John Cusack in Con Air). I loved the music. Also good to see blacks working with technical equipment."
1,DVD not receive,We have never receive the DVD or a comment from the buy. We would love to receive the DVD we purchased. It there any information you can provide regarding this?
4,Action-packed movie,"Great dialogue, fairly true to the novel, and fast-paced action. Good late afternoon watching, especially when you keep missing parts from the airings of the movie on TV!"
4,decent but not great,"Not too much to say. I love the movie, but the video wasn't great, as there seems to be some amount of graininess in the dark areas of the picture. Still, in the brighter scenes, it's about what you want from HD. Of course, the HD really brings out the rear projection in the final scene."
2,Horrible Video Quality,"I love the Hunt for Red October and the makers of the DVD did it a horrible injustice. The video quality is horrible. I tend to buy DVDs for the enhanced video quality, but save your money on this one. Just buy the VHS version and save your money because it is not worth it."
2,"Great movie, lousy Blu-Ray transfer","This is a quick review of the Blu-Ray release of ""The Hunt for Red October"".The picture quality is lousy. It ranges from near-pristine to uber-grainy and changes with each camera angle making this version hard to watch.When a Hollywood studio invests in a Blu-Ray transfer of an older film, why can't they take the time to do it right? Grrrr..."
3,Great movie - poor transfer,"I love this movie - it's fast-paced, well-acted, and the screenplay may be better than the book. Unfortunately, the transfer to DVD is so mediocre and grainy (especially when viewed on an HDTV) that it is barely better than my laserdisc copy. Still, if you're a cold war techno-thriller fan, buy it!"
5,Very pleased!,Got the DVD very fast. Haven't played it yet but I am very pleased with this transaction.
4,BAND ON THE RUN,"Movie was released just as the Soviet Empire was disintegrating. It seems that Connery has served too long in the Russian Navy and has designs of defecting with crew and submarine to the USA. He's convinced that a new, soundless submarine will lead to yet another arms race, at minimum. The problem is that the entire Russian northern fleet is after him and the Americans aren't sure whether the Russians are using a ploy to attack USA interests. Enter Jack Ryan to correctly interpret Connery's every move in a typical underwater chess match. Only a loyal Russian saboteur causes havoc before he's overcome, thus adding weight to the drama. A good, not great movie with action, suspense and the aging Connery making for a good buy at a reasonable price, especially when boxed with other related specials."
5,great christmas present,"My husband and I got this for his dad as a christmas present. It's a great movie that has a plot intriguing enough to capture my father-in-law's attention (which is no small feat). It's wide-screen, though, which not everyone prefers."
4,A must have movie,"Been meaning to buy this DVD for quite some time. My old VHS bit the dust, so it was time."
5,A must have for any Submarine enthusiast!,"As a former submariner I do recommend this great movie!I did notice a few ""errors"" (more on the technical side) through some of the scenes of the movie, but I always expect that... after all submarines are supposed to be a bit secretive, aren't they?The plot is very interesting and I do compare it with some historical events - close calls in the 70's and 80's with some Russian subs close to the continental US... who knows? Maybe Clancy got his idea from those events!If you like naval history, submarines, and good action flicks, you're in for a treat with this one."
5,Hunt for Red October completed,"I had seen ""The Hunt for Red October"" several times before. Watched it again upon receipt of DVD, purchased through Amazon. Found there were intricacies I had previously missed. Very good movie."
4,Great movie,"This is a very good Sean Connery movie. The story, cast, film-making are wonderful. The only little disapointment would be the image quality: not as good as I thought what it should be as a blu-ray version. However, it is still a very good movie that you cannot miss."
2,Hunt for Red October,"Although it says that this blue ray is region free, it does not play at all on both my Sony Playstation-3 and my Sony Region 2 Blue Ray Player, Model #BDP-S1E."
3,"Too much Connery, not enough Curry","I've never been a big Connery or Baldwin fan, but when I heard that Tim Curry had a small role in this I was convinced that it was at least good enough to rent.The movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't exactly good either. The only thing that saves it is Curry's small but good performance. Otherwise, it's not worth watching. Had it not been for him I would've rated it a measly 1 star.If you're a Connery or Baldwin fan you're gaurenteed to love this film. But if you're like me and you'd prefer Tim any day, still rent it. You won't regret it, but you won't be begging for more either."
2,"Super movie, junk DVD","This movie is one of my all time favorites for kewl action and awesome sound for a theater system. Loved it on VHS. But the DVD is pure TRASH! It is the worst DVD I have bought yet and am returning it. Pictures are very fuzzy and unclear, even compared with movies of similar vintage. Paramount ripped us off by just slapping this thing on DVD with no focus on quality. DON'T BOTHER WITH DVD. Stick with the VHS version."
4,"Fantastic Movie, Junk DVD-quality","As some people stated before: The movie is great, very thrilling, with excellent actors. But the DVD-version is REALLY disappointing. The worst one I have seen. Compared with the german version of the 5th Element, this DVD is junk!"
5,great transfer of older film,"a lot of blu-ray disc's i've gotten lately of older movies haven't quite been spectacular as far as master quality. However, this movie is crisp and clean looking. It doesn't say that it was remastered anywhere that I can find but it sure looks good though. Good buy."
3,"fun movie, lousy transfer to DVD","Red October is unquestionably the most entertaining of the Tom Clancy movies. Connery in particular does a nice job as the Russian sub captain and the rest of the cast is good as well. Great editing keeps the story moving without getting bogged down in unnecessary character development (let's face it, Tom Clancy characters don't generally need a lot of development). The underwater sub battle at the end is remarkably well shot--it is made clear to the viewer exactly what is happening with all three subs that are invoked.My complaint is with the picture quality of this DVD. This is a fairly recent movie, and a popular one, so there is absolutely no excuse for the grainy picture quality through much of the movie as well as noticeable white specks in many scenes, particularly the dimly lit sub-interior scenes. Home theater buffs are going to be disappointed at a transfer that really isn't too much better than VHS."
5,The Hunt for Red October,"As a ten year veteran of the US Navy Submarine Service, I was literally glued to my seat when I saw this movie for the first time. In fact, during some of the undersea scenes twoard the end, I could feel myself swaying back and forth in the seat, just as I did when I took my turn while the sub was on high speed manuevers in the early 70's. Any time this movie is on TV, I usually try to watch but my wife finally bought me my own copy.The book was far more detailed and a little hookey in places but both the book and the movie did justice to the sub force. Here is to us, and those like us ... damn few! Qualified in Submarines."
1,Not for me...,"For an action movie, this movie was slow going and failed to keep our attention spans engaged. We enjoy these types of movies; however, after watching he Bourne series it was a real let down though it can highly recommended."
3,listen up,Stop complaining about the 2-3second pause...it's normal because the dvd has to switch layers becuase of the lenth of the movie. If they didnt use rsdl then you would have to flip the disc....
3,Great Movie / Lousy DVD,"This DVD looks like it was transferred from a print that had been projected 200 times. From the end to end white ""lint & dust specks"" to the abrupt missing two seconds at the end of a chapter this is a major disappoitment for anyone who loves this movie and has eagerly awaited it's release on DVD. Pass it up until Paramount re-issues a remastered version."
5,Baldwin= Jack Ryan,I've read all of Tom Clancy's books and Alec Baldwin is the best actor to portray Jack Ryan. I could watch this film over and over.
3,Warning - requires 5.1 sound system!,"The picture looks great, but the Blu-ray disk will not play the dialogue center channel on a TV with built-in stereo only speakers. This disk ""requires a full 5.1 sound system"", no other options. I'm sticking with standard DVD for now."
3,The Best Submarine movie ever ...so far2002.,"Sean Connery leads and all star cast with a purpose. They all hold up their end of it too.! Truely, like lightening striking.I cannot recommend this enough.Based on a book by Tom Clancy (same name book) who has lectured at CIA and been a walk away winner on celebrate 'Jepoardy'against the Fmr. White House Press secretary, and a another brainiac."
3,submarine war,"""The Hunt for Red October""Good enough. The imperialist capitalists won.I read this book in 1990. There is a new submarine developed by the Soviets. It is to be taken out on its maiden voyage. It is very quiet, so quiet that it is near impossible to detect with sonar. This makes it special to the United States Navy as well. The problem is that the Captain and other officers are tired of being under the oppression of the Soviets. With this sub they hope to make a good break for the United States.The Navy catches wind of this new sub and wants to find it. The Soviets have caught wind of the desire to defect by the officers, so they want to find it as well. Simple story, pretty well written."
3,SUBMERGED,"This is the first Tom Clancy/Jack Ryan novel adapted to the screen, and while it's production values are high and its cast capable, I found HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER to be too long on talk, too short on action, and too long overall. Sometimes movies that take places on subs can become claustrophobic and tedious, and I found that to be the case in this film. While Sean Connery is marvelous as the Russian captain, and Alec Baldwin makes an effective Ryan, the movie's pacing is too slow and the action sequences are stiff and uninvolving. It also takes the entire movie to find the motivation for Connery's actions. But the movie boasts a fine supporting cast: Courtney B. Vance, Scott Glenn, Peter Firth, Sam Elliott, Joss Ackland, Richard Jordan, and Stellan Starsgaard are all fine. A crisper, sharper editing might have made it a classic, but as it stands, it's merely a competent drama."
5,Hunt for Red October,"What a fantastic action movie. The HD transfer is quite good, giving extra definition to the interiors of the submarines. About the only thing that dates the movie is the old cars used at the start of the movie. The bonus feature was a great watch also. Definitely worth the update from DVD to BluRay!"
3,Excellent film. Horrible transfer.,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is also THE WORST QUALITY VHS CASSETTE I HAVE EVER SEEN. The picture is grainy with dust flecks everywhere, colors are weak, and the dialog is terribly muddy. I considered returning this VHS cassette and exchanging it for the DVD. After reading reviews of the DVD, I realized that these are not just VHS problems. Paramount cut corners mastering this film and it shows. Frankly, this movie looked better on HBO. I hate to encourage copyright infringement but Paramount deserves it for shelling out this garbage. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Go get a good blank tape and record it off HBO. Your copy will probably look and sound better than the crap Paramount put on the shelves."
4,Hunt &#1053;&#1072; &#1050;&#1088;&#1072;&#1089;&#1085;&#1099;&#1081; &#1054;&#1082;&#1090;&#1103;&#1073;&#1088;&#1100;,"The hunt for red october is a really great sub combat movie. Though filmed in the late 80's it's still just as good today as it was then. A Russian sub commander decided to steal a sub and defect to the US, though no one in the US thinks it's that simple. Great movie, lots of action, great actors."
2,Good starter map,"I bought this map on Amazon and it was a good basic starter map for our 10 day trip to Kauai. Ironically, it was the only map we saw available when we first arrived and in many cases what I paid on Amazon was much cheaper then the price for the same thing on Kauai itself! However, if you really want to travel around Kauai and are going to be looking for specific streets, you need something much more detailed then this map has to offer."
2,Not the greatest,"With apologies to the author -- I've been to Kauai many times, and this is the one map I would not have taken into my car. It's accurate, but it's so small, it's not useful. Maybe I'm not good at translating map scales as printed in the product description, but I was sadly disappointed. I got around better using the ""free"" maps.What I would suggest....rerelease this map as a laminated card. It's the right size for that. It wouldn't be a bad move with all of the rain they get."
2,Good if interested in Tolkien's literary philosophy.,"Tolkien (The book but apparently also the man himself) is slow-developing but interesting. If you're a fan of Hobbits and looking for more background information (in light of the new movie?) then I would encourage you to pick this book up used. If you're not pursuing an understanding of Tolkien's literary philosophy on character names or insights into the lifestyle of an author/professor, I would encourage you to pass on this one. 2 out of 5 harry hobbit feet.AMY"
4,A semi-classic,"It's always nice to see an old classic back in print. Originally planned as a continuation of Charles Patton Dimitry?s _Louisiana Families_ series (published in 1892), the authors augmented that work by extending the coverage to English, Scots, and Irish family lines, as well as adding French and Spanish families omitted by Dimitry. There's a great deal of compiled material here, but no source citations. It would also have been useful to include an every-name index in place of the original index which lists only ""stem"" surnames. Likewise, the prose can be a bit florid for modern tastes, but Louisiana researchers will want to begin much of their research on new families with this volume."
4,"The voivod is back, and as aggresive as ever","Voivod has long been fighting the battle against mainstream metal, with their almost out-of-tune guitar sound and totally far-out concepts. Thanks to the creative force behind the chaos (Away), Voivod still exists today and has returned with an aggressive edge not seen since Dimension Hatross. If you used to be a fan before their turn to spacial-psycho-rock, then grab Phobos (and Negatron), for their thrashy core is back with vengeance. We return to the story of the Voivod, the cybernetic vampire, as he is resurrected and brought back to life by his master, and returns to Earth. The lyrics aren't as wacky and ""out there"" as when Snake was writing them, but they fit with Eric Forrest's growling and shouting vocals. I have always loved the sound of Piggy's guitar, it's so different and unique. Voivod has, and always will be, hard to classify, but that's what makes them stand out and so excellent."
2,"Another ""Exodus"" album","This album is another poor effort from Piggy and Away. The mix on this album is the same as on 'Negatron'. Eric Forrest's vocals and bass playing is ""death metal-esque"". He is a fan of death metal and has brought in the death metal scene into Voivod. Death Metal does not fit in with the Voivod profile and should not sound this way. This album is too different from the previous albums with Snake and Blacky. Eric Forrest is a joke! He's like the Kurt Cobain of death metal and became a ""control freak"" in the band. This album is Voivod's second worst effort. True Voivodians would be diapointed."
1,Good for 2 days...,"As soon as i got this laser I thoght this was going to be the best laser ever, it worked really good for the first 2 days but after that the laser lost the ""power"" so at the end I got a really bad product, I will recomend you to stay away from this if you want a laser pointer that last more than 48 hours. Really bad quality!!!"
3,OK for a basic pointer,"I bought this to use with Cubscouts at campouts, etc. - and many hours later it still works perfectly fine. It is certainly not the most powerful astronomical pointer out there, but it does fit the bill. Note that if you have a lot of light pollution around, you won't see much - seems obvious, I would think. I think it is a good value for the $$$There are many other reviews of this product out on the web, I suggest you search them out before making your final descision."
1,Customer support is nill,"I agree with the others who posted after they encountered a problem with the product. This product is fabulous when it works, but if if goes dead on you, you are own your own. It worked great for a few months before it died. I tried to negotiate customer support with a very poor telephone connection to India, speaking with a person who understood little English. The U.S. tech support office could offer no help when I tried calling them later.Since these routers are all the same, buy from a company with good tech support."
5,"Best 8-port, unmanaged GigE switch I could find","Very few gigabit switches support jumbo frames. Very few people care. If you do care, you'll be pleased to know that this switch supports up to 9 KB MTU. However, all machines connected to this switch (directly, or via other layer 2 switches) must be configured to use the same MTU. So, most people won't & shouldn't bother with it.Other points in favor of this switch include: seems well-constructed (metal chassis), includes rackmount brackets, is fanless, and seems to run relatively cool (though I'm not taxing it, by any means).I'm pleased - so far it's everything I hoped! As my title suggests, I looked at reviews & datasheets of nearly a dozen 8-port GigE switches, before selecting this one. This is a great deal!!"
2,Pregnant Teens?,When the show first came out it was so bad. It pretty much served as a really long public service announcement. Now the show has gotten ridiculous!! This person is having sex with this person. The younger sister is trying to hook up with the father of her nephew. The boy who was supposedly so in love with Amy got another girl pregnant!! I mean come on. So now the show is pretty much saying that getting pregnant at 16 isn't so bad. Granted not the worst thing that could happen but 16 is too young to become a parent in my opinion. The show needs to make its point and be done with it.
4,emergency phone,I bought this phone for emergencies when the electricity is off and all my wireless phones will not function. This is a direct to phone line hook-up and thjerefore not dependent on electric power. It works well. Every house should have at least one phone that is not dependent on the electric company for operation.
2,Cheap made phone.,It works and plays well but not made great. Some buttons you have to press twice to make it work. Call Id works fine.
3,Caller ID not working,"I ordered two of these. There are other phones in the house that have caller ID working, but neither of these do. I called the support number and was told to try to remove all the other phones to see if they interfere. If that is the case am I supposed to not have the other phones? I have FIOS internet and I can see that the phone lines come through that equipment. Perhaps these phones have a compatibility issue that the others do not."
3,AT&T Trimline 260,The purchase was to replace my old 260 that is no longer manufactured or available in a bricks & mortar store. The sound quality is not as good as my old 260...and...when I speak I hear a vibrating noise that makes me believe the other party is not receiving clear sound.
2,"Good phone, one MAJOR flaw","This is a good phone, except it has one major flaw which makes it unusable. First off, a minor flaw is that it is hard to pick up the reciever as it is locked in there, I don't like that. Another flaw is that while you are picking up and putting back the phone, it makes a VERY high and LOUD screaming pitch. This makes it almost deafening for someone on another phone in the house. This phone will be going back ASAP because it is unusable. Stay away from this phone at all costs."
5,A Useful Resource for Welsh Beginners,"Cymraeg, the language of the Welsh people, is an ancient language which usually takes a lot of effort to learn. This book tries to simplify that task. It also makes it fun to learn Welsh. This is an excellent book for Welsh beginners, experts and what the Welsh call ""il - dysgwyr""- literally ""econd learners.""Buy the cassette version from Amazon and hear Welsh as it is spoken!"
4,Good if you use it!,Welsh can be a difficult language to learn. This has CDs that help a lot! I would recommend taking them along on a long road trip.
1,"a bit ""crazy"" sounding","do not get this if you don't like that crazy, not so orderly sound. the music is just going all over the place. Not such a pleasant sound."
1,Shallow and boring!,"I ordered 5 books including this one, and all of them are so very shallow, low level and boring.Some of the chapters were actually copied in several books! Unbelivable.I would probably recommend this series to school children interested in management - nothing more than that."
2,Very disappointing.,"I regularly read great articles from the subscription program of HBR and rely on its contents for great insight into today's business environment.Unfortunately, the HBR book series make a poor comparison. I have even wonder if HBR is recycling unused, or rejected submissions for these books.I bought Managing People, Brand managment and Marketing and stopped reading each after just two articles. They were just all a waste of time."
2,A pseudo-deep study of two sick individuals,"A pseudo-deep study/ soap opera of two rather repulsive,sick individuals. . .The problem with the movie is that the two main characters, as rendered, areimmature self-dramatizing individuals that are forever drinking, smoking, talkingdirty, and talking about themselves. When did either of them have time to write?"
5,Much much better than the reviews,"I have many books about EH, sorry faster tto tytpe. I could make many critical statements but overall this is a plus and I am glad I have it. Not everything has to be perfect and there are many many gripping moments."
2,KIDMAN BADLY MISCAST,"KIDMAN'S PORTRAYAL OF GELLHORN MISSES THE MARK. GELLHORN WAS A GRITTY, VERY TALENTED AND INDEPENDENT WOMAN WHO DID NOT NEED HEMMINGWAY'S TUTORING. BOTH HEMMINGWAY AND GELLHORN WERE PORTRAYED AS CARICATURES OF THE REAL PEOPLE. HEMMINGWAY WAS MUCH MORE THAN A CAROUSING DRUNK MOST OF THE TIME, AND GELLHORN WAS NOT THE SEXY, KITTENISH PERSON THAT KIDMAN SERVES UP. HAD EXPECTED MUCH MORE DEPTH THAN THE FILM DELIVERS."
2,"Some ""serious"" scenes are so dumb, that I laughed","Just watched HBO's Hemingway and Gellhorn...rather watched about half of it before deleting it.A pretty bad movie. So bad, it reminded me of the movie ""Pearl Harbor"" from ten years (or so) ago, in that the viewer can tell there was a great deal of money spent to create the special effects and pay the salaries of the big-time stars in it. However, the script, directing, and overacting ruins this film. I believe that some of the stars in it are undoubtedly embarrassed they agreed to do it.How to describe it? Scenes so awful they were funny, chock full of dumb lines, and overacting. The writing and directing? Nevermind."
1,Exceedingly Bad,"Hammy acting, hammy dialogue, cheesy music cues; it's a terrible movie. I'm a fan of Hemingway's writing and even I couldn't force myself to sit through this. No wonder HBO premiered it on a Monday night."
1,Save your money!,Bought several of these to line my driveway on Halloween night. The donut shaped bases are supposed to hold water or sand to weigh them down. One base did not have and internal wall so you could'nt put anything in it. Other's leaked water all over the place. They kept falling over and breaking. The weight of the chain itself was enough to cause them to sag to one side. Absolute junk.
3,"Looks cool, but crappys construction","These are really cheapy. The parts have to be screwed together, but the screw parts snapped off. I had to rig it up with a dowel inside to make them stand up. But they do look awesome, and I am glad I have them."
2,lightens but highlights fine lines,"I love Larenim products: have used their eyeshadow, blush, etc and always been very pleased. I thought I'd try the under eye concealer . . . it brightens and lightens but also makes fine lines show up more than they would otherwise. Will continue searching."
4,My brand,This is the brand of foundation I use and I was able to purchase it for half price! So I am happy.
5,Solid and indespinsable,"""Constructive Anatomy"" is unique in that George presents the viewer a 'real world' application of the muscles, by telling you what each muscle does.I'd be wrong in saying this book is a one-stop source for learning to draw people. Let's face it anatomy is tough and artists can use all the help they can get! What this book offers that other's don't is different views and applications of perceiving the limbs, muscles, bones, joints, etc., of the body. For the price it's listed out, ya can't go wrong!"
4,Anatomy book for the growing pro,Its a great beginner drawing book for the aspiring artist that need to work on the human figure and constructive movement
4,Amazing,"This book has already helped me figure out how the body works when drawing, and I have a better understanding of the human anatomy"
1,"product is a ""facsimile""..not complete..they didn't tell me","I was dissappointed in this product..it is not a copy of the original book..just a facsimile with less information..very incomplete..company didn't tell me..it was not worth the $20.00 it cost (including shipping). Also company never sent me notification that they received my order, none that they shipped..and never responded to my e-mails...a negative experience!"
2,Not what I hoped for!,"I expected more from this book based on the reviews that I read before buying it. Although it has some good information about what specific muscles jobs are, the illustrations are not clear enough for good understanding. As an artist specifically working with the human form I find this book very mickey mousey and incomplete. If you already have all the books ever created on human anatomy that are needed to put together the information that is required to have a comprehensive knowledge on how the human body is constructed and moves then get this to finish your collection, but if you are looking for a clear understanding and accurate information on human anatomy for the artist look elswhere."
5,A Personal Note From the Author . . .,"Nobody could have anticipated the recent events ever happening to our country. My heart and prayers go out to everyone involved including those watching from their homes that wish to help. I pray for you daily. I also urge you to help with your prayers and to find Jesus if you haven't already.In light of what has happened to our country recently, I cannot begin to stress the importance of the subject matter contained in my book and books like mine. If you are searching for answers about a God that loves you, cares unconditionally for you and judges you based on your actions while on this earth, then this is one of the books for you. Take an adventurous trip to heaven and feel what it might be like to fly with angels. While you're there, pray for your salvation and those around you. If you are inclined to do so, pick up the Bible. I will glady take a backseat to that book any day.God bless."
2,Malfunctioning Device,"Product is malfunctioning. Didn't have the battery charger; which was not disclosed in the device display. During video is played back, the pictures show grid lines that distort quality of the actual images."
1,Dont waste your money on a JVC product!!!!!,"JVC had a class action lawsuit about their camcorders and even though this one is not on the list, it should be. I bought it new and it has had a problem dropping sound and pixilation on the left side of the screen since I opened the box. It has been into JVC repair FOUR, yes FOUR times since I bought it at the beginning of the summer 2007 and every time it had been returned, the problem persists. JVC has yet to acknowledge that it is a LEMON and insists on repairing it. Their repairs do not work! I dont think they are even doing anything but repacking it and sending it back to me. Its out for repair at JVC as I type this and hopefully they will replace it this time. PLEASE, for your sanity's sake, buy another camcorder besides JVC."
1,"Horrible audio and ""photo"" runs without pressing a button","Not sure if my camcorder is a lemon, but the audio is distorted. Also the photot feature that somes with this camcorder, which allows you to take photos whenever, it is taking photos randomly both while in pause, not recording mode, as well as durning movie recording mode. I will be returning my camcorder immediately and getting something different."
3,"Great, till you need to put more music on it...","I bought this a few years ago and I've loved it every since. BUT, after a while my music started building up, so I decided to get a Micro SDHC card for it. THEY DON'T TELL YOU THIS SO PAY ATTENTION!!! I purchased a 8GB card so I would have plenty of space. IT DOESN'T WORK!! Evedently, this model doesn't except a card over 2GB...so if you have more than 6GB of music, and want to hear it all, get one that has more memory! I mean, don't get me wrong, i love this little Mp3 player. I take it running and on long trips and it works great. The only downfall is the memory. I hope this helps someone!"
4,headlamp,Good headlamp for the price. A little difficult to snap together correctly- but for the price it works well.
3,Could be better,"I was disappointed with the materials in the head lamp. Battery case is poorly made, considering the price. Does project good light when working."
4,Good headlamp for Burning Man,"Bought this headlamp for Burning Man - solid product, worked well. The switch sticks a bit, but its probably just the dust. Nice and bright - good price for the brand."
3,"Good Lamp, Not Great",I like Petzl products and chose this one because it was much less expensive than the others. The sliding on/off switch isn't as nice to use as the rubber push button switches on their other lamps. However it is made well and the light output is good.
2,"Watch out, other Petzyl Tikkas are great, but not this one!","I've depended on Petzyl Tikkas for daily use for years, and didn't even understand how there was variation between them, considering they are named the same. But this one does not have the button for 3 light settings (hi, lo, blink), it just has on/off, which for me is too bright for reading with new batteries. It also is somehow made with inferior machining (or mine are bad luck) because for 1st time this one doesn't provide steady light, but occasionally flickers a bit like the connections are iffy. Which is more irritating than it may seem. Not like a candle, more like a constant reminder to swat your head and see if the thing gets fixed. So, go for the slightly more expensive Tikkas that have the button, not slide switch, and have never in my history of owning 6 flickered."
3,"i'm surprised by the quality, or rather the lack thereof","when shopping for this headlamp, i went for a Petzl because of its reputation and my satisfactory experience owning a Petzl more than 10 years ago.it's small, light, weatherproof and more than bright enough for most tasks whether it's night walking, working around camps, or during a black-out.however, after two years of infrequent usage the band has lost its elasticity - rather too early in my opinion, and the lamp unit doesn't close properly anymore after a few inevitable drops which has broken a chip off a corner. as a result, the headlamp's weatherproofness is compromised and it doesn't hold the batteries very well anymore. for a gear designed for outdoor use, i believe it is not unreasonable to expect the built quality to be better."
4,"Nice product, very handy, not bad price, but switch a bit questionable","This headlamp is a nice one in both design and price. It's light weight, bright (unlike others I've tried), comfortable, and very nicely adjustable. I really like the new addition they have of being able to move the lamp up and down and tilt it in various positions. It's durable and pretty water repellent. My only complaint is, like other reviewers, this one seems to have a bit of a problem with the switch - after a while, it tends to flicker some and that seems tied into the switch. Sometimes just turning it off and back on corrects the flickering but not always. I had their previous model of this headlamp and it didn't ever do that (and I had it for many years/much use). Great product for all outdoor activities and at not too bad a price, but keep an eye out for possible flickering/switch problems."
5,huge improvement over the 2.4ghz it replaced,"First one arrived defective but after 1 email seller had a replacement on its way the very next day. After installing, I booted straight to BIOS and the hyperthreading option was automatically added to my PC's CPU options. System sees it like its a dual core CPU and it flies in my optiplex gx260."
2,Painfully high shutter lag,"Good looking Camera. Good Pictures. But very low shutter speed. Low Memory. Heavy drain on the batteryI tried to take my 2 year old daughter's pictures in action. But becuase of the SLOW SHUTTER speed, I did not get the pose I wanted. Many pictures are dark, 2 out of 5 pictures come out completely dark. Very low memory - just 4 MB. Fits just 6 pictures in the defult resolution. Uses up too much battery power - Need to recharge after approx. 10 pictures. Does not come with rechargable battery or recharger."
5,Great Camera!,"I am surprised to here some people say they have a problem with this camers. If they do it must be they don't understand the concrpt of photography. You point and shoot, thats all. A little patients and your home free. I found it very easy to operate and got great pictures. Many were high defenition shots. This is my first digital camera and I think its great. The only thing I wish it had is a ac adapter. Only because it does use a lot of current. But to download is quick. And while at home it would be nice to use a adapter to save the batteries and not have to worry about using them up while working on a program. I recommend this camera highly!"
2,Dial broke,"I had this camera for about a year when the dial broke. Of course, repairing this is far more costly than a new camera, so here I am. I found the camera did take good quality pictures, but if it isn't going to work after a year, then what's the point?"
1,The dial broke...,"I've had it for a year and half... it has it's good, and bad sides, but 2 days ago, the dial just fell off... upon inspection I've discovered that it was made to brake... which was supported by numerous reports of the same problem... don't buy this camera, or any other from toshiba..."
5,Great Camera - Great Price,"I purchased my camera a few weeks ago and rapidly came to realize what other reviewers before me had. Rechargable batteries and a larger smartmedia card are absolutley necessary, but also well worth the few xtra bucks. I couldn't find a compareable camera for the same price. Very easy to use with some experimenting. I find the picture quality to be very good at the higher settings. Prints are almost indistinguishable from 35mm photos. I love it more every day. Get yours today, don't hesitate."
2,Who needs AC Adapter?,"I bought this camera in 2001 and it's dead now. When I just got it, it sarted giving me problems with batteries(kept showing ""low batteries""), so I bought AC Adapter to avoid this problem(I used it indoor only), and that same problem came back again 2.5 years later, ""low batteries"" with AC Adapter. It made noise, kept blinking until went completely dead. I did take same good photos with this camera, but since it's dead now, I have AC Adapter that's perfectly fine and doesn't go with any other camera. I payed $60, if anyone wants it, I'll sell it for $25. Email me: DukyTheDog@yahoo.com"
