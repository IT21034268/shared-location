4,"Not bad--but those angry lyrics, ugh!","This album feels almost unfinished, but it's still surprisingly good...""Whatchulookinat"" is a pretty darn good song, it's just that the lyrics are so banal. She pours her heart into ""You Light Up My Life,"" and ""Luv That Man"" is an amazing, irresistible dance song. The album is quite enjoyable, the only thing irritating is the angry tone. I mean, come on Whitney, you're a rich, successful, beautiful woman. Who cares what small minded, uneducated people say about you. They're not writing your checks (""I wanna see receipts!"") It's only the small minded who are affected by the small minded. Grow up, girlfriend, and stop smokin' so much."
2,Whitney...,"This album falls to the bottom of my list. There's only one song I find a little interested in and that is ""One Of Those Days"". It's a somewhat catchy song you can listen to while cruising in your car. But it's not a Whitney song. This album is not a Whitney album in my opinion. She needs to sing with more power and more drama. She needs to bring back those old hit songs that made her famous...""Didn't We Almost Have It All""...""Greatest Love Of All""...""I Will Always Love You""...just to name a few. After all is she trying to compete with younger R&B singers in this album? (Ashanti...Aaliyah...ect.)She used to have her own competition with such artists as ""Celine Dion""...or ""Mariah Carey"". I just hope her next album is more Whitney."
3,Could be a lot better!,"For such a big voice you would expect a better album and a bit longer too - only 10 songs! But lets say you still get some quality because her voice is one of the best in the world! Tracks such as ''one of those days '' , ''tell me no'' and ''On my own'' are great! As usually the colaboration of Babyface to make a great song! The best ballad is a cover ''you light up my life''! if you like to listen to a great voice buy this is Whitney!"
2,Just a train wreck.,"What words do you use to describe a train wreck such as this. Although there are a couple of decent songs ('Unashamed', 'One of Those Days', 'Try It On My Own'), most are forgettable re-hashed pop/r&b stuff ('My Love', 'Dear John Letter', 'My Love'). Ms. Houston takes a step back from My Love Is Your Love to the early 90s... no good collaborations here... no Faith Evans, no Missy Elliott. The duet with Bobby Brown doesn't even sound like they were in the same room at the same time. And the worst of all is 'You Light Up My Life', a song that should never have been covered. Certainly this is her weakest effort to date. Bad songs, bad arrangements, bad lyrics... just bad all around."
2,Very Disappointed,"Unfortunately, Whitney's substance abuse has had a disasterous effect on her voice.Her voice sounds strained, hoarse,under-powered and in no way resembles her once powerfully glorious instrument. You can hear better singing at any Baptist Church on any given Sunday!This is a tragedy of epic proportions. The tracks that I listened to almost brought me to tears. It is a cautionary tale of what addiction and self-indulgence can do to the voice...to the soul.However, this is an old story...Billie Holliday, Anita O'Day (among others) come to mind.It reminds me of what a miracle Chaka Khan is(She still has her voice)...maybe heroin is less destructive to the vocal mechanism than crack cocaine.Again, this is a sad day for those of us who loved and admired the talent of Whitney Houston."
1,THIS C.D SUCKS D I C K,"Ok, what the hell. How can some one bare to listen to this cd with out laughing? The whole c.d is just HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, AND ONCE AGIAN....HORRIBLE. I bought the c.d to see if all these bad reviews were true and guess what THEY WERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! anyone who likes this c.d should be shot! Oh my god u dont know how horrible this cd is. I played it in my car for my friend when i first got it and she was CRACKING UP LAUGHING at how sucky this cd was. then my other friend just got pissed cause he wasted his time listening to it....SO NOW WOULD U LIKE TO BUY THIS CD"
3,crack is wack,crack is wack whit's lost it here her music sucks now we are tired of watching her and that trainwreck husband of hers will one of them please OD already and take brit and lindsay lohan with you.
5,Whitney has an amazing voice,Item arrived on time and in great condition. Whitney left us with memories of her excellent voice to enjoy listening to over again when we need a pick me up.
2,Maybe Next Time Whitney,"I am the biggest WH fan in the enire world. Her voice is amazing. However, her latest work Just Whitney is not very good. Her tone has deepened dramatically. There are no more ballads that have meaning in her work. The overall album seems unfinished. These songs don't seem to match Whitney's vocal abilities. Yes, I know she has some issues right now, but it seems as though she is trying to go more urban and steer away from the adult contemporary music. However, that is what she is known for. This album is a HUGE let down to me. Even the ballads are mediocre. What is happening to you Whitney? Why did ARISTA allow you to come out with this album? ALl eyes are on you at this time but yet you come back with material that fit a teenager like ASHANTI or MONICA. Please come back with the DIVA worthy material."
4,"Whitney, Whitney, Whitney","I am one of the biggest Whitney Houston fans their is, and I have to say that this record of hers is good. Her best one was ""My Love Is Your Love"". And we all know and she even know why? Clive Davis. This CD is too short, like she was in a hurry to finish this. Like she was on a deadline. I think she needs to go back and do it right. There are 3 songs that are my favorite. The rest is not that good. ""Tell Me No"" is one of the best songs she has ever done. I love the hell out of that one. ""Unashamed"" is another good song. Her range on some of the songs don't go past a F minor. Now, we know she can get up there.I just wanna hear the Whitney Houston that everyone loves. Her voice is like no other, and I wish that she would get it together and do it right this time. She is letting Celine Dion beat her. Celine is Whitney now. I love Celine, but Whitney you know what you gotta do. I love You, Whitney."
3,Ode to the Original king or R & B,"I like Whitney, it's not hot stuff, but it's okay. Most of the tracks sound like an ode to Bobby Brown. Okay, we already know she loves her man (why? noone knows). Granted, the track with mr. bipolar is ok. The cd in itself is okay, but it's not the Whitney I am used to hearing. I have all of Ms. Houston's music and this is not her greatest work. I know the music stars can't have a multi platinum hit every single time, but it's just okay. It didn't make me want to hear the entire cd again...."
3,much better thn the MM-1,"I had the original mm-1 korg earpiece metronome which was total crap and never played for longer than a few minutes. Changing the batteries in the mm-1 brought its final death. This mm-2 is much larger. In light of the modern bluetooth earpieces for mobile phones I feel this could be vastly reduced. Nonetheless, it fits comfortably around the ear and works like its supposed to. It plays very softly, but once attached to your ear you can hear it well. (There is a volume control that is easy to get to even when attached to your ear.} It doesn't mute though, which would be a plus, since you have to turn on and off again if you want the beating to pause for a short while, which could be a drag as it breaks your rhythm. The volume control does not go right down to nothing. There is also no light so it cannot be used in the dark. There is an additional faceplate - for what reason I don't know. Who has time to change the color of the gadget?"
4,Good value,"We bought 5 of these for our family two months ago. We were previously Nokia and Motorola users. We made the transition fairly easily. Pluses: big keypad, big, bright display, decent sound quality EXCEPT for the speakerphone, nice camera with video. Minuses: iffy batteries (one phone had to have the battery replaced within two weeks), poor quality speakerphone, annoying placement of PTT button, too much emphasis on web access functions for those of us who don't like using a phone for our internet connections. Bottom line: if you're looking for a good, cheap phone that does all of the basic things well and has a nice set of extra features to play with, this is the one for you!"
1,not good,"Not good, stopped working after 2 weeks, next time buy new or refurbished stuff. Waste of money to buy used item that stops working shortly after purchase and this is second time it happened."
1,WRONG PHONE!!,so my boyfriend bought this phone off my account and was thinking he would receive the phone it described..no!! he was sent a completely different model..needless to say he returned it..
1,Junk!,"Had this same model for years. It finally died. Couldn't blame it though. Bought a coulpe of other phones (with other plans), but always had my original as a backup. I like flips. Anyway, it finally died as I said. Found this replacement on Amazon. Brand new. Outstanding! Even got it early. Charged it. Inserted sim card. Right from the get go started messing up. Losing calls(in and out). Losing messages like crazy. And this comes at a very small point in time when I have to be in touch with an elderly family member, otherwise it wouldn't be so important. So now I'm back to ""the slider"". Nothing against Amazon. But this thing is pure junk! I would return it, but it wasn't that expensive, and if I need one in a pinch, I'd still have one."
1,Absolutely hate this piece of junk,"How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways........1. The noise it makes when turning it on and off.2. In order to use the phone, I have to be standing outside in a area completely devoid of trees, buildings, power lines, even cars. If it is a cloudy day or raining, forget using it.3. The stupid PTT button on the side is in the way.4. Ringtones installed on the phone - where did they find that awful stuff?I had a Nextel and switched to Cingular when my children moved out of state so it wouldn't cost them to call me from their Cingular phones. Needless to say, we don't talk much because my phone doesn't work unless I'm standing in the middle of an empty field or parking lot. I am planning on going back to Nextel. Oh, I've only had the phone for two months."
2,A bad choice.,"As another reviewer said, the LG CU400 makes earsplitting noises every time you turn it on or off. The first time my mother heard it, we were in the car and thank God nobody else was on the road or we would have crashed. She was so startled by it. The sound is a CLEAR deal-breaker and I wish I could crack this phone in half most of the time. Oh, and its battery! Runs out of Power in no time at all."
1,Lousy phone,"This has got to be the Yugo of all cell phones. The loud start up noise is one item, the inability to download ringtones, or much else for that matter, and the lousy service. Our Nokia phones worked just fine on Cingular (this week AT&T, next week ???) but this one can't seem to hold a signal to save it's sad little soul. You'd be better off with a pair of tin cans and some kite string. Cheaper by far and considerably more reliable."
2,Bluetooth won't connect,"This is a great phone that actually works in my office building and in my server room ( I am in the IT department). I have been through two phones and the phone and my computer will see each other, I can not transfer a file. They will not connect. It will not connect with my headset or my GPS. Cingular and Lg have been no help. other phones have connected via bluetooth to these devices, so it has to be the phone."
3,"Powerful, but...","These magnets are very strong, hard to pull off steel surfaces. However, they're one-way magnets! By that I mean that when the magnet side (the black side) is stuck to a metal surface, nothing will stick to the shiny chrome surface, and conversely the chrome surface won't stick to a metal surface. That limits their usefulness -- I had hoped (maybe naively) to be able to stick the magnet to the refrigerator and then stick a kitchen knife to the magnet. Doesn't work that way! Oh, well -- I'll find other uses for it."
1,Only 1 in package,"Buyer beware! The photo clearly shows 2 magnets. I received a different package with the same model number, but only 1 magnet. Now that I've studied the ""fine print"" I see that it is a bait and switch situation. They show one photo for 2 magnets that aren't any of the options on their pull down list. You will receive just one magnet. Amazon has agreed to refund my purchase price. But proper representation would have avoided the problem."
5,Great Magnet!,These powerful magnets were just what I needed. I use them to attach a space blanket to my car to keep it cool for my dog when I'm parked. These magnets are great - they hold even in the wind.
1,Grossly over-stated pull capacity!,"On the product package label and in Amazon's pre-sale description, the claim is made that these magnets have 25 lbs of pull. I have ceramic magnets that CAN lift that much weight, but they are much larger.After receiving two of these magnets, I tested both of them on a small, solid steel, 10 lb. anvil. They would not lift the anvil off the ground. Then I tried several other steel objects that weighed LESS than 10 lbs. I finally got it to lift a 6 lb. object.Be warned. The lifting power for this magnet is grossly over-stated. This is reasonable cause for doubt about all other product claims made by Master Magnetics.Next time, I'll seek out a different supplier."
3,OK but not great,"So this magnet will pick up 25lbs of steel, but it would not hold a handgun loaded with 10 rounds of .40 S&W. I wanted to use this for a handgun mount in one of my closets but it would just not support a fully loaded compact handgun. Part of the issue is the smaller profile of the Steyr slide, but it is just not as concentrated as some of the rare earth magnets."
4,Absolutely gorgeous,"This album has selections from a variety of choral works. It is a delight to listen to, particularly the Berloiz selection -- ""The Shepherd's Farewell to the Holy Family"" -- and a perfect holiday gift, which was how I found it. If you liked ""Movies go to the Opera"" or similar albums, you'll like this one."
1,"Very disappointed, you will be too if you buy one of these","The picture shows a fluffy ostrich feather duster, which is what I thought it was.Wrong!What I got was a feather duster made from who knows what type of bird, but certainly not the fluffy dust-gathering ostrich feathers of the stock photo. The feathers are crisp and sharp edged, as if plucked from a shiny-backed duck. The feather duster I got only resembled the handle, and that's where the resemblance ended. The duster I received, which BTW is now out in my garage waiting for a garage sale, merely pushes dust around and makes the furniture look worse.Save your money. You might as well use a stiff restaurant napkin for all the good it does.Hmph!!"
1,Nothing fit,I bought this for my Tundra and it was supposed to fit my year.As I didn't get it installed within 30 days I'm stuck with it. Bearings were smaller than what I pulled off.Toyota put 1 rear in these trucks and I've had it the whole time.And I can't sell it because I don't know what it fits.
2,Not the best one for Mussorgsky,I highly recommend you to check how Nesterenko (Melodya) and Christoff do the same vocal cycles. They are both truly magnificent. I respect Leiferkus' talent but cannot say that he's the best here.
4,Scientific Method for Kids,"This workbook breaks science down for children--they make observations, record the data as pictures and text, and then make predictions and confirm.It covers hypotheses, gathering data, testing hypotheses, making predictions, conclusions and checks.At this age, that's really all that's needed to start kids thinking the right way about science, and it sticks to that concept."
5,Sanctified Soul,"I was searching for some good Gospel music and not being familiar with any particular groups, I was uncertain as to who was good. I happened to be in a 'hole in the wall' of a music store and asked the salesperson where the Gospel music section was. He informed me that he only had used Gospel music CDs and pointed me to a section that looked as if a dust rag hadn't seen it in decades! After looking for about an hour I didn't see anything that looked good. As I was turning to leave, I happened to step on a CD that had fallen onto the floor. It was ""Sanctified Soul"" by Perfect Praise. For some reason, I felt the urge to get this one; after all, it was only $5.00. Man, what a great investment that was! This group is fantastic! The music is so uplifting and the vocalism and harmony are incredible. The words are clear and you can tell that these women know their stuff. I'm excitedly awaiting the release of their next CD."
4,Works for my Yorkie,"After seeing some of the earlier reviews I was a bit skeptical about this product. I got it anyway because it was only $6 and if it works cool and if not then whatever, I'll just go back to what I was doing before. Yorkies are notorious for being difficult to housebreak. With this, and earlier reviews, in mind I really didn't have high expectations. The first time we took her out and sprayed she went right away! I've had it for a week now and everyday she goes when I spray it and has started to go without me spraying. This worked for me. While she doesn't go in the exact spot that I sprayed she will sniff the area and then about 30-45 seconds to 1 minute later relieve herself."
1,Useless,"Simple Solutions is a good brand, but this product is a huge FAIL! i would spray the area where i wanted my dog to use the bathroom & instead of going to the spot, it seemed like he would avoid it. When he did go over to the spot, he would lick the sprayed area. As far as training my dog, it didn't work for me."
1,potty training solution,"does not work. When a return was submitted, I would have to pay to ship it back...not worth it. I would NEVER buy again."
2,doesn't seem to work,I've sprayed this in several places over the past month. I've tried spraying a little and a lot. All my dog seems to want to do is lick whatever I've sprayed.
1,Waste of Money!,Big waste of money. Does not work. Puppy went everywhere but the place I sprayed this product. He avoided it.
4,Excellent tool,"This came with good instructions and seems to be well built. It would have had 5 stars but for one anomaly. There was a template for a 1/2 inch box joint, but the enclosed straight bit was 3/8 inch. My husband did a practice piece first. He said the instructions were good enough that the practice piece would have been perfect had it not been for the size mismatch. He had the appropriate sized bit in his tool box so the joint on the finished product was perfect."
5,ease of setup,"I slowly and carefuly read the instructions and found them to be very well written, which made the setup easy and the test piece came out excellent the first time. thanks for a well made and useful product. My draws came out real nice."
2,Do not buy this jig if you want accuracy.,"You get what you pay for. The alignment guides are out of spec. My left is .505. and the right is .5016. That seems minor, but these guide are what make for perfect joints without sanding. There is a reason they are back ordered. They are just stamped metal. The templates are also very inaccurate. Plan on spending a lot of stock trying to get this jig set up correctly. Save your money, get the Leigh."
5,"A Five Star Rating is ""Earned"".","In reading the several reviews posted on Amazon, I decieded to go with the Porter Cable 4212. Well,that decision was a good one and the Reviews were right on with the praise of the DoveTail machine. Simply put, ""great"", and so convenient with the new locking handles. Much improved from some years ago when the adjustments were not ""so easy."" This 4212 is very easy to almost ""Master"", (ok, I said ALMOST) with the set up and adjustments going from different sizes etc. I don't think one would go wrong with it if you take the time to study the directions (instructions, guys) and follow them. Have fun and enjoy the new and improved DoveTail Machine."
4,superb product,"This is an excellent product for making dovetail joints for drawers, etc. Once set up, it makes accurate joints time after time.There are some caveats though:1) All wood must be square and of exactly the same widths2) Set up does take time for:a) Figuring out the router bit depth. The depth guide does not come pre-set for the correct depth. Onceyou find the right depth, you must then set the guide.b) You should make sure both right and left edge guides are properly set. The instructions only tellsabout the left guide which (the instructions do not state) are for all left side of drawers back andfront. When you go to set the right side of your drawers, you must also set that edge guide correctly.c) It is handy to have scrap wood to support the other edge of the template and to avoid chip out whencutting."
4,Great tool with some limitations,"I needed a jig to cut dovetails for drawers and dovetails and finger joints for boxes. This one filled the bill for a price that I could afford. I would have prefered to have one that is more flexible, but the PC 4212 does what it is intended for very well.A tip: Get some inexpensive wood and spend a day in the shop playing with the jig, making mistakes, and learning the ins and outs of using it. The manual is very poorly written and disorganized, so you will have to learn a lot on your own. Once you do, however, you will be pleased with the outcome.If I had the ability to make a video, I would like to make one to sell to new owners of the 4212. It could save them some time and shorten the learning curve."
4,Making much better joins now...,"I have used this jig for two projects, one with oak and the other pine. Both projects have turned out better than I hoped, and I have plans to buy the template for smaller projects. The only complaint I have is the front clamp requires having a second piece of wood in the clamp should your project piece be too narrow to allow the cam to close properly. It can take a bit of fuss to get both pieces in at the same time, but so far I have learned to deal with it.I still highly recommend this jig."
1,Need For Instruction,"I like the size of the dovetail jig and it's apparent possibiliities. However, I think that a DVD or Video explaining how to use it would be very helpful for a beginner. The language of the pamphlet is probably very good for one who understands all the vocabulary used in it but it is harder for a beginner - I am just trying to learn how to use the jig. A DVD would have helped me to use it very soon with confidence."
5,Dovetail Jig,"Best one on the market, bar none. Its all metal, heavy and well made.The instructions stink. So if you are a beginner, have lots of scrap wood to work with until you get the hang of dovetailing."
5,PC Dovetail Jig,I have seen several reviews stating the instructions are next to worthless. I don't understand this because my jig had plain and very well written instructions. I was also able to download the supplemental instruction manual which gives instructions on various decorative dovetails and box joints that can be created with the jig. I originally bought the 4212 but bumped it up to the 4216 model to cut 1/4 inch dovetails and box joints. Don't believe all the negative reviews because this jig is simple to set up to cut perfect dovetails and box joints with a bit of patience and common sense.
3,not so perfect jig,i've only used the jig for a week now and only to makethrough dovetails. it's well built with easy to use knobs andcams. I am building kitchen cabinet drawers with dovetails all four sides.This becomes difficult on this jig. Directions are not as thoroughas they simply need to be in order to do this. It will take you quite a fewtests to get it set up. The problem for myself has been getting all four sidesto align perfectly. This is accomplished only by using both sides of the jigduring set up and marking your boards carefully ; it took quite a few tests to figure out how to accomplish thiswith some amount of repeatability. It's no more than a decently built jig and affordable.I will likely sell the jig when finished and purchase the D4 Leigh.
4,"overall great product, but needs better instructions","I am a first time dove tail jig user but the recommendations on this product were very high. I found that once you figure out exactly how to work this product the process goes quite well. The out of the box instructions were missing important details (clearer explanations) on setup and going online to the manufacturer really didn't help either, specifically in the area of router bit depth setting. Trial and error ultimately got me my setup and now I can breeze through a setup. Overall I am happy with the product."
4,Just what I needed,"I love making different types of joints for my projects. I'd always wanted to use half blind dovetails on drawers, saw the 4212 did that and a lot more. It was delivered (free) in 2 or 3 days after ordering, It took a couple hours to read the instructions, set it up and start cutting. I'm just a weekender that likes to make sawdust, but the 4212 was just what I needed. One minor problem is availability of replacement dovetail bits. I'm sure when this jig gets a little more widespread, the bits will too. Great tool, I'll give it 5 stars when bits are more available."
2,Not really happy with this Porter-Cable Product.,This should be simple to use but there is something either wrong with mine or the design of it. I must have cut 50 set up dovetails and I am still not happy with them. Seems like there is too much play in the setup stop.
2,Porter cable 4212 dovetail jig,"I also burned up a lot of wood trying to figure out why my pieces do not align after doing half blinds.I'm making a upright chest for my daughter and the dvs are critical for the drawer construction.After a few days of running scrap,I ran the pieces for the drawer,all were off.I thought the same thing about the left guide and now have proof that I'm not goofy.For the money, I think a lot of small things could improve the use of this DT jig. Bad design.I have a call in to porter, if they tell me about a backlog, I'm sending this back to Amazon.Sorry I didn't see this review till I after I tried it."
3,"Takes some practice, and extra wood for testing and support.","This isn't an install it and do it tool. It takes some practice and even at that it isn't a ""just throw the wood in and go"" tool, like I had hoped it would be. I'm disappointed that the box joints aren't as snug as I thought they would be, and I find it difficult to align the initial cuts so the second end cut on the same piece has the same centering. I know of others with different jigs, and they seem to have the same problems with them, so perhaps there is no better way."
3,"Decent Jig, Missing Instructions","This is a decent starter jig and works fairly well for half-blind dovetails for use in drawers. The dust collection capabilities are non-existent and the instructions are mostly useless. There is little or no help on bit depth setting. This is a critical part of the setup process. Expect many trial and error sessions getting the joints to come out satisfactory. FYI start the depth setting procedure by considering the thickness of your board plus about 1/4"" for the collar/guide."
4,"Nice jig, but....",The jig was well packed and went together without much fooling around. Setup was also easy. I have used it a few times and am pleased with the results.BUT; it comes with 1/2 inch shank router bits that are of an odd size and hard to find in 1/4 inch shank. That means you have to use a larger size router. This makes cutting dovetails more difficult than it needs to be. If you could use a smaller router that takes 1/4 inch shank bits it would be a huge improvement.
3,what was left out of the desciption - 4212 Dovetail Jig,"I make cabinets and I have been wanting to upgrade the build quality of my drawer boxes. I use a common material for box construction (1/2"" birch plywood). I wanted to use the dovetail dado for the rear of the box, but the dovetail is meant for thicker stock. The width of the dado at its narrowest point is wider than the 1/2"" stock. I haven't finished experimenting with dovetails on the front of the drawer, but I think it will be absolutely necessary for a backer board as tearout on plywood without one is terrible. I don't look at this as bad design, just that the dovetail bit may not be intended for use on plywood products. Outside that I thought the using the dovetail jig is a bit more complicated to set up and use for commercial use. It's definitely for the hobbyist."
4,Very Good Jig,"This is a very good dovetialing jig the manual is junk but, you should be able to make good tight joints, dovetail and box"
4,Metal plates are nice,I have used jigs with plastic guide plates in the past and the metal is the way to go. Enjoy.
1,Not what was expected,"The jig is on its way back to Amazon! Looked nice outside of the box...first I tried a trough dovetail, after 45 min of adjustments finally was able to cut a decent one.Next tried a half blind one...first I noticed that the template was warped about 1/32"", second adjusting the template took about 8 hrs.! finally again was able to cut a decent joint but not perfect.Next I tried a box joint, after two unsuccesful tries, I packed everything and sent it back.Now I will do what I should've done in the first place and look for the best price on a LEIGH D4!!"
5,"Love it, love it, love it!","Manuals have been updated to be easier to follow. Jig does exactly what it advertises and does it well. I would recommend this product to a friend, definitely."
4,A great tool with a bit of help,"I really like this jig - it does just what I need. I will admit that I had some problems getting things towork at first. I found that I needed to support both pieces around six inches beyond the clamps toget things to cut well. I ended up building Woodsmith Magazines' ""Portable Dovetail Jig Workcenter""and now I'm REALLY HAPPY! Take a look at supporting the pieces if you can't get the dovetails as clean& snug as you might like - you'll be happy you did."
5,Quality item,"Very well made. Excellent instruction manual. Comes with two jigs, one of which is ""concealed"" in the packaging, so try not to throw it out with the packaging."
5,Solid,"This jig is very solid. I have used dovetail jigs in the past and they haven't been nearly as strong or machined as well as this jig. The instructions are a bit confusing, but after reading through them a couple of times, I got it."
4,A tool that helps us succeed,"Our small cabinet/custom furniture shop sometimes makes dovetail drawers for higher end projects - we recently picked up this PC jig and it works super. Our kit included a PC router, which is nice since you can set the router and jig once and forget it. If you can't dedicate a router to dovetails, there are a few test runs required to get it set just right, but after that you're good to go. -Rob"
2,Warped template,"This seems like a good, solid dovetail jig. The fact it can take several different templates gives it some versatility. Working with it, the jig seems a bit clumsy to adjust, as I am used to working with a Keller jig on a router table.My main complaint is the fact that the half-blind dovetail template was completely warped and not useable. Will be sending that template back for a replacement."
2,Works great but battery shot in 14 months,"Functionally this light was excellent new with a very strong beam. It was used only occasionally, and probably charged 2x per month. After a year the battery life was very poor and by 14 months it was not rechargeable at all. As with many Chinese produced items, I suspect the quality is highly variable."
5,Good Spotlight And Very Bright!,"Had exact same very similiar flashlight for a few years that I kept in my truck, VERY VERY bright!!! Price is half on Amazon compared to stores. Finally the battery would not take a charge so orderd another flashlight. For the price here not a bad portable spotlight!"
1,vector 127Y Spotlight 1 million candlepower,Junk! when you need a new battery after about 5months you will find they don't exist! so you can throw your light and money away.
1,Don't buy this spotlight,"After 4 months and 3 recharging cycles this spotlight has now failed to accept a new charge. As stated by others this is a poor spotlight, yes it is small and lighter than several others but if you can't charge it what good is it?"
2,False advertising?,"The web page says ""1-Million Candle Power."" However, the packaging and documentation just say ""1-Million Power."" Why would they omit the word ""Candle""? Perhaps because it's not really one million candlepower? Would you buy a car that's advertised as having ""500 Power?"" I would have returned this on principle, but I did not have time. Seems to work well enough, but I doubt it's really ""1-Million Candle Power."""
2,Disappointed,"When I ordered this book from Polyreader through Amazon, the book MARY IN HASTE was laughingly described in ""Good"" condition. Although the pages were not falling out, the book arrived stained and 'crooked'. Yes, I can read the oddly shaped novel. I would identify it in ""Poor"" condition. Part of the problem may have been the lack of packaging. Sending what appeared to be a hard bound book in a cut out paperbag with an address on the outside I don't count as packaging. On the flip side, I love the story... adore the author and I am happy that I do have a copy... bedraggled though it may be. I will NEVER order from Polyreader again. 4.8 out of 5 stars???? Hmmmmm..."
4,Quick read,"This is a book set in the middle ages. I guess it would be considered a historical romance. Not sure if there is any real substance in the events that occurred so much as it is set in the time period and ""could"" have happened. It is a quick read and has a couple of twists at the end. This book has the capability of evoking emotion while reading. You may find yourself getting angry with some characters and frustrated with others. Very enjoyable and actually has a good plot."
1,Don't buy this,"It should be taken off. We're on version 8.0 of SPSS Clementine and this is a review of 6.5 from someone who apparently has never used the program. Also they talk about features that aren't even in the current version.I only purchased this because I'm interested in data & text mining and this seems to be the only document on Amazon.com about SPSS Clementine.Tom AndersonAnderson Analytics, LLC(...)"
2,Unimaginative,"Overall, pretty boring and predictable. Basically, just a bunch of songs about weed, but not half as creative as similar songs by other underground hip-hop artists, or even Cypress Hill."
4,Mother at Heart by Robin Elliott (Large Print Silhouette Special Edition),"Description from the book back cover:Mother at Heart - Raising her late sister's baby had been a joy for Tessa Russell. But now her family's happiness was threatened by her unwelcome desire for an arrogant, impossible man - a man who would never acknowledge this child as his ... Father by Chance - Dominic Bonelli wouldn't believe it, no matter how much the boy's alluring mother conjured up dreams of a fairy-tale family. That is, until he saw little Jason ... and the telltale sign members of Dominic's family all sported: the infamous Bonelli ear. Was it possible after all, that the irresistible tyke really was a Bonelli - and his son?"
5,independent filmmaking at its finest!,"in a day and age where all the big studios seem to make are remakes and sequels - it's so refreshing to experience a fresh voice, and a genuine, original story from the heart. Highly recommend!"
5,"MUST READ: for all, esp politicians and law practitioners","For any citizen who wants to contribute to our nation and make a difference, I urge you to read this book. I will not reiterate what is already eloquently written in the book but I must say that the values and the contents of the book are priceless.Anyone who is planning to be a politician or going to Law school, please read this book. You will do your nation a favor and your own self a big favor."
3,God and Government,"I've read a number of books about the relations between Church and State - not as many as I should have, perhaps - and Mr. Colson makes many similar points as those. Seeing it from the perspective of a politician is an interesting aspect, but I think that he's trying to gently introduce the ideas to a cynical audience that isn't already well-versed on the topic so I'm finding it a little heavy on the story-telling and a little light on the details. (Of course, I'm a detail person, so most books seem a little wanting in that department.)"
2,Liars!!!!!,"I am giving this set a low score based on 1 specific fact. Toolprice did NOT send me a set of GRIZZLY carbides. They sent me a set of NEIKO carbides, which sell on a seperate amazon listing for about $10 cheaper. The Neiko carbides work fine, but I paid for Grizzly and I expected Grizzly. The only reason why I didn't send them back, which I should, is that I need them for work very badly.It also took Toolprice almost 3 weeks to get them to me. That is far too long.If you need carbides DO NOT order from Toolprice. Either order directly from Grizzly or find a listing for a Neiko 8 piece carbide set instead."
2,Where's the substance?,"I guess I expected too much from this book. I couldn't get past the first 30 pages without feeling it was written for Jr. High Family and Health class. Think of it as the ""light"" version of parenting advice. If that's what you're looking for, here's your book. Examples (with a dose of sarcasm:)Did you know that fat and sugar makes kids fat?!Did you know that kids should wear helmets when skateboarding!?Did you know that kids should dress warmly on a winter's day?!"
3,"It's fine, but there are better choices","If this were the only disk available of these works, I'd be thrilled. But the alternatives on the Dynamic label with Milan forces in the Concerto, and the Edison Trio on Stradivarius, are on an infinitely higher level interpretively.The Trio Kreisleriana, while fully-professional, is rhythmically slack in both pieces, so much so that the feeling comes across that the conductor is battling the Trio K to move things along. This compromises to some extent the very real contribution of an excellent orchestra that could have been used to far more effect.This disc isn't expensive and the engineering is first-rate. It's fun to have in your collection, but if space is at a premium, buy Rizzi/Panni and the Edison on their alternative offerings."
4,Great book - but one minor gripe,"All reviewers' superlatives are justified about this great book, which taught me to play chess at a reasonable ""club"" standard back in the '70s. As a reviewer said, it teaches you that there's a reason for every move, and that in itself helps you play better. (It's also a lesson for dealing with life's problems generally.)Years ago I lent my copy to a friend, who to this day claims I gave it to him! Amazon was the only place I could find it, but I was slightly disappointed that the 1998 edition uses algebraic notation (e.g. e4).For those of us who learned to read chess games using the good old descriptive notation (e.g. P-K4), the algebraic may slow us down a bit. For me it also spoils my expected nostalgic reunion with Chernev's book. But even if I'd known about the notation in advance, I'd still have happily bought the book."
2,Difficult for a kid,"I like having every moved analyzed. But, sometimes this book makes it hard to understand for a kid. I also got UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSON FOR JUNIORS, which solved that problem - I liked it a lot more because it made things more simple.I don't care about the openinigs or endgames as much as just understanding what the book is saying. The problems is that the book sometimes goes off on things that as an intermediate player for age 10 I feel are not needed."
3,"Good, but not the best book of its type","The idea of explaining the idea behind every move is a good. I wish that more books would do this for the Beginning and Intermediate level chessplayer.There are several problems with this book; 1) The book is overly repetitous - it should spend more time going into new ideas, and 2) It often would not answer the questions I had about a move or what was going on it the game, and 3) The coverage of the openings is a bit dated. However, overall I can still recommend this book.This book does not compare in quality to my favorite book, ""Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors"" which just recently came out."
3,"Good, but not the best book of its type","The idea of explaining the idea behind every move is a good. I wish that more books would do this for the Beginning and Intermediate level chessplayer.There are several problems with this book; 1) The book is overly focused on the opening - it should spend more time going into the middlegame and endgame, and 2) It often would not answer the questions I had about a move or what was going on it the game, and 3) half the games are of the author, who is only a measly master. However, overall I can still recommend this book.This book does not compare in quality to my favorite book, ""Logical Chess, Move by Move, which just recently was updated."""
4,One of the best books for beginning players!,"I read the old edition (descriptive notation) of this book years ago and although it was somewhat ""hard to read"" due to mainly the notation the games themselves were very instructive and I feel I got a lot out of it. This edition seems (I haven't gone thorugh it cover to cover) to have corrected some errors and of course the notation issue so I'd imagine it's easily in the ""Top 10"" beginning/intermediate books on chess."
5,Staple in Chess Education,"The problem with most books containing annotated games is that they don't explain the simple moves and the moves they do explain they explain with a long list of variations that lose the advanced-intermediate chess player (defined as up to class C). This book does not fall under the same trap. It clarifies every move (though a little repetitive) and does so with excellent writing. It is truly a chess classic.Cons: The only minor problem with this book is that it is outdated. There are several other books that do the same thing this book does (Winning Chess Brilliances by Seraiwan and another book by John Nunn), but these are much more expensive. The openings in this book are noticeably a little unused and many of the modern openings are not addressed. However, for the most likely audience, this shouldn't be a problem."
4,Move by Move Analysis - Great way to learn chess!!,"""Logical Chess"" is a logical way to teach chess. Games taken from play by strong players are used to provide neat lessons. To make sure everything that is important is covered one or more comments (and sometimes other move suggestions and comments) is made on all of the moves. [...] But that doesn't change the fact that ""Logical Chess"" is a classic and very good book to consider once beyond the beginner stage."
5,Connecting the dots,"This was not the second chess book I purchased, but it should have been. Instead, I bought books on openings and strategy - a big mistake.I think chess books come in three varieties.1. Introductory overviews (how the pieces move, notation, etc.)2. Annotated games3. Specialized topics (strategy, tactics, openings, middlegame, etc.)A good annotated game book connects the dots. It shows how all of the specialized topics work together in real games. By explaining every move, Chernev shows the beginner how to:1. Control the center in the opening2. Develop pieces with purpose3. Use your pieces together to gain material4. How to finish the ""won game""These are foundations that will help all beginners. Yes, the book is repetitive, but the repetition does drive home the point. Now, with algebraic notation - it is even better. For these reasons, I give it 5 stars."
4,Logical Chess Explained,This is a very good book for beginners.I enjoyed going through it while taking the bus to work and back home. Only thing to remark is that sometimes when you are between two board pictures (4-6 moves)then the author will go about a really long alternative combination which is tough to follow if you dont have the updated board.Otherwise this book is very good and will help you play better.
5,Great Beginner's Book,"Ever wonder why chessmasters invariably play Nf3 or Nc3 in the opening? Why are most games opened with either e4 or d4? Chernev annotates several complete games move by move in detail. After reading this book, my vision of the board improved and I began to be able to reason my way through problems."
4,awesome chess book,"This book is a collection of 32 games that Mr. Chernev explains move by move. There are plenty of diagrams in this book (probably two per pages) but you will still need to use a chess board or a chess engine when working through this book. It challenged me as a beginner but at the same time it was not so difficult that I could not follow it. One drawback is that he conveys the same ideas over and over again, one game after another. The repetition is good because it forced me to really remember the points that he was trying to convey but at the same time it can get a little boring after a while.At this point I'm a little more than half way through the book and planning to finish it. This book brought my chess game to a whole new level."
5,it works fine,The mount works and is relatively inexpensive. Not sure what else to say as I needed a replacement when my original mount fell apart and this is a fine replacement.
4,Very sturdy,"This item is very sturdy, unlike my last. I love how it's designed. It is a longer than the factory model."
5,Thank goodness for quality,"I have a Garmin GPS & I didn't put the little disc thing on my window to hold the mount. So, it never stayed up for long. I looked for a while till I found this AKRON GN115 unit. This thing is worth every cent. I didn't put the disc up with it either, but it is yet to come off the windshield. Good price, excellent job."
5,The one Garmin SHOULD have made,I bought this to use with my Garmin Nuvi 360. The mount that came with it was nothing but a problem. It kept falling off the windshield especially during hot weather. When it would hit the dash it would release and launch my GPS into the air. Finally the old Garmin mount broke. I bought this one to replace it and haven't looked back. It is a much sturdier design and feels more durable. Well worth the price.
3,Careful who you order from,"This mount is much better than the one that came originally with my Garmin GPS. Sturdier and larger suction cup. However watch who you order from. Vendor Navi-Tech insists adhesive disk does not come with mount, and did not include disk in original package, even though description and photo says it does. However, after several emails back and forth, Navi-Tech did send me the disk at no additional charge-all the way from the UK!.UPDATE 8/8/12Have to reduce to 3 stars, After nearly 3 months, the suction cup loses its vacuum. Now, no better at sticking on windshield or disc that the OEM mount. Not sure weather I got a lemon or the cup is defective - though it looks fine. Have tried cleaning mounting surface and suction cup, and it still falls off after anywhere from 1 second to several days, if I can get it to stick at all. Guess I will have to try again, or go with velcro . . ."
3,Not Good in Cold,I was happy with this until I had it for a year and then experience cold weather. Keeps falling off even with the slightest amount of condensation on the windshield.
5,very good item,I like my new windshield dashboard mount. Even my husband says that it is much better than the original that came with the GPS. I am in general very happy with it.
4,really good and i recommend,Suction cup is really good and working excellent. better than Garmin suction cup. I recommend this product. Garmin should use this suction cup for better quality.
1,item not as advertised,"This GPS mount does not fit the Garmin Streetpilot C330 as indicated in the distributors information. Do not buy this mount for the C330.The distributor does not accept Canadian PayPal accounts, so I ordered through Amazon and had it sent to my US winter address. Now I am home in Canada, I can't return it without facing huge shipping costs (in comparison to the cost of the product.)"
1,Fell off first try,Terrible terrible terrible. Looks like a strong product but couldn't support the garmin to the windshield. Do not buy... False reviews on here.
5,Works well,Bouight this for my daughter to replace her Garmin provided mount. This one is much more sturdy than the original and works well.
5,Better than the original from Garmin,"I purchased the item for my Streetpilot C550 to replace the aging original suction cup. I agree with many reviewer that this item is much better than the original from Garmin, and the ball size works perfectly for my Streetpilot. The only issue if you may, is that the suction is so strong it is hard to take it off the windshield even after unlocking the suction cup."
5,I wish I had bought this years ago.,"I've had my garmin for a few years now with the standard mounting hardware that the device comes with. The vendor-provided mount never really worked that well, always coming loose and falling off. This new mount has been wonderous. It actually holds! And so easy to take off the windshield when I'm done. Very nice product. Highly recommended, even if your standard garmin-provided mount still works."
5,Hangs in there!,"Bought this after my OEM suction mount gave out, was really worried about getting a low price/low quality replacement. This replacement is of better quality and features than the mount that came new with my Garmin 550. Great suction, high quality, fully adjustable, and fits my 550 perfectly. I would recommend this mount, especially when I have seen some mounts for 3x the price of this one."
5,Garmin Nuvi Mount,This is a great mount for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. Beats the original mount by a long shot.
1,No mounting disc! False advertising,"The mount is ok, but I really needed the mounting disc as well, and it did not come with one as advertised. Very upset!"
3,"Good suction, not so good mounting ball","Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. The quality of the suction appears to be rock solid, as mentioned in other reviews. However, the mounting ball is too loose for my Garmin, and the GPS tends to swivel and move around when I touch the screen. Just bear in mind that you'll probably need to add something to the ball (duct tape, perhaps?) to stop the unit from moving, drooping, etc."
1,Deceptive pictures,"Does not fit the Garmin Nuvi 1490. The first 4 pictures are of a different product than the last picture. The last piucture is the pictire of the mount you get. Like I said, 2 very different products. I am returning mine."
4,Sturdy and a good value,"This is a much sturdier mount than Garmin's and works very well. It is a little more difficult to adjust, but I believe it will last much longer."
3,Inferior to OEM suction mount.,"I purchased this item as a replacement for the OEM Garmin suction mount, which I accidentally destroyed by twisting it while it was mounted to the windshield (sheared the attachment points right off). Anyway, this ARKON unit was cheaper than the OEM replacement and advertised as being compact due to its folding nature. In reality, it is bigger and bulkier than the OEM suction mount. This is a minor issue, however, and my main complaint is that the vinyl suction cup on this unit is quite lousy in cold weather. In fact, I cannot get it to stay attached to the windshield on a cold day until the defrost has had a chance to warm up the windshield after 20 minutes of driving. This was never an issue with the Garmin suction mount, which seemed to use softer rubber for the suction cup (though admittedly this did make it less durable, hence the need to replace it)."
4,Nice Gift Item,"My niece likes mermaids so this was kind of an unusual and neat gift idea. She likes it too.Just thought you could see the colored picture even when the light is off, but not so."
1,"broke after few months, warranty is minimal","I like to shop from Amazon, but this purchase was a mistake. I bought this switch, and the product is still working as a switch, but the knobs are low quality and can be broken very easily (which happened in my case, just few months after the purchase. It is made by Standard Motor Products. Amazon redirected me to the manufacturer, but they claimed that ""These switches usually last for more than ten years, but unfortunately the warranty for this product is only 3 months/3000 miles. Sorry we couldn't be of more assistance.""This warranty period is not stated anywhere in the product description. Also, they will not repair the switch, you just have to buy another one.Don't buy it - try to find another manufacturer with at least 12 months warranty."
4,My first Odetta CD will not be my last,"Every time I've heard Odetta, the power and conviction in her voice has always moved me. You don't question that her heart's not in her work. This collection is my first CD of hers, but will not be my last. All I wanted was an overview and a chance to hear more than what I had experienced so far. I'm impressed with the quality and breadth of this collection. There's not a bad song among the ten and it'll all move you.My favorites:""House of the Rising Sun"" jazzy and bittersweet""Cool Water"" sounds just like the title""Midnight Special"" definitely better than the CCR cover, which doesn't convey the song's true meaningRebecca Kyle, September 2009"
2,Not even close to accurate,"I installed the outside sensor in my 1988 4Runner per instructions. The indicated temperature while driving is 15 to 20 degrees above true ambient (Colorado mountains ambient 10, indicator up to 30).I'm going to try putting the sensor somewhere else on the vehicle in hopes that engine heat is affecting it where it is now. If it works acceptably, I'll update this review (I promise)."
2,poor design,"The display numbers are maybe okay for some, but for me I needed larger numbers to be able to glance at it while driving. The night light quit working after a month. So if you can't read it, it's not much use."
3,Nice but flaky,This product was just what I was looking for.I found it to be very accurate but I took some extra time/trouble to mount it on the inside bottom of my front bumper on an extra piece of foam tape.The downside: It quits working at random intervals. Removing and then replacing the battery will 'kickstart' it until the next time.
1,don't waste your $,this is complete garbage. i've enjoyed the temperature reading in other cars but bought this for one that didn't have one. shoulda known better that you can't get anything good for this price. the display would not read nor would it read correctly and the adhesive on the sensor & diplay unit fell off. a good unit is impt. especially when you ski & go from rain to ice on roads.
1,Junk. Wished I'd read the reviews before buying,"Well, as they say, you get what you pay for.Quite simply, this device doesn't work. It picks up the temperature of the car body as the engine heats up. Moving the sensor didn't help. After I moved mine it not only didn't improve the performance, the sensor fell off because the contact surface was no longer sticky enough. It will give you an initial accurate reading of the outdoor temp, but within 15 minutes or so it goes up - a lot. In a cold climate it's absolutely worthless. I wanted to know when the temp was close to or below freezing for obvious safety reasons. It's obvious this thing won't help when it says it's 45 degrees out and it's snowing.This one is going straight into the trash. It's outrageous that this thing is even sold."
1,Cheap.,"Brought this from Wal-Mart. Easy to install, but the display is hard to read day or night. Backlight does not light up the display well. Temperature on mine is about 8 degrees off. Not recommended."
1,short life,"We bought one of these in November 2007. It died in July 2008. Cheap, you get what you pay for."
1,Great...while it lasted (which wasn't long).,I also wish I would have read the reviews first. Mine lived a whopping two months before dying.
3,Works fine,"No issues with this device. Works as advertised. Simple and does the job just fine. It isn't outstanding, but for the price, it's a good value."
2,Good while it lasted,This unit worked fine for about 14 months. Cord wastoo short for mounting in the grill on my van. Switch hard to move- very stiff.
2,Cheap Cheap Cheap,"I've gone through about 3 of these in about 4 years. Either the temp starts giving wacky readings or the display fails. They are widely available at stores and the cheapest one on the market, in more than one way."
5,The Man In the Chair,This is my personal favorite season. The attention and description given to the Pissjugs that litter the park through out this season are hysterical. As usual Mr. Leahey steels the show with his drunken stupor. The stand off at the end of the season bring this season to a climatic peek of the series. Go Ricky!!!
4,Hilarisome!!!,"It's Hilarious, Ricky. Yeah, that's what I said, Hilarisome!! Of course, you'll love this if you're a TPB fan. Plenty of ""Ricky-isms"" along with the rest of the gang."
2,Rediculously overpriced at $53.99,"Strangely overpriced - As of this posting it is more than double the price that Amazon.ca is charging Canadians: $19.99 CDN (and, as of this posting, CDN and USD are at parity). Considering just how unlikely it is that these products are, in any way, different, this seems more than a little absurd. Also note that Canada and the US share a DVD region code, making imports from Canada playable on any American DVD player."
2,Not what I was thinking it was,"I thought that this book was just one book, but it turned out to be a book with many books in it. I was looking just for one book, not like this."
4,Good deal for the money,"A very affordable multi-purpose sound machine with generally easy-to-use controls* and better-than-expected sound quality. Though light-weight, the bulky (and to my taste unattractive) design is hard to fit on the shelves in my kitchen. Also, nothing in the description notes that portable use requires no fewer than EIGHT D-cells. If you choose rechargeable batteries (the sensible choice if you're using batteries most of the time), you'll spend much more money on the power supply than you did on the original player! Myself, I bought an extension cord, so I can't speak to battery life.In short, for a reliable, listenable basic system, this is an excellent choice.*The old-fashioned analog radio tuner can be difficult to use in large metropolitan areas with scores of radio stations. Not a problem if you just stick to a favorite station, however."
2,Lasts until warranty ends,"Lasted only a few months. Great little player except the tape player broke at 6 months old and the CD player stopped working this Christmas at one year old. This player has sat on a dresser, played nightly and gently used. Very disappointed, especially with the good reviews read before it was purchased."
1,Cd player doesn't work,"Normally I don't write reviews much but this cd boombox is not recommended for cd playing. We got a bad one, we tried doing what directions said to play a cd and we tried a couple cds, didn't work for either of them. Very poor, it does work for cassettes and radio but the cd player for us does not work. I highly doubt we'll buy much from this company."
2,NOT THAT GREAT. DON'T RECOMMEND,This isn't a good product. The sound is poor and there isn't anything to adjust the speaker output such as bass and treble. I would return it but it would cost as much as it did to buy it to mail back. I'm not happy.DMD.
1,Product Sucks,"CD player quit after 2 days. I had an Emerson unit before, and the cd player started malfunctioning after 3 months. I have given up on finding a small cd player/boombox. Radio and tape player portion work fine, but not near enough time in the drivers seat to know how long they would last."
4,I like it,"We like this machine very much. We use the radio, CD player, and cassette player on it daily. I love that it is light weight and the prettiest one out there. It's a good price too!"
1,Average until it BURNED UP!,"The player was average and what I expected for the price. I play the cd player at night and haven't used the other features.Last night, 2-28-11, I awoke to the strong odor of smoke and the distinct smell of plastic that is hot or burning. I immediately started a search but quickly found the culprit on my nightstand, the jwin. I unplugged the unit and the odor began to dissipate. There was still faint smoke in the air.Though there was no actual flame showing, the side of the case by the controls was still hot enough to redden my fingers while I was exploring the case and caused me to withdraw them quickly. The case stayed hot enough for me not to touch for several minutes. I removed the unit to outside.In all fairness it worked fine until now."
1,Don't bother,"Speakers worked intermittently the few times I tried using it. Rated battery only because I had to, never tried it using batteries.Returned it after the third try of getting it to work properly."
2,CD player,"The AM FM radio is great, and so is the CD player! Good quality sound and handy buttons on the top so I can operate it even in the dark, after I've gone to bed! I just reach over and push the right button every time ! BUT, the cassette player was a huge disappointment!!! I've had 4 of these jWin CD players and the cassette part always breaks down - while the rest of the functions work fine, I tried ordering a cheap Colby...but didn't like it at all. I wish so much you could improve the cassette player function !!!!!!!!!!!"
1,An insult !,"I only ventured into this purchase because I have a vast collection of cassette mix tapes and my GREAT sound system (Panasonic) decided to quit on me. I was willing to take a chance on something cheap until I found something better. I expected the crummy sound. I did not expect the cassette drives to become erratic after TWO WEEKS of play ! Apparently they are ""variable speed."" This thing should have never been designed, yet alone manufactured.Fooled me.... shame on me !"
1,Very Unhappy,"The radio works ""ok"", but the CD player is junk. Have taken it back to Radio Shack store, he made it work after cleaning it, but it only ""sorta"" worked for 1 CD-playing. Spent a little more on this product, thinking we'd have better quality, but am so disappointed. The other day I dug out a 15 yr old CD player and it works beautifully (and it's not jWIN)!"
2,nice while it lasted,"Great value, wonderful array of features, but the cassette only worked for about 40 hours and then broke."
1,Mr,This boombox was purchased as a birthday present. It didn't work and we immediately returned it to Amazon.com. We refused to enter another order for it preferring to purchase audio products locally. Amazon has a very efficient return process and we were refunded quickly.
4,Good little Boombox,I had to return the first one because it didn't work. This second one is working fine but it hasn't been picking up the radio reception very well. It's okay.
3,The Magician's Workbook : A Modern Grimoire,Not bad. I found it a little confusing really. The second volume is my favorite out of both. I would still recommend it as it does have some really good info.
1,FAKE,This filter is a FAKE. It will void your warranties and is a waste of money. This filter WILL break your machine.
1,Consultants should be banned from writing books ...........,"This is just another one of those dreary books created by consultants marking out their turf and trying to convince people that their particular semantic stir-fry is the path to wherever - in this case ""influencing with integrity"".I cannot remember why I bought it, but flicking through it I'm very disappointed in myself. Clearly I thought it might contain something of value. No such luck."
4,Well Made product/Basin Perhaps too Shallow,"The customer service in shipping the product was excellent. The product is very well made of dense resin. It is very easy to wipe clean and rinse. It perhaps is a bit awkward to fill the pedestal with sand after you run an extension cord up the pedestal in order to plug in the basin. After you plug in the basin you must push the cord bit down into the sand in order to screw the basin onto the pedestal. But it is not that difficult. The basin, though, is so shallow that you need to fill it every other day in order to keep water in it during cold weather. The heat of the basin evaporates the water. I wish the basin was a bit deeper but I like the product. It is functional and very good looking in the yard. And when the pedestal is filled with sand, it is very sturdy. Squirrels jump up on it all the time and it doesn't move."
5,Heated birdbath,"It's a very clever concept and is sturdy when filled with sand. I don't know about the heating capability yet, because the weather isn't yet cold enough for the water to freeze."
3,Birds love it!,"Yes, it's a bit pricey. My first impression when taking this out of the box was, ""are you serious?"". Extremely light-weight and very shallow in the middle where the heater is. I was not impressed. I filled the core with pebble-rock to make it secure and bought a heavy duty, outside cord to plug it in with. It doesn't get as warm as I thought it would, but it does keep the water from freezing over and that's the important thing. The best thing is, it's simple to clean (a bit messy though). All in all, with what's on the market for these (which isn't much of a selection), yes I would buy it again. The birds need something for water during the winter and it does work..."
4,couch fisherman,I enjoyed this book immensely as I do almost all of his books. He shares many of his unusual episodes on the trout stream with such color as to hypnotize you.
3,Letdown,A little disappointed in the book. Not as entertaining or interesting as I was expecting. Some chapters seemed to ramble on with little direction or clear thought.
5,Rave review,"This is a terrific book. Bite-sized, hilarious chapters. required reading for fly fishers, but captivating for everyone else as well"
5,Truth in a tiny box,I've seen young people create beauty. It's much more rare to see a young person create poignancy. Noe Venable can bind contradictions in one image so true you don't know if your heart has been broken or given wings.
1,Don't Bother,"I was shocked at just how bad this DVD was. The production values are sloppy and the examples given are poor. In fact, and this is not hyperbole, I honestly believe that some of the ""good"" examples given are incomplete, poorly explained or just flat out better examples of what NOT to do. I highly recommend passing on this one."
1,Ultimate Spinach III,"Boring, dull, nothing special with this album. Stick to their first two albums, avoid this album."
3,Heavy !,"This Laser is REALLY heavy when you hold it , didn't expect that.I Just Open the box, Place the wierd shape/look battry which i don't usauly see, start pointing ,looks great and much brigher than the red lasers , but after 1 min. the dot begun to fade slowly . i think you can't use it for a long time , the beam is 100% invicble in the daylight."
3,Good while it Lasted,"Bought this laser about a year ago because it looked so rugged; the shape reminded me of a cannon barrel. Slow arrival and a call to the company diden't help. It arrived in about 10 days. The button you push to turn on the laser broke on day 2...poor design because the replacement, which was handled well, did the same thing in 4 more months. So I'm on the hunt for another green laser because it is so cool to play with."
2,Misleading,"I know, I know, I should have read the description better but hey, it says ""Porter Cable 4210 12 Inch Dovetail Jig"". Not ""Porter Cable 4210 12 Inch half blind Dovetail jig"". Anyone would assume you could do a full through Dove tail right? Ok probably not but just be aware of that fact.If you don't mind spending extra on full and mini full through dovetail jigs then the unit is well made."
4,dove tail jig,"came on time worked well,didnt have any problems setting up or using it based on included directions,would reccomend to a friend"
5,Out of the box accurate.,I have now used this jig several times. Setup is straignt forward. Once set I have found the jig very accurate. The dovetailing bit that is supplied does a good job. I have owned 2 other dovetailing jigs and really never was able to repeat accurate dovetails. This Porter-Cable jig is well worth the money.
1,Missing parts.,"Ordered this jig about two weeks ago. When it came, it was missing all the accessories (shank carbide-tipped dovetail bit #43776PC, template guide #42040, lock nut #42237 and T-handle hex wrench). Called Amazon and had them replace it. Today got the new unit and what do you know, it is missing again. Called PC and had them ship accessories to me separately (they confirmed that those accessories should be included). Now more waiting... But then again, what do you expect from a company that gets bought by Black&Decker. Besides, when the bit goes bad, I have no idea where to get a new one (17/32 7 degrees). Web search didn't produce any results. I guess PC chose those dimension so you could buy it only from them, but they forgot to actually distribute it. If you are going to buy it call Porter Cable first and have them ship the accessories to you."
2,5th Grade Book Club Sponsor,This book had a slow plot. There were also a couple of instances where the bad language was unnecessary. A sense of sadness permeated the book throughout. There was a good lesson in the book because two people who thought they were enemies found out that they could be good friends.
5,A beautiful story,This is the best childrens book I've ever seen. The illustration is beautiful and enhances the story. The description of colour is a great introduction for children into artistic expression and the moral of the story to find beauty whatever you're looking upon is a very nice as well.
2,"Not great, but it was free","My boss was tossing the computer, and I picked it up and made it a Linux server. It's taken about 5 attempts at installation (so far) but hopefully I can get it to work.The computer is slow as hell (450 Mhz Pentium II) and has trouble running Linux. Obviously, no one would buy this computer as a primary machine, but it has worked in our lab for about 7 years. The fact that it still runs is encouraging."
3,My least favorite of the series,"I got stuck about 20 pages into it and from there restarted reading it about four times before I finally finished it. I was inundated with the cast of characters and found it very difficult to keep all the relationships and subplots straight. This, along with the author's writing style of constantly interrupting the sentence flow by inserting other lengthy information right in the middle of it (count the em dashes in the book sometime!) made this book a tedious read. I did enjoy seeing Benjamin's & Rose's relationship further develop, and of course getting a great feel for how life was in 1830s New Orleans."
4,Good Character Development,"This is one of the best mystery series that I have found. The history is interesting and Ms Hambly has a way of making the period come alive. This book, as the fifth in the series, moves the characters forward in their relationships. I like that because, too often, TV shows & books do not allow their characters to grow or change. Like all the books in this series, this book makes interesting observations on the social mores of the time. The mystery is fairly interesting and complex, but that was not my favorite part of the story. All in all, I would recommend this book to any mystery reader or fan of the series as being on a par with the first one. Also a rarity in series fiction"
2,"a total ""clinker""","I have read all the previous Benjamin January books and loved them all, although not all were easy reads. This one, though, almost had me feeling the need to write down all the characters and what part they played so that I could keep track of them. There seemed to be more ""patois"" than usual and couple this with trying to keep up with all the characters, it was extremely tiresome and annoying. I started this book no less than three times, not wanting to give up because I couldn't believe that Ms. Hambly could have written such a ""clinker"". But alas-twas true. Finally I gave up and skipped to the back just to see who did what and found myself with no better understanding than if I had actually finished the book. One of the few books I have given up on-it just wasn't worth it. I hope that the rest of her books are better."
2,Bad Unit??,"Overall the unit is pretty good, though sound and ergonomics are nothing incredible. I am not a big fan of the touchpad scroll but the volume bar on the side is good. The unit I bought has a battery problem and I only get about 3 hours of play instead of 30. The battery seems to go down between uses and goes quickly while playing. Between the battery problems and the touchpad that is too hard to use I am returning this for a Sansa player."
1,Junk product,"I bought one of these to take back to the UK after my holiday in the USA, arrived back in the UK - powered the machine up - dead as a dodo. Complained to Samsung UK, they were not interested as I had lost the international warranty card. They offered to repair it at my expense or I could send it back to Amazon, this latter option was not viable as I would have had to pay customs duty when the repaired or replacement item arrived in the UK so in effect I have a lightweight door-stop suitable for a doll's house or a door wedge. I will never buy another Samsung product as the quality control and factory checking on my sample was apparently non-existent."
3,long battery life and durable but...,"I bought it because it had the 2 features I found important-long battery life and durable for use out hiking/camping etc. The general view has been that the controls take some getting used to-I agree and wish I could have tried it before buying it. Also, I had an easier time putting music on my moms cheapo $30 MP3 player then I did with this one. Sound quality is good, havent used it enough yet to say much else. My biggest issue is not the product itself but the company. Samsung reps are RUDE. I called to inquire about a car adapter (unlike IPODs there are no ""YP-Z5"" accessiories) and was told that if I didnt have a cd player in my car I was out of luck. When I asked if there wasnt ANY adapter I could use since I dont have a cd player-the rep interupted me saying ""listen lady"" and ""most new cars today have cd players"" he ended up hanging up on me. In all, I am soured by the experience and will never order a Samsung product again."
2,broke after one month,This model has not as comfortable menu than the other model that I had befor. After using it for a month it started to freeze. I called customer service and they said it was a common problem....
2,Beware of Samsung Customer Web of mockery and deceit!!!!,"This thing broke after 2 months. The real nightmare is the Samsung support. I had to send it in twice for repairs and twice it came back DOA. To add more stress, Samsung Service did not perform as change of address, despite a dedicated call I made to them for this purpose only. They sent it back the second time to the old address. I own several Samsung products (HDTV, DVD PLAYERS), which have turned out to be mediocre in quality and performance. I will never buy Samsung again.From now on, any electronics I buy will be bought locally and with extended warranties."
4,a good one,"A quirky light-hearted movie. We laughed throughout, even as it pulled at our heart strings."
1,Johnny Depp Starts Here,"WHAT????? I couldnt even get through the first few pages. I wished I had never bought this book. I gave it one star, but the book didnt deserve that."
1,A Weak Book on Johnny Depp,"The book is unreadable. The author seems more intent on displaying a hip sense of his knowledge of film than on providing a serious critical study. And it is badly written: where one adjective would suffice Pomerance uses five, apparently under some misguided illusion of how language works best. Depp deserves better."
5,Christian Dior J'adore For Women 6.8oz Body Milk,The wife loves wearing Christian Dior J'Adore so I bought lots of it as a gift It does smell very pretty!
3,gift,It's a gift so I do not know how good the item is as yet. Not until December. What else can I write?
1,Nothing new,I read about half of this book and there is nothing new in it. It is very outdated and mainly states that any exercise is good.
5,Great Product,"These little wipes are amazing - saves a ton on cleaning bills.Get a spot or stain, immediately use the wipe and it's gone withouthaving to launder. Especially good for people who have a tendency to drop food on ties, blouses, etc."
2,Well known but weak.,"This is a good book that is quoted often, but it is not a well written book, nor useful outside of quotes. ""The Book of Five Rings"" by Miyamoto Musashi is a better read, better organized and more applicable as a transition comparison of ancient asian thought to modern life (which tends to be the use of these books). As far as strategy goes, I have always preferred ""Strategy: The Logic of War and Peace"" by Luttwak. Another very good book (but Intel related) is ""Intelligence and Military Operations"" by Handel. The later is tough to get for a good price. Of course there is ""On War"" by Carl von Clausewitz, often called the most quoted less read military book. In general, ""Art of War"" and ""Book of Five Rings"" can be found on the Internet (Google them with the search option of ""filetype:pdf""). Getting the book is good for that road trip, writing in the margins, and bookshelf."
2,Sun tzu'sart of war the modernchinese interpretation was somewhat interesting but a little tough sled to read,Sun tzu'sart of war the modern chinese interpretation was somewhat interesting but a little tough sled to read. Not an easy read
3,An OK book,"Although I usually see the worst of books wonderful because of some inherent habit of being positive, but no matter how I look at this book, I am sorry to say I can not call it excellent. Some stories are very interesting and offer a lot of new information but many of the stories are dull, pointless and divert from the topic which is a legal thriller. I guess this book can be called a good book if some of the stories were deleted or made more suspenseful or interesting."
3,Blah..,"Not a single short-story is standing out here. That is simply not good enough. Some are readable, some are just retelling plots you've seen/heard/read zillion times before. Not really bad if you get it as a present, but don't spend money on it yourself."
4,An Exciting Adventure,This is such a cool book! I gave up waiting for it from the library and bought it. I liked it as a Christian book with an exciting story line. It kept me guessing right up to the end. I definitely recomend this book. Good on you Gilbert!
1,Not Very Helpful,This video is not very helpful in explaining values and counting coins. It focuses mainly on adding double digit numbers to get a dollar and cent total. If you need something that explains coin value and counting this video is not it.
4,devistating standing cradle,"This book is a must for anyone who has ever wrestled or followed the sport. Irving does a fine job of showing how the physical exertion and emotion he put into wrestling mirrored the creative process of his writing. He is able to capture the sweat, the smells and the camaraderie of the wrestling room while showing that he and his pals were not just a bunch of one dimensional oafs. He concentrates on the creativity and diverse personalities of the wrestlers on his team. Those of you who are former wrestlers who are coaching or who are totally retired from the mat will appreciate Irving's transition from college student, to writer, to family man without ever really losing contact with the wrestling world. Stories about referees and out-of-control sports parents are all too real, but will make you chuckle anyway. A quick read.Iriving shows how all of those old coaching cliches really do apply to life."
2,Not one of Irving's best,"I am a big John Irving fan and have read almost all of his novels. This book was a big disappointment for me, though. Rather than deeply delve into the events and people who shaped his writing, Irving provides perfunctory descriptions of the major events in his life as a writer and wrestler. He devotes much more attention to the scores of every wrestling match he ever took part in than to details regarding the process of crafting his novels. For wrestling fans, this book might be just what you are looking for; for others, I would skip it and re-read Garp."
3,Not Irving's best work.,"I expected more from this book. Irving's memoir is sorely disappointing in comparison to his novels. It's not BAD, it's just not written with the same level of complexity and interest found in his fiction."
2,Real Life,"I loved reading about Irving's real life. He is by far my favorite author of all time, so I found it quite comforting to read that he is just as normal as the rest of us!Some of the details were boring- but what auto-biography isn't?"
3,An Unimagined Girlfriend,I am a tremendous fan of John Irving but I found this slight writing about those who inspired him uninspiring.
5,Great Stand!,"I have been totally stoked by all my PDP hardware, but this is the first 900 series i got. I have to say it feels rock solid!! Will be rocking out tonight to see how it feels.For the price, i love PDP"
5,"Oh baby, it works","Yeah, this stuff is great. All those commercials you have seen with the gum making everything better, well none of that is true. In fact if you are ugly you will still be ugly after having this gum. However if you are ugly and have bad breath you will only be ugly after having this gum. That is the truth, so people with bad breath, please take this opportunity to do a service for the rest of us out here and either do not get close to us and open your mouth or if you can not stop that please buy this gum."
4,Improving Maintenance by the use of Lean Concepts,"It's for those who are looking for direct information. Begin with some Lean historical facts, and goes direct to applications and examples. I found it very usefull and easy to find the information I needed. I would recommend this book for engineers and technicians involved in improving eficience of maintenance activities."
2,Missed the Lean point,"Good maintenance book, but it missed the point on lean by a mile. If you just what some of the lean ideas, but not how they relate to maintenance it may be for you."
5,Perfect!,"I'm a chef and this plank makes getting a cedar roasted salmon a breeze. Just season the salmon, roast it on the plank on high until it's golden! It was it and reuse it. Love my planks!"
1,very weird movie,"i think the movie is very weird for a few reasons. First the whole thing is happening in Russia, but the movie is in english language the ameriacn actors and actreses are made to speak english with a heavy russian accent, and they are not very good at it, i had to run subtitles thru the entire movie. even the fact that i am from the former soviet union myself and i understand russian did not help at all. it is really weird to see Donald Sutherland trying to speak english with an accent. Also they overuse the word ""comrade"", it was never used in everyday communication, it is not a casual word. Also ppls outfits and some other facts are faked and made up. I never finished watching it."
4,Murder in the USSR,"A disturbing look at a true case in which a serial killer was able escape detection for years because of the incompetent and often ideologically-blind givernment. Even when the local authorities agreed to investigate they refused to make the crimes public ""because serial killers do not exist in the Soviet Union.""Even when the forensics expert placed in charge of the case finds the suspect with a knife and a rock in his bag, the weapons used in the murders, he is forced to release him because an incompetently conducted blood test wrongly exonerates him... and because he is a Communist Party member.An interesting study, a real-life Gorky Square."
4,A pleasant surprise,"I live in a rather isolated region. As a result, I find that I lend a lot of DVD's out to people in my area because rental outlets here have little to offer. EVERYONE who has borrowed this little gem has returned it with rave reviews. I predict that you will watch it several times."
5,Terrific performances bring this shocking true story to life,"I have always been a fan of true crime drama. Many leave much to be desired in the areas of writing and acting. ""Citizen X"" is not one of those movies. Superb acting and writing brings this unbelievably reprehensible tale to life. In my opinion this movie blows away ""Silence of the Lambs."" No fictional movie can ever match this true story! As the cover says, ""52 murders in 8 years.""During the 8 years, Stephen Rea chases Citizen X, a prolific serial killer that stalks young victim in Russia. This is relatively a current event, as the story ends in 1990, a time when Communist Russia did not want to acknowledge a serial killer existed their country. This enabling denial permitted some of the most heinous murders in the world.Donald Southerland, Max Von Sydow and Citizen X give outstanding performances. I recommend this movie highly. This refers to the DVD, which is Full-Screen (Originally produced for HBO)."
5,WOW!!!,"This movie is so excellent but so upsetting, I truly don't know the words to use. I can't review it. It was so powerful, so realistic, so horrifying... This is a must see movie."
4,.,"Strong performances by Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland, and Max Von Sydow. The rapport that develops between Rea and Sutherland is a treat to watch, and the film tactfully refrains from smearing its story in Dateline-esque American melodrama. There are certain elements of the case I would've like to have seen explored in greater detail, and a few sequences which do remind you that this was made for cable, but on the whole, this is a quality film."
4,Killer needs compassion!!!,"TV movie - yet, extraordinary!!! Steven Rea, a perfect role. Max Von Sydow is truly special."
5,Great movie..,"Citizen X is an excellent thriller, great story line, superb actors (many locals)... shot entirely in post-eastern Europe. I highly recommend this flick."
4,"Interesting, but good","I found this movie to be slower, as in no shoot em up chases, but it keeps your intrest.You know who the killer is and you want to be able to go in the film and point him out and say, ""THAT'S HIM, GET HIM,"" but you can't because it's only a film.This is a perfict movie if you don't have any plans but to sit at home by yourself and watch a movie."
5,Citizen X movie,"I looked for quite a while for this movie. The disc arrived sooner than expected. I watched the movie twice that night.I thank you for the quick turnaround. I would recommend this seller for any purchase. Thank you for your time.Sincerely, Dennis Petroni"
5,Citizen X,"By watching this movie I realized the Following: The sickness of the mind of a serial killer in real life, is greater than any movie can present. 52 dead women and children! Jesus Christ!"
4,Very good. Rea is brilliant.,"The cast is excellent in this movie. It is a true story, and is more believable (mostly due to great acting by all involved) than most video verite.This movie is worth buying even if you have not seen it. You will not be disappointed."
5,"Before ""NCIS"" and ""Criminal Minds""...","Before the Soviets realized they had a serial killer and did something about it, Andrei Chikatilo had mutilated and murdered more than 50 of his fellow citizens, more than half of them children. The fact that this outstanding HBO film is based on true crime events makes it all the more interesting and shocking.I just watched it for the third or maybe the fourth time, and it's one of the best movies I've ever seen - a gripping and remarkable masterpiece. Like ""The Silence of the Lambs"" remarkable. I applaud the entire cast and everyone involved in the production. The casting couldn't be any better: Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland, Max von Sydow, Joss Ackland and Jeffrey DeMunn (who just wrapped up a two-season run in an equally memorable role as Dale on AMC TV's ""The Walking Dead"" and) who brings to life the eerie and evil Citizen Chikatilo.For fans of true crime thrillers or ""Criminal Minds"" or ""The Walking Dead"", don't hesitate to order this great film!"
2,Disapointed,"The graphics are excellent as well the usic, actually is beyond you could expect except for one little detail... they placed their signature along every video. So if you have a very nice 3D journey you will have to make up your mind to try to erase the logo of the creator that will be present on the lower right corner during the entire video.These guy just didn't want anybody to steal their videos that are actually very goo indeed but they sabotaged the experience by doing that what is a pitty. If I buy a video is to get involved into it. I mean, I wasted my money, instead of getting an actual video all I got was their demo reel."
5,This book wakes up the artist within.,"To say that Kumiko Sudo's Circles of the East is inspirational is an understatement. It is a beautiful book to read, even if you never make one quilt block from it's pages. The whole history of Japanese Crest designs is entertaining enough, but the fact that I could actually replicate Kumiko's art is incredible. I made the Gingko design using my machine with great results although all Kumiko's work is done by hand. Her templates are exact, but she does not include full size placement diagrams. I dreaded getting to the placement part of sewing my block, but it was way easier than I thought...The most interesting aspect of her work to me is her seemingly complete disregard of grainline and total obsession with placement of fabric motifs...it gives her blocks stunning symmetry that I haven't seen anywhere else...really exotic!"
2,Is there an editor in the house?,"M.S. Cain obviously expended a good deal of effort in writing this book. Too bad he didn't employ an editor: poor sentence structure, mixed metaphors, and weak organization of ideas combine to make this a poorly crafted book. He raises some worthy issues, however, and one senses that the book is an outgrowth of his passion for the plight of adjunct faculty, his most interesting chapter. The community college is a growing area for research in higher education. Go to the Teachers College at Columbia University, New York, website for a list of excellently written publications on this subject."
1,Not Kurious.,"Yea, theres been a Kurious around a long while before this untalented biter came along."
5,Great filter,"Can't tell by the naked eye, that it works better than other filters. But it's a K&N I'm sure it does also fits perfectly on my 2006 Suzuki Eiger 400 4x4. Better than buying the OEM filter for more money."
5,K&N Oil Filter,Great filter. Good price if you are buying in mutiples of 3 or more. If you buy 2 may as well and get three since it is almost like getting on free vs the shelf cost at most retail stores
3,Not what I expected,"I generally love K&N; filters and use them on our cars. Not only are they of exceptionally high quality, they are Made in the USA and Lord knows we can use the work here. I bought this filter for my bike assuming the same great K&N; product I've come to know. I was very disappointed that I paid the premium price only to get a filter that while not bad quality, it's not up to K&N; standards and it's not made in the US. It's made in Asia and with the quality not being up to snuff I would pass on this part number.As an aside, Mobile 1 filters are the same as K&N; except they don't have the weldnut on the bottom. Sometimes you can get the Mobil 1 filters for less money if you don't mind not having the weldnut feature."
5,Simply Simple.,"I love the nut on the top of this filter, but I also love that I've used 10 of them over the past two years with nary a complaint."
5,Nice filter,Very nice filter with a good price for my 2009 Suzuki Gladius. I like that I do not need a filter wrench to remove it.
1,Is this almost the worst movie ever made?,"I really kind of want to give it 5 stars just so people would watch it and share my misery. You can have a perfectly agonizing hour and half, and just about 45 seconds in, you start to wonder how much more of this you have to endure just so you could say the movie absolutely sucked. The story is horrible, acting is horrible, set is horrible, and for an action movie, the action is horrible, too. Only redeeming quality is what seems to be a pretty cool looking belt buckle that Kenshiro is wearing. I'm seriously amused that someone bothered to do this and present it to the world, but then the world is full of crap. And probably what's most amazing is that there probably are worse movies out there. Really an absolute waste of money, better spent filling up sink holes, really."
4,Apostolic tradition,The author calls into question popular biblical interpretations on issues such as End Times theology and apocryphal texts. Whether one agrees or not the arguments are well stated and thought provoking. I recommend it.
2,not up to his standards,"He has put out some very good solo work but this one disappoints. He really needs to beef up the writing, and find at least a part-time vocalist. He doesn't have the pipes to carry an entire cd, so he should recruit a vocalist for 4-5 cuts, or get a full-time singer as he did with Glenn Hughes. The solos are not up to his standards either."
1,Not quite beauty...just pain,"This album was a disappointment for me. I'm not a kid...I've been a fan of superchick for a few years now (since LOP). Tracks 1,3,7,and 10 are alright...the rest are filler. Track 9, Courage sounds pretty bad.HLR"
5,"good, clean rock","I was searching for christian music that didn't sound like christian music so I thought the best place to look was christian rock. I bought one album and hated it. It was the kinda of soft, unedgy, bland rock that I wasn't looking for. So for the second trip I took a chance on the new Superchick album, Beauty from Pain. I had faith that a band with a crazy name like ""Superchick"" would deliver on the funk.And they did. If I had to compare I would say they're kinda like No Doubt with their mix of reggae, traditional rock, grunge, and hip hop. And then add a little Evanescene with the angelic female voices blending with the wicked guitars. Superchick is truly Christian rock. I appreciated their ""risk"" of dealing with subject like depression and breaking up with your boy/girlfriend. Out of the 10 songs I love 9 and like the remainig 1. Definitely, absolutely, positively worth buying."
5,"Great CD for older kids, especially girls","I love this CD! The title song, ""Beauty From Pain"", is my least favorite, but I do like all the songs. THey are mostly upbeat, with positive, but not usually overtly religious, messages. The lyrics are just what you want your kids listening to, about self respect, not giving up, optimism... In fact, I even listen to them when I work out. I guess the best thing is the vocals are awesome, the instrumentalists are very talented, the songs are very well crafted, and the production is great! It is rock music we can all agree on!"
5,amazing!!!,"i really recomend this cd! i wasn't really into superchick until i saw them live this february, but i bought this cd and i love it! before i'd only heard 'pure' and 'we live' and, while they're great songs, they really arn't a fair representation of superchick. this is my favorite cd right now!!!"
3,"Loooove superchick, but...........","I was SO excited and anxiously awaiting a new album- I thought after Regeneration...they definetly were going to have a total kick a$$ album! But I pop it in and listen to it....and it's a decent follow-up to Regeneration. I don't like ""pure"" and ""down to the bottom"" personally I think they coulda done w/o 'em, but hey w/e. But Melissa singing ""courage""- she did great! I didn't know she could sing like that- it's a beautiful song. I respect how they've expanded and experimented with new things, as artist ya gotta grow- which they have done since their first album. They've kept me as a fan since they first bursted onto the scene- which is impressive, considering me lol So I suggest buying this album- but if you don't own Regeneration- get it! I give this album 4 stars, the 2 tracks that I don't care for dock off a star. Rock on Superchic[k]!"
4,It was a gift.,Since it was a gift I can't really comment from a musician's point of view but I do enjoy William Joseph's music very much.
4,A Good Hard Read,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. It uses technical language (which can at times can become difficult), to express the physical context surrounding the development of Quantum mechanics, and deal with the matter at hand (pardon the pun). Quantum theory has a reputation as being difficult, confronting and unbelievable. However this book expresses logically and in detail, the physical principles of the Quantum theory, by the great Werner Heisenberg himself.A great book if your thought needs provoking..."
3,"some good content, but not terribly accessible","A lot of the interesting bits are covered in the appendix, but I found it too dense to attempt to read (an attempt to cram too much into a short book).After learning the subject from other sources this would probably be interesting to revisit to get a historical perspective, but I don't rate it high for learning from."
4,Quantum theory is really misterious !!,"This really helping me to understand more about the Quantum Theory, I think this book is need to be read by everyone who study physic or by someone who interested by physical theory. I have been read this book for several times and I stil never feel bored. I think this book is really interesting. Thank's"
4,"Great pedal, but don't expect to sound like Dick Dale","The description is misleading, because no longer how much you crank this thing you're not going to sound like Dick Dale. With that said, this does produce really good reverb effects. Spring and Hall definitely sound good and wet. Flange might be fun to play around with, but it doesn't really have any practical use unless you really want that specific sound. One minor complaint is that when you hit the reverb during a song your sound is going to recede a bit, so you have to turn up the volume some to compensate."
5,The Best Baseball Card Resource,"If you're a card collector, this is the book for you. Every set imaginable is listed by card #, example photo, and value. It even shows card set variations. For example, the 1916 Altoona Tribune set is actually the same as the 1916 The Sporting New set with a different back. This has been an invaluable tool in my quest of the complete Pete Rose collection, as well as, giving me a renewed enthusiasm for the players of old."
2,My Review,This book is filled with baseball cards. If you want to get the price of a card you can open this book right up and find it!
2,car parts,"Very cheaply made ,but it works but the price was right. Hopefully I will not own this car before it goes bad again. I have had problems with other Dorman products. You get what ya pay for."
5,Brilliant Stuff,"Ralph Jacobson is among the very top thinkers in organizational and leadership development today. Working in Customer Relationship Management, where organizational change and leadership challenges are everywhere, I appreciate both the wisdom and practicality he offers. I'm going to make this book required reading for all my clients."
3,Not that funny.,"I was expecting this to be totally outrageous, and hilarious. After reading about 7 of the stories, I was done. Nothing was really that crazy, and none of it was even a little bit funny. It's just stories about a guy who gets drunk too much, and does all the things annoying frat boys seem to do when they are drunk. Lame."
1,Misogynist drivel,"I led have rated this 0 however I did laugh out loud a few times and managed to read the whole book. It never ceases to amaze me I live in a society that romanticize such despicable behaviour. Most of this was disgusting postelizing drivel, a waste of time."
5,Tucker Max ...,This book was hilarious. Reminded me of my brother and even some of my own stories. Can not wait to read the others. I stumbled across this book by accident and I'm so glad I did I could not stop laughing.
2,Waste of Time,"This book reads like it was written by an 18-year-old. There was very, very little actual humor and way too much raunch to make it worth reading. Don't bother."
3,should be rated!,"I did like the book, but hope that my daugher never meets this man or one like him! Some funny stuff, some of it gross."
1,Have another shot...of penecillin,"Too bad Tucker Max stayed sober for the 10 hours it must have taken him to write this repetitious, self indulgent book. I want my money back, if I wanted to be regaled by tales of drunken stupidity I would go to my next high school reunion."
1,Ughh...just terrible. Not even funny just sad,"He admits to being an a-hole but I thought the book would at least be witty and have some sort of silver lining. Unfortunately, all it does it make you wish you could have your money back. It's just really sad. He genuinely seems like he's a bad person."
1,"Yes, I have been there and I do have regrets","Like Tucker I enjoyed telling my stories of binges and babes to those who wished a for a cruise down the River Vicarious (primarily young males who could capture a few of the tales for their own) but they appear so silly, so empty and useless. As I close on sixty I do wish I had spent more time in academic study, kindness and compassion. One day many years from now Tucker will look back and experience a moment of epiphany on where true happiness lies."
2,If Mel Gibson Wrote a Book...,"I'd put off reading this book for the past few years, but it's inescapable (at least in airport bookstores). It's sold over 1.5 million copies, and it's no mystery why: The entertainment factor is off-the-charts. Who doesn't want to see what goes on in the brain of a womanizing, drunken jerk? Max gets drunk and has sex with a ""fat girl""; he ""accidentally"" punches one woman in the face before impacting her colon during backdoor sex. If that sounds appealing to you, by all means, pick up a copy today. Otherwise, you might be better off listening to the latest Mel Gibson rant."
2,Not worth reading,"Think of that guy you went to college with - the one whose stories were seldom true. The stories always involved drunken shenanigans and Axe-commercial-style encounters with women. Then multiply the B.S. by a few hundred pages, and you have this book.I cannot explain why I read this. I certainly was expecting something better. The author is not a good writer; he is not a good story teller. His treatment of fellow humans appears to be that of a sociopath.I heard they are making a movie of it. That should be popular with 13-year-old virgins - just like this drivel."
2,Not for me,"While I can appreciate fratire, I did not really care for this book. I rated it with two stars as some people may appreciate the book, however it wasn't for me. In my opinion I found it to be degenerate."
2,"Narcissistic idiot's rant, saved only by occasional humor","Blah, blah, blah. There are some funny/interesting elements to this book (single women should definitely read at least half of it so they are aware that such worthless men exist in the world). But honestly, what a terrible person and the story gets so repetitive and boring that I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. He may as well have written, ""I'm Tucker Max and I'm amazing and better than any other human being"" 17,000 times over and over. Oh wait, sorry. That's exactly what he did. SNORE."
3,Funny that becomes sad,"I'm saying I like it just because it has that little bit of schoolboy humor that does make you smile. But this guy is sooooo disrespectful toward the women in the book, it just becomes sad. I hope he eventually grew up."
5,Awesome!,"This book was absolutely, without a doubt, disgusting and piggish, but I didn't stop laughing the whole time! It is hilarious and as long as you can stomach the stories and just accept that some people in this world are total a-holes, you'll be in tears!"
1,eeehh,"I had no idea what this was about when i purchased it...sad to say it got old real fast. There was nothing really to it except him bragging about how stupid, and wreckless he is."
2,I hope......,"One of the worst books I have ever read. I actually expected a book, not diary entry type reading. Not to mention, some of those ""stories"" are best left untold. If you like Crude and Crass, this is the book for you."
5,Funniest book I've read,"This book had me laughing the whole time. The stories are great, and the movie does not do this book justice. The movie tried to take a couple of the stories and put them together with the Austin story, but it failed terriblely. If you read the book, read the Austin road trip last. The story had me laughing so hard I was crying for most of it. It is more of a teen/college book, but a great book for anyone that likes to hear about crazy sex and drinking adventures."
2,Bestseller?,"I thought the book was great. Inappropriately titled and classified. Should be called something like ""Funny Urban Legends for the Modern Male"" or some such crap and classified as fiction. I give it 2 stars because it's a great collection of tall tales and it made me remember some of my own silly stories. As for his website, great job at compiling a good collection of stories that we've all heard but usually in the form of ""my cousin's best friend's brother goes to [insert school] and said [insert Tucker Max story] happened [insert time] ago."" I've been in the army 13 years and guess what, pieces of his stories I've told a decade or so ago. As for the rest of his stories, I've heard from buddies and sometimes the ones I heard before Tucker Max, were funnier. Overall, Tucker should pat himself on the back for putting together this comedic book of myths and legends."
3,Tolerable for people with thick skin,"If you are sensitive and cannot tolerate chauvinism even when it comes in a form of humor, stay away from this book. It is just going to anger you, however, if you can laugh at things that people keep behind closed doors due to taboos and confirmatory, you will have a good laugh and take this book at its value, nothing more nothing less."
4,Fun and Lighthearted,"So read the description on this book to make sure you'd like it. It is not for the easily offended. Tucker tells his stories well, is pretty witty, and definitely entertaining. Easy to pick up and put down and always good for a laugh, sometimes in pure amazement."
5,grand ole' time,"Hilarious encounters and stories involving ample idiots and alcohol. A great read, but definitely not for the sensitive types. My female friends and I all loved it! Word for the wise, you need a cynical outlook and sick sense of humor to enjoy. But if you're a slightly twisted individual as myself who has no problem laughing at other's unfortune/stupidity, you will have a field day with this quick and easy read. I may even inspire you to take down some of your own unbelievable stories."
1,It sucked,"All the hype and the good reviews of this book made me buy it. Golly, it was horrible, crude, stupid and rude. Boy, do I want my money back and the time it took to read the book!"
4,A wild lifestyle in Puritan America?,"- What an irony. But anyway, although all these drunk vomit stories can get a bit tedious at times, overall the book is not bad. Unlike similar ones about ""random romp experiences"" (e.g. ""The Game"" by Neil Strauss), this one is short and didn't tire me at all, you can breeze through it and and have lots of laughs. I guess on a more serious note, I like this book for its insights about women, which are very true and useful to keep in mind."
4,Entertaining Reading,"As much as I hate to support this guy, he is a surprisingly good writer. He recalls the types of stories that you would hear from some drunken idiot at a frat house at 4 AM, but I'm pretty sure Tucker isn't lying or embellishing his stories unlike your typical drunken frat boy. I finished this book over the course of a couple plane flights, and I was happy that I picked it up. I would recommend this book to anybody. You might not want to give it to an impressionable teenage boy who thinks he could be like Tucker (you'll see what I mean), but I really think that anyone would enjoy this book as much as I did."
2,Self absorbed,"Okay, there is some humor in the book, and it is a page turner, but really, it gets old reading about this guy. He admits right out front that he is a jerk. You read the book and in the end you admit that he is a jerk. If you want a quick, light read give it a try. If you want to save yourself a few dollars and a few hours, just accept the fact that he is a jerk."
2,Save your money.,"If you have never seen Tucker's site, this book will probably be really entertaining. If you have read his stories on his site, you have read over half of this book. [...]Also, his stories are fairly entertaining if you are college-aged or below, but adults that have led fuller lives will probably not appreciate the plot of his stories, but he does have a great writing style. Hopefully, his next book will contain original material."
1,this book sucks,"If you want to read page after page of some self inflated drunken jerk who degrades women to an all time low then you might enjoy this book. personally i thought after the first two tales of his drunkin, vomiting, screwing, that this was pretty boring."
5,"Hey, if she can't take a joke, f...","This is probably one of my favorite authors of non-contemporary non-fiction. Tucker Max could be looked up as an idol for many, but I think the point of his book/site is to get other guys to act like him... Although I think he'd get mad if someone were to steal a girl away using his own tricks..."
5,Laugh Out Loud Entertainment,"This is without a doubt the most entertaining book i have ever read. I started reading this book at 2am on a monday morning and finished at 6pm tuesday evening.....just could not stop reading it. I was even reading it at work and on more than one occassion had clients look into my office because I was laughing so loud. You will do this at least once on every page. This is definitly a must read for anyone who partied alot in college or partied alot period and even if you didnt this book is still a must read for you too.....the only down side to this book is when you finish it you will think.....ok, so where do I go from here because any future books will only be disappointing in comparison."
1,It's not the content that makes this guy an idiot,"I got about 7 pages in (a friend told me I HAD to read it) and I had to put it down. I was pretty indifferent to the stories; they didn't make me laugh or make me mad. What I couldn't handle was the way the author wrote. While it's clear this guy is proud to be an idiot, the style and grammar in which he wrote likened him to a 9th grader.I just don't know how people could stand to read something so badly written! Of course it doesn't help that the guy is a joke... but maybe that's the point?It was just stupid all the way around. If you want to read something then please find a book that makes you think, even if it's just a little bit."
2,"crude and stupid, yes. Funny? Not so much","Tucker Max admits he's a jerk but he somehow thinks recounting endless vomiting sessions, discussing the many times he's acted like a shallow, abusive pig, and relaying the details of his bodily fluid excretions is worth a book. There are a few funny bits _ the Breathalyzer one at the beginning comes to mind _ but it all gets tedious really fast. It's frat-boy trash humor by a pampered kid who thinks he's being cute or profound, or something. You want to grab this idiot by the throat, shake him and say: ""Grow up and care about someone else!"" That said, maybe the book goes down better after a few shots of Jaegermeister. Better yet, save your money for the booze."
1,It's not the misogyny; it's the boredom,"Have you ever been drunk? Have you ever done stupid things with your friends? Have you visited a strip club? Have you ever screwed over somebody? Have you ever had a stupid, lame, one-night stand?If you answered ""yes"" to any of the above, save your $16 and do not throw away precious hours of your life. It IS that boring."
1,Don't waste your time,"Just disgusting. I have to wonder if some of the stories are factually correct because they seem ""embellished"". I enjoy outrageous crazy stories but being female and human with a soul, I really can't find the way Tucker uses, mistreats, insults and disrespects women even remotely funny. Much the same way, a POW survivor might not enjoy reading ""funny"" stories from the guards. Sure they have a perspective - but it's not one we should entertain. Tucker is a misogynist. I wonder how many of these women are in therapy thanks to Tucker Max. If you like this humor I would suggest Augustin Bouroughs, or even Ozzy Osbourne's bio was great."
1,Time to grow up.,"I'm pretty disappointed after reading this book. I'm disappointed not just in the book, but also in myself for reading the whole thing. The book contains nothing more than stories of Tucker getting drunk, hooking up with girls, getting drunk, insulting people, and getting drunk. I'm sure many of us have met someone who just can't seem to mature past high school or college. That's this guy, and he thinks he's awesome because of it. Tucker Max should have stuck it out as a lawyer, because he definitely should not be writing."
4,Good Laughs,"Since I had read many of these stories on Tucker's web site, the book was a little less than it could have been, but I still enjoyed it. It's a great, mindless airplane trip read. Perhaps best of all is getting to read the ""reviews"" by people who hated the book or have a grudge against Tucker Max, as I know he thrives on that. Seriously, who writes a review three or four times because Amazone deleted their previous reviews? That's as amusing as most of the stories.Yes, they can be a bit repetative, but the stories are unfailingly funny and outrageous and are just the sort of blow-back, in your face thing that the politically correct, censored world needs. Without people like Tucker, the world would be a little more drab and I'm glad he has enough brain cells left to chronicle these stories. If you've ever gotten drunk, passed out somewhere inappropriate and enjoyed laughing about it later, this book is for you."
1,worst read ever,"After reading the first two pages I decided to stop torturing my mind with such inane, stupid and meaningless stuff. This book is a TOTAL TRASH!"
1,Are there really people like this?,The lead character is a pathetic scum bag that is only concerned with himself. I hope that there really aren't people like him...and if there are I hope I never run into them. They (all three of the guys) give guys a band name. The women that put up with guys like this only have themselves to blame.
3,Just Go To His Website,"Almost all of the stories in the book and more can be found at his website (the same as his name). I actually got this book as a gift. It is pretty funny, if you have a sense of humor. If you are offended by ""potty humor"" or think that binge drinking is an immature waste of time I doubt you will find this book funny."
2,mildy entertainng for awhile,"I hope they serve been in hell, is a mildly entertaininig book to read, i don't read very often and decided to read this on deployment, for awhile its hilarious, but only because it really brings back stupid things that you did in highschool or college. i give this a 2 star because although ive heard some stories from a third grader that are funnier, some of the stories he talks about are hilarious because i could relate to them. I read this book because i wanted to read about how big of a douche bag this guy really is, and he is a pretty big one, high iq + duke law degree doesnt mean you cant have fun, but should be smart enough to realize when your an alcoholic, this guy gets his kicks off demoralizing woman, and making fun of fat girls. I hope he writes another book on him getting his ass kicked after writing this book, that would be a winner."
2,Gets old really fast,"This book isn't worth more than a couple of brief comments. There are a couple of funny moments, but the supposed hi-jinks get really old really fast. The same old stuff you'd see in a bad teen R movie."
2,Antics of a very distrubed alcoholic,"Okay, I will admit that some stuff in this book made me laugh, however I felt guilty afterwards. As I first started reading, I hated this guy and wondered how on earth there could be people so mean and cruel. Then, I began to fell sorry for Tucker Max. He is a raging alcoholic who eventually will get himself killed because of his antics. He needs help.I must admit, I was disappointed to see so many good reviews. It shows there are more Tucker Max's out there. Scary thought. . . . ."
3,Entertaining: Not for Sensitive People,"This book was very entertaining. I would enjoy it more if I had gotten it for free. There are a lot of parts that you cringe at and hope you don't know anyone who treats people this way. Good for some laughs and a good ""cleanser"" book after you have been reading something suspenseful or serious. Wouldn't recommend it to my friends but, is is good for what it is. Good for a guy in college that you don't know what to get them."
1,Like illiterate douchy bros? This book is for you . . .,"Do you like funny stories told with wit through good writing? If so, buy Dave Hill's new book,Tasteful Nudes: ...and Other Misguided Attempts at Personal Growth and Validation. Or something by Woody Allen. Or Dick Cavett. Or maybe even Dave Barry. But--whatever you do--DON""T BUY THIS BOOK. Because Tucker Max can't write, has nothing to say and you've already heard all his stories from some guy at the office who was drunk all the way through college and still finds that fact funny.If, on the other hand, you long for days in the frat house when all your bros had cool nicknames, find vomit and bowel movements hilarious, enjoy verbally, emotionally and physically abusing most women you meet and have a large collection of Ed Hardy t-shirts, you will probably love this book."
3,I hope they serve beer in hell,"Disgusting but hysterical. Slingblade is by far the best part of this book, his drive home from the tour had me in tears."
2,Ugh. Just awful.,There is no redeeming quality about this book. It is not entertaining in any way. I suffered through 2 chapters and threw the book in the trash.
5,The book is what it is.,"This book is several stories throughout this guys late teens to mid 30's. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick read, sense of humor, and not seeking spiritual guidance. This book is meant to be fun, youthful and target audience with the ability to laugh/enjoy.I read it and in turn bought an extra copy for my 23yr old nephew."
2,Shizer,"I don't really care how much of its true. I'm sure there is, at the very least, a huge amount of exaggeration, considering the book is coming from someone who proudly calls himself an arrogant @#$hole and drunken buffoon. Would he be above making up a few more details to sell more books? Really though, the whole thing is so lame that its hard to care too much."
2,For men,"I have to say there are a few mildly funny lines in some of Max's stories, but this book is for men. I read up to the ""fat chick"" story before I decided to stop wasting my time. Unless you are into raunchy humour and old college stories, this is not for you."
3,"Funny, but not for everyone","This book was very funny to me, it was like listening to one of my best guy friends going on about his party and sex life. I hope the serve beer in hell is a great book to just pick up and read when you want to read something comical. I would not recommend this book to everyone because there are some very inappropriate things being said in the book that not everyone would enjoy. So hopefully little Johnny isn't reading this book and sharing it with his [...] friends lol, but it is a good choice of a book for kicks."
1,beer in hell,Based on the reviews I thought this book would be funny and entertaining. Wrong...this book is vulgar and hideous. I dont find it funny at all and am amazed anyone did. Dont waste your money on the book or movie. No redeeming quality at all.
3,"Great stories, horrible editing","Although the stories are some of the funniest I've ever heard or read, I found that I had to go back and reread certain sentences to understand it because the editing was so God-awful. Tucker Max should be a much more popular fixture in American society, while his editor should be beaten to death with a word processor."
1,Disgusting Is Not Funny,He's a wiseguy that would have had the sh.. kicked out of him in my day if any of his b s was true. He gives a bad name to beer! Made up stuf by a guy with a little d...
4,"Annoying, yet Entertaining","It's good. It was refreshing to read a ""balls out"", raunchy, unapologetic book about detailed sex and debauchery.It's not the most well written book I've ever read, but it's easy to read. It's not poetry, but there is a flow to it. Other than the occasional big word here and there, he writes almost like you'd expect him to talk if he were telling you these stories in person...and that's a quality I can really appreciate in a writer.He's definitely a dick. You won't agree with hardly anything he does and he will get on your nerves at times....but I dare you to put the book down. I bought it Saturday, finished it Tuesday....and I'm just an occasional reader, so that says a lot.Well worth the $13 I spent on it. Recommended for people with a dark sense of humor that doesn't offend easily.-Adam"
5,If You Read this With a Conscience YOU Won't Like It,"First off, to all those who didn't like the book because it was too college partylife, or this guy adds nothing of substance, or begin to think this brand of humor was not funny, you read a book titled ""I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell"". That said, I thought this book was incredibly funny. I couldn't contain myself most times when I was reading it. The cool part is that these were real stories. Tucker Max isn't out to be some profound author, he put this out to make some money off his own hilarity. I'd recommend anyone read this book with the frame of mind that this guy does everything a moral person is conditioned not to do. When reading you find yourself wishing you had the courage to at least go out and experience life they way Tucker Max has. Great book, fun read, and potential Bible to any guy under 30."
5,You Will Need to Take a Shower After Each Chapter,"I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell (movie tie-in): with 16 page photo insertThis is absolutely one of the most hilarious books I've ever read. Probably the first book tons of illiterate state school frat boys ever bought. Oh, I digress. The characters like SlingBlade, Credit, Hate and even Doug remind me of some of my law school buddies. Every group of running buddies has a Tucker Max in some way or fashion.You will turn pages and think you need a shower after reading the next set of shenanigans."
3,"eh, well he's a man","my boyfriend & i both read this book & he easily found it way more entertaining than me. very raunchy, disgusting, and the guy is a complete jerk, but also entertaining. but he's a guy (and probably a complete liar), and you should be able to tell by the title that this isn't going to be a ""proper"" literary classic, and if you decide to read on & are offended, that's your own fault."
5,Hands down funniest book ever,"I have never laughed so hard in my life. Tears actually rolling down my face. I told my wife to read it after I finished and I could hear her laughing all the way across the house. For the people who think that he's some terrible person who has sex with poor innocent girls, give me a break. It takes 2 to tango as they say. As my wife put it, if there weren't so many whores in the world he'd have a lot less to write about. Anyway, if you don't believe that a mere book can slam you to the floor with uncontrollable laughter, you must not have read this book. Or you're an insufferable prude"
2,D-Bag Stories,"Thus book was written by a 9 year old or at least that's about the level of the writing. I would say 90% of these stories are BS. Tucker Max has the face of Michiel Phelps and a dough boy body, I highly doubt he gets decent looking females as often as he speaks of. Daddy's $ can only buy him so much. Like I always say, we could all get laid every day if we lower our standards. I paid $5 for this book so I guess I got what I paid for. I should've bought a beer instead."
3,Book was ok,The book was okay. Had a lot of funny parts but just couldn't keep me interested more than 30 minutes at a time.
3,I hate to like it.,I really wish I could have hated this book. The writer/narrator is the worst human being on the face of the planet and he doesn't deserve to be paid for the terrible things he's done. It's full of everything I find disgusting about the male sex. But my hell it was funny.
1,Terrible,I wouldn't spend a penny on another book this guys writes. Any one that openly blasts women shouldn't be rewarded with book sales. It's downright sad!
5,Awesome,This book is freakin awesome!! So many times I was crying I was laughing so hard!! I loved the brutal honesty. Great book!!!
1,Disappointed,"I expected this book to be similar to the works of Chelsea Handler, ""My Horizontal Life"" or ""Chelsea Chelsea Bang Bang"" but I was quite disappointed. The book is a collection of stories that summarize Tucker Max's experiences. Some of them were entertaining, but for the most part I felt like Max was trying to make the stories funnier and cooler than they actually are. Quite disappointed with this purchase."
5,Hilarious,"I could not put this book down! The stories are some of the most hilarious and our of this world that I've ever heard. I thought my friends and I were crazy, but this tops our stories for sure. A must read for those who want a good laugh and to be utterly shocked by a good story or five."
5,Cried laughing.,"This book was hilarious. If your looking for a serious intellectual read OBVIOUSLY this isn't it. If you've lived life a little dangerous here or there you will find this amusing. Then there are a lot of tight wads that will be offended. The women in this book made all of their own decisions to be subjected to the treatment they got. I lived in a party town and the things that happen in this book happen frequently for the most part. He takes it a bit further. And my girlfriend was the one that got me on this book. She would be crying laughing in bed reading this and so when she was done i decided to read it also. And next thing you know I was the one crying laughing. Long story short if your favorite show was and is Leave it to Beaver, don't order this. Otherwise ENJOY!"
2,"At the most, only mildly entertaining","I was pretty disappointed with the book. It was -at the most- only mildly entertaining at some points. By the end I was pretty bored of his repetitive accounts of getting drunk and getting laid.I consider myself a pretty crass, crude kind of chick. I live with male roommates; it's rare that anything offends me and I'm a huge fan of dirty jokes. I found myself offended not so much in Tucker Max's stories, but at his huge ego and the fact that he lacked respect for anyone but himself. I just thought he was incredibly obnoxious. I could imagine him as one of those loud, drunken thirty or forty year old guys you would see sitting at the corner of a bar desperate for anyone to listen to stories about the outrageous things they used to do.This book was basically written by Tucker Max as a form of bragging rights. It's nothing more than a book of compiled drunken stories you would hear from your college mates. Nothing too original; we've all been there, done that."
2,"Sometimes funny, potty humor","Read this on vacation after my step-daughter's recommendation. Some of the stories are good but tended to get old after awhile - same story over and over again with different body excrements. It is disturbing that there are that many stupid women who would find Tucker Max attractive, especially after reading his website and wanting to be another one of his ""stories"". The most disturbing is that my 16 year old daughter picked this up and read some of it before I had a chance to see it first. But on the other hand, a good lesson for a girl to learn before going to college who won't want to be treated like the dirt Tucker thinks they are and the men/boys who idolize him."
1,Thank God I am not the only one...it sucked,"I had heard a lot of good things about this book and just the idea of the book made me excited to read it. I imagined I would be reading some of the most amazing, witty, brilliant party stories ever printed. I hate expectations...they always let me down. Most of the stories could be told by any one of us males who went to college, party, and like girls. Nothing special in this book. And as every one else has mentioned, the writing was poor. I found myself reading Tucker quotations two or three times and then realizing, ""Oh, that was suppose to be funny."" Nothing clever or witty about any of his observations or put downs. Him and his friend's call a girl who wants to be pissed on ""Princess pee pee"" Wow, that is hilarious, if your 12.How did we all get tricked into believing this book was unique or good? This lame book gives college kids every where the possibility of being authors."
1,"Self absorbed alcoholic , rinse and repeat","The plot involves an alcoholic who is convinced he is entertaining when he is drunk and verbally abusive. He has sex, rinses off and repeats. You read basically the same stuff over and over again. The tedium of his life is a quite a yawn."
2,Not at all what I expected...,"I expected a funny story, one that would keep me up because I wanted to reach the conclusion due to it being a great read. Disappointment ensued after those thoughts. This was an awful book, to say the least. It was indeed demeaning to both men and women. The thought of a man sleeping with so many women, even a few in a day, just seems so ridiculously disgusting. Each and every story was the same--Tucker gets drunk, he finds a girl, he somehow manages to sleep with the girl, and then he leaves. End of story. There were few qualities of this book that made it the least bit appealing. It was, however, like a car crash--I couldn't stop staring. Unless you enjoy tasteless prose (prose being a word which may give too much credit to this book), then don't waste your time or money."
4,"Extremely funny, slightly offensive","The book is a series of chapter-long short stories, the kind you would likely hear from a frat boy or maybe your boyfriend's single best friend (you know that a**hole). The narrative is tailored to this kind of audience as well, stylistically. The problem is, as much as I wanted to fume and be offended by the slack-jawed low-brow sexist musings of a law school graduate-gone-writer, I couldn't help but laugh out loud. The stories are funny as hell. The situations are incredulous, cringe-worthy in awkwardness, and probably inflated, but all the same they're entertaining and memorable. It certainly isn't the kind of book that deserves high-brow discourse, but it doesn't purport to be. Overall I think it's a quick light-hearted read for those days when you just feel like being dumb for a few hours of your life."
2,Not funny enough to be worthwhile,"What was I thinking? I like college stories, too, but this book is a series of the most ridiculous college stories about bodily fluids you've ever heard, mixed with some disrespect for modern grammar rules and a few spelling errors. I laughed a couple of times, but not enough to make this sad anthology of Max's ridiculous conquests worth the trouble. When Tucker sleeps with a girl with an IQ over 50 and has her proofread the story, maybe I'll read that, but I think I'm safe for a while."
2,"Seen it, read it, bored by it...","I was anticipating a laugh out loud romp through sexual awkwardness driven by alcohol or immaturity. What I found was definately immaturely and poorly written and lacking in every sense of originality. The stories were predictable and, quite frankly, something you see in every sexually comedic movie on the planet. Do not waste your money or good reading time on this over-rated book or his followup for that matter."
3,Funny book,"Great book. If you are into a good read, and some entertainment, this book will do it. This is a reminder of how some people were in college. It's funny. Well written. It's a quick read."
2,Juvenile and offensive,"I was disappointed in this book. It seems very juvenile and degrading to women. And the women participating in these ""scenarios"" are not the typical woman. What will Tucker Max find to write about as he hopefully matures? I didn't even think it was well written. Just found a few humorous, non offensive statements or excerpts...otherwise thumbs down."
4,Worth a read,"I dont really care to read. I was in AK on a business trip and a friend was dying laughing while reading a story so he had me read it. I did and, while childish, thought it was amusing. When I returned home I told a friend about it. I was ordering some items from Amazon a couple months later and asked if she wanted me to order anything for her to save shipping and she surprised me by telling me to order the books I told her about. When it came in I read it and thought most of the stories were actually quite funny. It took me 3 months to read a real 400pg book but I read this 330pg book in 4 days. I agree he is a douche and I personally couldnt act that way but it was still funny and I actually laughed out loud several times. I will say I found Slingblade to be the funnier of the characters, probably because he mirrors my own thoughts quite well. I can't guarantee women will be as amused by the stories but I would still recommend reading it for things to watch out for."
5,Wow,"Slightly degrading, but hilarious nonetheless. Laughed the whole time I read it, and afterword thanked God that my moral standards are SLIGHTLY higher than the respective author's."
5,One of the funniest books ever!,"This is one of the funniest books I've ever read!!! I would recommend it for anyone with a sense of humor who is not easily offended. If you're easily offended, don't bother because you'll just be upset."
3,good stories.... a little repetitive,"this was a good book... the only thing that i did not like is it seemed like the stories were repetitive... not hating, but all and all a decent book to read"
1,Not impressed,"I had read a few pages in the bookstore and found it funny. But when I got the book and began to read, it was just one tale after another of really disgusting and destructive behavior.Sure there are a couple amusing stories, but for the most part, not too many redeeming qualities."
1,This is horrible,"As a writer of fictional literature, I must say that Tucker Max is boring and cannot write to save his life. Duke must have lowered the bar when this guy was accepted! I cannot believe the publishing industry would even publish this crap because there are so many good writers out there that deserve the media attention that this loser is getting! If I wanted to read something shocking, original and literary, I would just open up a chuck palahniuk book and call it a day. I just can't believe that people blindly give him money for this crap and keep fueling his fire. That says a lot about how moronic our society really is!"
4,"If you dig crazy, depraved, and often times vulgar humor-then this is the book for you.",Most people would probabley find Tucker Max's antics as described in this book offensive. But if you are an a-hole like me you wil find him and his stories funny as hell. I laughed my butt off reading this book.
1,Lame,"A few chuckles, but otherwise forgettable.If you want funny, Rabelaisian humour, try Jim Goad instead.In answer to the prayer in the book's title....""I hope they serve beer in hell""....well, no Tucker, they won't. Didn't you see that sign over the entrance ""Abandon hope all ye who enter here?"" carved in flaming letters in stone by the finger of G-d no less?Most other people in college had to read that in Expository writing 1A and figured that out already. Amazing. ""Hope"" and ""Hell"" in the same sentence. Proof positive of illiteracy and a squandered education."
1,A Total Waste of Time,"Recommended by a friend that I will never again trust, I quit on this book half-way through. It is utterly pointless garbage. What is most offensive about it is that it isn't even well-written. This guy sounds like a frat-boy braggart, and his stories are no more creative than those you might overhear in a bar."
1,"Bland, boring and pathetic","Tucker Max simply reinforces the notion that what's really cool when you're 20 becomes really pathetic when you're 30. I threw this book into the trash after a hundred pages because it's nothing but anecdotes about getting drunk interspersed with stories about sex with low-class women and the occasional meditation on fast food or GI Joe toys--and I'm a party college alumnus. At least the similar behavior depicted inThe Real Animal House: The Awesomely Depraved Saga of the Fraternity That Inspired the Movieis couched by the fact it's being done by teenagers in an isolated New Hampshire college in the early 1960s.If these stories really interest you, just read them for free from his blog and save your money."
1,It Just Isn't Funny,"Maybe there is something wrong with me? In any case, if you read one story in the book, you've read them all. It's just not a funny book."
5,I wouldn't believe it without seeing it,"I knew I was going to love this book because I love Tucker's website, but sitting in my living room is, to me, the definitive proof that this book is pure greatness:My 53 year-old mother is reading the book, and laughing so hard she is crying. THIS IS MY MOM! She raised me! I cannot believe this. I didn't think anyone under 35 would like this book, and my mom especially, she blushes at curse words and doesn't think Dave Chappelle is funny, but she is sitting right here laughing at Tucker Max's book. Amazing."
3,Book,"I purchased the book at the request of my son who wanted to read it (I have not read it myself). He hasn't always been a big reader so when he asked I delivered. He loves it, spent more time reading when he got this than his whole time in high school."
5,Tucker Max is an Asshole,I met him at a bar in Wicker Park. He was dressed like a slob and had stains all over his t-shirt. Somehow we ended up sleeping together that night even though I never do that especially with guys like him. I called him a week or later and he was so drunk all he did was call me a whore and tell me the only way he would see me is if I came over with beer and promised to sleep with him again. I hate Tucker Max.
5,Taking it to the limit...,"Check your morals at the door before you delve into Tucker Max's warped reality of debauchery and you will truly savor this book for what it is: A testament to the life of a hopelessly decadent man who ---whether you choose to admit it or not--- has lived out the fantasies of your largely more inhibited average American male.While it takes no stretch of the imagination to envision how much of a potential scumbag Tucker Max could be in real life, I must applaud him for demonstrating how incredibly wild of an existance someone can lead without getting killed in the progress. Having personally met only a handful of people who have lived in the fastlane to this extent, the common denominator would certainly have to be that even if they died tomorrow, they would have lived more intense and gratifying lives than most people experience in an entire lifetime. Bravo to them."
2,Who does this fool think he is?,"A recent college graduate, I ordered the book in hopes of an easy, entertaining read. A colleague had suggested it, and said that it was written in a ""voice"" like mine. I was bored after the first three pages. Actually, maybe the first three paragraphs. I did not live a particularly crazy life during college, but felt that any of my friends could have told me much better stories that would have meant something to me because I knew the characters involved. Tucker, YOU HAD TO BE THERE. SORRY."
5,Hilarious,"I got mine in the mail yesterday. This book is hilarious.My favorite story by far is ""Everybody Has 'That' Friend."" I'm sure I'd be terrified and reduced to a bowl of melted jello by SlingBlade in real life, but damn if he doesn't make one of the best characters ever.""Welcome to every day of my life"" at that moment is one of the funniest things I've ever read. Five reads later I still lose it when I read that. I loved this story.There are problems with the book, yes, but still I can't recommend it highly enough."
5,Hilarious read,"In this book, Tucker Max gives us many stories about various events that have occurred in his extremely interesting life. Often hilarious, he draws of some of the stories available on his website, plus many new ones to entertain his readers.Sensitive readers beware: this book is not for you. Tucker's escapades may easily offend.Despite that, however, I found the entire book hilarious, laughing out load many times."
1,Disgusting,"I am of the generation which this should appeal to. And very liberal minded. Realize this is a satire (I think) but it is so vile I actually, for the first time in my life, threw a book (this one) in the garbage after I read about 20% of it. Just did not want it in my house."
2,Everyone has already said this....,"BUT this guy is a complete jerk. I know, I know. That's his thing; he says that up front. Sometimes being a jerk and writing about it can be brilliant like Charles Bukowski or David Sedaris. Other times being a jerk is just lame and not funny. That's how this dude is. It's not even that the book is offensive. I just didn't find it funny or well written."
5,Funniest book ever,Absolutely the best book I ever read. Reminds me of myself with a few select friends lol you will definitely be laughing out loud so be prepared
5,Thoughts,"I didn't know whether to laugh, cry or just straight up become a lesbian. I feel so dirty in such a good way."
5,Love it,"I had already seen the movie. I wanted to read the books. I love his books. I don't take them as a ""users guide to being a man"" or anything but these books really are quite the read and well worth it."
4,GREAT Book,Good book which is very entertaining. Hopefully someday soon Tucker will get addicted to drugs so we get some junkie stories.
1,No real story here,"This was so disappointing. There was no story - just a series of short accounts of the mean, drunk, sexcapades of the author. The only enjoyment I got out of reading this book, was hearing the author describe the variety of funny characters he met."
3,Good Beachy Read...,"This book was a good read for the beach... there were some chapters that I laughed at and made my husband read but also there were some chapters that I wish I never read. Overall an okay book not something that I would read again, defiantly not a movie that I want to see..."
1,Skip this,I dislike this book. Unfortunate bc I love Cheslsea Handler books. This book is just 2 chapters repeated over again.
2,Broken record,"This book is the ""Million Little Pieces"" of made-up college frat boy stories. Except worse because the book is repetitive, and he is a horrible writer."
3,I hope they make you read this book in hell...,Drunken frat boy scatology mixed with voracious sexual conquest..A few good laughs.Not for the squeamish!
3,Unbelievable... I mean I really could not believe the things I read.,"Tucker Max is an idiot. He is a very good writer, an educated intellectual, and a complete and utter idiot. I am sure he makes his parents real proud, and the legacy he leaves will one day come to haunt him. But for now his stories are mildly entertaining, absolutely appauling, at times laugh out loud funny, but always disgusting. Men will love this book, and women will love to hate it."
3,Hilarious and Sad,"I laughed out loud violently at several places in the book. At other parts, I felt sorry and disgusted by the way he treated people so badly, often with no cause whatsoever. I have to say, this book is original and mind-opening. I would never want to live like Tucker Max, but this book is a perfect example of how there's no one way to live your life."
2,Eh,"It's not the story but how well you tell the story that makes it funny. In the beginning Tucker Max does accomplish this but after a few pages it just becomes repetitive. Mostly everyone who went to college has their share of stories about debauchery. Take Tucker out of his area (ie with Doug in Texas) and everything definitely is out of his league. His tendency for alcohol could become very catastrophic for him in the future. As he gets older, he does become wiser. He finally figured out how some women can be just as ambitious in the sexual realm. But has slipped into being ""that"" friend. The part of SlingBlade now being played by Tucker Max"
3,The New York Times book review was correct.,"""Thoroughly entertaining and completely reprehensible,"" the Times critic had said, and that's the truth. It's like an unadulterated version of The Game."
1,Ho Hum?,"It's funny for about 5 minutes. Why a 30 year old educated man would want this book out there.....it escapes me. So much for education. Take it out of the library, if they will carry it. It's not worth the money."
1,Disgraceful,"I think this book is a disgrace to women. Tucker Max belittles them, and finds himself to be some kind of hot shot after he does whatever he wants with girls. I think he is pathetic, and needs to seriously grow up. I can find how it might be funny to some people, but it only makes it seem okay for other men to treat women this way. It's repulsive. Have fun in hell, Tucker, because it sounds like you're excited to get there."
1,So?,"I'll give this guy credit for writing something that sold millions. Other than that, not much; just one entry after another about picking up girls in bars. Gets repetitive after a while."
1,Hmmmm,"I read a few chapters of this poorly written garbage, and it's just not my thing. It can be entertaining, if you enjoy the shameless shenanigans of people that are douche to the core. Simply put; the guy is an absolute douche. I had to stop reading, because personally I can't stand guys like him and I felt my own shame in even reading a few pages of his crap. I do enjoy my vulgar humor, but only when it has tact and doesn't come from a scumbag. If you are the type to admire the d-bag frat boy ways of banging easy girls/being a jerk0ff to women, you'd probably enjoy these stories. I had to pass."
1,It's in there somewhere...,"I made it to page 32. It looked as though it might be funny in a sort of frat-boy sense. But I didn't find it funny, either because Max isn't that good a writer or because maybe frat-boy antics aren't as funny from an objective POV; a sort of ""you had to be there (and drunk)"" thing. I'm sure something funny happens eventually, but I didn't make it that far. There is a similar-looking book by another author on Amazon in which that author actually writes a long-winded (tongue-in-cheek) note to married people in the description to warn them ahead of time that his book is not meant for them. I very much appreciated that warning and I was saved the time, money and effort that I might have spent on the book. I think perhaps this book requires a similar warning, although to a much larger audience."
2,Over the Top,"Tucker Max is a self- proclaimed a**hole, and he lives up to his own assessment. Some of his tales of drunken debauchery and sex are amusing, but these themes are repeated so many times that it is almost as redundant, irritating and disgusting as it is amusing. If you like tales of drunkenness, vomiting, sexism, drunk driving, and unprotected sex, this may be the book for you. If it bothers you that a man who views women solely as sex objects and glorifies things like drunk driving can become a cult hero, save your money."
5,Wholly Crap - this guy is funny,"If you are a guy, or know a guy, then you should read this. Tucker listed out his drinking sexual conquests in painful details that left me aching from laughing so hard. I can't wait for whatever he is going to put out next?"
3,I hope they serve beer in hell,"Read a few chapters and laughed out loud. But after reading several chapters it started wearing. I guess if you are a guy, you'll appreciate it more."
5,This was awesome,I loved this book i would recommend it to everyone with a sense of humor. This book will be re-read by me over and over. for sure.
1,Yuck,The beginning was a bit funny and he gave him self away in his reaction to energy healing.What I found interesting is how in one chapter this guy brags about hurting and causing a woman bodily injury!(He's probable like a secondary rapist - that is someone who hurts someone who's been raped and thus doesn't know how to take care of herself) Then he acts like a pathetic baby when he suffers a little bit of abrasion and hurt. Okay he gets upset when he gets hurt but brags when he causes someone else pain?! I don't know about you but I think this is pretty pathetic and will not support this guy in contributing any money towards his movie and I'd burn the book. It's really gross. I don't even feel sorry for him.
1,The only book I have ever thrown out.,This book is the worst book I have ever had the misfortune of owning. The writer is crude and disgusting and enjoys abusing women. After the third story I had to remove the book from my house to feel clean again.
1,This book hurts my soul,If you still have even a slightly positive view of humanity and want to keep it that way DO NOT read this book. The idea that there are probably many more people out there like Tucker Max and his cohorts keeps me up at night. I am embarrassed that I ever paid for this book.
1,Garbage!!!,A one star rating is more than this deserves. Even the time spent writing this review is a waste of time on this book. Garbage!!!
5,Awesome,"Awesome is the only word needed to sum up this book review, I told all my guy friends to read it, they loved it."
5,The Next Great Writer,"I was in the humor section of the bookstore this weekend looking for a gift for my father when I came across Tucker Max's ""I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell."" I was unfamiliar with his work, but the catchy title and cover looked interesting enough. I started thumbing through the book and before long I was laughing so loud I was drawing attention. I haven't stopped laughing since.Mr. Max is a talented writer who has the ability to make the reader feel like they are standing next to him as the stories unfold. You may initially consider that the stories Mr. Max writes about in the book couldn't happen to anyone, but that feeling soon changes and you not only expect them to happen, you want more. This book is well written; side-splitting funny and I would and will recommend it to anyone who'll listen."
2,Gets old fast,"I read this book because a good friend of mine recommend it to me. ""You gotta read this book man!"" he said ""it's the funniest thing I've ever read!"" guided by my friend's gushing description I decided to borrow his copy. I will admit, the first handful of stories where very funny but I began to see a tend. You read a few stories you've read the whole book. It just becomes a constant cycle of ""This one time when I was drunk"" or ""This one time a slept with this chick and something weird happened"" or ""this one time my friends and I had a crazy night on the town"". As I read I had a feeling that Mr. Max may have indeed had some crazy things happen to him but doesn't take a lot of imagination to just make these stories up. He does have a need to entertain his audience. So I'm calling B.S. If you want a couple of MTV's Jackass type chuckles then this is your book. Otherwise I found it to be a waste of time."
1,Second Try,"This book has absolutely no redeeming qualities. It is a waste of time, money, and any effort spent recognizing its existence. I wrote a more detailed review yesterday, but it was promptly deleted by either Amazon or the author. As a result, this review is a little more succint and to the point. The book is worthless drivel--bottom line. I wonder how long this review stays up."
1,Not funny,"Really? A best seller? He's just a womanizer with no remorse, no apologies. What a great model for young men... save yourself time and don't read this book."
1,Seriously??,"The book is a joke. This guy was the ""cool kid"" in a school full of, lets be nice, not so cool kids and used that to his advantage when building his ""reputation"". Though slightly entertaining, I feel that the hype of the infamous Tucker Max is vastly overrated. I found his stories very repetitive. The only thing that he did was write down his stories (I'll give him that). Take this review for what it is worth.."
1,i hope they serve beer in hell,"a waste of time and money. i bought this book because the sample was quite funny and the book got good reviews. however, the content quickly deteriorated and was repulsive. it made me sick to think of the people who were mocked and mistreated by the author and his friends."
4,heheheheheh,"I thought the book was hysterical. You have to set aside the obvious and admitted ego of the author, and just take the book for what it is: an hysterical, truthful commentary. If you let any empathy sink in (which is ridiculous because they willingly entered the Tucker Max realm), you won't like the book; and I'll prejudge you as a pretentious wanna-be with a mangina that needs to remove the stick from his butt.Girls will probably not like this book at all, and I'd venture a guess that you weren't the author's target demographic."
5,I laughed until I cried,"I couldn't put this book down. I laughed until I cried. There were parts that I found a little too graphic, but it just helped create a more visual picture of the events. Much funnier than similar books by other writers."
5,awesome,This book was awesome...my husband loved it...I heard about it from a friend and I'm so glad I purchased it now all I have to do is buy the second one and the movie!
4,Fast read... Funny book,"Funny. What else to say. Great stories. As sick as it sounds, I will have my 20 something kids read this."
1,wishing for a time machine..,"Really wish I had a time machine. I'd go back in time and NOT buy this garbage. IF you like drunken frat boys engaging in homoerotic, misoginistic acts of idiototic drunken debauchery, then, by all means, this is what you want. But if that doesn't sound appealing to you, or you didn't just graduate from college and want to relieve the stupid things you did while partying, then ignore this book. Give no credence to people who recommend it. This book is a disgusting look at various sex acts that should have been left in the ""author's"" head and not written down and shared. I can't say enough bad things about this book, I wish there was a negative rating system, I wish I could delete this book from existing in my head. Failing that, I guess I can warn people about it. This is not a feel good, bad boy learns from his mistakes and makes good, just a juvenile look at bodily functions."
4,Loved it!,"I was as recommended by a friend to read this book and I must say I was not disappointed. This dude is my idol and has some hilarious stories. The only downfall in my mind is that at a point in the book, some of them got repetitive and quite disturbing. Other than that I'd recommended it to any one male or female."
5,HILARIOUS,"Read it. This book is too much. I cant wait to read his other books! strictly adult humor, 18+ seriously"
5,Richpow,Awesome book I enjoyed it and now I have to read the entire series. Tucker is a funny guy. Lots of laughs.
5,Fantastic,"Loved it! He's an ass but if you can't take joke, than eff you, right? I must get Tucker Max Drunk!!!"
1,Horrible,Dont waste your time or money. This the most fabricated book of stories that I couldnt even finish. So upset that I wasted my money.
1,Garbage,"This is the biggest piece of crap ever. How this ever became a best seller is mind boggling. Why anyone would publish it is even more mind boggling. There is some poetic justice in the fact that the movie bombed. The book is stupid, boring, disgusting, and worst of all, not funny. If you have ever listened to a pig talk about how proud he is to be a pig, you've already experienced what is in this book. Save your money."
2,Redundant.,"I won't give this two stars for the fact that the author is obviously, what he is. I do not enjoy narcissism, nor do I enjoy around 300 pages of it, unless it is making fun of it, which this book does not do. The stories themselves could have been interesting, had they varied. I found it redundant, and irritating that people actually recommended I read this. After the anal sex story, I just set it down and forgot about it. I do not recommend this book unless you enjoy reading about someone else's sex life, over, and over, and over again."
1,"Repedative, poorly written and dull","If you've ever been to a bar, gotten drunk or did something embarrassing or regrettable you've probably got a better story to tell than any that you will find in this book.Basically every short story is the same repetitive crap.Here's the formula.Egotistical jerk gets drunk, has sex with mildly retarded girl, treats people poorly then makes a fool of himself.Now Repeat the above formula 20 times and publish."
4,It's what you should expect,"Considering the title, you should expect this book to be inappropriately funny, and that's exactly what it is. I'm a girl and I do sometimes get offended by guys acting like pigs, but this was just so extreme it ended up being funny. Not a sit down and read all at once type book, but I enjoy picking it up at random times and reading another story."
5,Hilarious,I heard about this book in college from some people and decided to buy it.It was a good choice.I normally hate reading but i couldn't put this book down.It reminded me so much of me and my friends and about how funny drunken stories really are.Definitely worth buying if you are in college and enjoy binge drinking and hearing funny stories!
5,Truth,"The life you share and write about is obviously nothing new, just a little more over the top than most are ""willing"" to indulge in. The need to mock self, God, and others have always made people raise eyebrows and/or laugh a good one. Because you were uniquely made, as am I, change will likely follow at some point. Indulgence and mockery has its end. I hope you continue to be inspired to write and share your truths as you evolve as a person. Don't be mislead into believing ""hell"" will be a party. May this book be condensed into the 1st chapter of your life. Yes, there is so much more in you. BRAVO!.........rebecca"
3,Disappointing,"Because of the title, I was expecting to be laughing during the entire book. Although I chuckled a few times, I was generally bored by the writing style of listing information. I didn't know about the web site,[...] or I would have visited it and never ordered the book. I wasn't offended, just disappointed."
3,"Repulsive, plausible and actually comical","Who knew that a book about the nauseating antics of a morally reprehensible womanizer would be so engaging. Be that as it may, not recommended for anyone with ethics. On the other hand, the stories are repulsive, plausible and actually comical."
1,What was I thinking?,"I bought this book thinking it would give me a humorous look at dating behaviors from the male perspective. What I didn't realize is that this guy is a complete sociopath. Aside from a few chuckles I got from the pure absurdity of a couple of the stories, it was utterly unenjoyable.Sooner than later, this jerk is going to wake up and be a lonely old man, and college freshmen will no longer be inviting him into their dorm rooms. I think he is already about 34, so he is almost knocking on that door. What a painful loser. I am sure by then he will write a book about his long journey towards redemption to atone for the disgusting way he has lived his life thus far.I won't go into any more detail because I was totally disgusted by this book, and I want to forget that I ever read it."
1,Great if you're an a-hole frat boy,"UGGGGHHHH... I had to give up on this book after 50 pages. I thought it had the potential to be fun, but it quickly degenerates into an entry for ""The World's Most Awesome Frat Dude"" contest. If you're the kind of vinegary feminine bag that thinks that sounds remotely clever, then this pile will be great. Not for the thoughtful."
5,Haters,"Anyone who hates this book and/or Tucker Max is just jealous, because Tucker Max is easily one of the most kickass guys ever. The guy makes six figures and the number of women he's nailed is easily in the triple digits. This book is awesome for anyone who has the slightest hint of a sense of humor. Buy it now, bookmark tuckermax.com, and do your best to try and be like Tucker Max."
3,So here's something.,"Full disclosure up front: I've not read Tucker's book, am still somewhat unsure that I will, find it at least marginally interesting that Amazon served up this title as an additional one I might in fact like (how exactly does *that* algorithm work?).A few thoughts, however:1) You mean he's a jackass *and* a lawyer? Wow. Unusual.2) I can't look down my nose at the conquest of women. We've all likely had our trials there, though I'm less certain that I could celebrate it. For money.3) You know, Tucker, if they serve beer in hell it'll be hot. And I'm guessing not the name brand stuff. Unless it's Hell Brand beer. And that can't be good."
2,This book is kind of bland,"I really would expect more audacious stories from a book with such a clever title, but these stories are just so common - same old, same old college humor. I have heard all of these stories in one form or another from my overweight, working-class friends who are still stuck in their glory days, drinking beer and telling exagerated tales about the women they (allegedly) debouched. C'mon, seriously... If you're going to make up stories about your youth... and publish them in a book... for god's sake be more creative. I gave this book a shot, and after the second chapter I was pissed that the author got a royalty for writing stories that I had already heard a thousand times before. But... you have my money, Tucker, so you win. I give this book two stars because the title was cool enough to make me spend a couple bucks to buy it at the airport"
2,Total Inanity,This book is very funny for about 50 pages. Unfortunately its 300 pages long. I got through the entire thing because its like watching a train wreck. After a while Maxs sex and vomit get exposed for what they are...just plain stupid The guy cant even write...better get a decent screenwriter for the movie.
1,Awful book. But where did my first bad review go??,"Why did my bad review disappear? I'm not buying anything off Amazon again if they're censoring the reviews, that's what they're there for. This book is awful, just a bunch of half-true stories with predictable endings. It's pretty easy to think of hilarious dialogue when you have months to think about clever comebacks. I did laugh out loud at several parts of the book, but I rolled my eyes at the book's stupidity many many more times."
1,poorly written and just plain not funny,"This is in fact the third negative review I've written for this book. For some reason they keep on getting deleted. The ""writing"" consists of extremely repetitive stories about getting drunk and yada yada. I partied in college plenty but came out with better stories. I agree with another reviewer that if you haven't gotten out much you might find this amusing. Otherwise, it will just put you to sleep."
5,"hilarious and very, very witty","While Tucker Max isn't for everyone, I enjoyed his book tremendously. Crass and disgusting at times, he had me laughing hysterically from beginning to end."
5,Feeling Good,"This is a very funny book and it made me feel very nostalgic as I read it. Tucker Max is a new one on me and I bought this based on the reviews, although I'm still not getting the one that compared it to Brit writers ( Steve Horsfall, Nick Hornby)"
4,Unique funny (frat style) stories,"Hillarious. That's all I have to say. You don't have to be in College or in a frat to appreciate this type of humor, but that's all I can classify it in as of now."
5,ALL SMILES,"I am a female with three brothers and everything I read was very predictable but well said. I loved this book, especially at the gym- it made me laugh while getting in my cardio. Thanks for the reminder that most men are true douchebags. I would recommend to anyone who isn't afraid of the truth!"
3,I did laugh,"First, I will say that Tucker Max is a terrible excuse for a human being. He knows this already, and it's nothing that hasn't already been said. It's pretty sad when you have a man in his thirties hanging out at frat parties and having sex with young, impressionable college girls. Of course, this schick can only last for a couple more years at the most. Who in the hell wants to hear about a 40 year old guy trying to hit on girls half his age.With that said, the book (which I bought used) is funny. It made me laugh embarrassingly loud. So mission accomplished Mr. Max."
3,pretty funny stuff,Love the title. But the book didn't quite live up to all the hype. About a quarter of it had me laughing... as I have friends who put him to shame (scary thought) I still recommend it if you read a lot. Look forward to the movie though... could be hilarious if done right.
5,Must read for guys!,Freakin hilarious! All the same things you did and then some...written by a comedic genius...
2,hilarious,"This book has a collection of many different stories from the author. Most the stories are virtually the same. Funny, yet very immature"
5,Funny and Willing Participants,"I noticed other reviews criticize the over usage of ""dude"" and abuse of women. The language is like that of a friend telling stories at a bar, which is the whole point. The women are willing participants and even instigators. So what's the problem? Accept some responsibility already. A very funny read. Another great book isGod Is a Woman: Dating Disasters. I like that both books have all true stories, making them much funnier than books likeThe Average American Male: A Novel, although that was pretty good, too."
5,Entertaining read,"Tucker Max brings back memories from my younger yrs......This book is highly entertaing , but it appeals to a certain type of individual....I do not think i Have ever read a better book i could not put the book down. My boss is 55 and he loves the dam thing...Tucker Max Keep on writing these amazing but true stories."
1,Date Rape-spoiled child-waste of intellect!,I did not buy this book a friend gave it to me.This guy has a High IQ (law Degree from DUKE) and he's trying to be the next Johnny Knoxville/Jackass...EXCEPT his is about drunken slutty hook ups!His movie FAILED! Thank God! He's your typical Only Child needing to be the center of attention a true Narcissist!
2,run of the mill frat boy stories,"Mildly interesting frat boy type stories. I got drunk, picked up some chicks bla bla bla Yawn"
5,More laughs than a bus full of clowns on fire!,"I'm not going to waste your time writing a long-winded review here. I'm going to make it simple: If you like crude jokes, think womanizing and college alcoholism are funny, and have a penchant for buggery this is the book for you. Tucker Max is my hero."
4,LMAO!,"This is a pretty good read if you can forget about common decency and being kind to others. It is basically a collection of raunchy, outrageous stories about getting drunk and using women. That being said I will warn anyone who reads and loves the book to avoid the movie, as it is without question, the worst movie I have ever seen. Same stories, not funny (seriously, how can that happen?). The good thing is that the author was better than the director in their storytelling.Read the book, skip the movie!"
5,most people just dont get it,"after reading most of the negative reviews from people i feel the need to speak out. these women that fall prey to tucker are just the tip of the iceberg in a gender full of hypocracy, deceit, and egos that will never fully develop. this man is about showing the real world and i admire him for it. its also extreemly funny, if you find yourself disliking his books your the problem with modern society, fix yourself or dont breed."
5,i love it...need to buy a few more,the product is great. i wish the price was lower. I need to buy a few more
4,"Great Product, a little overpriced","Great product, holds DVDs AND VHS tapes...even the Disney ones in those big plastic cases. I would have given it 5 stars if it was more reasonably priced. It's beautiful and study and I couldn't find anything else that would hold the amount I needed it to hold and still fit into the narrow space of our media cabinet. So I finally gave way and spent the $ on these. I think I've seen a product similar to this at Target, however it wasn't as deep (long). I needed to maximize the space of our media cabinet so the extra length of these it worth the extra $ to me...although they are still pricey. If you shop around, you might be able to find someone to ship for free. It's been a few months since I purchased these, but I think I got free/cheap shipping. Just be sure to check the dimensions, like I said, some are shorter than others."
4,"Our Views On Mind Games, The Aging Brain and Its Health","We both read the entire book and did the exercises which are challenging and really give your brain a workout, and some of them can be done while driving. It seemed to be saying the brain needs exercise regularly to keep it healthy just as the body does, and the book contains numberless exercises. There is something in it for everyone."
5,An Outstanding Book,"This book has provided the most interesting games and exercises for practice and entertainment. It has accomplished the goal of inspiring me to continue such activities to keep my aging brain healthy. Positive results from having read it are already noticed. However, this book is more than a book of games. The chapters which involve the development, styles of learning, and processes of the brain are presented in most understandable an dmeaningful ways."
4,Excellent value/performance but slightly flawed,"Overall I'd rate these binos as a VERY good value from a price/performance perspective. Given the low price, the very strong flare/ghosting and annoying 'button hold' hassle take some shine off this product. i.e. the ""modest"" optical quality of these binos is the weakest part of the whole package. That's the tradeoff given the fairly low price! That said, these binos are light weight and the stabilization works great which make them a joy to use in the field as long as the sun angle is high or facing the subject. I would recommend these as a good inexpensive bino even with the (IMO) somewhat compromised optics."
5,Great on the open water,"I have had these binoculars for about 1 year now, and just love them. I use them on whale-watching boats off the California coast (I go about once-a-month). When water conditions are calm, these take off just enough of the shake from the boat to allow for clear viewing of marine wildlife (including seabirds).When conditions out on the water, are less than optimal, they still allow for enough shake reduction to be able to find whales. The lens clarity is superb in my opinion, I have tested some other name-brand, non-image-stabilized binoculars that cost as much if not more than what you can get here, and I don't see the quality being better."
1,ghost around main image,"i purchased the 10x30 is binoculars from amaZon 12/27/07. followed instructions for setting them up and noticed a slight ghost image surrounding the main image, more pronounced when viewing light objects against dark ones, contacted canon and was told to send them in to their repair station in NJ at the cost of $13 for insurance and shiping. when they were returned the enclosed letter said that they met factory specs but would re-adjust and clean them. the problem STILL exist, the is feature works fine but there is still a ghost image around the main one. at the price for this pair i expected to at least have a sharp image. at $13 bucks a shot to send them back only to be told that they are OK seems like a waste of money so i am writing this review in hopes it will stop someone else from wasting their money. service was fast but DID NOT resolve the problem."
4,Amazing!,"I just bought this pair of binoculars and I am already planning to get the higher-end 18x50 Canon IS. I did a considerable amount of research and compared several models (both IS and non-IS) before I bought this pair and they are just incredible. I plan to use them primarily for astronomy. The optics are excellent.pros:- Need i say more. If the budget suits you, I'd recommend the higher-end 18x50s.cons:- I think the price is still steep at ~[$] for a 10x30.The only reason I gave this a fourstars.- The IS button must be held down for the stabilizing to work. This is actually good as it stops you from hoggin' up batteries. However, if I am tracking something and I want IS, I noticed that it is very inconvenient (if not difficult) to hold the button and refocus.- There are no lens caps- Batteries Batteries Batteries...buy a charger"
4,Great!,"These binoculars work great! The image stabilization works like a charm, and the optical quality is very sharp and clear. My only beefs are that 1) there are no lens caps for the rear lenses - this seems absurd to me, and 2) the IS button is very small and centered, so you have to hold the binocs a certain way with both hands in order to press the button. Seems that it should have had a much larger button or buttons on the sides."
5,What a difference!!,"This product performed very well. I am happy with the purchase, and would recommend it.Item was quickly shipped and well packaged."
2,Major Design Flaw...Must Always Hold Stabilization Button,"Must always hold stabilization button when using the binoculars. This causes your hands to be tense, which increases your shaking. The stabilization button should have been a click on/off button. This becomes a major flaw if your looking at anything for more than a few minutes."
4,Canon image stabilizer binoculars,Performance of the viewing and stabilization is very good.This is the 3rd pair of these binoculars that I have used and the stabilizing mechanisim is what stops working.I use these as an employee of ABC sports for college football so they do get quite a bit of use - but it is also a MAJOR problem when the mechanism stops working DURING a broadcast.
4,Awesome,"I took these to the 2012 Olympics and they were awesome. I'm not too steady, so the stabilization was fabulous. A bit heavy and certainly expensive."
5,10X30 Canon Image Stabilizer binoculars,"The binoculars work great for astronomy and for bird watching, althought I am a little too shaky for them to work as well as they could. It would be nice if they had a tripod mount. I can clearly see Jupiter's moons from within the city. They come without lens caps, but I ordered the caps mentioned in another review in this group and they work perfectly ($1.00 each, Canon should supply them). If you would like to view sunspots or the transet of Venus this summer, the AstroZap Binocular glass solar filter pair 41-48mm ASZP032-1 from Hayneedle at $126.00/pair work pretty well, although they are a little ""cockeyed"" due to the construction of the binoculars. We will probably purchase another pair in the future."
5,Canon Stabilization binoculars,My husband wanted these binoculars to see birds with while enjoying nature. Since birds are flighty the binoculars with the stabilizer helps him get a good image of them without all the shake of a regular binocular. He is really enjoying this new binocular.
5,Outstanding Binoculars with stabilization!!!,I gave two of these for our sons for Christmas and they loved them. Excellent Ebayer!!!!!!
2,Binoculars nice - Canon service and case not so good,"Got these binoculars for my wife at Christmas this year so they are about 3 months old. We went on around 5 short hikes when the stitching binding the strap to the case came completely out of one side dropping the case to the ground. I emailed Canon expecting an apology and a new case. I got the apology, but it was with an explanation that the cases have NO warranty and I was out of luck. After spending over $300 on this product by a well-known company with a high reputation and owning it only 3 months, I expected better. The binoculars are nice, but what happens when the strap on your unwarranted case breaks, drops and breaks your binoculars, and you call Canon? Very poor quality cases. Right now I cannot use the binoculars because I have no case and have to figure something else out. So what good are great binoculars you cannot use?Binoculars - 5 stars; Case - 0 stars; Canon - 1 star"
3,Good performance but unable to handle marine environment,"I knew these were not waterproof, but they don't seem to have any water resistance at all. Used them for 2 summers on the boat and the IS system stopped working. They didn't get dunked in water and the optics are fine; just being the salt air apparently was bad enough. And the estimated repair cost (out of warranty) is out of line with their cost.So will try anther brand since their waterproof version is so much more expensive."
5,Excellent for the price and the capabilities,We live at the edge of a bay and do a fair amount of bird and boat watching. We've been using the binoculars for five months now and find them GREAT for that purpose. We use them constantly and the IS feature takes the annoying flutter away. We would like to get another pair for the car. Can't recommend them highly enough.
5,Steady Glasses,"I just returned from an Alaskan cruise and I am extremely happy that I purchased the Cannon 10X30 IS Binoculars.Not only were they crystal clear but provided a super steady image from a moving ship. The couple we were with tried them out and were really surprised how good they were. You could pay a whole lot more but not gain the stable images that these produce, Great Glasses!!!!!!!!"
4,Take the shake out Buck Fever,"Let's face it, no matter how many big game animals you see your heart starts thumping and your breathing is labored. That's usually when you need to decide whether it's time to shoot or pass. Another common scenario is glassing out west and trying to decide if you should make a 1/2 mile stalk while straing to get a good view of the rack.I assure you these things work. I have had mine for 4 or five years. I have two pairs of rechargable batteries. I don't think I have ever had to change fully charged batteries in the same day.Where they are noticably lacking is low light at the very beginning and end of the day. My Nikon Monarchs are much better for those 10-15 minutes and that can be a big deal. I wish they had 10 x 40's. They already weigh more than regular bino's so adding a few ounces for improved low-light viewing would make them 5 star."
4,Minor note,"Christian does a very good job of describing this album, so I just wanted to point out the one thing he missed - this is BC's second album. The first one, also eponymous, was released a couple of years ago on the Third Stone label, STONE 036CD, and is now quiet difficult to obtain."
4,Bass Communion - 'Bass Communion II' (Resurgence),"Yet,another one of Porcupine Tree's main man Steve Wilson's side projects.He's got several,so I hear,like the three releases by Incredible Expanding Mindf**k(check them out).This is my first ever listen to Bass Communion and I like what I hear. In my humble opinion,it's best described as 'ambient progressive'. Tracks that make this import title a true keeper are the spaced out ""Advert"", ""16 Second Swarm"" and the thirteen minute, atmospheric ""Wide Open Killingfield"". Also liked the bonus two-track EP, but I don't understand why they simply couldn't tag those songs onto the one CD. Good release to have,just the same. Might appeal to fans of Flower Kings, Translantic, No Man and Flying Saucer Attack."
4,PURE CRAP? NO JUST THE 1 STAR REVIEWER,"SIT AND LISTEN TO THIS CD ON HEADPHONES, LIGHTS OUT AND YES ONCE AGAIN< LISTEN!!!! MUCH MORE TO THIS ALBUM THAN MOST...VERY SUBTLE AND WILL GET LOST ON MEAT HEADS (REVIEWERS GIVING 1-2 STARS) MUST HAVE A GREAT APPRECIATION FOR WAHT IT TAKES TO MAKE THIS KIND OF MUSIC..NOISE TO THE UNTRAINED EAR...PURE MAGIC TO THE TRAINED EAR.....WASTE OF MONEY??? PAID $14 FOR MINE NEW ..NOW IN DEMAND ONLY 4 ON AMAZON NOW $19 PLUS....UTTER NONSENCE MR MEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,insufficient yeast for all recipes,"I have only tried a few recipes from this book but have had terrible luck with all of them. I have had great luck with other bread machine cook books and after scanning the recipes carefully, I have come to the conclusion that the amount of yeast on each recipe is insufficient. Each one in this book calls for 1 tsp of yeast, regardless of the size of the loaf. All other recipes I have tried, call for closer to 2 or 2 1/4 tsp per loaf. I wouldn't buy this again."
2,These bags are pathetic!!,I recently purchased these bags at a supermarket that I don't normally go to and they were the best price for the quantity. They fit fine and the kind we bought had an odor block and that was dandy too. We have used about 10 or so of the bags and about half of them have had rips and tears in them upon taking them out of the trash can. The plastic lining that you tie the bag with will constantly rip through the bag if you aren't extra careful. Tonight was the last straw when I had to double bag our trash because the bag completely ripped and there was no way to tie it. I really wish I wouldn't have bought such a big box as I will definitely stick to a different brand next time.
2,lame hefty bag,I purchased these bags from walmart and I am disapponted with the quality. (Hefty 13gal. drawsting unscented odor block 85 bags). The drawstring breaks very easily. Not near the Hefty quality I expect. If I wanted this quality I would have bought the Walmart brand. Is everyone going to this? I pay the extra money to know that I get the best. But now I think that I should go with the cheap stuff. It performs the same if not better
5,Fascinating and informative,"This handy, little book is a fascinating look at Virginia Woolf and her monumental book, ""A Room of One's Own."" This book begins with a chronology of Woolf's life, launches into a biography of her, and then looks at Woolf and her book, their world and their relationship. This is a great book, one that everyone should read. It's short and easy to understand, so it's not just for students. Do yourself a favor and buy this book!"
3,it works,It came in good time and works always but I was thinking I would have got more light from it. A little disappointed in that but its a solid performing product. I just had to buy a better flash after getting this one to take group pictures but this was fine for just people in twos or by themselves.
3,Using 380EX with my Rebel XTi,"Just brought a 380EX 2ND hand. Had some test shots with my Canon Digital Rebel XTi. After you turn on the Camera and the 380EX mounted on it, it does show the E-TTL indicator. As per my camera documentation mine is a Type-A camera. I followed all the steps in the 380EX manual as well as my XTi manual. Looks like the best results are with either Av (Aperture priority) or Tv (Shutter Priority). I think setting the Aperture as wide as you can (In Av Mode) and letting the camera choose the best shutter speed works best for me. I have tested with ISO 800. May be i am missing something, but the performance of the speedlite does not seem to be any better than the in-built flash. I struggled a lot trying to make the speedlite work in AUTO mode, No luck, It just won't sync with the shutter. May be i need to test more settings and see what i am missing.Update: Found it best fit if used as fill flash."
4,A very well written book on transformers and inductors,"This book is superbly written and covers every possible asset of transformer and inductor design (torroidal transformers included). I have used this book to design transformers for a company in South Africa with great success. Take note that this book is not written with the beginner in mind, so a good background of electromagnetism is required in order to understand some of the concepts."
5,Among the best foundational material for magnetics design.,"Wether you are an engineer, technician, or just an interested layman, this book will take you from the grass roots understanding of basic magnetics all the way through to some fairly advanced topics. Among magnetics engineers, I have found it to be one of THE BEST for properly setting up foundational knowledge and theory. Too many engineers have weak or incomplete foundations and quickly hit a plateau where they can't go further until they go back and really understand the basics. If you buy one book, buy this one. The other two books I would recommend of this caliber are no longer in print."
5,A very thorough analysis.,I would highly recommend the book. I was able to fairly quickly design a resonant inductor for a 500 watt ballast. The calculations agreed with the test test data very well.
3,Need of information search,"I have the need to find adequate information on the topic of my concern. This book is the only one during a search of more than an hour that even comes close. I believe that this book will meet my demand but, since the appetite of man is ever demanding, I do hope that the need to find adequate information on the topic of constant voltage transformers design will be met by this book.I have on earlier occasions read books by this arthor and has found them to be instructive. I have no reason to doubt this volume now. You are encouraged to continue informing technical industry.Ray"
5,"Great Binoc's for the $$$, buy these!","I was questioning the power of these binoculars prior to buying them. I wanted something lightweight enough for hiking, backpacking and birdwatching so I bought these. I am very pleased with the optics and recently compared these to a small pair of Nikon's my friend had paid double the money for, needless to say, the Canon 8x23's put his to shame. They had much better clarity at further distances, plus there was more viewable area with better lighting. Don't waste your money on other brands, Canon has done a great job with this product and I am going to buy a second pair for my wife. I would put these up against full size Binoculars any day, but not of course a $1K pair! Great buy for the money and you will be pleased."
3,Not that Impressive,"I have bought this binoculars from Amazon through a friend in States to be delivered to Singapore. I needed the bino to check if there are any available slots in the golf driving range about 400 metres from my room. : )After reading all the great comments about this piece of baby, i decided to buy it. The magnification wasn't as terrific as i thought, the distance is too far? guess i was bought by the writeups posted by the previous reviewers. I've not tried the other binoculars before, but i'm pretty convinced the other brands will do just as fine minus the higher price tag."
2,Photography Like a Pro - brief synopsis,"This book is a more-or-less well written manual; however, I must admit that a lot of the information in this book is not very well presented, and often confusing (especially if this is a first time that you are encountering the subject). More detail should have been given to differences in aparture settings, and examples were lacking. Depth-of-Field was poorly explained, and while this book starts out with something as simple as a single-use camera, about 50% into it, explanations are assuming that you are very familiar with the concepts before reading this book. I must say that if I were a true beginner, I would not benefit from this book very much at all. I am not sure if there ever will be a book that will have a smooth transition from basics to advanced techniques, and will include many examples, but this book fails completely."
3,The Lost Years,"You should read his book first, then watch the DVD. The photography is great but the background music and the monotone voice can catch you closing your eyelids once in awhile. Overall it is very interesting and covers a subject that many thought about but were never able to find anything addressing this part of his life."
5,Awesome Spiritual Journey,"This documentary combines adventure, history and an amazing spiritual journey. It answered the many questions I had about Jesus' childhood years...where he went, what he did.... all while being pursued by King Herod's soldiers. The film makes you feel like you are with Paul Perry every step of the way on this extraordinary journey. The places and things seen and heard on this DVD are truly amazing. I recommend this to EVERYONE!!!! A MUST SEE!!! This is truly.....""The Greatest Story Never Told"".....until now!!"
5,Spectacular documentary & travelogue,"Cinematography is outstanding,keeps you rivetted & makes one want to go to this fascinating country whether one has an interest in Christianity or just see spectacular Egypt...Vern"
5,jesus and his learning years,thank you for this dvd! it is creating evidence about jesus'life 2000 years ago. alsoJesus The BookorThe Lost Years of Jesus: Documentary Evidence of Jesus' 17-Year Journey to the Eastare co-creating this evidence. thank you for making his history hole and not forgotten!
1,No discounts for this set!,"FYI, I have just received this set (2/6/04). Contrary to what was stated by another reviewer, it DOES NOT PROVIDE 15% discount coupons for the associated exams! That was a temporary Microsoft promotion, which at the time of this writing applies to Windows Server 2003 exams, but not to these MCAD/MCSD tests. As far as the content of the books go, I haven't even begun to read them, but I want to make sure no one else buys them just to get the discount. Next time, check with www.microsoft.com/learning first to see what kinds of promotions are currently being offered."
3,Not in-depth enough,"This books disappoints because the coverage is not in-depth enough. When you take sample exams, there are a lot of uncovered topics. I found Que's books to be much better preparation for the MCAD exams."
2,Wrong Version - Wrong Examples,I am displeased with the fact that there was not indication that this series of books is tied to Visual Studio 2003. I am working with Visual Studio 2005 so none of the examples match the version I am working with.
2,Pretty much useless,"I think I must have read at least 3 of the books in a set (spend a chunk of my Caribbean vacation on reading those). I read very thouroughly but when it came to taking a practice test from Testking.com, I could not answer any sample questions at all. Also when reading the questions and trying to find an answer using one of the books in this set, I couldn't because a lot of important concepts are simply not there (for example Web Farms).The first exam I took was 70-305. I passed it the first time with a pretty high score. The book I used to pass and highly recommend is MCAD/MCSD Training Guide (70-305): Developing and Implementing Web Applications with Visual Basic.NET and Visual Studio.NET (Training Guide) by Mike Gunderloy. You can get a used one for under $20. It's worth every cent. Also I would like to recommentd to pair it up with sample questions from Testking.com."
1,Dont buy! Voucher is expired as of June 2004,"One of the reasons I bought this expensive set of books for the discount. Later, I found out that voucher expired on 2004. I felt cheated."
4,Essential for getting Certs,"This is essential for preparing, but don't think that everything you need to know is in this book, be sure to check out some practice tests too. These books actually make decent reference books too if you are in a pinch. Note that these are not targeting the current Certification available for VS2005."
2,"Somewhat OK for Reference, Bad for Test Preparation","I bought these thinking that Microsoft would be in the best position to write a training kit to prepare for the certification tests, since they are, after all, Microsoft tests. Big mistake. If I hadn't used the Transcender practice tests also, I would have gotten a rude awakening at the test center. The MS books have some decent reference information, but they don't prepare you for the tests."
2,What happened to quality assurance?,"I've bought all these books separately when they were not yet sold as a bundle and I can tell you that is was very frustrating do get through all the errors and typos. I definitely recommend Kalani's books instead of theses ones. Have not really had the chance to read all of the 70-300 one, and since Kalani does not have one on the subject, you can buy it separately."
2,The Truth About This Book,"Ok here is the honest truth about this book. The biggest thing wrong with it is the title. The title suggest that after reading this book you will have the knowledge and skills necessary to pass the exam. NO WAY!! Not even close. The title should be ""An Introduction to SQL Server"" because it introduces alot of the concepts on a very non detailed high level fashion. I am taking a training class at this place called techskills and had it not been for them, i would have flunked the exam. Their practice questions are very very very similar to the real exam. When taking their practice questions i had to go to server books online to figure out the answers. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK AS A STUDY GUIDE FOR THE 70-229 EXAM!!!!!!!!"
2,A wasted investment,"I'm a long-time .NET developer, since it was in Beta. I love the .NET Framework, and I wanted to get certified to grow professionally.If you are trying to pass the certs, DO NOT BUY THIS SET.The practice exams in this set are a joke- I was getting 90+ scores on the practice exams, only to find the real exams covered substantially different materials, kept a totally different time pace (these are timed exams), and were presented in substantially different style.I bought books from Microsoft Press because I didn't want to mess around with anyone else- I trusted the name. I am furious with Microsoft Press- they've cheated me. Don't let them take you."
3,"Decent Way to Learn, But Not Enough for Certification","If there's anything I've learned in my years of programming, it's that you need more than one book to achieve a Microsoft programming certification. Usually MS Press (recently affliated with/purchased by McGraw Hill) books are the gospel, but their theory goes much further than their hands-on, which is far from extensive. In the past I have used Sybex's books, which have much better hands-on examples, allowing you to explore all of the features of the environment.These books are very helpful to me, but I certified in VB5 and 6, and have been working with .NET since Beta 1. These books will not be helpful to someone who is ""new"" to Visual Studio languages, or new to programming altogether.If this is your first MS programming cert, be sure to pick up other books as well to ensure you cover the breadth of material necessary."
1,garbage,This hard drive worked well for about a month of light use. Over time it began to give me more and more problems with transferring data and then it stopped being recognized by windows periodically.Now the disk sounds like it is having trouble spinning and it takes approximately 10 minutes (if at all) to show up in windows after plugging it in.Not at all recommended.
4,Great book! Too short.,"I really like this book. I didn't have any problem following the story as some others remarked. My only criticsm is that the book is too short. Whole parts of the book are just not fleshed out enough. The story was great, the action was great and the characters were good. I'm looking forward to Anderson's next novel."
5,Sleeper Cell,"Sleeper Cell is a gripping page turner. This author has done his homework and is able to present a plausible scenerio that will make you ponder the viability of biological warfare via nanotechnology. No matter what genre you typically read, you will enjoy this book. Cheers"
3,Confusing,"This thriller is all about bio-terrorism/the spread of deadly virus.The premise of this book is actually quite good. A cell introduces a viral infection to the USA. The USA sends their best scientists to try to contain it.The overall problem with this book is that, unfortunately, there are so many characters introduced to us that we actually need a scorecard to keep track of them all.This removes alot from the main storyline since on top of having to figure out all the medical jargon, you have to keep track of who is doing what and why.Too confusing."
3,Interesting but forgettable,"The premise of this bio-thriller is interesting: an elite group of eclectic and brillant minds lead a government group created to think about new and terrible ways the United States can be bio-attacked and come up with ways to beat those attackes. War games against bio-terrorists.Again, the container for a good story is there, and the read does move along well and there are some interesting questions that are introduced, especially for our government minders to consider if a bio-attack does occur.The characters are set up to be very interesting and deep, but those characterizations never occur.If you need a book for the plane (where I seem to read all these sorts of books - and the sneezer passengers around me start to make me think...) trip or the pool or beach, this will fit the bill. If you really are into bio-thrillers, then give this book a quick read and you will find some interesting bits scattered in the pages."
3,"Great Idea, not so great execution","This book sounded like an exciting medical/techno/thriller and it was. The problem I had with it was how confusing it was to try and keep track of who was who and what their role in the story was. The techno/medical terminology was a tad challenging, but not impossible. The story was all too frightening considering what is happening in the world today.This book gave the reader alot to think about and was more thought provoking than entertaining. Keep that in mind before you buy it. Overall, it was a good book and I don't regret reading it, but I would prefer Robin Cook, Tess Gerritsen, Michael Crichton, or Peter Clement. These authors can put together suspense/mystery/medical thrillers that are enjoyable and easy to understand."
3,Healthy but poor taste,"I have had the chocolate spirutein many times. I blend it with either soy or rice milk and add a dash of chocolate baking powder and banana.I've never cared for the taste of this brand. Warning: you really need a blender or you are stuck with nasty lumps of the stuff, as it doesn't mix as well as other protein powders.I currently use a protein powder from a different manufacturer which I like much better than Spirutein but which has a high sugar content and cholesterol. If your main concern is health then go with Spirutein, but if you don't think you'll be able to drink it if the taste is boring then don't bother. I would never buy a full jar of this stuff as it would just sit on my shelf mostly unused; the taste is not something to look forward to."
5,Great for weight loss!,"I just received this item and I have been using for one week as a lunch/meal substitute. And I can already tell you I have lost weight 2 lbs.! It tastes great and keeps me going until dinner. I highly recommend products from Nature's Plus including ""Source of Life"" multivitamins. They are great for increasing energy and of course their health benefits are endless...."
4,Love the chocolate one,"I've tried a couple and the chocolate is definitely the best. While sweet, it's not as sweet tasting as all of the others, while still tasting like chocolate with great vitamins! Recommended."
4,Tastes great!,"I'm always iffy about trying protein powders, but based on recommendations I decided to buy the Chocolate Spiru-Tein. It tastes wonderful! I mean, don't get me wrong, it's still a powder so it's slightly chalky. But it really does taste like chocolate! I mixed it with soy milk, PB2, and banana and it made a great smoothie!"
4,Chocolate flavor is the best,"I've tried the vanilla flavor, chai latte, chocolate and peanut butter, cookies n' cream... this chocolate is the one I like best of all flavors! I like my shakes to taste like a milk shake so instead of just water I use plain organic almond milk (for a better treat try the vanilla flavored almond milk). Other than that, best protein product I've tried in a long time and it has no fat (if you add almond milk not so much fat and it's the good fat!) no cholesterol, low in carbs."
1,Bleah! Yuck.,"Not that any of these shakes taste great, but this is just nasty. They say it 'dissolves instantly'... I'm not sure how they define instantly because I put it in their shaker with skim milk and shook for nearly five minutes and it was still chunky. It was gross to start with, but with chunks it made me gag."
2,Not that good,In my opinion this protein powder is not very good for a chocolate mix. I have definitely had better.
5,"great product, terrible vendor","I have been ordering this product for years, mainly thru Amazon. This was the first time I had a problem. Vitamin Life took 14 days to ship a package and when I complained it hadn't arrived they sent back an automated response. I wrote customer service again to complain with no repsonse. Will never again use this company. too many other great companies offering the same item."
2,Not a fan,"Ugh,! If I could get over the taste and consistency/texture of this stuff I might be able to find a lot good about it, but it's just plain hard to swallow. It's a pain to get it actually mixed smooth (unless you carry your blender with you). It might be a good product, but I'm not going to fight with this stuff every time I need a protein drink. So I'll choke my way through the rest of this container because I don't want to waste it, but I won't be buying it again."
4,Tons of energy,"Mixes very well with skim milk, but will need a shaker bottle with any other type of milk. I like mine with vanilla almond milk. Skim milk is too plain and the taste does not appeal to me."
5,Great!,"I bought these for my dad, and he loved them. They are beautiful with a classic look. The shipping was amazingly fast with no difficulties."
5,Making War Horse---A Captivating DVD,"The DVD, Making War Horse, is just great! This DVD shows what was necessary in making and working with the life size horse puppets appearing in the play. Those involved with the puppets learned---from Monty Roberts, of 'The Man Who Listens To Horses' fame---everything they needed to know about equine behavior. Then they went into action. As a result, the puppets act more like horses than horses do! One of those who works with the puppets said that they have the puppets move around---and even act up---more than actual horses generally would, so that the full idea of horses can come across to the audience. The action definitely adds interest to the play itself, of which a few short scenes are shown.Anyone who has seen or heard of the play, would surely love watching this DVD."
5,Excellent film. I loved it.,This doc about the making of the play War Horse is intriguing in it's detailed revelations. The techniques developed to construct and move the horse puppets are revolutionary. Fascinating from beginning to end.
3,Condensed Version,"This is a small format, condensed version of Illustrators Reference Manual by Peter Hince. If you have that book, you don't need this one."
3,Nice read,it's a book about their zodic signs and they just talk about where they come from and what they should do.
4,PRETTY GOOD WESTERN!!!!,"Gary McCarthy has written another pretty good western. It is a little slow in places, in my openion, that is why a 4 star instead of 5. It is the story of Glen Collins, an honest, hardworking blacksmith who is running for sheriff so he will be making enough money to ask Maria Silvas to marry him. Glen nearly get killed by the other person running for sheriff, Chase Lawson. But he is befriended by Roy Whitlow who saves his life. Roy then decides to run for sheriff and also ask Maria to marry him. There is quite a bit of action. The ending is very good. A quick read as the book is not all that long. If you like a fair western with the underdog winning. You will like this."
5,dil chanta hai,"Aamir Khan is the darling of Indian film for a reason, he is a wonderful actor with charisma and loads of talent. This movie is very sweet and he, as always makes it worth watching. I wish he would give America a chance and make a movie in conjunction with some of our best. This movie is delightful. It shows how friendship may bend, but if it is true friendship it will never break."
3,"Kohler Purist 24"" Towel Bar","Nice, simple ""zen-like"" design, but way over priced. I really don't know why it is so expensive. We chose this product line because it goes with our other fixture purchases. 4 stars for design, 1 star for price."
1,Don't Even Get What You Pay For...,"I picked up this and was horribly disgusted with the quality of the items. The sweatshirts are incredibly thin, so do not expect to wear these anywhere its cold. Also, the t-shirts have a very large neck on them, which makes them look kinda silly in my opinion. For $20 or whatever I paid for them, I still feel ripped off."
3,nice budget sweatshirt,"I ended up with a green sweatshirt (the picture was gray) since they send you the ""Multi"" colour and you do not have a choice.For the price, very good! A word of caution if you are allergic or have perspiration problems, do not buy it: the fabric is not 100% cotton."
4,A very personal autobiography,"Marsha Mason has always been one of my favorite actresses, mostly because she's a very likable and earnest person and it shows in her work. ""Journey: A Personal Odyssey"" is no exception. This is more a memoir about recovery after growing up in a dysfunctional family rather than a Hollywood autobiography. The dynamics of her relationship with ex-husband Neil Simon are particulary interesting. Mason is very forthright about herself and I can recommend this book. The only drawback is that her use of her ""other personalities"" gets to be a little annoying and confusing but overall this was a good read."
4,Kenny Chesney does it again,"Kenny Chesney is a great singer and this album is no exception. The songs are a mix of traditional and originals. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was that almost all the songs had a tropical feel to them, which took from the traditionalism that is Christmas. Kenny mentioned this on the album cover and who could blame him for preferring sand and sun to snow and ice, but for me that is part of what it is all about. Regardless, I still love Kenny and his music and this album is worth adding to your holiday collection."
3,"Good, but not great","Kenny Chesney jumps into the Christmas CD market with All I Want for Christmas is a Real Good Tan. By far the best song on this CD is ""Pretty Paper"" with Willie Nelson, it is simple and they sound good together. ""Merry Christmas From Dixie"" with Randy Owen from Alabama and ""I'll be Home for Christmas""(my favorite holiday song) are also pretty good, but beyond those three, this CD is a monument to mediocrity. ""Jingle Bells"" should have been called ""Steel Drums"", they are overpowering. The traditional ""Oh Little Town of Bethlehem"" and ""Silent Night"" were not meant to have the island vibe infused. And what is with the synth work on ""Silver Bells""? He should have remade his novelty hit song as ""She Thinks My Sleigh is Sexy"". This CD tries to be laid back but comes out overpolished."
3,Gift for my mom,"I bought this for my mom, she is a huge Kenny Chesney Fan. She has not had any complaints, she likes it. This was one of the only CD's that she did not have from this artist. It came pretty fast, so it was a nice surprise for her. I recommend that if you want this CD, to get it online, we looked for it for a few months at various retail and music stores, only saw it once at Target around Christmas Time."
3,Repeat of 'This is Karate',"This is a nice introduction to Shotokan, excuse me, kyoshinkan. The author just reproduced a book he published one year prior 'This is Karate'. Now that was a great book."
4,Kick-*** Florida band that blows doors off most modern rock!,"These guys played in C. Fla during the mid-80's and put on one-hell-of-a-show! Jackies So Bad is good, but Swamp Woman Kicks!!!!!"
3,Long Forgotten,"I remember watching this 80's compilation of 'wanna' be rock stars in small night clubs when they were formerly known as ""Romeo"". It was central Florida, mid 1982, and the album is a testament to what record label rock scouts were prowling for during that era.Permed hair, wailing lead solos, and catchy riffs, Stranger was poised for stardom with this effort. Unfortunately, they fell silently to the depths of a rock and roll ocean that swallowed them up into obscurity. It may have been a saturated market or a case of bad management; who knows? Yet one legacy still shines through the abyss; Stranger's debut album is a testament to the sea of eighties youth that reached desperately for the pinnacle of rebellious success only to come crashing back to reality in a state of frustration and broken dreams.Fixed in time and forever dated by a tumultuous yet exciting time for rock musicians, Stranger is one for reflection.Brad Zimmerman"
1,not worth it,"this is a useless product.only makes formula,food room tempature.you could warm formula,food just as well if you put it between your legs for 10-15 minutes."
1,I don't like it anymore.,"Years ago I loved the Spiru-Tein, vanilla flavor. It had a wonderful flavor, color, and consistency. It was thick, creamy and smooth. Then they changed for formulation. Now it is green, chalky, thin, and watery. It is disgusting. I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,Thick and smooth,"So I bought Spiru-tein because I'm looking for a DAIRY FREE protein shake that will be quick and easy to make for those days that I have to rush out the door to go to work. I was excited when this arrived at my door and instantly tried it with coconut milk. To my surprise it turned green! lol Not so yummy looking, but I thought, ""It must taste better than it looks."" So I tried it and uuuggghh! It tasted nasty, and I swore to never buy it again! However, I thought that if I mix in some stuff it might numb out that veggie type taste. The next day I used a cup of coconut milk, a scoop of Spiru-tein, one banana, a tblsp of peanut butter, a handful of raw oatmeal, and two tblsp of ground flaxseeds. I put it all in a blender and voila! It came out so creamy and thick, like a smoothie, and it tasted wonderful! Like breakfast! I just might purchase this product again. Try it, but only if you're willing to mix in some fresh ingredients."
1,Intolerable!,I agree with comments about how bad this product is. I made this as a meal replacement and found it tasted awful! It tasted like groud up chalk--I had three swallows and then threw it up. Get this off the shelves. I would not but this again !
5,Spiru-Tein is the best!!!,My husband and I have one drink of Nature's Plus every morning and sometimes at lunch or for dinner.We started out with Vanilla. I add a handful of instant oatmeal- 2 baby carrots- a spoonful of peanut butter- 5 ice cubes- 1 cup 1% milk and you're hooked!The ice cubes make it like a real shake.I have a Vita Mix and that realy makes it blend well. I blend for 30 seconds.My husband uses the Vanilla with 1 cup of 1% milk - 4 TBS of Ovaltine - a handful of oatmeal- a spoonful of peanut butter- 5 ice cubes- blend for 30 seconds and I don't have to cook!I like the Strawberry. I take a cup of milk (1%)- 6 frozen strawberries- a handful of instant oatmeal- 2 baby carrots - and 4 ice cubes. Havenly and very satisfying and losing weight to boot!
3,Doesn't taste very good,This product was recommended by a Dr. so I thought I would give it a try. I bought the vanilla flavor. I started out making smoothies with it and in a smoothie with fruit it tasted fine. But one day I tried it with just ice and milk and boy does it not taste very good. It is very filling and does keep you feeling full for a good long while but I think next time I buy a protein powder I will go with something that has a better flavor.
5,Great meal replacement,I use this to replace dinner when I am counting calories ..... it keeps me from desperately attacking the refrigerator at 10pm. It works great with skim milk or water or whatever other type of liquid you enjoy. Chocolate or Vanilla are my favorites
5,A great way to start the day with a high-protein drink.,"Spiru-Tein High Protein Energy Meal comes in many flavors, although the vanilla is my favaorite and a good one to start with. It may seem expensive, but there are about 32 servings per 2.4 lb. cannister, so that's less than a buck a serving at current prices. The directions say to mix it with 8 oz. of milk, but I recommend 10 or 12 oz. as it may be a little thick for some tastes. Note that Spiru-Tein does NOT mix instantly as the label claims. The best way to prepare Spiru-Tein is to use an inexpensive electric immersion blender. You can get a good one from Amazon for well under $30. Try the Kaloric. One other note: Spiru-Tein contains added vitamins and minerals that are more-or-less equivalent to a multivitamin pill. You many want to check the ingredients on Spiru-Tein's web page if you have any sensitivites to same or to soy protein."
1,Did not care for!,"First time I tried this & after reading some good reviews thought I would. It taste very chalky, doesnt mix well & turns green! Also doesnt fill me up or help my appetite at all. Thought it would be a good inbetween meals drink. I have about half of it left & plan on throwing it out! Taste is bad!"
5,Great taste & benefits,This is a great product for anyone looking for either a meal replacement or for a high protein snack. I mix it with orange juice and a few ice cubes in a blender and it tastes like a smoothie.
1,Undigestable!,"I bought this based on all the glowing recommendations but I just could not digest it. After a week or so of using it daily (only 1 shake a day) it gave me horrible gas and constipation that went away after I stopped using it. I often make shakes from other protein powders and never had a problem. Not for me.PS- it does have a greenish tinge to it and as for taste, it is ok (not great) in milk, but totally gross in just water."
4,Just started using,"Tastes better than I expected; kind of reminds me of cake batter. I mix it up with a ripe bananna and it's very tasty for breakfast. Too soon to know if it will help with weight loss, but it does leave me feeling full, and good energy level."
5,BEST protein shake!!!,"This stuff is simply amazing! I haven't been using it that long so can't say what it does for weight loss but I'm hopeful by reading other reviews. I got strawberry and in a blender I add 1 scoop with 8 ounces of unsweetened almond milk ( mix is plenty sweet) maybe 2 ounces of coconut water, 1 banana, handful of ice and sometimes a tbsp of flaxseed oil for the omegas and VOILA, it's the yummiest most good for you shake ever! I always have bloating and gastro problems from other brands, like muscle milk but not Spirutein. I absolutely love that it's gluten free and non GMO soy. I can't begin to list off all the supplements but boy oh boy I love this stuff. I usually just have a shake for breakfast but may add one for dinner to help shed some pounds. I also bought mine at Sprouts and it was on sale for $19.99."
5,Awesome!,"Tastes great, and really good ingredients! Who could ask for more! For a really special treat, add some malt. YUM!"
3,50/50,"This is just an average album with two boleros. ""Suena La Quija"" is a very good guaracha that is one of only three likable songs. ""Maruga"" is enjoyable although really nothing special. The album overall isn't bad, just uninspiring. On occasions Nestor's voice doesn't seem to blend well with salsa and sometimes he seems perfect for the role. I really think he's better fit for boleros.The only one shining moment for me is the song ""Quiero Verte Otra Vez."" This song totally rips into gear after about 1:20 into it and really reminds me of the music Larry made with Ismael Miranda in his heyday. Absolutely fantastic music with a beautiful, but short conga solo and the lyrics are really great (as the title suggests, he yearns to see that special someone once again.)Unfortunately one song doesn't make an album so I'm going to have to give this one a leveled rating."
5,Romantic Latin music at its very best. Period!,"Los Panchos, Los Tres Diamantes and Los Tres Reyes were the three most important and influential trios of the bolero era and their music remains as relevant today as it was when first recorded. These songs are truly timeless and anyone who has ever fallen in or out of love will be able to relate to, savor and appreciate this great music."
5,Best of Europe (6 pc),"Amazing scenery and commentary. Makes me want to go - over and over again. Very reasonable cost and, of course, Amazon quality."
1,alcoholics anonymous beware,Rudy is a shameless drunk. He ruined all videos by showing alcohol freely flowing a thousand times.To him Europe revolves around drunk people. What a waste of money and time. I want my money back.His efforts to self promote himself and his daughter are shameless acts and at my cost. Stay away as there is more alcohol in these videos than you may have ever seen.
4,Verry nice- and Musical,This is a charming way to look at the mythology story Pegasus- I really enjoyed it-- though it was a sad story-- it was verry good! and Mia Farrow has a wonderful singing and talking voice. The animation is simply beautiful- and the story line is captivating! I reccomend!
2,Not impressed at all,"Thi was more an amateur video. there is way too much time with random scenes that even though are things people who never did Kona might have not seen, in my opinion don't add a lot of informational value.There are very little shots of the actual race and whatever you see is from the stan where the fans are at.Not worth spending the time on this video."
3,Will only be interesting to Ironman athletes,"The production is a bit rough in places. Overall the video was entertaining enough to keep me occupied while doing a trainer workout, but I wouldn't recommend it for the average viewer."
3,Another publicity stunt for McCormack,"Blah Blah Blah Chris McCormack. I did enjoy the women's journey though, and it's an okay movie. Great for a day on the bike trainer."
3,The Book Was Ok,This book does not really go into depth like I thought it would. It made for really easy reading though.
2,Vixen = Prostitution,"While I do feel for Karrine considering the severe emotional and physical abuse she has endured throughout her life, I think the book was a tad shallow. As a reader, I thought the book glorified her partying and sexually irresponsible ways. She basically was a prostitue, looking to grift from whomever possible. Sad that so many people took advantage of her."
1,What a waste?,"I am so glad I borrowed this book and didn't read it. I read the book in one day. It is a page turner because you think you are eventually going to get to some detail, wrong. If you have heard about the men you have slept with then you have read the book. The most interesting part of her book was her upbringing. The rest of the book was the same scenario repeated with different men; sex, drugs, alcohol and then they leave. I don't know why she didn't get the hint.I find it hard to believe that she has learned from her mistakes since her last dumb attack was in 2004 with usher."
2,COMPLETE AND UTTER GARBAGE and here is why...,"Do not buy this book! Save your money and check out the audio version from a library. Steffan's writing is horrible! Here is an example, ""...as I took rapid swallows it burned my esophagus."" Her sporadic $3 words dropped in two cent paragraphs are comical. She is not a good writer and can only pave that path if she read more books to acquaint herself with how good stories flow seamlessly. However, if you are interested in the ""hot gossip"" of who slept with whom and how she insinuates that P. Diddy is gay then waste your time (as I did mine) with hearing HER read HER story. Yes, she reads the audio version! Steffan's voice inflections are orchestrated pitches on the misplaced $3 words. She is unable to demonstrate intriguing vocal valleys that pull the reader into the story. NY Times bestseller, HA! I REPEAT, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND UTILIZE THE LIBRARY'S COPY."
3,Only Good For Gossip,"I think that this was a poorly written book. It started to get on my nerves when in the second half of the book she would refer to other relationships she'd had years before, but wouldn't go into detail. So why didn't she talk about it in the first half of the book! I wanna kno! Lol. Also, she tends to skip in and out of the timeline she's supposed to follow, and repeats a lot of stuff, which might stump you for a minute. What I did love about this book is knowin people's business. Some artist that I used to like are now on my bad side, but i'ts still interesting to hear about how they really are. She also seems as though she didn't learn anything from her actions. She says she did everything for her son, but I dont think she was thinking about her son while she was popping XTC pills and having 3-somes. I won't get into it too much, but basiclly, buy the book. Just to be nosey, buy the book."
2,Just my opinion/review,"I honestly went into reading this book with low expectations, seeing that most of these ""tell-all"" books usually don't tell everything you want to know, kind of like Magic Johnson's autobiography. But after hearing all of the preliminary reviews about this book, I thought it would be different.What suprised me about this book was that I found myself very interested about her early life. This seemed to be the most genuine part of the book. Everything else seemed to glorify her very dangerous lifestyle.I would have given this book 3 stars, but I gave it two because of the format in which it is written. I felt like I was reading one of those required 8th grade English class novels. I have seen comic books that were tougher reads than this book. As far as overall content and substance, it was just an average book to me. No big woop."
5,I loved this book,"I absolutely loved this book. I have to admit that I was hesitant about purchasing this book because of all of the negativity that I have heard about Karinne Steffan, but I am glad I read this. She is no different than many other woman in society today. Her story is encouraging and reassures us that it it doesn't matter where you come from but where you are going. So many girls and women strive to have the lifestyle, fame, and money that being a hip hop chick brings, but Karrine shows us the downside to it all. I have much respect for her after reading this book and hope she continues on her road of accomplishments."
1,"What did I learn about ""superhead""?","1)not only is she a whore..SHE'S A STUPID WHORE.And2) if the head was that ""super"" some dumb dude would have stuck with her.Seriously this was THEE biggest waste of time and money."
3,Not all what people cracked it up to be!,"First off, I believe she was lying about a lot things in this book to make herself look just a little better! A whore is a whore plain and simple. She slept with best friends, cousins, brothers you name it she did it! Although I do give her credit for being brave enough to put it all out there. I just HATE THAT she DEDICATED this book to her son; that was so embarrassing, dumb and motherless!"
2,Highly Overrated...,"The book in my opinion was ""OK"". With all the media hype that surrounded this ""so-called"" controversial book, I expected alot more than what I read. If you're still interested in purchasing, I suggest you borrow the book instead."
2,not what i thought it would be,"The first few chapters of the book made it seems as if it was going to be a good read. The further I got along, it seems as if the storying was repeating itself. It became a real bore. I kept reading hoping that it would get better, but it did not. Save your time and money."
4,Nasty,This was a pretty good book. This book tells you about the bad side of being a video girl. She did what ever she could and slept with anyone to get what she wanted. She isnt the only video girl out there doing this type of thing. All the drama of this book kept me constantly ready.
3,I'm not impressed,This women is not someone you want to look up to. She was a tramp then and she is a tramp now. She blames everything and everybody else for the bad choices she made and I get the feeling she hasn't changed. She's broke now so she's telling what she knows or what she thinks people will beleive so she can't eat. I feel sorry for her son since she claims that everything she did - she did for him. I guess the pill popping was done for him too. Good (maybe made up story) but not great read. It's smut that you would read when you have nothing else to do - it's entertaining if you like smut.
2,What the @*?!,"It's a ""true"" story...ok It's sad...ok The only person I have pity for in this book is her son{poor baby}Anyhow DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!!! If you feel like you just gotta check it out borrow this book from a friend trust me!"
5,READ IT!!,"I loved this book. I could not put it down. I was finished in one weekend. Her story will amaze you. I'm so proud that she was about to put her pride aside and tell her story. I respect the fact that she did not release ""some"" information. I found that very classy. I love her now. I wish her all the best."
4,Desparate Housewives Envy Video Vixens,Video girls - the secret envy of housewives who long to have the perfect body of their own youth and the sexual boldness and confidence to move their bodies and sway their hips as naturally as hip-hop video girls. This book is a poignant reminder that a woman who is a video vixen is nothing to be envious of.
1,BAD,This book is so poorly written that it's disgraceful. I believe that the only people who believe this is a good book are people who probably don't normally read. It's like a really bad journal that some how got published. The topics are unclear and inconclusive. The book is clearly for attention and to ruin lives. People make their own decisions. Being a ho was hers.
2,Boo!,"This book was nothing more than an overly long, poorly written magazine article. She drops names all over the place and selectively ""forgets"" or ""can't remember"" things that to me were crucial to how she became who she is. I found myself spending more time trying to figure out who the mysterious ""Papa"" is, and why she chose to hide his identity while spilling details on everyone else. I didn't really enjoy the book, and I finished it in under two hours. I also find it insulting that she considers this book a ""cautionary tale"" and says she wrote it to ""free herself"" and ""help others"". If this is the case, why name drop? Why not cloak all the identities?In all, two thumbs down."
2,Disappointing,"Well for starters, I picked up this book after reading an interview that Ms. Steffans did with VIBE magazine last year. I had expected this book to talk solely about Ms. Steffans and her perspective of her life as a ""Video Vixen"" (aka Video Ho)but my expectations weren't fulfilled. The most disappointing aspect of this book was that Ms. Steffans just seemed to be ""throwing dirt"" around about a lot of people with big names. I thought it was very tasteless and tacky to highlight a few ""big"" names and then to cower and leave out everyone saying that the ones she left out were still her friends. I almost laughed aloud when I read that statment. But, to top of all of the mud slinging, the book was very poorly written. I'm not sure how this book got throught the publisher. There were many typos and fragments throughout the book. If you have nothing better to do I would suggest renting this book from the local library, but rest asure that you won't read it again."
3,Confessed and Confused,Our book club read this book for our January 2006 selection and we were not really that impressed with the book. After a while all of the chapters start to sound alike.There are many contradictions through out the book and you never really get a sense of why Karrine did the things she did or if she every really resolved any of her issues.The book is only interesting because you know the stars in the book and you want to know how they are connected to her and what dirt she has on them. Other than that it was just ok.We would recommended you not pay full price of $24.95 it was not that good.Sistahs of Ebony Pages Book Club
4,Interesting Read,"This was an interesting book. It gives info about alot of music industry people. It is strictly for someone that is not into real literary value reading. This is more tell-all type material that still does not tell all. Some people have been saved by not being revealed, whereas, others are totally on front. It is definitely an entertaing, page-turner."
4,"Hot, Hot, Hot","Fascinating. The gritty real-life story of ""SuperHead"". A quick and entertaining read. Makes you wonder how many other ""video-girls"" like Korrine Steffans is out there."
3,"Expectations high, not completely satisfied","With all the hype I heard, my expectations were soaring and I couldn't wait to get this book. It was okay (I read it two days!) but for some reason I wasn't satisfied. She talked more about her relationship with Ja Rule than any other and I was expecting to get the low down on others"
3,50/50 Half/Half 2.5/5.0 Review...Because there's always two sides to every story.,"Whatever the reason for writing this book...Karrine, God knows your heart. For everybody else, all we can do is pray."
2,Damn shame,"I have to give it to Karrine for enticing people to go out and purchase this easy to read 5th grade level essays put together to form a book. Karrine is a hoe. If she wanted to inform girls out there who aspire to be video girls then why were the names and places and secrets of these industry men put into the story. She could have easily told the same story without ever saying their names. She wanted to exploit them so she could feel better about her ho-ing. She LOVED every man that touched her. And the sad part is that if she is willing to write a book about laying on her back to get where she is, then she is willing to exploit or do whatever to keep her lucrative lifestyle afloat. I did not like the book it took me forever to read it because every page was a disappointment. She never revealed who Papa was but revealed the major players so we would go out and buy this worthless book."
2,"interesting,sad&Manipulative","Karrine Steffans has a Sad story to share along with being interesting,but in the end it has alot of Maniplative elements at work here as well. the Names in all forms of Entertainment are what sell the Book.Steffans is seen as a Sad figure but I don't ever feel sorry for her.I feel sad for Her childhood,but certain things that she allowed to go down don't bring any Sympathy from me.Hit&Miss Book."
2,Whistleblower!!!,"Karrine Steffans was really in need of some money because all of her wells ran dry so she put out and hater novel. Why did she have to name certain names of men, they do have families and images to protect. What goes on in the dark should stay in the dark. She has no regards to these mens images just because she does not care about hers, does not mean she had to bring everybody down with her. If she was a changed woman, why was she on a cable channel doing an interview saying that she still had alot of different men around her son, but her son had to call them ""uncle"". And when each man came around they had to put an dollar in her son's piggybank! She is still installing those gold-digging ways into her son with no remorse. This book is for the women who want to know the ups and down of the industry if you are gulliable enough to get sucked into it headfirst like Superhead did! What kind of woman has respect for herself is cool with the nickname Superhead?"
3,Interesting...,"I thought that her back story was interesting. But I also think this really became a tabloid story because she never called out a lot of celebs.She exposed a lot of people for the dirt they did. And while if you're doing wrong in the dark, things eventually come to light, the way she did it wasn't impressive. I did like how she didn't tell on that one specific person, although that got out anyway. But I couldn't blame all the people she mentioned if they didn't have anything to do with her ever again.The book wouldn't have been interesting at all without the name celebrities she mentioned, though, so that's why they are included."
4,A Great Read!!,"Confessions of a Video Vixen was everything I expected it to be...although Karrine Steffans reveals secrets about some of our favorite celebs, the book gives you great insight about the real Hollywood life. Once you start reading, you will not want to put it down."
3,Interesting read,"After hearing soo much about the book from the media I was expecting a juicy tell-all, but sadly it was about the lack of self-confidence and misdirection of a black woman. I was heart-broken to hear that Karrin felt she had to ""sell"" her body to make it in the industry and that she basically helped to dehumanize women in the hip-hop world. I hope that young women will read this book and not be impressed by all the people she was ""with"", but will use this as a how-to-not follow that same path in life."
2,Happy I Borrowed It,"This book was just okay for me. I don't really know what all the hype was about. I hope she learned from her mistakes, change her life around, take care of her son and stop depending on men to make her happy. No one can bring you happiness but yourself."
4,"Word to the review ""Super HeadPlease!""","I agree with that review tittled ""Super Head Please!"" I'm from Brooklyn so I know What a hard knock life is like, and what I've witnessed in MY life is much worse then what baby girl was crying about- but hey I aint swingin from poles, shakin my but, or parting my legs either. Instead I chose school and currently a vet assistant. I'm not sayin the book isn't a good time killer or intresting to read, what I am saying is throughout all of this her claim to fame for being so loose is whack. If you're intrested in seeing what name of names she calls out then go for it, but dont go towards it looking for a ""good book"". I just gave it 4 stars for her tell all, and hinting at names of our favorite rappers & actors. Simple. It's like a big book of gossip. Even though you know it's just another form of rubbish you cant help but peak inside. Kinda like those sleezy tabloids."
3,Attention Seeker!,"Becuase the book was sold out in all of the stores that I visitied, I figured it would be worth the energy to purchase it online. However, I was disappointed by the work, and found myself wondering if the majority of the events were factual. It was (of course) quite an easy read, and at best, somewhat interesting at times, however, it read more like a ""Who's Who that I Slept With"" than a cautionary tale, which Ms. Steffans claims she sought to present. Instead of dragging all of her self-proclaimed ""lovers'"" names through the mud, as well as her own, she could have told her story without the name-calling, and had a greater impact on young girls by highlighting more of the negatives of showbusiness. Even though Ms. Steffans says she is no longer into selling her body and herself to get ahead, one look at the cover and the pictures within, and immediately the reader knows that is false. It really makes me wonder if all of her stories are as well."
3,Unbelievable!,"I have heard of people sleeping there way to the top, but wow to actually read about it is unbelievable. Video Vixen really made her way through the stars. It was an okay book. I just felt a little sorry for her because she was looking for love and money in all the wrong places. There is one star that she refused to disclose his name. I wonder if it was L.L Cool JRead the book and see if you get the same feeling. I recommend every one read This Can't Be Love! by Patricia Goins. That book is off the chain!"
3,Not as great as I thought,Everyone made such a fuss about this book. I don't get it. Where is all of this info that was supposed to be so disclosed. I can't say that I enjoyed it. There are some whom I have passed this onto and they feel the same. I think the only ones who bought it were the ones who were in it or somehow related to it. The only ones who enjoyed it were media heads.
3,kind of interesting,This book was okay. The book was mostely about her life at her moms house. I didn't buy the book to read about life at her moms house. I went to buy the book to read about her life on a music video shoot (hinting the title Confessions of a Video Vixen). She did have affairs with a lot of stars which was kind of entertaining. Overall the last half of the book was interesting. But I would not buy it at full price.
3,Expected more...,"I was eager to read this book and find out the scandalous details surrounding Karinne and her many sex-capades with the famous rap and hip-hop artists. Nevertheless, she does name drop on more than just a few, however, I felt the stories were just tidbits of info here and there. It was interesting and sad to learn about her life and all that she went through as a child and young teen. However, the book jumps around quite a bit leaving the reader wondering what happened in between. I think what disappointed me most about the book is the way she continues to live her life. She totally contradicts herself and continues to associate with some of the many creeps who mistreated her in the past. I gave this book 3 stars...1 for being an easy read (1-2 days) and 2 for the guts to write this book!"
3,Confessions...,"I am not real big on autobiographies. But this book was okay. A girlfriend of mine asked me was i going to buy this book because ""Superhead"" wrote it...i had no idea who this women was nor did i care so i rented the book from the library. I feel bad for this woman because she was raped and her mother was a nasty woman...but that does not excuse her for jumping in all these mens beds! She stayed with her sons father entirely too long (KOOL G RAP)whoever that is...and got abused too much. i guess this is just a typical case of mental and physical abused surfacing in the wrong way. In any rate i am happy she finally got herself together and decided to take care of her son and start acting like a ""woman"" instead of a whore. i do have a problem though...her story danced around certain characters she met in her life they kept resurfacing in the book once she decided she would sleep with them. i didn't really get that...Anyway Enjoy."
1,Excuses Excuses,"America please don't waste your cake on this crap. I really am angry with myself for believing the the hype it was given on the author's promo blitz. This chick cannot write, my 12 year old has better composition skills. Then I realized the author has a limited education and relied on her mouth to get her by. So ""it is what it is."""
1,Poor girl.,"If I were P.Diddy, Vin Diesel or somebody else from the book, I would call the lawyer. It`s disgusting and stupid and crazy and ..........."
3,SHE DID THAT!!!,"she needs to read Kerry E. Wagner's 'SHE DID THAT""...CUS SHE DID THAT AND GETTIN PAID FOR IT!..THE JOKE AINT ON HER(LMAO)i give it 2 stars for the material, because it wasnt a good read. but she gettin paid, so ill chunk in a extra star on GP"
2,NOT ENOUGH INFO,"I FIRST HEARED HER ON THE RADIO TRYING TO SELL HER BOOK ,SHE MADE YOU WANT TO BUY IT I WENT STRAIGHT ON LINE AND ORDERED IT ,BUT AFTER READING IT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED I NEEDED MORE DETAIL MORE NAMES ,MORE DIRT, I GOT MORE INFO FROM LISTENING TO HER DOING HER INTERVIEWS I HOPE PART 2 BE BETTER."
2,Not such an unusual story,"i feel for karrine for her childhood abuse that no one should endure, but the rest of the story is not that big of an expose. she was valued by her exterior and that is the only self worth she had. it is just a list on basic one night stands that she feels a ""connection"" with. please you were one of many doll and i know a ton of women who could have written this book. there is no moral to this story in the end it seems she is still trying to make a buck."
2,Once A Golddigger......,"always a golddigger. This time instead of digging for it in the pockets of Hollywood's elite Ms. Steffans is digging for it out of the pockets of the general public.I pity her life and what she was put through. Not all of which can be deemed her fault. However, there comes a time when you must take responsibility for your actions. That time came when she had her son but instead of properly taking care of him she pushes him off on others so that she can pursue money and sex. She claims, in her book, that everything she did was in an attempt to give her son a better life but I don't see it.I checked this book out from the public library. So, I am glad I didn't purchase it for my library.If you feel that you have just got to read this book, then borrow it from a friend or go to the library. I love Amazon.com for buying my books. But, this time I must suggest you not waste your money."
3,At the end of the day.............,"It was interesting to read at first, but at the end of the day, who really cares. I pray that she will get her life together."
2,stupid,this book was stupid. there really wasn't much confessing going on in this book. what she talked about are things people heard about on the radio or read about her online.
2,I am dissapointed!,"This book is what it is and Karrine is what she is. I was hoping the book would be a little less basic, even though I do appreciate her candor. I feel sad for her and understand where she is coming from on certain points. I felt she missed giving juicy details where there were plenty of opportunities to do so. She could have made this book even better being what it is. This what happens to women who have no self respect. I think that it is definately what not to do! Sad that she threw herself at all of those worthless men who cared nothing about her because they were famous.Anyway, my main point is that for what this book is it is really missing something big.I commend Karrine for writing to try and better herself but I hope that she will leave that life all together for her son's sake. I feel really bad for that kid. He will probably spend his life with a very distorted view on women and relationships."
3,Some like it hot only for it to turn cold,"After reading this book, I really wasn't sure how I felt. I do think it could have been written better, but the message was loud and clear. If anything, I hope this will be a lesson for those who want to live the glamorous life. It's evident that it aint all cracked up to what many people think it is."
5,GREAT TELL ALL BOOK!,THIS BOOK WAS ABSOLUTELY GREAT! I ENJOYED EVERY PAGE! I FINISHED IT THE SAME DAY I RECEIVED IT!
3,Confessions of a Video Vixen,"This book is an eye opener to anyone that has been a victim of sexual abuse. It allows others to see what it can lead to, even though this is an extreme case it is not unique. It was written for anyone to read, but any counselor/therapist would benefit from reading it to see what is sexual abuse can lead to."
1,Not what I expected,"Ms. Steffans claims that this book functions as a cautionary tale to young girls, yet, in reading it, it felt more like she was bragging. She seemed proud of the fact that she was able to bed some of today's most popular hip hop artists and have them repeatedly come back to her for more. It didn't seem like Ms. Steffans was very ashamed of her behavior either.Yes, she talked about the downside of being a ""video vixen"" (i.e. a glorified prostitute); the drugs, lack of self-worth, poverty etc. Yes, her childhood was touching and very sad. I have great sympathy for her. I'm just skeptical of her motives for writing this book. Was it for money? Recognition? Ego? Only Ms. Steffans knows..."
2,Some secrets better kept,"Total waste of money. The focus is not the industry or lessons learned from them but is more of an autobiography of her life and how screwed it was and still is (no references to change in behavior). Borrow it if you can, very easy read but not worth keeping. Sad story but could have been more of an inspirational book. It's obvious the selling point was the people she put out there and not the experience itself (some weren't even worth mentioning because it made her look used)."
5,"Cautionery, yet glorifying","The book overall was good. In some ways it was cautinery, yet some incidents seeem to be glorifying the video chick lifestyle. I don't think that saying , we dined on lobster and drank the best champagne,slept in the best suite and had the greatest sex, oh but I was depressed, and neglected my child, but I'm still partying is a way to get other young ladies not to partake in such events, I think in some ways the message comes out mixed."
3,The Stars We Love,"""Confessions of a Video Vixen"" takes readers on a glorifying journey with Karrin as she tells where, who, and how she slept with many of the men we adore. It depicts a clear picture of the glamorous life and their disgusting drug and alcohol habits. Not to mention, the negative sexual behaviors. This book was a true eye opener and a sad story of what people do for money and fame. I do not recommend this reading to young women because it glorifies ""gold digging"" and I'm still shaking my head as I think about the stars we love...~LeBlanc author of ""Characters of Lust"""
2,She pissed me off at the end!,"This book was ok but I feel like she wrote this book just for the money her claiming its to help young teenagers is a rack of B.S! because at the end of the book she was still being a groupie. How can you tell young girls that's not the life to be in but your still in it yourself! Exactly you cant!And one more thing the only time she remembered she had a son was when she was broke! Thats when she found time to go pick him up from the Nanny while they sit and sleep in the car and share a 99cent cheeseburger. She mine as well had left him at the Nanny's house, but as soon as home girl got some more money she wasnt sharing a 99cent cheeseburger with her son anymore she wasnt sharing anything with her son because he was back at the Nanny's house. All I can say is Pathetic!!!!"
2,I think people really need to stop giving this girl so much credit,"I pray that she gets help. Needless to say the book is well written. But I think that this book was written to put people on blast more so than trying to help people! She is far from being finished with her bed hopping sexcapades. I don't feel this book gives any inspirational advice. It states alot of mistakes and wrong doings, but she doesn't really give any insight to what she has learned from going through all this. I mean she ended the book speaking about her romp with Usher.The only inspiration you would get is from seeing how pathetic she looked and choosing, on your own, not to want to look like her."
1,Surely not a VIRGIN Islander,"Usually, I applaude those who are brave enough to share their lives with others, especially in the Black community, for the empowerment of our people; however, this lady(?) has left me appauled at her stupidity. In all her quest for love(?), when she supposedly MADE IT in life, why didn't she go back to the one who provided her with love (her grandmother). So was it for love, or money? To end, I was in utter awe that this book of filth was dedicated to the one person that she claims to love, her son. How can a child feel proud when mommy is sleeping with every Tom, Dick, and Harry. Big up to all the virgin islanders, because we are more than people who just dwell on a island. We chose to stay because of the God blessed beauty, and tranquility of our home. So please attempt to disassociate yourself with those who live for decency, and pride themselves in not airing dirty laundry."
2,Supper Head???,The book was reviewed by my book club and we all thought she went a little over board. It was not to help young girls like she keeps telling the media. It was to breakup homes and make being a hoe some type of goal to aspire to. The book was an easy read but it was likely fiction or a truth stretched so thin you can see through it. I do not recommend it because it lacks substance. She glorifies he nick name supper head but fails to tell her secret skill of sacking major players. Two thumbs down !!!
1,Disgraceful Mother,"It is a downright disgrace for a mother to dedicate such trash to her child. That is written proof for years to come that his mama is a hoe. She hates her mother, but he will hate her more. She is very selfish and money hungry. I did not buy the book I got it from the public library and I am glad. She is the worst then trying to ruin others lives. Some of these men are married, it's bad enough you did the dirt, but why hurt the wife, too. You are not helping anyone. Young girls reading this book won't be inspired to live right. You just exploited your dirty, filthy self to the world. You will never have a husband. You should be sued."
1,This book is pure nonsense,"I feel sorry for Karrine Steffans, but she CANNOT write! Her editor sucks! She should have had someone else edit her work because neither she nor her editor can proofread. She brags about being a novelist without going to college...that's BS. She clearly should have gone to college or taken some type of writing class, but since she didn't her book turned out like this. I felt like she kept saying the same thing over and over again...and I couldn't even finish the book. I was so bored with the content and the way in which it was delivered. This girl needs help...I do feel bad regarding the horrible things that have happened to her. However, she needs to get a life and this type of nonsense is not the way to go...I'm sure the second book was just as useless as this one...Let's get it together people!"
2,Eh,"It wasn't too bad. I just expected more of a plot; more substance, more emotion. The point of view seemed almost monotonous"
5,Excellent Book,I am still reading this book and enjoying each page. She is entertaining and mysterious at the same time. Never know what to expect from her. Great book. I recommend it.
1,Boring,She talked about the same thing the whole time. Wack. I wanted more details about everyone she was with also
4,Enjoyed the read...,Confessions of a Video Vixen was a book I had been craving to read simply because I have heard so much negative press about it I New it had to be an interesting book. My only complaint about this book was the way it jumped around in time such as when she met people it confused me in some instances and I ended up 're reading it. Other then that I loved the book and can't wait to read the next it even make me consider writing my story.
2,THIS IS NOT A BOOK THAT YOU DEDICATE TO YOUR SON!,The only reason this book was intresting is because it was telling the bussiness of SUPERSTARS! I would be ashamed of my husband if I was some of these women. It hurts my heart to find out these men were treating the other woman as if she was his wife!
4,Great Read! Coudn't put it down.,"To be honest, I initially wanted to read this book only because I was told she ""named names,"" when in addition to the finger pointing (which was satisfying to my gut for gosspip), there was a very serious and intense heart-felt story being told. When I got past the name-naming, I realized that I was in the middle of a really good book that I just couldn't put down. Thumbs up."
1,Still in denial!!!,"I am sorry to see that she felt justified with dedicating this mess to her son. I do not think she wrote this book to help anyone. I think she wrote it not only for the money, and the notability but to get back at men that left her high and dry (literally)!! She contradicted her statements in the beginning of the book with the end of the book. She only told parts of the story that would make you feel sorry for her. She left out any parts that would make her take responsibility for her own actions. She claimed her son was her reason for being but never spent anytime with him. I promise you if you read this book you will find yourself wanting to put it down and ask for your money back. The only thing that will make you keep reading it is to see who she slutted it out with next!! DO NOT PAY FOR THIS BOOK!!! IF YOU CAN BORROW IT THEN DO THAT!! BUT TRUST ME YOU WILL THANK ME IN THE END!! AND IF YOU ARE DEAD SET ON BUYING IT I WILL SALE YOU MY COPY!!!"
1,cjwhite,I really can not believe that she slept with all those men!!!And I also agree with another review that she should have waited until she was older because she really does'nt explain how and if she got out of that life.
4,Entertaining,I finished this book in two days because it was quite engrossing. This book gave me a different perspective on Ms Steffans. I found myself feeling sorry for her instead of feeling contempt. I am looking forward to her follow-up book!
1,Video Ho,"I only purchaes the book to find out what the hoopla was all about, but only found out that she is truly a woman that needed therapy, she doesn't realized that the names that she named in the book could damage many families and hurt many lives.I don't suggest anyone else buy the book, since reading it I have passed it along to friends who feel the same way. If I were her, I'd keep a low profile in NY, she is not very well likd here."
4,Video Vixen,"Wow... this was a very interesting piece of art! I was expecting it to be more detailed and less spiritual grounded.. I guess you can say. I mean, it was a great book. I read it in like four days maybe. I literally didn't want to put it down. I just had to know what was going on with Usher or Gotti. I wish she would have went into more detail about the artists and their habits... I read an interview with the artist and she was spilling more of their indepth secrets then, than she did in the book I think. I wonder does Usher really like kissing boys? I hope not!:)"
1,topman,"This is a story that is unbelievable written by a young lady of colour that is completely out of control. The grammar is poor and the plot is empty. The book is similar to Wilt Chamberlain's conquest of how many women - in this case how many men in the hip-hop and professional sports she was able to ""bag"". I purchased this book in hope that I would discover and learn something new, and it was not the case."
1,FAKE LYING B*&$H,"This book is full of lies. Listen to the interview onHot 97.com with G Rap and his current wife Ma Barker. That's all I have to say. Oh, and for all yall wanting to know who is poppy is, it is supposed to be Method Man."
2,okay,"The book was okay to me. I have the so much respect for her to get out there and tell her part to how it really went down in her eyes. Alot of people around me say ""she all lies"" but the thing about her i respect is that she has the confendence to get out there and tell it because she knew that people was gonna talk and she didnt care. What made me mad was that thing about Usher whatever went down only him and her really know so to the people that say ""Usher aint like that"" Dont ever but nothing past nobody a singer at that . but let me go but to get to the point it was an okay book."
3,video whore,"I dont mean to give such a horrible title but the title is exactly what the book is. she talks about how she gets to the top by being a whore. how she got money and survived. This book is good for people who wants to read about gossip with rap, hip hop and r&b stars."
2,Delusional overtones,"This book was just okay overall. There were really no great highs or lows to be honest. While I understood some of the issues Karrine faced, I honestly felt she was a bit delusional at times. Some of the descriptions of relationships with mega stars such Shaq, seem very vague and almost make me wonder if any of it actually happened."
3,Pleasantly surprised,"I have to say, at first, I was not expecting much out of the book given the title -- I picked it up in an airport bookshop with two connecting flights in my near future. I finished the book before the second flight landed. Ms. Steffans certainly had a story to tell and I am so glad that she included the tales of her childhood. It helped the reader connect with her as a person, and added depth to the more recent stories she tells. If it had just included the recent stories, it would have been lacking. Overall, it was well-written and she is much more talented that I expected from a new writer.Author ofThe Get A Life Campaign"
5,Sabreena's Review,This is the most intelligent way I've ever seen such an unglorious life protrayed. I was moved from the beginning to the end. Great job. Write us another one!
3,Just a Crazy Hoe!!!!,"This book was Good, Very Entertaining. I don't think she's learned her lesson and could use some counseling sessions with a professional ""Super"" head doctor i.e shrink. Cash rules everthing around her and this book is just a way to get money without her having to get down on her knees. Really all I want to know is...who is ""Papa"" in the book???"
2,rambling,Just a bunch of rambling I felt like I was sitting in front of her while I was in the waiting room of the docters and she was one of those people who just had to tell you her life story... it would have taken 30 minutes for her to finish this rambling.
4,Not too shabby...,"I was overly excited to get my hands on ""Confessions"" and once I was to the last page, the excitement had long worn off. It's a good book, full of gossip-worthy tales. It's sad and interesting to hear about her life's journey but at the end I was glad it was over. I would recommend it just because it's full of the celebrities that we all know, but you could certainly hold off buying it and just borrow from the library."
1,Not the Whole Story,"I didn't like to book because I don't think the entire story was told. She did not talk much of the others guys like shaq and Jay Z. I think she could have elaborated more. And when Bobby went out to buy drugs, I think him and her did them together in the hotel. I just don't think the entire story was told."
2,Working Girl - ...But not very honest,"I read this out of sheer curiosity with a very open mind. The book is nothing more than an attempt on the authors part to legitimize and validate the oldest profession in the world. It is inconceivable to me how a woman can ""fall in love"" with EVERY man that gives her some money for sexual favors. She plays the victim. How many women have been sexually assaulted, raped, and otherwise violated never resort to a ""tell all book."" She is in fact pimping us with her nonsense throwing around a few famous names. She got PLAYED AND PAID!!!Most men do not pay for sex, then support the prostitutes they frequent. Don't waste your money. 5 Stars to her ""editor"" for making this indeed readable because it is doubtful all Karrine can do is what she is ""famous"" for. She is an admitted drop-out and illiterate lady of the evening."
4,Good .,"Too many juicy details..I did not put it down for more than a few hours until i was finished reading it. Needless to say, there is a message in this book about the unseen ills of the industry and the lengths women would go to be accepted in this particular industry. It also depicts in detail the exploits these women are subject to at the hands of famous and successful individuals."
2,Video Vixen,"Karrine Steffans is a highly unlikable character, which is kind of hard to imagine since I usually feel a lot of empathy towards people who have been reportedly abused and also raped. Not one word from her ilicited anything but disgust from me. Yes, this is an entertaining read, but this book did not make me care about her. She says she wrote this book as a cautionary tale, but when asked, in an interview, would she have lived her life diferently if she got a second chance, she said that she would not, that she would have chosen the same path. I would not suggest this book unless you just really need to know about what some of the celebrities are like behind closed doors"
1,What waste of money and time!,"I had hoped to read about the behind the scenes music video business the exploitation and the ups and downs of the ""average"" video vixen. Not some opportunistic, name dropping, shallow , lurid crap from hip hop groupie. If I wanted to read soft porn, I know where I could go for that.It seemed that almost every known black celeb just happened to be a good friend of hers personally and that some of them also dated her for months . Hmmm!wonder how she manage to fit in these extensive dalliances with all the times she was stoned out , acting , doing videos and partying. Must be a great manager of time and a very organized person. If you believe half the sensationalistic crap here , then I am sure you are still waiting with baited breath for those long awatied WMD's in Iraq!"
2,AIRING YOUR DIRTY LAUNDRY,"This book is nothing more than a tell all tale. I read this book because of all the hype about it, however I boorowed this book, and I am glad that I didn't purchase it. I didn't think this book was all that. Karrine basically put all her business out there for everyone to know, she was bedding most of the Hip Hop and RnB music Celebrities, however if she was bedding average men and not celebrities she would be considered a common whore. She was living the fast paced life of sex, drugs, and not Rock n Roll but Hip Hop. She declares in this book that her son was her first priority, but he was neglected by her untill she got control of her life. I still don't understand what the motivation behind writing this book was. If you want to read this book, then either buy a used copy or borrow one, because it really isn't a book that anyone would want to own or read more than once."
3,All That Glitters Isn't Always Gold...,Finally a book that explores the true price of fame. I am glad a book is finally available that allows a lot of the young women out there realize that all that glitters isn't always gold. It is often better to learn from the mistakes of others than to be lost like a moth drawn to the flame that is ultimately burned by the fire.
3,All for the money,"This definitely was an entertaining book. I read it rather quickly. As I read this book, I kept waiting for thisbig revelation and a change of ways. I didn't find this!I just found that she slept with this guy and then another and then another, all this for money. Did some drugs. Did some more guys. What lesson is she trying to teach in this ""cautionary tale""? A lesson she didn't seem to learn and now she is profitting by writing about it in all it's glory."
4,to the core,"i dont agree with some of the things that steffans did in her book, but i do credit her for trying to be a good mother(sometimes) and trying to do better. I hope that she has really changed and she has made a good life for herself."
3,Predictable,It was predictable. A girl from an abusive background grows up to be a very premiscous woman. I was not impressed because it seems to me she lead this lifestyle knowing she could cash in on it later. She has hurt quite a few families along the way not to mention what it will do or has done to her own son. I personally think the book shows how a young woman without any guidance can be a total destruction. She needs help.
4,Love the book !,"The book does not describe her sleeping with Artist, NBA stars and ect but her life and how she realize what she was becoming. So Real if u can handle the drama sex and scandal !"
3,Gossip with a moral at the end,The beginning was good regarding upbringing and family life but mid book to much of the same sexual excessess. did however sum up roperly in the Q n A a the end
1,Confessions of a Video Vixen,"The book was quite 'boring' and the writing style was so parochial, I was even embarrassed that I was 'reading' it. The content left much to be desired and nothing 'really' revealing or surprising about celebrity males, especially in the Music industry - ...ohh they want to 'just have sex'...ohh 'surprise'- NOT!I threw the book away - half-way through it! Waste of my money."
2,In Awee,"Like so many others have said, Ms. Steffans is about one thing MAKING MONEY and when the well ran dry, she found another hustle, writing. she mentioned this so called ""good ole' boys club"", well the number 1 rule in those clubs is you don't tell. It's so sad that this is the images that our daughters ae looking at and up to, this girl whether she is or not is a high priiced Wh**e. I was so dissappointed after reading this book, mostly because I kept waiting for the turning point, when she realized that what she was doing and how she was doing it was wrong. But, that point never came, she said that she wanted to save young girls from making the same mistakes that she did, but the only way to do that is for her to change her lifestyle. As much as she said she hated her mother, is probably how much her son is going to hate her, just imagine him pickingup this book 10 yrs from now and reading these things about his mother. That's something that can scar a child far beyond beatings."
3,JUST OK,"THIS BOOK ALTHOUGH EASY READING WAS JUST OK. IT DID NOT HAVE THE EXCITEMENT THAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD. IT DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO GO THROUGH THE MADNESS WITH HER OR EVEN HAVE A REACTION TO THE FACT THAT SHE'S GOING THROUGH. SHE KIND OF JUST TELLS EVERYTHING SHE'S DONE THAT SHE THINKS SHE CAN BLAME ON SOMEONE ELSE. IF YOU JUST WANT TO READ SOMETHING TO WASTE TIME WHILE LYING ON THE BEACH AND YOU DON'T WANT TO REALLY ENGAGE YOUR BRAIN, THIS IS THE BOOK."
3,Wanted to see what the hype was all about.,"I first heard about Karrine Steffans when I got my latest edition of Sister 2 Sister magazine. The interview wasn't all that, however, I was intrigued with the story that she had to sell. So I purchased the book from a street vendor. I read the book in two days. I must say that the book was very entertaining for the two days that I read it. I even had a story telling session at my office with the B.S. that she had to say about some of the celebrities. She could have kept the story to herself and went out and got a job to make money."
2,Please Save your Money,"Horribly written with no real substance. I wasn't expecting much, but some good writing and something that would keep me entertained. I got neither. I did not enjoy this book at all. At the end there was nothing, most tell-alls have some substance, a reason to why they were written, a lesson or so we could see the growth in a person. The only thing I got from this book was fustration that I wasted my time ( i took the book back and got a refund) on this crap and pity for her and her son. Sometimes it seemed that this book still glorified her life. I agree with many other reviewers to read this in the library or bookstore. Save your money."
3,"NOT TRYIN' TO BE A HATA, BUT . . .",". . . LIKE ANOTHER REVIEWER SAID, I READ THE BOOK AND THEN HEARD THE INTERVIEW GIRLFRIEND ON HOT 97 WHEN G RAP AND HIS WIFE MA BARKER CALLED IN. SHE AIN'T KNOW THEY WAS GONNA CALL IN WAS CAUGHT BY SURPRISE AND HAD TO ADMIT SHE TOLD A BUNCH OF LIES IN THE BOOK JUST TO SELL MORE COPIES. TO ME THAT JUST SHAKES HER WHOLE CREDIBILITY THING.BUT I STILL GOTTA SAY I ENJOYED THE BOOK, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE AND WHAT IS JUST PURE FANTASY TO BRING IN SOME BUCKS. EITHER WAY, I FEEL SORRY FOR THE AUTHOR, BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN THROUGH SOME STUFF!"
2,CRAZY,karrine is one crazy chick.. IM SORRY i mean i like it but not amazed.. I guess i thought she would put more into the book
2,I Knew I had seen her before,I flipped through this book at a bookstore the other day just to see what the hype was all about and as looked at it all I could think was that I had seen this broad before. Then I flipped to the picture section and I started to look at the picture and then it came to me when I read that her name was superhead. I remember her from this video with Mr.Marcus and you can see why they call her superhead. I read most of the book in the store. It really is a quick read and after a few chapters it just repeats itself. I'm just wondering why she doesn't mention the porn movie in her book since she wants to put all her business out there. Seems she doesn't want confess all. Makes you wonder what else she left out the book.
1,Boring Read,The book was delivered in fine condition but my oh my was this a horribly boring book that makes the author look like an uneducated skank. My expectations were way too high for this book. Don't read it.
1,Poorly written,"It's very surprising there are so many reviews that claim ""Confessions of a Video Vixen"" is a wonderful read. While the details of Ms. Steffan's life did evoke feelings of empathy, I found the book to be disjointed, confusing, repetitive and seriously lacking depth. Not recommended."
2,Poorly written.....,yet an entertaining read- at first. It is a TELL-ALL and nothing else. I don't believe she had an editor of any sort. After the first 1/2 of the book it's just the same ole' and her distorted sense of self gets old.
2,Superhead,"This book was full of gossip, she ratted out almost everybody in hollywood that she had been intimate with! She is a prositute and proud of it, if you like hearing about who she has been with sexually, this is the book for you, I didn't learn nothing that I didn't already no, I would'nt get her newest book!"
1,what garbage,How are you gonna confess and you didn't really say nothing. If it is a confession tell it all. She said that she would not release some names to protect identies.....for what??? I need to know who you are referring to when you say that because I spent my money to find out. The book was ok but I guess she should stick to her previous job....making videos
4,JUICY !!!,"Its not great literature, but its spicy and lurid. And I couldn't put it down! If you want a quick & easy read, than you will like Confessions of a Video Vixen."
2,Horribly written but interesting topic.,"This book, obviously, has interesting information in it. However, it is poorly written and at times annoying to read since the author writes in a ""feel sorry for me"" style."
4,Great Read!,"I read this book in minutes! Very informative and interesting. Mostly about her life and her marriage with ""G"", but the juicy details about other well known rap artist and movie celebs was the best. I have her new book on pre-order."
2,Video Vixen not worth the money.,"I purchased this book on the recommendation of one of my friends. I have to say that it is an interesting look at what is going on behind the scenes in the world of hip-hop. I gave this book a 2 star review primarily because I generally did not care for the content. The author goes on and on about the fact that this is a cautionary tale for girls considering getting into the fast life as a back up dancer when it really seems like a vengeful smear campaign against people she allowed to treat her badly. Personal opinion aside, the book is shoddily put together and demonstrates a poor grasp of the English language as well as a general lack of understanding of basic grammar. In addition, the author tends to lose her thread easily and goes off on tangents that are gratuitous at best. I would say that this book is worth a read if you have nothing else in your library AND you don't have to pay for it."
3,Don't judge don't repeat,Your life is many women life but I took from this is that as a girl going into woman hood learn to say no remove yourself from the wrong people and ask God to save you and surround you with sound mind people and don't make things of this earth your God!!!!
2,Hmmm,"I read the book since it was picked for a book club read. The is nothing good to learn from this book. Read the book and trashed it, did not think it was worth it so send it to the thrift store."
2,Good gossip but little else,This book is good gossip...like US Weekly or InStyle. But it definitely leaves you feeling very sad for the confused girl.
4,Good read!,"I think this book could be looked at as a good book. Knowing that the author didn't aspire to become a writer and figuring that it would benefit society to know what really goes on behind the limelight was a great idea. Yes, it a shame that she had to experience and live the life that she lived to able to come to terms of what it is to live a ""hard knock"" life that a few of us live, but not everyone who has experienced a few demons in their lives have acheived the courage to write about it. I'll give her props from growing from the situation bcuz there are still a lot of women out there that are lost or simply put: don't want to be found! The book was interesting enough for me to finish it in one day. I would have appreicated more reading from it."
5,SUPERHEAD AT HER BEST,I loved the book . I thought it was going to be tasteless but it was done in good taste. I read the whole book in a day. Then my wife did the next ...then my Mom.....I bought the book thinking it was going to read like a sex novel ....but i was wrong ....i loved it..
3,Big deal...,"I had been searching for this book for 3 months before I was able to get it. Needless to say, I should I have borrowed it from someone. I wasn't that impressed with it. Though her story is one of trials, tribulations, prostitution and drug abuse, she's no different from other women in the hip hop. I sympathize with her child because he'll be messed from this experience forever but this is not new story."
2,Girl please!,"I am so glad I didn't spend my hard earned money on this trash. I don't believe half the stuff she wrote here, and her reason for writing this tell all....GREED AND MONEY. Same reasons for her being a video ho. Now, if she wants to do these girls a favor she needs to be real. Accept her responsibility and write a real book. Because after reading this...I don't think the average girl would change her mind. And the name dropping, well that's the only reason somebody reads anyway. No wonder they can't stand her. Anyway, nothing personal,but not what I expected."
3,"Trashy, but interesting, if you like gossip.","This book is a book for entertaining purposes. Yes it delves in the lives of women who get caught in the fame, and statue of being with those who are famous. But it also is a ""tell all"" book of peoples personal business and lifestyles of choice. The book dishes a lot of interesting ""facts"" about celebrities. If you like juicy gossip this is definitely the book for you."
3,Sad!!,"I thought ""tell all"" books were a way for writers to not only unload their soul to but to make amends as well as change their life for the better. I didn't get that feeling from Karrine Steffans. There was very little time spent on what she is doing now for herself and her son and too much time spent on her conquests.This is an OK read if you are looking for some gossip!"
1,WHAT A SKANK!!!!!,"She makes all women look bad. The book was horrible! Instead of slobbing on knobs for a buck she should have enrolled in a remedial Creative Writing course.She is the epitome of a trashy, self absorbed ho-bag that deserved everything that happened to her as an adult. SHE made those bad choices and she should pay for them. I cannot stand when dumb women proclaim to love ""dey thugs"" but then complain about the lies, cheating, beatings and disrespect they encounter.TOO DAMN BAD YOU DIRTY HOES!I will say this, writing this book is the smartest thing this walking biohazzard ever did. You see she will age. She will wrinkle. Ain't nobody gonna want her used up, stanking, disgusting arse and maybe she should have been thinking about making money other ways.The book is taudry, raunchy and tacky but that is what sells in this day and age. Read it at the bookstore if you must but don't buy this rusty crap platter's ""novel"". IT SUCKS MORE THAN SHE DOES ON THOSE MANGY RAPPERS!"
1,Hard to finish it...the worst!!,"This book was the worst! When I told people I was reading this book, many said ""Why would you read that?!?"" and now I know why they said that. Karrine tries to make you feel bad for her through out the book but I all I could feel was disgusted and embarrassed for her. I thought her life story would be interesting but it's not. She just goes on and on about how she ""thinks"" she loves this guy and that guy. It was pretty pathetic. Don't buy...it's a waste of time."
5,Hot,"Now this book is true heat, corrine did not lie she told the whole truth and I respect that.Sex,money,drugs and fame isnt was it all cracked up to be, A must read."
4,She had a rough life,"She had a rough life growing up and didn't have the teaching of how to be a lady and she use the only thing she knew. And there are a lot of women out there who can learn from her path of life. It touch home for me with the way her mother treated her, but my mother wasn't has bad has her mother but aduse it aduse."
2,Entertaining,I give this book a 2 star because I sort of knew what I was getting into before I read the book. I was looking for a book that would be a confession of an intimate nature and fast pace so when I saw the audio book of this at the local library I immediately borrowed it. Awesome tell all book! but I don't know why someone would buy a copy of this and display it at their house. Your better off displaying a autobiography book of Jackeiey Pedroe in your house....Jackeiey Pedroe who??? EXACTLY!
3,Sad Sad and More Sad,"I can't deny that this book kept my attention but that is what smut is supposed to do. It's like a car accident you don't want to look but you can't help yourself. This book is that car accident. Most of her stories are believable and some of her stories make you just say stop lying. They just test your common sense. This women is a sad species of female and I really think she could benefit from therapy instead of royalties it's bad enough that she led a nasty, trifling and degrading hoeish lifstyle but she wrote a book about it prostituting herself once more."
3,IT'S NOT ALL WHAT YOU THINK IT WOULD BE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I thought the book would be interesting. the only interesting part of her book is when she's talking about who she had relations with. but other than that it sucks. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
3,"OK, but not all it's cracked up to be/borrow it don't buy it!!","I heard about this book for the first time about two weeks ago and now my husband (who is not a book reader wants to read it because it is the talk at his job. It was ok but it was not what I expected it to be. She did alot of ""name dropping"" but her one lover""Papa"" so to speak she did not say his name for legal reasons. So you mean to tell me Ms Karrinne, the rest of your lovers didn't mind if you used their names? Never the less, this book gets more credit by word of mouth than it really deserves. Being as though, I am a book lover I will just take it as a loss and past it to my coworkers around the job and let them form their own opinions."
1,"Hmm..,I returned the book",I actually read this book in 2.5 hours. I did not think that this book was that good because I didnt see much growth. At the end of the book I still felt as though she was the same person that would hop in the bed with any celebrity given another chance. Her story could have been a lot better if she would have developed it more. This book was NOT worth $26.00.
2,Whatever!!!,"Karrine really doesn't deserve any sympathy...if that's what she was looking for. To name the men & give details the way she did was uncalled for. If she was a man, they'd have to repossess her ""playa card"" for that. Maybe this was another way for her to continue the lifestyle she had become used to. Most girls in videos are in their late teens, early twenties so possibly that counted her out. And let's not forget the fact that EVERYONE but Biz Markie has had her so she's literally a has been so I guess she had to do something. The book was garbage & disrespectful."
4,ouch,"I remember seeing her in all the rap videos. I thought, 'Man she must have a great life. Alas, she did not. It looks like she never even had a chance, thanks to her mother, and being raped and getting into the rap world filled with drugs and alcohol. She barely even took care of her own kid. I'm glad she doesn't apologize for her behavior, she points out all her faults and craziness in life. Her life was pretty sad. And thats all this book is. Pure sadness. That should be the title. Not Confessions of a video vixen."
2,Video Vixen,"Not very good writing in my opinion, I understand it's her first book, but what about the editor? The author tended to skip around a bit, which made some parts a bit confusing. I would only recommend this book for readers who have nothing else better to do, or read. It has no social value at all. The author claims she is trying to prevent young girls from making the same mistakes she made, but it seems she continued to make them the majority of her life. Even after she realized these people were only using her for sex. A very sad life."
4,Good Insight,Good insight on how sexually promiscuous gold diggers/groupies like her are made in today's societies. Liked the way it started from her early childhood all the way to where she is now. Her details on the hook ups was a great read.
2,Juvenile & repetative,"The first 5 chapters had me hooked & I couldn't put it down..but there are about 18 total & it got boring & repetitive fast. If this was the first book you've ever picked up in your life you might enjoy it. To Other people who like to read allot, it felt like an illiterate child wrote it. Explanations went on and on and so many sentences were added at times that it didnt make sense. It reminded me of my first college essay when you wrote about something you didn't care about but you were forced to write more pages than you could muster so you threw in a bunch of random junk. By halfway through I got the jist: whore meets powerful man with money, whore sleeps with man who abuses her thinking she's found love, whore ends up alone. Rinse, recycle, repeat. Don't waste your $$. I can't believe this moron was on NY Times bestsellers..dont believe the hype."
3,"Rings True, but not so entertaining.","I admit that I picked this up for some trashy fun, and that isn't what I got. A lot of the book is just bleak recollections of Karrine's life. She never learns anything, never grows, and is delusional from beginning to end. That said, I feel for her to an extent because I know/have known a lot of girls like her. I have also known a lot of animals like her, abused and damaged and no one knows what to do with them because you wanna feel sympathetic, you do feel sympathetic, but you still can't trust 'em and you're probably gonna regret even trying to help them. So it made me think and I gave it 3 stars. The juicy celebrity gossip I was looking for is really disappointing."
2,Quick but pathetic read,The author attempts to paint herself as the victim in this book. The only victim is her son who she has ignored most of his life. This is a great story on how low a human being will go in search of fame. Do yourself and favor and don't waste your time or reward the author by purchasing this book. I'm sorry I made that mistake.
3,The real tragedy was not her....,"I like alot of other reviewers here felt sorry for this woman in the beginning, but after she continued to get herself in all of this b.s. I cared less and less for her, there was only 1 story that messed me up and that involved the last few days of Merlin Santana(Romeo of the Steve Harvey show), if her words are truthful then we get a first hand account into the way hollywood throws away it's young talent, I will admit that I did sympathize with Karrine as she remembered how broken down in appearance and spirit Merlin became in his last days, everything from how he was treated at clubs by the security to how he needed to spend the night with her cause he had no where else to go to. That is the real tragedy in this book, I will admit that this book would make a damn good movie!"
1,Trashy gossip lit,Mindlessly entertaining if reading about a floozy sleeping her way to the top of the bottom amuses you. I'm ashamed to confess that I gobbled up every uninspired word.
3,"Very Informative, but that's it","This book was not all that spectacular, but very informative to know who the groupie lovers are. I must say the name ""Superhead"" fits her well! It almost diminishes K. Steffan's character even more because these episodes recently ended in 2004 (as far as we know). It makes you wonder if her lifestyle has really changed. I hear there is a part 2 coming soon so I guess we will find out soon."
4,Speechless,"I almost dont know where to start or what to say about this book. I will say that it is worth buying it will keep your interest, I read it in less than a day. It's leaving me with a feeling of whats your point but at the same time I couldn't stop reading it. The story was very interesting but I was wondering if it was all true - you judge.And for everyone that has already read it - who is ""papa"" (I'm dying to know) ?"
2,Just...,"Sold! To the young man in the corner with the fat gold chain, Timberland boots, and #1 Billboard Rap Single.Just sad what this girl went through as a youngster and then subjected herself to as a young woman. How does one, upon meeting a Jay-Z, Diddy, or Usher, think, ""Drop to my knees."" At some point, you gotta have the chutzpah to say, ""No mas."" Based on the sequel, she's still searching for it.An easy read and an even more interesting list of who got done. Get it from the library."
2,It wasn't much of a page turner,"I give Steffans props for using real names in her book. With 'Hiding in Hip Hop' and 'Celebrities between the Sheets' leaving the reader to figure out who is who, I am glad she didn't go that route. The book was interesting but far from great. Steffans tends to over explain her actions, as if the explanations would excuse her behavior. If it look like a freak and act like a freak, it's a freak <----Steffans."
1,Total Trash,"I am surprised I was even able to finish this book. The woman really needs to get a life, be a better parent and stop writing trash!"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I quite enjoyed this book, as you can see by my rating.I was expecting a simple story about how a woman with no discernible talent, education or self-respect basically slept her way to fame. And it is that, but also so much more.Her story is very engaging. It was interesting to see the dynamincs between her and her parents and how that affected her relationships. And I must admit that her sexal escapades with industry bigwhigs made for juicy reading.Steffans was a drug addicted stripper who is now a New York Times best-selling author. Sure, she didn't take the route that many of us would deem respectable or ideal, but her journey of self-discovery and triumph makes this book a good read."
3,multistep numerical methods for initial-value problems,"stability,consistent and convergence of multistep numerical methods for initial-value problems"
1,Fun Premise Terribly Executed,"When a suburban family whose idea of ""the American Dream"" is living in a small NYC apartment and getting their daughter into a preppy school, hilarity ensues....or it should have. I am a huge Neil Patrick Harris fan, and Amy Sedaris often has moments of comic genius. Here though, their talent is squandered while navigating a script that was miraculously made in the first place. There is a reason this movie is direct-to-DVD, and isn't worth watching for anything. I am no prude, but there were scenes in this movie so inappropriate within the context of the premise, I found myself offended. Many scenarios are forced and silly (the bad kind of silly), and the movie couldn't end soon enough for me. You were warned."
4,Sectarianism as a multi-million dollar business.,"Bill Murray has scored big time depicting the history of two football rivals in Scotland and how they mirror the attitudes of society as a whole. This book depicts the hatres, bigotries and misconceptions portrayed by both clubs. Murray also shows us how each club has parlayed their sectarian beliefs into a multi-million dollar business, not just in Scotland but throughout the world. And through it all both clubs deep down realize that each one could not exist without the other. I highly recommend this book not only to fanatics of football but to history, economic and sociology fanatics as well."
5,A wonderful book with incredible questions,"I am neither Latino nor Jewish, but this book has hit home with me. It is an incredible, and risky, exploration into what makes the truth, what destroys the truth, and what links the truth to evil. The moral questions in THE NATURE OF TRUTH have been with me for weeks after I read it. The book is sexy, and controversial, and opinionated, in a way most books are not. I think most books are for entertainment. This book is way beyond that, for the pursuit of questions essential to most of our lives."
4,nice for birding,"I am a beginner birder but have had the good luck to use zeiss and leica binos. A friend was shopping for a set and he gave these pair a whirl, he was impressed and me valuing his opinion ordered them from ... After limited use I'm very happy with them. The negatives: heavy, large for 32's, minimum focusing distance of 19 ft could be a problem, my set focused as close as 15 ft. A minor annoyance is the putrid smell of rubber, a necessity due to the waterproof nature, hopefully it will go away. The eye cups are a bit too long, I prefer rolling them down even though I don't wear glasses. All in all, very nicely made and a lot of value for the money."
1,An awful book,"Horn Book reviews are 99% on target. I was looking for a good series for Grade 1. What a disappointment. All of the characters seemed stereotypes and some were rude. One character calls another ""mental."" An example of poor writing."
1,Yikes! Ugh! Don't get this set!,"This is a slapped together collection of event footage that has no accompanying coherent or interesting or informative narrative along with it. Really sloppy and uncaring assembly here. You could care less about what is on the screen.I cut my teeth on the truly excellent Bud Greenspan tv series back in the seventies that made me an Olympic fan ever since. Bud carefully & lovingly crafted his stories about one competitor for each show and wove together the human story of background, desire, striving and excellence in the pursuit of victory. His series are masterworks. Watch them if you can find them.But avoid The Olympic Series."
5,Wow!,"OK, so these 3 disks don't cover every single event in the history of the Olympics. If they did, no one would have time to watch them. And it may not include every event that some viewers think should be there, but it's still excellent. Not all of the US vs. USSR hockey game is there, but it is the finale most will want to see, and it is there.I really liked the wide selection of material, some that I remembered, some I'd never seen, and some that I'd somehow forgotten. Anyone with the mildest interest in Olympic athletics should be thrilled with this set."
1,Bud Greenspan This Isn't,"These DVDs were just a waste of money. I'm a big fan of filmmaker Bud Greenspan and his documentaries on the Olympic Games. When I purchased this product, I believed I was getting DVDs of Greenspan's work. In fact, I found these DVDs on Amazon by typing in Bud Greenspan's name on the search line. Clearly, he had absolutely nothing to do with this product. I feel like I was duped and wasted by money. I'm very disappointed with Amazon for leading me to believe Bud Greenspan had anything to do with this product. Shame on Amazon for its quality control. Come on, guys. Stop spending so much time and effort hawking the Kindle and focus a little more on providing other product information your loyal customers can rely on."
4,Great speed-loader!!!,"This is great!!! its better than those manual speedloaders.PROS:holds alot of bbsreally fast loading hi cap clipsCONS:loud, so if your a sniper it could reveal your coverno cover to hold bbs from falling from the ejection point, so you would have to push them down."
5,Really Great Album For A True Tamia Fan,I bought this CD because someone who borrowed my previous never returned it. I obviously really love Tamia's music or I would not have bothered. This is definitely a CD to have in your collection. I really love it and interstate music was very careful in packaging and securing the item.
2,"Okay well 2.5 stars, but that's it!!!!!!!","Now.I love Tamia as a person and as an artist. This album was disappointing though. First of all, tamia voice is too beautiful to sing all those pop, dance, wack tracks that she have on this album. The only good things about this album is mainly Shep tracks that he produced. I just pray that Tamia sticks to ballads and away from Missy and Dallas! ..."
3,Tamia's second album.,"Tamia's first album is one of my favorites. She is an awesome singer. That said, this album is disappointing. If you like the R&B that is popular nowadays, you will like this album. Most of it is mid-tempo, with programmed rhythm, and lacking in melody. Her biggest asset, her voice, is wasted. The closest she comes to singing is on Stranger in My House, a so-so song.The songs are nothing great. None really stand out. By the end, they all pretty much sounded the same. The guest rappers are annoying, mostly because I would rather be listening to HER. And since there are no lyrics included, there are some phrases that will forever be a mystery.She is still one of my favorites, though."
4,A strange in my house,In all the record is the boom -- because it is a mix of senuality and romantic with the undertones of wanting to fall in love or to recaputure the love you had with your partner. But the song that I love on this cd -- you poeple did not allow me to sample and I did not like that !
4,"Wonderful Voice, Pretty good songs","Tamia's vocal range and talent is still superior to most of the R&B acts out nowadays. If only she could get some material that would allow her to showcase all of her talent! Her first single, ""You Put a Move on My Heart"" showed so much promise, and you definitely get to hear glimpses of it on this album. It's almost as if the producers decided that we couldn't handle an entire album filled with her showing off her capabilities, so they decided to ration it out. Favourites include her remake of ""Love Me in a Special Way,"" ""If I Were You"" and ""Can't No Man"" (all ballads). ""Can't Go for That"" is pretty funky too."
1,"Great voice, Terrible songs","I wore out Tamia's first CD and bought the second one in hopes she would come with an album equal to or better than the first. However, it appears as though she hit a sophomore slump. I think Tamia has a wonderful voice, but it was wasted on this CD. The songs were nowhere near that of her first album. IMO, Tamia should go back to what worked before. Except for a remake of ""Love Me in a Special Way"", the quality of the songs was not very good.I'm sure it's important for an artist to grow and try different things. In this case, I'd recommend going in different direction than what she tried here."
2,A good voice does not a good cd make,"I brought Tamia's new CD based on loving her first one. Plus while I thought her first single from her new CD was cool, I loved the second song on the single ""Tell me who"". But alas Tamia has went the route that most R&B has taken lately. Nothing new to add, just the same old tired and old blahness. It's CD's like this one that make me rejoice to know that at least in this category of music if not for anybody, at least you can count on Mary J. Blige to always deliver. She has the voice, and the music to back it."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"Unfortunately the cd I'm reveiwing is a download version of Tamia's ""A Nu Day"" which is alot better than the original. I love this cd and Tamia's voice is banging and her songs are produced by Missy Elliott, Shep Crawford, & Dallas Austins wich r top Producers but they kinda lack on the songs which I'd expeted to be more better.~TRACKLISTING~01. Can't Go For That (4/5)02. I Wanna Be (5/5)03. GO (3/5)04. Dear John (4/5)05. Long Distance Love (5/5)06. It's A Party (5/5)07. Spend My Life With You (5/5)08. Can't No Man (5/5)09.

1,"I totally agree with ""music fan from Brooklyn, NY""","I totally agree with ""music fan from Brooklyn, NY"", it was stupid.I was in love with her first album,and it was so good.Really I bought A Nu Day before her self-titled album.And was very dissapointed with it.I wanted my money back, too.To me all the songs on there were horrible but Stranger in my House, and Can't No Man. But my friend had her first album and was playing it on the C.D. player,and I had to get it.I fell in love with it immediatly. If I were Tamia I would have been ssssoooo mad at Missy Elliot for messin' up this album.I will never take a chance on a Missy produced album again."
4,Two thumbs up!,"I've been waiting for this one. Unlike many artists' sophomore albums (i.e. D'Angelo's ""Doo-Doo"", opps I mean ""Voodoo""), Tamia's proves to be as good as the first. I'm a ballad lover myself, but the sassy uptempo songs on this album I'm definately feeling. Way to go Tamia! Thanks for not letting me down."
2,Not Worth $15.11,"Tamia is very beautiful and very talented but like the last cd, she has very ordinary music. I bought this cd for ""Stranger in my house"" hoping that the rest of the tracks would grow on me but they didn't. Nothing on this cd approaches the strength of that song. ""Tell me who"" is a decent ""I think you're cheatin'"" on me songs sung with great attitude. ""If I were you"" is a syrupy but likeable ballad. Tamia's strenghts are definitely ballads. All the dance tracks are horrible. ""I can't go for that"" was a bad choice for a remake. Snoop Dogg and 213 are the stars of the remix while Tamia sounds like a regular back up singer. The best thing about this cd is that is an enhanced. You get a Tamia video and Tamia screen saver. Someone needs to help Tamia with material selection."
3,the album is worst,"the album is wasted your money,there's just only Stranger in my house is the best song of her(maybe her best so far!!!)i love Tamia,her music/vocalist are so emotional,strong,she's very talent!!! i love her 1st album,she have done a great job with the cover Careless whisper....so i thought that her 1nd cd will be great too but i was wrong.....i gave it 3stars for Stranger in my house,i love this song,she had a voice,her voice is use for beautiful ballad not those catchy(crap) beat!!!!!!!don't buy it,if you love stranger in my house,go but the single,not 4the whole album,waste your money+time to listen to it!!!!"
2,after Quincy Jones it's down hill,after working with Quincy Jones it is all down hill Musically.with Q Tamia showed hope.but this is all formula driven R&B.Love me in a special way the classic from Debarge&the Great Mind Of El Debarge sounds good here.but the Re-make of Hall&Oats's I can't go for that (no can do)is weak.Brian Mcknight did it better on his debut album.She has Talent but this is no justice.
5,She's DOne It Again!,"Tamia has done it again. This CD is terrific. Each song has its on positive appeal. My favorite tune,however,is ""Can't No Man."" Sometime when I'm in that jazzy and lonely mood, I put that song on, sit back, close my eyes and enjoy the pleasure of this emotionally nurturing and melodic song flowing through me. There's something mesmerizing about Tamia's ballads. Her bouncy tune ""I Can't Go For That"" is certainly an anthem for battered women all over the world! I do hope that Tamia collaborates with Missy Elliot again in the future on another hit song as she does with the song ""I Wanna Be."" I'm telling you that Tamia's voice is one that you will never forget."
5,This surpases her freshman album,"This album was absolutely amazing. Since the first time I heard Tamia on ""Move on my heart' I have been an enormous fan of hers. Now with A NU DAY her voice has totally captivated me.Songs such as ""Stanger in my house"" ""I Can't go for that"" and ""Long distance love"" are amazing. If I could persuade you into buying any album it would be this one. Especially if you like songs that vary on different subjects."
2,Really Disappointed,"What makes the album bearable? Tamia's lovely vocals, her ability to belt out a track is a thing of beauty. She is no doubt my favorite singer right now.Why is this album bad? The production. The over producing or lack there of, take your pick, really brought Tamia down. Only two songs stand out, ""Stranger In My House"", which isn't all that great and the remake ""Love Me In A Special Way"", which makes every other song on this album sound elementary.Maybe it was high hopes, after all, I loved her self titled debut, and been in love with her since ""You Put A Move On My Heart"" dropped in '95. ""Nu Day"", is a definate pass."
1,Boring,"This cd is boring and lame. Tamia has a nice voice and I don't understand why she would waste it on some silly mainstream pop. I was exptremely dissappointed with this cd. All the tracks sound somewhat alike and after a while you just forget them alltogether, cause the songs really don't make a lasting impression. Oh well...maybe she does better next time."
2,Nothing Nu Under The Sun,"Tamia has an amazing voice, but that is it. She has yet to carve out her personality and stand out from the other R&B divas. The only good songs on the album where 3 (Can't go for that),6 (Long distance love),and 13(Can't go for that remix). She's great on the uptempo tunes, but the ballady stuff doesn't make ample use of her voice. They always cut her off. They don't let her soar. The production overpowers Tamia. If Tamia had the right songs, she could dominate the urban pop field."
1,"2 Good songs,the rest garbage","This cd is horrible. She should have picked better songs. 'Love Me In A Special Way' and 'Stranger In My House' were the ONLY good songs! I bought the first one (which was AMAZING) and could not wait for the new one,well it sucked! She should have worked with good people like Mariah Carey,Babyface,Darkchild,Dianne Warren,Darkchild,etc... Well,hopefully she'll have a better one out later!"
4,"Thorough overview of major issues, an essential introduction","Hosper's ""An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis"" wasthe text for a philosophy course I took a long time ago-- 1965. I have had kept it in my library ever since.It serves me as a reference and periodic refresher on theterminology and principle issues of Western philosophy. Ifyou keep forgetting the true meaning of ontology, deism,epiphenomenalism, the emotive theory of ethics, etc., thisis the book for you. If you get into arguments in anyof these areas, buy this book! Hospers uses practicalexamples from everyday life and mixes in some clever withere and there."
3,The negative reviews have a point,"I agree with the negative reviewers to the extent that this book and its predecessor, ""Surviving the Breakup,"" are unremittingly bleak. What's interesting is that if you read Hetherington's ""For Better or for Worse,"" which is based on a 1,400-family study (unlike this book, which was based on 60 families), you'll get a very different and--I think--more nuanced account of the range of experiences associated with divorce. I found Wallerstein's books interesting, but they're practically apocalyptic.These Wallerstein books, it's worth mentioning, are not self-help books. ""Surviving the Breakup,"" in particular, is misleadingly titled. The books primarily describe research findings and don't offer much in the way of tips and guidance. You're more likely to come away with the sense that the damage has been done and everyone is screwed forever."
1,I hated this book,"What a self righteous load of crap! The purpose of this book, I think, is to scare unhappily married people out of getting divorced. It details all of the different ways in which the children and their parents are still miserable ten years later. Obviously, divorce is painful, but sometimes, inevitible...Who needs to read this during such a difficult time? The truth is there are many, many ways to screw up kids...divorce is just one!"
2,Disappointing,"After reading this book, the question looms large as to why Dr. Kissinger bothered to ""write"" it. It is essentially a selected collection of phone logs between Dr. Kissinger and his cohorts during the Yom Kippur War and the last days of the Vietnam War. If you are halfway interested in politics and history, there is nothing in this book that you don't already know, other than being able to glean through the actual words spoken by the policy makers of the time - what was ""behind the scenes"" was not startlingly different than what was on the TV screen.I am disappointed with this book, not least because I am much impressed by Dr. Kissinger's other work, especially his defining tome: Diplomacy.I am thankful for the tip given by the previous reviewer from Amsterdam, pointing out where to get the declassified information from the NSA. He was right. The account (of the Yom Kippur War) from the declassified NSA documents was more succinct, balanced and overall more informative."
1,Kissinger shows his incompetance once again,"I don't know why I try to stomach reading books from a war criminal. I suppose we all must read and listen to the criminal mind so that we can understand why they become such monsters. I've read Hitler, Stalin, and Kissinger (and the rest). Don't buy this book...instead find yourself a copy of the book or documentary called ""The Trial of Henry Kissinger""."
1,Want the truth?,"Some of the authors of these reviews seem to think that the authors of this book are liberal humanists. I don't care what they call themselves, anyone who reads the book will quickly realize that the authors are Reagan republicans. Since I know Cummings personally, I can assure you that he is a dyed in the wool conservative. He started out as a therapist, turned into a businessman, and sold his business for mega millions of dollars. Like most capitalists, his only interest is money. Some people just never have enough."
5,Get's the Job done! Look no further!,"I have a cat that recently starting getting UTIs. As you probably know when cats do not feel well they can't say ""mommy / daddy it hurts when I pee."" Nope, he couldn't do that; so he peed on the wood floor to let me know. Poor baby! Tried this cleaning spay to get out the urine smell and it worked like a charm! My bf who has a noise that can smell ANYTHING bad couldn't believe the results. He said ""you have to write a review!"" It really works. I wouldn't waste your time or money with other products. This stuff gets the job done!"
1,Didn't do a thing,"This product did not work as advertised. The urine smell remains in my carpet. I am currently allowing a full box of baking soda ""rest"" on the area, hoping this will help alleviate the smell."
2,doesn't work,Yea this stuff doesn't work either. None of these specialty products work completely and none seem to be designed for hardwood floors. The one Nature's Miracle Hardwood floor product only masked the odor for a short time.
4,So far so good!,Seems to remove the pee/poo odor so my puppy doesn't relieve himself in the same spot again. Works fine on my wooden floors
5,"Natures Miracle Stain and Odor Remover, Trigger Spray",This stuff is unreal it really does get animal pee and stale milk smells out of carpet. I had spilt milk on the carpet at work and the smell was woefull now there is no smell.
1,This stuff sux,"It worked for 1 day and then the odor returned. I ended up using a home remedy that was not only effective but much, much cheaper. I found a site that offered to rememdies to remove cat urine odor in my rug. The first was to mix white vinegar and water, 50-50. The second was to mix peroxide, baking soda, and a few drips of dish washing detergant. I did both remedies, one after the other, and although to smell was a bit poignant and my son had to sleep with me for a night becuase of the smell and the chill in the room, it worked and the smell hasn't returned. This neutralizes the amonia in the urine crystals permanently."
2,didn't live up to hype,"i purchased this at the recommendation of store employee.it smelled like rubbing alcohol. took away the smell right away.i believed the claim ""...discourages pets from urinating on same spot again..."" however, my stubborn dog went right back and did it again !!i'm gonna try something else this time."
3,Works sometimes...,"This ended up being a worthwhile purchase for me as it worked on some of the crystallized sweat stains on my shirts. In particular, it appears to have fixed a $20 shirt I got from the Field Museum in Chicago as a souvenir. Why only 3 stars? Well, it didn't work so well on other shirts. Same deodorant, same person sweating, most of the time 100% cotton. Maybe it has something to do with how the shirts are woven or the particular dyes used? There's a good chance you will get your money out of the product, but there is no miracle here and you might find something that works just as well for cheaper."
2,Empty Box,"When I received this item, I found the box was almost empty. The drive was there, but little else. There was a slip that told me where to put the safety stickers, but there were no stickers. Also included was a sheet telling me where to get service. And that was it. No installation instructions, no software, nothing. Purchase this item only if you have the technical knowledge to install it and getting it working on your own. Toshiba will not be of much help."
5,Emergency addditive to personnel survival,"Great emergency blanket. Great to keep in a bugout bag, auto, and as a Christmas stocking stuffer for loved ones."
1,Got Bubble Wrap ?,"I've never submited a bad review before, that is until I got a broken ""grenade"" in the mail. I was surprised how well Amazon and this company responded to my less then happy review. The company told me to throw out the old one and they will send me a new one. Well, then they emailed me that the rest of them they had in stock were also broken so I had the choice of waiting for new stock or they would send me a similar one. I requested a similar one (The Pineapple looking version). In a about a week I recieved the same kind I requested originally, and it was also broken. Hello, Im going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they are not stupid enough to send me another broken one, they just dont know how to package this item properly to keep it from breaking on the way to me. SO, unless you plan on picking up the item, I dont suggest you buy it."
5,Review,"Great stand. Better value than the DW 5000 stands. Heavy enough for serious play. If you want something light, for other reasons, you might as well buy the sound percussion brand for 29!"
4,No cricut rewards,Cartridge is great! Take note that this cartridge is not the list of eligible cartridges for cricut rewards ([...]). Wish I had done my homework before buying.
3,Opposites Attract,I agree with another reviewer on the connecting aspect of the letters. So I don't use it nearly as much as I use other letter cartridges.
5,Good Source,"I take anywhere from 500 - 800 mg of Niacin a day, with the majority coming from this product. The tablets do not taste good, but they are small and round and work. I do receive a flush from this product as quickly as 20 minutes after taking it. The company ships quickly and I receive my package within three days. I recommend this product to all my friends and family because of the importance Niacin plays in diet."
5,attention all fairy-believers!,"very enjoyable. currently reading ""the rebel fairy"" which i highly recommend to all fairy-believers out there :)"
1,Couldn't keep my eyes open!,"It may not be a fair review, because I technically didn't read the book. I just couldn't get into it."
4,Glorified exfoliator,"This product is great, but is mostly just an exfoliator. It has a grainy texture, which I was not expecting. It works at removing spots on elbows, knees, etc... but you could just use an exfoliator that you already own and it would work exactly the same."
4,bueno de calamaro,"Este album esta bastante bien. Tiene 25 canciones, la gran mayoria cortitas, 2 minutos max, pero como siempre, muy buenas letras y musica. Especialmente las letras. El tema ""el salmon"" esta muy pegajoso. El cafetin de buenos aires, otro tanguito que metio calamaro, muy disfrutable como en el album anterior. Si eres fanatico de calamaro, tienes que tenerlo, muy buen value for money."
1,No me gusta,"Menos es más. Uno de los misterios del mundo es que a alguien le gusten los temas de Andrés, sobre todo porque no hay originalidad, se entiende muy mala leche de fondo en las letras (muy argentino)y además sus producciones no aportan nunca nada nuevo. Pero si han premiado a otros porteños con tan poco talento como él, por ej. a Fito y lanzado también a Coti, debe ser que el mercado está sordo y desorientado. Prefiero a Charly, Gieco, Spinetta, Moris..."
3,interesting read,I was very anxious to read this book. It was very fast paced and easy to get through. I picked it up on a lazy Sunday afternoon and couldn't put it down until I finished it. It just held my interest from page one. The only negative thing I would say is the hype about Danielle Staub was way overrated. She is just a very small part of the book and not even the most interesting part. She should get over herself. Kevin Maher proved to be quite an interesting individual for me.!!!!
2,cop without a badge,"was an ""OK"" book. Only wanted to read it because I watched the Housewife's of New Jersery show and wanted to see what the big table flipping episode was truely about. About the book if I wanted to learn how to inhance a corvette engine & be an informateI think I got the education on that."
4,Very Interesting....Was Glued to this book!,"Been wanting to read this book for awhile now, and finally decided to buy it. I honestly thought it was going to be this rambling type non fiction, but was actually surprised from it. I really enjoyed it and cut not put it down, every chapter was exciting. This book was mentioned on the real housewives of new jersey, season 1. So I wanted to find out more on Danielle's Story and her connection to the book by K. Maher. I also purchased her memoir, the naked truth and finding out her side of the story!Its worth buying!!"
4,Cop Without A Badge,"I really enjoyed the book, it however did not have as much about ""Danielle"" from The Real Housewives of NJ as I thought it would compaired to all the problems that it caused on the show but was pleasently surprised by all that Kevin went threw in his life. I would recomend this book if you are looking for some good police/crime reality read."
3,OK,Bought this book because we are both reality freaks....seems like the story is better than the book itself...it was an ok read tho if all that stuff is true....
4,Definitely an entertaining story,Before I bought this book I knew it wasn't a book about Danielle who is absolutely disgusting. And when I read the reviews I almost didn't buy it because they were so bad. But I did buy it and read it almost in one sitting because it was that fascinating. After going back and reading the reviews tonight I am very disappointed to read from apparently family members that it basically a bunch of lies as I only read non fiction. What a shame he has such low character. Of course anyone who would do the things he did can't be that great. But I gave this book a good rating because I thought it was well written and very engaging. Hopefully Hopefully Kevin is living a more productive and meaningful life.
1,save your money,I admit I bought into all the hype. Had to have it. It's awful. Can't even finish it.
3,It was entertaining....,"I have no idea about the validity of this book. I assume about 50% of it is probably true and the rest is the bravado of Kevin Maher. Needless to say, it was an interesting and entertaining read. He definitely is very detailed oriented which makes me MORE likely to believe a lot of what he says. However, his recreations of certain conversations are like a mafia wannabe handbook. I also read Danielle Staub's book, and I imagine their reality falls somewhere in the middle of both of their stories - since they are pretty much opposite. I have to give it to Maher though - he definitely has a hightened sense of self!"
1,Cop without a badge,Kevin Maher is nothing but an over paid rat...The book is not really the well written and is over the top on gushing about Kevin Maher who is nothing but a rat criminal...He is not a cop without a badge.
3,RHWONJ Has An Unsavory Past,"I have to admit to my guilty pleasure of being a fan of RHWONJ. When this book was mentioned on the show, I thought it would be fun to read. The book has little to do with the housewife Danielle, other than a few pages that relate to her affiliation with the ""Cop Without a Badge"". The fact is that Danielle was an exotic dancer and she was arrested, so her past life did catch up with her despite her name change.The story is an engaging one, and as some other reviewers note, you have to wonder where tales have been embellished or told to suit Mr. Maher. In any event, the story gives the reader some insight as to how deals are made, informants are used, and the crazy life associated with drugs and criminal behavior."
3,cop without a badge,"Amazon.com delivers what they promise and are set out to deliver. Amazon.com takes a lot of pride in their integrity, and for obvious reasons. Try it once and you'll go back for as long for they will be around. Great source, great timing, great savings. Congratulations and keep up with the fantastic work they are doing!"
2,Not that good,"Get it at the library. Much cheaper for a book that hasn't got that much information on Dannielle Staub. Besides, the leading character sounds like he was nothing but a informat for the police all his life. And he thought he was working for the police undercover, huh? Not hired by the police, just an informat."
1,"Try ""Cop without his facts straight""","Just what kind of fact checking was actually done on this book anyway? Kevin Maher always has and always will be known as a snake and for anyone to take his word at face value is incomprehensible. Kevin, I hope you are reading this. A set of facts as simple as those surrounding the death of your father you have distorted to suit you and make you look like a superhero. Your father did NOT die 8/9/74 the day you were released from prision as your story so eloquently puts it, with you rushing to his side just a minute too late. Your father died Aug. 9 of 1977 of a heart attack on the subway. You would not take care of the burial arrangements so your uncle Ron had to purchase a plot in Fairview Cemetary in NJ to bury him where he rests today, left out the part about how you got your Uncle Patrick kicked off the force and had the nerve to show up for his wake. You always were and are, a slimeball. This book is a farce."
2,Cop without a Badge,"This book was good, but not $189.00. good! Funny after people watched ""Housewifes of New Jersey"" and talked about one of the cast members being in it, the price shot up. Belive me it is not worth $189.00."
1,New Edition $18 out July 1 isbn 1-4391-7638-8,Just so you know: there is a paperback reissue due out July 1. Amazon has the price listed as $18.00 ISBN 1-4391-7638-8A little patience will save you a lot of money
1,"About ""Daniell""","Of course no one is going to pay this kind of money for that book, and I wouldn't pay that much on ebay either. All you need to know about ""Danielle"" is on Gawker, the two pages she is in the book, and her mug shot. Save your money, this will never be a collectors item.Oh, and her real name is Beverly Merrill, you can find all you want with that info."
1,Cop without a Badge,"Kevin Maher, you should be ashamed of yourself. I have never seen so many lies in one book in my life."
4,Cop w/o a Badge Book Review,"I bought this book because I am a REAL HOUSEWIVES OF NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, ATLANTA & ORANGE COUNTY fan and waited forever for it to come available. Like everyone else I wanted to read the dirty laundry list on Beverly aka ""Danielle"" of New Jersey's Housewives. Even though it didn't have alot about her except for what we already knew --- basically a lying, cheating, stripper coke whore I really enjoyed the book. It looks like she hasn't changed & I hope Kevin Maher & Charles Kipps profited from her leaking of the book, which I'm sure she did for publicity & of course because she has no self respect or conscience....LOLThis book is a great read & I commend the honesty & of Kevin Maher & the writing talent of Charles Kipps."
2,IT LOSES GPS SIGNALS,It loses GPS signals while you drive and cause to go wrong ways. It doesn't speak from its own speaker. It is not as good as they explained on the Internet.
4,Beware! Older edition not the same!,"Great introductory book for those studying shamanism with an open mind - it's a blend of anthropological academic theory, and more... esoteric considerations of the subject. As it's more of an overview, it's definitely not the only book you'll want, but it can be a good addition to a beginning collection. However, buyers need to BEWARE that Amazon's ""new and used"" section links from the newer version of this book, ""The World of Shamanism,"" to an older version, ""The Spirit of Shamanism,"" which is not quite as comprehensive. Either is worthwhile, but for those seeking a more up-to-date reference, be sure you are selecting the newer version before you order."
5,This DVD Set is AWESOME!!!! Quickly received from Amazon,"My wife and I have been struggling to communicate and as a result has caused friction. Since purchasing this DVD set, we sit down and watch a disc after we put our kids to bed and cry from laughing so hard. The tools, and analogies Dr. Emerson uses are incredibly accurate. My wife and I are going to probably start giving this set out as Wedding gifts with the instructions to watch it at the couple's first anniversary. We would like to sit through one of his seminars."
5,Great for Married Couples,This is an encouraging series for married couples or those planning to be married. He also makes it humorous and gives ways to communicate with your spouse about tough issues and putting the stress on Emmerson rather than yourself or your spouse. He does a great job explaining the differences between spouses so that you can better understand where your spouse is coming from.
5,BUY THIS!,"If i could I would give it 10 stars and make every married couple i know watch this. The best $145.00 ever spent, a wonderful investment in your marriage/family. Worth your time and your money. My husband and i watched this when presented at our church. We liked it so much that we purchased 2 copies, one for the church library and the other that we can loan out. It has helped our marriage tremendously. The book is good, but the DVD conference is AWESOME....great speaker....you will be challenged and you will laugh. I can't say enough good about this. Buy it and be blessed."
5,Watch this with your spouse!,"A great presentation of this topic! The speaker is funny, practical and gives down to earth advice that works! Especially good for husbands who probably prefer watching a DVD rather than reading the book or going to a seminar...within 5 minutes of watching it my husband said ""That is us!"""
3,Thought It Was Easier To Learn,"I bought this DVD thinking it was a cartoonish type lesson for my 4 year old daughter. I based that assumption purely by viewing the cover art. I set out to find a cartoonish video because my daughter keeps her attention better to those.I was wrong. Its a man and child showing how to play the guitar. Overall, its not a bad instructional video but for my 4 year old its just too confusing.I bought a piano DVD along the same lines and its wonderful. I wish I could find one that teaches guitar like that."
1,Ridiculously small,"I bought this case to hold a 7"" player. Because the picture shows the player open in the case, I thought that meant the player could be used while in the case. It cannot, because the player fits in the case so snugly there is no room for the battery. The battery doesn't come close to fitting in the outside pouch, either. I bought this case to have one bag to hold all my DVD supplies, but I would end up needing to carry the battery elsewhere, so I returned it."
2,amazon's mistake,"While there is nothing wrong with the case itself, it DOES NOT fit the portable DVD player Amazon connected it with...it was extremely disappointing on Christmas morning to have someone open their gift - a dvd player and case together - only to find it didn't fit. Amazon should take more care in recommending products."
1,no good bag,"This bag is too small, you can buy a very good bag at the same price at frys or best buy., which is bug and has good space to carry your DVD, wires, charger etc etc. I returned this item after purchasing. I feel they should price this at less than 12$."
1,Too Small!,"Do not order this if you have a 7"" DVD player. I ordered the Phillips DCP 750 along with this case and the player DOES NOT fit in the case."
2,size,"I received this product, but when I tried to fit a DVD player 7"" is almost imposible to fit inside."
2,didn't fit,I bought this along with the Phillips DVD player. The player would not fit inside the case even though it waas recommended to purchase with the unit.
5,"High Cacao Content AND Good for Your Heart, You're A Winner!","Cheaper and with greater cacao content than the other product I've been buying, I'm now a Lindt customer. There is a big difference in flavor but that's due to the 85% cacao content so I'll have to forego my American sweet tooth and develop more of a sophisticated taste; if the Europeans can do it so can I! Join me, fight higher prices and become sophisticated at the same time, it's not hard. Beside, this stuff is good for your heart."
1,Tastes bad and gives me cramps,"As one reviewer said here, this used to be good but not anymore.I don't know what they started adding to this but it makes me sick.I won't go into details, but let's just say it's a real pain. In the guts.What a shame they took a good thing and ruined it.I only eat this sort of chocolate for the health benefits. Nothing relaxes thearteries and keeps the brain fed like cacao. Studies have shown benefits such askeeping the plaque off brain cells and staving off Alzheimer's.But I can no longer stomach this brand. I've never had such an intense stomach ache.I know it's not a chocolate intolerance since other brands don't do this to me.Whatever it is it is toxic to my insides.As far as taste goes, there are other brands that I like more. I'm not a fan of the way any of these intense dark chocolates taste but for the remarkable health benefits I eat a very small piece every day along with taking a daily asperin."
3,"really dark, but not tasty","really dark, but not tasty. it depends on your personal preference, some people might love it.first time to buy food online, little bit wired."
5,Lindt Extra Dark Choc.,"These chocolate bars are made with 85% extra dark chocolate. You have to acquire a taste for it because the darker the chocolate, the less sugar it contains. You have to acquire a taste for it because when you taste it for the first time, it has a slightly bitter taste. It took me less than a week to start enjoying the taste. Now, I find I don't care for regular chocolate because it's too sweet. It's also a much healthier chocolate to eat."
5,I love these bars,I have tried a lot of high cacao bars with low sugar. These taste the best to me. Also the 90% is my favorite. This is a good value if you buy 12 to a box.
3,Not Bad,"January 8 2013 at 12-17-53 PMYes it is 85% Cocoa, but the taste is not that bad, I did my research for Dark Chocolate, and the reviews on them. Some names come ahead and I will try them in the future, I will share with you my result in few hours of research:I did not try none of them yet, but I will soon:............. DO YOUR RESEARCH:-Scharffen Berger Semisweet Pure Dark-GOLD: Pacari Chocolate (Ecuador) – 70% Raw – Organic and Biodynamic-SILVER: Pacari Chocolate (Ecuador) – 70% Piura-Quemazon-SILVER: Amano Artisan Chocolate (United States) – Chuao 70% Dark Chocolate-Amedei CRU Mono Origin Venezuela 70% Extra Dark Chocolate-Green and Black’s Dark – 85% Cocoa-Ghirardelli Dark Chocolate-72% Godiva Chocolatier Dark-Cacao Reserve by Hershey’s Extra Dark"
5,Good Stuff,Tastes great. Really low sugar. So tastes really great given the low sugar content.What else is there to say?
3,Meh,"I didn't love this chocolate. I bought it to try as an alternative to Endangered Species 88% Extreme Dark because it contains a teeny bit of soy and I'm trying to avoid all soy. Compared to the latter, you can definitely taste the cocoa powder in this bar... tastes like hot cocoa in the back of my throat; not a bad thing necessarily just not a true and rich/ bitter dark chocolate. Probably more pleasing to the American palate, but I think I'll risk the 2% soy for the delicious taste of Endangered Species and cross my fingers that they'll eventually find an equally delicious formula sans soy!"
4,Good for making hot chocolate,"I use this for making hot chocolate and it is pretty good (3 squares, 2tbsp sugar, 1/4tsp salt, 1 mug of water heated on stove). Check the price in your grocery store, last time I bought this at my grocery store it was $2.50 per bar, which is a little less than the price per bar of this 12 pack at the time of this writing."
3,A Great Value -- But Not the Best Boris,"Boris is a work of incredible genius, and as other reviewers have noted, there is much to be said for purchasing this production:* It is beautifully staged, sung, and acted;* The disc is bargain priced;* It is the best recording of the Rimsky-Korsakov orchestration on the market.Unfortunately, it also has its limitations:* The sound quality is good but not really up to modern standards. The sound's limitations will be a serious problem if you have state-of-the art equipment. If, however, you're listening on your TV or through a simple stereo, you may not even notice it.* The visual quality while very good for its day is less than optimal. Again, with an old-style TV, this is not a problem. With HDTV you will be aware of it.* There are no captions.* This is only Rimsky's orchestration, not Mussorgsky's own.Most importantly, it does not compare with Kirov recording on Philips, either technically, dramatically, or as a musical performance."
1,Do Not buy this DVD,"This is a very poor copy of the 1978 Bolshoi performance on the Kultur label. The picture is blurry, the sound seems to come from underground. A shameful production."
4,A classic performance,"I have owned and enjoyed the VHS format of this performance for several years. I gladly would have replaced it with the DVD, but I understand there are no subtitles. That is truly inexcusable since they are there in the VHS. Nevertheless, the performance is grand in every sense of the word. The death scene as done by Nesterenko is absolutely breathtaking. I actually prefer the Mussorgsky version (Kirov/Gergiev) for many reasons, but I am still very happy to own this one."
4,Yet to read...,"Haven't read it yet, but my wife has. So I will give it 4 stars since she said it was good."
4,good read,"This is definitely a good read. It is a little sad, but very intriguing. I like the way it was written. It was not a scary book, a little creepy at times, but you can definitely turn the lights out after reading this one. It focuses more on seeking the cause behind the haunting. I really liked the family in the book as well, you did not get the impression that they were dysfunctional and seeking attention. I would recommend this one."
3,A bit disappointed,"I expected much more of a ""thrill"" from this story, based on the publicity. It has a great start and middle, but somehow trails off to a disappointing ending. You expect more ""punch"" at the end, but it never happens."
1,Night Stalks the Mansion,I did not read this book because it did not download completely. I couldn't figure how to re-download without paying for the book a second time.
2,SAME OLD SAME OLD,"This story has been told countless times.It has the same outcome as ""The Bell Witch""The rape and murder scenerio is a very convienient way to explain away a haunting. The book was a good read. I wasn't creeped out whatsoever. That was the biggest dissapointment."
4,Book Purchase,"I was pleased with this purchase of this book, 'Night Stalks The Mansion'. The book arrived in good shape, in the condition as described, and in a timely fashion. I use eBay quite a lot, but Amazon often has items that I cannot find elsewhere. I would certainly buy again from this seller on Amazon."
3,Not scary at all.,"This book disappointed me because it wasn't scary. I was actually so bored with it that I had to skip through it to find something good. I usually love true ghost stories and paranormal things. The parts that I did manage to read were really just about ""how"" the family dealt with the strange things that happened to them. If you like to get scared, skip this book. I heard they'll make a movie out of this book, so I'll probably still give it a chance by watching it."
4,Good Story,I liked this book. I found it very interesting and it was well written. People who like ghost stories and tv shows like the haunting (on discovery) and the haunted (on animal planet) will like this book.
4,Night Stalks the Mansion,Realistic view on living with Spirits and the investigation as to why they are still here. I really could not put this book down.
5,great book,"I have read this book many times, and it gets better every time. If you want to read a book that will keep you up to the wee hours, hearing every night noise in a new way, this is it."
5,Great Book,I really enjoyed this book. I kept my interest and gave me shivers a few times too. Worth your time to read!
4,page turner!,"I really enjoyed this story. It kept me interested and not bored. I did however, want more information regarding the history of the house. I have a lot of questions unanswered about the possible other ghosts and also about the crimes committed in the property. Who exactly was the women the dogs were barking violently at? Who was the man that came to the house when Carroll was alone in the house?This story is not scary but that depends on your own imagination. I really enjoyed the story and the way it was written. It did not drag.at the end i read something about a second book or a movie. I will definitely be interested in that."
4,A Good Read,"Devon Kerrich is handsome, wealthy, and extremely arrogant. Pamela Lockhart has a secret past and is covering up her true appearance with layers of cosmetics. Taking Queen Victoria's adivice, Kerrich adopts Elizabeth, an eight year old orphan. (The whole adopting an orphan for a good reputation, and wanting a boy, but getting a girl sounds eerily like ""Annie."") Of course he cannot take care of a child by himself so he hires a governess, who has to be old and unattractive. (This is where Pamela Lockhart comes in.) Kerrich is being blackmailed by the Queen and Pamela has a secret she shares with her. What happens? Buy the book and find out.The whole story comes together very nicely in the end. It was a good book overall."
2,A big disappointment,"I bought this book based on the high recommendations that I read here. I must admit, I was very disappointed!! The relationship between Pamela and Kerrich was not believable in a romantic way. It seemed like he went from being a big jerk to a sweet loving person. It just didn't seem right. Plus, I didn't even like Kerrich--he was rude, mean and not very noble. I realize that rakes are supposed to be a little bad but he was too much. He didn't have any respect for Pamela and she was just a little too rigid. I didn't enjoy the book. It had great potential but it wasn't what I expected."
3,Cute,"Beginning with this Rules of Engagement I became hooked on Ms. Dodd's Governess series. It is a pleasant read if you have some lazy hours to enjoy. I, became hooked on the series because I very much enjoyed the strength in Pamela's character. But I felt Kerrich was a weak hero because seriously why would a grown man care so much about a silly childhood incident that he'd alter his whole life in order to keep the incident a secret? I also felt the transformation from cold Kerrich to warm loving Kerrich was a bit too quick. But as i said earlier the book is a pleasant read, good for a bit of escapism if you will. ."
2,This is Jane Eyre&#65533;on crack,"It starts out okay. Pamela, an ambitious governess dresses as an older, uglier woman because the guy Devon doesn't want some the governess to lust after him. She's a funny creature, admonishing him as ""Young man"" and criticizing his ""animal tendencies"".The plot is a bit of a stretch. Why the hell did Devon get the idea that he would need to adopt an orphan to become respectable? I don't know. Devon's character includes affinity to children (did you expect anything less). Seems coincidental that all the leading men in romance books like children, eh?The real weakness is the orphan itself. Gosh, that annoying brat killed the heat, damnit! Of course that kiddo Elizabeth was liked by Devon.If you prefer the usage of office equipment for matter of consummation, well, here's a treat for you. But how they do it.. well, it made me skim and wish it was done quickly."
1,Very Bad Book!!!!!,This book is a pice of crap. Is a construction paper catalog with a few words!!!!
3,This movie was crazy and Where was Luke Goss!,"Don't buy this movie if you are looking for Luke Goss, he will not be in this movie no more then twice and he was the reason why I bought this movie. This movie was not what I expected .It should have been called Crazy Love Life, because it was some crazy things that was going on in this movie. I did not like when the two guys was naked around that little baby girl.I love Luke Goss even the small part he played. The over all movie was crazy.If you like crazy and confusing and flipped out stuff then this is your movie."
5,wonderful scent,"I searched 20 years to find a scent that wouldn't upset my allergies. I just wish they made a perfume too.I have to be content with the eau de cologne, soap, bath gel, and body creme."
3,Great Potential & Poor Production,"This cd could have been twice as good as it is if these guys would hire a bass player and upgrade there recording production. Half of the songs are ""tinny"" and are definetly lacking a bass line to drive the melody's. These guys have got potential though. There music is kinda alt-blues-rocky. They are somewhat trying to come off as 'White Strip-ish"" with the guitar,drum, no bass gig. It works ok on 1/2 the songs, but the other half aren't all that good with this kind of set up. There are 5 or 6 decent songs, and the rest are below average. Three stars tops.Gary Allen"
4,I like it,"I am a fan of Roy Z's music and thought to fill it out with this album. The songs are fun and happy and the guitar playing is completely different from the other work of his I was exposed to (w/ Bruce Dickinson). It has been described as Santana-esque. I think that is a bit of a stretch, but it does have some latin-ish rhythms which add to the fun factor."
2,No Banks? Santo? Williams? Jenkins? How about Hartnett?,"I was very interested in this DVD until I discovered, much to my dismay, that there were no games from the '69 team - nor '45! No wonder the GREAT Ron Santo has been kept out of the HOF! These young pup sportswriters never SAW him play! We need a decent DVD with the earlier years... with Billy Williams, Ron Santo and Randy Hundley, Fergie Jenkins and Jim Hickman, Gabby Hartnett's ""Homer in the Gloamin'"" and Grover Alexander, Jimmy Foxx and Rogers Hornsby, and never, never forget ""Kessinger to Beckert to Banks!!! Kenny Holtzman's no-hitter? Or Milt Pappas' no-hitter? Ernie's 500 HR? There is soooo much missing here!"
4,"Cubs fans, rejoice","If you're a die-hard Chicago Cubs fan, you are required to own this DVD set. Sadly, it's sorely lacking on game footage of legends like Ernie Banks, Ron Santo and Billy Williams, and the bonus features come up a little short, but the complete broadcast games featuring the 1989 and '84 playoffs (the good games -- the wins) is great stuff. Plus, Steve Bartman is nowhere to be found in the entire set, although the 1998 one-game playoff win over the Giants would have been a nice addition."
1,Over price rip off,I think it's in very poor taste to price a kids toy at $200. They sell for $19.99. Yes they are sold out at the moment. However this is just like the monster high craze. Pricing like this is the same as when people were gas gauging. You should be ashamed at yourself.
2,Mac Users: included backup software is very slow,"This drive works well enough as a plain old drive but the Mac software for backups (MaxBack) is terrible -- it takes days and days to back up about 270 gb of data, usually it hangs somewhere during the process. Their tech support so far has not offered a solution."
1,Failure to operate,"The Maxtor came recommended, but the software on mine seemed to be corrupted, and it was returned. It was replaced with a different model."
1,Not a good backup solution,I have three major gripes.1-It is sloooow. Even though it has Fire wire/Usb2.0 (bursts) it takes forever for the backup interface to open.2- As mentioned already in previous reviews it does not back-up system files nor will it back up all my folders in My documents. Not sure why. The back-up interface is too simplistic and doesn't have many options.3-It's noisy. Grinds and sounds like my old SCSI HDD.I wished I had read more reviews before I purchased this drive.
2,Won't back up your system files!,"I was initially happy with this product after seeing the new software that came with it. The old Retrospect Express software that came with my OneTouch II 200 GB was lousy and unintuitive. The Maxtor Backup software that came with this 300GB drive seemed much more intuitive. However, not only is it extremely unresponsive but it does not backup things like program files and your operating system. Tech support said it's not ""designed for this,"" and suggested I use other software if I want to back up my system! So, apparently it's fine for backing up regular files and documents, but if you want to recover your system after a crash you're out of luck. There should be a clear notice on the product. False advertising."
2,Warning for Mac OSX users,"The software on this drive doesn't work. I spent an hour on the phone with Maxtor customer service and they couldn't solve it. The drive works as a simple backup for important data but their Retrospect Express, the software which performs the automated backups, synchronization, etc.) doesn't work. If you want a simple drive with extra space where you drag and drop data to be saved, this is a nice drive to have but forget the automating features."
5,So far so good,"I just purchased this hard drive, setup was very easy, with a quick start manual that explained everything that I needed to be concerned with. I use it with OSX so you have to format it to begin with since it's formatted for a PC out of the box, however it was no problem. One touch backup works as advertised, and this drive is pretty quiet with no overheating issues so far."
1,Broke down within couple of weeks,"Got it a couple of weeks ago, after seeing its good reviews.Worked great for a couple of weeks..I filled it with 200GB of backups and music. Yesterday it broke down, despite having a power surge protector. It looked like power issue, as I heard a sound...while running and my OS no longer could see the USB drive.The most unfortunate thing is that Seagate provides no free data recovery services, even under warranty...they can only replace...which is really bad...their data recovery services are priced/charged based on data size recovered...i think.Luckily, I did not erase all the source data...just lost about 1GB in all...trying to recover it through data recovery services...but this really is bad. Looks like seagate does not care about maxtor products...as they offer exchanges for defective maxtor products under warranty by new maxtor drives or OLD refurbished seagate drives."
2,Works great... Until it doesn't.,"So I've had mine for about six or seven months, and was completely happy until it died! It seems like that's the consensus of these reviews, people are satisfied with the Maxtor until it suddenly stops working, and then they're very unhappy, as I am. I plan on contacting the new owners of Maxtor and trying to get it replaced, but from reading other people's reviews I probably won't get any of that data back!"
2,GAS & GAFFS,"It's a GAS fireplace...need I say more?Actually, yes, someone in the background dropped something, the microphone probably. GAS, I couldn't believe it!!! When I want a fireplace, I want a real fire, dagnabbit."
5,Worth the money,"It appeared to me to be a real, woodburning fire. There is a clunk sound in the middle of the tape, but if you watch the screen, you'll see it's just the logs collapsing. I was very pleased with the video. It's just a burning fire, viewed from various angles. I like it."
5,Powerful,"It is a compelling story about a fire and it's quest to remain lit while in its home, a fire place."
5,A Hero's Journey,"Mary Gordon's Final Payments is a great American Novel. Through her tale of a girl from Queens, the reader is taken on the classical hero's journey. Written in a voice as honest as Isak Denisin's and with insights on mortality as powerful as Virginia Woolf's, readers reckon with the narrator as they come to terms with themselves. The result is powerfully redemptive and enormously healing."
4,"Insightful, brave, witty, passionate...","Final Payments is an insightful look at love, death, friendships, and religion. Mary Gordon writes with such richness it is a beauty to read. Her style of writing is truly an art. She creates absorbing characters with such depth, especially Isabel Moore. Isabel manages to touch us with nearly every emotion: sadness, sympathy, happiness, frustration, relief, and humor. Her thoughts are so unique, so inspiring. It's an amazing first novel, and definitely worth a read. Since there is no synopsis given at Amazon.com, I thought I'd provide a brief look at the back of the book: ""After eleven years of devotion to her father, Isabel Moore suddenly finds herself with what most of us dream of: a chance to create a totally new existence. She is supported by the loving encouragement of two old school friends, rapidly becomes involved with two men -- and then discovers that before she can grasp the present she must make her final payments to the past."""
3,New USA Geography,Elizabeth Adler and her editor need a quick review course in USA geography!!! This happens when the young Ed Vincent goes over the mountain from Tennessee to South Carolina. How did that happen?
1,Boring!,I gave up on this one when the old woman was brought into the story (I think I managed to read about 130 pages). I just got to the point where I was so bored with this book that I didn't even care what happened to these people anymore. This was my 1st E. Adler book and will probably be my last.
2,Disappointing,"Vanguard Visionaries is an extraordinarily disappointing series, given that the label is being so stingy with its offerings. The label has an excellent roster. If they wanted to publicise their archives, they could have been a great deal more generous at this price - or else offered it for $6 or so. It's also disappointing that Vanguard is ignoring some of the wonderful stuff in its archives and focusing instead on meaningless releases of this variety - the ""greatest hits"" by the same artists, on the same label, are a much better deal."
2,Lots of pictures-lack of info,"This is basically a picture book. the ideas are pretty conventional as far as fireplaces go. I bought this book for inspiration on a project that I have recetnly started for a client that was looking to update an existing fireplace in her 100+ year old Victorian. She was looking for fresh/ ideas, something to compliment the mix of historic and contemporary details throughout the interior.. I did not find anything of value from this book for this particular project. As far as design ideas go, this a meat and potatos book."
4,A mystical relation to self,"It is obvious what the text CLOUDSTREET has to say about family relationships and the need for experience in life and understanding, but reading beneath the texts obvious words are themes which are somewhat covered by the more obvious way of life of the Pickles and the Lambs. To discover the truth about both the families and also about yourself, you need to search beyond the texts simple themes and discover the true meanings for yourself. Such as the themes of spirituality and dependence discussed in the book. To talk more on this subject, please feel free to e-mail me today and we can have brainstormes on the deeper and truer meanings of Wintons epic novel, Cloudstreet.Funky_gal@playful.com"
5,Winton Very convincing.,"This book is inspiring. It channels the journey of an emotionaly disturbed man, Fish, who is in his own world. His family, and their saga is explored deeply and meaningfully as well."
5,"How Do I Love Thee, Let Me Count the Ways...","Heehee... Fires of Heaven is my (current) favorite WOT book, for so many reasons. So many turning points, wished for moments, and character awesomeness. That's true of the rest of the series, but this one grabs me more."
3,"Lets be honest, you're here because you're a fan",Is it great? No. But it connects some plot points for the series readers. It's painful in many parts but if you want the full story you have to trudge through this dead space to get there
2,The Downward Spiral Begins,"The first three books were entertaining fantasy. In the second three books in this series, the author abandons his principles and decides that making money is much more important than telling a good story. There are still brief sections with rousing action and interesting plot developments, but the direction of the plot is no longer towards resolution. The series has rather entered a holding patterns with new characters and new sub-plots introduced with the aim of dragging the series out. And boy, does it start to drag. The Wheel of Time series enters a downward spiral in books three through six from which it never recovers."
2,Pages missing,"The third book, ""Lord of Chaos"" is missing the final chapter.The Wheel of Time (Boxed Set #3)"
4,A very good series.... Definitely needs closure,I've read a few books in my time. WOT is definitly one of the best. It is starting to drag out however. I hope RJ realizes this very soon.
5,Wow,"Haven't had a decent night's sleep since I started the series due to not being able to put the thing down....The Wheel of Time Series is truly remarkable. From the simple things such as ""seeing"" the characters grow, to the subtle hints on future events, to the way the pieces of the puzzle seem to ""click""."
5,Absoluty Wonderful,I've been reading Fantasy for over 20 years and I found that this series is the best so far. It is fasinating and the characters are all very strong. You will be brought into a world of wonder where at least one of the characters will take hold of you and change you into him or her.A must read
1,Fell apart,"As soon as I took this out of the box it fell apart. I had to glue it back together and I'm so carefull with it because I""m scared it's going to fall apart again. Also it's not very high inside so if you have dividers they are all to tall and you haev to cut them down."
5,Koolest CD ever,This is my favorite of all the Nuwine CDs. Everytime I get in the car its on. Whats great about all this is that my kids listen to it too!
3,"Nice, But!","If you are buying an Cannon EOS camera the next grade up of Speedlites, the ones with ""EX"" on the end of the number have far more features then this does. This worked fine for a simple ""brighter flash"". The higher cost units have higher intigration with the EOS product that make them worth the money. So if you are like me and did not do your home work first, go do it now. If you know what you are doing this is a great product and will do only what it is designed to do."
4,"Simple, cheap, good","I have used this flash for the past 7 years and it had never given me a bit of trouble. Granted it only has an on/off switch and a ready light, but the camera does everything else. Is it worth the price? Yes. Have I ever wished I had bought the more expensive flash? Rarely, when I am shooting at a distance at night. Otherwise, it fills my needs."
4,Canon Speedlite 200E Flash,"The flash works great. There is a little lag time waiting for it to be ready, but the pictures are worth the wait."
2,DESCRIPTION IS FALSE!,"I bet this works on many camera's and is great, but not on mine, I took it to a camera store and everything, but is NOT functional with all Canon EOS camera's. I have a 400D(Reebel XTi) and it didn't work, other flashes did though, and the guy at the shop said it isn't compatible with all camera's, so make sure it works!!!"
3,Basic Flash,"Here you have the Likes and Don't Likes.Like:A lot of flash, you have to compensate on manual mode.Light.Don't Like:Basic on/off switch.No way to decrease the power of the flash on the unit."
2,Contemporary = Banal,"I was interested in taking a course using this textbook. I ordered the book. I returned the book. I am not taking the course.The authors may be excellent organizers. The book has plenty of structure with this indentation of one type related to that indentation of another type. The problem is the prose. Like Chinese food served in Montana, the prose lack zest. Classical mythology, my main interest, is full of passion; the authors have sucked the passion out of the stories.And one other thing, Star Wars is not myth in any sense that makes myth interesting."
3,little over used,"We found that the book was a little too used, with a lot of highlights and hand written notes...but the price was good"
5,One of my favourite albums,"Listening to this album, it is not difficult to tell where Pink Floyd gained some of its unique sound from. Aside from that, there are lots of great songs on here showcasing David's brilliant musicianship. The title track features a truly style-defining guitar solo, whereas tracks like ""Then I Close My Eyes"" and ""Take A Breath"" are particularly well-arranged. Other more straight-forward songs like ""This Heaven"" and ""Smile"" also add to the album's feeling of overall peace and comfort. The closing track ""Where We Start"" is a wonderful ode to growing old with a significant other.This is not Pink Floyd, it's David Gilmour, who is a great musician in his own right and proves here that he does not need any help from his fellow band mates to create a brilliant album of good music, although he did not mind having Richard Wright play on a few of the tracks."
2,minimal minimilistic,"David didn't get it right on the first cd and and took a ""trip""on the second compliments of Trainspotting!!!!!!(You decide)!"
1,You have to be stubborn to finish this book,"In Maine, as I write this, it is ""Mud Season"", which was an appropriate time, as it turned out, for me to read Dark Lady. It appears that Richard North Patterson is going through his Mud Season period with this effort. I agree with those that point out that he is unable to write convincingly in the mind of a woman. I agree with those who have said that the plot of this book is confusing at times; that the characters are not fleshed out and in the end you really don't give a damn about Stella or the problems and issues she is dealing with. In a word, it is a tedious read. I have usually enjoyed this writer. Many of his earlier novels were first rate, but this is not one of them. I hope that the next effort will be more succesful and that he gets back to the type of writing he is clearly capable of."
2,A Lot of Navel Gazing Before We get To The Real Story,The protagonist spends a long time reliving her past in the Polish section of Somerset (Cleveland) before we get to really solving the central crimes. She is a senior assistant DA with political amibitions and I was beginning to think I was reading an Advise and Consent scaled down for Northest Ohio before we got down to actual crime solving. Once the author did it was a pretty good story. It just took way too long to get started. The author is well know and most of his works are best sellers so this can't be typical of his work.
4,Good but not Great,This book was enjoyable reading even though some parts dragged out more than necessary. The cast of characters were somewhat confusing but it was all brought together nicely in the end. There were some interesting twists and story lines within the book.
1,The Wrongful Dedication,"With mediocre editorial and customer reviews, I bought this book with hopes of being surprised. I did not get past the dedication page. George Bush...please! Anyone want a brand new copy? It is so near the trash; however, I have never thrown away any book, regardless of how bad it was. This one breaks the streak."
3,average for patterson,"Patterson has the unique ability to make the reader care about the chapter he is reading alone by itself. I found myself reading because I wanted to see what happened next, even though the climax wasn't for another 200 pages. Patterson makes the characters interesting and constantly reveals new info which makes each part of the book valuable. Unfortunately the deep mysteries or tragedies that haunt some of the characters turn out to be much more minor than one would expect.This is a good story, although Patterson does like to write about twisted sex a lot."
2,A Disappointment,"Glad I got this one from the rental rack at the library! No courtroom drama, characters you don't care much about, and predictable local ""intrigue"" all make for a disappointing read. Hardly what I expected from the author of Degree of Guilt and Silent Witness. Too bad."
2,Unrealized potential,"The title should be ""Dark Novel."" The characters are generally not likable, even the protagonist. For much of the book, you will say ""Who cares?"" At other times, you'll say ""I don't believe that."" I have not been a HUGE Patterson fan, but even I was surprised and how much I disliked this book. The plot line explaining the crimes makes some sense, but several of the details and the buildup will leave you shaking your head. Silent Witness is a better alternative."
2,Not his best,"The book has all the variables of a Patterson book, but it doesn't jell. It does not have any of the i-have-to-keep-reading stuff of his past books. I wish it had started 2/3 through."
2,Read Better,"This book started out slow -- petty politics and not really understanding who the players are and how they are related. Story pick's up about half-way through for about 70 pages or so, and then down hill again. You are left with the feeling, who cares and what did all this mean? Why was this story interesting to us? Die hard fans will probably still enjoy this book, but after No Safe Place and this one, I don't plan on picking up another hard back of his soon."
2,so-so,"I've read a couple of Richard North Patterson novels and have enjoyed them. I'm on page 213 right now and I'm having trouble getting through it. I really enjoy the scenes where you can gain insight into the characters (like Stella's past,etc.). Patterson is excellent when it comes to getting inside of the characters. But, the political and legal babble is BORING, BORING, BORING. This book would be great if they weren't building a baseball stadium:-)"
2,Am I missing something?,"Again, I was greatly disappointed with this book as I was with Patterson's A Safe Place. I used to love his books, but I am bored beyond belief now. Am I the only one who has seen the change in his writing! I long for another Silent Witness. I doubt if I will buy another of his books."
2,As entertaining as watching paint dry.,"I can't wrap my brain around that RNP actually wrote this book. It's slow, boring, and hard to follow. I bought this book because I really liked Stella marz from Silent Witness, but to be honest, she doesn't seem anything like the character RNP created in Silent Witness. Overall, take a pass on this snoozer."
2,Hard for me to follow,"I did manage to read the entire book but had difficulty making all the connections between different characters. Maybe it was just me but there is a possibility it was also the plot.....In case you find yourself not understanding what is going on, just keep plugging along as it all does come together eventually."
2,"Doesn't hold together, far from Patterson's best","Hey I love Cleveland and wanted to love this book. But the mob/big money/politics connection is about as obvious and hackneyed as plot devices come. Also the key clue that finally pulls everything together is laughably convenient and unbelievable. And why is Marz the one who finds this all important clue? No cop or homicide detective would have found it before her. Come on... The surprising best part here is the love story betwen Marz and her little helper. If it weren't for that, the book would fall completely flat."
1,Where's the Suspense?,"I found the book to be slow, the characters to be uninteresting. The book seems to be more of a character book, with characters that one does not care about, than a mystery. It totally lacks suspense! The only reason I was determined to finish is that I paid for it. If I had checked it out of the library, it would have been returned months ago."
2,Disappointed But Still A Patterson Fan,"I have enjoyed everything that I have read by Patterson. When I bought Dark Lady, I also bought Patterson's latest novel, Protect and Defend. I couldn't put Protect and Defend down until I finished it. I have struggled for almost a month to finish Dark Lady. Dark Lady is suspiciously like a John Grisham novel instead of a Robert North Patterson novel. If I had wanted Turow or Grisham, I would have bought Turow or Grisham. If I want Patterson, I want to see the sophistication that I saw in No Safe Place, Protect and Defend and Final Judgment. I haven't found that high quality in Dark Lady. I am a little embarrassed to be writing about a novel I couldn't finish. But what is it they say about a new pair of shoes? If the shoes don't fit well when you buy them they probably never will. Alas, I fear this book won't get any better. I regret having to say that since I enjoy Patterson so much. Dark Lady is not a keeper in that fine Patterson tradition."
2,Just promotes seterotypes !,I read Silent Witness by JNP and loved it so I moved on to this one. Boy what a waste of my time. The story moved S L O W. First of all it gives the impression that the construction industry is just ripe with scandels and corruption. I work for one of the oldest land developers in the nation and am here to tell you that is just not true. It seems to be the reputation that the industy has gotten over time but it is not the norm. Another thing I was offened by was that MBEs just show up to collect a paycheck and not to work - once again FALSE.I think the book does more to promote sterotypes than to entertain.
3,Lack of action,"Mr. Patterson spends far too much time developing the characters, not enough chasing clues, suspects, interviewing."
3,"Good, not great","The story is gripping, thanks in large part to the meticulous background information about Steeltown. I thought this gave the story dimension. Yes, the crimes are especially brutal, but they make sense within the context of the story -- where public perception is often more important than reality. My only reservation with the book is the character of Stella. For a woman who has been around crime, drugs and murder throughout her entire highly-successful career, she acts pretty stupidly when her own life and safety are concerned. I don't want to be a spoiler who gives away important plot points, but let's just say she doesn't respond to personal threats the way a seasoned officer of the court should"
2,Very Disappointed,"I really like this author, and that's why I was very disappointed in this book. It took me way too long to finish it because it takes over 200 pages to even begin to grab you. And even then it's a flaccid grab. The story-building goes on forever, and I kept wondering when this was going to kick into a higher gear. Definitely not a keeper, and extremely forgetable."
1,"After all of his other great reads, a major letdown.","If you are a fan or Richard North Patterson, as am I, save yourself the money and more importantly the time. He attempts, and fails, at writing a darker tail of deceipt. His fictional town of Steeltown is contrived and not at all believable. His plot is disjointed and his characters belong in Greek tragety. Go back to San Francisco Mr. Patterson and leave the dark Rust Belt for more accomplished writers like John Updike. Stick to your knitting. We would all be much happier."
1,Frustrating Disappointment,"I have read and enjoyed all of RNP's books, and was thrilled to trip over this one, which I had not read. What a letdown. I am on page 90, and have decided to give up on it. It has been a real chore to get this far, and I feel that if I dread picking up a book and read it out of some sort of misplaced duty, it's time to give up on it. (I've only given up on two books before--Hunt for Red October, because there was too much technical stuff and I ended up tossing it across the room, and Turow's Pleading Guilty for much the same reason I don't like this one.) The character development just doesn't happen. I don't care what happens to any of them, another good reason not to finish a book."
2,disappointing,"For me, this was definitely a book I could put down and I did - often. Although well written, I would never recommend this book as a 'good read'. I had no empathy with the main character and the book was slow moving and unexciting. I give it two stars as at least I managed to finish it."
2,Dark Lady,I am always anxiously awaiting Richard North Pattersons new books and courtroom drama. This one was difficult to finish. Uninteresting and uneventful. I'll look forward to the next one but I hope he returns to his satisfying and suspenseful style of old.
2,This book is very lightweight compared to his others.,After reading DARK LADY I felt very relieved that it had finally come to an end. I have read many of Mr. Patterson's books and hated to get to the last page (The biggest compliment one can give a good mystery.) This was just a chore. Sorry Mr. P!
4,Dark Lady offers both political and legal plot,"A good combination of two of my favorite storylines -- law and politics -- Dark Lady offers a number of challenges for title character Stella Marz. She is faced with being true to her profession, boss and former friend, while ensuring responsibility to the people she is to serve as a member of the prosecutor's office. As if this isn't enough, she must temper how her investigation and actions will affect her boss' run for mayor and her own personal political aspirations. A great book for students of the politics vs. public service debate, and an excellent selection for anyone looking for a ""who-done-it"" mystery."
5,Could Not Put It Down,"Although this is not a short book, I read it all in one sitting. Could not stop. It's great reading, interesting plot and believeable characters. Although I am not usually a mystery/thriller fan, I really enjoyed this book. It was well-written and assumed that the reader could comprehend above a 6th. grade reading level."
4,Worth The Wait!,"I was eager to read the book, and it was well worth the wait. Well written with a good plot. Richard North Patterson is an excellent writter whose books simply get better and better."
3,Not up to par with his other books,"Dark Lady was a bit of a disappointment. Richard North Patterson is my favorite author, and I always wait eagerly for his books, but this one didn't do much for me. Most of it was very boring. I couldn't identify (or care about) any of the characters."
5,"Make the effort, it's worth your time.","This book is worth your time. It's only complicated because people are complicated, to write them any other way would be a waste of time. So many twists and turns, Patterson should never be taken for granted. Make the effort, then look at the people who surround your everyday life and realize, you never know...."
3,Buy Mission X instead!,"The only good songs are ""24/7"" and ""Mean Streets"". Which are included in the Album Mission X. The song ""Hardcore Lover"" could been better but you won't spent alot time listenning to it. The rest I just didn't like it. The songs ""Number for a Number"" and ""Scream Killers"" don't have the energy put into them as the songs ""24/7"" and ""Mean Streets"". I find myself listenning to ""24/7"" and ""Mean Streets"" over and over again. The multimedia is just four wallpapers for your computer. All four have the same picture but with different sizes. The picture is the same one as in the front cover of 24/7.Edit: In the editorial review is stated that, the video for 'Meanstreets' is included. This is apparently missing from my CD. No where in the inserts is stated that the video for 'Meanstreets' is included. Rather it says that, ""multimedia extras"" are included."
3,Cumplidor,Este mini CD cumple con las espectativas del que fue el X disco de U.D.O. Lo recomiendo solo para fanaticos del mensionado artista. Para el resto de metaleros compren el disco X y con eso tendran suficiente.
4,QUICK EVALUATION OF PRODUCT,"I LIKED THE FEEL OF THE PRODUCT. I WAS AMAZED AT HOW WELL IT STEADIED MY VIEWING AREA. THE EXTERNAL FEEL OF THE PRODUCT WAS GREAT, NOT TO HEAVY AND MY HANDS DID NOT SLIDE, I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN A GOOD FIRM GRIP ON IT."
3,Canon IS 12x36 binoculars,While I agree that the binoculars can be adjusted to fit different individuals the range of adjustment is too small and will NOT accomodate some women and alsmost all children.
3,"Great performance, poor paint job","The paint came off the high-heat areas on the first use and began to rust overnight. I had to wire brush, sandpaper, and repaint with high-temp paint. Other than that, no problems. Burner performs great; have used it many times with no issues."
5,Excellent teaching tool,"I teach Army Officer Candidates and have used this excellent guide twice. To say there is ""lots of good stuff"" here is an understatement. The various sections give good background on Civil War tactics and weapons. My students especially enjoyed the ""animated battle"" which traced/showed the battles chronological progress. The 360 degree panorama views were also very nice.Using the Guide my students were able to conduct better briefs, and also ask intelligent questions of our guide.Because of the way I use the Expedition Guide, the only addition I would make to the Guide would be the use of topographical maps as the topography was extremely important in this battle. I have made this suggestion to the authors, and they have already made the change to future editions of the Guide."
5,Great tour guide,"I have been to Gettysburg a number of times. Watching the movie beforehand and using the audio CDs as our battlefield tour guide made this my best experience by far. Providing the big picture that led to the battle is helpful, but the personal stories of individuals in both armies made it meaningful. I was very pleased with the whole experience."
1,Only works with windows 98,"If you have an old pc that has windows 98 then you can use this game. It won't work with 2000, xp, or windows 7"
2,Not really very good.,"The best thing that I can say about this book is that, unlike many mass-market genre paperbacks, there aren't a whole lot of typos and other sloppy editing mistakes in it. There are a couple, but not enough to complain about. And the characters are resonably, if not exceptionally, well-handled.Unfortunately, the basic plot is silly, it is handled poorly, and resolved in a very unsatisfactory way. Granted, it isn't the worst Star Trek novel I've read -- not by a long shot -- but it's definitely in the bottom third. I wouldn't bother with it unless you're just desperate for a Star Trek novel and the only other ones handy that you haven't read are ones that I've given one-star reviews to; there are a few of those."
3,A Quark DS9 novel.,"Although Sisko and O'Brien are on the cover, this DS9 novel is about the trials and errors of Quark. Greed and the need for more profit are the evils which bring about the plot of this novel.Although not the best of the DS9 novels, a definate must for Quark fans."
3,Aliens mad at Quark,Quark gets in trouble for trying to broker to a race that is on bad terms with another race. A third race is mad at the other two. Sort of predictable.
1,a yawner.........,"Had hoped for much more... it's the type of book that sets up the conflict for 200 pages, massages it for 60 more, and then resolves it in only 10!! VERY unsatisfying ending."
2,this book is awful!,"you'll never get past page 100. this book is simply unreadable. after reading a few chapters, you'll find that you've learned a lot, but understand very little. and certainly won't be able to DO anything with it. the book is guilty (amoung other things) of giving VERY technical definitions which is fine, but no attempt is made to give a better understanding of the term in basic, frank language that everyone can understand. in addition, the book is way too long. it attempts to be a treatiste on the subject of xlib. if you want to learn xlib (or anything, for that matter), you want a basic book, not a treatiste."
3,A good compiler,This compiler is a very good one. I have been looking for a good one latly and it was the best! I use this compiler everyday now i love it.
5,"Great Product, Great Price!","I used to use GNC's brand, this is a better value! Does the same job, wouldn't live without it!"
3,Ehhhh,I am not too crazy about this product yet. I have not been taking it long enough to make a well determined call on if it is working or not yet.
3,chitosan,I have to say that I haven't really used this prduct as of yet.Going to give it a good try.
1,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your money on this - just no effect from this at all. Probably more of a placebo than an actually 'working' product.
2,Chitosan 500mg caps,"Honestly I can't tell any difference or any results to my body since taking them. While I am sure they are not harmful, they really don't seem very helpful either!"
4,"Good, but with features not everone will appreciate","Surely a very nice edition. Potential buyers should however know that the text is in ""manuscript"" style , i.e. it has no ""critical aparatuses"" and ""no breathing marks, accents, punctuation, paragraphing, capitalization, or diacritical marks""! (Quoted from the preface.)"
1,rilly bad,this book stank. it is rilly rilly bad. read star wars novels they are better trek is cool to thow
3,"Helpful, but many errors?","I found the set up of this book very helpful, they break down the math sections well and provide drills. But alot of the answers are not correct. I would recommend not relying on the drills because the answer key is screwed up. When you already struggle in math, a faulty answer key is the last thing you need for your confidence level. But, I did read through the book, using the review sections and ignoring the answer keys.If REA fixed the answer keys, then this would be a really great book."
5,Math Builder - A Great review of the basics,"This book was great for a review on all the major topics covered on the GMAT test. Gives you a brief tutoring on the topic and then pleanty of practice problems covering what they just talked about. Most other review products that I have seen out there don't give you that many (or give you far too few to none at all) practice problems on the topic or covered. Most give you a test question and then cover the answer, nothing more. If you are like me you want a review of it all. You get a good review and practice with the Math Builder. VERY GOOD!!!!! Thanks REA!!!!!"
3,cat friendly,"has helped decrease itching and scratching, but not completely. altough, it is very animal safe and environmentally friendly."
3,For an art class,"I liked my other book i got for the class more, but this one was okay, compared it. I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Great Lessons for Beginners,"I have been wanting to develop my hand drawing skills so I purchased this book based on the recommendation of my professor. I have worked through the lessons in several chapters and really feel like my drawing skills have increased as a result.The author writes in a really clear, approachable way about the process of drawing - how to draw what you see and not what you think you see. He talks openly about the challenges of drawing and how you have to train your eye - it's not a skill you either have or don't have. That was encouraging for me to read and I am excited to work through the rest of the book as time allows. Great resource for anyone wanting to develop their hand skills!"
5,Keys to Drawing and Seeing,"This book tells us the importance of seeing rather than drawing. In most cases the how-to book tells only about the methods, but such methods will not keep overnight. But the author of this book knows the real nature of drawing, so he advises us to draw without watching. This is the wonderful book !"
4,Good book....,This book is good for the beginner and maybe even intermediate artist. May even be a reference for a more advanced artist. Will keep this in my library of art instruction books. Has many projects and exercises to do with helpful hints and evaluations.
5,Excellent Book,This book contains a wealth of information and many excellent exercises on improving your drawing skills. Probably one of the best on the market for the beginner to intermediate artist. You will definitely be improved and have a much greater understanding of techniques and styles after going through the lessons in this book. Highly recommended!
4,A Little More Positive Than.....,"Hey, I liked the fact that Mr. Slater tried to mix things up a bit. Yes, he took some risks outside the usual norm that didn't always flow, but overall this one kept me interested. I listen to it plenty."
2,Slate not Clean,"I give enough respect to Mr. Slater for doing this fabric mix. He had a few good songs on here, even for running. However, I cannot even give it three stars and say anything else good about it. Picture entering a bar with heavy smoke and just hearing fast techno. With hearing this, it is not quite what I would call compiled right. I'll hear 4 or 5 good songs on hear, but it does not have a consistant beat with songs that make nearly half this fabric boring. This is boring where I would be more amuzed watching grass grow.I am not a Luke Slater fan. However, this disc doesn't clean the slate to call it a real fabric mix!!"
3,"Some great tracks, but loses steam halfway through.","This is one of those top heavy mixes, where it seems most of the good flow of tracks are in the first half. The second half, while having some decent tracks scattered through, are cluttered with too many mediocre or weak ones. The first part of the mix is a stunning line-up of high energy techno, only to be brought down by the last half. It's a shame the flow couldn't continue, as I really like a majority of what's on here."
4,IS makes a world of difference!,"Without the IS system, I can only look through these things for a few minutes before my trembling hands have me nauseous. But the IS allows me to look through these as long as I can support them. Like another reviewer, I find I have to fold down the eye cups for a better view.I fail to understand why Canon can't include a cover for the objective lenses, particularly at this price tag. Aside from that, the only complaint worth mentioning is that they are rather heavy, and you won't be pointing these at the sky for too long without a tripod or something supporting your elbows.If you can afford them and don't mind a little weight, you will be pleased."
3,Canon Imagd Stabilizing binoculars - 15x50.,Already had the Canon IS 10x30 and loved them. Wanted a second with more power. This is not significantly better. It is also extremely heavy and hard to hold when looking at objects. I don't know if there is something in between that Canon makes that would be easier to use. Maybe I need to go to the gym and get bigger biceps !
3,The Eye Cups are TERRIBLE....,"Recent purchase of these. Either the eyecups will hopefully soften up, or I will get callouses on the bridge of my nose. Super stiff, and too large a diameter eyecups. Come on Canon... don't you listen to the feedback of all the people complaining about the eyecups on these?The image stabilization is nice, makes a big difference, too bad I am also focusing on the pain from the eyecups.I went into this purchase knowing the eyecups and eye-relief issues were there... so I am hoping to figure someway to improve on this. I did find some websites that show different ways to improve/replace these eyecups, nothing too easy though since it appears that the eyecups are mounted quasi-permanently to the binoculars."
5,Owned a pair for 3 years now,Great optics. Surprisingly bright and excellent for star gazing. I can actually see the moons of Jupiter with them.Issues- Protective caps don't stay on.. ever- Sucks up batteries pretty quickly- A bit heavyStill 5 stars. One of my all-time favorite expensive purchases.
3,Canon 18x50 Image Stabilizatoin binoculars,I bought the Canon 18x30 IS to identify ducks on my lake at 360-400 feet. Side by side comparison with the Canon 10x30 shows no improvement. It was a serious letdown. It appears the water surface is too dark to allow seeing what kind of duck it is. My 14 year old Tasco 10x50 that isn't good enough is why I bought the Canon's so I don't need two pair that aren't good enough. I am returning the Canons.When used to view the moon or objects well lit then there is a slight improvement over the Canon 10x30 but not worth twice the price in my opinion.The small end lens caps almost always pops off putting it back into the case. I thought I could live with no lens cap over the large end but after using them for two days and taking them out in my boat it is a constant worry I will scratch the lens. I saw reviews you can buy screw in lens covers. My thoughts are for $1300 you should have lens caps for both ends and they should stay on when placed on the binoculars.
3,Great except for rubber eye cups!,"I love these binoculars -- they do everything they promiseand the performance is spectacular. My only complaint isthat the rubber eyecups are furiously uncomfortable. Iguess I have deep eye-sockets. The eye-relief is much toomuch which greatly reduces my field of view and I findmyself smashing my eyes against the cups. The cups are toolarge in diamater to fit comfortably against my eyes. If Iroll the cups down, the rolled down portion of the cups isvery thick and I can't get my nose between the eyepieces...Haven't found any sort of replacement -- may start hacking withscissors soon!"
3,Canon 18x50 - IS All-Weather Binoculars,"I just bought these Canon binoculars 18-50 at Amazon.Com. Optically they are fantastic and I would rate them with 5 stars..but for the following poor design issues.When using the holding strap it can and will damage the rubber eye pieces.Canon designers put no thought into this.The front lenses are too close to the front edge of the body. As a result the lenses can be easily scratched .Canon designers put no thought into this.If Canon increased the throat dept on front lens, they would have assured adequate scratch protection for the lens.Canon designers put no thought into thisLastly the protective lens caps are worthless.Canon designers put no thought into this either.Why do Canon design people, develop a first class pair of binoculars with world class optics , and then do a cheap crap design to the finished product . Beats me!!"
3,Missing Common Sense Parts,"These are nice optics! So, Canon, why not include dust lens covers?! Come on!Buyers: plan on purchasing pairs of screw on UV filters to protect the coated optices and lens caps!"
2,Overrated,"The reviews must have been written by Cannon representatives. The stabilizer works on land. However, do not buy these if you expect to use them on a boat, that is not in dock, and expect significant stabilization."
5,Cocktail Demons,Very cool. Plan to use this for my Halloween party. But you can really use this anytime for some fun.
2,Detestable Deception,"Once again, while searching for some clue to what a book on Amazon is about, I've found that the volume in question is in fact a book that was previously published under a new title, a fact nowhere acknowledged by Amazon or by the publisher. This time I stumbled on the evidence by checking the ""Look Inside"" feature, which displayed the earlier edition and title. Repackaging books in this way is surely an attempt to delude readers into making an unnecessary purchase. Customers should be wary, and publishers should be ashamed."
5,A Ringer of a Campion Romp!,"This book is one of the most madcap and dangerous Campion adventures. In it Campion and three of his friends as well as the irrerepressible Lugg are on the hunt for treasure in a tiny village called Pontisbright. They are all thrown in with a perfectly delightful local family (descendents of the manor people in this tiny village). Campion, his companions and the local family all band together to solve an ancient treasure hunt complete with riddles and lots of red herrings. Our intrepid hero, Campion actually meets a young girl who is his match in every way, and you can bet she has his measure from the get-go. This is a wonderfully written story, that has lots of surprises mixed in with madness, nastiness and murder. Read it and have a ball."
4,What a suprise!,"As a love child of the '60's, this book really brought it ALL home: the morality, the politics, the education, the sex--or lack thereof. Waves of nostalgia literally flooded my very being. Anyone still alive from this Camelot will yearn for even more. I anxiously await the sequel."
2,"Potential, but it's pretty poor","The story here might be a good one, but the mundane writing, the dead sentences and the overall lifeless prose make it hard to enjoy. I actually only finished half of it. I heard the author at a reading, liked the cover and thought I'd give it a shot. Is this a real publisher? Or is this a vanity press? I hope it's the latter because, frankly, this book is slow."
1,Doesn't Work Beware,My daughter opened hers on Christmas and was excited pluged it in and it didn't work However my friends did on my TV. I e-mailed Amazon.com about it and they sent another one got it today plugged it in and it didn't work either. Very disappointed!!
4,Thoroughly Researched. Excellent information.,"Ken Luboff has done a 1st class job in laying out the realities of moving to Mexico. He is without bias, is realistic and clearly thoroughly understands Mexico and her people. Anyone contemplating moving to Mexico, or just trying it out, should read this book. It is expansive, sensible as well as fun. My advice is: don't go to Mexico without this book in your suitcase. From Mexico's tulmultuos history to dealing with the locals, shopping, health and eating out, Luboff has covered it all. I recommend this book even for people going to Mexico for a vacation. For those moving there, or thinking about it, this book is a must. A book that is invaluable in any reference list, and a book that is a great deal of fun to read."
2,VERY DISAPOINTED,"Like most books on retiring in Mexico this book really is no different. I faxed over 30 listings included in his book and all weren't delivered as the fax numbers were wrong. I wanted info on Spanish speaking school, where they were, how to contact them, and the costs. Non of this information was available. They talked about inexpensive rentals but no info on who to contact. The title sounds great...but really gives little help to one who plans on retiring in Mexico. Very disapointed."
4,"Informative, albeit basic",This is a one day read that will be most appreciated by folks who are completely new to the concept of living in Mexico.
2,"Songs too loud, no AC power",The volume resets to 5 everytime you turn it off/on. And the songs (which my toddler loves to do) are WAY too loud at 5. And the songs are much louder than the keyboard notes. This DOES NOT come with an AC adapter (wall plug) (huh?). You must use batteries or get the not included AC adapter.Sound itself is fine for a kids keyboard.
2,"decent sound, but I returned it anyway","This little system has plenty going for it: unusual design, small size, and overall good sound quality for the price. The big disappointment was the noise generated by the movement of the disc player--in many cases, the whirring noises were louder than the music I wanted to listen to. Unless you plan on cranking the volume consistently, or all your music has a loud enough bass note to overpower the constant ""whrrr"" sound, you'll probably be happier with a less funky design that offers a little more insulation. A couple of additional notes--the pictures shown of the stereo have brightly colored circles on each of the three discs. These are cardboard shipping materials that pop out. Also, each disc area has a big red light under it, and a round green light in the middle. Kind of cool, but brighter than you might expect."
4,Reassuring look at a Witch life beyond the circle.,"This is a charming, refreshing book that isn't a 'how to'-it's more of a 'how I do it.' As a previous review states, this is a book for someone who is already walking their Path, and wants to know what life as a pagan or Wiccan is like outside the circle. I recommend both of Janet Thompson's books (Of Witches is her other title) to anyone seeking to bring the Goddess and God into his or her daily life. Read, and be reassured that you can do it, too."
1,Do Not Pay Extra For A Sony,"I paid extra to buy a Sony with the expectation that it would be a more reliable product and with the further expectation that if I were to have problem with the monitor that Sony would stand behind its product. Unfortunately that has not proven to be the case. The monitor began to develop problems three weeks after the warranty had expired and Sony's response was essentially ""tough luck""."
1,Little Style - Little Security,The leather side pouch for the T-Mobile Sidekick/Danger Hiptop looks much better in the photo than it does in actuality. The accent color (light brown) is harsh against the black surface. It is extremely obvious at a distance. The large magnet button-clasp's gawdiness only adds to the fashion nightmare. The belt clip forces the case far from the hip at an awkward angle.The magnet clasp is reluctant to stay shut and frequently comes open unaided. This is a major flaw in terms of securing your device.The case is an extremely tight fit for the Sidekick and it is very difficult to get the unit in and out. I'm told that the leather will 'give' over time; but I didn't keep mine long enough to find out.I returned mine after two days of ownership. I actually prefer the case that came with the Sidekick over this one.
2,Looks cool but didn't work well for me,"I bought this case and returned it about half and hour after I bought it. It looks neat however the biggest problem with it is that the belt clip only accomodates thin width belts. I have a medium width belt and the clip wouldnt even fit over it.While I had no problems with the magnetic closure mechanism, I found the case a bit too tight fitting. Maybe this is something that would get better with time as the leather stretches with wear, but I couldn't help but think that it was so tight on my Color Sidekick that it might damage the screen or wear off the paint prematurely had I continued using this case.I have gone with the cheaper Neoprene case and like that one much better. I am also keeping my eye out for the new leather Covertec case (which looks very nice but is not yet released)."
4,"Belce G. - Miller Place, Ny","My book called, You Don't Know Me written by: David Klass is an outstanding book. It's a fiction book and the main character is about a teenage boy, named John. He goes to middle school and he deals with problems. He lives in his house with his mother and his mother's boyfriend. He doesn't talk to anyone. He chooses to talk in his mind all the time than rather tell people whats going on in his life. John is abused by his mother's boyfriend. His mother of course doesn't have a clue about it. No one does. His music teacher gets suspicious that something's going on that he won't tell him. It seems like he's not too happy. His mother's boyfriend always blames him for everything and even abuses John's dog.I recommend this book to anyone. I loved this book. I enjoyed it very much. It was very unique style and the style makes John seem like a likable, smart guy. One thing that I didn't like was that the book got boring at times."
5,A great book,"I liked this humorous book, and even laughed out loud.ITs a cleverly written yet hard to follow book, about a teenage boy trying to make it through his homelife and school.I strongly recommend this book because it was funny and sometimes you could relate to how he was feeling."
4,Exciting,"This book was an exciting story. It is about a young boy whom's father ran off when he was younger. His mother however, is dating and shacking up with another man who abuses John. John hates him but knows that his mother likes him. It is an all around good book. Reccommended for teens at least 12 yrs. old."
4,A Spiraling Mind,"This book was good but it would have been great if the plot would have been set-up in the beginning. John is a 14 year old student, who lives a horrible life. He is beaten by his moms boyfriend and doesn't live a very glamorous school life. He despises everyone around him except for Gloria a beautiful girl in his math class. He seems like the kind of kid who has anger written all over him at all times. He continually rises his spirit with a fake tribe that performs miraculous deeds. Over all this book was pretty good. It starts off a little slow though."
3,What do I know?,"This was simply an okay read. It had nothing too outstanding, nothing great. I suppose it simply lacked depth. The story really didn't seem convining at all and kept repeating itself too much. That's really about it..."
2,We get it already!,"I was so disappointed in You Don't Know Me. I think the basic story was good, but the author's technique of describing action over the course of several pages and then telling you none of it actually happened grew extremely tedious. Once or twice within the novel would be fine, but it was used over and over. Also, after the twentieth time I read about ""the man who isn't my father"" and the ""house that isn't a house"" with the ""room that isn't a room"" I wanted to throw the book at the wall and shout, ""We get it already!"" I was forced to skip through paragraphs and I hate to do that. I think the author was capable of letting us get inside the main character's head without repeatedly resorting to tedious gimmicks. I would not recommend this particular novel written by Mr. Klass."
5,Excellent read!,"OK, I know like half the reviews here start with ""I couldn't put it down,"" but I really couldn't put this one down! It has so many high highs and low lows that you have to keep turning the pages to see what happens to your main character and narrator, 14 year old John. Tons of things happen to him within the span of only a few weeks. The only drawback is that sometimes Klass seems to be trying too hard to be funny and some of the descriptive passages can drag a bit, but don't let that stop you! Five big stars for this one."
3,Too bad these things really happen,"Compared to all the other reviewers I must be the oddball. I had high hopes for this book, but just had trouble getting into it. I did feel for John with his life and remember those odd times of being a teenager (although I have great parents). I was terribly shy and had one friend; it was easy to relate to some things. However, as I said I just found the book on the boring side for me. This doesn't mean it's a bad book; it's just my kind of book.Read it and decide for yourself."
5,You Don't Know Me,"""You Don't Know Me,"" by David Klass is very abstract and unique. Klass' style of writing creates an unusual tale of a fourteen-year-old boy who ""creates alternative realities in his mind while trying to deal with his mother's abusive boyfriend, his crush on a beautiful, but shallow classmate, and other problems at school."" Klass takes the reader on a roller coaster of seemingly useless information, brought together by the storyline, to lead the reader on a crooked path to the end."
4,"A Class Review of ""You Don't Know Me""","You Don't Know Me by David Klass was a great book. It is a great story narrated by a boy to his mother. It shows all of his problems ranging from a love that is lost to the physical abuse of his mother's alcoholic boyfriend.This book is a bit hard to follow at first, but once you get into the real thick of it, this book will really get into your soul. Klass puts you right in the classroom with John. He paints a picture so vivid that you feel the pain and happiness as John battles the problems of adolescence.This book is a definite must read for young adults who feel alone with their problems. You may think I've given away too much of this story, but I promise you, if you read this book you'll find a new surprise and new change of emotion with each turn of the page. I couldn't put it down and doubt you'll be able to either. But hey, don't take my word for it, just read it!"
5,"Loved this, must read!","This book was amazing and heart jerking. I read it a while ago and still think about it. A must read for all. If you like this book you will also enjoy ""Send"" by Patty Blount."
2,You Don't Knoww Me,"the book ""You Don't Know Me"" is about a teenage boy named John. he lives with his mother and his mother's boyfriend. John doesn't really talk much instead he talkes in his mind instead of tellig people what is happening in his life. The main part of the story is that his mom's boyfriend abuses him and his mother doesn't know about it. No one knows that John gets abused by his mother's boyfriend and when he trys to tell someone they never believe him. john's music teacher notices that he is always sad at school so he starts to pay close attention on what is happening with him. This is a very good book I liked it allot."
3,Little hard to remove,"Product seems to perform well, but little hard to polish off if you apply too big an area. I like the Liquid Spray Liquid better. Easy on and easy off."
2,Simoniz Liquid Diamonds,Found this product hard to wipe off. Smeared car finish and required a lot of effort and still did not not come off entirely. Not recommended for exterior vinyl trim - ran off on to car finish and smeared further. Would not buy again.
5,"Hands down, best garbage bag","Naturally, ""best garbage bag"" is a title that is completely debatable. Because a 45 gallon garbage bag may be the best for contractors and this bag worthless for them. But if you are looking for a 13 gallon kitchen-type garbage bag, this one seems to fit my garbage can bill to a T. The drawstring is flexible and holds the bag right in place. It also is sturdy when tying the bag off to dispose of the kitchenly mess. The bag itself is also very sturdy. I buy these in bulk in case Hefty ever decides to discontinue the model."
2,Annoying,"That ""gripper"" feature basically just means the bags will be hard to fit onto your garbage can. The bags seem to tear pretty easily, too."
5,Lives of Peter and Paul.,An excellent video in the series by Rick Steves. This really puts you in the mood to read more of the books from the Bible. Should make an excellent video to show to Sunday School classes who are studying Acts and the letters of Paul.
3,60+ minutes...good selections,"I bought this first and foremost to have a good version of Vivaldi's Guitar Concerto in D...there is an ""ultimate"" version of Vivaldi's Guitar Concerto in D-Largo out there somewhere...this is not it, but it's good nonetheless. If you are looking for a good classical guitar CD, this fits the bill."
3,Right...,"... for a long time I have loved guitars, everything about them made swell up inside like a kid blowing out his brithday candles. However, I never really given thought about guitars being classical. When ever I heard the word ""Classical"" I thought of pianos and violins. Boy, was I wrong, the guitars in this are absoulutely phenomenal, they make me very relaxed and in harmony with the strings and the music. And, this CD is not bad at all. And for a great price, I mean REALLY great price you can get this CD."
1,disappointing,"[Amazon.com]'S TITLE FOR THIS ALBUM IS INACCURATE-this is not a cafe del mar album. there is no mention of ""cafe del mar"" anywhere on the sleeve- even in the fine print.and it certainly doesn't sound like pretty and enlightening ibiza music. just a lot of amateur drum machines and mixing- with cheesy repetitive riffs that go nowhere. i honestly tried to like this album (since i spent good money on it), but couldn't.save your money and buy a real cafe del mar album (mixed by padilla or bruno) instead.my .02"
3,back to my youth,IT IS AMAZING THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER ALL THESE SONGS EVEN AS YOU HAVE NOT HEARD THEM OVER MORE THEN 30 YEARS. WHEN I WAS 17 (NOW 48!)I LISTENED OFTEN TO THIS RECORD AND I LOST IT. At amazon.com i have found my youthmemory. Thank you
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...,"What a disappointment. I appreciate Shane's attention to vocals, but he could have made a truly singular CD w/his signature guitar sound & style. Instead, he played it safe by strumming his acoustic just like a thousand singer/songwriters before him. And for someone w/supposedly rockabilly roots, he sure forgot the ""rocka"" part. This could have been called ""A Cure for the Sleep-Deprived"". The only song that approaches what I expected is ""Voodoo in the House"" & even there he lets the trumpet drown him out. And, personally, I don't need to hear any 1920s-style songs like the next-to last cut. ""When I'm 64"" was fine. Now let's move on. I thought I was in for a letdown when I saw Jay Bellerose was the drummer. Sorry, Paula & Shane, but I could play drums as well as him & I don't play anything. Maybe it will grow on me, but I expected the original ideas & sounds I love from Lone Justice & Merchants & I just don't hear 'em."
4,"Don't expect much, but sit back and enjoy","this is an 80's schlocky Italian horror film. Short on logic, long on gore and atmosphere. This is not a deep movie, just weird and gory, and fun to watchThe female lead Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni, is really an American actress, not Italian!Reccommended for fans of Dario Argento style films who like odd, non-logical gory horror"
3,More Love Than War,"This is certainly a well-made film, with excellent acting and very realistic looking sets. But if you want a vivid account of the true horrors of trench warfare in the Ypres Salient, this movie may not be for you. It's actually more of a love story than war story - good for attracting a more female audience perhaps, but a bit ""lite"" on history."
4,Thought Provoking WWI Drama,Ignore low star ratings. Put together well with sufficient realism. I viewed it on cable and now ordering a copy for myself.
3,only the facts have been changed.....,"Bearing in mind it is has been made for entertainment, not historical fact, it was a realistic interpretation of the horrors of trench warfare, and in particular Passchendaele. The New Zealand and Australians (ANZACS) took the brunt of the offensive, with the Canadians only coming in after the lessons of the first few days had been learnt. The DVD gives the impression that it was all down to the Canadians, when fact they were given three stages and several weeks to achieve what the ANZACS were asked to do in one offensive over a few days. However a good story line."
3,"Too much Canadian homefront, not enough battlefront","The title is misleading in that I was hoping for a film about Passchendaele, the battle the Canadians fought so gallantly in. What I got was a good beginning and ending and a lot of a Hallmark card in the middle. If they wanted to show homefront, then do it in flashbacks or a montage."
2,Not enough on the war,"I was disappointed this was a important battle of the first world war, there was to much of the smulch for me more should have been made about the battle. Because it was a big part of history, to much time is wasted on parts of the movie that are not important."
1,WWII History Teacher,Absolutely a failure B level movie that is an complete embarrassment to the Canadian contribution to the war. Do not waste your time.
1,stopped watching because of swearing,"I stopped watching this movie because of the swearing , the use of the lord's name in vain ... I heard the use of the lord's name in vain about 5 times and turned it off , shut it down ....very , very disappointing . there is no need for this kind of ""entertainment""...the movie would be fine without swearing ... no need at all ! ....sadly in our society there are many like thisExodus 20:7 reads:Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain....... King James version of the bible"
4,Surprising,"This movie was really a surprise for me. This movies was very well done, much more so than I was expecting. The story was predictable but entertaining none the less. While there are some very good war scenes this isn't so much a war movie as it is a dramatic romance. Some of the scenes do a very good job of depicting what I would imagine a WWI western front battlefield to have been like. More so than many other films. Overall, a good movie...a war movies, not really...predictable, yes, but worth watching at least once."
4,Horrifically good.,"The contrast between the beautiful natural landscapes of Canada and the man made mud/swamp trench system of world war one France and Belgium are clearly shown in this film. The fighting , the hand to hand combat and cratered landscape are brilliantly filmed.There is a love story in this film that sets it apart from a lot of films on this subject. But it is definitely in the same league as Paths to Glory and All Quiet on the Western Front, showing the horror and futility of the trenches in WW1"
5,Loved this book!,I bought this book last year as a gift for my mother and couldn't resist reading it before I wrapped it. I was charmed by it and had to buy a new copy for her so I could keep and share one of my own. I'm looking forward to the sequel about Mrs. Santa Claus!!!
1,Very poorly written,"I was excited by the topic and even expected it to be fictitious in parts and the way it is presented was kind of cute, but it soon devolved into saccharine. Overly sweet without any substance or satisfaction. The guy just cannot write. I expect the reason it got popular at all is because it is about Santa. The historical figure stuff is just dumb. And really the wife named Layla thing just bothered me. The pictures throughout are a bit creepy.Was hoping for something a bit more magical instead of it just telling me things happened ""because they are magic"". Please show, don't tell.It is one thing to be original with a topic that has been done to death, it's another thing to veer so far into lala land we have to ask ""Now what is this book about?"" Not even a child would like this."
2,Maybe too much truth.,"I found the book strange in that seemed to want to dispel many legends, such as many of the miracles accounted to Saint Nicholas, King Author, and Attila the Hun, and even Santa Claus. At the same time it wants to add other hits of magic and fantasy.This St. Nicholas travels the world giving gifts to children and during his journey encounters several historical and fictional characters that become his helpers. His ""magic"" is time slows when he travels and those who join his team gain immortality. There are no elves in this version, and Santa adopts most of his ""trademark"" characteristics, (sleigh, reindeer, living at the North Pole) after they have already been written about (normally making Santa quite mad since they were not true at the time).But the thing that bothered me the most was that some of the writer's political views made there way into the story. It just didn't seem right.I found a better book to be ""Flight of the Reindeer"" by Robert Sullivan."
2,Too smart for its own good.,"Reading this book, I could not help but see it more as a vessel for the author to show off his extensive historical and Christian knowledge than a tale about Saint Nick. There were far too many unnecessary details that drew attention away from the story.Something else that constantly pulled me out were the questions posed by Santa to the reader, it was as if the author wanted me to stop thinking about the story and instead realize how improbable it was that it was actually by Santa. I think with the direct questions, ""That last chapter was rather sad, wasn't it?"", he was attempting to remember a quainter time...it does not work for him.If you want an innovative and beautiful Christmas read, try The Legend of Holly Claus by Brittney Ryan"
2,Show how commercialism married Christianity and Superstition,"Guinn's book, read properly, demonstrates historical attempts to pervert the reality of Christianity by tainting the Nativity of our Lord with legends, myths, magic, and commercialism. It proves that the invention of the Christmas season has become a secular and demoniac victory."
2,The Autobiography of Santa Claus,The seller was quick and fulfilled their side of the transaction.I'd bought this for my 10 yr old niece who still wants to believe in Santa Clauseven though her classmates are calling her a baby and telling herthe other side of the story. I'd read a review by a mom who's 8 yr old was in a similar dilemma.She said it was the perfect book for her daughter and they both loved it.But my niece was very upset by the book andstopped reading it. So buyer be careful. If you are giving it to achild be sure they are ready to read it.
2,The Autobiography of Santa Claus,"Some reviewers stated they were reading this to their children, my daughter would have fallen asleep. It was not an enjoyable read."
5,This is the BEST gift from Santa yet!,"While Christmas shopping a few years ago, I happened across this book at a local shopping mall and Christmas has not been the same since! This book is historically accurate, which adds to its believability. Santa explains his life and how many of the legends that surround him are made possible.Santa is careful to consistantly tie the holiday back to it's true meaning--to celebrate Jesus' birth.It's a wonderful combination of magic and logic to make Christmas as wonderous for adults as it is for children!An subtle touch that was given to the book is that it's 24 chapters, which lends to starting the reading on December 1 and leading through to Christmas Eve, just in time to go to bed and dream of Santa's visit."
3,Not sure what to think,"I started out loving this book. The opening line ""you're right to believe in me"", I thought was a fabulous way to begin. But most of the middle was just a long history lesson. It seemed like the author was trying to do his own personal commentary on the history of the world & war by pretending it was Santa's point of view. I found some of the famous people who became permenant Santa helpers hard to swallow; particularly Attila the Hun. What?! And when he got to Santa's commentary on how we shouldn't have fought the American Revolution I almost stopped reading the book. The ending was pretty good & had some magic, as did the beginning. So I'm torn. Overall I'm not sure it was worth the time to read it."
5,Perfect Christmas Gift,I bought this book for my 20 year old niece who loves to read. I chose it so she can keep believing! Perfect for someone to add to their book collection.The Autobiography of Santa Claus
3,The Autobiography of Santa Claus,"This was a good book , although a little hokie at times. I told a bunch of friends with elem age children and they read it at night during the holidays to their kids with much enjoyment. For me, it was entertaining and somewhat magical. A good read."
3,Autobiography of Santa Claus,"This was a strange book. The actual history lesson was ok, but mixed with the way that Santa got his helpers and who they actually are is a bit strange."
5,Heartwarming and wonderful,"Many children lose that christmas spirit by not believing in Santa Claus. This is because the crazy stories about him are so far-fetched and unbelievable. This book shows that he is real, and renews your faith in the fact that one man with a dream can do so much good. It effectively blends christian beliefs (Nicholas was, after all, a priest) with secular traditions and shows you the history of the season. And... the details of the story are real and factual enough to renew anyone's faith in Santa Claus."
3,It was a pleasant read,"I've read this book once when I was little, as a friend had given it to me. I loved it. It remained in my mind for the past few years as I've had a craving to read it again, but couldn't since I didn't own the book.So, finally, after a lot of research, I found the book again and purchased it, and just like back then, I loved it.It's a different, fantastic version of Santa Claus that has roots within history and ties it closely with magic, and it's a very good, well thought tale that will make you fall in love with it as a whole, especially with all the Famous People joining in the Giving-presents crew.A book for children and for those adults who don't mind to return to childhood for a short while..."
5,GREAT audio for adults and children over 6,"This was the best use of 9 hours we've spent in a long time...I'll preface with the fact my daughter, 10 years old, has dyslexia. I wasn't sure if this would bore her, but it held us BOTH spellbound. Each time we got in the car, we couldn't wait to put it on. It's structured that you can do 1 chapter each night, Dec 1-24, but we couldn't wait. It wrapped in history, folklore and the explanations for everything about Santa was enough to make me believe again! I think we bought at least another year of believing for our daughter with this set!"
5,Tom T,"Bought this for me wife, although this ""Scent"" has been around a long time..It is wonderful..She get numerous comments about it, and people say they never heard of it...As long as we continue to find it on Amazon...I will continue to buy it for her, it REALLY DOES SMELL THAT GOOD.."
4,Handy Guide To Have Around The House !,"This 70 page book is useful for everyone, not just women !! It covers virtually every major household appliance and offers quick and easy ways to handle your appliance problems by yourself, before you have to call the repairman. Actually, some of the appliance problems are quite easy to correct, as she points out. A little knowledge can be helpful. You don't have to be an an ""expert."" Worthwhile to have on hand."
3,"Useful info, but pretty thin","It's always good to get the ""real story"" from somebody who's been in the trenches for a long time. But I thought that for the price, it was on the light side."
5,The title says it all,"There is no magic in Leah Nielsen's book; there are no cheap allusions or tricks in this book. It's good writing, plain and simple. No matter what your tastes are, No Magic has more than enough variety to satisfy you. The allusions to Norse mythology are fresh, and the last poem, ""How To Go About Leaving,"" is a wonderful end to a great book. If you want to read smart poetry, buy this book. Buy this book now."
3,Unfortunately Not What I Expected,"When using this product, I chose to use each battery for its own controller, so that me and my brother could share the cost. The batteries, when used in conjunction with the nunchuk, have a slim battery life of just over 2 hours average. The color of the batteries does not match the plastic of the controllers, and the stickers on the batteries leave a terrible residue.The plus side? If you intend to use the two batteries together, one at a time while the other charges, then this should be fine, as each battery will last longer than the time taken to charge the other battery. Design is nice, snaps well into wiimote, although quite tight for constant removal and reinsertion. Cheaper than batteries regardless for the lightweight gamers like me, who hate having the batteries die when they only play an hour or two a day, at most."
2,not that good,"This product does not work that well, charge last maybe an hour. Regular batteries the way to go."
1,Don't buy this charging station - dangerous,"I wish I could give this 0 stars...it is dangerous.I purchased this charger and it has been in use since Christmas day. Last night, my daughter was trying to put a battery pack into a Wiimote and the battery pack got extremely hot in a few seconds and burned a blister on her finger.I thought she just had the battery in wrong so I foolishly went ahead and inserted it into the Wiimote. It went in ok and all seemed well. I put the Wiimote in the doc and left it until today. The battery pack malfunctioned and melted in the Wiimote destroying both the battery pack and the Wiimote.I'm working with Beach Audio to see what they will do to help. If they don't replace my Wiimote, I'll go to Amazon and Intec next."
1,not worth the money.,This product is not worth the money. It only charges when the Wii is powered on.
4,Great with a small drawback!,"Love the product, it will save us a ton of $$$ in batteries, but I wish it were possible to leave the colored ""skins"" on the wii remots and still use this charger. We have one remote for each child (with their corresponding color) and it would have been nice to continue to be able to use them. But that's a small thing. I LOVE how much we will save it not having to buy new batteries all the time!"
4,Brazilian big band?,"Brazilian movie actress and TV personality Hebe Camargo came in at the tail end of the pre-bossa nova pop era, and a couple of things set this collection apart from the others in this serie. One is the sound quality - the work on here dates from 1952-67, and in general has bright, clean punchy production. Then there's the material, which more overtly tilts towards North American sensibilities, in particular towards big band and straight pop vocals -- for example, the first disc starts off with a brassy, swinging cover of Bob Merill's ""Mambo Italiano"", and other latin dance tracks pepper the set list. She also dips into rock-tinged girl-group-ish trills, yet with a reserved classiness typical of ""grown up"" pop vocals of the era. Nice voice, too -- clear, confident and full of good humor. Worth checking out!"
2,Ungenerous,"Vanguard Visionaries is an extraordinarily disappointing series. The label has an excellent roster. If they wanted to publicise their archives, they could have been a great deal more generous at this price - or else offered it for $6 or so. It's also disappointing that Vanguard is ignoring some of the wonderful stuff in iys archives and focusing instead on meaningless releases of this variety - the ""greatest hits"" by the same artists, on the same label, are a much better deal."
3,Civil War and Reconstruction in Alabama,"Learned a lot about the conditions in the state after the Civil War, which were quite awful. But I was looking for regionally specific examples rather than the state as a whole."
1,Master of the Obvious,"I expected something more than a review of search criteria that should be well known to anyone who has been through the job search process. This is especially true with the executive search process. I found no revelations here. In fact, I thought that the book was written on a much lower level than those to whom it was written to help. Unless you have never been involved in the executive search process, don't bother reading this book."
4,"Obvious stuff, but not everyone gets it right","I am an Executive Search Consultant, a Headhunter, and I found this book to be a simple and useful checklist, especially for more senior hires. It is so easy to forget that the competition out there really is very high for jobs, and the more senior you are, the more you have to make sure your career management strategy is a very deliberatly executed and well thought out one. No one has time to read verbose books, so this one is light, and easy to remember and to refer to later.I admit that it covers the basics, but if you get those right, then you have a strong foundation on which to build. The book is a good start."
1,poorly produced compilation CD,"If you are looking for Mozart's Bassoon Concerto, don't buy this recording. (1) It is only the third movement, not all three movements. (2) It is listed and advertised as the ""First Movement: Allegro."" (3) It's not all of the third movement - the entire third solo episode is cut. (4) The soloist, George Zukerman can be heard playing ALL of the concerto elsewhere."
2,The cure for Insomnia,"I had to read this book for school, and that is the only thing that kept me motivated to read it! It is informative, but extremely boring! I have read many text books and this is hands down the worst second only to Family Theories: An Introduction also by White. This man knows his stuff, but he can not write. The book outlines family theories in a way that makes a visit to the dentist look fun. He covers the subject he set out to do that is the only reason I gave him two stars. If you are a professor considering this book please reconsider, if you have any compassion for your students, however, if you are basically EVIL and want to make student suffer this is the book for you!"
2,"blah, predictable story, lackluster cast","I am a sucker for a good romantic comedy and thought I'd enjoy this. What I realized is that it has to have something pleasant to focus on, since the scripts are all predictable. I've sat through many with Meg Ryan because she is adorable. Mary Stuart Masterson is not, even though she shuffles, flatfooted in baggy pants the way that Ryan does. With Ryan the shtick is very cute because she is basically charming and beautiful...even if it does seem like it was stolen from Diane Keaton.The most interesting thing about Mary Stuart Masterson is her name. Perhaps she's a fine actress and does well in more serious roles. But in this,a love story, she fails. Christian Slater is better but even his down-and-out personal seems awfully fake.I watched it for about 40 minutes and turned it off."
4,Romance is alive!,This movie let's you know that true romance never dies. To never give up on yourself!
1,Please don't believe the hype; total waste of time and insult to intelligence,"Although I, like another reviewer here mentions, rely heavily on Amazon reviewers to guide me in my decision-making over mainly which movies to watch, reviews like the majority of ones presented here make me very skeptical about how much I should continue doing so. Actually, I've started selecting the lowest ratings to look at first because I'm finding in many cases those are actually more in harmony with my thoughts after seeing a movie. And this is definitely one of those cases. The Amazon review as well as the far too few negative reviews presented here reflect totally my feelings about this movie, so I will not add more except to direct you to those."
4,Good romantic film,"I actually liked this romantic, sappy tale. You have to be in the right mood to enjoy this though. Christian Slater is endearing as Lewis. A great love story."
2,This movie is not wretch proof,"Gag, gag, barf, barf--this movie will make you wretch. First things first, this guy is a stalker. It would have made a great premise for a horror movie--like Bed of Bloody Roses. You know the guy sees the girl through her window and keeps sending her roses and roses and roses, then starts killing off people around her one by one. Anyone in their right mind knows that a guy that met you in this way would not be normal and you wouldn't be all thrilled to meet him. My advice, if you need to throw up something that possibly made you sick, rent this movie and watch it. It shouldn't take long. You may wonder, why did I give it 2 stars. Well, it inspired that other great movie about Bed of Bloody Roses and I couldn't have thought of this without it."
5,My Favorite Movie!,"This is by far my favorite movie. I read the other reviews about the plots and the characters, and I just don't think it's that important. It is an intriguing romance that will make you catch your breath. A quote from one of my friends ""Oh I wish that would happen to me!"" Leaves you hanging at the end, but still a wonderful movie."
5,WOW-Sends The Word of Romance!,Wish it could be a true story book romance with what happen after the ending. Christian Slater is one that makes you believe....Great performance!
3,Interesting movie,This movie was ok. The acting was good. Although it was short(at least for me). I also thought that the passion level in the love plot was a bit low. It does make it a bit more realistic but at the same time I thought that it could've used a little more passion. Christian Slater was good.(I liked when he explained about his wife.) Mary Stuart Masterson was good as well.
4,Too much kissing,"This movie is not bad as far as romantic movies go. Both main actors do a pretty good and convincing job, and there seems to be a decent amount of chemistry between them. There are a couple of disturbing things about the movie. The first is the fact that Slater's character is bascially introduced as a clingy, stalker-like person who Masterson's character goes out with after only a minimum of concern. The other thing is that she kisses him early and often which seems a little out of place. Other than these two little issues, this is about what you expect out of a romantic movie. It has the the initial infatuation, the eventual fight/breakup and the happy ending."
1,Too bland for me,"One of the people on Amazon who gives this film 5 stars does admit that it has ""a trite script"" and is ""a feel-goodromance,"" and that's why I finally started to skim through it, while watching it. Christian Slater ""is almost terminallynice,"" as the ""Time Out"" film guide says. He's a good actor, but the character he plays is too nice and bland to bebelieved. Because of the script, the characters, and the directing, it all adds up to a weak, tiresome film. I'm glad I saw it on TV, so that I could then erase it. I'd suggest renting it first before you buy it. The reviews on the ""Rotten Tomatoes"" website are also interesting to read about this film."
5,"A top quality, little known romantic movie","This movie is what I would call a ""Sleeper"". It is very good, and truely romantic. This is a good movie for a date or romantic evening."
5,terriffic movie,i loved the movie and i have watched it over and over christian is terriffic as lewis and marry masterson is great as lisa they work well together i would recommend this movie to anyone who loves romantic movies
3,Vast in scope; minute in detail,"Vast in scope; minute in detailI read this bio immediately after reading Michael Schumacher's bio of Phil Ochs. The Phil Ochs biowas lean and mean and riveting. Michael Schumacher took another route with this book, and madeit long and detailed. It's often boring, but you really get immersed in the subject. Allen Ginsberg wasa role model for me as a gay man, and as a person who has been fearlessly open about who he is. Iadmire him more after reading this book. An abridgement might be desirable for the general reader.There are just too many exerpts from journals. The author cuts out after 1980. I would go back to1970 as the cutoff date. The early years, the ones that made Ginsberg famous, are the fascinatingones. The years after Chicago demonstration seem repetitious."
5,Ingersoll Rand Impact Socket Set,"This socket set is well made and, it comes with a nice molded case at a great price!All of the sockets are laser etched (easy read), which made changing out my struts a cake walk.For the quality, quantity and price, this impact set can't be beat! Snap-On, Matco, Craftsman & Mac we're all priced way higher!"
5,Art of Ancient Iran,"I am a collector of ancient Persian Art and i found the book of The Mahboubian Family Collection an excellent reference book to help me with my collection, and i would like to congradulate Houshang on his vast collection. I strongly reccommend this book to any scholar and collector. I am extremly fascinated by the exact dating and reference to the location of the pieces, which was very helpful to update my knowledge on the Ancient Neareastern Art."
3,My Baby Done Left Me....,"Having recently bought the ""Cowboy In Sweden"" album and thoroughly enjoyed it, I had high hopes for this CD, unfortunately I found it slightly disappointing. As noted elsewhere, the album is very sparsely arranged - dare I say, too sparsely? Good though they are, I wonder how much better songs such as ""If Its Monday Morning"" and ""I'll Live Yesterdays"" would have sounded with Hazlewood's customary inventive arrangements. The more uptempo songs in particular don't work - the song that seems best suited to this spartan approach is the spooky ballad ""Come On Home to Me"". Nonetheless, it is still Lee and he's on good form vocally and lyrically (even if the spoken intros are a bit corny). One more thing, the whole album lasts just over 25 minutes, which once you remove the intros means about 20 minutes of music!"
2,Lame,"One of the two pieces broke the first time I tried using it. The other works ok, but its so cheaply made, I doubt it will last long."
3,Fluid Mechanics Textbook for class,The book came as described but the edition was not the one for the class I'm taking. The class requires the newer edition. Thanks though
2,Fluid Mechanics for Chemical Engineers,This is a simple basic book about fluidics. Not complex equations.Not a heavy mathematics. Contain useful information about technology process with fluids - bubbles and two phase flow.Published in 1998 has relatively old information about everything.Positive side - has a small chapter (20 pages) aboutMatLab PDE Toolbox for solving fluid mechanics problems.No connections with COMSOL at all or any kind of simulation.
3,"Decent book, but needs a solution manual.","Using this book for my second year university Fluid Mechanics course. The book content is fairly clear, however the problems are very challenging, and there doesn't seem to be a solution manual."
2,Delivery of the book took 26 days,it took 26 days to delivered this book ... common other vendors sent books within 5 days. So your vendor must did something wrong on this shipmnent here.
3,"Nice product, challenging to assemble","I am happy with the end product, but found it unusually difficult to assemble. The holes are not as precisely drilled as they should be and the parts can be quite challenging to line-up and fit together. I had to do quite a bit of (what felt like) forcing and banging pieces into place, and I am very familiar and comfortable with self-assembly furniture."
5,Love it!,I have been looking for a while for a piece that would match my dining room furniture. This bar is perfect. Color is darker than what shows in the picture (more like a dark espresso) which works for me. It was actually easy to put together and it came very nicely packaged.
4,Nice piece,"Really enjoy this piece, it's well made for the most part. It did take a little effort to get it put together, I did have to get my husband to help. It's not a high end piece, but definitely worth it's @$200 price."
3,"Almost perfect, but not quite.","I was surprised how quickly I received the item after I was told it would take 20-25 days for shipping. It arrived 5 days later. The assembly of the cabinet is pretty straightforward but just looking at the pictures, but not all the parts fit exactly as planned, and is quite frustrating. My major issue was that the drawer that folds down doesn't work as well as I wished. The holes designed to hold the shelf in place were not drilled to the correct size and thus the shelf slips of the stopping point and acts more like a swinging door. All in all I think I paid for what I got and it makes a nice wine butler. As a side note the finish (at least on the top) seems to absorb/released moisture as I had a magazine sitting on the top of it and it left the outlay of the magazine on the top and looked like the finish had aged quite quickly."
2,Cracks and discolorations,The product looks fine overall but came with some discolorations throughout as well as a cracked front door and a back panel that wouldn't fit during assembly. I'm trying to work with Amazon in order to replace the damaged pieces but it's not ready to display the way it is now.
5,Great and fan! I wish to live in stone age!,"Dear Author, I'm sorry to know it too late neverthless it was published in 1994. I'm a resque survyer in Japan, and a fan of stone tools. I'm interested in so-call ""sprinted or scaled piece"" , and the author gives me a very significant insightes. Thank you and good lack to your study! I would like to introduce your study to scholars in Japan. Sincerely yours, Jun-ichiro Matsuda"
4,great text.,this book is full of great information. It goes into detail and covers all aspects giving much insight to the world of flinknapping.
4,40000 years learning to chip rocks,Men have learned to make tools by lost techniques from study and tips by a few native Americans who kept the skills alive.This books discusses both the history of stone tools and techniques that you can learn to make your own arrow heads.Flint and Obsidian are the two most used types of rock.You can hurt yourself doing this:I read a novel about the new Stoneage and the occupation of making points was one that led to scarred hands.I enjoyed the book.
1,Written or borrowed??,"I have been knapping for a while and thought this book looked interesting but was sorry I bought it. Mr. Whittaker must feel the need to reference every single work by previous authors on the subject instead of creating his own insights into flint knapping. I was hoping to get his perspective on different aspects of stone tool use and making but instead found page after page of regurgitation from the work of others.The catch line, ""Making and Understanding Stone Tools"" was a real stretch. Don't waste you hard earned money, but some flint instead. The one reference he made from an elderly gentleman who was generous enough to share years of information went mostly unmentioned."
5,Solid purchase,"This is a pretty solid purchase, It covers more then just ""how to"" knap. The chapters that focus strictly on knapping are pretty in depth as well. If you decide to purchase this book, I would suggest not skipping through any of the chapters. You will miss valuable information.SOLID PURCHASE"
5,PHENOMENAL!!!!,This novel had me mezmerized! I couldn't put it down until I had finished the entire book. The author had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see who the murderer in Megan Montgomery's nightmares would turn out to be. The steamy romance between Megan and David will bring me back to D.L. Edwards again and again. A must read novel!
4,sturdy but odd fill point for rear bag,"The fill point for the rear has mesh in the fill hole which makes it harder to fill. Not sure if your supposed to remove it or not, but it made it rough not having a place to insert some sort of funnel. Also didnt like the velcro closure on the rear bag, feel like it might want to open on its own. But only time will tell.Otherwise its made of nice sturdy material and has worked well so far."
3,Caldwell DeadShot Boxed Front and Rear Bag Combo-Unfilled,"The size of the bags were not listed in the sales ads and I found them quite small for some of my large rifles. I filled them with""RICE"" an found them to work well on some of my smalled weapons."
1,please do not buy,Very poor productMy son was using it with a .243 rifle and the bag tore to pieces after < 10 rounds!I threw it in the garbage can at the range.
1,How can you go wrong with Mozart?...Buy this and find out.,"I was extraordinarely ignorant when I purchased this recording. I thought,""WOW!! Look at all the music you get in this CD set. The price cannot be beat!"" When I received the CD, I discovered that you don't really get any music at all. This is a great sample CD, and should be bought by a person brand new to classical music. However, if you have any experience with classical music, you will want to pass on this CD.Each of the pieces are hacked apart to the point of it being comical. It's interesting to listen to the greatest music in the world, only to have the development cut. All of a sudden I was thrust into a new key, I thought my ears were going crazy. Perhaps an effort by a decent high school orchestra, but this music is not up to snuff with any other recording.Do yourself a favor and go out and purchase real recordings of Mozart, and not watered down stereotypes."
4,Mozart Listener,This is a good CD if you like Mozart's music. It is not the best CD I ever purchased. It is nice to listen to it in the morning before I go to work. And I sometimes listen to it in the evening before I go to bed. It is relaxing and soothing. I am not a music major or therapist. This is the best review I can write. Mary Agnes Cross
3,Abbreviated!,"The music is of course beautiful but these (all the series) are NOT complete works! So they are good for listening to in the car or home. They are a great introduction to the classics, though."
4,perfct for my Boston,I bought this for my Boston Terrier who loves to burrow underneath covers. This bed has a nice full fill and a half moon plastic rod that holds up the entrance. No problems getting in. My only complaint is the rod kept slipping out of the fabric cover so I cut the rod shorter and stitched it to hold it in place. with all these type beds the cover also goes back so every so often I pull it back up. Very cozy for a chilly house.
