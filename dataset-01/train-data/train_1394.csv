3,Not very deep,Didn't expect bowls to be so shallow. Wanted to use for microwave primarily and because not so deep can't really use them for that purpose. OK otherwise.
5,Very Nice Product,"These Micowave bowl are pretty good, I use them for work,I like the vented bowls, they seem to keep the meat moist & keep the micowave clean. I order these because of the price they are ALOT cheaper priced than Tupperware. Clean up good & the lids stay on while in transet.They were alittle smaller than I would like, but still do the job VERY well!! I'm going to buy another set, I'm hoping they will come out with alittle bigger ones soon."
4,Great fun,A great insight into the life of a young teen in rural PA. Lots of humor as this young man reflects on the his journey one summer. Especially enjoyable regarding the county fair.
4,Deep Movie,"More of Audrey Tautou, however you won't see her much in this weird film. However this film's look at the theory of chaos is done in such a simple, beautiful way that it's amazing."
4,Charming,"Lovely, deft movie about the small acts of many unconnected people effecting others' lives. Very nicely drawn characters."
4,"A brain-filler, but a glorious movie nonetheless...","I got this movie ready to compare it to Amelie starring the same actress, Audrey Tautou. I loved the concept of the movie, how every simple gesture contributes the the working order of the world and the stance in which things happen (hence the title, Happenstance). The way things happened and when I thought about it made me grin, but I must admit that the characters, even the main character, weren't very likable at all. However, this might hint the concept of karma, or perhaps sybolizing the utter imperfection of the world.In conclusion, I really loved this movie simply because it just clicked together so perfectly and that it makes you think. People who don't like to think, don't buy this movie, but for those who like to look at things a little closer, yes, do buy this movie. My only complaint: it's hard to keep track of what happens because of all the zooming around between so many long storylines."
3,Happenstance,"Good, nice, okay - an enjoyable albeit rather mediocre film. Playing on the idea of ""six degrees of separation"" a sales clerk and a barrista fall in love."
2,"Wonderfull premise, but lacking execution","The idea of seemingly trivial actions being important is cute and a playfull idea, but not if the end result is boring. Other than some sharp dialogue the story is simply a ""Rube Goldberg"" vehicle to facilitate the preordained, and rather off putting, ending. Loose ends are left as such and the viewer is left wondering why any of the characters were introduced in the first place. If they didn't deserve to have their trials and tribulations resolved...then why were they there?!? Could have been, should have been, wasn't. Too bad."
3,Not as great as I had hoped.,"I loved Audrey Tautou in Amelie and like many people, had pretty high expectations for this movie. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. While Tautou was great, the movie was slow and I was bored. The story just wasn't as riveting or enjoyable as I had hoped. My friend's DVD player was on the fritz and we had problems watching the movie, so we ended up skipping ahead to the last chapter to see what the outcome was. After all the slowness, the end was predictable."
2,Weird Movie!,I usualy like french movie but this one doesn't make sence. It got to many little stories that doesn't really had an end to it. The only good thing in this movie is the french atmostphere but beside that it's not a interesting movie.
5,Excellent Detailed Book!,I read and used this book extensively in the late 1980's for my work and studies. I lost it years ago and have missed it many times since then. I am purchasing again now as I find I cannot be without it for references. A+++
4,Celestis,"Paul Park definatly made an impression on me about the way our country and our life form lives our lives. We all depend on wanting to be something we are not. Here we've got Simon and Katherine,a human working for the diplomats on Celestis and the other an alien that takes drugs and has surgery so she can be more human physically and mentally. Park definately shows detail in how Katherine develops sexual tendancy, almost too much detail. When these two are kidnapped all her forms of drugs are no longer available and that is where the book becomes very exciting."
1,Dull and monotonous,"I was not impressed. The plot was virtually non-existant and could have been told in much less space. The dream sequences from Katharine for the most appeared to be irrelevant or, at best, unclear as to how they fit in with the story. The relationship between the humans, aboriginals, and demons was difficult to follow. And the overt sexual content was a bit much."
1,Avoid this one like the plague!,"This is the worst compilation of film clips (all silent, by the way) that I have ever seen. The over-dubbed music score is execrable. The producers of this one should be prosecuted for pollution!"
2,not worth the price,"From 1997, this is yet another middle of the road release from the once mighty UK vocal trio the Blackstones, who I like a lot.The performances on this lp are quite uninspired, in my view, and therefore do not warrant much of a review, and certainly do not warrant a recommendation for the price you would have to pay to get it. They did much better, so save your money, try to find their ""Insight"" lp for a great look at them, or just buy another lp all together."
1,Not accurate,"I bought one from a local grocery store. One of its claims is that it can be recalibrated -- true enough, but you can only calibrate it at one temperature. If you calibrate the temperature in ice water (32 deg. F), it's about 20 degrees off in boiling water (212 deg. F). You can't calibrate so that it will read accurately over the entire range that the unit claims to be able to measure, which means it's fairly useless."
1,Broken by steam!,"This type of thermometer is not as durable as it should be. I used it to measure a custard sauce that I was cooking over a double boiler. The slight amount of steam that it received, during the tiny amount of time that the tip of the thermometer was immersed in the custard, destroyed the thermometer. It filled with water and ""died"".This is unacceptable, the thermometer should be well able to handle this type of usage."
1,Didn't do much and I think it killed my koi,"I did a lot of research on looking for ways to control the algae in my koi pond. I live in CA. I came across Ecofix. Some reviews on other sites, a minimal number, claimed it killed their koi. I figured due to small number, shouldn't be a problem. I can't prove it killed my koi, but soon after using nearly the whole bottle in the duration and dosage outlined on the directions, my koi began to die. I would come outside and they were floating. Big koi and smaller koi. I also noticed while cleaning my filter, that there were small things moving around.In four years I've had the pond, nothing like this has ever happened before. Never had koi just die and never had anything like I saw in my filter until after I used a bottle of Ecofix.I can't prove it was Ecofix, but I don't believe in coincidences.Oh by the way, it did nothing in terms of reducing algae."
4,introspection and perspective,"through pictures and sparse words this book gets to the heart of what much of the turmoil that people go through in their life. It make me smile, chuckle, frown and think. It stayed with me for a long time after reading it, rattling around in my head. That's the mark of a good book for me."
4,Hauntingly beautiful,"But not for everyone. When I was watching this film, I found it dragged a little in parts, but afterwards, I found myself haunted by some of the imagery and the tragic story. It really brought home the human cost of the Chinese Cultural Revolution -- not because of beatings and violence and denounciations, etc., but through the sheer waste of humanity and emotional suffering. Yes, this film is depressing - but beautiful."
5,Intense,Reminded me of Zheng Yi Mou's To Live. Show's the corruption and abuse of some Communist party members during the Cultural Revolution through the exploitation of a naive girl.Highly recommend it.
2,"Good, not great","This movie has some elements of an excellent movie -- the scenery and acting are fantastic -- but the good qualities are ultimately overwhelmed by melodrama. Particularly the last hour is a transparent set-up culminating in a manipulative ending. It is a shame really that this movie went the path of melodrama, because an honest portayal of sent-down youth would be extremely interesting. There is no doubt of the insanity of the Cultural Revolution, but the reality was far more complicated than Joan Chen wants to portray here. Ironically, she seems in the end to be making a anti-PRC film as propaganda driven as anything originating from the Cultural Revolution. Those interested in a film dealing with events from this time period would be better served by watching Zhang Yimou's To Live, which is a FAR superior movie."
3,Sex: The Annabel Chong Story - REVISITED.,"This reminded me of the movie noted above and this moved too slowly for my liking. ""Raise the Red Lantern"" is the best Chinese movie I've ever seen. If you're looking for an entertaining Oriental film - see that, not this."
2,Colleges for B students?,"I actually think this book should be called A College Guide For ""C"" Students. For the most part the schools were not put forward in a way that made them look at all appealing. Not nearly as helpful or hopeful as Loren Pope's book, ""Colleges That Change Lives"""
2,This Book Gets a C minus,Very limited comments and list of schools. Did they have to pay to get into this? You mean the rest of the schools are either bad or only accept A students? Come on - I want my money back.
1,very disappointing - don't buy!,"I thought this book was awful. It seemed to be written using a formula, and the author just cut and pasted the facts in for each school. There isn't a great deal of information here, and much of what is here is not reliable. I found lots of typos and mistakes. It was poorly researched and poorly written. Get yourself a copy of Loren Pope's wonderful book ""Colleges That Change Lives"" instead! There are lots of great options for B students in Mr. Pope's book, and much more useful information."
2,I was not impressed,"I am a college counselor, and I was quick to purchase this book, for I anticipated that it would be helpful in helping my 12th graders looking for non traditional approaches to some over looked colleges. It is far from that. When one looks at some locally placed colleges in Illinois, the book refers to DePaul, Loyola Chicago, and Bradley. While there are students with B's on their transcripts attending these schools, these students also scored within a high 20 to mid 20 on their tests, and I am certain that they have 3.o plus gpas.I guess my major difficulty with the book is that is doesn't deliver what the title promises. It promises information regarding school for ""B"" students. I don't think it did that well at all.As far as the information provided, it is accurate, correct and quite comprehensively delivered."
1,where is my book??,I havent received the book yet. I did send an email of inquiry and have not received a response yet.
4,Wicked nice yo-yo!,I am a big yo-yoer and this definantly meets my yo standards! Yomega is the best yo-yo manufacturer around and they really make top quality toys. This yo-yo is great for beginners and beginners only. Its automatic cluch system make the yo-yo return automatiacally. It is a great thing for beginner yo-yoers. The downside is you cant do extreme tricks with it beacuse of the clutch. It doesnt enable a long enough spin for tricks like barrel rolls and brain twister. But it is really terrific with the rocket and U.F.O. I definantly recommend this brilliant yo-yo!
2,Not worth the money,"If you really know and like Arkansas this will be very disappointing. Arkansas is a beautiful state but you wouldn't know it from seeing this video. They avoid most of the areas of natural beauty and when they do venture slightly into those areas, we notice they filmed this in late winter or early spring when trees are just starting to leaf out, arguably the least attractive time of year in Arkansas.A few of the topics they cover are interesting but most are just stereotypical small town/hillbilly type stuff that could have been shot in rural Kentucky or Tennesee. If you don't know anything about Arkansas before you watch this, you still won't know anything after you see it.Production values are amateurish but would have been OK if they had let the state's natural beauty and friendly people speak for themseves.And it is way overpriced."
3,great stuff...but no freebies,"I've used these products before, and they are great for working out and recovery when doing resistance training...what i didn't like is being sold on the deal with the 'free samples' and NOT getting them even after i e-mailed them to see if it was coming later or perhaps they may have forgotten.... no reply at all. will go elsewhere for same money."
2,Doesn't ship the right items,"I ordered a n.o. xplode, nitrix, and cell mass, but this guy sent me two n.o. xplodes and a nitrix. Very frustrating, I got about a third of my money back and a free n.o. xplode so that was good, but I had to go out and buy an expensive cell mass."
1,Shipping is LATE!!!,Bad service!I paid extra for shipping and it never came on time!Did not answer emails either.Frustrating!Will not order from them again.
5,Huskies,My sister likes purple and dogs. So what better here in Washington State than a Huskies throw for her when she is watching tv.
1,disappointed,"I purchased this product, and 6 kits by the same maker for a school enrichment project. What a waste of money! the mortar never solidified and therefore the monuments could not be built. The bricks just slid around and collasped."
4,Performance Friction Carbon Metallic,"I have no regrets about buying this product. I have been doing my own brakes since the 70s. Most of the time I used semi metallic Wagners. In recent years I have used ceramic pads. After getting in an accident the year before last I have had serious questions about ceramic pads. Ceramic pads are noisey and create alot of dust. Ceramic does not have the stopping power of semi metallic. The carbon metallic brakes are comparable to semi metallic. Carbon metallic may be better although Performance Friction has not provided any statistics prooving they are better. I have not seen any dust in the past three weeks. These pads are perfectly quiet, no noise, and they have good stopping power,(much better than ceramic.)The only reason I am giving them a four star rating is because Performance Friction could do a better job of marketing their product. Aside from this it is likely I will buy this product again."
1,Beware: Defective Optical Block,"I purchased this tv in November 2005 and became aware of the known issue of the optical block failing after my purchase was completed. I crossed my fingers and waited for the green blob to show up but instead I was one of the lucky ones with black backgrounds showing up as dark blue. Now I'm afraid if I have them install an optical block (the warranty was extended due to a class action lawsuit) I'll just have the same problem a year or two from now. This was a very bad $4,200 investment and I would encourage everyone to do a search for SXRD and Optical Block on the internet to see what I mean. Sony discontinued manufacture of these tvs in 2007."
1,PLEASE DO NOT BUY,"WE BOUGHT THIS VERY EXPENSIVE T.V AUG OF 2006,ALL MOST TO THE WEEK I TURNED THE T.V ON AND THE COLOR WAS VERY BAD.THEN AFTER TWO WEEKS TO GET REPAIR OUT ONLY TO FIND THAT IT WAS THE OPTICAL BLOCK,(MAIN GUTS OF THE T.V)AFTER SIX MORE WEEKS THEY CAME OUT AND PUT IN A SECOND GENERATIONBLOCK THAT WOULD HAVE COST 2500 EXCEPT IT WAS COVERED DUE TO MY 500.00REPAIR WARANTY WE PURCHASED.AFTER THE WORK WAS DONE IT WAS THE BEST EVERSEEN ONCE AGAIN.NOW AGAIN TODAY MY OVER 5000.00 T.V. WILL NOT WORK !SONY COULD CARE LESS,THEY KNEW THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS SET AND PUSHED IT OUT ANYWAY. I AM NOT RICH AND I HATE SONY FOR THIS.I HATE THEM.TOM S"
1,Rich B.,After 2 year the light engine goes and Sony will not do anything for it.Sony settled a class action lawsuit with reguards to theese t.v.'sand anyone that has problems now are on there own.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SONY TV MODEL !!!,"Sony TV model KDF60XBR950 has an inbred defective ""optical block or engine"" which will manifestitself after about 3-4 years of use. A bright neon-like blue line will appear at the bottom of the screen and will gradually get wider & invade the whole screen image.After multiple tries Sony ""Customer Relations"" (that's a joke)refuses to admit that there is anything wrong with this model even though there is plenty of evidence to the contrary.They refuse to extend warranty on this $550.00 part + labor even though they were aware of a problem because they did extend a warranty for a short period in June 2008.Please be aware of this defective Sony product and probably others and make special note of their total lack of concern when you contact their so-called ""Customer Relations"" Dept. Its true name ought to be ""We couldn't care less"" Dept."
5,Too expensive,"Great LCD 60 Proj TVJust purcahsed it from Sams, which was $1500 less.Why is it so high here."
2,Beware ...,"The Memorex DVD+R 16x that I received were Taiwanese made CMC MAG M01. They are not the highest quality by any measure. On NERO quality scan, you get between a score of 40-75 (okay, upper 70s). I bought some ProDisc that scored in the 65-90 (and the 65 was only 1 disk, most in the upper 70 to 80). The Taiyo Yuden 8x was getting me 85-95 range. Too bad that Amazon does not carry (to my knowledge) the better ProDisc or Taiyo Yuden."
5,Great For Making Copies,I bought these because I have a Sony Handycam and whenever I make the mini DVD's I can make copies to share with my family. They work great!
2,Umm...,"Burned several discs and applied full-surface labels. Didn't work in any of 3 players. Have burned a bunch since then w/out labels, and they seem to be OK. But if they're anything like the CDRs from Memorex, the without-label surfaces will chip away within a year and render the DVDs useless.Anyway, when we buy a spindle of any blank media, we shouldn't have to wonder if the first 5 or 10 are going to be trial runs. I guess I have bought this brand so many times because of the price/quantity relationship at local stores. I'm ready to switch to something more reliable."
1,Broke after 2 uses,"This umbrella is really neat, but ours broke after only 2 uses. I would suggest trying a higher quality umbrella."
4,fairy earirngs,I like these fairy earrings because they are a bigger size than most. I dont like small earrings. However for $50 I thought they were overpriced cause they are lightweight material and kind of cheap looking. I would have liked something heavier and the crystal pieces more substantial. These were more a $25 earring but the customer service was great and I kept them anyway because I love fairies! Kandy W.
2,Uneven and uninspired,"Ah, Calabria. Is there a more appealing locale on the face of this earth? The author clearly recognizes the unique charm of this region. He just can't seem to convey it very well to his readers. The vignettes are interesting but he just can't sustain your interest long enough to care."
1,Clumsy effort,"I made the mistake of judging the book by its cover (and title). The premise sounded great but the author just couldn't pull it off. Poorly written and even more badly structured, he never seems to decide whether his book is a travelogue or a search for roots. Don't waste your money."
5,One amazing album by vomitory,I realy love vomitory...Been following their career and they yet haven't let me down! True brutal blastbeats and a mean sound vocalist which makes this an work of art--i recommend it.
1,Worst ever,I couldn't believe how small these things were. Smaller than a dime about 1/2 thick. I expanded one... as a trial. It fell apart into about 1 tablespoon of soil! Wooo-hooo. What am I going to do with that? DO NOT BUY! I want my money back!!!!
2,much smaller than expected,These things DO work. They were just much smaller than I expected. (about the size of a quarter). I was going to use them to create a giveaway for a trade show so the visual was important. I'll use them for something else though.
2,These scissors don't cut it!,"Although relatively inexpensive, these scissors do not cut very well. There are ""dead-spots"" along the cutting surface, which is frustrating for the detail work we do. We would gladly pay twice as much for a similar scissor as long as the entire blade edge cut true on each tool. These scissors might be okay for a paper hobby-ist who would occasionally use them, but not for professionals who need good cutting tools everyday of the week."
4,Good - but supplement.,"This book is the best resource I've found for passing both the Proficient and the Expert exams. I passed both on the 1st try, however, I also encountered a few questions that were not covered in the book. Just make certain you have an above average user's knowledge before you try to take the exams. Otherwise, you may find this book cannot teach you all that you need to pass the exams."
2,The True Story????,"We are very disappointed in this book. If you are wanting to still lie to your children about who Santa Claus is but merge that with some truth about Jesus Christ - then this is the book for you. But, if you are like us and want to educate your children on the historical Santa Claus and avoid the ""fairytale"" Santa Claus that comes down your chimney - then you do not want this book.The author should learn the definition of true...."
1,Not waterproof - lasted 2 months,"As mentioned by others. It got wet in the sink and the screen fogged from the inside. Then the glued on silver label started to peel off. Then, after about 2 months it just stopped working. Waste of money."
2,"Nice at first, failed quickly","I know a lot of people say this is waterproof, but mine did not survive long. Within 2 months it died, it would not read accurately and would not stay on. Battery was still in 80% charge. Normally I love this brand but this one let me down."
5,Just what I was looking for.,"I had one thermometer like this at work, and I liked it because I could hang it around my neck and not lose it. I searched and found what I was looking for, and ordered several. Thank you."
5,taylor digital thermometer,"very accurate, easy to read and use. lanyard is extremely helpful esp. after lossing every other thermometer i've had. solid secure 'snap' top closure. recommend!"
2,Not very waterproof,"I know this is supposed to be a waterproof thermometer, but my wife ran it under the faucet to clean it and the screen fogged up inside. I took out the battery and found water in the compartment.I give it as many as two stars because until the water got in, it did work as advertised. And seeing that other people have had no problem with the waterproofing, I'm wondering if I just had a bad o-ring.Now, I'm off to find a better thermometer."
4,great little thermometer,"This product has so many great features. After reading reviews on other thermometers, I realized that it needed to be waterproof, and this on is. I have used it on roasts cooked in the oven, and it works quickly (although not instantly) and accurately. I'm looking forward to using it on the grill too. Because the cover can be attached to extend the length, I hope it will work well for that also. If so, I will rerate it with 5 stars."
1,Questionable quality,The first one I got was DOA from the box and was replaced. The replacement lasted just 3 months. Not going to waste any more money on this brand.
3,One Little Drawback,"Actually, this thermometer is a gem. It does everything it says it will do. It's best to have it off when you insert it into the meat though....and then turn it on for your read. Oh, the little drawback? Leave the battery out of the thermometer or else it will drain. This is an inconvenience but...it's that or dead batteries. Other than that it's a great item!"
3,Not especially fast reading,"I bought this because it is supposed to be a fast read thermometer... It does take a temp, eventually... but is not what I would call fast."
3,Choose another thermometer,"I used Taylor thermometers in my professional career for decades but this one is cheap and not durable. After about a year of home use, the plastic has broken and I'm in the market for a replacement. I hand washed it so it was never abused in any way. It's just a crummy product."
5,An excellent small gift!,I purchased this item as a small gift for my daughter-in-law who thoroughly enjoys it and uses it very frequently.
3,Practical Inexpensive and Useful,"I was looking for simplicity and this was it cheap price, easy handling, no complications. I was cooking for fifty this summer, working on a bunch of Beef Wellingtons. The meat had to be cooked exactly, no guesswork. It did the job!"
1,It did not work.,It did not work. I need to send it back. Very disappointing. I previously bought a different model made by the same manufacturer and it works great.
2,Broke pretty quickly,"Started glitching up after about 10 uses. It works sometimes, but sometimes randomly turns off or randomly resets the temperature readout. I've been careful not to submerse it in water, so not sure what happened.Also, as others said, it is pretty slow to stabilize at a temperature reading - takes 20 to 30 seconds before it stabilizes at a readout within +/- 1 degree F of the actual temperature."
5,Great Thermometer,"This is the 3rd instant read thermometer we've tried. It's the only one that's lasted more than a couple of uses. I didn't submerge them, just rinsing was enough to destroy them. This one registers the temperature quickly and the hold button is really handy so it doesn't need to take the temperature up from ambient for a 2nd check of meat temperature on the grill. I can wash it [it can get wet without dying]."
1,Not for professional use,"Morale of the story: you can't get it wet, don't ever drop it and it's not gonna work in three months anyways. I bought one of these for my restaurant and after getting it wet, it stopped working. So I got another one and was more careful, this one had a lengthy run of three months(it looked a mess by the end, those button covers wear off in two weeks) before it crapped out. I've been on our third one now for two weeks, last night in the middle of service it got dropped from 3ft up and stopped working."
4,Taylor meat thermometer,Great thermometer. Have used for each meal since purchasing. Also like the waterproof feature. Would purchase another one if needed.
2,Accurate but not waterproof,I used this 3 times to check the water temperature at Walden pond and the third time it failed. It was obvious that water had gotten into the casing and caused the failure.
2,taylor thermometer,i am very sad to say that i was un happy i use a thermometer every day to to help me do my job you would think you order some thing new it's going to work not in this case i am working in IRAQ not like i can take it back to the store i would have to lose more money send it back to you i am A chef a lot of my staff want we to order them one after i show them mine in i add it dont work i would not have them to pay all that money for noting i order a lot from AMAZON i will re think that THE order be fore that i order CD and got what you wanted me to have NOT WHAT I ORDER i will now keep give you money in not get what i want BUT YOU GET MY MONEY AND THAN GIVE ME A HARD TIMETHANK YOU
1,JUNK!,Bought one and I used it twice in one week. The third time I went to use it it wouldn't turn on. I returned it and was given a replacement that worked for about 2 months ( less than a dozen times ) before it broke again. Complete piece of JUNK! Save your money and look elsewhere.
5,One of the best,"Quite possibly the finest axis figure produced by 20th century toys or Gi Joe. The outfit, gear, and overall assembled appearence are spectacular. The scoped FG 42 is also a very nice touch. One of the best features is the educational value. The inside box cover tells a brief synapsis of the Gran Sasso rescue, a well-executed operation. This figure is a must have for collectors or anyone who just likes a cool action figure."
5,AWSOME,"THIS DVD IS AWSOME. IT SHOWED WHAT A YOUNG ADULT CHOIR SHOULD SOUND LIKE. THEY WENT TO CHURCH. OF COURSE GOD DOES IT AGAIN THROUGH DIETRICK AND DIMETA. LIFT UP YOUR HEADS ALL YEE GATES WILL HAVE YOU SHOUTING FROM THE ROOFTOPS. BY IT, AND LET EVERY ONE YOU KNOW WATCH AND LISTEN. GOD BLESS DETRIOT, MICH. D.J.T-LUV"
3,NU Hymnz Review,"I thought it was a great album and dvd. I would recommend it to any one, that's into praise and worship.."
1,It amazes me that this guy got published.,"I just can't stand James Kochulka. I thought it pertinent to post here since the people who bought the book are obviously already fans. I live in Burlington, where his ""American Elf"" comic strip takes up half of a page in Seven Days newspaper. I never get the jokes, and I think that it is very badly drawn. Lately, I have begun to cover his column with the B section of the news paper. That way I can read the other comics without his ""art"" in my periphery."
1,Disgusting Author!,"No! No! No! Do not buy this book - If you want to support a sick, sick author - Go ahead.Strait from the author himself:Bath wrote, ""I'm glad there are molesters out there"" because they supplied images of children being sexually violated by adults.In an online chat with another accused child porn collector, Bath wrote, ""I wish a 9 yr old was doing that to me,"" Sussman told the courtroom. ""This,"" he added, ""from a man who's writing books for 9-year-olds.""Bath fell under suspicion of federal agents in recent years when two agencies -- the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE -- began independent investigations of the author's alleged trading of child pornography.Sussman told the courtroom Monday that when ICE agents searched Bath's home last June, seizing a Compaq Presario computer, portable memory devices and DVDs, they found movie clips of children -- some of them bound -- crying as they were sexually abused."
1,Author child pornographer,"Author convicted in federal court as a child pornographer. Burn the book if you have it, and take it off Amazon!"
1,AUTHOR CONVICTED OF CHILD PORN!!!!!!,K.P. Bath Sentenced to Six Years in Prison for Child Porn. Do NOT give this guy more money!
5,raw unadulterated souldrippin crazy goodness,"this is a lot of music for the ching. damn, this stuff is raw and tastey. this is not like his overproduced, smoothed out later releases. i gots lots of dub, and rock steady, this one is unclassifiable...or is it... (see title of review)."
1,The most horrible movie of all time,"This movie is so bad that it does not deserve my time to even get into details but if some of you get a kick out of reading reviews of awful movies, you can enjoy some of the reviews by other unfortunate people who have seen this movie for one reason or another. All I can say is that the actors are a complete joke, the budget of the movie is not more than $1,000 and whoever directed this movie made a desperate attempt at creating a ""plot"" which after seeing 5 minutes of would make any decent director collapse from laughter. Bottom line is, unless you are on the verge of suicide and have nothing else better to do, avoid this movie at all costs."
1,Worst movie ever,"This movie is a joke. Writing is horrible, directing is horrible, acting is the pits. Any questions?"
1,What a waste of cash,"He claims to reveal the SECRETS of serak. Then, he shows us techniques that are literal intepretations of the forms. No pressure point stuff. No physics. No jing. Nothing. That's like saying the secret color of the sky is blue. Sure didn't seem very secretive to me.Furthermore, despite Joey's claim of breaking from tradition (isn't that the new popular battle-cry?), he never studied the art. At least when Bruce Lee did it, he studied Wing Chun for a number of years BEFORE going formless.I'd highly recommend you buy the silat tape from Steven Plinck or Steve Gartin instead. At least that has some material on there that's worth the money."
1,Simonet is a liar,"Joseph Simonet claims to be an expert in the Indonesian martial art of Serak Penjak Silat enough that he can release an instructional video tape containing advanced concepts. In fact Mr. Simonet knows almost nothing about Silat in general and Serak specifically. He sudied briefly with Victor and Willem DeTouars, who themselves despite their reputations studied very little Silat. Victor studied Serak from his older brother for one year, and then proceeded to make up the rest of his art. Simonet follows in his footsteps as far as Serak goes. Mr. Simonet may be an experienced martial artist in Chinese Kenpo, which is essentially what this tape contains. I think this video is insulting to the oldest DeTouars brother and to the DeVries family, as well as to the memory of their teachers John and Ernest DeVries as well as the teachers that came before them."
1,"Poor quality, slow, and inaccurate","I got this thermometer to use at culinary school. First of all, it is slow. I need temperature readings in seconds, not minutes, and I would expect better from a digital thermometer. Second of all, I got this thermometer because it is advertised to read up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and I need a thermometer that can also do candy work. I could not get it to read above 220 and the plastic melted when it got that hot. Don't waste your money."
3,It's ok,Its ok for the price but takes a long time and is not super accurate. If you want something a little better tyr a thermapen. I probably would just go for the thermapen myself.
3,Good but not heat resistant,"I've used this for several cooking functions. However, one day I noticed that it had moister underneath the screen. I never immersed it water but rather wiped it clean with a dish towel. I'm not sure how / where the moister came from. The display started to blink and it has never been reliable since. I still have it, but I don't use it anymore."
5,Performs as described,Excellent product. Works exactly as described and detailed in instructions. Readout is less than 10 seconds. Easy to clean and store. We use it @ grill site. Would recommend to anyone.
2,Takes too long to get a reading,"Just pay for a Thermapen. It will save you in the long run. This device can take up to 15 seconds to get the final reading. When grilling, it's just way too long."
4,Mine Lasted 5yrs,"The battery last long...easy to replace. After getting liquid inside, it was jumble on the LCD. I am buying another."
4,Best Instant Read Thermometer I've Used,"Very accurate, easy to calibrate, can read temp on shallow foods because sensor is in tip, but won't bend when inserting deep for a center temp, and speedy reading (6-10 sec). (Lost a star because, well hey, it can always be faster.) I still may invest in a Thermapen someday, because Alton Brown and America's Test Kitchen rave about them, but for now I'm quite happy with this little thermometer."
2,Slow and not very durable,"I used this for about 7 months as an 'instant read' thermometer for bread coming out of my brick oven as well as a milk thermometer for my morning lattes. As the temperature creeps up slowly on the milk steaming, it worked fine for that. But, when I wanted an instant read, it easily took 10 seconds or more to get an instant reading on bread that was at an internal temperature of around 190 degrees. It was frustratingly slow for this application. Same goes for oil for frying. I don't want to hold my hand over hot oil for 10+ seconds if I can avoid it. Use the old-fashioned Taylor for that, which I love. This unit broke after 7 months because the battery connection inside the unit failed. I handled it gently and it broke. I would not buy this again. Looking for a better unit."
5,Standard issue,This is your very standard issue thermometer that works great and gets the job done. I buy one about every three years due to extreme were and tear. The last one I had the LCD display went out due to extreme heat conditions.
1,Not the right thermometer for me.,"Very hard to calibrate. Need a little screw driver one for glasses, and time. Because you will need to turn and turn to get it to the correct degree (32). Would not recommend."
1,Garbage,opened and turned on to make sure it worked. It then sat on the counter for a few days until today when I needed to use it. It was then washed by hand (never submerged) and air dried while my pork cooked. A few hours later I turned it on....or tried to turn it on. Dead.
1,Remember When Chinese Junk Was a Ship?,"This is a ""Taylor"" instrument in name only. It stopped working in stages after about the third use. First, the on/off was inconsistent, sometimes you had to press hard, sometimes press-and-hold, sometimes press-wait-press-wait-press-wait. Finally it stopped working altogether and, predictably, at a critical moment. I was reluctant to purchase it at first but later decided that Taylor probably wouldn't put its name on junk. Unfortunately, this time, they did. I guess you have to spend more money than this to get a reliable digital thermometer. This one certainly isn't. Not everything made in China is trash but this one was and that's where it ended up -- in the trash."
5,Perfect meat every time,Great little thermo - I've used this for the past year and given several as gifts for the cooks in the family. It reads fast - easy to keep clean and very accurate. I know have gotten my wife to use it and now she doesn't cook chicken until it is a dry hunk anymore! yea!
4,Solid thermometer for all uses,"I received this thermometer a few weeks ago, and so far have been very happy. It is exceptionally accurate and is useful in every situation - from chocolate tempering, grilling, and even coffee brewing. Solid construction, but long-term quality can't be judged with a few weeks of use."
5,Great temperature range and easy to use,"I love this little thermometer. It reaches a reading within 10 seconds or so, and is accurate over a great temperature range. I use it for all kinds of things...checking my water to proof yeast, meat temperatures, candy, chocolate, and even to check the ambient temperature. It has a nice protective cover and is small and easy to store. I simply could not cook without this little helper beside me.UPDATE: I've had this thermometer for almost 2 years now and it is still going strong! Seems to be very durable and has great battery life."
1,"Terrible, not reliable.","Purchased this and within only one month of gentle and proper use the numbers faded out to where they finally disappeared completely. Amazon's customer service sent out a replacement and that one was dead upon arrival. Absolutely terrible quality. I would not risk buying from this brand, it is not a hardy or reliable thermometer."
2,Loved it - until it broke!,"I really liked this thermometer. It was easy to use, and a handy gadget to have around (especially when cooking meat). I hadn't used it but 10 times and it stopped working. I changed the batteries, but I never could get it to work again. It's fairly inexpensive, but I was still frustrated that it only lasted for like 6 months... Hopefully my experience was just a fluke."
2,Not Worth Your Money,"I ordered this trusting other reviews thinking I was getting a good deal for my money. However, after multiple uses, I have found its inaccuracy to be a problem. I am in the food service industry so as a chef I must make sure food is the right temp. before it is put away. With this thermometer, even though the product is cold to my hand it will begin temping at 110 degrees and the counter will continue to count up to about 150 even though it is around 60 degrees. This is a defective item, you aren't getting your money's worth and I would not recommend it."
3,Convenient,"- Convenient and easy to use.- Not waterproof as they claim it is.- Fairly Accurate. ( +/- 1.5 C )- Relatively Slow. (If you throw it in a boiling water, it takes 30-50 seconds to reach 100)"
1,Does not work!,"The first thermometer I ordered did not work when I received it, so I returned it for another. This one worked fine the first time I used it, but ever since I have to replace the battery with a new one every time to get it to work. Needless to say, that is ridiculous - so it is going in the trash - very disappointing!"
4,Tested Indoor,"This thermometer was tested along with the other one I purchased and with 4 others; 3 of which were my landlord's. The readings were in line from this thermometer. I wanted to prove that my thermometers were accurate, so I purchased this one, which was the same one my landlord was using."
5,STILL WORKS AFTER LEAVING BY STOVE,"Like an idiot, I left this thermometer right next to the stove. It was burnt pretty severely (half the screen was BLACK). I was about to throw it in the trash when I noticed the blackness starting to fade and the display coming back on. This all happened in a matter of minutes! I'm very impressed with this thermometer's durability."
1,Used twice; Quit Working; Now in Landfill,"I used this thermometer twice. It did not get submerged in water or anything else. It was turned off when not in use. I tried to use it again, and it would not work. I threw it in the trash."
2,No too happy with it,"The colors were eye catching and I never trusted the dial/analog thermometers so I wanted to try out a digital one; hoping for a more trusting temperature.It was probably accurate but it died after about a month. Granted, it wasnt too expensive but I think it shold last at least a year, to be fair to buyers."
2,Can't calibrate it,"I bought this for my husband who works in a kitchen and he absolutely loved it at first, however when the time came to calibrate it he gave up after several attempts. Given that I had bought it for his birthday, I was determined to calibrate it for him so he could use it. I sat with it, the directions and a container of ice water one night for over 2 hours to no avail. I bought this dispite the other reviews reguarding calibration and I am sorry... Money right out the window :("
2,When it works it is great but . . .,"After using it twice, it started to malfunction. The screen 0 out and a little E (for error) showed up in the corner. When it works it is great. It just is inconsistent."
1,eats batteries,"After two uses within two weeks, the battery died. I replaced the battery with a new one ($1.99), checked to see if it worked and put it away in a drawer. A week later, I tried to use it and the new battery was dead also. I had used a volt meter on the new battery before and afterwards. The new battery was which was fully charged when new was drained. The thermometer was defective and Amazon won't let me return it because it is outside of the return period. Don't get his thermometer -- it eats batteries."
2,Don't buy this thermometer,"Bought this in 2007 and its been thrown away years ago. Buy a thermoworks for about $20 fast, accurate, well made."
1,please don't waste your time & money,"I've never had a Taylor thermometer that lasted more than 2 months.Fragile construction, displays that are damaged by moisture and heat...Taylor thermometers: ""Hey if it dies quickly, they'll just buy another!"""
2,Dropped once and its finished,"I used this product occasionaly for about 1.5 years. It seemed to work ok. One day I dropped it and reading became 30C off. Tried to calibrate but the screw does not work, nothing happens. I threw it away."
3,Temp?,The battery that came with it lasted all but a couple of days. I replaced it and all seems to be working well.
3,digital thermometer,"for the money it is a ok thermometer.first to calibrate it use ice and a little bit of water to calibrate it at 32 degrees. forget boiling water unless if you know at what altitude are at.i find the bimetal more durable,slower,more reliable.also the digital ones accuracy changes with the battery voltage.i worked for a living as a air conditioning mechanic for 30 years.besides the thermometer just gives a reference point to work with as in life nothing is absolute"
2,"Works great, but eats batteries.","Works great, can be calibrated, but lacks an auto-off (or maybe it doesn't turn off for a very long time), so if you forget to turn it off a couple of times it needs a new battery. Fortunately they're easy to replace, but an amazing oversight. Will probably by something else to replace it soon."
5,Excellent Buy,Purchased two. Used to probe the temperature (375-degreesF) in a home built oven I used to temper bamboo for fly rods. They exceed my expectations and are a very good value!
2,not waterproof,"After a couple of washes I see water inside the gage indicator. I don't know much longer it will work with water inside. If it weren't for that I would of given it 4 stars, with its fast and accurate reading."
1,Would not calibrate,Disclaimer: I worked in the foodservice industry as a restaurant manager for over a decade. I know how to calibrate a thermometer.I tried 4 different times to calibrate this thermometer and it got worse and worse. I returned it.
1,Simply Does Not Work,"I received the product as described. I opened it and carefully followed the instructions to calibrate it.When I used it the first time, the temperature displayed turned out to be at least 20 degrees F higher than it should have been and the meal was undercooked.The next time I decided to borrow two working analog thermometers to compare readings. In a cup of hot tap water, the analog thermometers were very close to one another. The digital one registered 14 degrees F low, and then in a separate trial two degrees F too low.So I decided to compare them on some salmon I was cooking. The analog thermometers were consistent with each other, reading 120 degrees F. The digital one first read 92 degrees F, and then read 186 degrees F. These were all taken in the same piece of fish at the same location at the same time.The bottom line is that a thermometer needs to be accurate and consistent. This one is neither."
4,Works well,I have bought so many meat thermometers that don't work and I have finally found one that works. I like it alot.
5,Digital Thermometer,"No fancy bells and whistles, does just what I need it to do. I love the digital aspect versus the ""old school"" thermometer."
1,Junk,The primary use of thermometer is to determine temperature. This one does not do that. My first clue came when I could not calibrate it to 32 degrees. Then I checked the temp. in boiling water. It climbed to ~180 degrees and stopped going up. No wonder that turkey never seemed to get done!
3,Taylor Commercial Thermometer,I have a Taylor Commercial Thermometer that I have had about 18 months.I went to use it today only to find out it needs a new battery. Upon opening the back to get the battery number I found that I can't access the battery as it is covered and the cover over it is soldered on. So one more thing I thought would last is going to the trash.
2,Digital thermometer,Hard to read the face plate to see the temp. I actually went out and bought a differnt but simmilar digital thermometer from target that I like much better.
2,don't care for this,"I have always been told to never get a digital thermometer, but I bought this because the reviews were very good. Lesson learned ... don't buy a digital thermometer. At its best it is a little hard to read, at its worst, it is impossible to read. It also stops working when it gets hot. Also, I just flat out don't trust it.... it never gave me a temp over 140 degrees when I make chicken which I knew had to be cooked... sure enough it was, so clearly it was well over 140 degrees .... save your money and buy something else."
5,"Great product, Great Shipping",This was a gift for a friend that home brews beer. He needed a thermostat that was able to be calibrated for accuracy. Most of the ones you find in local stores do not have this feature. If they do they cost a lot more. Upon receiving this gift he opened it and calibrated it. It was only off by .1 degree F. You cannot beat the product for anywhere near this price. I recommend to anyone that need accuracy in cooking or brewing.
3,Hard to read,"The display is small and not backlit, so it is not easy to read when in use.But it doe seem accurate."
3,Slow Readout,"This is a decent thermometer, but it takes to long to give a accurate temperature readout. I use this when cooking meat on my Big Green Egg smoker and I have to leave the lid open to long to get a accurate temperature read. I do like that its waterproof as I ruined my last one by getting it wet. I think I'm going to have to upgrade to a more expensive instant read thermometer."
3,Calibration doesn't work,"I tried to calibrate this (instructions are included), but when I turned the dial, nothing happened. It's not super fast at getting to temperature, either. Overall, I'd say it's average."
4,THERMOMETER,The thermometer was delivered in a timely manner and it was received in good condition. It appears that the thermometer is reading about two degrees low. Recalibration instructions were provided with the literature.
2,Dead battery,"Item arrived promptly, but with a dead battery. After going to the drug store to get another one (grrr), the battery compartment was quite a challenge to put back together. It took my wife and I a good 10 minutes trying to jigger it back in. Granted, it works and takes the temperature, but next time I'll purchase a different brand."
5,THE thermometer to have.,"I love this thing! I've bought so many different ones, analog and digital, over the years, and I've had so many stinkers I was about to give up. This one is fast and accurate (I checked, and it can be calibrated too). It's probably the first of those that I can say of that.I will probably buy another one so I can throw my other crappy thermometers out."
3,"Fairly accurate, difficult to turn on.","The main reason I only gave this product 3 stars is because I find the little button to turn it on is not very user friendly. It seems you have to push it in just a certain way and for a certain amount of time for it to come on. When I first got this I thought it was broke because I couldn't get it to come on. Now that I'm used to it, it will come on most of the time. The temperature though does seem to be pretty accurate."
4,Somewhat pleased,"Digital face is somewhat hard to read, would have prefered a longer stem, otherwise unit works properly as described. Would recommed this product to anyone looking for something like this."
1,Disappointing.....,"I'm very disappointed in this product. It was difficult to calibrate, and not very accurate once I did get it calibrated. It lasted only a few months. My advice: spend more than ten bucks on a meat thermometer."
1,They work good for about 2 months,"I have had two of these and they do NOT last, I returned one and when I went to retun the next one the window of return just passed. I would NOT buy another one of these."
5,"Accurate, durable and fantastic customer service",My first thermometer experienced some sort of issue with the display and started showing random numbers on the screen. I contacted Taylor and they recommended sending it in for a replacement (even though I had it longer than the year warranty). Within 2 weeks after sending it in I had a new thermometer.This is perfect for measuring the ideal temperature of water for my tea and Aeropress. I have also used this to measure the temperature of the air in my apartment as well as internal temp of meats.When they say waterproof...they mean it! I accidentally dropped this into a teapot of boiling water. It stayed in there for 1 minute in 200+ degree water. After pulling it out the entire screen was black and I was sad to throw it out. The next day when I got on Amazon to re-order one I noticed their waterproof claim. I dug the thermometer out of the trash and sure enough it was working! Amazing.
1,Not Waterproof!,"I used it only three times, trying to wash it carefully afterwards, but it still ruined the display. The regular, black ""home"" version of this thermometer has lasted longer for me. Save your money and please do not buy it!"
2,Mediocre accuracy and no calibration,"Somewhat disappointed in the variability in accuracy .Within 1 degree in Ice water, but 5-6 degrees too high for boiling water. Unfortunately the calibration adjuster does nothing at all, not even a tenth of a degree difference no matter how much I turn... Only good for a rough estimate the higher the temp is."
2,Not Accurate and Potentially Dangerous,"From the start, it was apparent that the temperature displayed was 5 or 6 degrees higher than two other digital thermometers I had in the same room. So I followed the calibration instructions and was only able to get the display to read 34.1 degrees in a 32 degree solution... ok, so I can live with 2.1 degree inaccuracy. After calibrating, the room temperature was also only off by about 2 degrees. However, I decided to test it in boiling water and the display read 193 degrees (water boils at 212F). So, If you are counting on this thermometer to tell you anything important (such as if your meat is cooked suffiently or if your beer water is the right temperature for steeping), I would make sure it is accurate at the temperature of interest before using... or avoid it all together, which I wish I had done."
2,"Works fine, if you dont use it much or expect it to last","I had this model for about 6 months, used it maybe 12 times, washing after each use. Came out of the dishwasher the last time and has not worked since. In retrospect, it always took a while to give a reading. Not a good unt."
2,Taylor 9842,"Broken already. May be waterproof, but not rugged enough for outdoor use. I got what I paid for."
1,Eh...,I don't really care for this thermometer. It's hard to see the numbers on the display. This is used to make sure my son's bath water is a safe temperature. I miss my OXO thermometer and will be purchasing another OXO to replace this one. I don't recommend it.
1,Tayor Commerical Thermometer,"Purchased this thermometer to be used on the grill, I thought I was getting a great thermometer. Description said it was water proof. The first time I used it I had a grease flare up on the grill. It melted and fell apart. So much for the commerical thermometer. Do not recommend for grilling."
2,Didn't last long!,"Item was billed as waterproof, so I was not careful when around liquids. I guess I should have been as after about six months of use it quit working. Display went blank so I thought it might be battery. Took it apart & the inside was rusted out. I never left it submerged for any length of time, just tested liquids & washed it. Can't be too surprised, it is a $10 thermometer"
2,Not Waterproof,"I used this thermometer while I was making a batch of beer, and decided to soak it in my sanitizer solution while all my other equipment was being treated. When I pulled the thermometer from the warm solution I noticed that the display was completely wet. There appears to be two layers of plastic that cover the display and water was in between them. The unit still worked, however, was very difficult to read. I was able to dry it out by placing it on top of my furnace register. I will try using it again on my next batch, however, I will not completely immerse it into the water."
5,Nice upgrade,Excellent improvements over my 8 year old model. Glad I spoiled myself with this purchase. Will buy more as this is a great gift idea.
2,Currently occupying the rear of the junk drawer,"Ordered this thermometer to take advantage of more precise digital temps, but overall found that a standard old fashioned thermometer is better at this price point.There are two major cons with this unit in my opinion.1. Takes a fair amount of time to register the temperature. My understanding is you can buy more expensive digital units which register the meat temp very quickly, this is not one of those.2. Breaks or runs out of battery juice fairly quickly. This should draw little power and I would expect to last years and years on a battery. But mine died within a year.So, since this is no faster at registering temp than an old fashioned thermometer and is more likely to fail, I don't see a reason to use this over one."
2,Insufficiently durable.,"When I first got this thermometer I thought I had gotten away with something. It wasn't as fast as the Thermapen is alleged to be, but it was plenty fast, accurate and dirt cheap.Unfortunately, after a year, the little rubber stopper to the battery compartment is broken, the numbers are too faded to read from a distance and the accuracy is gone. Sigh, I guess it's time to put that expensive Thermapen on the ol' wish list.I gave it two stars instead of just one because theoretically you could buy a new one every year for 10 years and still not spend as much as on the industry's big gun. If that's how you roll, go for it."
4,"Accurate, inexpensive, and fairly fast","Accurate, inexpensive, and fairly fast--10-20 seconds. In a pot of boiling water at sea level it registered 100.4 C and 212.7 F. All that's missing is a pan-clip for candy and deep fat. Available at Walmart, as ""Sunbeam,"" for $7.97."
2,"It works, but there are some major flaws","The temperature it reads consistently lags behind the temperature of something being heated, so it can be annoying to work with. It doesn't come with a clip to hold it to the side of a pan, which has caused me many problems.I've dropped mine into hot pans multiple times, because I don't always have a hand to keep on it, and if I pull it out, the reading goes down and takes a while to come back up. Because I dropped it into something at 165 C, the covering over the display wrinkled, but it still works, and is still water proof.I recommend buying a thermometer clip to go with it, or buy something else. This doesn't seem to be a very capable product by itself."
1,Wont turn on,"Perhaps it is just the battery in the thermometer is already dead, but the thermometer will not turn on. Very unsatisfied with this as I have never had a amazon product that is faulty before."
1,Broke after 2 weeks,Got this thermometer right before Christmas. I used it 3 or 4 times and now the screen is completely unreadable and filled with condensation...pretty odd for a waterproof thermometer.
1,Didn't work for me,The temperature readings never seemed accurate. It gave out on me after only using it a few times. Had higher expectations for a Taylor product.
2,Stopped working,I e only been able to use it once and now it won't work I've even tried changing the battery but it didn't help
3,Taylor 9842 Thermometer,"Good enough for the price. It can not be put in the oven, or in the freezer. I find the latter a strong fault. I bought it in part because it was rated for -40 degrees F. But the directions say its circuitry can't function in that cold an environment; a paradox. So, I can not check the temperature in my freezer (something I wanted to moniter). It is easy enough to read though, and seems accurate. I like that it has an OFF switch, and that if I forget to shut it off, it does so anyway. Its reaction time is as advertised."
3,Great....but,"This thermometer is so convenient to use except for one big annoyance. I am a professional cook and we often carry our thermometers on our uniform using the clip. This holder is not secure, every time I bend over, the thermometer falls out of its yellow holder. I have tried tape and even rubberbands (which do work somewhat). Otherwise, the price is right, the temperatures seem to be very accurate and I do still use it a lot."
2,"Don't Believe It - It is Not ""Waterproof""!","When I first received this thermometer it seemed to be fast and accurate. It was correctly calibrated when received and seemed to hold true.Now 1 month later. The thermometer got wet and now it does not work. The digital screen is completely dead. The return policy states that I will only receive a partial refund and I will have to pay the return postage.It is advertised as a ""Waterproof Digital Thermometer"", which it is definitely not. If you purchase this thermometer, you will have to treat it with extreme care. If it gets wet - it won't work!"
2,Not suitable for grilling,"I bought this because of its advertised tolerance of temperature range. And that seems fine and tolerant of my high grilling temperatures. However, it is really, really slow, sometimes taking 10 seconds to stabilize on a temperature. It also requires you do insert an inch into whatever you're cooking. I don't grill things that thick on the grill all that often. This was mainly a bad choice to get this thermometer based upon the type of cooking I usually do; but, I don't see much of a need for it in other types of cooking in which non-pen-like thermometers would be better suited."
4,Good for the price,Good thermometer for the price. I can't give it 5 stars because the thermapen can read temps in 3 seconds. But for the price this one is great and very accurate
1,Poor accuracy out of the box,Looking for indicators that would work and tried this one. Innacurate out of the box. Save your money.Recommend the Taylor 806E4L Weekend Warrior Waterproof Digital Thermometer instead.
1,Great expectations...that remain unfufilled,"I have been searching for a reliable, instant readout digital thermometer for a while now. I don't expect to find one that will survive a dishwasher or a nuclear holocaust; but I would hope at the least that it would survive hand washing and become a reliable part of my kitchen for the next year or so.Unfortunately, what I got was a cute, bright colored thermometer that died in less than 5 uses. I never submerged it in water; I always turned the unit off when not using it. I used it for less than a minute each time.I figured that it was something I did. Maybe it got hit by some stray bit of water (I had no idea that it was meant to be waterproof and had been treating it with kid gloves). It wasn't until I went online to buy a new one that I even found out that it was supposed to be waterproof.At $13-$15 dollars retail, I figure that my instant readouts cost about $2.50 to $3 dollars each."
3,Taylor 9842 waterproof digital thermometer,"I found this thermometer slow in reaching the temperature, certainly not instant. Furthermore, I found the readings inaccurate on several occasions. I bought the thermometer for tempering chocolate, but it was unsatisfactory for that purpose; I would get readings of 15 degrees variance in different parts of a small ceramic dish without a heat source. I also could not get accurate nor timely readings for other candy-making.It was accurate and consistent for boiling water temperatures, but took more than 10 seconds to obtain the reading. This is not satisfactory for candy-making."
3,OK but too slow,"My biggest disappointment about this thermometer is the time it takes to get a readout. It is far from ""instant"" - I believe the advertised time to get a readout is 8 seconds. Mine takes more like 20 to 30 seconds. That's a pretty long time when you're reaching into a hot oven or over a flaming grill. You might as well use a standard thermometer for a few minutes vice the 30 seconds, especially since you can't leave this one in the oven. I left it in for about a minute or so in a 400 degree oven and it came out with the display all blacked out. Luckily it recovered but if I had left it longer it probably would not have. I haven't tried to wash it yet so don't know about how ""waterproof"" mine is."
2,digital thermometer,I was very unhappy with the product performance. It takes longer than the time indicated in the user information to reach a stable temperature. The readout is very difficult to see as the characters are quite small and the contrast is not great. It was difficult to see whether the readout was f or c. The only redeeming feature is the battery saver which turns it off after a few minutes.
1,Stopped working,"The thermometer worked for a month or so and then could not be adjusted and it fogged up so you could not see the digital readout (it is supposed to be waterproof and I was pretty careful with submerging it in water because of other reviews). I bought it mostly to check the temperature of milk when making yogurt, so I am back to testing with my little finger like our great grandmothers used to. It was past the date to return it to Amazon and I have not contacted the manufacturer yet. I can not recommend the product to anyone, unless the replacement works well and lasts for years."
4,Works good,Works good and tested against other quality devices and is off by about a tenth. That is acceptable for me.
2,"Worked great, then failed.","Seemed to work great for a few months. I may have used it 5 or 6 times. Used it for pork butt and briskets on a Weber smoker.This morning I temped a beef roast after about 2 hours on the smoker and it read 180 degrees F. I thought, wow, that cooked fast and is way overdone.After leaving the thermometer at room temperature for a few minutes, it read 130 degrees. I put it under cold tap water and it barely dropped in temp.Tried to calibrate it. Turning the calibration screw has no effect.Too bad. When it worked, it was great..."
2,Way too slow.,"I'm sure it's a fine thermometer if you aren't in a hurry, but when I open the oven to see if the chicken is done, I don't want to wait 20 seconds for the thermometer to warm up."
1,"Battery casing fell off, not able to use","The battery casing fell off in first week, have no idea where it went. Now it's a total loss. I was never able to use it. The casing looks too easy to lose."
1,Short usable life,"After a few months of use the display developed a black area that hides a segment of the numbers. I must now guess at what the number is, making it almost unusable. I had always been careful not to get any liquid in it, has not been dropped or subjected to any extreme heat or cold. I was also expecting a much quicker response from this unit. I have owned a similar unit of this same brand for a few years but thought this would be a step up, I was wrong."
2,Stopped working,"It does take a while for the thermometer to register the correct temperature but I still loved it at first. However, even though the description says ""waterproof"", I don't think this product is waterproof. It stopped working shortly after I purchased it and when I opened the slot for the battery, the battery leaked. I exchanged the battery and it still doesn't work. The display shows only about 30% so it's very hard to figure out what the temperature is. Disappointed."
3,Waterproof?,"I bought two. One arrived with a dead battery. The other appeared to work well, but checking it a few days after use, it had failed. Upon examination, the battery compartment got wet and the area was rusty. The battery was dead to boot.I have yet to retest the rubber (silicone?) plug that seals the battery compartment to see if there is some inherent flaw or if it is just bad luck on one attempt.Beware."
1,Yeah right its waterproof!!!,"I bought this about a week back and was using it in homebrewing. First off, not even instant read. Its not even close. Having seen other reviews, I made sure NOT to put it in a dish washer. Instead, I washed it by hand. As soon as I was done, I noticed that there was a bit of water in the display. No harm right? WRONG! I pulled it out to use it again and at first the display was all 0's. Then I pushed the on/off off button to no effect. I tried pushing both buttons and then it started to read. I then tested the on/off button again and still nothing. This thing is the biggest piece of crap and I wouldnt waste the money on it. Needless to say I would return it, but I dont want to waste my time!"
4,A good thermometer at a good price,"I have a tendency to prefer digital displays over analog ones because analog displays sometimes require interpolating between markings to get the most accurate reading. This thermometer's digital display eliminates that sort of human error in reading the display.I bought this because I was roasting a pork brisket and wanted to make sure that it had reached the proper temperature. The design of this thermometer was well thought out. The display is easily readable, the user interface is fairly intuitive. The protective cap has been designed to be for dual purposes. A hole has been placed transversely which allows holding the metal probe without danger of getting burned by the hot metal of the probe. It also serves to keep the probe tip off the table surface, thereby preventing any contamination of the probe.Overall, I am quite happy with this thermometer and I would recommend it for any cook, whether it is used for professional or domestic cooking."
2,Terrible Taylor Thermometer,"For nearly 30 years, I've used Taylor and other brand thermometers for checking the temperature of baby bird food, which must not be too hot or it will burn their delicate crop tissue - and not too cool to where they won't eat enough. I've only had this waterproof thermometer for about a month and it is already not ""dead"", but constantly ""live"" and won't shut off. It's going back on the slow boat to China. It might still be ON if the battery holds out.As others have noted, it is slow compared to other products and other Taylor digital thermometers.The on button was always hard to depress. The readout was ok...no better than any other. I liked the length of it since it fit good inside a mug that is half full. I pray that we can get back to good quality controlled USA made products. I'm so tired of out-of-country JUNK. I try very hard not to buy Chinese or Mexican products, but it's almost unavoidable. If I can do without them, I do. I thought Taylor was US made. Not so!"
1,Doesn't work!,How wonderful I was invited to review this item. I tried it YESTERDAY for the first time. Doesn't work. Won't even turn on. Battery? who knows but I hesitate to invest in a battery since I am already out the cost of the item. I plan to check with amazon to see if they will make this right.
3,Convenient to read but not accurate.,"I found the resolution was 0.5 deg F at 212 deg F, not 0.1 deg as I recalled reading in the specifications. The boiling point of water measured 213 deg F and not 212 deg F. The display was easy to read. It cannot remain in a hot oven."
4,Part time grill master,"Nice item. It takes a relatively fast reading, about as fast as you will find in this price range. The waterproof feature is also a bonus and it is simple to clean. I did quite a bit of research and everyone pointed to the Taylor thermometers. I couldn't image that you could find a better deal for the price. Besides, never serving a guest undercooked chicken again is worth $15."
2,Good until battery dies,I had to replace the battery and the on/off switch no longer works. The display works intermittently if the battery is removed and put back in.
2,Only worked for 6 months :(,"I made bread often and use a thermometer weekly. I was happy with this model, until it stopped worked after about 6 months. I purchased a new battery for it, thinking it was the battery. The battery holder on the inside was difficult to remove to replace the battery, and unfortunately, it didn't fix it, so the battery wasn't the problem.I would not recommend purchasing this model."
1,unable to calibrate.,"This thermometer is always off by a few degrees. I have tried to calibrate it, but the calibration screw seems to be a dummy. Turning it either way has no effect on the reading. Perhaps it is a dummy. Or maybe the factory is just cutting corners."
4,Great Thermometer - Takes a bit to adjust...,"I really like this thermometer. It's well made, can be calibrated, and works nicely. The only problem with it is that it takes roughly 20 seconds to get to the actual temperature of the food you put it in. I'm guessing this is due to the poor thermal conductivity of the stainless steel the thermocouple is housed in. Oh I also notice that the display became fogged after the thermometer got wet, it should be waterproof. Maybe that was just internal condensation."
2,Annoying-Purchase this thermometer instead.,"I purchased 2 of these for bakery /candy work. One worked fine(temp was still off by 6-8 degrees) other was messed up. Comes to temp VERY slowly hence annoying! I tried changing battery, and calibrating to no end but still did not give correct temp. Purchased ThermoWorks RT600C and think it is a superior product-reads temp fast (tested great -freezing-33F and boiling temp 211F) for just a little more money it is worth it."
1,Three months later and dead,"Bought this thermometer based on the overwhelming number of positive reviews here on Amazon. Used it once to check the temperature of some cooking oil and then back into the drawer it went. Pulled it out six weeks later to use and it's dead. Battery checks OK, so into the trash this goes. No more Taylor products for me."
2,Not Waterproof,"The digital display was nice and easy to read...while it lasted. One good dunk in a pan of hot milk and this Taylor ""waterproof"" thermometer had liquid inside, under the display that would not come out and quickly led to its demise. The display was hard to read and the buttons stopped working. I purchased a similar thermometer at the grocery store, but it is not sealed, so if it gets wet, you can dry it out which has worked much better for me."
2,Not Accurate & Cannot Calibrate,"First of all, it arrived with a dead battery. I replaced the battery and it seems to work. I tested the temperature in crushed ice water and it says the temperature is 40.9 degrees F, about 9 degrees F too high (or 5 degrees C too high). I tried to use the calibration screw on the front and it does absolutely nothing to offset the temperature reading. I haven't tried in boiling water yet, but I have already lost confidence in the readings. My microwave oven has a temperature monitoring capability and when I tested the water set at 70 degrees C from the microwave oven, the Taylor unit says 90 degrees C - which I know is incorrect. The Taylor model is cheap, and mine could be a defect - or they could all be hit or miss. Should I risk buying another one? I just don't know."
2,Not for high heat,"I bought this for use as a Candy thermometer. It was recommended for this and yes it can theoretically measure temperatures up to 350 F. But it is only an instant read thermometer.When I used it I got it close to the pan and the soon the display started to cloud over in a dark gray color so nothing could be read or seen. So I returned it.Also, I should have been more suspicious about all the rave 5-star reviews. Reviews that said things like, ""This Thermometer is totally awesome"" Come on people, it's only a thermometer. It's not really going to change your life that much."
4,great temperature range,"The thermometer casing is not impervious to heat, so it cannot be left in the oven to continually monitor your cooking temp. The digital read out is so much easier to use than the older meat thermometer that I have."
4,Performs as advertised,My experience with The Taylor products has been consistent. They perform as advertised and the price points are exactly where they should be.
4,Better than expected,"I was skeptical about this thermometer as the last Taylor Digtial thermometer I purchased was a pice of junk: it would not stay on or in Farenheit mode unless you applied pressure to the sliding switches. However, this new thermometer is vastly improved with push buttons rather than sliding switches. So far, I'm glad I bought it."
2,Eats batteries,The unit arrived and didn't work. I replaced the battery and it worked for about a day and then stopped working. I changed the battery again and the same thing happened. It must be a dud. I was going to return it but it didn't seem worth the effort based on how inexpensive it was.
2,Pretty uselesss,"I bought this thermometer for meat and for candy-making. When I used it for meat, by the time the thermometer said the meat was cooked it was seriously overcooked. No way it was getting an accurate reading. For making fudge it was so unstable and moved around so much (the holder is also useless) that I put myself in peril. I bought a professional candy thermometer instead and have given up on meat thermometers because I have used several and they never seem to be accurate. I was happy to throw this one away."
5,"It works, it's easy, it's not expensive","This thermometer does exactly what I hoped it would; it tells me how done my meat is.Pros: Small, easy to read, easy to use, easy to clean, inexpensiveCons: Takes a few seconds to get a reading, can't leave it in the oven or grillFor the price, this is a very good product. 5 stars."
1,Problems are filled with errors.,"I was using this book to prep for the October 2009 Seismic Exam in California, and the example problems are filled with errors. It is maddening trying to evaluate yourself when you're finding mistakes in half the problems. For how much they charge for these guides, I'd have expected them to at least work through the problems and perhaps proof read the answers."
5,This was an excellent book.,"If you love animals of all kinds, and liked Watership Down, you will love this book."
5,A wonderfully lyrical book.,"I love this. I picked it up on a whim when I was very young and ended up stealing it from the school library, still have it too. This is one of those books I buy, whenever I see a copy somewhere, just so I can give it to someone or their kid. The story is enchanting, the biology well-used, and the characters are simply unforgettable. Storyteller still fills me with wonder.There are very few books that make me nostalgic for innocence and childhood. This one easily tops the list. Buy a used copy, for yourself, for your kids, for any reason at all. Treasure this."
5,Favorite gluten free brand so far,"I needed a gluten free elbow macaroni to make my husband's favorite macaroni & cheese, and had previously purchased another brand. After trying this one, it has definitely become our new favorite--the taste is great, the texture is good. You do need to watch the cooking time carefully, because it can go from ""al dente"" to ""too soft"" rather quickly, and it doesn't heat up with as nice a texture as the first time it's cooked. Since it's hard to find, I don't mind stocking up from Amazon, and with free shipping it's a no-brainer."
1,Disappointed,This product turns to mush when you cook it. There are other pasta products that are so much better. Save your money.
3,Delicate,"It tastes pretty good with lots of sauce - but you have to keep an eye on it when cooking so it doesn't break apart, the elbows don't hold its shape. Also, if you stir in sauce too much, it will definitely break and it doesn't store well in the fridge because when you reheat it, it'll break some more. Otherwise, it's a good alternative to wheat/gluten."
2,Is it Corn or Quinoa?,"Is corn the main ingredient or Quinoa? I see this to be good for the folks who need ""gluten"" free, but I want to eat it for the health benefits. Which one is the main ingredient? Isn't it a label violation if corn is the main ingredient (they list corn flour as the first ingredient)? I need to know! Until the manufacturer publishes that, I am not getting this product anymore! I am afraid to order any more of this brand!"
5,"Husband is gluten, rice and soy intolerant","The elbows of this brand are spectacular, the best of the Ancient Harvest brand. I made macaroni and cheese with them and like the flavor profile better than regular noodles. I think the quinoa/corn mix is much better than either element separately as either I think falls apart and makes a mushy noodle."
3,"Kiddo loved it, but stomach didn't","For some reason, my kiddo's stomach just doesn't like this pasta. It's a shame because it's a decent replacement. Stomach aches happen pretty soon after eating and last until bedtime. Sometimes it carries over to the next day. Tried it a few times hoping it was something else, but I'm finally giving up on it, especially after reading that others have had problems with it."
3,Great taste...but it has corn flour in it,For those of us who are gluten free and corn free this is not the product. Wish they had not put corn flour in it. The taste is very good...just disappointed. I tried it before I realized it had corn flour it. If you don't have a problem with corn...this is a good gluten free product.
3,"good quality ingredients, iffy texture","I love quinoa. It's a great plant-based source of protein. I also live a gluten-free lifestyle, so it would stand to reason I'd love a GF pasta made from the ancient grain. Here's the problem: it just doesn't cook well. If you overcook the elbows (or any other shape, I've tried them all), they totally lose their shape and turn to mush. They stick to the pot and strainer and don't look or taste good enough to warrant the price tag. I'm also not crazy about the fact that the boxes are less than a lb., which is more standard for pasta.I much prefer brown rice pasta, which you can get pretty cheaply at Whole Foods and Trader Joes. I think I'll stick to eating quinoa in its true form. If you want to try this out, just remember to really watch it during cooking and strive for al dente."
5,A valuable piece of the puzzle,"The difficult part in examining the era of the Nazi's is that dialogue is often problematic because of the labeling. The Church ,and especially the papacy are not easily defined in the question of the Holocaust. This is a valuable attempt to present one side of the equation and should not be dismissed as anti-catholic. However, there are other sources which differ from Golhagen's research and taken together we may find more answers.S.J.Tagliareni author of Hitler's Priest"
1,Goldhagen's New & Improved Definition of Anti-Semitism,"Many other reviewers have documented the incredible number of factual errors or mis-statements by Daniel Goldhagen. My comment is rather on his preposterous caricature of Christianity, Catholicism and the scriptures which permeates this work. Among the sections of his diatribe that will give you pause is his count of anti-semitic verses in the Gospels. Most who have read the Gospels will be aware of verses that make you uncomfortable but Goldhagen has the count up to 310! anti-semitic verses. When Jesus or John the Baptist (both Jews by the way)criticize Pharisee or Sadducee or other group that constitutes anti-semitism in Goldhagen's book. Hence by his definition any Jew (such as an Essene) who criticizes any other Jewish individual or group that constitues anti-semitism. By this standard I would suppose all of the Prophets were also anti-semites."
1,Poorly researched and extremely biased.,"This book, like many arguing a similar claim against Pius XII and the Catholic Church, leaves out important information and is filled with half-truths and dubious references. This book is a hinderance rather than an aid to anyone seeking the Truth."
1,Quite bold and presumptuous,"What makes George thinks he knows the heart of God??? George, MacDonald's ""Knowing the Heart of God"" assumes whom ever picks up this book is a Christian or is even incline to believe in (the Christian) god in the first place. I don't feel the writer did a very good job of taking into account the fact that in theism there are many concepts of God not to mention those who recognize more than one god. Knowing the Heart of God did not explain why George MacDonald is any more qualified than the next Christian to ""know"" the heart of God. Its interesting to note that if faith is all it takes then ALL religions are equally justified as Dan Barker so rightfully pointed out in his book ""Losing Faith in Faith, if faith. Woefully lacking in any critical analysis and mostly based the appeal to faith Knowing the Heart of God is the stuff of good reading for the Courier."
1,Where to get UNEDITED George MacDonald Books,This is for anyone (jacko97 especially) who likes to read the original author. I'm glad other's liked these edited books. The more that like GM the better. The original works can be found at: http://www.johannesen.com/ for hardback. Unabridged audio www.blackstoneaudio.com.:)
5,A Broad introduction God,"Stories, poems, commentary - all provide an introduction to the God of the universe who is much bigger and more unfathomable that most religeous organizations would have you know. Opinions, theology and descriptions fall far short of a life lived in pursuit and obedience to this God. He has and still is bigger than anything our minds can envelope."
4,"Very creative, with lots of gadgets","I really enjoy my dwarven mine set. The different mine carts and carriers are awesome, and there are lots of moving and interactive parts like the mine carts, the ore shaft, the catapult, the doors, and the hoisting mill. The dwarf and troll minifigs are really cool, my only complaint might be that more shields for both the dwarves and the trolls would have been nice. Lots of combinations of parts that I would not have thought of myself, like the war hammer and the anvil. All in all an awesome set!"
3,VTX Bags,"The bags seem a little flimsy. I'm used to the quality that you get with factory bags, (Harley,Goldwing)only time will tell.Mounting was a problem. If you don't have a passenger back rest (sissy bar)they would mount up fine. In order to keep my sissy bar I had to cut notches in the sissy bar support, make spacers to go between the sissy bar and bag mounts, and order longer mounting bolts.I had the bags repainted to match the bike color, they look great."
3,"Good, but not great, history of American colleges","Lucas provides a brief overview of highlights in American college history but he fails to go into enough depth on most topics. There are a number of minor irritations as well, such as the inaccurate index. Three excellent texts to consider instead are: ""The American College and University, A History"" by Frederick Rudolph; ""Higher Education in Transition, A History of American Colleges and Universities"" by Brubacher and Rudy; and the two volume collection ""American Higher Education, A Documentary History"" edited by Hofstadter and Smith."
3,American Higher Education,This item is a must have for all interested in pursuing a career in Higher Education Leadership. This book contains a wealth of information that will assist any administrator in efficiently running his or her institution of Higher Learning.
2,A disappointing release,"This is the Mozart's setting of the Handel's work, but there is no mention on the jacket notes. This is misleading to buyers. Overall, either the performance or the audio recording are acceptable, but here the problem is the video direction. Clearly, director Georges Bessonnet had no idea of what he was shooting: never his cameras are ready for soloists or choir or instrument entries. So you can hear the sopranos singing while you are watching the basses silent, or you can see the flutes not playing while the mezzo is singing, and so on. This is frustrating and irritating and soon it makes you want to watch or listen to someting else. A disappointing experience."
4,A New Face for the Messiah,"Beggars cannot be choosers. The first DVD production of Handel's Messiah packaged by Image Entertainment may not be premium production, but it goes a long way in bringing the Messiah to life brilliantly. The visual performance not only enhances the sublime melodies, it also highlights the skill, effort, and enthusiasm that goes into making this beautiful piece."
3,"""He was despiséd...""",There's really nothing wrong with this presentation of 'Messiah'; it's just not particularly interesting. The chorus and orchestra are large and unfocused. The visuals are dull. The bass needs instruction in English pronunciation. One can see equally good live performances in almost any city in the US and western Europe. One would be better off with a CD or the DVD of Stephen Cleobury and the King's College Choir.
2,Library safe,"Thankfully, we picked this one up at the library. It would have been a disappointed buy. We had bought the Kings College version a few months ago (previously mentioned by a reviewer)which I would recommend also... 5 stars.We thought this DVD was a little too sublime, as a matter of fact so sublime one couldn't ever ever ever hear the harpsichord let alone see the player finger the keyboard. The Mezzo soprano was without volume or any ummph. Maybe it was my DVD but the whole performance seemed to be recorded with insufficient volume. Panning of the camera was like being on a carousel horse whirlling around seeing blurred faces go by. Legatto without a strong downbeat. We agree it should have said on the jacket 'In a Classical Style not Baroque'.On the positive side ...the tapestries in the Abbey were nice."
5,Freedom to Marry is an exceptional film!!,"Freedom to Marry is a gripping film that puts a human face on the issue of marriage equality. I have seen this film 30 times and every time it still makes me laugh and touches my heart. Audiences around the country have adored this film. Comedian Margaret Cho is hilarious in arguing why same-sex marriage must be legal, from how ice sculptures at gay weddings will end the financial deficit to how it's really Britney Spears who is ruining the ""sanctity of marriage."" The incredible couples in this movie and their children will speak to even the biggest skeptics of marriage equality. This is a great gift for friends and family and an informative attention-keeping teaching tool. Re-live San Francisco's Winter of Love. The revolution will be televised!"
4,Neu! is worth it for just one song.,"It's the first song, Hallogallo.And this is despite the song is ONLY ONE CHORD FOR TEN MINUTES over a obsessive 4/4 pulse. But this chord, this chord is special. This chord is fwacka-fwacka-fwacka'd up and down like taffy.I defy you... DEFY you... not to shake yer moneymaker just a little bit listening to this. It will make you pogo like an idiot.The rest of the album is good, in a Teuton-angsty noise kind of way, with a few pretty bits spaced throughout. But Hallogallo... Hallogallo is special."
5,Essential!,"I'll echo the comments of a previous reviewer: if you like Bowie's Low/Heroes period, you cannot do without this (and the other two)! Also, for fans of Stereolab, you will be highly surprised by the similarities between Neu!'s hypnotic grooves and Stereolab's. Also, fans of Wire, PiL and the Sex Pistols (and late '70s punk in general) will find a virtual blueprint for that movement's minimalism. An extremely important ""lost"" band, providing the link between early '70s underground/prog/kraut rock & the later '70s & early '80s punk/postpunk/new wave. Not pop music! Hypnotic, yet high-energy... a clash of pastoral soliloquy and all-out noise (see early Sonic Youth). Once you buy one of the albums, you'll want them all... You won't believe it was recorded in the early '70s!!!"
4,I bought this for someone else,"I bought this for a friend who didnt want the evidence on his credit card. He loves it and added it to his collection of guitars he has to have but plays once in a while. The shipping time was great, got it within 2 days and it perfect condition."
5,AWESOME!,"I was looking for something interesting, something different from the norm and found Lisa Lawrence's 3 books. I loved it. It was like something from Eric Jerome Dickey with a better twist! I read all 3 books in 3 days. Not for the faint hearted, little old ladies! Stick to Brenda Jackson if you don't want something different, exciting, lots of erotica, and adventure that involves underworld dealings!"
4,Very nice,"This is a very nice chair. I love all of the additions to it (side pockets, carrying strap, side table, etc.) However, the only negative I've found is that when you are sitting on beach-type sand the back legs of the chair sink in - I don't think it's my rear, as I asked others to sit to see if it also happened to them - it did. But, nonetheless very nice."
4,Northern Comfort,What can I say....I am a full figured woman ....I needed a sturdy chair for a family BBQ....OMG..Did it work...I was able to sit and stand without fear the chair would break.Yes YES!!!!!...I would recommend this chair.
5,The Perfect Picnic Chair,"My husband I frequently attend outdoor concerts in the summer. For the past two years, I've been on a quest to find the perfect picnic chair; one that is light and portable with plenty of pockets for some of the inevitable ""stuff"" we bring along with us. While attending a concert at Ravinia -- Chicago's answer to Tanglewood -- I came across this sideline sports chair. Problem was, it was a bit more than I cared to spend.So I was pleasantly surprised when I conducted a Google search and discovered that Amazon -- my online site of choice for all my books -- was offering the same chair (minus Ravinia logo) for about $20 less a chair. I quickly purchased, and received the chairs within the week. They not only met, but exceeded, my expectations: they're very comfortable, very transportable, and very versatile. And as an added bonus, they come in lots of colors, including my favorite, red. I'm thrilled with this product and suspect you will be, too."
5,Sports Chair,"The product is a good quality, but the plastic swivel on the carry strap pulled loose before I even used it. The rest of the chair seems to be of heavy quality and I look forward to using it for a long time. I will repair the strap, but they should improve that item."
5,"Comfortable Chair, Sturdy and light weight",This chair is great for use in tight spaces. It's comfortable and the side table is handy for summer drinks. It's ultra light weight allows us to maneuver it through doors and up stairs effortlessly.
5,LOVE IT!!!,Very light weight and holds so many things. People always approach me at ball park and ask where chair was purchased. LOVE IT!!!
5,All-purpose outdoor chair!,"I'm very pleased with this chair. Padded comfort, plus table, pouches and general sturdiness make it a winner, plus the shoulder strap makes the added weight OK. I use it mainly for plein air painting, but plan to take it to other outdoor events this summer."
2,Too bulky,"I received this chair today and was surprised by the ""oversized"" seat. It is really big and hard to carry. I take the train to concerts and it would be very inconvenient to maneuver. The padded shoulder support on the strap was missing so the strap would dig into your skin after carrying this for a while. Also, the pockets were not as pictured. The picture shows 4 large pockets, but the one I got had 6 much smaller pockets and the velcro does not hold them closed because they are so small. This chair is probably ok for a big man, but I am 5'1"" and 70 years old so I am returning it. Too bad because I really like the attached table idea."
4,chairs,"The chair is very nice. I wish it were a bit lighter, however it is very sturdy and holds a lot of weight with ease.Great for a ballgame or fishing etc."
3,Not the Purple You Expect,"This would have been a 4 or 5 star rating if it weren't for the picture. The picture of the purple chair makes it look like a dark metallic purple. It is neither 'dark' nor 'metallic'. Its a lighter purple (more toward lilac) than the photo suggests. Having said that, it is incredibly light weight and very well made. I'm still going to use it because its a great quality chair. Just pretty bummed about the color."
2,"Too big, and too medical looking.","This is a big boys chair. I'm 6', 210 lbs, and I felt like a dwarf in this chair. If you are 250 lbs plus, then this is the chair for you. The back rest should at least start in the low back, but this one starts just below the shoulders. Result is that there is no low back support. The chrome colored frame is awful. The chair looks like something that should be in a hospital. I'm trying to return it but the return instructions to CostBuy are not easily found. I'm waiting for a response from them. Not real happy about that. Returns directly to Amazon are easy, but not the same to CostBuy so far.On the positive side, the chair is very light, and very well built and solid. The tray and storage compartment are nice features. If it were smaller, and the frame was another color, it would be a perfect chair."
5,Camp Chairs,I now own 7 of these chairs and they are the best I have found. Light weight and easy to carry. I wish they made them for young children.
5,Very nice chair,"Much more sturdy than ""bag"" chairs. Light weight and easy to carry out to the park or beach. Like carry strap! Stashes in car easily."
4,"An excellent story, but a little too much violence !","I enjoyed this film a great deal because it was in German and a great opportunity to attempt to understand it without the sub titles; however, the graphic violence was a little too much. It was exciting, but extreme. It was also a little far fetched, at times quite believable and then into the realm of improbability. Neverthless, it was entertaining and held my interest to the very end. If you can handle the violence, then this is an excellent film that you will definitely enjoy."
4,"piano,jail,germany,inmate,same gender affairs,blooding,police,incest,soldiers,war,history,car,trip,europe,drama,theatre,teacher","A story about she-psycho musical talent jailed for love crime a girl had not committed, her family and a music teacher supporting and inspiring young inmate to win a music competition.Nice music, nice performing and rather a fairytale of lives wasted with gloomy ending of unrealistic actions.Highly recommended special work."
5,Wow! I'm waiting for more...,"I purchased Finding Hope yesterday and finished it at 1:30 this morning. I have to agree with previous reviewers, this is definitely one of the best love inspired books I have read. Finding Hope really puts inspirational series fiction on the same level as non-faith based fiction. I, too, would have enjoyed the idea that this was the beginning of a series... I haven't read A Family Forever, but hope to do so soon and anxiously await Coulter's next project. Thanks and keep up the good work!!"
5,George L. Beam and the Denver & Rio Grande,"The black and white photo's were great. I found the text very informative. I had purchased volume 1, so I was already familar with the author and the photographer.I would recommend this book any rail fan."
2,Not up to par with Bardon's other work,"Not one of Bardon's written works, more just a collection of comments by him on various subjects, collected - I gather - from the notes of students, and then cut up and each prefaced with a ""question"" that seems derived from the comment after the fact.Bardon's other 4 books (which are more properly called his written work than is this one) are *excellent*. But ""Questions and Answers"" is forgettable."
5,a collection all bundled in one is classic,I choose this rating because it's a classic. It's an old school game and I am currently collecting my childhood back. I would recommend this game to any old head who played games since the 1980's
3,meh...,"Cant really complain about this game. It has tons of old school games some good, some ok, some bad. Its a interesting to play capcoms older arcade games that I never heard of but I lost interst fairly quickly."
5,Oldies are goodies,"The games on this collection are so much fun. I spend hours playing it by myself and when my nephews are here to play with me, the many multiplayer games provide us with a choice of challenges. I recommend this collection to anyone for the variety it contains. You will LOVE it. Just remember it's ""old school"" graphics which I really enjoy!"
3,"old school is here, but...............","Ho-Hum, I enjoyed vol.1 more. I just wanted this one for the 1st STREET FIGHTER. Even though it's fairly pathetic in terms of graphics & gameplay compared to any of the SF2 series. I just don't understand why capcom didn't just put SF1 in SF: Anniversary collection as an unlockable. But anyway all the other games were pretty good to see and play again, at least there's a lot of 'em and thats always a good thing."
1,THE PAST,"I BOUGHT THIS TITLE BECAUSE OF THE GAMES I REMEMBER AS A KID AND THOUGHT I WOULD ENJOY THEM NOW AS AN ADULT GAMER, BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE.FROM THE WAY THE NINTENDO CONTROLLED THEM AND HOW THAT IS DONE IS A BIT DUMBED DOWN. YOU DONT HAVE TO WORK HARD TO GET MORE LIVES OR SAVE POINTS YOU CAN DIE RUN OUT OF MEN AND NOT HAVE TO START FRESH FROM THE BEGINING YOU JUST RESTART FROM THE POINT OF DEMISE, AND SINCE I AM PLAYING ON A PS3 IT IS REALLY SMARTER THAN THE GAMES. KEEP THE MEMORIES OF WHEN YOU PLAYED IN YOUR YOUTH BECAUSE ITS NOT THE SAME EXPERIANCE NOW..."
5,A spectacular performance by Don Johnson.,"This is not a film for the squeemish..Don johnson's protrayalof the mentally anguished officer in a past horrific incidentin the Vietnam war was benumbing..as well as the supporting cast.Though this story is an indictment of war in general, it doesfocus on the duty an honor of the individuals involved. A mustsee."
3,disappointing,"I give this movie 3 stars only because I loved the book sooooo much. I re-read the book about once a year. I ended up getting a second copy because the first one was being kept together with a rubber band.The book is truely about a man who gave his word of honor to his men only to have every one of them break their word. It was an incredible book with powerful emotions and images. All of this was lost in the movie.If the premise of the movie/book interests you, please read the book first. If you see the movie first, you are unlikely to have any interest is reading the book."
5,'NAM ACCURACY PLUS MARITAL AND SON PLOT,"Outstanding acting and scenes from 'Nam that would likely make a baby boomer like me cry. Double plot with ""Nam guilt for 30 years vets have to live with plus man trying to keep family together.There are 58,000 names on the 'Nam wall but thousands more just could not live with it and went crazy or said ""hell with it"" and became skid row type drunks and pills or OD'd or picked out there tree or hung or shot gunned themselves. I salute all past and current vets. College kids didn't spit on them though. Highly recommended if you are the rare vet who wants reminded of the trip to the jungle and back to the world."
3,used movie,"Steelhead, the company that sold the movie, stood behind their product when I had problems viewing it. they refunded my charge and sent a gift card with Amazon for the trouble caused. I will order again knowing they will stand behind their product."
4,The End Zone that Wasn't!,"I had read that this Grumbach memoir was not as popular as her earier one but I found it very interesting reading. While she seems rather overly grim approaching old age, her mind is as active as ever and I loved reading about the transition to the maine coast. I have definitely become a Grumbach memoir fan."
2,Good but...,"The guide to Drakengard is great and all, but it's easier(and cheaper) to find a guide by someone on the internet. It really wasn't worth 11 dollars I paid for it. Unless you don't have an active internet connection, do not buy this guide."
4,Great stabilizer - Helped alot with bump steer and steering feel,"I have a lifted 2006 Silverado 2500hd with 37's, My stock steering stabilizer was completely shot so after looking around this seemed to be the best option for the money. It made a noticeable difference in the bump-steer and general feel of the truck on uneven roads and bumps.I've only had it on for a few weeks but I feel it was well worth the money. If your truck has 80k plus miles its defiantly worth changingInstallation was easy this came with all the hardware to install and took less than 45 minutes."
4,Steering Stabilizer,Easy DIY install with the proper tools taking inside an hour to complete. The Rancho RS5411 RS5000 really tightened up the front suspension on my 2004 Chevy 3500 1 ton 4x4 Duramax pickup. It feels much more secure at speed.
5,Excellent Mugs,I use these mugs to server frosty drinks in my cafe. My customers love them. They've also held up well from the rigors of hand washing and cafe use. Will certainly buy them again as needed.
2,Missed the mark,"One of the main reasons I picked up this book was the DVD that came with it. I am not surprised that none of the reviewers above mentioned it, because there was nothing of value on it! It was a ten-minute teaser that ended up referring you to the author's web site so you could buy a $25 video of his self-defense system. Since the book is nearly all text (only thirty-eight photos)it was assumed, at least by me, that the instruction was on the DVD. It felt like those times when you think you are watching a really interesting review of a new product on TV only to find out it is an informercial.Don't get me wrong, there is some good information in the text. But the scenario-based, physical self-defense instruction portion of the book was much weaker for lack of illustration--and the DVD is just a marketing trick to get you to buy his video after you have already paid $23 for a book (with a DVD!)."
2,Good on mental BAD on physical!,"The mental components covered in this book are good. However, the physical skills taught are NOT recommended for those who truely care about their safety.The author bases the skills on traditional martial arts training when they should instead be based on the realities of life-or-death altercations. The skills should be based on modern physiological and psychological research as well as adhere to the current understanding of motor-skill research.In short, while the section on mental self-defense is good, there are better books out there covering this subject. I would recommend caution for any reader who believes the physical skills taught in this book will help them in a life-or-death altercation. Also, the book is completely lacking in the area of de-escalation or verbal self-defense, which should be considered long before physical self-defense is attempted."
1,save your money,This book is a waste of paper. No information for anyone wanting to learn how to really protect themselves in here.
5,"Great product, great service","These sandal were a gift for mom. They are perfect, exactly as advertised. They arrived in record time, in perfect condition - including the box which made wrapping easier. I would order again without reservation."
2,Not What I Thought!,"Be Warned! This CD has the original artists but not the original versions. (there are only 4 tracks on this CD with the original versions- Birds and the Bees, Liar,Liar, It ain't me babe and Your the One)This was very disappointing discovery. On a positive note, this is the best recording of Liar,Liar I have heard."
3,Only A Fair Effort,"Don't get me wrong-I love Richard Stark's (Donald E. Westlake's) Parker novels. It's just that I find his stories about actor/thief Alan Grofield to be lesser efforts-although still better than 99% of anybody else's suspense output. And this ""Parker"" novel seems to concentrate as much, if not more, on Grofield's adventures. Parker is hired by the Outfit to bust up an independent island casino. He's approached by federal agents who want the casino's owner brought in for arrest. All of which makes for a dynamite Parker novel with a little too much Grofield."
3,Disappointing for a Parker novel,"This was my least favorite Parker novel so far. It felt very cookie-cutter, even as far as this series goes which relies upon the same simple formula in each book. It just felt very uninspired. Parker is still great character, but this book is really the low point before the introduction of Claire.J.Ja"
3,Don't meet Parker here....,"Start with ""The Hunter"" for a proper introduction to Parker. This turn includes federal agents and international intrigue. Not a neat fit with what I have learned to expect of Parker and his chosen jobs. Also - not sure why - but the Kindle version is peppered with typos, not common to the other Parker Kindle novels I have read."
3,Davidov's Memoirs,"Davidov is best known as a leader of Russian partisans during Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. One of the inspirations for his memoirs was Napoleon's subsequent denial of the importance of the partisans in this phase of the war. Unsurprisingly, then, the memoirs often seem argumentative, and present themselves as a mixture of personal experience, hearsay information, and analysis. The primary concern is with things that are worthy of being deemed ""history"" in the grand sense, and in order to make historical arguments, Davidov relies heavily on hearsay. Among his goals are (1) to document and to take credit for his own achievements as a leader of partisans; (2) to explain, to analyze and to critique strategic and tactical decisions of other leaders; (3) to explain important military events in terms of their less well-known causes; (4) to share his experience of famous military leaders (he gives a lengthy characterization of Suvorov, and decribes his observations of Napoleon)."
5,Just great,"The Cd was fine, I thought the songs had words, but it doesn't... though not the fault of the seller or amazon..."
4,Great soundtrack but I've got one question....,"Great movie score, love the music. There is the beginning of a famous song being played during the scene where victoria sits next to Danny and begins showing him how to play the piano, she plays only a few notes along with his assistance. I can't think of the composer. It's obviously not in the soundtrack.Thanks"
3,Ending song,"I believe the song you are looking for at the end of the credits with the woman singing with the destinctive voice is called ""Baby boy"" by: Thea. It is also on the sountrack with all 23 tracks. Heres the video link[...]P.S. try searching for her name and the song tiltle through your search engine"
3,BEWARE!!!,"If you already own the soundtrack to Danny the Dog, this is the SAME THING!!! This is bordering on a SCAM in that there is no mention anywhere on the packaging that this is the case...is that too much to ask???"
3,Massive Attack Still Have Their Edge,"I don't want to start arguments about 100th Window but this album is much better. It has a more electronic feel that's closer to 100th Window, however it has the much needed edge that 100th Window was missing. This album is totally instrumental but most of the tracks are enjoyable nonetheless. I would recommend using this more as background music because it gets very slow at times to fit the movie. The production is still very good and the tracks show the creativity and darkness that made Massive Attack so popular.I rated the Danny the Dog soundtrack (same movie) higher because they had the good sense not to include two very crappy bonus tracks."
2,Only mildly appealing from afar,"2 1/2A fair soundtrack album from the pioneering trip-hop group will not go over to well with fans expecting fleshed out, vocal-based singles. Playing out closer to a Dust Brothers disc, this meandering score may work well as background music, though rarely has little of substance to offer when examined closely. In between rambling keyboards and textbook beats Massive Attack does manage to throw a few tracks worth revisiting, but a majority of this generically diverse score fails to engage outside it's cinematic counterpart."
4,Fantastic album,"Great album and everyone should get it. One thing though. The end of the trailer had a bit of Muse's track apocalypse now. I was a bit dissappointed to not find it on the album. Never the less, great album."
5,"Same tracks as DannytheDog, w/ 2 extra tracks","This is an AWESOME soundtrack. Not that I ever expect less from Massive Attack, however, I bought the Danny the Dog soundtrack first, and now this one came out. Wonder why they released 2, I guess it was too obscure NOT to have a picture of Jet Li on the cover, and to have a different title. But hey, I understood! There are two extra songs on the Unleashed CD, however, they are not Massive Attack songs, so no loss. Just depends what cover you would rather have. I think the Danny one is pretty rad though."
3,"Once again, now!","I watched the Barber of Seville at the Met in NY in the early '90s and I thought it was a marvelous performance, giving justice to Rossini's intentions.This production is far from the one I watched even if this one had the benefit of subtitles.Too much movement onstage as one other reviewer put it. Very distracting, but I guess the director simply did not want to lose any of your attention. Talk about ""undivided""! I took me forever to finish watching it, pausing each time to relieve myself of the distractions. The cast was great though, especially the Count."
1,Hack work,"This production very disappointing -- vastly inferior to to the Nucci-Battle-Dara performance!Bring in a ""famous director"" and you ruin the work."
3,"Good singing, very annoying staging","The singing in this performance is very good, but it is hard to get past the incidental people who are constantly appearing on stage and spinning around. I can only assume that they are there to remind us that this is a comedy. Unfortunately, it only masks the fact that the Barber of Seville was created as a comedy and if played well is actually funny!The picture quality is very good. As for the sound quality, the orchestra comes through fine but the singing is a bit distant and has a definite echo to it. At some points the stage noise becomes so loud that it actually almost drowns out the singing.Although I like the singing in this release, I wish I had waited for a better overall release of this opera."
3,Bad VHS Sound Quality Ruins an Excellent Production,"The visually stunning and aurally magnificent production of this classic opera is impeded horrendously by the sound quality on this video, due, I suppose, to poor microphone placement and bad editing. Footsteps (and especially leaps or backflips or other acrobatics) on stage become massive, booming cannon blasts that jar the music. The orchestra often drowns out the singers, especially during the second act. I would recommend purchasing this production if you can find a good price, and especially if you have a predilection for good stage direction and excellent singing."
2,Awful staging.,Don't buy this performance unless you enjoy people who have nothing to do with the story running around waving sheets. It is distracting and adds nothing. Rossini did well enough without the chutzpah of the stage director who thought he could improve on a genius. The singing is not bad.I watched my copy once and threw it out.
2,unprovocative thesis,"The gist of Gruner's book is this: EVERY instance of humor involves a winner and a loser (like a game). Despite this being a decent observation that pertains to some humor, Gruner claims this is the case of ALL humor. In fact, he goes to great lengths to ""demonstrate"" how every joke or pun involves a winner and a loser. However, many of his examples are quite stretched to fit his personal grand theory. As far as I was concerned, his credibility fell apart after he refused to admit there were limitations to the generalizability of his theory; and of course there are limitations to every theory. Also, I found the book was quite long-winded and repetitive. It could have all been stated in under 100 pages. If not for the grandiose grand-theorizing and unnecessary long-windedness, I would have given the book 3 stars."
4,I love this digital fork!,"The ONLY reason I only gave it 4 stars was that it is a bit awkward to see the displayed temperature while the fork is in the meat on the grill. The angle of the handle is not quite right. However, I can now perfectly cook any kind of meat on the grill!"
1,cheap and built that way,"Used this unit 4 times. It now goes crazy with reading and sometimes just freezes up. You get what you pay for so I'm not too upset.Actually, it made for a difficult moment when I was hosting and BBQing a rib roast. Because the unit malfunctioned and without any other therm. I had to guess the time. Luckily I guessed right.It's now stored somewhere in a trash dump lol."
1,it has a very short life,"at the begining i loved every thing about it,then:1st : i discovered it can vary easly switch on & loose the battery charge if any thing comes near it, so i hanged it away from any thing.2nd : only after 2 short uses i found it doesn't work so i thought the battery was empty but it didn't work after changing the battery.3rd : when i was getting the battery out i found the spring at the battery's cover broke & even when i reconected the rest of it it still didn't work.IT'S SEEMS LIKE IT IS DISPOSABLE OR SOMETHING"
2,Never was accurate,We tried it many times and it never recorded the correct temperature. Cooking on a grill is best done by time and feel - experience is a better indicator than this product so says my wife.
2,Doesn't fit what I need.,I wanted it for use in the kitchen - it is way too big and bulky for that purpose. I am not happy with it as it doesn't fit anyplace in my kitchen or in any of my kitchen drawers unless I lay it sideways - then it takes up too much room.
1,not what I had ordered,When the scale arrived the box sticker was labeled 60LB hanging scale and the actual scale and box was a 30Kg scale. Needless to say I returned it but by that time the good deal was no longer available. I almost feel like it was done on purpose hoping most people would say o'well I will just keep it or send it back and spend more money on the right product. So if you order a 60LB scale don't be surprised if a 30Kg scale shows up in its place.
4,Finding words my grandma never had the patience to say,"I asked my Grandmother, what book would she suggest in learning to handle investments. When there comes a time when you have to listen to your grandmother about money, which is the day you realize that she knows much more about our world, and your interests, than you thought. You will want details. Details that only a book can guide and history can attest to. Insights into a broad picture, and the effect on the consumer. This book handles the lesson based guidance very well. It needs to be complimented by lighter material if you are just learning about the game."
4,"it's a good book, but I expected more","This is a good book for investors, but personally expected more from the author. In my opinion this book is good for newbies."
4,Revealing,"The main benefit about having read this book was the realization that one should have a professional financial planner in directing the management of one's financial investments so one should not do this ""solo""."
4,A must read,"A must read for any value investor. Finding companies that fit Graham's criteria will be nearly impossible in today's market, but still well worth the read."
5,Excellent book,I am a new investor and I think this is a great book to get started. Wonderful insight into the functioning of markets and investments.
4,the best of personal investing,"It is for people that are not financial skill, it is written in a clear way. It's very important for everybody that want to invest their money without listening misunderstanding ads."
4,Not for the beginner investor,"I am just a family man, struggling with a mortgage, four kids, and college tuitions. I bought this book to help myself get more insight into investing as I have received poor investment advice in the past. Honestly, the best part of this book for me was the commentary by Jason Zweig. I would often go immediately to the after chapter commentary, sometimes instead of reading the original chapter, his commentary was that good!I keep this book by my night table, and reread sections of it, while I work on my portfolio."
4,Should be mandatory reading in schools.,"I have been reading the intelligent investor for a couple of days now and just finished chapter 4. The book can seem a bit long but it is not. The arguments are easy to understand and comprehend. Graham argues that investment, as great as it could be, also contains significant risks and for long periods of times have not outperformed bonds when considering inflation. He thinks every intelligent person should have no more that 75% in equities in best of times and should have up to 75% in bonds in bad times. It is definitely a book worth reading not only because he reaches sensible conclusions and warns you not to blindly follow pundits but simply because it gives you overview on market performance by analyzing the historical data that should be mandatory knowledge for everyone serious about investing."
5,A must-read Classic,"A must-read for anyone who has a serious interest in investing. While very informative, I do have to admit the prose is a bit stilted and it was a slog in some places. The commentary by Jason Zweig was excellent and gave a much needed change of pace from the text.While it's true that many of the ideas presented here are now old-hat and can be found in many other books, there is something fascinating and sobering about reading the source. I think it will give any investor a historical dimension to their thinking that will prove valuable to them."
5,The intelligent investor,This book is so gripping that I am waiting for school to come to end before diving deeply into it. there should be no disturbances. Thanks guys. Order came through swiftly.
2,"5 star knowledge material, 1 star paper material","I'm not writing to review the quality of Benjamin Graham's knowledge and advice. If I were, I'd give it 5 stars, because Graham's clear prose is filled with useful data, anecdotes, and advice. And that's part of the problem. With a book like this, you want to read it with a highlighter, so you can quickly scan chapters back over again and pick out the most important parts. But if you try to do that with this book, you'll just go mad. I have tissues that are thicker are less-porous than the pages of this book. My toilet paper is made of sterner stuff. Highlight the front of the page, and the highlighter is almost more visible from the back. No matter how you try, using a highlighter on this book just creates an unwieldy mess.If you want a copy of Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor just to read through casually, this particular one will be just fine. But if you want to actually study Graham, do yourself a favor and find a better copy."
3,Edition quirks,"Classic investment book. However, each chapter in this edition is followed by a chapter of commentary by a journalist. I found this annoying and would have preferred an appendix with the information. The content of those additional chapters makes for some interesting reading but doesn't sit well between Graham's original chapters, in my view."
4,"Great reference, but only if you're already investing","I am not an experienced investor, and maybe that's why I found I did not understand enough of this book to make it worth my time. I am interested in jumping into the market (as soon as it seems like a reasonable time to do so), and picked up this book as a reference guide to help me get started. But most of the material went over my head.I think the audience for this book is mainly experienced investors or students studying finance. Indeed, Benjamin Graham taught finance at Columbia University.Now don't get me wrong, the book is brilliant. I think it probably is, as Warren Buffet claims, ""By far the best book on investing ever written."" But only if you are already a knowledgable investor. If you're just starting out, pick up a different book."
5,"Contemporized, not compromised","Can a rewriting of a financial classic be worth reading? Absolutely. Graham might have been the greatest value investor of his time, but his prose could be dry. Jason Zweig stays faithful to the original, while offering modern examples of stock market hubris that Graham certainly would have nodded his head to. Although Graham and Zweig share a message, it's easy to distinguish the one's words from the other: besides, the book uses different fonts for each. Zweig's comments on the absurdity of the dot-com bubble are worth the price of the book itself. The message is timeless: look at a company's fundamentals, before you look at the fluctuations of its stock price. Understand that you're buying a piece of a business, not a spin on a roulette wheel. Above all, be disciplined. The vast majority of the book's readers won't do any of that, human nature being what it is, but the quiet truths of Graham's approach will outlast Jim Cramer and his ilk."
3,Written like Stereo Instructions,I purchased this book based on several recommendations from traders I know and while the information is relevant the author clearly has a problem with his prose. It's difficult to read a very jerky work.
3,investing,"Haven't been able to read much of this book because the print is soo small. Larger print would be great. The concepts sound good, but it would take a very practiced eye to read it. Unfortunately, Financial folks are often more concerned with the cost of printing a book than the readability of it for the regular person."
3,"Get an earlier edition, unmarred by the chapters inserted by Jason Zweig","Warren Buffet is on record that Benjamin Graham's ""The intelligent investor"" is the best book on investing. Indeed Benjamin Graham was Warren Buffet's mentor. (Just search youtube for Buffet and Graham.)However, this is not the original book written by Benjamin Graham. Graham's advice has been defaced by gratuitously-inserted, lengthy, and uniformed commentary chapters by the journalist Jason Zweig. (It is misleading that Graham is listed as the sole author.) Indeed, one would conclude from page 507 of Zweig's drivel that Warren Buffet's Berkshire share repurchase plan is ""sinister"", when in fact it is clearly the most tax-efficient way to distribute company profits to shareholders.Get the original edition, it is better."
4,Basic principles of investing brought out beautifully,"Lays down the basic principles of investing and these principles will be valid for ever, irrespective of the conditions or environment. High level of clarity. At the same time this is not light reading and requires concentration. Explanations and clarifications by Jason Zweig are excellent."
4,Excellent for coverage of the basics,"I unfortunately first entered the stock market in the frenzy of the 1990s. I felt brilliant as my stock picks skyrocketed and like an idiot when they collapsed. The second adjective more accurately described what I knew about investing. I had heard about this book for some time and finally got around to reading it. It provides a common sense, basic approach to investing. Benjamin Graham writes in the gentlemanly style of the early twentieth century and covers a lot of fundamental topics. His passages are a bit dated and can by dry at times. Jason Zweig produces updated commentaries on each chapter in the more cynical and fast-paced style of the present era. He can be brutal in his criticisms of celebrity investors and advisors. Overall it is an excellent book that should be part of an investing library, but other books are out there that give the same sound advice in a more compact form."
5,Timeless Brilliance,"This is the only book you need to read about investing. In the land of snake oil salesmen, half-baked theories, Untrue truths and ultra short attention spans i.e. the stock market, Benjamin Graham shone a bright and lonely light to guide helpless souls. This book is an eternal and timeless masterpiece."
2,Is it only me ?,"I have read a few books on stock investment. Being the book labeled by many as ""a must read"", I thought I should read it too to improve my investing knowledge.Problem is, I find it hard to read the book. Maybe it is the content, describing the market, etc. while I was looking for the ""how"" of stock investing.I have tried twice reading this ""must read"" book. Maybe I will give it another go and this 3rd time will be my last.There are better books on the ""how"" of share investing, e.g., The Five Rules For Stock Investing, Common Stocks Uncommon Profit which I will give 5* each.My 2 cents."
4,Fabulous book but commentary is flawed,This book contains classic content on the difference between investing and speculating - profiting from rather than getting burned by the variance in the market - and being conservative. It also hammers home the message in both the text and the commentary that outperforming the market is no easy task. My gripe is with some of the commentary. Zweig exaggerates to make his point. He asserts that the market's pricing errors are rare when they are really a daily occurrence - and when trying to dissuade the reader from writing covered calls he claims it is never a good idea. A derivative is like any other investment in that it can be mispriced and can therefore yield an exceptional risk-adjusted return.
3,"Original is incredibly dated, commentary is decent","I won't discuss the content as by the time you read this you will have already known what the book is about, but I will discuss the jarring format: a chapter written by Graham followed by a commentary by Zweig discussing the previous chapter. This sudden switch between voices, time periods, and writing styles makes reading the first few chapters agonizing but by the middle you end up getting used to it. By the end I loved it.Many reviewers are poo-pooing the Zweig commentary, which doubles the size of the book, but I disagree. The original text is incredibly dated and by this writing I'd say 40% of it is inapplicable. Zweig's commentary is necessary to put it in a modern context, especially after the advent of the index fund. Nonetheless, Graham still managed to convince me that value investing is the way to go, that is, after Zweig's caveat that 90% of my investing money should be in index funds of course."
5,Great Introduction to Investing Strategy and Temperament,Buy this book if you are at all interested in the stock market or investing in general!!!! I've read a few books now on investing and stock market strategies and am also an economics major and I find this book to very useful. Everything that I've read in other books seems to somehow be originated from this landmark title. Well worth the price plus shipping; and buying it from amazon.com I saved at least 15 dollars!
5,what else do you need to invest?,If you are into investing you only need 2 books. This and common stocks and uncommon profits.
3,Read Warren Buffet's biography first,"Warren Buffett says The Intelligent Investor is ""by far the best book on investing ever written"". That's reason enough to read it.With classics, the real value comes from reading the original (which was from 1949). This revision already feels dated.This book didn't change my life but may impact yours. You may get more investment insights and satisfaction from Warren's biography,The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life."
4,Excellent advice for the novice investor,This is a classic work in the field of investing. It gives trustworthy advice to the new investor on how to safely invest for your future. This is NOT a get-rich-quick scheme. It tells you how to invest for a lifetime.
5,intelligent diligence,"The Intelligent Investor is a dense, informative, comprehensive, and quite difficult textbook that will reward diligent study with a depth of knowledge that would be hard to find elsewhere.That Warren Buffet, at the age of nineteen, was able to appreciate the wisdom imparted by Benjamin Graham in this book, is as much a tribute to Buffet's intellect as it is to the clarity of the text.Originally published in 1950, the book is in its fourth revised edition originally published in 1973, and brought up to date for the twenty-first century by copious footnotes by Jason Zweig.Highly recommended for the diligent intelligent investor."
5,Required reading for all investors,"I highly readable book. If you've ever thought of buying a stock you should read this book.At least chapters 8 and 20, including Berskshire's annual shareholder letters."
3,"Lots of great info, but there are better choices","After wading through hundreds of pages (and on a Kindle it felt like about 87,000), I did get a lot of valuable information out of this book. That said, I had to spend a week to do it and many of the concepts were still unclear. I've heard good things about the previous edition of this book so I may check that out as well.A much shorter (and clearer) option isUncle Bob's Money: Generating Income with Conservative Options Trades"
1,Information density near zero,"The intelligent investor does not ignore asset classes other than stocks and bond. Commodities? Real Estate?The intelligent investor should not be content with a 5-7% gain per year.The intelligent investor is losing money in the last 4 years (Warren Buffet included).The book thinks inside the box, the one useful observation (spoiler): ""Buy stocks like groceries, not like perfumes."""
2,Training Wheels,"Graham's ""The Intelligent Investor"" was a good book during its day, but it is now obsolete tech. It amazes me that people expect to make money by following the trading strategies outlined in this book. Half the traders in the world have probably read it, your grandma read it, the guy who drives the ice cream truck probably read it too. There is no knowledge to be gained by reading Graham, no edge you can gain. The best you can do is follow in the footsteps of half the world and become another fish swimming with the school, a cow in the herd.I am one of the top stock traders in the country with the trade receipts to prove it. The one fact of the market is that if you want to outperform, you need to have superior tactics. You need an edge. This book can never give you an edge. I would recommend it to a 9 year-old who wants to learn how the stock market works. Using it for trading strategies is suicide."
1,Expensive firewood,"Boring and conservative was too generous in my opinion. If this is the sort of book for you, then save your money, give it to a fund manager and go find some grass to watch growing. It is however safe and conservative, but you're not going to beat the market. If you've got the urge to do it yourself, start with Willian J ONeal or the interviews with top traders series."
2,"Book is still great, revision stunk","The book is still great, however the revision was the worst. I bought the book being as it was cheeper than the hardcover, and half the book was filled with this guy's (Jason Zweig's) insights on the reasons for the numerous tech companies bursting with the bubble. Everyone already knows what happened when the bubble burst. Its quite odvious that's all the revising author knows about securities, being as half the book was filled with comments about it. My advise, the extra money for the hardcover is worth not having to read the revisions."
5,A Classic Indeed!,"I finally got around to finishing reading this classic, and boy am I grateful. Ben Graham had a way of making investment analysis seems logical and common sense, not to mention those commentaries by Jason Zewig proved to be an invaluable resource to the accompanying chapters. The Intelligent Investor is a book that will have a permanent place on my book shelf as an enduring reference.-Pres.www.younganalyst.com"
5,Primer for Value Investing,"What can you say about this book?Well, this book is a primer for anyone interested in Value Investing. Concepts gained from this book are invaluable and provide a good aspect on how to approach value investing.I first read this book in college, junior year. Ever since reading this book, I have read many more on the concept of value investing and have tried to apply the techniques with some success. Concepts on ""MR. Market,"" and ""Buying as a Business"" are some of the concepts you will begin to grasp as you read this book. True not all of the technique Graham mentions can be applied these days but the underlying concept of this book still is a definite primer for any real value investor."
5,Is it a comedy or an action movie?,In some parts of this TERRIFIC movie it is funny. Like a dark comedy almost. But in some parts it is genuine action. It is a great movie.
3,Airport '75 meets the 90's Not too Well!,"This is just like Airport '75: flight attendant flying a 747 with problems. But instead of a hole in the plane its a killer stalking her. Lauren Holly is good in this movie but she can't save the movie. A better-made plot and better acting would have made this better, but without, the film suffered."
1,This movie is probably in everybodys Worst Movies Top 10,"Acting - lame. Story - lame. This is one of those Hollywood movies, where after 10 minutes you can predict exactly what's going to happen. This story is really, really stupid and childish. I got this DVD for free, but I still feel cheated because of my wasted time. :-("
1,The 747 that went nowhere,"""'Turbulence', you are not cleared for takeoff."" Those should have been the words from the control tower for this movie and kept a 747 grounded for a more useful (and cost savings) flight. The plot was dilluted, providing that only stupidity had created the problem. Personally I had a tough time viewing this video because it was tiresome and long. There was no plot, except like ""Airport 75"" and ""Executive Decision"" where both 747's have gone crewless and the plane this time lands by the computer Insturment Landing System (ILS)."
4,Dumb but Entertaining Disater Film.,"When a Psychopath Murderer and Rapist (Ray Liotta in a Over the Top Performance) abord in a airplane with U.S. Marshalls to fly from New York to Los Angeles to be in Death Penality. When one of the Convicts (Brendon Gleeson) killed four of the U.S. Marshalls and Two of the Pilots of the airplane. When the Psychopath gets loose on the plane, he slowly terrorise the crew of the plane and passegers. A feisty flight attendant (Lauren Holly), she could be the only one to stop the Psychopath and flying the plane to land in Los Angeles.Directed by Robert Butler (Up the Creek) made an Outrageous, Entertaining Thriller that destined to be a Camp Classic. DVD`s has an clean anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an sharp Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. A Box Office flop in the winter of 1997. This film did better on Video than it did in Theaters. An fun (If far-featched) action-thriller. Orignally Filmed in Panavision. Grade:B+."
3,Will good guy Lauren Holly come through?,"Handsome Ray Liotta, convicted serial rapist-murderer, may be a good guy after all. That's how it looks at one point, when he saves the lives of some innocent people by killing a bad guy. But that's not where the movie takes us. Ray Liotta turns out to be a sadistic murderer, and it's up to our hero to stop him. Our hero is stewardess Lauren Holly. Guess whether or not she wins. And while you are at it, guess whether or not she lands the plane successfully by herself. The best thing about this movie is that it holds your interest. The worst thing about it is that it is all so obvious and predictable, same old same old."
2,Twenty Three Years Later...,"We might know ""Airport 75"" right? Now Twenty Three years later, we have ""Turbulence."" Both are 747s, both have no pilots, both have to make emergency landing. This movie should have been aptly named ""Airport 97."" The only actor that could take a beating was the 747 itself. Everyone else was clueless and unrealistic. Only if stewardesses were given pilot licenses. Lauren Holly didn't need the hairspray that Karen Black needed in 75."
4,NOT A BAD MOVIE!,"this film isnt near as bad as people say...that is if u like good serial killer films....a must for ray liotta fans....this guy plays serial killers better than anyone ever...his eyes look like pure insanity....also see ""unlawful entry"" for another great performance as a crazy basta#$....some good action and pretty formulaic film overall however..but its Liotta who makes it worthwhile"
3,Good but unoriginal!,"Does anyone else smell AIRPORT 1975 when watching this movie? I sure do. ""Oh God there's no pilot! I'm a flight attendant who has to fly the plane."" While a hole in the plane is replaced by a loose maniac (Ray Liotta) running around trying to kill attendant Lauren Holly throughout the movie, the movie does offer some good action. Good special effects and a somewhat good storyline kept me going. Airplane disaster movie fans will find it appeasing."
2,Just keep the bird Grounded,"Boeing 747's are becoming more actors than air transport carriers. This movie is predictable and unconvincing when a prisoner break free in the aircraft, seizes the guard's gun and runs on a mixed emotions terror spree."
1,Go Figure!,"Turbulence is plagiarism at its best. Think Airport, et al. The loose cannon, Ray something (i can't even bother to recall his name) goes around killing all the passengers and the cabin crew in the 747, except blonde Lauren Holly, who throws in a rather convincing act as an unconvincing character who gullibly falls for the former's schemes to lure her out of the cockpit from time to time.Meanwhile, the pyscho, with nothing to do on his hands. goes around thrashing things around if nothing strangulating some other victim. The plot is silly, the cast are a either bunch of maggot-sized brainees (case example: a. policemen who takes aim at Ray and doesn't fire, just to be shot down the next nanosecond) or they throw in an OTT performance (that Ray moron, without a doubt), and the movie is a waste of time. Of course, needless to say, Turbulence would be a surewin hands down at the Raspberry Awards -- a ceremony held for the worst movies of the year."
1,Not worth it,I bought these 'sweeps' with the ImageMaker Light Tent Kit. They really are just construction paper you can get at your local walmart for a dollar. Additionally they came rolled up so tight that I could not unroll them flat. Ultimately I wound up leaving them all creased trying to straighten them out. They wound up in my recycle bin unused. Save your ten bucks and get some fabric for your sweeps.
2,Not Originals,"Well, I took a chance and lost. There were no clips of the songs so I could only hope they were the original recordings. Only ""You Showed Me"" and ""Little Woman"" were the originals. The others are remakes."
1,Not worth the $0.50 I spent on the used copy,"I bought this book after seeing all of the great reviews only to have both of my children ask why they were being punished, as well as if I was playing a prank on them,because what I was reading was so ""stupid"" as they put it. I did get upset with them for saying it was stupid but I could hardly blame them, the poetry, the rhymes and even the premise were better suited as a vessel to collect my dog's feces. I wish I could leave 0 or negative stars. Save your money and buy your children a sponge bob coloring book, the plot will be deeper, trust me."
1,dont waste your time,"Cassandra's Angel by Gina Otto was given to me as a gift to read to my kids, talk about a waste of time. I had heard some not so great things about her other books but thought i would give it a try. It was right on par with what i had heard and lacked many things except the ability to put my kids right to sleep. Definitely would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Not great,"First off, i received the wrong color. I ordered the black version as pictured and there was no option to choose colors anyway, but i received the white version. On the figure, the moped was sloppier looking that i thought it would be, the handle bars are crooked and the wheels don't move freely.You also have to insert the rearview mirror which is almost impossible to get in without gluing it in. The hat is set in place, then held there via the removable right hand which is easy enough to do. I mainly purchased this because i liked the moped, i like figures that have vehicles etc. So the wrong color is a huge put off and the sloppy modeling on the bike is disappointing. The figure herself is nice. It's a cute piece but i want it in black... i've emailed the seller so i don't know if they can make it right, i hate having to return stuff since i already opened. it."
4,Excellent Workout,"This is one of the best abs/butt/hips workouts I've ever experienced. I definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about toning up. It's not for the faint-hearted, but it works. I give this product four stars only because it doesn't come in DVD format."
3,Be careful with this,"This video is good; you do feel like you are doing something. However, the exercise really move to fast for you to understand the best form and get yourself into this. If you have had back or knee problems, then this is not for you. The butt moves are good, but the abs moves may cause your stomach to look bigger. I noticed after doing this video that my abs looked bulky, not lean. All I can say is be careful. I think routines from Denise Austin and yoga are more effective.Billy can also get on your nerves; he can be jarring."
3,Basic info.,"If you are just getting started this may be helpful to you. It goes over basic photography techniques and composition rules. I feel it leaves out much, and one may be better served by some of the other landscape photography books out there."
1,very disappointing !!!!!!,"i ordered this item for my grand daughter's birthday. the package is much poorer than the basket in the ad, like a regular candy bag that you can buy for a much lower price, in any supermarket. there were no silk flowers as promised. i expect a decent refund from this store."
5,Great Bag - Buying Another One Now,"I got this bag about 4 years ago as part of a Sales Conference Thank You gift. I've taken it to hell and back and it just finally broke last week, after 4 years of hard road-warrior use. I'm buying another replacement now and highly recommend this make/model.On a seperate but related note, I wear suits quite a bit for work so I use this in conjunction with a Tri-fold suit bag whose handle slips pefectly over the telescoping handle of this bag, allowing a modular/rolling/portable luggage system with this briefcase as the mobile/rolling base. Great for airports or if you're doing a lot of walking with your luggage."
3,"Very good for the price, but has one annoying negative","This is my first Overnighter, so I didn't really know what to expect. Overall, I think this luggage is very good for it's price.Pros:. Telescoping handle is easy to pull all the way up, and drop all the way down.. The other two small pockets are very useful. One has a divider that is perfect to put a tablet and a portfolio in.. The side laptop access slot is pretty useful.Cons:. I am 5'8"" and sometimes if the angle I'm dragging the luggage behind me is too low, the base of where the telescope goes into the back drags against the floor (instead of the wheels). This causes the bag to stop rolling. This is pretty annoying at times. This is causing early wear and tear at the area of the luggage. It would have been nice if the telescoping handle had multiple locking positions, so you can adjust for your height.. After a few uses, the area where the laptop goes in from the side bulges out."
4,Tuff little bag!,"I held off reviewing this bag because I wanted get at least a years use out of it before I did. First off you want to know about the wheels, right? I know I did. I roll this bag a mile a day over blacktop in 110 degree Phoenix heat and it is still going strong. All the sections are holding their integrity even though I'm not using them for their intended use.pros: very stong,durable wheels, tuff construction most sections holding their integrity after a year of tuff use and abuse.cons: garment strap snaps came apart after one month, feet on bottom are not long enough to keep fully loaded bag standing upright, zippers are starting to snag after one years use.I've been very hard on this bag this last year and am happy with its performance and recomend it to anyone who lives a mobile life like me."
3,One flaw,This is a sturdy case and it is easy to remove your computer from the side in airports. The only design flaw is the bottom of the zippered storage area which consists of just a flap that opens to the top of the computer storage envelope therefore smaller items get trapped between. Should have been a completely separate storage area from the computer slide in area.
2,Not the best quality,"I purchased the Rolling Laptop Overnighter because of the convenience of being able to remove the laptop quickly to go through airport security. Also, this Overnighter has sufficient storage for a shirt and pair of pants to change into at the end of a long flight. The case worked well for my first trip, but at the end of an eight-leg international trip, the telescoping handle is loose and sloppy. The rest of the case looks and operates like new. Unfortunately, the case does not have the shoulder strap hardware pictured and when the telescoping handle fails, it will be useless."
5,Het fantastische boek,Ik nam De Kristal Stap uit van mijn plaatselijke bibliotheek. Zij hebben een onderdeel voor nieuwe vrijlatingen en van de joue binnenkwam slechts. Ik moet zeggen dat ik echt van dit boek hield. Het was veel zoals wat ik hoewel jaren geleden toen mijn moeder werd hertrouwd ging en ik kreeg een nieuwe stap zus en broer die reeped verwoesting op mijn het leven ik wist voor hen. Dit boek indien geweldig voor enig kind door deze soort van dilema gaand. En ik genoot echt van het lezen van dit boek en zal nu uit je andere boeken ook gaan en nemen. Dit is een echt geweldig boek.
4,Decent Book,"I disagree with both extremes of reviews seen here. This book has a couple of typos, all of which are acknowledged on the authors home page, with corrections (www.chuckeasttom.com). But I do agree that proper editing and review would have found and removed these before publication. I do hope the publisher does a second edition, sans errors.However the book is easy to follow, easy to understand. You will get the basics of ANSI standard C++ in short order...but you will get ONLY the basics, nothing advanced."
2,"Easy to follow, but way too many mistakes.","This book really is fundamental and really easy to follow. There are though, a lot of mistakes. It's geared to people with no prior programming experience who want to start doing useful things quickly. If you want more solid and reliable knowledge, or are looking to program more seriously rather than for fun, I advise you to steer clear of this book."
2,Beware of the Madacy Label,"Once again, beware of the Madacy label which frequently does NOT mention that these are NOT the origional recordings. Madacy goes to great lengths to mention ""Origional Artists"" but frequently misleads by re-recordings of the origional songs. Anyone familiar with this music can tell the difference."
5,Rifle Is For Long-gunners,"Always something of interest to shooters, especially of long guns. Good coverage of rifles from sporting new/recent/19th century or older through military from pre-WW1 to current. Not a magazine for the rapid fire auto fanatic, but the bolt/lever/pump gun shooter, collector and sportsman will enjoy it."
5,Wow!,Learn some new ways iof looking at color ar expand what you think you know. Lovely ideas and great things to put into use.
4,Helpful for colour selection,"I bought this book to help me chose my fabrics for my future quilts. It explains in great detail what goes together, and how to combine colour, texture, etc. I found it very interesting to read, and hopefully I know what to buy for my next quilt."
4,OnYer Toez,"This is the first blaggers' album, the cd includes their first two singles and is their Oi! era, powerful left lyrics, a lot of attitutude and includes two covers, 4 skin's ""Wonderful World"" and Ramones ""Blitzkrieg bop"". Highly recomended to Oi purist who likes bands with left attitude"
4,What a great book!!!,"I just barely got this book and I finished it in one single day! I could not put it down. Alot of the feelings she was feeling were things that I would be able to relate to. I simply loved it. This book has the power to make you happy make you frustrated and make you angry or anything else that this character, Althea, was feeling. I said if before and I will say it again, this was a really good book!"
2,The vampires promise,More on a preteen level. Wasn't aware of interest level when checking it out. Needs to be reviewed by younger reader.
4,Happy,"Was happy with the book. Wish it would have come before Mother's Day, but still enjoyed the book."
5,Lovely,"This book was purchased for my mother, who called to ask me why I gave her a book that would make her cry! Actually, she loved it. It's a great book, as are the so many other in this series. The only complaint I have is that eventually the book ends."
5,Grandma says she cant put it down!,Bought this for granny for xmas and when the internet went down she couldnt put this book down even after the net was back up and running...says it is a great book and full of funny and thoughtful stories. Would buy again and highly recommend.
4,Should have been a hit,"I agree with Grant, the Aussie, in most respects. I did not notice the country influences as much as I did the even harder rock than many BC releases. True, ""Far From Me To You"" is a standout track and one of my favorite BC tracks, but it is one of the few here to have an overt country influence. ""Ships"" from the even better release, The Buffalo Skinners, has a stronger country flavor. The superlative, ""Driving To Damascus"", has a couple of country tinged tracks, as well. By the way, you gotta get this one just for the unplugged version of ""In a Big Country"". This cd has 16 tracks and is a good value for the money. Not the place to start your BC collection, but you'll have to have it."
4,A super effort!,"This 1995 cd from 80S group Big Country is just wonderful. While not quite as catchy as some of their other efforts, the straight up rock and roll value is much increased! Simply put, it rocks and why I did not hear this on the radio is confounding. Standout songs include ""You Dreamer"", ""Take You to the Moon"", and ""Blue on a Green planet."" There is even an acoustic version of ""In a Big Country"" and a remake of Lou Reed's ""Vicious"" which are both a lot of fun. As usual, Stuart's writing is superb and both hopeful and hopeless."
1,Why spend the money?,"Big Country had a great sound back in the day, but that day's gone now. Try listening to Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot instead--it's simply the greatest cd ever released in our lifetime."
1,Dissapointed,"If you're looking for strong Maori male vocals and heavy drums, this is NOT the album you are looking for. I unfortunately made that mistake. It's a lovely album, sure, but more choral and quite light. Not at all what I was looking for and now I'm stuck with a CD I'll rarely listen to."
4,Chuck Norris: Great Self-Defense and Work-Out Video,"Chuck Norris teaches good beginning self-defense techniques - punches, kicks, and more. The video is 3 parts: Instructional (1 hour), Work-Out/Review (22 minutes), and Advanced Demonstration (5-10 minutes).After going through the instructional part once, I was able to pick up on the techniques fairly easily, and practice often with the 2nd part - the workout. I find the workout to be very aerobic/cardiovascular, while practicing self-defense techniques.I would have given this video 5 stars, except that after seeing the advanced demonstration, I wanted Chuck to teach me more. He mentioned that they would be in later videos, but, to my knowledge there are no later videos. (I believe this was filmed in 1993. Maybe ""Walker"" is the reason.)Chuck, PLEASE GIVE US MORE INSTRUCTIONAL TAPES!!!It's still a worthwile tape! Good deal from Amazon, as I have seen it as high as $39.95 elsewhere."
2,Slow and Unmotivating,"This DVD is slow and unmotivating. The women who are in the video look like bimbos (though I hate to say that). The exercising is slow and doesn't really work you out. It IS good for SELF DEFENSE only, not as a workout!!"
5,The best boots ever!!!,"I wore these right out of the box, onto the very rocky, 10 mile, trail. My feet have never, let me repeat, NEVER, felt this good. In spite of having sore toenails, from a previous hike (and long descent) in other boots, my feet did not have a sore spot. I did a long 6 mile descent and my toes tips never touched the boot. I only wish they were a little stickier and lighter."
1,Better off with a $5 wine vacuum.....,I was very excited about this product as I like the corkscrew they make. Unfortunately this product simply does not work. We have thrown it away and gone back to the $5 models that actually preserve the wine.
1,"Rabbit Vacuum Pump a ""Fizzle""","I like my Rabbit Corkscrew, and when I saw that it had a companion, The Rabbit Lever VACUUM Pump to preserve the wine in an opened bottle, I was sure that it would be the same quality. BUT, beware the so called less effort-just 4 swift pumps of the lever (or even 10 pumps ) does a minimal job of creating any vacuum in the opened bottle. A real bust for $30.00. In addition , we have had no response from our complaints and return of product from the Metrokane Co."
1,This item does not work,"This product simply does not work. The vacuum is so weak that it does not preserve the wine, even for a day. I have used a Vacuvin for many years and it is a far superior product at a far lower cost. We bought this item because it appeared to be easier to pump than the Vacuvin -- and it is. The reason: it doesn't preserve the wine. I am seeking a return and refund, either through Amazon or Metrokane."
2,Better looking but poorer vacuum than the alternatives,"I bought this, although I already had the Vacuvin vacuum pump, because it looked more durable and easier to use. It IS nicer looking than the white plastic vacuvin (although it's grey plastic not metal), but it takes more pumps to create a vacuum and the vacuum is much weaker than with the vacuvin. since the metrokane is also twice as expensive, you'd be better off buying the vacuvin."
1,Do not buy this product.,"Like the majority of the reviews relating to this product, I was disapointed in it's performance. I am able to form a seal and create a vacuum, however, hours later the vacuum is gone no matter what bottle it is being used on. Do not buy this product."
3,"So so, could be better","The vacuum effect is not as powerful as I had imagined. I think you have to pump quite a bit more to get a modest vacuum in the bottle. You can tell the vacuum is on the weak side because if you pry off the top, the suction is not impressive. On the other hand, the smaller wine bottle cover allows you to fit the bottle better in the fridge when compared to other models where the whole vacuum mechanism must remain on top of the bottle."
2,Plastic snapped off...Now it's useless.,"i've used my rabbit for about two years. it took about 10 pumps to get a vacuum into the bottle. no problem with the stoppers except that on some wine bottles with a larger opening, they did not fit snugly and wouldn't hold a vaccum. yesterday, while pumping i heard a 'pop' and found that the plastic suction device in the middle had snapped off. the thin plastic connection inside had just separated, rendering the pump useless. i'm going to try to epoxy it back together to see if i can fix it, but a better design would really be in order.i can't recommend this until they make a stronger connection inside."
1,Does work worth a flip,"To get it to work you need to hold it just right, and then the only way you can tell if you have done it right is to let the pressure off. So all in all it's pretty useless."
1,This product is useless,"I agree with all other responses! I thought it was just me, but this product doesn't work! No suction, no vacuum, no seal, lots of vinegar!"
2,Disappointing performance,"I receieved this lever type vacuum pump as a gift and used it often for just over a year, but then it broke; a plastic piece that was part of the gear mechanism snapped, a gasket came out, and there was no way to fix it. It only worked marginally before it broke, giving a fair seal that leaked air in after a couple of days. It was also bulky and difficult to store, so I'm looking to replace it with the Houdini or Vinovac which both get much better reviews."
1,Poor Product,"This device has two major flaws, both of which alone would render it useless. First, it simply does not pump well. One has to work a lot and there is almost no result. Second the stopper breaks after a couple of uses. There are three rubber rings around the stopper that are meant to keep a tight fit with the bottle. However, these rings break off after a couple of uses, and the stopper does not work any more. Simply a poorly designed product."
5,Great book for horselovers!,I think Bonnie Bryant writes great books.The Saddle Club is a good series for all the serious horsemen today. Read this book and the others!
4,An exquisirely crafted alternate history,"I've admired Silverberg's craft in devising a world utterly different than our own, where the major powers are the Aztecs and the Turks, and in painting the subtle nuances of such a world, to the tiniest detail. So, I cannot understand why he makes his main charachter commit such a stupid mistake, when the teensiest bit of sense would have commanded a different choice.I was somewhat disappointed. But the intuition of the gates of worlds and of possible realities is wonderful. It reminds me when in Dick's The Man In The High Castle, set in a reality where Hitler won, someone circulates a fantasy where the events have gone othervise...a similar scene occurs when the portly mentor of our not overbright protagonist delineates the , to us, REAL story, and becomes suspectly heated in the telling. Was he an Universe shifter, like other protagonists of Silverberg's stories?"
3,ho humm,"I should of done alittle more reaserch on this book before buying it. I thought it would be on diferent boat designs, not about two boats being built. Could still be intresting."
1,disappointing,"A nonfiction work, this reads like a well-padded magazine article written by someone who doesn't seem terribly interested in his subject matter. This of course makes you wonder why he bothered to write this book. (apparently in the past he's written mostly about famous chefs!) The book has its moments (few and far-between), but the author gets carried away with the research, giving you all the technical minutiae of boat construction--way more than you need, which will put most readers to sleep, even if they're boatbuilding enthusiasts. The real focus of the book (the lives of the men who build these boats) gets utterly lost in a morass of boring details. All in all, very unenlightening."
1,disappointing,"This reads like an overly-long magazine article--it's greatly padded. The true focus of this book (the story of the lives of the men who build these boats) is often muddled, and displaced by excessive details on boat building techniques. Such minutiae serves to distract the reader. There is a book here somewhere, but the author hasn't quite found it yet. On the plus side, the writing style can be engaging at times."
4,Wooden Boats,"If you have a fondness for wooden craft, you'll find the book interesting, readable and generally enjoyable. From an editorial point-of-view, it's a little uneven. Partly a technical book, it suffers from the author's complete lack of prior background in his subject, resulting in too much concentation on fundamentals. But in places the book soars with a romance I did not expect from someone not ""boatstruck."" Perhaps this is born of the author's obvious respect, and I suspect, admiration for the men who build them. It's a good read, and one I'll hang onto in my library."
5,gets ya motivated to build your own.,"im nearly done with this book,and ill tell ya,,what a book it is.its a enthralling story about a shipyard and the boats they build. it tells about the boat shop,and nearly what it might feel like being/working in one. i for one would love to have a job in one,,money or no.(being disabled,,it aint gonna happen)the boats they build are amazing,and the writer describes them in a way that i can imagine what it will look like even before i check out the pictures.the best part of this book,,is its a true story.if there is a boat lover in your life,,or you happen to enjoy all things boat,,this book will not disapoint.buy it and enjoy,roystr"
3,"Fair, at best","It's cute, works reasonably well, but won't last long. Really cheap guts on this one. That's too bad, because it's a cool looking watch...."
5,Who's been playing with our fairy tales!!!!!!!!,I first heard the original Broadway Cast recording of this show and fell in love with the idea of turning traditional fairy tales upside down and inside out to create an exciting new look at these much loved characters ad stories. I have seen 5 different versions of this musical. The scope is incredable and each production has been totally different. Read on and let you imaginiation run away with it's self........happy reading (and singing)
5,A Wonderful Book,This is a novelization of the smash Broadway hit. It follows along with the show perfectly and has amazing illustrations by Hudson Talbott. It was rereleased just in time for the Broadway revival which starts in April. This book is a must have for any Sondheim fan.
1,Not what it appears to be,"The play ""Into the Woods"" not only contains sinister elements, but has an overall dark message to convey. It preaches moral relativism as blatantly as any catechism teaches religious doctrine. It teaches is that lying, stealing, cheating, and even murder can be justified as long as it is not against one's perspective on life. Also, that life is grim and experiencing things forbidden will help you. This religious doctrine of corruption is conveyed through the story and through specific lyrics of the songs."
3,Philadelphia Flyers Door Knocker,"Product arrived with minor defect. Had it exchanged with no problem. A little disappointed in quality of product, was expecting better craftsmanship. Brass finish looks kinda on the fake side."
5,This is the Ticket,"Today I passed the OCP upgrade exam with a 52/60 score and this book is principally responsible. I used the practice exams to find holes in my knowledge and revisited the text in those areas. By the way, the 10g Upgrade exam is a lot more work than the last two upgrade exams. Prepare to spend more time studying. I have only one criticism: the book has to much detail in some areas(the lesser new features like merge, model, etc.) and leaves a few things out of the big-new features. All in all, this test covers 92% of the material for the test. Aside from the upgrade exam, the text is also an excellent reference and learning book."
4,A good book,"I used it to pass my DBA OCP exam. There are a few errors in the book, but that is to be expected. You have to learn everything to be prepared for the exam. It is also wise to get a second book so you can track omissions in this books by answering all the questions and sample exams in the other book."
4,Will do the job,"This book will definitely teach you the new features in 10g and prepare you for the exam. The material definitely covered the test areas well, although often there are mistakes in the text and questions. The online tests and flashcards are very useful and (good or bad) provide additional information that the book does not cover.After doing 9i using the Oracle Press books I believe I will continue with this series when the next release comes out."
4,Mark's review.,"The book is good, but I haven't read it all. I mean, it wasn't ripped or anything, but I thought it was hardcover. I know the website said it was softcover, but I didn't see it."
1,Useless!,"After taking the exam three times using this book, I finally realized that the book was missing a lot of information that was on the actual exam. It is poorly written, and the examples are poorly illustrated. If you want to pass the exam on the first try, I do not recommend this book! The CD software that came bundled with this book did not reflect the questions on the actual exam(?) The authors of this book need to head back to the drawing board and start all over again. What a waste of time and money...."
4,Diagram for Rockin',"It would be easy, upon hearing their catchy chords and spur-of-the-moment lyrics, to dump No Motiv in the popular pop-punk category and be done with it. But, such a label ignores the depth of the band's sophomore effort, `Diagram for Healing'. At first glance, the album may seem predictably poppy, but more careful listening reveals a deeper, darker, and more brooding feel. Tracks like ""Broken and Burned"" have the distinctive delicate-yet-rockin' sound of Jimmy Eat World. In fact, a Jimmy Eat World-esque feel permeates the album, underlying the traditional pop-rock. The heartfelt lyrics reveal regret, resignation and hope for the future. Trevor Keith of Face to Face produced the album, and you can hear it. The album as a whole underscores No Motiv's growing confidence as a band, and a new level of maturity for their music. Jeremy Palaszewski, leader singer, speaks from the heart when he says, in ""To The Roots"", ""Yeah, we're gonna rock and roll..."""
5,absolutely amazing,"when this cd first came out, i listened to it for about a month straight... when i was in the car, at home, on the computer, at school, anywhere. this is just one of those albums. standout songs are: broken and burned, give me strength, savior... and the absolutely best no motiv song ever: born again. i can't even begin to tell you how completely amazing this song is. also, the recording quality is excellent. if you're going to buy this, make sure you don't have any other cds you're listening to right now, because this one will take over your stereo and who knows when it will let you have it back."
5,Many great Hogan Matches,"Let's face it-- if we wanted a true hulk anthology a dream set would be about 12 discs and would cover more of his rivlaries, matches, etc. Still, this set includes a whole lot of great Hulkamania moments and I can't complain. I think they did a pretty sweet job choosing the matches honestly, though I would have liked it if Hulk's fight against Sid was included as well as his cage match against flair at Halloween Havoc 94 rather than the fairly lackluster first fight at Bash at the Beach. I still give this one 5 stars because it is one heck of a collection and a definitive purchase for a Hulkamaniac."
1,Mediocre talent gets his own DVD anthology,"No one can deny that Hulk Hogan was the biggest single star in Wrestling in the 1980's but he was only has good as his opponents made him look. He got by on the fact that he was in Rocky III, and just happened to be in the right place at the right time. His skills are horrendous, and his opponents made him look larger than life. 20 years later at near 60, Hogan still tries to hang on to his cult status any way he can. Buy this for nostalgia, but hopefully Hogan will fade into the sunset finally to give the American public a break from having to look hat his half mullet."
5,Not Enough NWO...but I Love It!!!,"To make a long story short, this anthology is a must have for fans of Hulk Hogan and 80's wrestling in general. Many of his pre-WWE stints, AWA stints, WCW and WWE stints are here. Only thing is...you want to be careful to buy the Wal-Mart version of the collection because it features a bonus matches dvd as opposed to Hogan Knows Best."
4,Icon,"Not a bad release, most of matches are on other dvd's but it's a good trip down memory lane and a good dvd to help him understand how ""over"" Hogan was."
5,Greatest of all time,"This dvd is great and more matches on it more than hulk still rules dvd ,now some people are complaning about some things,um i dont know why ye sthe hulk first dvd was great dont get me wrong but it missed a lot.hogan became hollywood in wcw and that dvd only had one wcw match?werid huh at least this dvd has more wcw fights on it and more wwe fights like the warrior fight from wm 6 and macho man from wm 5 and plus from more currnet like thiple h and hbk fight on thier. well naywaz hulk is a god of wresling and this is a must owen i been a wresling fan for years this dvd is a must get."
4,Pretty Good set,"Even tho this dvd has been out for a good 2 yrs. I finally broke down and bought it yesterday. I found it way cheaper then Amazon has it listed for, at a local K-Mart for $20. One of the main reasons I bought the set was for the classic WCW matches."
1,The man that ruined pro wrestling,"Hogan was a ego maniac. He held talent down and gave jobs to people that weren't even great wrestlers. This dvd is nothing new in the Hogan cannon. They released a dvd set of Hogan matches that had better matches on the other dvd, Hulk Still Rules. The WCW matches that are new- facing Giant and Sting, are a complete waste of dvd transfer. I bought this set because there was an extra disc with a all new matches and he was a good showman and he could wrestle a good match on occasion. The problem I have with Hogan was reading about him in the Death of WCW. Now you can call me bias, but I do believe they were right about Hogan. He is ego maniac and wont job to wrestles younger then him and dont put over anyone younger either."
3,Upgrade/Downgrade,"I own both dvds that WWE has released of Hogan. This set is a not much of an upgrade, expect for the bonus disc from Wal Mart. The WCW matches that I craved were a huge disappointment and I wish they would have played the whole watch of Bash of the Beach instead of what ive seen before. WrestleMaina matches are great, but who hasn't them and let alone own them? Hogan has faced Savage almost a thousand times and all they can give us is the WrestleMaina 5 match? XFW was a surprise, but the dvd are a rarity to find. I saw them a the Wal Mart and they were gone the next day it seemed. I think the WWE should take a poll of which star deserves a set , they have countless stars they have neglected. Randy Savage probably upset Vince and that is why he wont get a set; Ricky Steamboat is the same, although he is now employed by WWE. There are more and more stars but I guess WWE neglects"
3,Hulk Still Rules is better.,"The absolute gems in this DVD are the Hogan VS Bockwinkle match and the Hogan VS Andre match from 1980 (which I was expecting to be the match from Shea but its not, which is awsome) the Hogan VS Studd match from the Garden in 1984 and the NWO matches later in the set. The typical anoyances are here with the addition of Real American to the AWA championship match dubbed over whatever was playing. Most Hulkamaniacs know that Real American wasn't used until later years. Plus they got rid of any music by Jimi Hendrix (including NWO's theme), just pay the royalties McMahon! At least Jesse Ventura's Commentary is here. Other than that the majority of the matches are already on other DVD's that WWE has released. The Hulk Still Rules DVD has much more variety and is not so heavy on Hulk's major matches, although most are there. If you buy this set and Hulk Still Rules DVD then you would have THEE ULTIMATE ANTHOLOGY!"
2,Content Great - Book Binding Falling Apart,We have had this book for not even a month and it is falling apart. We tried to fix it so it is not returnable now. The content is great but useless because the pages are falling out.
3,This coulda' been a contender,"An opportunity lost. So much more could have been done with this, but was not. The entire DVD should have contained more details and more video of the beeter players. I was not impressed with parts of the documentary and do not recommend the expenditure for this rather short history of the games greats."
5,My dad loves this video!,"I gave this video to my dad for his birthday last year. My sister gave him the accompaning book. He loves them and references them often. My dad lost his father 2 years ago and the greatest bond they shared was baseball. I can see the hands of time turn back as he watches the tape or turns the pages of the book. I know he wishes Grandpop was here to share it with him, but I think this helps him remember all the great memories they shared thanks to the game of baseball. He enjoys reliving those great sport moments made by the heroes of yesterday and looks foward to watching the today's heroes make their marks."
3,Why not show the whole ceremony?,"The DVD was not bad. The bios and stories were well done. The only reason that I bought the DVD was to watch the ceremony. I think that it was misleading that it did not state that the whole ceremony was not included. Again, not a bad DVD, but don't expect the ceremony."
5,"For a baseball fan, the perfect end of the century gift","This home video has unique and never seen video and film of the centuries greatest 30 players: Stan the Man, Big Mac, Ernie Banks, Junior,The Train, Walter Johnson and more.Forget about Jim Grey, this tape is what the All Century Team was all about. If you are or want to give a gift to a baseball fan, this is it. Costas narrates. It is the sport that can lay claim to the century"
2,What does he see in her that I missed?,"Back Cover description: She can save her marriage-by getting pregnant! A year has passed since Leona left her husband, Sheikh Hassan ben Khalifa Al-Qadim. She misses him very much, but what was the point of staying when she'd failed to deliver the one thing Hassan needed-a child and heir? When Hassan tricks her into returning to him, Leona is furious and puzzled. Why does he want her by his side again and back in his bed?I read these out of order, so I knew what happened, but I still couldn't stand Leona's constant harping on not being pregnant. She keeps saying she loves the guy, but she wasn't helpful at all. Not a story I would read again or keep. Read ARABIAN LOVE-CHILD. It's better."
1,Not one of her best!,"Michelle Reid is a fantastic romance writer, but this is far from her best. I could not even finish this book! The plot was incredibly boring and predictable. Hopefully, her next piece will be on the level of one of her previous: The Price of a Bride."
5,I can't get ENOUGH...,"I have been an Alabama fan ever since I saw them at Knotts Berry Farm many years ago. I told the non-believers that this group would be the greatest band, ever.Well, this DVD is the best performance by Alabama. It not only demonstrates incredible talent, it gives lyrics, behind the scene shots, and much more. In reflection, this DVD symbolizes the candle that sits in my window, still burning into the night. It validates what I have been telling everyone all along.The 'boys in the band' are now legends and they have made a tremendous impact upon millions of lives around the world. Anyone that has ever had their doubts about country music, it ain't about that. There is much more to Alabama than country music. Give it a shot. ROLL ON!"
5,Exceptional Compilation DVD!,"This DVD illustrates why Alabama has been referred to as a 'Supergroup"" for the past few years. From the first to the last, Alabama's 41 #1 hits take us through the evolution of the band's various styles, each one built on the last but unique in its own right. This is a band for all seasons, and for all musical tastes - there is something here for everyone. There's no better time to own it now that Alabama has launched its American Farewell Tour. To date, Alabama's music is unparalleled."
3,music,not impressed by this group and wonder why they received so many rewards through all the years they were active
4,microflex review,"The product pictured is what I wanted but instead I got an improved model of the product. Other than that, the shaver came in on time."
5,Wonderful electric shaver,Does a great job. Battery life lasts for weeks. The only thing that could be improved is the on/off switch. It's a little too smooth and hard to slide. I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.
3,Plug not like every other,"The cable for this is not like my R400 or (other shavers), so I have to make sure I bring its own cable when I travel (I used to keep a ""typical"" cable in my travel bag and just throw a razor in when I traveled). In addition it is a wal-wart type, so you have to unplug something else to plug in this thing. It is a real PiNTA ! Could understand if there was an advantage such as fitting in a bigger battery or a better motor, but I don't see either any better than my R400."
5,Beautifull and exceptionally original,"Like almost every single note of Lucassen, this is a space opera that could be classified as exceptionally original. The keyboards are Arjen-signed. I can tell when a keyboard theme is written by Lucassen from the first note of it.8 brilliant voices help this amazing album as well as a bunch of musicians who play guitar and keys.From Vangelis keys to heavy prog guitar themes this album guarantees to never bore you. The story is fantastic.ahh.... Too much speaking for nothing: just buy this thing. It's one of a kind (like every other Ayreon album)"
3,An Adventure,"Take a mixture of hard rock, pop, metal, folk, blues, prog, add several guest vocalists and musicians, blend well, and you have this double disc jammed with over 100 minutes of music. The concept is interesting and would be a very cool musical. The music, vocals and performances on the first disc are solid and exhilarating but on disc two, it loses power. Originally released in 1998, this 2004 re-issue includes a CD-ROM section on the making of the album."
5,Totally carried away,"Very sorry I didn't discover this group, or rather, this project before! I'm now trying to catch up. Arjen Lucassen must be one of the most talented composers of contemporary time. And also a brilliant multi-instrumentalist. And they make concept albums, a thing I used to like in the 70's."
3,"Great music, cheesy narration","While not the best of his career, the music this, Lucassen's third 'Ayreon' album is still top notch. And the storyline is fun, if negligible. However, the narration has got to go. One reading of the liner notes will tell you all you need to know about the story. After that, the narration is simply annoying. But, if you can get past that, an excellent collection!"
5,I Love Jumble BrainBusters,I am a huge fan of Jumble BrainBusters. In fact I love every puzzle David Hoyt makes. He entertains me each day with Jumble Crosswords in the Boston Globe and I highly recommend his puzzle books. Especially the Jumble BrainBusters. I own all the Jumble BrainBusters books.
4,Sha na na,"This CD is fun fun fun!!! I saw Sha-na-na in person many years ago, and I was surprised how tight and good the band was. This CD will bring back many good memories to those who remember and loved Bowser's big mouth, and Johnny's great vibratto.This is really hard to find, as the group's tv show is still not out on video.Joan"
3,A bit snug,We've bought and used other Canon Soft Lens cases and they're good. This one is a little snug WITHOUT a lens hood. So be aware there isn't as much room to spare with this one as Canon allows with some of their others.
1,This thing sucks - don't buy it.,"I bought one of these units; big mistake. I couldn't get the file transfer to work on three different computers. Spent one hour trying to accomplish file transfers. This is a waste of my time, and it will waste yours too. Taking it back today. Beware."
5,Better than I expected,no hankey pankey here. better than expected! thought i was getting a slightly used mildly scuffed tail light and it turrned out to look almost new!
4,Good Single,"This single is good. The songs are good too. I like other songs more by Nirvana. I bought it before I got the box set and I intended to get rid of it after I got the set but I am keeping it. Only for one reason, it has different liner notes. It has the lyrics, yes, but it also has a scan of when Frances (Kurt's daughter) was in Courtney's stomach. It makes this single a one of a kind. But, yes, the songs are good. Curmudgeon is the main highlight of the CD... it's ONLY available on this disc. Go buy it. But, the box set is highly recommended. This is the reason I give the ""Lithium"" single 4 stars. Enjoy."
3,"Lithium is the greatest song ever, but buy Nevermind instead","Lithium, the featured song on this single, is my personal favorite song ever. It has a great guitar lick, perfect pitch change, hard and soft parts, and unmatched lyrics. Been a Son is sort of a punk, fast, fun song that isn't as deep as Lithium and doesn't sound as good, but is still worth a listen for sure. Crumedgon is not very colorful, has some lyrics that are ok but not great, sounds pretty terrible to be honest. Really, this single isn't worth it, you should go out and buy Nevermind (which includes Come as You are, Smells like Teen Spirit, Nirvana's biggest hit, and of course, Lithium), which, surprisingly, is only a couple of bucks more than this. Every track on Nevermind is pure revolutionary grunge from the pioneers of that genre. So buy that, not this."
5,Curmudgeon!,"""Curmudgeon"" is one of my favourite Nirvana songs - It's really cool! It was recorded by Dave Grohl's friend, Barrett Jones, who also recorded the first Foo Fighters album. The UK digipak version of this single also includes ""D7"", a brilliant Wipers cover. ""Been A Son (Live)"" is very similar to the radio session version on Incesticide, so not too interesting, but ""Curmudgeon"" rules, totally!"
1,Know How to Glue Marble?,"Should have heeded other buyers' reviews, because they were fair warning: The packaging was miserable, and the package arrived with the marble top broken. I'm not going to waste my time making a complaint or trying to return it -- it's just a cheap little table for a corner of my living room. But if you buy this table, EXPECT it to arrive broken; if it arrives intact, be grateful."
1,poor packaging and missing hardware,"We got this as an inexpensive table to put a phone on in our conference room. When it arrive it had clearly been returned and re-packaged before; the packing job was a mess. All the items were loose and banging around. In addition, the table came without any hardware, so I returned it. Probably better to spend a few more dollars and avoid this cheap solution."
3,Gets the job done,"I bought this book to help me study for the ARRT Bone Densitometry test. This was my sole source of information. The book itself is not very well orginized and is overly technical when it doesn't need to be. Rather boring, but hey, it is rather boring material anyway. I passed the test, so I suppose it was woth getting. All in all, not a great book, but it gets the job done."
2,Bone Density for Technologist,"I bought the book to study for the ARRT bone density test. Only book I could find. Hard to understand and very technical. Took the post test in the back of the book and had hoped to get an answer key, so I could use it as a study guide. Only received a certificate showing I passed the test. Was told they couldn't give me the answers. Hopefully I can find more study material elsewhere."
4,currently working my way through...,"Good content...although the credits expired in 2005. Very technical so hope it helps me pass my registry! The material is a little dry, so it is taking me some time to get through it."
1,taylor scale,"I Bought This Scale To Weigh Produce That I Sell At The Market. The Dial Hangs Up. Once You Set It At O , It Will Not Go Back After Weighing Something.You Can Tap On The Top Of The Scale A Few Times And It Will Finaly Go Back To O.The Dial Does Not Work Right.Seems To Hang Up.I made Arrangements To Return It ,But It Cost Almost $8.00 To Ger It Here And Another $8.00 To Send It Back.So It's Sitting On The Shelf In The Garage,While I Use My Old One. I Want To Know More About The Amazon Card That You Get $30.00 Credit Toward My Purchace Of A Digital Scale.Please E-Mail Me How This Works. I Am Interested In a Digital Scale For More Accuracy. Thanks. Update: IContacted Amazon About My Problem And They Gave A Complete Refund Plus My Shipping Cost ( Nice People To Do Business With) I Have Since Ordered A Digital Scale From Them.Good People To Do BusinessWith. They Bent Over Backwards To Occomidate Me."
1,Not worth the $$,"This scale did not work correctly upon receipt. I was trying to weigh 3/4 lbs and kept noticing that the portions were getting larger. I reset the scale to 0 and started weighing again--some portions were 1 1/2lbs. I then noticed that each time I weighed, the scale would not go back to 0--that is why I kept getting off in pounds."
3,Not so accurate scale,"I bought this scale to replace an old one. I wanted a certain size and shape to fit into particular spot in my kitchen cabinet and this was the only scale which fit the bill. I like the tray--it provides a surface to weigh food on without falling off. However, every time I touch the scale, I have to readjust the setting because the pointer moves to another spot. I find this a bit frustrating. The dial is very sensitive and I have to play around with it to get back to exactly zero. The ounces go in increments of 2 oz. rather than one. I prefer increments of 1 oz. for more accuracy like my old one. It is economically priced so if you're not too fussy about accuracy, it will suit the purpose. I would, however, recommend a digital scale if you can store it easily. Most of them were too wide or big for my needs."
1,Utter garbage!,"This book really is awful in every respect. The author presents an extremist view of inter-relationship between the church and state. As with most of Kim's literature, anti-Semitic views and ideas are put forward. The title (""Christian Body Politic: 21st Century Reformed Christian Perspectives on Church and State"") of the book is a complete joke considering that most of the content gives an ante diluvium perspective on this relationship.This book is very poorly written and I would certainly advise against reading it as most readers are bound to find its content rather extreme and archaic."
1,Christian 'Dim' strikes again!,"'Christian Body Politic' is a prime example of one of Christian Dim's Jew bashing books. The book consists of a series of anti-Semitic rants. Kim covers issues such as the Zionist conspiracy to dominate the world and how Jews are the cause of all the major disasters on earth e.g. 9/11, Indian ocean tsunami (apparently a Jew dropped a hydrogen bomb in the Andaman-Sumatran trench, causing a massive tsunami), the massacre of the Armenians in Turkey during World War One and even the holocaust (a good thing according to Christian 'Dim'). I'm no Jew but I must say that Christian Dim's obsession with Jews is a little disturbing to say the least. It seems as though Kim is incapable of writing a book without mentioning the Jews. Kim should forget about Jews and concentrate on trying to get a job since he's been on the dole for 20 years. This book is a complete waste of time and should be avoided at all costs."
3,wine preserver,I have seen these things used and they make a big difference in keeping an opened bottle of wine from changing flavor but I cannot get them to work.
4,A must have for yourself or as a gift,This is a great product for wine drinkers--especially if you don't drink the whole bottle at one sitting. My only complaint is that the little 'button' on one of the stoppers came out so just be careful to not spring it loose! Makes a great gift with a bottle of wine and a wine bag/carrier!
1,Useless - don't waste your money,"Useless. The stopper design is terrible. Sort of works OK on some bottles, not at all on other bottles. Even when it does, only hold vacuum for a day or so. Get the Vacu Vin which does work and a has good stopper design that holds vacuum for days and clicks when you have reached vacuum."
2,Valve does not work,"I have had this vacuum system wine preserver by Houdini for over an year now. Unfortunately, after one use the valve stopped working properly. This has happened with both lids. When i use the pump, it does create the vacuum effect, but the valve releases slowly and after hours the vacuum is gone. So, it use it as a regular lid, but it does not serve its purpose."
2,Worked okay. Broke quickly.,"This product worked fairly well. About 80% of the time the bottles held their vacuum. The other 20%, well... the tops made a good cork. Unfortunately, after only about 20 uses, the pump broke while I was using it. The pressure from the vacuum pulled the plunger away from the handle. Since this piece in internal, there's no way to fix it, so it's basically trash now.So... 4 points for how well it worked, but minus two for breaking."
1,"Works well for a while, then breaks","We received the Rabbit version of this as a gift and it worked quite well for a few months. Then there was a great deal of resistance when pulling the plunger and no vacuum seal on the bottle. I found that the rubber 'o-ring' that maintains the vacuum in the pump had partially come off the plunger.The pump is now junk, as there is no way to fix this problem."
1,This is garbage,"So, you have a date with the wife. While she's looking good, your becoming infuriated and looking stupid while pulling this pump that ultimately doesn't do a thing.If you're lucky enough to get a vacuum,(the only way to tell is to release the vacuum and listen for the sound)half the time you pump and pump and get no vacuum at all. If you bump the top even slightly while putting the bottle back in the fridge, you lose the vacuum and have to start all over again. I say save the money and drink the entire bottle, you'll both be happy you did."
5,Great little tool,Really works well. Have had one for over a year and just bought another for a friend.
2,Broken on arrival,The product didn't work and wouldn't form a vacuum when I received it. Amazon promptly refunded my money.
1,Stinky seal,"If it can't hold its vacuum seal till the next day what's the point? They should clearly say ""Not recommended for 1.5 liter bottles"" if that's the problem."
1,Bad product,"This is a poor product. It never manages to really get the air out of a bottle of wine (which you can tell because there is no real ""pop"" when you remove the stopper) -- and after a few months, mine broke. Find another brand!"
3,It does the job...,"But you really should just finish the bottle instead of using this... It does what its supposed to, allowing you to vacuuming out the air to keep the wine as fresh as possible, but I wouldn't preserve my wine for more than a week using this."
5,PRESERVATION and MONEY SAVER,"I bought the Metrokane Houdini Wine Preserver which is a small pump that uses stoppers. The set has two though I recommend to buy more. It's amazing how nice it is to open wine, NOT feel like 'that one' and then NOT HAVE to drink it because today's inexpensive wines turn ugly too quickly.Just place a stopper in the bottle, pump a few times and the wine's good for (so far) up to 9 days. It's like we've never opened the bottle.I have now bought five sets...two for us, and three as gifts (along with the Preserver Pump)...worth every single penny!I would say forget the wine bag next time you bring wine, and bring a set of these. They are a fabulous gift."
2,It's okay,"One stopper was broken the other one worked, but when I opened my bottle of wine it was flat :/I dont recommend this product"
1,KNOCK OFF VERSION! BUY THE GREY ONE!,My boyfriend has the REAL grey one which works VERY well (only $12 vs this crappy $9 one). The REAL grey one will not let you pump anymore once the air is out. Then no leaks.This black KNOCK OFF VERSION after a few pumps one would never suck the air out. Then i laid my bottle of wine on the side... and the bottle was leaking through the top!
4,Houdini vacuum pump,The pump functioned perfectly and I use it whenever I don't finish a bottle of wine. The vacuum seems to hold for a long time.
1,Vacuum seal...not,"I picked up this set at a local department store. Tried it on a bottle of Italian wine I drink nearly 50% of the time. Initially it does pump the air out, which can be verified by pulling on the tab with a resulting hiss. However, in subsequent testing the seal wouldn't stay airtight for even 1 hour.The stoppers feel rather soft/flimsy and do not allow for variance in bottle sizes (which according to other reviews are pretty common). And no, I'm not talking about 1.5l vs. 750ml bottles- just the difference in neck/lip diameter.So perhaps they work ok for a specific bottle size, but YMMV. To me, they're uselessI imagine ""tapered"" stopper designs (or those that go over the top) would work better for different bottle sizes- going to give it a try."
1,This product does not work.,"Do not buy this product, I have used other wine pumps, I have tried this one on several bottles, it must be a lemon, because it draws no air, provides no vacuum, it does not work."
2,"Holds for a couple of days, no more","Just like many have mentioned, it will hold a vacuum for a short time, but if you do not pump it on a daily basis, even when just sitting idle, the suction will NOT hold."
2,Lasted a month,"Other reviews regarding the pump breaking were correct. After about 10 bottles of wine, there was a noticable difference in the suction power and upon inspection there was a broken rubber seal inside the pump that was largely inaccessible. It was cheap, I took a chance, I got what I paid for."
1,No warranty,"My Houdini wine preserver did not work right out of the box. There is no warranty information with the product. After an extensive computer search I found the ""lifetime warranty."" ""Just return your Houdini wine preserver with $10.00 to cover shipping and handling."" I certainly won't be doing that!"
2,Doesn't Work,The houdini wine saver doesn't work well. It's hard to get the pump centered over the stopper and then released without busting the seal you just created. Super frustrating! BUY A VACCU VIN it works 12 million times better and Amazon has them for an excellent price.
1,Doesn't keep a seal,"This wine preserver doesn't keep a seal for very long. If you seal the bottle, and then remove the stopper right away, you will hear the satisfying vacuum sound, indicating that the bottle has been sealed correctly. But if you seal the bottle and wait a day before opening it, then you will see that there is no seal remaining by that point.Save your money and go for a Vacu Vin instead."
1,"try another item, not this one","This seems like such a great idea, however the Houdini Wine saver that I bought has faulty stoppers, they do not hold the vacuum, and so do not preserve the wine. Try another wine saver product."
1,disappointed,I purchased the same product a couple years ago and it has worked great. One of the supplied corks developed a bit of a tear/vacuum leak in it so decided to replace it. The new product came in black which seemed ok however it would not hold a vacuum for even an hour like the original had and was nowhere near as well built. The first one would hold a vacuum for many days. The company must have found a cheaper offshore group to produce it but I would not purchase another one from them as it is in a word (JUNK) . Of course Amazon refunded it no questions asked. I am quite sure they get most of them back.
3,Worked after some help,"Out of the box I was a bit disappointed by cheap construction. When I tried to pump a bottle I was disappointed to see that it didn't appear to be working. Maybe it's just my copy, but the pump part leaked air while pumping. I found that a damp dish rag or a plastic grocery bag to choke the pump and make a tighter seal helped. For the cheap bottles of everyday table wine that I use this for it gets the job done, but for more expensive bottles you will definitely want to go for something better."
1,Doesn't hold vacuum,The stoppers do not hold the vacuum longer than a few minutes and are therefore worthless. I have used other brands of vacuum stoppers which worked fine. I either got a dud batch or the design or quality are flawed--either way it was a worthless product.
3,Wine Freshness Preserver ??????,"Court is ""still out"" on this product. Not fully convinced that this product does what it claims to do yet. Having problems to stay in bottle and really sealing the wine from the air."
1,Not a good seal,"I bought this and the stainless steel one from another company. Although this one seemed to seal better initially, within an hour, it had lost the seal (no air escaped when released). The stainless steel one works well."
3,The product is ok,I have used two or three times and the product works. It kept the pressure under the bottle and maintained the wine in good quality. The only bad comment I have is that I expected a strengthen set. It looks fragile the pressure holder and I do not know if it is going to last.
5,excellent product,"Easy to use and it works beautifully...I corked two wine bottles and they stayed fresh for weeks, a lot longer than the product info even indicated. I'm very happy with this product and am considering giving it as gifts."
5,Easy to maintain the edge and very effective,"I have owned several of these knives.In each case, after thinking I had initially lost the knife, I ordered a new one only to find the original one shortly thereafter. The new knives have then been kept as backup, but were eventually given to friends as well-received gifts shortly thereafter.The edge is easily maintained with my diamond-coated stone sharpener to near razor-like sharpness. I have used this knife on several deer and it always requires minimal sharpening afterwards to bring it back to its original edge.The rubber-coated handle is slip-resistant and I have found that after practice I can simply ""flick"" the knife with my wrist to open it.I currently have two of these - one for use and one for backup should the first one become lost - we'll see who the next lucky friend of mine will receive the backup knife as a gift. :)"
4,Best knife ever made...in China.,"I've owned a few gerbers and the gator is the best knife available. The grippy rubber on the handle never slips, even when you get wet (it's intended for gutting animals...). Well weighted, and the lifetime warranty is unbeatable. Too bad they don't make them in the USA anymore; I'd go 5 stars if they did. Meh, still a great knife."
3,One Liner,"Ya know, I love this man's sense of humor and feel he can write a one-line joke that will curl your toenails; but reading his essays, I have to say that I got bored waiting around for the one-liner to appear..."
4,Great souvenir,"Anyone who has visited this beautiful area of China will enjoy this collection of color photos. The text, in English and Chinese, is brief, but the outstanding photos tell all. This small book is a wonderful reminder of memorable scenery."
5,Perfect picture souvenir,"This book, small in size, is packed with superb photography of one of the most beautiful regions in the world. The limited text provides information as to where each photo was taken (both in English and Chinese). Printing quality is excellent."
4,Good movie,"Saw this movie many years ago, and checked for it to be on TV for several years, to no avail. So happy to find this version. Henry Winkler did a wonderful job."
3,twist on an old classic,"Typical made for TV movie, Can't say that Henry Winkler was one of the best Scrooges we have seen, but enjoyed it. We are collecting all versions of this film that we can find."
5,An American Christmas Carol,Henry Winkler played a great part as Scrooge. It gave yet another twist to all the Christmas Carols of the past.
4,Over looked version of the classic tale,"This is a version of A Christmas Carol, that most haven't seen. It is done well and Henry Winkler plays a perfect scrooge. I love it!"
4,Brilliant Adaptation,"A brilliant adaptation of Dickson's classic set in early 20th century New England. Well written and well acted, Henry Winkler shines as a young entrepreneur who is more interested in wealth and progress than romance and family, until... I don't want to give it away. Trust me. You'll love it."
4,An American Christmas Carol,"Fun DVD and I always like the Christmas Carol, this is not quite up as high as others but I still watch it every year."
3,Christmas Carol by Henry Winkler,Should be included in your holiday movies collection. Funny though to be reminded how much TV you watched BEFORE a commercial break back in the early 80's (as it was a made for TV movie). Henry Winkler does a great job playing an American/Depression era version of Mr Scrooge. Corny (but what Christmas Carol version isn't?) but fun.
3,Pretty good interpretation.,"Henry Winkler was good and this was a pretty good adaptation of Dickens's story. Supporting cast could have been better, but not bad if you've seen all of the regular versions of A Christmas Carol."
5,One of the best Christmas movies ever,"This is one of the best Dickens based Christmas movies of all time. Henry Winkler portrays a very believable rendition as Benedict Slade, the American ""Scrooge"". I make it a yearly ""must see"" every Christmas season. There is one scene that, no matter how many times I view it, brings tears to my eyes. If you like ""feel good"" Christmas movies, don't miss this one!!"
5,A MUST-HAVE FOR ANY VIDEO CHRISTMAS COLLECTION!!,"This is the American adaptation of the Charles Dickens' classic. It is interesting that in the movie the main character is seen ripping the pages out of a collector's item book of ""A Christmas Carol.""Henry Winkler gives an outstanding performance as Benedict Slade, a loan officer who reclaims valued possessions of those unable to make late payments on Christmas Eve.His visit by the spirits, the life in the orphanage and how one man helped him, leads to a very sentimental ending.It would have been good if the images could be enhanced for better viewing. This originally was a 'made-for-TV' program and is presented complete with the fade-outs for the commercial breaks.David Wayne gives a great performance as the book owner as well as Christmases past."
4,Wonderful Variation of an Old Classic,"This movie was made in 1979, when Henry Winkler was in his heyday of playing ""The Fonz"" on ""Happy Days"". It was exciting back then to see what else he could do, and he came through admirably.This movie hasn't played on TV in at least a decade that I remember, and it should be, for it's a fresh take on the old Dickens tale.The setting is Concord, NH in 1933, and miserly Benedict Slade goes about repossessing people's furniture, stoves, radios - and even a piano from a children's orphanage! - on Christmas Eve.Then come the visitations and, well, we know the rest of the story.Pick it up for a treat for next Christmas."
2,Even very good acting by Henry Winkler can't save this flop.,"The premise of swapping the settings of a Christmas Carol to the Great Depression era was an interesting concept. The main problem is the storyline and script. Winkler is cast as a seller of furniture items, radios, etc who re-possesses these items from people on Christmas Eve. It's really hard to get upset over people losing non-essential consumer items. At one point Slade(scrooge) fires his Bob Crachett assistant and does a pretty good job of explaining why it was justified.(So much so it had me on Slade's side.) The visitations by the spirits were simply not very compelling. I found myself sympathizing with the young Slade as he tried to convince his boss to improve productivity and to tighten business practices, to no avail. This movie is alright if you want to pass an hour and a half with something Christmas themed on in the background, but it's hardly Miracle on 32nd Street."
5,An American Christmas Carol,"My daughter saw this movie when she was young and we have waited years for it to become available. We purchased this as a christmas gift for her, She just loves it. Thank you"
5,Christmas Scrooge,"Henry Winkler does an amazing job as scrooge in this tale, he is an awesome actor, I really like sitting down to watch this movie on a cold night."
5,Love this movie!!!,I enjoy watching Henry Winkler other then as the Fonz. He is at his best in this movie. I recommend this movie.
3,American Christmas Carol. Henry Winkler,"Henry Winkler just did not seem like Scrooge. It felt more like an actor playing Scrooge. In other words, I could not enjoy it as well as some of the other actors as Scrooge. Alistair Sim or Patrick Stewart were much better as Scrooge."
4,American CC DVD,This arrived in good time. It was in good condition. I haven't had a chance to watch it yet. I am happy with this purchase so far.
5,An American Christmas Carol,"An American Christmas Carol is one of my favorite all time Christmas movies. Henry Winkler is surperb in his performance as a depression era scrooge.I encourage people to watch, they will not be disappointed. Patrick Wallace"
4,Great twist on the classic.,"As we were picking Christmas movies this year, I remembered seeing one with Henry Winkler. Took me a while to find it because I didn't recall the title correctly. Told my wife she would really like it. Was not disappointed. A very good Christmas classic in my book. Winkler is terrific in this role."
4,An American Christmas Carol,"It is on the same basis as other Christmas Carol movies, just played a little differently and with Henry Winkler as the scrooge. We enjoyed it. Now we have it and can bring it out each Christmas. Aside from the review I wanted to say I had ordered the item late and figured I would not get it until after Christmas, but it was shipped out standard and I received it in a very few days."
3,twist,This is the classic story with a fresh look. I like it. I owned this on VHS and was pleasantly surprised to find it on disc.
4,The Fonz does Scrooge,I first saw this movie as a kid in the late 70's. I never forgot and when i found it on dvd i could not resist. It brought just as much enjoyment now as then. I like the twist on a classic with an American version.
4,Watch every Christmas,"Reproduction is first rate. Limited extras but interesting. I think the original production was on par with other TV movies of the time. The adaption of A Christmas Carol to a Depression era setting was well done. Henry Winkler is excellent in portraying the bitter old man. If you have a Christmas DVD collection, like me, this belongs in it."
4,An American Christmas Carol,Since I was a child many years past I have been interested in Dickens Christmas Carol. When I saw this version it stood out amoung the many other versions out there. Henry Winkler plays a good scrooge charactor. The story itself is based on Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol and the story sticks very close to the original with a 1920s depiction of the American depression.
3,Christmas,My wife told me of this movie in which Henry Winkler stars & shows he can act in this different version of a Chrismas Carol.
5,Une oeuvre à posséder!!!,"Bonjour!Je crois que de toutes les versions qui ont été faites du conte de Charles Dickens, celle-ci est sans doute à la fois la plus originale et la plus fidèle. Le thème central est bien respecté mais l'adaptation est totale puisqu'elle situe l'action en Amérique plutt que dans l'Angleterre du 19e siècle mais avec une touche début du siècle et moderne.Mme si ce film n'est disponible qu'en anglais sur DVD, il vaut la peine d'tre acheté puisqu'il n'est plus diffusé à la télévision depuis plusieurs années suite à une mésentente avec le producteur et il semble bien que la situation n'est pas près de changer. C'est un film de collection que tous se doivent de posséder pour le temps de Nol. Une version franaise a jadis été disponible mais elle ne l'est plus maintenant ce qui est très malheureux. Henry Winkler est remarquable."
3,A foible adaptation but not without merit,"Mr. Winkler failed to capture my attention in this ignoble version of the classic Dickens fable. However, it isn't without a certain charm all its own. And to Henry's credit, and partly to my own blame, I have never been able to seperate Henry Winkler from the Fonz of Happy Days. I can't say that I disliked the movie it just doesn't rate up there with the Christmas classics in my estimation and this is simply my own personal take on the film.If you're looking for a Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy together on occasion then this DVD will fit right in, but if you're looking to gather movies for your library that are the so called ""must have Christmas movies"" then pass it up for another title."
4,good software,"good software, great simple language tuition, I am generally very satisfied, the practice sessions are goodwhat is bad:the DVD is good but be aware that it has to be in your drive to work so if, like me, you travel without one you are stuffedthe podcasts are great but should have been included in the audio CDother than that, highly recomended"
1,"Good but too short, overpriced","The content is too short for its price.It consists of 45 chapters, but they are quite short.At chapter 45, you are left with still too few tools to maintain a conversation.This just helps you to not get lost, order at a restaurant, buy a ticket and situational chit chat.A good starter, but not for the serious learner.Way overpriced!!!After buying a series of 5 text books to learn mandarin, i feel i wasted money on that dvd.The dvd content is covered within the first half of the first textbook."
5,"Excellent, full of new ideas and very helpful","I'm using FLUENZ Mandarin 1+2 daily now and I'm totally satisfied.It's a wonderful software for language-learning and in my opinion, the approach to this sometimes very frustrating procedure is excellent, full of new ideas and very helpful. The FLUENZ team did a very good job."
5,Fluenz Mandarin1+2 is hen hao! (very good!),"Fluenz Mandarin 1+2 Windows 1.1, Next-Generation Chinese Language Learning SoftwareThis format is varied and quite easy to use. You learn to speak and write Mandarin using the romanized alphabet. A pretty quick way of learning the language. It will be invaluable on my trip to China soon."
3,Dave Miller gets it right with the mix of nature and music.,"The ONLY reason this is getting a 3 star rating is becuse Dave Millers The Best of Meditation Music/Nature is my absolute favorite nature/music CD ever,ever,ever. Many of the songs on Oceam Paradises are on the Best of Meditation CD. He includes the most real sounding nature spots I have ever heard, the ocean, birds, waves, thunder , lightening, mountain nature sound, ( these are on the ""Best of"" CD) The music fits the nature sounds perfectly and of course the sounds are not mixed on the same song, meaning when the song is playing ocean sounds , ocean sounds are all you get like crashing waves, sea gulls, whales etc. you just have to listen the the samples , to decide for yourself, I listen to them both every day, I am a huge reader, and have lots of unwanted disruptive loud noise in my life, I pop on my headphones and either just enjoy my miny vacation in nature, or soothe the nerves while reading."
4,Very good and practical.,"Torbert explains his method vivid and clear. For people who work with professionals in training & coaching settings and looking for an integral approach, this is good material."
3,just ok,I listened to most of this album and some of the songs i enjoyed though i thought they kinda ripped off of other bands riffs to make the album
4,cole porter tribute,"This is a great dvd what makes it great you say? Well first you have Ethel Merman being Ethel Meman. Cole Porter tunes anything better I think not! You have the fabulous voices of John Rait, Martha Wright(a singer extraordinaire that is largely forgotten,Gretchen Wyler Who played Peggy In Porter's Silk Stockings. The print is quite good for it's age. As a bonus you see seveal incomplete versions of Miss Meman on another Bell Telephone special(wich afterviewing did cause me to have nightmares. I hope that there will be more of these great programs isued latter"
4,Wonderful Duet from Two Legends!,"Loved seeing Merman at the top of her game. And to see Gretchen Wyler after discovering her in the film ""Broadway: The Golden Age"" was wonderful.The bonus features are fun, too. There is a completely different full show of Merman on there. Although she doesn't say much, it is intereting to see when they have retakes.Keep these great shows coming!"
4,Art for Travellers ; Italy,"It is a very good guide for the amateur, even more remarkable considering that it was written by Australians.I am an Italain national myself living in Hawaii for the time being and I know that I will put this guide to good use when I eventually decide to rediscover my own country.Highly recommended."
2,Not a true phonics reader,"These books contain difficult blends and sight words from the earliest book. Making it very difficult for children who are truly just learning each sound. By the time a child is able to read some of the difficult content in these books, they probably no longer need to worry or think about what a short a and a long a is, because they are more fluent readers.A waste of money for what I wanted it for."
1,Thumbs down from parents of a beginning reader,We have a 5 yr old who is in kindergarten. I bought this Spongebob set because it said phonics reader. I am disappointed-- this is not for a beginning reader. Too many difficult words- doesn't really follow a true phonics reader format I don't think. It will probably be another year or two before he can really read this book.
2,phonics? where?,"I purchased these for my 4 year old-- she loves Spongebob and being read to, and I thought these would be a helpful introduction to reading. Each book in the package focuses on a sound (long e, short e, etc.). However, there is no bolding or highlighting in the book to really focus the attention on the sounds, and I didn't really find them very helpful in a phonics way. She enjoys the simple stories because they're Spongebob, but I wouldn't purchase them for the phonics."
4,Great set of books.,"Came is great condition. My 5 year old loves Spongebob so the books are a great help to me to get him interested in reading and learning his letter sounds. My 8 year old is also interested in reading them, they do have bigger words, it helps with his reading comprehension as well."
5,beautiful,this cd is amazing with its red stained harmonies and vampyric rhythm. all of the songs are fantastic. jonathan davis is a genuis.
2,Interesting...but repetitive,"Ok...personally...I despised this movie. Completely. The Vampire Lestat was awkwardly blended in...I can't say enough. However, I'll save that for another review.Granted, this CD does have some interesting parts...It has a feel for the book but it doesn't seem to match up...it's a bit too sound effects-y to me.If you're looking for something along the 'haunting' lines get the soundtrack for Interview With The Vampire."
5,Dark and Evil,"I love this cd. I bought it off of ebay and i am glad i did. My favorite tracks are On the Beach, Jesse's Dream, and Air Lestat. They are haunting. It takes you away to a different time. It is so evil and so melancholy. I am absoulelty mesmerized by this cd. Air Lestat makes me feel as if though i am flying in own vampires arms."
4,A couple of tracks missing,"Love the movie, and the soundracks, excellnt.Sadly, there are some tracks, scores etc in the movie not avilable on either CD. Some of these are 'Invitation' by Robin Casinader, 'After' performed by Wide Open Cages, but is available on Youtube, 'Temptation' performed by Sasha Lazard, and available on her 2002 album, and youtube.... but sounding like nothing out fo the movie, and lastly (from my list), 'Stay Down' by Candyhateful...cannot find this anywhere.There's another score I'm also looking for. It's at the beginning of the movie, just after Lestat finishes his press conference, switches off the TV monitor and sits back in his chair...very intene synth music. Anyone?"
4,Soundtrack,I enjoyed this soundtrack. The only thing I question is why is there 2 soundtracks? They have divided the music from the movie into 2 CD's.
5,Nice!,"I was afraid they weren't going to release the score ablum, since the movie did pretty mediocre at the box office, and to my knowledge, the soundtrack wasn't so big a hit either. But this movie, in addition to all the rock tunes (which were fun) had a great score, such as we hear all too rarely in horror films these days. Great stuff!"
5,iSkins was a hit!,I bought the iSkins for my sister as a birthday gift and she switches the iSkins to match her outfits. She totally loves them. :)
1,Buyer beware,I was extremely disappointed with this book. The theory is very inaccurate. The authors don't seem to have a grasp on what working memory is or on mental models. I was looking for a book that applies the practice of graphics in education to sound theory. This is not it.
3,dissapointed,Bought this to replace the original one i bought 2 or 3 years back....thinking it had the same range as the one i bought before ...incidently for the SAME price! Found this was not the case as it has about half the range as before ...about 100 feet ..vs 200 easy feet before....i found that the company renamed the model number i bought previously that had the same range as my old one but TWICE the amount! Buyer beware
5,Just love his voice,"I have always loved the way Kenny Rogers sang, and to watch him was even more fun. Older now but still like him. Was just in the mood when I bought it."
5,Great composite album,"This is a GREAT compilation of Kenny's greatest love songs. Sounds great, no matter what version. Every artist changes their songs from performance to performance. It still sounds great!!"
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed by the fact that some of these songs aren't his original recording of the song. For example ""Through the Years"" is a remake that sounds nothing like the original ""Through the Years"". I may as well throw it in the trash, as I will never listen to it again."
1,Not what I expected.,Very disappointing. Too drawn out and some parts were in french . Probably interesting to history students but not worth buying unless one plans on traveling to Versailles.
5,Did they really see the ghost of Marie Antoinette?,"A thorough and absorbing re-examination of the curious story of two proper English ladies - Miss Moberly and Miss Jordaine - who went for a stroll one hot summer day in 1900 and came back convinced that they had traveled through time and seen Marie Antoinette. This is one of the world's great, unresolved ghost stories, and this slim volume does a very in-depth examination of exactly what these ladies may have seen and exactly how their story has been dealt with down through the decades. Thought provoking and very satisfying for the reader of true life ghost stories. I literally searched for this book for years and finally finding it was well worth my long, long anticipation. Highly recommended."
5,An evocation of Louis XVI's Versailles which nobody knew,"A magical walk in the castle's park, where two English spinsters, schoolmistresses, discovered an incredible view of what Versailles was before the French Revolution. Amazingly authentic and truthful. I loved it and I think everyone who loves France should read it, if you can find it!"
5,After Months of Searching I found this book,"After months of searching I found the book I had been looking for. An Adventure, which is in this book, Ghosts of the Trianon. I am incredibly happy they printed this."
1,Don't but these scissors,"I purchased these scissors because the gingher equivalent has been dropped by gingher, but believe me these are no replacement. I had used them very little and the screw holding them together came out. The are not sharp at all and will not even cut thread. I should say that I normally find Mundial scissors fine and economical, especially the red-dot versions, but, these embroidery scissors are very sub-standard."
2,THE WORST SOUND EVER.,"THE MUSIC IS BEAUTIFUL AND THE SINGERS DO THEIR JOB. ZAMBON IS ACTUALLY VERY GOOD. LUISA MARAGLIANO MADE ME RUN FOR MY OLVERO RECORDINGS TO WASH HER SCREAMING OFF MY EARS. ONE MUST ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THIS IS THE ONLY AVAILABLE RECORDING OF THIS OPERA, A LIVE TAKE FROM 1974. ALAS, IT HAS THE (IN)FAMOUS GALA SOUND, THAT IS, IT SOUNDS AF IF RECORDED THROUGH A BOX, REALLY INTOLERABLE. ADD TO THAT THE LACK OF NOTES OR LIBRETTO, WHICH I WOULD NOT MIND IF AT LEAST I COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BEING SUNG (I KNOW ITALIAN). SO, AT YOUR OWN RISK."
2,Help pages online - not a guide!,"I agree with the guy who said it's not a guide. Don't buy if you are confused by Quickbooks interface and plan to learn how to use it properly from financial point of view. To get the guide, simply print out the help pages."
2,Problems,"Let's start with the problems. After two cartridges failed in less than 400 pages total, I'm returning the printer. The documentation is terrible. Just try setting a static IP address on the thing! I had to call technical support a few times to get correct and complete instructions. Which brings be to the third problem. Their tech support sucks. Their hours are limited and their people are not too bright. Expect to get about 500 pages out of the original cartridge. At least that's what tech support told me. I got 70. On the plus side, they only gave me a little push back when I asked them to replace the printer. They want to replace the printer but not the photo conductor. But, they finally saw the light."
1,"Poor printer, poor service","I do a lot of work on pre-printed forms (single sheet, normal weight paper). This printer constantly pulled in the paper incorrectly and thereby printed crookedly on the paper. My inkjet worked fine on the forms, but I need the greater permanence of the laser print. I worked with Lexmark customer service and they were kind enough to replace my first 120n, but the replacement was actually worse. I spent nearly three hours with an online service person concerning the second printer only to finally realize they couldn't or wouldn't do anything for me. So I will buy another printer and chalk this up to a lesson learned. The quality of the print and speed of the printer were great, but I have to have an image that is straight on the page."
4,God Sex and Apple Pie,"Was impressed with Jerry's work. You wanted to know more about these characters. Was similar to the ""Big Chill"". Can't be all bad since the film won 6 Film Festival Awards. Good job Jerry!!! Have to give this a good review because I went to school with Jerry (Jerome)... Check it out for yourself!!"
4,food for thought,"This book was a surprise. Not what I expected from reading the exerpt, but very thought provoking. The lesson could be applied today just as it was in that time period. I couldn't put it down."
5,Refreshing!,"This is a great novel. It is often difficult to find good Christian fiction in the Non-Romance arena so I was pleased to stumble across this book for Kindle. It was a story to savor slowly, really listenting to the author's beautiful voice. I look forward to finding more by this author."
4,Good read,"This book kept my interest throughout, I found it a very enjoyable read. Not sure I loved the ending. More depth in the slave characters post Papa perhaps?"
3,1927 Deep South Drama,"I was thoroughly wrapped up in this story from the get-go. The author certainly knows how to turn a phrase and lure you into the story. I was disappointed that certain plot points were obvious to me before it was officially ""revealed"" in the story. That said, even though I figured out much of the ""mystery"" early on, it was still an enjoyable book. It made me want to research the Mississippi Flood of 1927 more, and to look up more info about secret plantations with slaves after the Civil War."
4,This book touched me.,"I read many novels per year. Most are entertaining. Only a few bring me to the point of introspection. Having been reared in south Louisiana and in a racially biased society of the 50's and 60's, this well-written, gut-wrenching story reawakened some of the shame and regret of being a middle-class white in an era of racial discord and change. And the confrontation of the denial that exists in seemingly harmonious racial mingling was eye opening even in the present.The story itself is well-told with enough distance to create mystery but enough detail and tension to keep me riveted and unable to stop reading.I will definitely read more of Mr. Dickson's novels. He tells a great story and does the ultimate in his reader--he makes you feel the emotions of his characters in the deep recesses of your emotions."
4,Good book,"This is the second I have read by Dickson and I really enjoyed this one as much as the first. I couldn't put it down, read it in a day. Will read more by Dickson"
3,river rising,it was a rather dark story. It did bring a small community of blacks and whites together after a tragic event.
4,Received product in timely fashion,"Received product in a timely fashion. The book had an odor to it, not sure if it was smoke, but I am a non-smoker and noticed something. Otherwise everything as expected."
5,Riveting,"I found it hard to put down, very good story line and kept you guessing right up till the end."
3,Rising Interest,"I don't care for the super natural, but this book made me interested enough to finish. I did like it."
2,"Good, But Predictable","The Newsboys release another worship cd(yawn). While ""Adoration"" was an interesting and well done cd, ""Devotion"" continues that trend without adding anything new, exciting, or different. I guess if something works, you stick with it but this cd just kinda left me wishing for more. There are some gems on this cd but nothing can top the simplicity or impact that made ""It is You"" so powerful. Particularly forgettable is their version of ""Blessed Be Your Name"", which is a shame because they really do a great version of this in concert. This is a talented band who really can ""Shine"" when they want to. If you're a new fan, check out ""Thrive"" which I consider to be a true highlight of their remarkable career and fervent ministry."
1,A Worse Newsboys Album,"Why not follow a bad effort with a worse one? Why not abandon all early fans? Why not make an album that's just made for the pathetic radio crowd? That's what they did. ""Presence"" is just as bad as ""Amazing Love"" and song like ""Blessed Be Your Name"" are downright pathetic covers, and some of the worst in the industry.Overall, boycott this sad effort from the Newsboys. It's a truly bad album with no substance."
3,Good Collection of Praise And Worship Songs,"'Devotion' is a solid collection of praise and worship songs. Although I don't think it is as good as their first album of this type, 'Adoration', it is still quite good.There are some very good songs on this CD. Among those are the following: Presence (My Heart's Desire), God of Nations, and Landslide of Love. They do a version of 'Blessed Be Your Name' that is ok. They do it much better live and Tree63 does a fantastic version of it.Although this is not their strongest album, it is still a quality CD that will be enjoyed by Newsboys fans as well as anyone looking for a good praise and worship CD. In spite of that, if you haven't heard 'Adoration' before, I would definitely recommend that one over this CD."
2,Welcome to Hicksville...,"...or that's how the author would have it seem. This book does present the technical facts about the case, but he goes out of his way to paint the town with a negative, ""redneck"" flavor. Sure, there are ""redneck"" folks around, but they're in every town.Honesdale isn't a bad little town. Just a normal, everyday America small town. It's a decent place to live, just not a lot going on. This was one of the biggest stories of the time."
5,Thorough Text for Any Serious Practitioner,"This text is a fantastic work in helping to illuminate the use of debate in the context of Tibetan doctrinal work, specifically in the Proponents of Sutra Following Reasonsing (Sautrantika). While it does serve its purpose in doing so, Dan Perdue has also helped to explain some of the fundamental topics in Tibetan Buddhism, such as established bases and the different forms of reasoning. This book may be a little dense for beginners and those not familiar with Tibetan Buddhist terminology, but it is valuable nonetheless. Apart from the context of debate in Tibetan Buddhism, the books helps one to establish better forms of reasoning in everyday life, as well teaching one to deconstruct those false forms of reasoning one encounters all the time."
5,Very happy with this laptop bag,"After my last laptop bag was stolen, it was time to search for a new one. I checked customer reviews and product details of probably 50 or 60 bags. I ended up with this one and it was everything I was looking for. It's a hair heavier that a similar product without wheels would have been, but, it has wheels...It could easily pass for a ""standard"" laptop bag with the handle telescoped into the bag. It looks professional and it works well. Also, the included laptop sleeve is handy for airports."
5,Great product at great value,"Saw this exact item for ~33% more in office supply stores. I was looking for a rolling laptop case that was not too big to carry on the plane but could hold either my netbook or 15"" laptop. This is perfect! Quality is excellent."
2,Disappointed,"Item was not able to be shipped to Australia, I do not think this was indicated in the original description."
2,Really like the bag but the leather is already peeling off,"I purchased this bag from Amazon in April of this year (i.e., three months ago). I have never traveled with it and simply carry it as a briefcase to work. This consists of being driven in the back seat of my car to my office. Otherwise, it is simply carried from my house to my car and from my parking space to my office. It is more than fair to say this bag has lived a very gentle life.However, the leather is already peeling off, as shown in the user picture I've added here. I realize the bag was reasonably priced, but I would expect it to be presentable for more than three months. So, I'm very disappointed it's falling apart already. It really was a nice bag that I was hoping to travel with but I don't see this Solo bag lasting much longer.I've emailed the company and I'll post an update based on customer service."
5,Love it exactly what I wanted!,"Perfect, exactly what I wanted from the color to the pockets to the room and wheels and strap for stairs!"
3,NOT MUCH SUPPORT,"This thing does suck you in around your midsection but the top portion fits more like a sports bra - but without much support for bigger chests. I would wear this around the house and to bed for something comfortable but not out, unless I wore a bra underneath it. Kind-of disappointing since the name says WHAT A LIFT."
4,Good book for little Boys and Daddys,"My husband reads this book to my son every year for his birthday; he's now 6. When he reads it tears come to my eyes because of the sensitivity of the verses.This is Will Smith's song ""Just the Two of Us"" set to pictures in a story format. You never realize how powerful some rap/R&B; music is until you read it. This proves that."
3,Hmmmm?,"The cover of this book looks great. The idea of the book seems great. But the excerpts from this book seem really lame! I know that it must sound much better performed - after all, the book was originally a song. I want so much to like this book, but I know that anyone else (not already famous) presenting a book with such weak text to a publisher would never have their work for sale in a bookstore.Oh, by the way... what does Jon Muth and Floyd Cooper have to do with this book? They are listed as illustrators, but their contribution is not described."
3,! worked; 1 didnt,"but for the one that worked, it was nice! Clear picture, and everything. the other cable i ordered just kind of didnt work."
3,Good Value,"It seems to work as advertised. I would not know any different. It is the only HDMI cord I have, and I have a good picture."
3,Not what I expected....,"Love Dickens writing, but expected ""beautiful illustrations"" I thought they bordered on juvenile. Hate to give it 3 stars but definitely not what I expected."
5,A fun Christmas book for Foodies,"This book is full of great old-time recipes for Christmas like they used to make during Charles Dickens' era, things like cock-a-leekie soup, scolloped oysters, mincemeat tarts and more. And if you can't find the older ingredients at your local A & P (like beef suet), Alice Ross does a good job of suggesting substitutes. The book is full of lovely illustrations of family life back then and it is fun to see what Dickens was thinking about Christmas long before he wrote A Christmas Carol. I also think this would make a nice gift as it is nicely designed."
1,My advice: do not buy this book,"I purchased this book last year for my wife who uses Office at work on a PC and at home on a Mac. She frequently has trouble figuring out how to do something at home that she does every day at work. Certainly this is due to variations in ""the same"" Microsoft product. However, every time she has turned to ""The Missing Manual"" she can not find the answer to what she feels is a simple problem.Just today she made a comment that we should just burn the book because it simply has never once taught her anything. Yes, it is full of hints and suggestions but to call it a ""manual"" is misleading. We have found it impossible to use as a reference, to look up something and find the answer.I am very disappointed and do not recommend purchasing this book, save your money."
5,Great Book!,"I've looked at most of Office for Mac books, and this one knocks me out. Very clear and thorough. I'm hoping they continue it for 2004."
5,"Ski with your feet (obvious, but we use to forget it)","The book offers a simple method to improve your ski level focussing on your feet. It is inspired in the same methods that are using the best alpine skiing trainers all over the World, but for every body (not only for racers) and every ski level. This really works."
1,Not Worth the Money,"This video was less about pugs and more about some quirky people that own the dogs and show them. I wanted to see the lovable, mischievous, and endearing qualities of this exceptional breed since I am a pug owner myself. This film was so lacking in any ""cute pugs"" or adorable antics, that I watched it once and threw it in the garbage. This video was a ""show"" of breeders at pug shows - absolutely terrible."
1,Factually incorrect book,Don't buy this junk. It's just plain wrong. It covers the years 1900-1999 which is NOT the 20th Century. Pure garbage. Airheaded nonsense. I suggest you keep looking for something which won't rot your brain.
1,"First minute I tried, I decided to return not for macbooks !","The basic function of this cushtop stand is to hold things over it. And it cannot simply do that. I've got 2 macbook pro's 13 and 15 inc. They're sliding even the cushtop is at the desk. It is not suitable for the aluminium macbooks, this belkin is going back."
5,A must for couch surfing!,"I have 2 laptop holders that I use constantly. This one is perfect for sitting on the couch or floor. I love being able to tuck the tv remote and a notebook and pen in the center. I was worried about the fabric staying clean but another review said it was easy to clean so I ordered it, with 3 kids, 4 dogs and many cats I have to say so far (2 months) everything has brushed right off and it still looks brand new. I liked it so much I got the Belkin Laptop Hider!Belkin Laptop Hideaway (Chocolate/Tourmaline)It's very stable and just the right height. My laptop runs warm (sony vaio) but I never ever feel it with this holder."
1,Lap Top still over heats!!,"I am somewhat disappointed in this item, I bought it in hopes of being able to use my computer on my couch without overheating. Although it does take longer for the computer to overheat than it normally does, but it still overheats. I ended up buying another product Rolodex Laptop Stand which works great! Too bad I wasted my money with this Belkin product, I am surprised on the good reviews it had. Now it makes me think the reviews may have been fake."
4,Nice to have ...,"This is a good product to have, if you own a laptop. It beats having a blanket over your legs in the summer."
4,Comfortable and convenient notebook stand,"I got this CushTop Notebook stand for my 2 laptops, one 13-inch and one 15-inch. The dual side use fits perfectly for both of my laptops. The stand prevents you from having a hot laptop on your lap for hours. I also occasionally use my computer on the floor, so this raises it off the ground in a much more comfortable typing position. It also lets the air circulate beneath the computer instead of setting it on the carpet, pillow or bed which can prevent overheating. I like this type of stand better than one with a cooler fan that you need to plug into a USB drive or a power outlet. I'm not someone who likes extra cords hanging from my computer or cluttering my workspace, so this has been a great alternative. I'm really happy with this notebook stand and would recommend it to anyone."
5,Good product !,"The most interest thing is that there is place to put ur mouse, USB, CDs... in. However, it is still a little thick, I think. Should be thinner."
1,I only wish I could give this negative stars it brings me so much fury,"This ""lap desk"" (or whatever you want to call it) is a piece of TRASH. Its bulky, inconvenient, nonadjustable (not that I thought it was adjustable, but its so huge getting it at the right angle for comfort is impossible) and nearly catches your computer on FIRE it does so little to keep it cool. A five year old lacking in creativity could design a better product for a laptop with Popsicle sticks. Literally, incredible example of why American capitalism and consumerism is the perfect recipe for devices that go into landfills. Crap, and oh my is it crap, like this makes me wish humans never evolved beyond early hominid times. I cannot stress enough what a HORRIBLY ill planned ""product"" / piece of garbage this is. I feel so sorry for anyone who lost money on this. I'm so miserably displeased with this product I want to take genuine efforts to prevent it from ever selling a product again in order to spare my fellow humans."
3,Nice but dark in color,"I have the khaki which looks more like a light silver...spilled some coffee on it which would not come out so I ordered the SILVER. When I received it, I was surprised at how dark the color was! It was more like a dark grey than silver. If you don't mind the color, it's a great product! I use it with my netbook when I am in bed or out on my deck sitting on the floor...very sturdy! For me, I did end up ordering the khaki one again but will keep the silver for an extra backup just in case!"
1,PRO' S & CONS,"I hav had some w/fans and some w/out, none are any good after 3 too 6 mos. Best choice is with a little ingenuity thinking. I removed the cover from the laptop, set the eternal pc in a non magnetic bag, took the case, removed the feet put on by the manufacturer and put in all 4 corners adjustable chair glides w/rubber feet, put it back together, front feet screwed all the way in and the rears extended all the way out, giving me 4 inches in the rear, w/plenty air space under my pc on the tray made for it too sit on. IT NEVER GETS HOT ANYMORE.I am 76 yrs old.thx 4 reading"
1,The Product is Great,This product is great. The seller is terrible. Antoline will not work with you on correcting problems.
4,Belkin notebook stand,"Before I purchased this stand, I had one those fans. My computer would always slide off, and it just didn't work. I like this much better, it is comfortable on my lap and seems to keep things cool. The computer still gets a little hot, but my legs don't anymore. I also use it when I have my laptop on my desk and I really like that."
3,Too Big & Bulky,"I ordered 2 of these. You turn the very hard cushion over depending on the size of your laptop. It is just too 'high' for comfortable use of the keyboard. Also, the opening for cord storage is too narrow and it is nearly impossible to get the plug into/through it and there is no way the power 'pak' would fit, so I can't use it. I think I am going to cut it in half, may be more effective. The only plus I see is that my lap does not get hot from the computer, hence 3 stars,although it does not appear to allow the computer to cool, it still gets hot. My husband does not use the one I bought him, again it is to high. it is better than nothing.wouldn't recommend it."
2,Blocks cooling vents,"The firm surface is still too soft for the laptop. Before too long my laptop's ""legs"" sunk into the padding. The bottom was then completely sitting on the fabric and blocked the air vents, no different than using a pillow. They should just make a 15"" model and a 17"" model with one hardened side. Laptop's need a hard surface to sit on, not a firm surface. Bought an xpad and like it very much."
3,"Great, but what do you do with it when you aren't using it?","The product does exactly what it is intended for, so if that is your only concern, buy it now! I however live in an apartment and find that this relatively huge laptop stand takes up a lot of space and is hard to find a convenient place (aka, near the bed) to store it. If you are looking for a condensed solution to over heating laptops, then this is not for you."
5,Belkin Notebook Stand,"I purchased this notebook stand in January 2009 and I am very pleased with it. I can lay in bed and use my laptop without any problems. Before I bought it I would use pillows, but the pillows would get extremely hot after a few minutes. I no longer have this problem. I highly recommend the Belkin Notebook Stand."
5,PERFECT!,"I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop that is prone to overheating. After years of using an old camera box to set it on for good circulation, I started looking for a stand for it. This was and is THE perfect answer. I ordered it, got it in 2 days, started using it yesterday. It keeps my laptop cool so it doesn't shut down from overheating , I'm now able to put my laptop on my lap instead of to the side on the cushion of my couch and it doubles, for me, as a ""desktop"" to do school work. I LOVE IT! I would highly recommend this for anyone who doesn't have a dedicated table to use their laptop on. So far, I haven't found any ""cons"" to this great little laptop stand. It exceeds all of my needs, and it can used for other things as well, such as a ""tv tray"" for dinner on the couch in front of the tv. Great item, great price...well worth the money. The only complaint I have is that I didn't find it a lot sooner!"
5,Notebook Stand,I read several of the reviews before purchasing this stand and was concerned but thought I would try it anyway. It turned out to be a great product. Other reviewers mentioned that their computers still get hot. I have not had that problem. It is the perfect size for my laptop. And I like the little storage pocket for cords and the mouse. My laptop stays in place and does not slide. I use this product daily. It brings my laptop up to a good height so that I am not constanly straining my neck. I cannot find anything negative re this product.
3,One great song in a vast landfill,"Far Corporation was a rock band assembled by German producer Frank Farian, otherwise known as the man behind Boney M. The only real hit of Far Corporation was a cover version of ""Stairway to Heaven"", released in 1985. The album ""Division One"" includes the long (about 10 minutes) version of the song.Unfortunately, all other songs are completely worthless. We're talking landfill material.Personally, I think Far Corporation's version of ""Stairway to Heaven"" is much better than Led Zeppelin's original (!), but that's me. Far Corp sound more respectable, civilized and well, Euro-popish. You might also consider checking out the shorter radio version of their cover song, available elsewhere at Amazon-dot-com.Since most of this album suck, I only give it three stars - all those stars are for ""Stairway to Heaven"", which by itself is worth something like 1,985 stars."
3,Slightly unfair review...,"The review system on Amazon is based on personal like/dislike and that is why I've given Division One only 3 stars. The version I purchased is a Japanese Import (shipped from the USA seller to me in the UK) and contains the nine tracks shown in the listing. The material is very well produced and performed.In truth, I was only looking for *that* song. For years I've been looking for the full version of the Far Corporation's version of Stairway To Heaven and, finally, I have it. I happen to fall in the camp that prefers the FC version to the original Led Zep recording but I can see why others do not like the FC version. In essence, the LZ version is more raw and edgy whereas the FC version is much more ""rounded"" and has a fuller sound. Some would say over produced, although I don't agree.The rest of the album isn't really for me and so I'd suggest it's best to look at other reviews for an overview on the album as a whole."
3,"Sounds like Phil Collins and Jan Hammer were helping on ""Stairway""","Picked it up after several years of not hearing it. I forgot how 80s this all was. People buy this largely for the Stairway to Heaven remake. What I didn't remember was the drum fill that sounds exactly like a similar cresendo within ""In the Air Tonight"" by Phil Collins. You know - that moment that everyone air drums to? Also, the keyboards join in about four minutes into the song. Sounds like Jan Hammer. ""Fire and Water"" sounds like ""Funky Town"". ""Johnny Don't Go the Distance"" is a nice underdog boxing story. All in all, the album is respectable but dated. Hard for me to rate it at 4 but wanted to give it 3.5 stars. Why aren't more out-of-print albums available on iTunes?"
4,Best Version,"I agree with an earlier reviewer, their version of Stairway to Heaven is the best I have heard and it is so catchy.It is great to end a party night off with."
2,"Poor production, good singing","Frank Farian is a total hack. The production on this CD is horrible, and Frank has completely lost the plot with regard to feel. However, the singers sound fine, particularly the remarkable Bobby Kimball. Get it for him."
1,Hello!! Everyone SOS!! Help me to find a solution .......,"I am very happy to find this album at Amazon.com. There sre 2 questions,I would like to ask for you about this album and 2nd release album(Solitude). Could someone help me to understanding .Thanks!! Question: 1 I saw the track listing of both ""Solitude"" and ""Divsion One"" ,which got same track in there as :Stairway to heaven (Division One),One of your lovers (Division One). but them had been remixed and released in 2nd album (Solitude), so what's difference in between 1st and 2nd ? Question:2 In your opinion,which one is best ? give me a suggestion plz!! Anyway! thanks a lot in advance and Merry X'mas for you!"
1,Replacement Parts are Nonexistent,"I didn't know I was buying a Disposable Electric Razor when I bought this, but I contacted Remington about replacement parts and they said: ""it's supposed to be used a couple of times and thrown away."" What A joke!!! I am not impressed with that...Where are all the ""Trendy"" electric razors with replacement parts?"
1,Horrible!,"Please DO NOT waste your money on this! I bought this shaver a while back and it's in the trash now. It doesn't even shave off your hair, it only tears up your skin. I was fooled into buying it by it's sleek look, should have done my research first. Back to my Panasonic for me!"
1,Doesn't remove hair,"I have tried this shaver twice now and it doesn't remove any hair on my legs. I have not been cut by this shaver, however it doesn't cut the hairs either. I tried both wet & dry... no luck. Why would a company sell a product that doesn't even work?"
3,Not a bad Shaver,"I purchased this Shaver in a discount bin for $5.00. When I got home, I decided to check to see if this was a good deal. After reading the reviews it took a couple of days for me to get the nerve to try it! I used it in the shower this morning and was surprised to come out unscathed. I do have to admit it doesn't shave as close as a disposable razor, however I have never used an electric shaver before so that may be the norm. If you find this Shaver in a discount bin - go for it!"
3,Not a factory cartridge... probably a refill!,"I bought this thinking it was a factory cartridge in the green refill program, but the printer ink light came on immediately when installed. It is printing OK but I do not expect any where near the life of a factory cartridge, and we are paying ""per page"". The ink wars now are obscene. When a business installs a significant electronic circuit to prevent you from refilling the ink bucket so they can charge $.04 per page instead of the $.01 you can buy ink for... or $.005 I used to run my Epson for... it is a crime."
4,Black print goes green,"The prebate toner carterage includes (and REQUIRES) easy to use return postage for the empty carterage for refurbishment/refill, thus helping to keep our world green, even in Hawaii."
1,Worthless,"Mann is an interesting person, but he cracked no cases in this book. At best, he provided evidence that supported what police were just about 100% certain of already. I have no idea what he tried to accomplish by writing ""Forensic Detective;"" however, there is no doubt whatsoever that it is not worth reading."
4,Hard Drive,"Excellent hard drive, have had no problems with it. Excellent choice for the older computers that can take that many gigs."
5,Works Great,"I bought this for my MacBook Air and it works great! Some say that it wont allow you Macbook to close, but it does and it works just fine for about a year now with NO problems. It really is cheap insurance for you screen, highly recommended!"
1,This does not fit MacBook Air,"If you use this, MacBook Air won't close. RadTech make a cover for air specifically but this one is for regular MacBooks, not for air as advertised."
3,"Its ok, his marketing ideas are fresh","I got this book thinking I would learn something new, my advice is this: If you have a strong base in Business Consulting, DONT BUY IT. If you have NO business savvy, then its for you. He really knows his stuff, but I was disappointed as I expected something else, and since I work for a business consulting firm, I was more than surprised to discover that its a BUSINESS CONSULTING BOOK. I had expected lists of gear to buy, places to call, etc.I did find this book interesting in the respect that I already smoked his ""industry standard"" statistics, and liked his marketing ideas. I read it cover to cover. I dont suggest you follow his advice of opening a club in debt, and stay in debt. Its VERY easy to get and stay solvent. From the beginning.He also gives you great numbers and referrals of agencies to call, for processing and such. However, with the advent of the Internet, I found even BETTER ones out there!!!"
5,Excellent Book,"This book has inspried me to go on and open my own fitness center. Written in text book style, it's easy to read and loaded with great, useful information that will make opening a center easier. In addition, it has practical information for the business to be finanacially successful and have longevity. I recommend this book for anyone who is thinking of this business opportunity."
4,FITNESS BUSINESS,"Even though I was not impressed right in the beginning, I somehow liked it after going through the entire book"
5,Highly recommended!,"I highly recommend you this book if you are new in the fitness business. It shows you how to evaluate the business if you are buying a club. It shows you how to analyze the numbers. After having read this book twice, I feel confident that I will succeed with my new club."
2,pritty dumb,"well its not at all what your expecting, i would recomend ANY other arobic dvd. just watching the warm up shoud give you a clue. waste of money for the rental"
4,"Finally, a Carl Belew collection!","I have waited for many years for a collection of some kind to be released covering the underrated work of Carl Belew. Carl was (and still is) highly regarded as a songwriter, but he was also a fine performer. This album is a collection of songs released during his days with RCA Victor in the 1960's. Most recognizable to fans of that era will be ""Hello Out There"", ""Odd Man Out"", ""Boston Jail"", ""Walking Shadow, Talking Memory"", ""Crystal Chandelier"", and ""Am I That Easy to Forget?"". I gave only four stars because of the omission of ""Lonely Street"" and ""Pretty Brown Eyes"". Also missing is Carl's pre-RCA rockabilly work and his later work that included duets with Betty Jean Robinson.All in all, though, a very good collection from a solid artist. If you remember Carl Belew and liked him at all, this is the only collection you'll find to date. It's well worth the money for fans of ""real"" country music."
1,"Great premise, boring book","I bought this book thinking that it had a wonderful twist on apocalyptic science fiction, is a favorite sub-genre of mine. It starts out promising and then about a quarter of the way through becomes a woefully boring waste. The characters are one dimensional and one could care less about any of them. Compare this to someone like Jack McDevitt. In his novels one feels like one really KNOWS Chase or Hutch or for that matter any of the characters he builds. The characters in this book are downright cliches. I have to say that I had to fight my way through to finish it and wound up giving it away to a friend of mine who teaches Environmental Science. Thumbs down big time."
3,"Intriguing Premise, Average Execution","Premise: After an enormous oil spill in California an oil eating microbe is released to clean up the mess. The microbe becomes airborn and attacks all oil based materials including gasoline, rubber, plastics and lubricants. This causes a worldwide collapse to transportation, communication, and government.Character development is limited. 2/3 of the novel are build up to the collapse of civilization, perfect time to create intriguing characters. Instead the reader is introduced briefly to a load of 1 dimensional characters for whom it is difficult to build sympathy for.The setting is interesting enough to sustain the novel, and the efforts being made to restore civilization are different enough from other post-apoclyptic novels the rate 3 stars. I would read a sequel should one be written."
2,"A good concept, completely wasted","I picked this up in an airport based on the books concept (a good one). I soon asked ""why am I reading this?"" Its full of scientific holes and inaccuracies. Perhaps an alternate reality where everyone is dumb. If there is no more plastic, and you want to generate power, why try to launch something into space, just build a dam. This would be entertaining if you don't consider yourself very smart. The only reason I didn't give it a lower score was that I was able to finish it"
2,Great Concept--Pathetic Realization,"This was a fabulous concept for a book--a kind of Andromeda Strain, only the bugs didn't just decide to turn benign and fly off into space, but ate all the oil, natural gas and plastic on the planet. But the authors have no imagination at all. Their descriptions of how quiet and peaceful it is after the disaster in various places around the Bay Area evince the worldview of an unimaginative, media-fed fourteen-year-old boy. The main characters' obsessions with rail guns, small satellites and puny electrical generation schemes simply run past ludicrous to depressing. What about the ten million starving people?The fact that this book and ones like it can be written and published and read as entertainment provides a disturbing index of our society's level of conscience and awareness of the reality of human-human and human-environmental interdependence."
3,"Good concept, fair execution","""Ill Wind"" is about the grounding of a supertanker and subsequently a petroleum-eating bacterium which gets out of control. A broad story with ""a cast of thousands"". I found it hard to keep track of all of the characters. The description of the tanker, and of the grounding are accurate. The novel is particularly effective in demonstrating the dependence of modern society on petroleum and petroleum derivatives."
3,Disaster thriller entertains and keeps up suspense/interest.,"The opening pages, wherein an oil tanker collides with one of the towers of the Golden Gate Bridge and spills tons of crude into the San Francisco Bay, are pure suspense and realistic action. Sadly the multiple stories that follow are standard disaster thriller filler. The novel is far from boring, it's just that it suffers from the same problems with contrivance and characterization that plague other 'cast of thousands' disaster epics. This is strictly for those that can't stop themselves from watching The Poseidon Adventure or The Towering Inferno whenever it pops up on cable."
2,Fascinating concept but ultimately falls flat.,"Imagine a world in which petroleum products suddenly disappeared, along with all the machines and gadgets that use them. This would include gasoline, oil, and all plastics. That's the premise of this imaginative novel. It's just a shame that the authors couldn't quite flesh it out. It's an unusual techno-thriller in that there's virtually nothing military about it, which was refreshing. However, Ill Wind suffers from a typical failing of techno-thrillers, cardboard cut-out characters and painfully stilted dialogue, especially between men and women. It seems as if the authors learned their dramatic skills from watching canned television mini-series rather than reading real literature. The concept is enough to get you about halfway through the book, but then it just gets tedious and you find yourself praying for a nuclear war to just put an end to the whole thing."
2,Title is a bit misleading,"I was very pleased with the original volume of German Military Marches. There were some differing opinions, in regards to the sound quality of that cd, but nothing that took away from the selections.As the name of this title ""More German Military Marches & Polkas Vol.II"" suggests, this cd would be a addendum to the previous volume. This is not the case for this cd, as it is a completely different selection of tracks and genre.I am not a military marches expert, but I do have a collection and an idea of what I expect from a cd entitled Military Marches & Polkas. This recent volume is primarily a collection of bland polkas. Maybe a Polka fan would like this volume, but if you are looking for good military marches, as found on the original cd, look elsewhere."
3,Great first CD,"This second CD is mostly oompa beerhall music.My granfdfather had the original first CD on a 33.3 LP, good solid band music.There are better ones, I know there are, but good luck finding them NOT on an LP :(Maybe on Amazon.de"
3,AMAZON IS WRONG. IT'S NOT DUBBED.,Amazon's listing is wrong. There's no English track. The $60 list price is nuts for so few episodes of such an old anime with no dub. Wish I'd looked at my copy soon enough to return it.
3,007 + 90210 = HUH???,"""The Enemy"" is one of the most blandly titled ""thrillers"" ever. It stars Luke Perry,an alum of Beverly Hills, 90210, as a troubled young man seeking out his long-lost father. He has to find an antidote to a deadly biochemical weapon. Olivia D'Abo stars as his love interest/assistant. Former 007 Roger Moore is the head honcho who's largely skeptical of Perry's discoveries.The hirsute Perry's role consists of earnestly typing on his computer as he seeks out the antidote. Square-jawed Moore doesn't get much action, except for the shooting in the finale. There's the spectacularly mulleted villain, who's all business in front and party in back. D'Abo gets to look pretty.""The Enemy"" was mainly filmed in Montreal, so one gets to see the Quebecois rally to their defense. There's plenty of cheesy music. It's a classic B movie. 90210 + 007= 100% CHEESE, or fromage, in this case"
1,Terrible Book,"This was my first Stella Cameron book and it just might be my last. I wish I could rate this book woth NO stars! It was awful. I did not even finish reading it.The book starts out very slowly, but I was interested in the past that these two characters shared. After their history was described, however, the storyline degenerated into nothing. I could not figure out what the motivation was for any of these character's actions. Their personalities were never truly defined, and whatever spark of interest I had died with the convolted machinations of these characters.I never did figure out what was going on in the book. All I knew was some rich guy came back to his hometown, one of the reasons being he wanted to rekindle an old high school romance. But beyond that, I couldn't tell you. This book went on for pages and pages and pages about NOTHING before I finally gave up threw it across the room and into the garbage.... Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Really Bad,"Mousy lead female. Really good looking, arrogant male lead. Super weird 2nd characters. No plot. Disturbing! One of those books I will not pass on to others."
2,"Disjointed plot, disappointing characters, buyer beware!","I bought this book at the local book store without reading any reviews, a mistake on my part. I've read other books by Ms Cameron and been pleased, not so with this one. I actually checked the copy right date thinking this must be a reprint of an earlier work {NOT!} as the plot and character development were so lacking. I have learned my lesson and won't buy another of her books without first reading reviews...burn me once shame on you, burn me twice shame on me."
4,"instep belt ""no good""",Have worn these boots all my life and was very disappointed with the instep belt quality of my most recent pair purchased. Very thin and narrow compared to the rest of the boot's quality. I do realize this belt is just decoration for most who will make this purchase but it was meant to be fully functional to secure your boots. Hopefully the company will read their reviews and correct this problem.
3,Nothing special,"I feel this review should be more like 2.5 stars.This record had nothing particularly engaging to offer me, and even the deceptively beautiful first track really began to wear on me after repeated listening, which is not a good sign.It's a ""nice"" album, there's something hypnotic about it, but unfortunately that borders on sleepy all too often. And the female vocals, while on-key, at least, are somehow overdone. Breathy, amateurish, they begin to wear on your patience after a while.I understand the intent of this album, but for me, its purpose doesn't quite work out.Delirium has done music like this much better with ""Chimera""."
2,Listened to it once and sold it off,"This cd went nowhere and is just another ambient cd out there that fails miserably. This cd was worse than Delerium's last album. All the songs sound the same, as far as I can tell this album does not sound sexy, or interest any girls I know. The first song ""purify"" is the only song on this that sounds different than the rest of the songs. I should've done the smart thing and downloaded it and not have wasted...bux on this. I listened to it once and then sold it...DOWNLOAD IT DON'T BUY IT."
4,interesting and different,"different and cool type of music only a few of the songs are worthwhile to me, but it is interesting and different."
3,"sounds get a little depressing, but ""purify"" is brilliant","The album starts out very catching with purify, which I think is easily the best track on the cd, but as it goes on the songs start to all sound the same and get a little dark. Even purify has some depressive undertones overlaid with a naive front, but it has an energy and liveliness the rest of the album tends to lack. However, the great thing about this cd is that every part of it resonates a futuristic, sci-fi feel. The deep, ambient rhythms and distant melodies, and also quite importantly the slipcover layout, make you feel like you're living in future times.Overall I think this album is very pioneering. I've never encountered anything quite like it, at least in this branch of the new age web."
5,Well Put Together,"This CD is a masterpiece in my opinion. Starting from the first song and ending with the last one, the listener gets a smooth feeling throughout the length of the CD. Songs number one and especially number three are my personal favorites. I hope to hear more albums from this artist in the future so I can purchase more of his music. Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
5,"Finally, electronic music that doesn't get old!","... I must say that this is truly work of art worth every star possible. Not only is the music well thought out and beautifully done, it's actually catchy! It doesn't drone on and on like some electronic music does--it's very melodic and arranged very well. Beverley Staunton's vocals are entrancing, memorable, and unique. Buy it...you WILL listen to this album for a long time before retiring it to your rack."
5,Utterly Sexy,"The female vocals on this CD are the sexiest I have ever heard. This is a CD to make love to, the sounds are pleasing and invoke passionate thoughts throughout."
5,Sunday Music Anyone?,"I am a big fan of oldies/blue/r&b, although you would never know it.. unless you come to my home some random Sunday Morning jamming out, or popping my head on the subway. Percy Sledge is great, he is the original, ""When a man loves a women."" and with the price... not a bad deal, everyone need some Sunday grooving music!"
5,I have never really seen this movie,i just wanted to be the first one to reveiw it .... Props to Jimmy up at CopStat in north NJ
4,Interesting,"I bought this for my husband at the time when he wanted to pursue law enforcement - he read it fairly quickly and held his interest. Nothing ""new"" but nonetheless intriquing."
4,"Decent, but not comprehensive","A pretty good collection, although marred by less than great liner notes (lots of different stories, so this isn't a surprise) and odd track selection (totally omitted the best of the Jerry Fisher tracks).Sound quality is great, pretty good, but not great package."
1,Not the British TV Series,I was looking for the TV series from 1969 and got this movie instead. WARNING Amazon does not adequately describe this product
2,Dreadful Transfer,"It's a pity that VCI have given us such a poor transfer: VHS-quality made worse by crude attempts at sharpening and color boosting. The cover claims that ""This Special Edition motion picture has been digitally restored to its present condition."" Unfortunately its present condition has to be rated as awful. Not to be watched on anything grander than a 13"" television. This is a fine film that deserves much better treatment."
1,"Some laughs, please","This should have been one of the crown jewels of British comedy; it had the right cast and was made at the right time. Instead, it's just awful. The script for Doctor in the House is exceedingly weak. I couldn't even muster a smile. There is a bit of slapstick, and perhaps that will satisfy some (who might also enjoy a ""Carry On"" movie or Benny Hill). But this is not even near the major league films of the 1950s and 1960s that featured the likes of Ian Carmichael, Alec Guiinness, Alistair Sim, Terry-Thomas, Margaret Rutherford, Joyce Grenfell, Cecil Parker, Hugh Griffith, and George Cole. In short, save your money."
4,Happy to have this series,"Lots of giggles for movies made around the 50s. Popular humor changes over the years, but this set always will be full of good sight gags, etc. Quality is good."
2,Can't recommend this,"I can't really recommend this CD. None of the selections are the original recordings. You don't know this until you read the very small print at the bottom of the label. These are all re-recorded, and not very well. The music arrangements are minimal and can't compare with the original recordings."
1,I received my order after 7 month :-(,i received my order after more than 7 month as the order was on June2011 and i received the book on jan-2012 and i was already bought another one from another place as i thought that i will not get it. and now I have 2 book from this book. I'm very upset :-(
1,not very durable,Toy broke two minutes after I gave it to my four year old. Its a shame because he really likes it. He still carries it around and asks me to fix it. I cant.
4,Rockabilly Boogie,"Blue Cats are probably one of the best neo-rockabilly groups. This album is full of material before the band was known as The Blue Cats (they played as South Rebels, Blue Cat Trio and Little Tony & The Tennessee Rebels). Their influence was of course Gene Vincent, what you can tell by their name.This album is including rockin' songs of Gene Vincent & his Blue Caps, Johnny Burnette & His Rock 'n' Roll Trio, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins and their originals. So authentic rockabilly that you can hardly tell that it is recorded in 80's. Probably the best remakes of songs known by 1950s artists."
3,Not Really A Complete Listing,"Although the book has much to recommend it, it is not anywhere near a complete listing of all the world's fighter aces. Only the major ones are represented. For example, The German WW2 Eastern Front list of Aces only starts at about 150 victories and goes up from there. Where are the lesser Aces? Some lists of American aces cut off when you reach below 20. I have a number of items and prints that are signed by lesser Aces and I was hoping to use this book as an identifier: But,alas, I was disappointed. I will keep the book anyway because it does a good job describing each conflict and illustrating evolving tactics. The title and descriptions, however, are misleading."
1,NOT for jewelry making,1. the spring fell off from the plier the first time i tried to use it2. pliers are too huge for jewelry making3. pliers have ridges inside and do not close tight4. poor quality material
4,Texas banger with West Coast flava,"The DOC reps Texas but he is much more West Coast than Dirty South. This is because he was discovered by Dr. Dre and was an unofficial member of NWA. DOC no longer raps much because he damaged his vocal cords in a near fatal car accident, but his crew carries the album. Six-Two, who also appeared on two tracks on Dr. Dre's 2001 album, has the most air time on Deuce. And he really shines. I can't wait until he drops a solo. Dr. Dre and Jazze Pha provide much of the production and old NWA partners Ice Cube and MC Ren as well as former Death Row lablemates Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg make appearances. The albums weaknesses include too many skits and a few filler tracks at the end of the album. But if you are a fan of old school West Coast gangsta rap reminicent of The Chronic, Straight Outta Compton, and Death Certificate, then this is an album you must have."
3,The round up....,"i did not even consider getting this album at all at first. i mean come on the d.o.c. without his voice. but i was curious and i am glad i found this treasure. the doc has found himself 3 snapping young guns (6'2, two face, and deville) from texas. he has cube, dre, ren, baby, and snoop on this one. i am even going to go out on a limb and compare this (the way its set up) to the chronic. yeah u heard me, the chronic. remember how dre introduced the world to tha row and the dogg pound? well that is what the doc is doing.the production on this project is real good. u would think since its kind of an unoticed by mainstream release, that the beats would suffer but that is not the case. 6'2 ride tracks just like snoop does and he has way better lyrics. two face has real good gangsta muszick wordplay and deville is the pimp juice. go get this album, U HAVEN'T LEFT YET!!!!!"
4,Where's D.O.C.??? Make another Solo album!!!,"I was disappointed without the full presence of D.O.C. on this album. On your own albums you are supposed to be the one in the spotlight. Not with this album, D.O.C. has less than 5 minutes of mic time on the whole album. I think he could back in the scene if he went all out and had a true follow up to Helter Skelter. PUT OUT A REAL SOLO. PLLLEEAAASEEEE!!!!"
5,Highly Satisfied Customer from Los Angeles,This is the first time I buy from this vendor. I was very pleased with their service and the price. I saved closed to $100.00. I highly recommend this vendor.
2,Essentials of Contemporary Management,Was an out of date copy. Badly used. Could never get seller to respond to e-mail. Had to buy new book at college book store at full price. :(
2,I never receive the book,"I think this seller is unprofessional, i never got any response to my emails, and i never receive the book."
4,Good,I was surprised the book was downloaded and in a notebook. But I was happy that each page was included correctly. It did not interfere with my studies.
3,Important athlete for Alaska and Sled Dog racing,"The story of George Attla is one of fortitude, endurance, and a man's mind outsmarting his body. Thru all of these traits, Attla wins again and again in sprint sled dog racing. He is an impressive racer and leader to the Alaskan native population and racing community. I would like to have known more about his relationship to his dogs and his understanding of racing. However, it may be that such things are not shared."
2,Average Asimov,"There can be no question that Isaac Asimov deserves his place among the legends of science fiction. The original Foundation trilogy and the Robot series are canon deservedly so. Unfortunately, Earth Is Room Enough does not do justice to the Grand Master. The stories collected range from the fairly decent to the deadly dull. The sole stand-out is the brief ""An Immortal Bard,"" answering the amusing question, ""What if Shakespeare were alive today and taking a Shakespeare class?"" Otherwise, the collection is largely forgettable."
2,"Great Video, Horrid Music","The video was of very good quality, and Douglas Fairbanks is always incredible! The story is so different than most modern versions of Robin Hood, it was very interesting to follow. However, a happy honky tonk piano played the same tunes throughout the entire movie. When the mood should have been somber, or tense, or melancholoy, the happy honky tonk piano would not shut up! It really ruined the experience."
4,"Proof of Mailer's ""Best Living American Writer"" Status","Beautifully written, although a bit speculative. While not really settling any theories, this book is the first to get us into the mind of Oswald. It's hard to believe this intensely paranoid individual could have EVER been part of a conspiracy. A great read by a true master."
1,I gave it 150 pages to ensnare me; it didn't,"I stopped reading Norman Mailer's Oswald's Tale after 150 pages. Frankly, I was bored. Mailer opens his examination of Lee Harvey Oswald with an exhaustive, numbing biography of his wife Marina's ancestors and Oswald's adolescence in Russia. I did not care to know so much about Marina's cousins or Oswald's Russian girlfriends. Furthermore, Mailer writes these chapters in a simple, almost oral way, so they do not benefit from his wry, spirited voice and style. It is possible that the book improves once Mailer digs into the meat of the assassination and Oswald's potential motives, however I will never know for sure. Maybe Mailer should have started the novel at that point instead--then I might have read until the end. After reading and enjoying The Naked and the Dead, The Fight, and especially Harlot's Ghost, I found Oswald's Tale to be a disappointment."
4,Truth is more interesting than fiction (Most of the time),"Michener gets into this guy's head, and by the time you're finished reading this book you feel like you know Oswald better than your spouse --- a lot better than you wanted to. I found the book engrossing if at times a bit tedious with detail."
4,Revealing Information,"Like most folks who read this book, I've read countless books on the JFK assassination. I have not read one like this though; it's in-depth, detailed study of Lee Harvey Oswald is unmatched anywhere. During the course of my own study and conclusions on the killing of our president, I am appalled by the number of people who believe Oswald was some poor innocent bystander who was framed. Mailer's analysis reveals Oswald for what he was: a legendary liar, thief, scum and murderer."
3,Some insight but disappointing,"The insight Mailer offered of Oswald was at times suberb, especially his time in Russia. But all to often he raised points about Oswald's life that needed more depth. To me his conclusion offered me little, but rather left me wondering more about not only Oswald but the secrecy surrounding the assassination. My final comment is that it was all together to dry for my tastes, as I was expecting more from such an accomplished writer."
2,"Informative, but sub-par","While the book is certainly informative in respects to Oswald's personal life, many points are left on the surface, especially many regarding Oswald's role in the assassination. While Mailer's style is as excellent as ever, readers would do better to turn to Anthony Summers' 'Conspiracy', which is a comprhensive view not only of Oswald but of the entire affair. Also written from a journalistic perspective, it examines many of the areas that Mailer leaves to superficiality in much more depth."
3,Okay,"You get to read more detail about Oswald because of Mailer's access to material heretofore shut off from researchers. But Mailer's obsessions get in the way. He likes to dramatize things, and he is obsessed with sex. So Maria wasn't a virgin when she married Oswald, but gave the impression she was: gee, I bet that's a lie a woman has never told before! And Oswald was still a virgin at age 17. Well, in the 1950's that was probably true of most 17 year olds! If not over 50% of them, then close to it. And Mailer makes Oswald sound freakish because he was still a virgin at 17. That's what I mean about Mailer's obsession with sex (...). So here's a violent man writing about a violent man, which I find questionable. Mailer got access to files in Russia, because a go-between told the Russians Mailer ""was America's Tolstoy."" Tolstoy probably turned over in his grave when those words were said! But if you want to learn more about Oswald, this book is right up your alley."
3,The New Adventures of Mary-Kate and Ashley: The Case of the Flying Phantom,"Book:Mary-Kate and Ashley are on vacation when they decide to go to the famous airplain musium. That's when they discover that there not dealing with a normal vacation destination, The Phantom, a famous plan is haunted.Can the Trenchcoat twins find the villian or is it really ghosts?---My opinion:I liked this one it's your basic mystery and anyone who has seen Scooby-Doo could probally crack the case before the twins.That's why I give this three out of five."
5,Water Bug,Product seemed simple to install and easy to use. We haven't had installed long so can't give full review but happy so far.
3,Content is much better than the Construction,The stories and illustrations are good but the book itself will not hold up over time with much use. A sweet little book.
2,"Good enough, I suppose.",Mike telling Trey that he played too many notes the night before is almost worth the price of the DVD.
5,Great Video,"I Have been a Phish fan since about 1987, and all I have to say is that this video is a must for any Phishhead."
5,#1 bittersweet,"As a true phish fan bittersweet gets 5 stars from me because it has to be one of the best movies to come out in 2001 Awesome shots of the band relaxing, writing songs, getting ready and playing the Great Went. The bonus concert footage at the end of the video is some of the best live footage ever. definitaly get this video if your a phish fan and even if your not you will still think its great!"
1,Not good at all....,"I agree with Dirk Digglers review. I live in Burlington, VT and the talk around town is that the band split because of Tray's GIGANTIC ego that was displayed in this video. He was an arrogant jerk to say the least. The music was decent on here but I could not stand listening to Tray talk about himself over and over again. It seems as though he forgot that Phish has a few other musicians involved besides his beloved self. Everyone in the scene here is convinced that the band is done because of Tray's OUT OF CONTROL ego.....we'll see."
4,Impressive,"This dvd is one of the best music documentaries ive ever seen. i was throughly impressed w/ the concert footage. The insight from all the members was excellent too. i really enjoyed all the trey interviews. His remdemtion of sleep was sub par, but he still delivers a good performance w/o giving away that he messed up. The wilson track is unbelievable. this is a must for any fans. my only complaint is that they should of showed more concert footage of the ""great went"", instead of interviewing fans. i did the like the scene where a fan approaches trey at the great went. she almost passes out in mid conversation. as stated earlier this is a must for all phish phans."
1,"Terrible, just terrible","I have to give Phish credit for being decent musicians. However Trey Anastasio is the most self centered person in all of rock. He was so cocky in this video it leaves little to the imagination why the band is on break currently. For those of you who like to compare Phish to the Grateful Dead...think again. Just watch this video and think about all the interviews you may have read or watched with Jerry Garcia. Jerry was far more talented and he never uttered the words ""I"" or ""me"" in an interview. He was the most modest man in rock. Trey on the other hand can't get enough of himself. His favorite words are ""I"" or ""Me"". I was litterally embarrased listening to him speak. I live in VT and if I ever have to chance to meet Trey I'd love to ask him where he get's off with that attitude. How great can he be if his music only appeals to stoned 15 year olds? Perhaps the rest of the band realized that already...."
3,Easy,"1) Rockstars are not always that interesting. I have friends with more interesting personalities and viewpoints.2) Not enough good music. I've seen them play some damn good stuff. Sheech they followed them around long enough. Obviously the filmakers don't know when a band is ""on"" because they didn't put much of that in.As per usual in music movies, we'd like to see the BAND play. For some damn reason camera people always seem to think they are making an Orson Wells movie. Camera people: keep your egos out of it. Too many ill considered close ups at the wrong times. Too many shots of idiotic stuff like the parking lots, helicopters, the audience and everything EXCEPT the band INTERACTING. Groupies are less than boring, they're pathetic.The backstage stuff is crashingly boring. One wonders if a monkey edited the movie.Gave it 3 stars because I don't think it was the band's fault."
4,Interesting view of the road,"As someone who has ""toured"" with phish for many, many years, I found this documentary to be uber-interesting. Also, it helped that I was on the European and summer tours focused on in Bittersweet. I found it to be a good intro for newbies and a nice scrap book for long time tour heads. The only thing that I didn't like so much was it kind of made phans look either strung out ""druggies"" or just plain strange. Other than that, there is some great live footage from shows and Jon Fishman is a phreak (in the best way possible). I really dug it and I think that most phans will too."
4,"Great Fun, Brings Back Memories from Seeing Live Phish","Look, this is a lot of fun (no ""ph"" sorry). I get the sneaking suspicion that Trey knows any documentary - um - rockumentary, is going to come across a little Tap-ish. And that's part of the fun. I really wish they'd provided a ""play songs only"" option for the DVD."
1,Ladies and Gentleman....The Trey Anastasio Show,"Wow,I do dig Phish to some degree. But this video hardly about Phish. If you think that Trey is somewhat bright you may be amused. I would rather hear him play a blistering version of ""Stash"" than hear him speak. Maybe I am too critical because I am spoiled and listen to alot of Zappa and Grateful Dead so I know how bright a musician can be. Trey is NOT it. He pontificates like he Gods gift to rock and guitar. Hendrix and Zappa would roll over in their graves if they saw this because Trey is so arrogant.Think about their contribution to music, and then there is Trey....pathetic Trey"
2,a bit much,"My grandchildren really enjoy the Minnie and Moo books and I bought this one for them without really looking at it. I read it myself however, before reading it to them and was greatly disappointed by the references to the hamburgers as recently deceased acquaintances of Minnie and Moo. I have been a vegetarian for 13 years but do not feel it is appropriate to explain the reasons or images of slaughtering cows to my grandchildren before they are capable of handling this information. The story could have been just as much fun without the hamburger episode."
1,Good book sunk by the hamburger episode,"We read Minnie and Moo Go to the Moon and found that charming.This book doesn't live up to it. The hamburger episode just didn't seem age appropriate in a child's book where kids relate to characters. Beginning books don't often deal with death, let alone animal cannibalism.At issue, at one point, Minnie and Moo (the cow ""stars"" of the book.) are offered hamburgers which they later surmise to be their friends (now deceased) that we met at the beginning of the book."
2,"Silly, Not Funny","I find Cazet's slapstick and silliness offensive at times. I never find it very entertaining, because I don't find absurdity appealing. I love humor, but not the absurd. That said, I'm willing to accept absurdity that has its own internal logic, which this book doesn't. How does the story progress from Minnie wanting thumbs to Minnie wanting to go dancing? There is no connection at all: you don't need thumbs to dance. And then, why must the cows dress up in wigs, dresses, girdles, and lipstick in order to dance? Again, no connection between dancing and wearing dresses. And the cannibalism is a huge turnoff. The last two sentences make no sense at all, because two of the characters mentioned were never in the story to begin with."
1,Vegan nonsense,"My daughter brought this book home from school as part of her nightly reading list, and when she got to the part about the cows eating their friends, I stopped her and read the rest myself. She was not allowed to finish this propaganda for veganism. This is the worst children's book I have seen so far, but I guarantee I will be paying very good attention from now on. Disgusting."
2,!!!,"This is one of the weirdest books I have ever read. I was reading it to my little sister and she did not quite understand how the hamburgers could be Minnie and Moo's friends. I don't think that's a very good thing to put into children's books. Overall, this book was very strange! Don't spend your money on it, buy one of my favorites like ""The Berenstain Bears"" series or the ""Amelia Bedilia"" books."
2,Just OK,"If this book had been printed in standard font without whole page line drawings, it wouldn't be much more than a pamphlet. The stories were OK, but too simplistic (some only 1-2 pages long). Check out some other Native American folklore books before you buy this one."
2,If you liked Silverlock...,"and Your a professor of letters from the 1930's, and drunk you might get this but is really pretty incomprehensible to anyone else, even the well read."
1,FROM CLASSIC . . . TO CR@P,"What happened?!If you're reading this review, then apparently you've read or heard about SILVERLOCK by the same author, a parody so good that it would even give that parody-factory TERRY PRATCHETT a run for his money.What happened to the sequel?!I've tried to read this book twice. Both times I never got further than the first few chapters. Why? Because the book reads like a sick, cruel mix of Roget's Thesaurus and the most obscure literary references one could find. It's almost as if the author was thinking to himself: If my readers thought I was witty in SILVERLOCK, wait until they get a load of this!If you haven't read SILVERLOCK, by all means read it--it's a true parody classic for the fantasy and literature genres. If you have already read SILVERLOCK, I'd only read this book if you are some literary genius out to challenge yourself."
3,"Coffee table book, or better","I bought this book to provide me with some background information on bentwood furniture and it seems to me that it performs this task quite adequately. There are plenty of high quality color photographs of surviving furniture; these are combined with historic black&white photographs. The accompanying text describes basic principles clearly and provides a fair bit of history.I am not a Thonet buff, so I dare not compare it with other literature on the topic, but viewed in isolation it seems nice enough. At good coffee table book, or better."
2,Good movies good double feature,What can i say about crossover. Its one of a few movies thats nether bad or good . Its one of those flixs that if your off from work and want to relax. And have something to listen to pop it in .itll kill time .its one of those movies that if u have to pick between blackeagle or crossover . Ud chose the ladder and watch crossover. At least when u watch it u wont fall asleep doing it.in short all iam sayin is if u got free time give it a try u might find yourself enjoying it.
3,i didnt buy this for myself,"I guess this is ok, a friend of mine ordered it and i havent heard anything bad about it so it must be good"
2,weak movie,This movie has a very weak storyline that is not helped by the horrid acting throughout. Also there are only two basketball games in the whole movie which are not really entertaining. A bunch of slam dunks is really all you get in this one. Add this movie to your collection only if you are going for quantity and not quality.
2,Mind Boggled,This movie was horrible. It had bad acting and unbelievable scenarios. I had to give it an extra star because no matter how terrible it keeps getting you can't help but watch it to the end.
1,I wish I could rate it lower than this!!!,"This movie sucked from beginning to end. In fact, the ending was the best part. The acting was terrible at best, the plot was lame, the storyline and script was predictable, and for this to be a hooping movie, there were only 2 legit games. And the games were poorly staged rehearsals. They're staged in all b-ball movies, but these were hideous. The best actor was Lil' J.J., and since he's a comedian, he doesn't even count."
1,Way too easy,i purchased a Living Fitness ball that came with a sample workout for the abs.It was reasonably tough so i decided to get the full video.BAD!the hardest part of the video was on the sample!complete waste this video is horribly easy.Don't get it!
5,The ONLY Sybase book around,"This book is copyrighted 1996 but don't let that fool you. It is still the best book on Sybase ASE available. Of course this might say more about the efficacy of Sybase than the book, but we aren't reviewing RDBMs here.There are a few things that are lacking in this book but if you are just starting out with Sybase, either coming from another RDBMs or starting from scratch, this is it. A second revision would be most welcome as would a 'Sybase on Linux Unleashed'.To sum it up, if you want to use Sybase, buy this book."
2,Low Budget copy of the original,"The ""Skulls"" premise, based on well-established rumors and reports about Yale University's Skull & Bones Order, is a useful basis for a suspense movie. The 1st film was solid and featured quality actors and direction. This sequel has none of the same cast and was straight to video. It basically repeats the same plot theme of the 1st movie. This movie tries to be more racy than the first yet has weaker drama and dialogue. It was disappointing - perhaps someone will make a film about the real ""Skulls"" which would be MUCH more dark and suspenseful than the fictional ""Skulls."""
1,Even worse than the first...,"...and that's saying alot.The movie goes nowhere fast. With a plot as transparent as cellophane and a solidly second-string cast (couldn't they afford ANYONE we have heard of), the movie wastes our time with some serious implausibilities spliced together with laughable dialogue and a downright silly ending.Did the producers really think that this film covered any new territory that the first missed? It seems that both are based on the same book. Now, I don't plan on reading said book anytime soon, but it seems to me that when you make a sequel, you might want to have a few original ideas to make the vehicle interesting. Just a suggestion..."
3,Enjoyable But Mediocre Teen Flick and Its Two Loose Sequels,"First off, you can't really call this set a trilogy since its just a trio of movies whose only connection is The Skulls society. Secondly, with a minor exception of the original, the movies aren't really that good. I won't go into any details on the stories. Still, the price is cheap and the three discs take up as much space as one disc. Watch them on a rainy day or if you don't have nothing else to do."
2,NOTHING NEW,"If you've seen THE SKULLS, the first in this suspense trilogy, then you won't find too much new in this second entry. Once again, a naively innocent young man seeks initiation into this supersecret clan of collegiate powerhouses who demand secrecy in all they do. When a young girl is accidentally murdered and the crime covered up, our hero steps up to expose the organization, but not without resistance from the group. There's not a whole lot of suspense generated, with the outcome fairly predictable. Robin Dunne doesn't have the charismatic presence to command the movie and the supporting players don't fare much better, although Lindy Booth does well in the role of the innocent Kelly. This direct to video did well enough, though, that it spawned a third entry, this one with a girl trying to infiltrate the group."
1,The original reborn......... with bad acting,I immediately wanted to see this film because the first one was so good. From the first few minutes I lost attention fast because of poor acting and a week script. They derived the whole movie around the first one. The main character seems a little unaware of how a skull is supposed to act and he wanders around trying to act JUST like Joshua Jackson. You will see very similar scenes and characters trying to repeat what has already been cast in the first one. I saw little difference overall between the two movies except for repeat performances and bad acting. I hate to say it but this was a waste of film.
3,[Out of Five] Continuation of secret Society / Fraternity...,"Doesn't further develop anything revelingthough. Characters more likable than firstbut not enough suspence (or conspiracy) totop the first and most original in this Se-ries. Yes, Virginia, it is about THAT Frat-ernity, the Skull and Bones of Yale. Or atleast it's Jr. Varsity, the Scroll and Key[see: Fritz Springmeier's 'Bloodlines ofthe Illuminati' for definitive treatment!]."
4,supense,keeps you gusting great movie and you get 3 in 1skulls and skulls 3 my favesgreast DVD quality
4,Good cup!,"My son is going on 10mon and has been drinking out of this cup religously for about a month. I do like it, it is a bit bulky but he has no problems holding it or drinking from it. I would give it 5stars but they don't make replacement lids for it which is the only problem with it. Our sippy doesn't leak normally but it has a few times. I love it and most importantly our son loves it."
5,Great cup!,I love this cup! The handle clicks in so it lines up nicely with the spout. It doesn't leak at all! My daughter is almost eight months and has been using this cup for the past two months without any problems.
5,Excellent Cookbook,"I love this cookbook. I was looking for a new seasonal cookbook with relatively simple recipes. The Alice B. Toklas Chicken with the roasted sage potatoes was wonderful and easy, the sauce with the ruby port and orange zest was superb. The photographs made unfamiliar recipes to me like the Tartiflette look really intriguing and approachable. If you're looking for fresh inspiration, you'll find it here."
4,Super Entertaining Ideas,I've been entertaining for over 20 years for family and friends and was looking for some new ideas. I tried some of the recipes in this book for my last Christmas party and they were a huge success. I can't wait to try some of the other seasonal ideas in this book.
1,Not my cookbook,"... I'm trying to edit my review as I feel I was overly harsh. But amazon will not let me update the 1 star, to 2 (or 3). I realize that while this cookbook is defintely not for me, it might be ok for another type of cook. I want to hear about the FOOD, not about (what seemed to me) to be pedantic stories.I ordered this cookbook on a whim, and realized I had made a mistake. I found the author way to concerned with name dropping and using exotic ingredients. For me, Pamala Anderson's 'Great recipes for having people over' is elegant simplicity."
3,"Great product, but this price is high!","This is a really neat product. It works great to make little stickers out of little die cuts. though certainly not a necessary part of my scrapbooking world, it is an inexpensive addition. You can get this product at any craft store and those stores all have coupons on their websites weekly for savings around 40% off of one regularly priced item. so as long as the item isn't on sale, you can use the coupon and get it for less. I paid 5.99 for mine. this is true for the refill cartridges too, buy them using the same type of coupon and get them for 40% off as well...my refill was 3.59 with the coupon."
3,Not in love...,I love to scrapbook and I bought this item to help with that. I'm not sure I love this product. Stickers are smaller then I'd thought. The way it works is pretty neat but again... not sure I'm sold on it.
5,Xyron,I just brought is last night at a craft store and I got to using it one time. I did not stick!!!! I found it easy to use and share with others... I don't know how I was living without this all my life!!!
3,It's good,"I bought this product a week ago and went to work!I'm a graphic designer and bought this to use for small projects both professional and personal. Also I have created stickers before and got them made through sticker companies online and haven't been pleased by the look and how much I paid to get them made; so I figured I could just do it myself.Of course like most people what attracted me to this was the price. I like it! It's quick and easy! I've gotten a lot of things done within the week I got it. My only complaint is when I ran thin paper like regular computer paper through, it was difficult to get it in and difficult to get off the strip with the adhesive on it. My advice would be to use bristol paper or a thicker card stock. And I will say sometimes the adhesive back could be a jerk."
3,mmm pass,The larger version of this product make better sense. Product works as it should but 1 1/2 inch is to small. Most of my die cuts are just large enough not to fit. I think I would have been better off with the 3 inch. My advice use the Xyron adhesive runner instead for small items.
2,a $10 glue stick...,"Like a previous reviewer noted, the Xyron Sticker Maker does nothing to the front of the item you insert, it just coats the back with adhesive. I wish I had read that review before plunking down almost $10 for a glorified glue stick."
3,Cute and Funny! A Must for Bardotte Fans!,"Charming, funny, and full of local color, Doctor at Sea is a pretty good comedy from the '50s. As a Bardot fan, I especially loved seeing a very young, innocent, and yet whimsical and funny Brigitte on screen as well. The sound is very clear and the quality of the picture is amazing as well. Recommended for any fans of British doctors and/or BB."
5,Biggest Fan.,My wife loves Robbie Williams. What a great Entertainer he is. Saw this fantastic concert on TV and have been looking for the DVD for ages. I found it here and ordered it right away. This is the best buy you will ever make. Truly pure entertainement.
5,Robbie - you are a God!,Wonderful to relive the experience! Travelled from Canada to Knebworth for the concert and he is every inch the showman.Robbie - you are a born entertainer.
2,An ok read...,"Jeff Smith starts this book by saying he doesn't believe in getting more equipment than you should and that a lot of stuff is unnecessary gadgetry and bells and whistles, etc., but then he does not use that philosophy when describing ideal setups. As someone who does not have a high volume studio, some of his advice and explanation is impractical and almost impossible to implement.He comes off a bit preachy, but does have some good points that made me evaluate my style and consistency and he does provide nice photographic examples of things he discusses.This book, like the other Jeff Smith books, reads more as a biography than a how-to, and although he discusses image as important, a look at his website can induce a cringe.Get this book if you haven't read anything by Jeff Smith and you want to hear how he does it (and he is very successful at it)."
3,The stories are great...,"though, as someone else said, some are disapointingly short, others are way too long. The biggest problem with Bogdanovich's homage to actors is him, or, more properly, his ego. Someone reading it really doesn't care if PB knew them or not; they care about the star he's discussing. Maybe Pete should write an autobiography so he can keep his other books pure."
3,This is OK,"This book is okay. Some of the stories are good, others are pretty lame. Irritating how Peter B. takes every opportunity to remind you that he used to bang Cybill Shepherd."
4,terrific,Bought this as a add on to the set my wife got me for Christmas. Works great added to as a second track.
5,Get This,"I Love You Lucky ause you know what you're singing about, and if you get this Cd you'll know too. Every time I can't find it I most buy a new one :) Get one and get hooked"
3,Scratched.,This is a pretty good movie that I have been looking for for a while. This particular item was not locked into the holder thing in the box and arrived with numberous scratches that made it very difficult to watch.
4,playpen,"it's good. really difficult having the instructions on the bottom and it had to be unfolded before we could read how to unfold it properly. Better than the teeny store playpens, although I had expected it to be just a bit larger. That was my fault."
1,Rate it? How can I? I haven't received product yet!,"I am still missing several of the items I placed an order for on 12/1 and 12/5. I am sorely disappointed. We now live in the state of WA and returned to Atlanta for Christmas. I ordered almost everything through Amazon due to past positive experiences. I also had everything sent to my sister's address to ease my burden of packing. Today is 1/11 and I don't have many of the items, including this one, that I ordered."
5,So Far So Good,So far the mixer has worked great. The 5 speeds work very well. The fact that it came with the dough hooks and whisk was an unexpected bonus.
5,great mixer and great price,You know you can't go wrong with Cuisinart. This mixer looks as good as it works. The whisks are smaller than mixers I have owned in the past but they do a great job - even on mashed potatoes. Big thumbs up!
2,Not worth the money,"Considering the heavy processing power needed for the PC version, the graphics are not very impressive. The gameplay is boring, the AI is horrible, the only good thing about the game is the sound. You certainly don't get the feeling that your fighting in a jungle, more like the back woods of N. Carolina or something. Save your money. If you're looking for a good shooter get Far Cry, it's awsome. If you absolutely must have this game, give it a few months and it'll be $9.99 before you know it."
2,Shellshock Nam '67,"With so many obstacles in the game, wouldn't it make sense for your soldier to be able to jump over them? This is the only first person shooter I've played that doesn't allow the character to jump. Overall the game has some new things I haven't seen before like explicit traps and people getting limbs shot off, but the gameplay is horrible and not much fun. I'm returning mine today."
2,A Disappoinment,"I had great expectations for this game. Unfortunately it didn't live up to them. The artificial intelligence is ridiculous, and after you've gone through all levels that's pretty much it. It has limited replay value. On the other hand, if you like arcade style action with lots of gratuitous violence, this is your game. It does an especially good job of representing atrocities against prisoners of war and innocent civilians. If you feel like it, you can even slit peoples' throats. Be prepared for blood, gore, and miscellaneous body parts flying everywhere. All in all it's more than a little over the top."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,By far the most disapointing games i have ever bought. Shame on edios for even releasing this garbage. A total rip off the best thing about this game is when i turned it off..........DONT BUY IT
4,shellshock : nam 67',when i first bought this game i was a little disappaointed in the fact that it did not hav a multiplayer game type and also that there was absence of a tutorial but i mean the graphics are great amazingly realistic explosions realistic blood and overall good missions THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH THIS GAME IS ..... THE WORST ENDING MISSION EVER!!!!! all you do is defend the lz and hospital of your camp while under attack escort the nurses to the chopper and hold off the vc and nva and then take cover as an airstrike flattens the camp in the ending cutscene u see ppl searching for survivors and only u and monty (a south vietnamese fighter) survive weakest ending ever. still how can u not rate this at least a 4??? great game bad ending
2,Overall this game SUCKS!,"This game is not what it has been hyped up to be. I can't even bother to make it through the first level I found it so stupid. Your character is limited to where they can go, you can't even walk up a slope to get behind the enemy. The first mounted machine gun I encountered, I could not turn the gun to shoot the enemy behind me. I stood right in front of the enemy (point blank range)and kept firing yet not one bullet was hitting him. You can't even kill your own troops; Vetnam and you can't kill your commandor!? Wait a couple years for this game to be ten bucks and then buy it."
1,not worth the money,The costume was very expensive. It is very thin and can only be worn above some other piece of clothing. The cape tore right away.
2,"Flimsy, but very cute...","Bought this for my son's 3rd Halloween. He's 2 1/2 and is almost grown out of the size 2/4 I bought. He's big for his age, but not that big. It fits him, but if his torso grown another centimeter, I won't be able to get it on him. Having said that, EVERY seam is already ripping...he couldn't wait until Halloween to wear it, and I think that any little boy shoule be able to dress up like Superman whenever they want! I'm sure it will last five more days until Halloween, at which time I'll probably buy him a bigger, better quality Superman costume. I would probably have given it one star, but he likes it so much, I thought that should count for something! All in all, it's fine if you child will only wear it once, but if they will want to wear it more, I would buy something else."
3,small size and cheap,I did not like this costume at all first it was a cheap material and it only took one wash to ruin..
3,Great ppv event with a terrific main event,The main event war games match was awesome! I also liked the match between Macho man and the Giant. Other great matches were Super Calo vs. Rey Mysterio Jr. and Konnan vs. Juventud Gurerra.
5,His best novel,This book is flawless. You feel New Orleans and the 1960's creep up around you until you are immersed in the time and the culture and the paranoia that came with being a black man in that culture. The story and characters are complex and fascinating. Great writing...addictive.
4,TPOH delivers the goods every time!,"I'm so glad to see these folks are still puttin' out the jamms! With all the sound-alike bands you hear on popular radio these days, it's always nice to find a new TPOH CD on the rack. If you can find any of their 3 previous releases, grab 'em! The lyrics and sound are unique and I can think of no other band to compare them with- that's what makes them so great. Definitely good traveling tunes. Keep them coming Moe!"
3,I lied,"I Didn't know this rockin' Canadian outfit was still around as I hadn't heard from them in a few years. I will try to give their new stuff a listen, but it's just too bad their best stuff on the Chrysalis label, ""Love Junk"" ""One Sided Story"" and ""The Downward Road"" are no longer around. If you can ever dig those 3 up or come across in a mark-down bin, go for it! These guys RAWK!"
2,C movie at best,"This movie is a C movie at BEST. The sound is awful and the substance is bare bones. Lets put it this way it's just a step above a home movie, and that's only because you can tell the actors were really trying....."
3,Pretty good,Doesn't include everything... but it helps. Nice tips from the developers. Good overview of items and skills. Maps a little hard to follow.
3,A bit disappointing,"First, let me say that this is a useful book. But compared to other guides it falls short.1. I was disappointed that there was no large map showing the complete DS2 world.2. The smaller maps (and many are VERY small) were often difficult to understand.3. Sometimes the help was less than helpful. eg One secondary quest requires you to find four locations. Instead of describing where to find them, it simply says ""check the maps in parts 4 thru 6 for precise locations."" That means you have to troll through 110 pages! The maps have marked locations, but the legends are never in table form--you have to read through many paragraphs to find what you want.I found myself using the free walk-thrus available on line more often than the book."
4,"A Decent Book, but missing some things","Overall its a decent book. It misses some things that you can find online that would make it more valuable. Overall for maps, info on quests and spell info its great."
5,Can't beat the bargain,"A 300-thread-count, 100% cotton set of queen size sheets for $12.99?????? These deserve 5 stars on price alone. Plus they're decent quality, too. Sure, they won't compare to $500.00 sheets. But for everyday use, you couldn't ask for much more. $12.99??? I'm still in shock over the price."
3,An Interesting Quest,"Author Tim Everett incorporates mythology, religion, folklore, and science fiction into his novel HAM AND ABRA IN THE SEED. Everett draws readers into the world of Ham and Abra, two young lovers on a quest to discover the mystery of the seed. In order to marry, they must uncover the truth, and to do so, they enter the past to answer many questions. What answers do they discover in their quest? Will the answers solve the mystery, thus opening the doors to their marriage?Although Everett offers a story with many plot twists and turns, my only criticism was that I felt a lack of clarity in the story's message. While the story is one that is very unique, it left me with many unanswered questions. Despite this, Everett has presented a commendable literary effort and readers of science fiction and mythology will find HAM AND ABRA to be an insightful read.Reviewed by Kanika A. WadeThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
2,Didn't work for us,It did not work for us at all. The one we got before from a different brand works better for us.
3,Harmless Adventure,"I picked this up in a book clearance for 49p from WH Smiths. The last time I bought a book for less than 50p in Smiths was when I was collecting Jennings in the late 70s! Sadly, I Did not realise this was book 3 of a series when I bought it, and that did not help my enjoyment of the story. The story was a little formulaic and not greatly enthralling. The idea of the protagonist being an ""unmagician"" - special for his lack of magical powers had undertones of O S Card's ""Harts Hope"", but this was a very different story to that one.If I had started this series at book one I would have enjoyed this one more. But I also doubt I woud have persisted with the series. The intended audience may feel differently about it - but as it was in a book clearance - maybe not."
4,Works well.,"Got this for Christmas along with the White Night back-up light. The item is much larger than I expected, but appears to do the job just fine. I had to insert and remove it a few times before the light worked. I have never used the 7-pin connector in the 5+ years I have had the truck, so there must have been some corrosion. Makes installing the light a snap. If you get the light and have a 7 pin connector, this will make your life much easier."
4,"Fun, but you might want to wait-Update- Vol 3 is announced","I have enjoyed all the Patlabors that have come to DVD. My only complaint with this one is, the last episode of this DVD is continued on the next one, and guess what, there is no announced date as to when volume 3 will be released. So my advice is wait until they announce the next one or even wait until it is available or you will really have a cliff hanger.Good news Central Park Media has announced on their internet site a Nov 4 pre-release date for retailers and a Dec 2 public release. The cliff hanger may finally come to an end."
4,Does what it needs to do,"Well, it seems my old Hawking wireless adapter has finally gone kaput - time to write it's obit. Since I cracked the case a a year ago, I'm not really surprised that at long last it's no longer functional; at least it did run for a good long time after that incident. In any event, I got this card for my PB G4 so that I could get WiFi on my boat when it was in the marina, since the internal antenna wasn't going to cut it. Reception went from completely unusable to just barely useable - which was about as good as could be expected given the circumstances. A couple downsides that you need to know:1) The case is somewhat flimsy, it's fine with normal use, but don't be a doofus like me and push you computer off a table with the card inserted (I was just happy the computer was unscathed!).2) ALWAYS power down the card before removing it, bad things happen when you don't."
2,passable,"Ok, I get great reception with this card. In that respect it's a good thing. However, the hinge and antenna assembly is a poorly designed and made of flimsy plastic.The hinge feels like it's about to break every time I gingerly open it up.More bad news...Terrible software and drivers. When the mac goes to sleep- expect a CRASH.This is mac device that was designed ad build for the windows market. that kind of barely-functioning, cheap build quality, hidden in shiny white 'macish' plastic.i'm disappointed."
1,"company doesn't deliver, customer service won't respond","Do NOT order from this company. I ordered my stuff and the order has NEVER arrived. I have contacted customer service repeatedly, they tell me in 38 emails that the product was never shipped. I keep trying to CANCEL the order but they keep insisting they are going to ship one day but they can't tell me if the product is in stock or not! I am extremely frustrated. Customer service sends me auto email to contact them again if I don't hear from them in 48 hours. I never hear from them, I have written them repeatedly and they ignore me. Their phone number never works, you are on hold for hours. No one will talk to you. This company is a scam. I also think they sold my email address. The day after I placed my order I recived an incredible avalanche of junk emails. I was flabbergasted. Do NOT order from this company, they can't deliver!"
1,Lots of errors and omissions,"A few unpleasant facts for Pleasant (the editor): Gathering together a bunch of your buddies and asking them to write a chapter for your book does not constitute good journalism and does not result in a good book. Omissions: I was looking for info. on the early punk clubs (The Masque, etc.) in this ""underground "" guide. Nothing. I also saw a listing for Jerry's Famous Deli in the book, but the writer failed to mention that Andy Kaufman had worked there as a waiter at the height of his Taxi fame. Errors: Too many to spell out, but one that made me slap my forehead was a writer's contention that Hawaii Five-O had been filmed at CBS Studio City with ""ocean footage edited-in"". In fact, that was probably the first television show to be shot entirely on-location, with interior scenes shot in their own studio in Hawaii."
1,I wish...,"The story is about Devnee, a plain girl who constantly wishes to be beautiful. Her wish is finally granted by a vampire but as everything does, it has consequences.I wish...I wish that they never reprinted this book. It was a waste of time and money. I absolutely hated Devnee as a main character, she was selfish, self-centred and cared about no one but herself.Devnee was probably even worse then the vampire, and so dumb witted. The plot was stupid, the dialoge good but the internal dialoge beyond redemption. The ending should have been trashed and Devnee made me want to rip out my hair. She knew what she was doing was wrong, but she was like a damn osterich.There is really no words to describe how stupid this book is and if i were you i'd stay as far away from it as possible.If by some mishape you do read this, you have my condolences."
5,Why Another Clinton Book?,"Why another Clinton book? Because the man who occupied the Oval Office for eight years was seriously disturbed when it came to women. It was not that he was a happy go lucky lothario who had a weakness, a sort of Charles II of the modern age. Rather, as this book documents, Bill Clinton has a darker relationship with women. He uses them as implements for his own selfish urges. When they objected, he used the power of the government he controlled to crush them. It was as if he were a medieval monarch and every woman who passed his line of sight was his by right. We may not see his like again--if we're really lucky.--Mark R. Whittington (...)"
5,Their Lives: Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine,"Excellant read - verifies much of what many with half a skull already knew or suspected - all the more reason to ""Let Lying Dogs Sleep!!!"""
1,Boring Rehash,"What a boring rehash of the same old Republican lies. There was absolutely no research done to crank out this piece of, er, nonsense. I'm surprised that Regnery press didn't publish it. The man's been out of office for 5 years and he's still being slimed.I can remember my grandparents referring to FDR as ""that man"" rather than speak his name 30 years after his death. I imagine that today's Republicans will be still be smearing the Clintons at least 25 years from now. Successful progressive leaders scare them more than anything else."
4,The Better Fiber Option,"Price, taste, nutrition, and fiber-benefit flat out beats anything Metamusil could market, and it's organic. You can't be the value of this product. Need I say more?"
5,exactly what i wanted :),i realized that i wasn't getting any omega-3 fats in my diet so i looked for the right thing to do so and i came across this product. I ordered it and was completely satisfied with what i received. the price is very fair and i will definitely be ordering again in the future!
5,Love this ground flaxseed,"I love this flaxseed, it's delicious and nutritious. I add it to pancakes, waffles, breads, cereal, etc to add some much needed omega 3's. It's easy to store and use. I keep on buying it and my whole family loves it."
3,Disappointed,"This was purchased on the recommendation of Dr. Oz in a women's health magazine. He stated weight loss was initially 12 pounds in one week. I knew it was extreme but was hopeful. In two and a half weeks, I lost one and a half pounds. The taste is good, very light, and does not ruin whatever it's on. I will not buy this again."
3,Pleasant comedy,"Doctor at Large represents a typical light-hearted British comedy of the 1950s: Plenty of banter, lots of tomfoolery between the sexes, and a slew of comical episodes connected only by the barest of plots. It is all quite delightful and amusing, if not particularly sophisticated. This particular genre of films continued with a number of additions to the Doctor series, and is kind of a precursor to the Carry On films, which managed to take the level of humour down a couple of notches further.Afficianados will take great pleasure in the supporting cast, which is positively overflowing with familiar names and faces from British films."
4,HIGHLY ENJOYABLE,"Ignore the naysayers that call this dvd ""disappointing"". It was very funny and while it is rare and high priced now, I strongly recommend picking this one up if you can find it in the $10-15 range. It isn't worth more than that,however."
3,prosthetic adhesive,"It wasn't as 'adhesive' as I would have liked it to be, but it did the trick - I was putting on pointy ear-tip prosthetics for Halloween. If my hair brushed the ear tips a little too much, the tips started to come off. I'd think it would have been impossible to do a witch's chin prosthetic (like they show on the packet) with how weakly it adhered. Also, there were no instructions with it. I was expecting there to be at least a ""let sit for __ minutes for proper adhesion"" and some sort of instruction on how to use the remover, but there was nothing. Overall, it did the trick, but I question the quality. If you want something cheap and for a one-time use, this is a good buy, but if you want something more - I would suggest looking at theater makeup, etc, and not just Halloween stuff..."
4,Works well.,It does it's job. No complaints. I have sensitive skin and it didn't bother me. I'm glad I got the combo with the remover. It helped get any residue off.
5,Works great,I used this on my daughter at Halloween and was really impressed by how well the remover removed the spirit gum.
3,Prosthetic Adhesive a Toy?,Really odd rating for this product... It's a decent product to have in your Halloween makeup kit.
5,Spirit Gum,"It's funny, when asked to rate this it lists it as a toy. Fast shipping, thank you! Can't wait to use this to attach elf ears with my costume :)"
3,"Great music, poor delivery","This album is a classic, for anyone who cares for Landowska's brilliant, eccentric artistry. But its arrival in my collection was a difficult one. The first try resulted in a jewel case in which the prongs holding the disc were broken. And the second try resulted in a jewel case cracked on the outside. In the end, I had to use pieces of each to create one good version. Plus, there was the attendant return process -- trips to and from the UPS store and various calls to Amazon regarding credit -- which proved a real drag. The whole process was frustrating, and though Amazon did ultimately fulfill its obligations, this experience made me long for the days when one could buy such goods at brick-and-mortar establishments."
4,Awesome,"A little bit more expensive than other bluetooth headsets in the market, it's the best! I spent days to research for one for my Nokia 3650, then got the Jabra BT200, didn't work out (Jabra says that the older version doesn't support Nokia 3650). Then I decided I should really stick with Nokia.I hesitated at the beginning because I didn't like the color scheme, but then I got over it. It is much much smaller and lighter then I expected. I realized that I don't really look like someone wearing a big gold earring as I thought I would be.It works with my Nokia 3650 like a charm. I have read reviews saying that the ear loop/ring tends to break, I guess I will have to wait and see. It does look a little bit fragile.The 1 star that it doesn't get is for the color scheme and the seems-to-be-fragile ear loop."
2,Nice Jersey not right,The image shows the tie up Rangers Jersey. This not the lace up jersey. That makes a huge difference what was a good deal is now just average for any other cheap Starter brand Jersey bought at K-Mart. Misleading just pay the $70 for a Rangers Closeout on their web store.
4,Fun Read,This book was really an enjoyable read. I got into the book right away and really enjoyed the characters. It reminded me of something that Lizzy might have read and commented on.
2,Can't get into it...,I'm having a hard time getting into this story line. I think the language/dialect is distracting me. Hopefully it will get better.
4,Sweet!,"Cute and romantic story! Twists and turns, but ends out all well for the heroine and her associates. I will recommend this story!"
2,Amusing but slow moving,This book was amusing in places but it was slow moving most of the time and I kept wondering why I was still reading it. I probably wouldn't bother again.
2,"fun, but avoid hard surfaces","For the five or so minutes that this was airborne, it was a blast. It handled fairly well, and I was able to control it easily enough. (And considering that this is the very first RC plane I've ever used, that was comforting.)Unfortunately, the design of this puts the propellers at risk every time it crashes. One of mine broke as the glider clipped the sidewalk. I guess i'll be stopping by the hobby shop this weekend to see if they have anything that might replace the prop."
3,It's all so simple...,"Good cover, nice photos and is beautiful for his simplicity but if you are expecting something more, like make-up techniques and ""how to do it"", think twice before you buy it.I expected simplicity, but not too much...!"
4,Great Rack!,This is an Excellent Rack and provides that extra capacity when you need it. I don't use the additional cross-bars that were included but could see how they could be of use. I highly recommend the cargo net as well as it is the simplest way to secure your cargo quickly and safely.I do tend to leave the rack on all the time rather than remove it when its not in use. If you are doing so as well you will need to keep your eyes open for low clearance garages. Without the additional cross-bars affixed on-top you should comfortably look for at least a 6 foot 8 inch clearance or more (assuming the rack is empty).
4,Intéressant,"Un ouvrage bien réalisé, avec d'excellents musiciens, mais par contre, peu de pièces sont accessibles au grand public. Très expérimental, avec une touche de Frank Zappa et évidemment, l'écclectisme de Lussier. La pièce ''café'' est si enjouée, par contre, dans le style ''tombola-rasa'' et mérite le détour. Je suggère ce disque à ceux qui tente d'en découvrir plus sur Lussier après avoir écouté l'excellent Tombola Rasa."
3,Disappointed,"Despite it saying you could be taken to any hardware store to be tinted it wasn't true. Most places wouldn't touch it because there was no formula tor intrstuctions to be found anywhere to tint the paint. It got fluffy when the people at the hardware store shook it theb they let it sit for a week and it never went down. In the end some of the product had to be dumped out to make room to tint the paint. The color was okay but wasnt easy to work with and very textured, sadly don't know how well it'll work as a chalkboard. The good part is the magnetic paint that is under it works so it'll at least be magnetic!"
5,Great album for your grandma,"get this for your grandma. It'll be her favorite album. There is no dirty words in it at all. She'll be impressed.***************************************************************but seriously, this album is amazing. i just saw them live last night.( i got this cd there) something i'll never forget."
3,not so great,"The problems are pretty repetitive and cookie-cutter. If you know ASCE 7 and how to do flexible diaphragms, book is kind of useless. Also some of the questions are just plain WRONG (there's no such thing as an ""earthquake period"".)I wouldn't really recommend this book."
2,It would be more useful if there were not so many mistakes,"The problems are helpful and good practice... but for a 5th edition book, it is inexcusably littered with mistakes. Some mistakes are as basic as having the explained solution correct and making sense, but the answer to the problem was wrong. Others gave completely the wrong information to the problem such that it is impossible to solve. Id say use Hiner for better study material."
1,Out of date - make sure you get the fourth edition,The third edition covers the 1994 UBC and is no longer valid. Make sure you get the 4th edition which references the 1997 UBC. The third edition is essentially worthless.
3,decent book with numerous errata,"like all PPI books this one is decent as far as covering the correct material. what bothers me is that it contains dozen of mistakes, errors, typos, etc. every ppi book i have ever used is like that. it is really disappointing considering that some of these books are in their 10+ edition."
5,Five Stars From me,Excellent book. It has masterfully simplified the difficult concepts of the seismic engineering by structuring design problems with their solutions.It receives five stars from me.
1,not as advertised,"It is not Windows XP compatible until after you contact customer service! The device driver that came with mine was created 01/05/2001. (I purchased it 06/14/2005) When you try to install the driver it insists that it has to have Window ME or 98 to work and then shuts down due to a ""Serious Error"". Customer Service wanted to help me correct lines of programming, I opted to take it back to the store and get my money back rather than fix their mistakes and help them get rid of an outdated product."
2,Forget it if you are running Windows 7.,"I ordered this product because it was advertised to be compatible with WINDOWS 7. It came with an installation disc but it was not needed to load. I loaded my 'floppy disc' & my files were displayed. When I clicked on the files they FAILED to open. I tried another floppy. Same result. This product DOES NOT WORK IF YOU ARE RUNNING WINDOWS 7. This product is USELESS to me. So much for ""truth in Advertising""."
1,Poor quality,"Although reasonably priced, this external floppy drive is of poor quality and doesn't last long (2-3 months). I recommend spending more for a better product."
3,Good Product but not what I needed,"I needed a device that says the month, day and year. This was the time."
3,flattering,"the fit of this bra was good compared to others the same size.it molds to comform to the body, will purchase again."
2,RUNNING SMALL????,"OLGA MAKES A WONDERFUL BRA, BUT, THIS AND ALL OLGA BRAS RUN SMALL IN THE CUPS, ESPECIALLY THE SIDES. NOTHING LIKE BALI OR VANITY FAIR, POSSIBLY LUNAIRE ALSO.I HAD PROBLEMS WITH THIS STYLE AND ANOTHER OLGA SIMIALR TO THIS, HAD TO REURN THEM, BUT, THEY WERE SO COMFORTABLE, JUST RUNS SO SMALL IN THE CUPS, I AM A 36 DD, SO THERE REALLY SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM. I KIND OF GAVE UP EVEN TRYING OLGA ON ANYMORE......THEN AGAIN EVERY WOMEN IS BUILT DIFFERENT, SO, TRIAL AND ERRORTRY BALI PASSION FOR COMFORT, TOTALLY AWESOME. GIVES YOU GREAT SUPPORT, AND COMFIE, AND A ROUNDER LOOK ALSO. THEY MAKE A MINIMIZER IN THAT STYLE, BUT, THE REGULAR PASSION FOR COMFORT IS SO NICE, MAYBE YOU WON'T NEED THAT MINIMIZER STYLE. I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE MINIMIZERS.THIS IS ALSO A GREAT T SHIRT BRA......I LUV IT.....TO EACH THEIR OWNTHANKS"
2,Really uncomfortable,"The general fit and support for this bra are just fine, and I like the full coverage and soft, stretchy fabric. However, the underwire pokes very uncomfortably under both of my arms. It is heavy underwire and where the underwire ends, it bulges the fabric out and literally digs into my inner arm just above my underarm area. After a week of wearing this bra, I had small bruises on both arms. I've tried to adjust the underwire to make it more comfortable, but to no avail. It's a shame because I really like the overall fit (other than it digging into my arms), look and feel of this bra - but I can't wear it. I bought a second one in a size higher (even though I bought the original in my ""normal"" size) thinking they ran small; however, the underwire still dug into my arm (AND it didn't fit correctly) so I had to send it back. I would not recommend this bra."
3,"comfortable, but not enough coverage",The lining is not substantial enough to prevent nipple show through--not a t-shirt bra.
4,great!,"I love this bra! I've got a pretty active job, and often work 12 hour shifts at the end of the day this bra this feels comfortable. The one problem I have with it (as I have with many other bras) is a mild rash from the stitching on the back. The first day I wore it, it did pinch under the arms a bit, but that went away by the second time I wore it. It's got great support, its OK to wear with a T-shirt. I wouldn't wear it as a sports bra. Over all I'm very pleased."
4,Very comfortable,"I find this bra very supportive and comfortable, specially the straps and the sides of the bra that ""hugg"" your breasts and there is no overhang. The color is beautiful and practical (warm taup) which I can wear under any color clothing being that it won't show through, giving a smooth outer effect."
3,Not Perfect,I have tried these bras before & knew that they ran a little small in the band so I purchased a 40DDD & still had to use a bra extender..I wear a 38DDD in other brands. Even with going up a size I still had a problem with the adjustable straps..they do not give much room for adjustment; because of this I found it uncomfortable & the straps dug into my shoulders leaving hurtful marks. Other than that the bra is really comfy & soft. It is a nice bra for the price.
5,Good Bra for the Price,"I also love this bra and think the quality, fit and construction are wonderful. However, I took a size up. But I still rate it very high for the price."
4,cacophonic,"megadope cacophonous jazz from a city that breeds cacophonic shrills & thrills. if you've never been to the beating heart of this place we call America, you need to listen to this album. if you have, then you know how good it is, si!"
5,The best Christmas Present Ever!!,"My brother bought this book for me and my husband...and I must say at first I was wondering why he was giving me a beer receipt book (I am a light beer drinker). Well quickly I found out this book was so much more! The last few days this book has brought my family together as we tried various drinks from the book. Yummy! How fun it has been!Besides having outstanding receipes, the quotes in this book are FANTASTIC! The author did a superb job....and I must say next time I travel through Pennyslavania I want to by a case of Straubs beer to try the drinks with the original beer!!Thanks to the author for crafting such a fun read!! I highly recommend this book to all ages (legal drinking ages)... you won't regret this purchase one bit (or should I say one drink)!"
2,Will erase credit cards,I bought this for my daughter to use on her vacation cruise. The magnetic clasp erased her room card and credit card. Kind of defeats the purpose of the clutch. It might be ok if you just used your drivers license phone and cash but people don't really carry cash and to have to have a credit or bank card reissued is problematic.
2,Undecided,"I can't really decide if I like the disc overall or not. Some of the songs are phenominal, while others are downright boring. ""Sunlight"" (Dj Sammy), ""Music"" (Darude), ""The Way"" (Divine Inspiration), ""Nothing But You"" (Paul Van Dyk), ""Show Me A Sign"" (Kontakt), and ""Is This Love"" (Terra Skye) are all awesome songs! Things like ""Simply Being Loved"" (Somnambulist) and ""As The Rush Comes"" (Motorcycle) aren't that great. Kate Ryan's ""Dénchantée"" is a great song but when listening to the whole CD through, it sounds like it was just kinda tacked on the end. Doesn't really go with the others. I'd say I'd give this CD 3 stars. I at first had 2 but after listening more carefully I realized I underrated it."
3,"Best Of Trance, Vol. 4","The latest installment in the ""Best Of Trance"" series from Robbins Entertainment is a very good trance CD. This isn't your hard-hitting, euphoric trance - this is euro-pop trance. Some call it cheese. I sort of enjoyed all of the songs here, they all sounded the same, though. This isn't a mixed CD, and the tracks are mostly radio-edits, but that certainly doesn't take away from the sheer ammount of tracks on this CD. I'd rather have quality over quantity. This CD has lots of very pop-ish dance tracks that not everyone would enjoy. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this CD to the hardcore dance addict - but for those who enjoy euro-pop trance, and to anyone looking out to get started in this genre. Certainly not the ""Best Of"", but it will have to do..."
3,5 repeat songs on this album from their other cds bleh,"I am not going to give an in depth review there are plenty of those, but I can say to you who have listened and bought trance party 1, 2 and 3- do not buy this. It has 5 songs that are on those 3 trance party cds and the songs that are new arent that great except the dj sammy song (which doesnt count cuz he is awesome anyways) I was hoping to love every song on here like I did with 1,2, and 3 but nay I did not. :P"
2,Cd was cracked,"When I received and Got the cd, I was happy, but when I opened it. It was cracked. But got the cd really fast."
4,All is mild enough not to cause my allergy reaction.,"I have an allergic reaction to strong scents and some detergents/soaps. I usually have to get a mild and unscented detergent. However, I found that very difficult once we bought our HE washing machine. I didn't realize the lack of variety available for the laundry detergent. I had been using Tide since that was all that I could find. Luckily, I didn't have serious skin reactions. However, I was not happy with the results I was getting. When I found the All online I figured it was worth a shot. I like it and will likely not go back."
1,"Great movie, but the DVD image quality Sucks!!!","Great movie, but I'm very disapointed with the DVD image quality. It just simply sucks! Acceptable definition of contours in close plans, but very pixelated in the large/wide plans, to the point that loses detail completely and the image is almost - and just visual noise!!"
2,OK Movie,"I was curious about the actress Kylie Travis, the movie was okay. I wish I would have got it in a dvd format."
2,Belushi makes the movie,"Stock fare about going back in time via a hi-tech device ( in this case, repeatedly ) until you get things right. Belushi is the psycho on the loose killer, making the movie run along quite nicely. Nothing new here folks, move right along!"
1,"weird, weirder and weirdest","I had high hopes for this since it is Disney and I had never read the book. This is by far the weirdest, creepiest, longest, boring KIDS movie I have ever seen. It is like a horror flick for kids. Just Terrible. Constant suspense that never really climaxes and a sudden really dumb ending. A total loss for me. And my 8 yr old kept asking me 'what's going on?"" about a hundred times during the movie. Too hard for kids to follow. The set and the actors are cheesy and fake. And it was so long I just couldn't wait for it to be over. Just awful."
1,"What Happened? Terrible , Butchered and Boring","I have fond memories of reading this book as a youngster. It is a wonderful book and about time I read it again. The movie is another story entirely. The movie starts out very slowly. You are introduced to Meg and her family. I found the actress who played Meg to not be very likeable. The rest of the characters were very flat and I felt no connection to any of them.I forced myself to watch in hopes it would get more exciting. Nothing really seemed to make sense or fit together. i only made it thru 20 minutes. I have little recolection of the real material from the book, but this at best was a very butchered mess.I advise those who think of viewing this to pick up the books. They are very fun. If you have to view a movie try the Harry Potter films or even the Lion the With and The Wardrobe. The Harry Potters are very well done and the Lion was pretty good."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!,"Okay first off I think this is such a weird movie that didn't make alot of sense. Also it was real freaky and I know this sounds weird, but it scared me! Charles Wallace's actor was a weird boy and why did everyone ALWAYS say his full name when speaking to him? Why didn't they ever just call him Charles? When they met those weird white yeti things that really disturbed me! The graphics and acting were horrible! I didn't even finish it because it was soooooo horrible and(I know i keep saying this)weird! Also when the kids entered the magical world they kind of acted as if they do it everyday. I'm sorry you have to listen to my complaining and bickering but i have to get it out! I'm sorry disney but this movie was very weird and freaky!"
4,I'm anxiously awaiting the release of the DVD,I heard the original release of the movie was three hours long. The details for this DVD say it is only 88 minutes in length. Can anyone confirm the length? Will the full version three hour version be released anytime soon?
1,Boring!,This movie is so weird and makes no sense. The story I never figured out. I have seen tons of movie 10 times better than this one. For me watching this movie was a waste of time.Apple

5,Best Movie Ever!,I have never seen a better or more touching movie in my life! Charles Wallace is super adorable! I recomend this movie any day!
4,great,"it arrived quickly, it was a great birthday gift for my daughter, she loved it and so did my son"
2,Zzzz,I loved the book as a child but this movie is definately a snoozer. This movie could have been done so much better.
4,High Interest in 6th Grade,"I have used the book ""Wrinkle in Time"" in my 6th Grade literature program for years. This DVD, a made-for-TV production, is not as slick as a major cinematic release, but is well acted and produced for its budget. My students find it entertaining, and I have used it after we read the book, or sometimes just to foster interest in the science fiction genre."
1,terrible movie.. save your money and buy the book instead.,"Madeleine L'Engle is, without a doubt, one of the most prolific writers of our time. A Wrinkle In Time is probably considered her finest work. This movie has turned it into a low-budget mess.I sat in my home and watched it with hopeful eyes, and all but cried during the entire movie for the sheer tragedy of it all.I believe Madeleine L'Engle, in a Newsweek article dated May 7, 2004, sums up the movie in the best way possible:NEWSWEEK: So you've seen the movie?Madeleine L'Engle: I've glimpsed it.And did it meet expectations?Oh, yes. I expected it to be bad, and it is."
3,Disappointed,"I am a huge fan of the book, Wrinkle in Time. I have read it many many times. That may be part of the problem with my dissatisfaction with the movie. It was as though the concept and major ideas came from the book, but other than that it was a sad representation of the printed work.Good points: The cast did a good job. I like the boy that played Charles Wallace. The house looked much like I pictured it. Who, Which and Whatsit were okay, although I pictured older women.Bad points: The special effects were downright pitiful. I used to laugh at the special effects on some of the cable-made sci-fi movies. But they look wonderful compared to this. The movie just did not follow the book. Things happened in different places, in different ways and just was a far cry from the book.If you have read the book only once, this movie might be okay. Frankly, I think it could have been so much better."
1,another film Disney should be ashamed of,"Along with, 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks', 'Escape To Witch Mountain', and a few others, this is another film Disney should be ashamed of. To try and pan this off as family fare is just one reason why the next reviewed film, 'Time Changer' (totally unrelated), exists.Psychic abilities, magic & witchcraft, crystal balls, etc. If that's what you want you children to watch then be my guest. I'll toss this one where it belongs...in the trash!I didn't even watch til the end.Not recommended."
1,"There is only one way to call this movie, ""Horrible""","PARENTS, READ THIS:DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE FOR YOUR YOUNG KIDS FOR CHRISTMAS OR ANY OTHER HOLIDAY OF THE MONTH.IT WILL GIVE THEM NIGHTMARES!This movie is the worst one I have ever watched and I am ashamed to say that Disney calls this ""a movie"".It is a very bad movie for young kids and in fact it is good for no one. This movie was nothing like the book and I found that even the book was horrible."
2,A disappointment,"I read Madeleine L'Engle's novel ""A Wrinkle in Time"" back when I was in elementary school. I heard of the movie release a VERY long time ago. I waited and waited and searched forever. When it finally came on, I was so excited. While watching the movie, I was highly disappointed. The casting was terrible, especially for Mrs. Who, Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Which. The happy medium was ridiculous as well as IT. The book was SO much better. Nothing was like I imagined it.AND, the cover of this DVD doesn't even do justice to the movie. It looks plain stupid."
2,A Wrinkle in Time,"My students read this book in class and were very eager to see the movie to compare it with the book. There are many differences between the book and the movie, but the students seemed to be content with the movie. I can't image how some of the images the author described would be created for the screen, anyway. The story was altered a bit. I would suggest reading the book before viewing the movie. The book is better than the movie."
2,Once Again Disney Insults the Public,"While it has been ages since I read the wonderful book this film was based on (so I don't have as much awareness of the changes made to the story), there is one major issue I take with the DVD: it is released in fullscreen.While watching the behind the scenes material, it is clear that this was filmed widescreen. Heck, the deleted scenes in the extras are IN widescreen. But how does Disney release the movie itself? 1.33:1.That is an insult to the movie-buying public: to hack off over 1/3 of the visuals that were filmed prior to the public release. Directors and cinematographers have reasons for including, or not including, certain things in the film frame. To tamper with that by chopping the film up shows no respect whatsoever for the source material.If Disney doesn't respect the film or the viewer, I certainly will not be buying this DVD. Nor do I recommend others buy this film."
3,Good correlation to the book,"I bought this for my students to watch after they read the book. I personally thought the movie to be a bit on the cheesey side, however my students enjoyed it and were amazed at the differences. They also commented how they were able to visualize the book better than the movie. It was actually a great moment for my reluctant readers! With that said the movie obviously is not an exact match to the book, but who expects it to be."
3,Why this format???,"Why oh why does Disney do such a lousy job with tranfers?It's 2004, Disney... there is NO reason to release a DVD in Pan and Scam only.It really is a shame, because the film was MUCH better when shown on Satellite in 16x9."
1,Horrible,"I can't even finish this movie. If I hear someone say the name ""Charles Wallace"" again I think I will be sick. A great disappointment."
4,Never judge a book by its movie,A well done (for TV) video version of the classic fantasy book by Madeleine L'Engle. Do read the book first!
1,Boring and unlike the book,"This movie is INCREDIBLY boring. I actually fell asleep less than half way through (The sad thing is, I'm NOT KIDDING). The part that I saw was not like the book at all. If they gave this movie a different title, I would not think that it was an adaption of A Wrinkle In Time. I LOVED the book and did not think that it was boring. For this movie however, I felt like the script was written in a week and a half, casting was done in 2 hours, and filming was done in a week. Watch the Harry Potter movies instead. The actors actually show emotion and the special effects are AMAZING (Unlike this movie, where the special effects are equal to that of a school play.)."
1,Really should be 0 stars,"This was a spine-tinglingly bad movie - I had been anticipating it for years. I couldn't even watch the whole thing. There were so many things ""off"" with it, I don't know where to start. All I can say is that when Madeleine L'Engle, the creator of this amazing book, says the ""I expected it to be bad, and it is.""that is a telling remark!Don't waste your time."
5,awesome starting point for beginners,"This book is an awesome first book on scroll saw. It tells you everything you need to buy, use and maintain your scroll saw."
3,fell apart the next day,"this book is good for beginners like me, but it fell apart the day after I got it and needed to pull out the old glue gun. if you are a beginner and want to get started right away I recommend the scroll saw work book, it really does get you started on projects your first time out. this book is good to get a little deeper into understand your machine and the blades and basic cuts. I don't like that you have to enlarge all the projects in this book, and many of the projects require other bench tools that you may not have as well. if you are looking to dive right in and are new, this is not the book, but I think anyone with a scroll saw should have it if you don't know how to maintain your saw, etc"
4,Show Me How To Create Quilting Designs,Show Me How to Create Quilting Designs is a very interesting book. I am looking forward to creating a project using the information in this book. Thank You
5,This book set me free!,"This book finally gave me the confidence to create and use my own quilting designs on a wedding quilt for a family member. Cathy Sandbach lives near me and I've seen a lot of her work, so I was hopeful of improving my technique and was not disappointed. She does give ready-drawn designs, but more importantly shows you how to draw your own and helps you let go and stitch the designs freehand. Without having to mark on your quilt top or use templates or tissue paper, the quilt is finished SO much faster and easier, and I was really pleased with the results. I highly reccommend this book."
5,"super,super,super",This book is a amazing magical adventure. It pulls you into the story. It is extremly imagitive and it plays a movie in your mind. I would recomend this book to anyone who is into magic.Harry Potter fans would love this book to.
1,PROBLEMS AND MORE PROBLEMS,"I tried to get this to work with my G4 running 10.4.3 it would read out a strong signal but was unable to connect to the web.According to tech support, they "" don't know anything about Macs."" I think it is a software driver problem and will check back later. I was told by the manager of COMP-USA that all that have been sold have been returned. Don't waste your time!!"
1,Absolutely TERRIBLE,"The Hawking HWL2A is one of the worst products I have ever bought. To begin with, the installation did not work right. It took two restarts and a physical disconnection and connection of the device for my computer to see it. The installation manual mentioned an uninstaller file on the CD that was not there at all. The device was very unstable and failed to recognize a wireless router that was IN THE SAME ROOM. Tech support was non-existent. After being kept on hold for nearly an hour, I gave up.I wasted a lot of time trying to make this device work. Please don't waste yours and stay away from it."
4,Works with Windows 7 out of the box,"I can confirm that this works with Windows 7 (tested it with Home Premium specifically, but it should work with all editions). No additional drivers were required to be manually installed - Windows 7 detected it and installed the drivers automatically, recognizing it as ""ZyDAS ZD1211 802.11 b+g Wireless LAN"", a wireless network connection. I connected to a Wi-Fi network and surfed online just fine."
1,the worst....,"Wasting so much time just trying to get this piece of crap to work. I think it connected to my wireless connection once, but upon bumping the plastic piece, it immediately cut out. Had a few crashes, and very little success. Should be removed from all shelves... oh and tech support is consistently giving me a busy signal. The worst of the worst!"
3,BAD tech support is the real problem!,"After repeated phone calls to Hawking and Road Runner, we gave up trying to connect and bought a used Airport card on eBay. When we still couldn't connect, we finally figured out that the WEP password needs to be entered with LOWER case letters, in spite of the fact that it appears on the bottom of our wireless router in UPPER case letters."
5,BETER THAN OTHER REVIEWS HAD POSTED!,I really enjoyed the show. It was a very funny and romanitic movie. The acting was very good and thescript was fine for television. I like Daniel over Dryfuss anyday. It is definetly worth a watch.
3,Goodbye Girl,This is a movie where you just sit down to relax for an evening of entertainment. It is not a classic or of superb quality in my opinion. I would order from the Seller again though.
1,"Goodbye, Girl","Despite being a serious Jeff Daniels fan, I cannot for the life of me figure out why some idiot decided that this movie needed to be remade (sadly, it appears that the idiot in question was none other than Neil Simon, himself). The 1977 Richard Dreyfuss/Marsha Mason original far outshines this version in every respect. Maybe I've seen it too many times. Maybe I've got a 25-year long crush on Richard Dreyfuss. And maybe if I hadn't loved that movie so much and saw the remake first I'd feel differently -- but I really doubt it. Okay, it's watchable. Just. Thus a single star. But this will NOT be one for the ages. Do yourself a favour -- get the original."
1,"Addio, Ragazza, Per Favore, ADDIO!!!","This remake merely serves to highlight the talent of Mr. Richard Dreyfuss; he makes it look so effortless when essaying the role of Elliot Garfield. Jeff Daniels seems to be torn between mimicking Dreyfuss and giving up. I vote for Option 2, as he's lost at sea without a compass in this ""performance."" Imagine a remake of The Godfather with Don Corleone portrayed by Ryan Seacrest and you're starting to get the flavor of this misbegotten misfire. Patricia Heaton was, I must admit (given her television work), surprisingly effective, equal to or better than Marsha Mason in the original. She earns this reviewer's single star awarded. Brava! In the end, all I want is the reason this ""remake"" was made in the first place, other than the expectation of it turning a profit, however meager."
1,soda without any fizz,"Ironically I did not appreciate the original version when it came out; I was younger and did not pay enough attention. I got this newer version in a combo pack and thought I was getting the older version, but I wanted to be fair and give it a shake. Heaton and Daniels, while talented and funny people, just do not deliver the high-intensity punch of Mason and Dreyfuss, who play off each others' stress magnificently. Even the child actress is mixed in better in the older version. Even Alan Cumming was robbed of his luster, which makes me even more sad. The performances lack intensity, stress, neurosis and heat. What was the point in making a clumsy, oatmeal version of an intense movie with perfect performances and casting?"
1,Goodbye to this bad Goodbye Girl,"Boy, is this remake a dud. Jeff Daniels is seriously miscast (he is too old for the part). But the worst thing is the rewriting of Simon's great script. By making it politically correct the rewriter has made many of the best jokes disappear or unrecognizable. Save your time and watch the Herbert Ross film again now that it is out on DVD."
2,WHY ?????????,"Except for a very few changes the script for this re-make his identical to the 1978 one which leaves your wondering why make it at all.The actors do go through their lines at a much quicker pace than on the original, my guess is they did it to fit a 110 minute movie into 90 minutes. I am more of a fan of Heaton/Daniels than Mason/Dreyfuss but the fact is the latter ones were much, much better. Unlike Mason's character which evolved so much in the original, Heaton's character remains exactly the same throught this new version which makes it hard to root for her. Personally I identify her so much with ELR's Deborah that when she started kissing Daniels it felt like she was being unfaithful to Raymond.My suggestion would have been for them to film Heaton and Daniels while they seat on a couch and watch the original Goodbye Girl, it sure would have been more entertaining than what they came up with."
2,See the original movie instead,"I saw this in TV, it ia a pale imitation of the original. Jeff Daniels (usually a great actor) tries to do an imitation of Richard Dryfuss. Great script."
2,Disappointed in shirt quality,"The logo was fine, but the quality of the shirt was flimsy and the XL size was more like a large than extra large."
4,Great T-shirt,"I was real happy with this T-shirt, and the logo looks great... It was exactly what I thought it would be like. When it arrived I was delighted with it. It is a very good quality T-shirt too."
2,Blue tshirt with Navy SEAL logo,"I purchased this item to provide as a gift to a friend.When I received it, I noticed who thin the material was and really cheap.If your looking for a quality tshirt, don't buy this one."
4,Bravo!,"Being from a small town in Georgia myself, I completely bonded with the characters in both Mossy Creek books. These authors have done a wonderful job continuing these delightful stories and I look forward to reading more."
3,Reunion at Mossy Creek,"Reunion at Mossy CreekThe book concentrated around the question that burned Mossy Creek's old high school 20 years ago? And as they are planning how they are going to have a festival on Labor Day a large box is delivered to the group. What could this be? Can it be something that will hurt them? But they find out what it is and then decide what to do with it. The question unearthed secrets from the town's past.Some of the stories were really great like the love story between wallflowers Josie McClure. And ""bigfoot"", that she found on the mountain that she called her own. She found out who Bigfoot is and is not afraid of him. What could this be? While the first book was all touching and funny and a just a little bit sad, the second one had a lot of hurt people in itThis book was provided by BelleBooks free of charge and with no obligations to give a positive review."
5,All Parts Together by Tom Mach,"What I like best about historical fiction is the way author's put readers right smack in the action through the eyes of a fictional character, who seems to be a real person. Tom Mach accomplishes this goal."
1,Out of date and full of bad habits,"I was very disappointed in this book. While it may have been relevant when it was first published, the content has quickly become dated. Worse of all, there are a large number of suggested practices that are examples of poor management and leadership. This is not how you manage a game studio."
3,Careful on this one,"I ordered this book for a reading group for my fifth graders. I had a parent of one the students ""concerned"" about the ""spooky"" content that Sally Keehn put in this children's book, and I had to switch that child to a different group to accommodate. It is an enjoyable book to read if you stress that it is a fiction book."
1,Did not work,"I've used it for a month and have seen absolutely no change.It feels nice and fresh under my eyes, but that's just about it"
1,buy the complete seasone dvd's,this is nothin' compared 2 tha complete seasone dvd's. Theres only 4 episodes on this. I wouldnt buy this unless i did'nt have alot of money 2 spend>=(
3,Not the best South Park disc ever,"I hate to give this disc such an average rating, but I really didn't enjoy it all that much. I own the South Park movie and all 10 other South Park DVDs and I love them all. This one seems to fall a little short. The fact that Matt Stone and Trey Parker do not film a video intro for each episode definatly hurts. In my opinion, get it if your a South Park nut, or if you want to complete the collection. Besides, when you look at the big picture, four 22 minute episodes on a DVD is ridiculous, They could easily fit double that. There are episodes from Season 2 that still haven't made it to DVD, When are we going to get a full blown South Park DVD Collection?"
5,insults to injuries,I found southpark 'insult to injuries'amazing but quite offensive and funny at the same time. I would recamend it to big southpark fans and to people with a good sense of humour
1,COMES WITHOUT LOGIC BOARD CONNECTOR!,"Be aware that this battery DOES NOT HAVE A LOGIC BOARD CONNECTOR! It comes with bare wires (in fairness they do include shrink wrap on the wires), so if you do not have access to a connector (or a dead donor battery to take the connector from), then this battery is USELESS."
5,An excellent introduction to contemporary theory,"Despite the rather tongue-in-cheek review by the student from Boston, this is a well-edited and thoughtful collection. It provides context for selections from Marx, Saussure, Barthes, Foucault, Freud and others. As a professor who has taught widely about critical theory, I highly recommend this intelligent book."
4,The Gardens of Covington,"Although the reader knows that the ladies will survive every crisis, this book kept be reading until 4:00am in order to reach the conclusion."
4,Fun reading,I've read all of the Covington books--this one is a must do because it ties up lots of loose ends!
1,Roll About Stool,Could not find item number (bought through Taylor). Stool was awkward and did not function well on floor pictured. Good idea but needs work.
1,Bad idea,"This is a deceiving product. It looks great in the photo, but when you receive it, what a nightmare. I purchased it for my son who was recovering from leg surgery to help him be more independent. The first thing he said was this was definately not made with a man's anatomy in mind!. He could not tolerate sitting on the seat. It was too hard. the legs would not roll on our kitchen floor and it seemed unstable. This was a total waste of money. Buyer beware!."
3,U Broke My Wheel,"Mines came with a broken wheel and till this day I have not receive a replacement of the stool because the item has been on backorder since late december. Otherwise, it's good for now. I can still sit on and move around, but it's not ok to scratch up your floors with. Be careful buying this stool."
2,Tipsy stool does not roll well,"If you want a comfortable stool to sit on while working at the counter or stove, this stool is great. However, if you want to be able to sit and scoot around the kitchen, this is NOT the stool for you! The casters do not roll well, and the stool is easy to tip over, whether you are sitting on it or just scooting it by itself. It is high enough that a fall from it could cause serious injury. I would definitely NOT recommend this item for a handicapped person who is hoping to be able to get around the room more easily. It would have been a good product, if they had used good casters. Sometimes saving a dollar or two is not wise.Roll About Stool"
2,do not understand,The stool does allow me to work at the stove and kitchen counter more easily than standing but the seat is veryhard and uncomfortable and it is very difficult to roll. The coasters do not seem to want to move in any directionbut forward. I will be keeping the stool but really can not give it a very high recommendation.
1,DANGEROUS!,"I had one of these for a couple of days, and I swear it tried to kill me. It was difficult to sit down on (it tended to roll away). Once seated, I leaned forward ever so slightly and the darned thing toppled and nearly threw me. A horse is safer than this flimsy, three-legged thing. It's more rickety than I am."
1,Fall about stool?,"Needing a roll about stool to rest my legs and back when preparing salads and other fare for my 80 yr. old wife and me, I regretfully chose this item. It's one of the worst decisions I've ever made. It's poorly constructed with wobbly legs; the only swiveling occurs at the sometimes slow swiveling three casters. The saddle would wear out an elephant's posterior. It's easy enough to turn it over when going backwards but don't even think of going forwards across your kitchen unless you love hitting the floor. I returned mine to the assistive device company from whom I purchased it (not PPR). The authority of my assessment is forty years as a physical therapist. My advice: try an adjustable drafting stool."
1,Very unsafe,"After assembling this stool, the right wheel would not spin 360 degrees. The leg was slightly bent allowing it to spin about 90 degrees before it started scooting instead of rolling on the floor. My neighbor was able to bend the leg straight where the wheel spun much better.The most ""MAJOR"" problem with this stool is the possibility of it tipping over. It is extremely unstable while trying to turn left or right. You have to be able to grab the seat at the front between your legs and help the stool spin. If you don't you are sure to tilt and the wheels simply roll out from under you. You will come crashing down as I did twice before returning this stool to the seller.I will be buying a stool with 5 legs for stability."
1,Dangerous,"I was loaned one of these after I had ankle surgery. It is very unstable under the best of circumstances. The wheels are of cheap, low-quality plastic, and they tend to stick, instead of rolling smoothly. When that happens, your natural inclination is to push through the resistance, but then the stool tips over. Sometimes, if you just shift your weight, the stool will tip when you are sitting on it in one place. Someone could get hurt on this. The concept has potential, but the execution is very poor. If I could give it zero stars, I would. I don't even think Amazon should sell this. It might make a great product with more legs for stability and high-quality, ball-bearing wheels."
3,roll about stool,This product is generally good but not so good for short people. My feet could'nt reach the floor even when set to the lowest level.
1,Ithoughts,I bought this stool 6 months ago. The casters did not roll well at all. Then the seat broke off. It is a piece of garbage. Do not buy it.
3,difficult to assemble,This is the 2nd rollabout stool I have had. The replacement was because a caster had broken off and could not be reattached. Hence the purchase of a new stool. This new one was very difficult to assemble because of the bolts could not be tightened as easily as the 1st stool. Also the seat attchment was as difficult.
2,Roll About only rolls backwards,"I am not secure on the stool. Even at its lowest level it's too high for me; have to get on toes to sit. It is very unstable, and has tilted over causing me to fall. I have a gash on my leg trying to prevent falling. Can only maneuver stool to roll backwards; will not go side to side, nor forward; certainly doesn't ""roll about"".(Roll About Stool) Threw out carton or would return it!"
1,Disappointed,"the seat is incredibly hard and uncomfortabledoes NOT roll well at allwould NOT recommendIt's a clever idea, perhaps the manufacturer should have put better quality wheels and seat and charged more money for it."
1,Roll About Stool,"ROLL ABOUT STOOLBefore I ordered this stool, I read two positive and one negative reviews. I should have paid more attention to the negative review. It stated the wheels didn't roll well. Absolutely true! They barely roll at all!"
1,Roll About Stool,"One star is too high a rating for this stool. I took it out of the box, carefully assembled it and within fifteen minutes of use one of the wheels broke off. It did not roll about very easily like some stools I have seen. The seat is slightly tilted upward making for an uncomfortable time with the narrow part of the seat pressing on one's ""delicate"" parts. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It is flimsy and dangerous. I could have been badly hurt when the wheel broke off. I would return it but the effort to take it apart, put it in a box, drive forty miles to a UPS store is more than I can deal with. It went into the trash heap. One more disappointing piece of junk from China!"
1,Will this work in your work area?,"I really could have used something like this, as I have several health issues, and LOVE cooking. I thought this product was truly the answer for the ""resting"" periods I had to take during prepping and making dinners.I was wrong. My husband assembled it with ease, and we adjusted it to my height. But as soon as I tried to roll on our hardwood floors, it immediately marred them.The wheels just aren't correct, or constructed well.I've returned to product, and am awaiting credit.(P.S. It needed to be returned via U.S. Postal Service (over $13.00), rather than by UPS Ground.)"
2,pretty cheap,"I would not recommend this stool for any persons of size (I am 5'3"" and 280lbs) as it just doesn't roll well under any circumstances; especially when I adjust the stool to height for washing dishes I can't roll on it at all, so the wheels are actually pretty useless. The seat is hard and uncomfortable. I found getting the nuts to tighten without tools was quite a task (I actually did resort to a pliers on the seat-nuts; the leg nuts would have required two tools,) and there were no wrenches in the kit. If you've seen similar seats for a lot more and you're asking why this one is so inexpensive, remember that you get what you pay for."
4,Very enjoyable!,"I just saw this show last night in Fort Myers, FL. It was really good. The cast did an excellent job of singing these great tunes and there was a simple storyline to follow among the characters. It IS a simple show...taking place in a recording studio. So not a lot of glitz and glamour. But I would definately go see this again...and would see it before seeing some of the ""hits"" that I have seen. If you are considering to buy this CD....get it. It's fast and slow and fast again...and leaves you feeling....good."
3,Entertaining,"Interesting medleys, with mostly a swing beat. Some of them make me think of the old Lawrence Welk Show, (I know that isn't a very flattering description, but it's family oriented and usually in chorus). To me the best part is that many of the performers are better than the original animated voices."
5,A Must-Have!!!!,"As a long-time Disney and Broadway lover, it is absolutely the perfect product for me. The way that one song flows into another is gorgeous and they way they combine songs in some tracks is flawless. I would never have thought to combine some of the songs, but it works so well. The vocals in a couple songs leave a little to be desired but Reflection and A Change In Me more than make up for that. I've been listening to this over and over since I got it and I can't get enough of it!!"
5,Oh how wonderful this is!,"Are you a huge Disney fan like me? If yes, then you should consider buying this cd. I have listened to it more times than I care to count. It's basically a huge medley of all Disney's most popular tunes, but it's even more than a simple medley. The songs have been rearranged to be beautiful duets, trios, or quartets with amazing harmony lines that are simply mouthwatering. And the singers are fantastic with classic Disney/musical voices. Oh how I love this cd, it's a permanent resident in my car's cd player and I can recommend it to anybody who loves Disney and loves harmonies."
1,A bit disappointing,"I originally bought this to be a unit project for my middle-school son and I to put together...little did I know that this book could confuse most adults for months to come. The instructions were confusing, the methods very complicated, and the end result looked nothing like the pictures.I'm no origami expert, but I've always been able to get my projects to look very similar to the model in the book...this one was more of a practice session with frustration and disappointment."
2,"Rather short, weak entries","This book is not bad on amount of entries but lacks any sort of depth, most definitions and descriptions are short and barely informative. It seems that this author decided not to do any substantial research or make the effort required, has a cut and paste feel."
2,"thickening, no, greasy, yes","I got this product as I was told it was a good product for thinning hair to help it look thicker. I didn't notice any changes after my first few uses but figured to give it some time. After a couple of weeks, I found it to be inferior to the prior products I have been using regarding hair thickening. It also makes my hair very greasy, such that if I touch my hair throughout the day I must wash my hands to get the greasy feeling off. It also led to some breakouts of my forehead around my hairline, which other products have not done. Doesn't get my vote at all."
4,"Life in a small town in Minnesota, eh!","This book is an interesting read! It begins with murders of young female students in a high school in a small town but drifts into a narrative of the life of one of the teachers during this period, as written in his journal. I enjoyed it; but then I enjoyed his other books! Warning, it is not a ""who done it"" or detective novel."
4,The ending took a star off my rating,"IN A DARK TIME is a thoughtful, very well written short novel. The time frame of the novel is specifically the spring of 1973 and the setting is a small Minnesota city where three tragic unsolved murders have taken place at the local high school. The narrator and his friends and colleagues at the high school are well realized as is the rest of the small Midwestern community. I am glad Watson provides a solution to the crimes though the ending is somehow not up to the standards of the rest of the book. Yet I am very glad I discovered the excellent writing of Larry Watson and plan to read more of his work."
4,Exceptionally clear and enlightening,"Quantum computing is one of those things that is almost impossible to explain to someone who doesn't already have a good understanding of both quantum physics and computational theory- and yet Johnson manages to present a beautiful, elegant explanation without resorting to the typical hand-waving and metaphor that characterizes most popular books on modern physics. He explains, in clear and precise language, (1) why it is that quantum uncertainty makes powerful computing possible; (2) the nature of computationally difficult problems (i.e., those solvable in exponential time and those that are not NP-complete) (3) the physics involved in the physical realization of quantum computing, and (4) Shor's algorithm and other algorithms used in quantum computing. A beautiful, precise, and fascinating book."
5,"Very Powerful, Very Profound","I say this is the most powerful poetry I have read in my life. I cannot read it for more than a few minutes. The poetic images are so intense, the emotions are so powerful. I love this book."
2,Good instruction - poor organization,"Examples are easy to follow. The first chapters are almost spoon-fed. However organization is whack. The book is designed to be used from cover to cover - no skipping chapters. The index is horrible. In most texts, topics are arranged by chapter in the CONTENTS section and all topics are arranged by alpha order in the INDEX. In this book, it's inconvenient to lookup ""model editing"" for example. One has to look in each chapter to find which takes a lot more time than scanning an alphabetical listing."
3,Early effort,A talented author takes a look at a homicide detective. Interesting but lacks real movement. The author improves greatly in later efforts.
5,SaDdLe cLuB all the way!!!,"THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!!! You just got to love it. If you like horses and if you like to laugh, this is your movie! Many of the actors have Australian accents and the movie is corny at times, but it is great like the books. EVEN BETTER! It will make you wish you were part of the Saddle Club. The first day we got it, we watched it over and over. Atleast 3 times! Its one of those kind of movies that you watch over and over until you memorize all the lines!""I never want to see a stunt like that again Veronica!I didn't mean to approach so fast Max.It's a miracle you didn't break your neck or Cobalt's!""OR""When I was 5 I wanted to be a cat!""This movie is truely the best. Check out the SC website, http://www.saddleclubtv.com for more SC fun and music!Hello World, This is Me, Life Should Be, MMM MMM YEAH, Fun For Everyone!YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE! IT'S SOOOOOO AMAZING!"
3,fun to watch but not so great,"I don't think any of you reviewers have seen the Saddle Club episodes on TV. I wouldn't blame you because you'd have to have digital cable. Anyway, they chose the sad episodes to put in the video, not the good ones. It's still a good movie. I mean, how often would you find a horse movie? I've seen it so many times."
2,Not so great...,"Personally, I really really don't like this movie. It's basically taking bits and pieces of various episodes of the TV show, putting them together and selling it as a movie. It strays far from the books and their acting isn't very good, neither is the riding. It's nice to see a horse movie, and I suppose the special features are TOO terrible, but overall it is not my cup of tea. I suppose younger kids who have never seen the TV series would like it, but I'm not one of them."
5,"Yeah, it continues!","Perhaps this video is why there is not a book 102 out? Maybe they just had to take some time off to do this project? Anyways, I hope it covers books 1, 2, and 3. I am probably going to die when Cobalt dies! I am planning on buying this video as soon as it comes out! What a great week next week would be! It would be even better if my baseball team wins Monday (local Pioneer League Baseball starts Monday!), buy this video Tuesday, and hopefully quit work and buy a pool table! Then I can have a party with some friends over to watch this video and play pool! I can't wait!"
3,Not yet..,"While I haven't had the change to watch the video yet, I fully plan to as soon as it comes out. I work at a video store, so I get to see it in advance. But for any young horse lover, this is a great book series. It was my favorite as a young girl. I can only hope that the movie is as good as the books. I followed the adventures of Stevie, Carol and Lisa throught my childhood and it's great to see them make the book into a movie. While they can't incorporate all the adventures into one 85 minute movie, I hope they are able to put a majority of them in without overdoing it."
3,Slow Delivery,Slow delivery. Ordered 9/11 and given delivery window of 9/17 - 10/4. It didn't arrive until after that date. The video was fine.
2,Saddle Club game,We had trouble loading this game to the computer. Once loaded it was not what was expected. I would not buy this again. Check reviews before you buy. I bought this for a 10 year old and this game would not keep her interest. She loves horses so I thought this would be good challengeDon't waste your money
5,Horse crazy! BUY THIS VIDEO IF YOU HAVE A CASE OF HORSECRAZ,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I DONT OWN IT BUT I LOOOVE IT!I AM A ENGLISH HORSE-BACK RIDER AND I AM CRAZY ABOUT HORSES/PONIES/ AND MINIATURE HORSES!i OWN SOME OF THE SADDLE CLUB BOOKS [ SOMEWHERE!]I FEEL LIKE CAROLE HANSON IN THE SADDLE CLUB MOVIE.IT WAS SOOOOO COOL WHEN SAMSON , THE FOAL WAS BORN.I LIKE THE CHARACTARS. iKINDA FELT LIKE IN REAL LIKE THAT iHAD TROUBLE WITH A GIRL LIKE VERONICA D'ANGELO.BUY THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE A CASE OF HORSE CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SEE MY REVIEWS OF THE LITTLE MERMAID TWO, AMERICAN GIRL MAGAZINE< AND THE CARE AND KEEPING OF YOU!P.S.S. THE SADDLE CLUB C-d rom I heard the chareactars still speak australian and sometimes you cannot understand them.A girl at my camp owned the cd.I think I heard that The show is on 2am and 9pm [eastern] and about the movie: THE FEEL LIKE YOUR HORSECRAZY FRIENDS> THE DVD HAS COOL EXTRAS< I SAW AT MY GRANDPA""s!enjoy this movie and the books~! =^..^=thAT'S mY ADVICe!RB"
3,Well...,Overall I liked the movie... it was great to finally see the book series come to life...but... I thought the movie lacked so much and tended to stray FAR away from the books at some points. I myself prefer the books. But overall... a pretty good movie for any horse lover.
4,The Saddle Club,"...I doubt that the movie was made from the tv show, It was most likely taken from the books.I thought the movie was pretty good. I liked how it talked about some of the things girls go through at that age. It was enjoyable."
2,"For my purposes, disappointing","While not necessarily a bad book, this selection just doesn't do what I need. I was looking for something to help me make a purchase from a tech persepective (e.g., where should I look for rust). What I got is ""This is the Jeep you should buy to make an investment and sell it for a lot of money."""
3,"Since Murder City broke up, someone has to do it . . .","For those mourning the demise of Seattle&#65533;s Murder City Devils, cheer up. There is hope as long as bands like Your Enemies Friends are around. On their debut EP, the band tears through six songs in classic Murder City fashion, with dark lyrics on par with those of The Faint or Alkaline Trio. The out-of-control keyboard parts paired up with the guy/girl vocals answers the question: &#65533;what would The Anniversary sound like if they decided to rock out?&#65533; In the end, the 22 minute EP leaves you wanting more. If having played &#65533;This Ain&#65533;t No Picnic&#65533; (the seminal indie-rock festival that spawned the likes of At The Drive-In and Pinback) is any indication, Your Enemies Friends are worth separating from the myriad other rock bands and adding to your record collection.You might like this record if you like: Pretty Girls Make Graves, The Faint, Dead Low Tide"
4,Just Wait...,"Yes this EP is killer, but it just gives us a taste of what's to come. The amazing thing is that these kids were like 20 when they wrote this mature, musically advanced album. Look for the new full length (out now or soon?)."
3,At The Drive-In anybody?,"I listened to Your Enemies Friends expecting something original, as they are on Buddyhead's record label, but I was sadly mistaken. While there are some original aspects to YEF's music, they are just another rehash of At The Drive-In. Does Buddyhead have some kind of infatuation with At The Drive-In? Radio Vago sounds like them too, only the usage of a synth (?) is incorporated into the music.Don't get me wrong. This is good music, just don't expect anything totally original or revolutionizing."
2,Used copy of The Beast of Monsieur Racine,"This book was not in the condition in which it was described and, in fact, was in such bad condition that I returned it. It was most disappointing and I will probably not order from this company again."
1,A grooming manual,"The graphics in this book are blatantly sexual; the beast's nose cannot be perceived to be anything other than the representation of a penis. The moral of the story is that if you make friend's with the beast you will get lots of cookies and icecream; if you tell anyone the whole world will find out and the police will be called and there'll be such pandemonium.....and everyone will see it was the children's own doing. Tut tut.How in the world can such a work pass for suitable children's literature, when the possibility of it being used as a grooming manual are so blatantly apparent....I have never recommended a book-burning, but I can see where it can come in useful."
5,Super Summer Shorts,"These are long wearing, rugged shorts. I had to buy one size smaller than I normally wear to get them to fit right.June 2009 Update: The review above reflects three pair of shorts I purchased from 2006-2008. I've worn these for years and liked their heavy duty fabrics and long lasting wear for outdoor activities. The latest pair I purchased in June 2009, clearly use cheaper, thinner, fabrics. While they still fit well (one size smaller still fits better), thinner fabrics and a little cheaper workmanship makes them average now. I will continue to purchase because I like their shorter inseem and fit."
3,funny shorts,"These shorts are pretty funny. The blue jean kinda color is awesome. They look like what a 12 yr old wears back in 1985. That said it's kinda tough for me to wear them in public, but they are great for around the house."
2,Very cheaply made light bulbs,"I can't really complain due to the low price, but these light bulbs were obviously very cheaply manufactured. They do not last very long either.In hindsight, I should have purchased CFLs."
5,Cute story! Kept me on my toes!,"When a new Nancy Stern moves into an apartment building, the old Nancy Stern starts receiving her mail. Nancy and Nancy meet and realize that they are as different as can be.The old Nancy Stern is a preschool teacher who is looking for love. Eventually she finds it, but only accidentally. And only due to being the wrong Nancy! From there the story takes many twists and turns and just when you think you've got it figured out -- you don't!I really enjoyed the fun story line and thought the characters were unique. This was the first time I'd read anything by Heller and I'm sure I'm come back for more of her soon!"
4,A Good Evening's Entertainment,"I don't look to Jane Heller for a great reading experience but I do look to her for a night's light, comic entertainment and she always delivers. This newest novel is no exception. I can blast right through one of her books because they are easy and fun. This has a nice fantasy aspect too where the heroine tries on someone else's more glamorous life to meet her man."
3,Good for a quick read to kill time waiting at the doctors,"This story is more or less cliche with the expected plots, I have found little ""depth"" to this book: little ugly duckling find prince-charming. After trying to fight crime with her beau, she regain her self-esteem and find herself not so 'ordinary' afterall. However, I do enjoy the writer's sense of humour. Her ""poignant"" descriptions with American culture stereotyping makes it easy for readers to visual her writings. The book is targeted for the lazy readers and with little room for one's imagination (supposingly the juicy enjoyment of reading). Read this book when you are bored to death and would want anything that does not require much attention to kill time with."
4,Must have been the suspense that kept me reading!!!!,"""Name Dropping"" was good. Nancy Stern and her nemesis Nancy Stern both live in the same building. A surprise Christmas gift sends the unpopular Nancy Stern into a threatening situation. Her boyfriend is hiding a secret job and the other Nancy Stern is killed. This book is not your typical fiction and I do believe that is what kept me so interested."
2,Not My Cup Of Tea,"Jane Heller's ""Name Dropping"" really missed the mark. I found the storyline new and different at first glance but, was really saddened about a third of the way in. I was bored and not interested in anything about the story. I thought it all a bit over-dramatic and made-up. Just not my idea of a good read. I found it greatly lacking."
1,I Had Hoped for Better,"This book was billed as being a good read for people who like Susan Isaacas. Not even close. I found this book to be both slow and obvious, not intriguing in the least. I finished it to find out ""whodunnit"" and was exteremely disappointed in how that was revealed. Jane Heller took a fundamentally good idea for a story and wrote it very poorly."
1,Major waste of time,"If only I'd listened to Sharon and Martina, I wouldn't have wasted my beach time on this one. The characters are thin and the plot coincidences unbelievable. This shouldn't have passed Fiction 101."
3,5 stars? Give me a break!,"I purchased this book because of the good ratings it received here at Amazon from editorial and fan reviews. I also thought the premise of the book would make it a fun and interesting read. But I was duped! I found the writing to be amateurish and boring. I did manage to finish it, it was a quick read but I would only recommend this book if you can get it at the library or wait until it comes out in paperback. Buyer beware and take those 5 star reviews with a grain of salt."
4,A Quick Read That's Pure Fun!!,"Read this in one day, you won't want to put it down either. Characters and storyline that aren't brain surgery but so much fun!! An extra kick for New Yorkers who know all the references and know how mix-ups can happen in doorman buildings. A great summer read and especially recomended for making travel time go by in a snap."
4,Like a fun Roller Coaster Ride!,"I actually enjoyed this book a lot more then I thought I would!""Name Dropping"" is about Nancy Stern, a Pre-school teacher who spends her days with 4-year olds and her Saturday nights at home. Along comes a new tenant in her building that is blond, leggy, silicon filled AND interviews celebrities for a magazine. Oh, and her name? Nancy Stern!Pre-school Nancy is suddenly deluged with phone calls, flowers and mail for Glamorous Nancy. Just when she thinks it's all too much to bear along comes Bill Harris, an eligible bachelor who was calling for the other Nancy but Pre-school Nancy decides to go on the date instead and so begins the roller coaster ride of this book.Lots of twists and turns. Perfect book to take to the beach. A light, fun read!"
3,Name Dropping,"This is a ""cute book,"" with an adorable heroine, nice guy hero and many, many coincidences in the plot. It's not nearly as good as one of Susan Isaacs' books,which are frothy but intelligent. If you want to read something that's non-demanding but a bit more substantial than a Harlequin romance, this book is ideal. I was sorry I paid for the hardback."
4,Great Start! kind of loss me on the Finish though,"Well I loved this book from the beginning it seemed like I was in for a Terrific Read and then it started to (in my impression) take up unnessecary pages. I can't spoil it for some readers but it does get to a point where you don't understand why ""Bill"" is being so evasive and then you all of sudden get the excuse for it and it is like watching a bad Soap Opera, I could have called that one a mile away. I just wish that some time they (authors, directors) would throw a twist at you that you didn't see coming but makes Perfect, Credible sense. Overall it was a Fast read and I would recommend it to others especially if you are looking for a nice ""light, quick and funny"" read."
5,Jane is TOPS!,I enjoyed Name Dropping so much that I hated for it to end (in less than 24 hours). Ms. Heller's books generally affect me that way. She's a wonderful writer and keeps me waiting for more. I've been hooked on Ms. Heller since I read her book The Club a few years ago. After reading The Club I went out and purchased every book of hers that I could find. For me she became one of those authors who I would purchase on faith alone. I think you will enjoy this book so go out and get it.
3,Solid album,"Auberge perfectly embodies the spirit of Chris Rea: the deep, gruff voice, the backwater blues guitar fusing with trumpet and strings and, of course, those lyrics. Now and then he breaks away from his own brand of twangy blues to Dire Straits-type ballads. Songs to lend an ear to are the title track, You're Not A Number and Set Me Free. The whole album, though, is worth a good listen."
5,Very amazed...........,FOOL IF YOU THINK IT'S OVER....You'll want to collect all his Albums/cd's....That's what I did...in the 70's...Ihad What ever happened to benny Santini..LP....I now have it on cd...Awesome....just like me you'll want to collect them all...RDC/KC'
4,Auberge,Chris Rea is a brilliant artist who is just as much at home writing fine music as he is playing it. He is not afraid to try different things. Some of these work and some don't. Most of the variations to the norm that are provided on this album work very very well. It is a journey of types from sweet joyful tracks to more rocky numbers. Give it a listen.
2,Most unromantic Tristan you hope never to see!,"I bot this disc because I liked the tenor at the Met Live in HD at the cinema. While the conducting and singing are pretty good, the production has zero sex appeal and completely counters Wagner's music. In short I hated it. The Isolde is also a little lightweight vocally, although she wisely seldom pushes her voice beyond what it can do. Same goes for Robert Dean Smith, the Tristan. I'm told he was underpowered at the Met, which of course did not reveal itself in the telecast where tHe voice had to be miked.The BD is fine technically, both for video and sound."
5,Awesome collectible,Great stories and awesome edition. Neat layout of 221B Baker Street on the inside of each of the covers.
2,Did not work for us,"Our dog avoided eating his food after sprinkling For-Bid on it, so I can't say if it would work or not."
4,great creative CD!! i like!,"i just wanna say that i like this album a lot... tell me how many jazz singers these days write their own songs instead of singging old cover songs.jamie is creative in this CD although is not as good or as jazzy as the previous CD but i still like this CD a lot. although it took me awhile to really feel his music in this CD.esp: Fascinating rhythm, he features his famous ""tapping piano"" as he did in all his live shows.. (my friend told me whoever bought his second hand piano is surely getting a damaged one) glad that he put it in this album.. mind trick, photography, catch the sun are really good songs too."
5,Jamie Rocks the House!,"Jamie is an incredible artist! I first heard about him promoting ""Twentysomething"" on NPR and am now hooked. After seeing him live at Chastain Park in Atlanta, there's no other word for him than BRILLIANT! The album is fantastic and definitely worth the $$$."
3,Disappointed,"I bought the CD having heard Cullum's rendition of ""I only have eyes for you"" on the radio. It is truly brilliant and easily the best interpretation of this song that I've ever heard. Unfortunately, most of the other songs on the album are quite mediocre and embarrasingly juvenile. Jamie has a great interpretive talent and a great voice but I think he should fight the urge to write his own songs."
5,Great music,"I hope this guy has a long career in music.I wish Amazon would start packaging as the previously did, just last year. I had to order this and seveal other things twice just to get an undamaged copy. PLEASE aamazon return to the days when you cared about items arriving undamaged."
3,Not quite Twentysomething,"To me this is quite a departure from ""Vocal Jazz"". I really love Jamie's voice but not so much on this more ""Tech Pop"" sounding CD. On Twentysomething he really sounded like he could do anything he wanted, his range seemed quite large. On this CD though he seems a little more stuck in the middle to me. Also, many of the songs on this CD just don't have much of a hook to them like say ""All At See"" or ""These Are The Days"". But even having said all of that I think this artist is growing and is still finding himself. All in all this CD is pretty good. It's just not the 5 star product that Twentysomething is."
2,A big disapointment,"I waited impatiently for Jamie's second album, but, unfortunately, it seems that he has lost much of the magic that made his first album a masterpiece. I believe most of us liked him because of his wonderful voice and his talent to sing and play jazzy tunes. This second album is rather a mixture of pop and easy listening songs that anyone could have sung. Frankly, this is not was I expected, it has been a big disappointment."
2,What a let down,"I'm a huge fan of Cullum's first album Twentysomething. So when I finally got this one from Amazon, I was so excited. But an hour later, I was sitting there like, uhmmmmm, well....... Since then, I listened to it several times again hoping it might grow on me. Unfortunately, it is not the case. To me, this album feels more like those gazillions of rock/pop staff out there which I'm not quite interested. Only Photograph is mildly intereeting."
2,What happened?,"After two fabulous contemporary ""old school"" jazz albums which I would recommend to anyone (Pointless Nostalgic and Twentysomething), this album is more like some sort of bad half-breed between ""old school"" jazz and pop. And not that a cross between jazz and pop couldn't be good music, but this one just really isn't. It seems that he is trying to transition between musical genres, and is falling flat on his face in the process. I have listened to it again and again trying to make myself like it, but it just isn't happening. Save a few tracks, the songs on this album are rather uninspired and dull, and I fear that these days Jamie Cullum really does ""Want To Be A Popstar""..."
3,When he's good ...,"After hearing a couple of cuts on the radio, I was sure I'd like ""Catching Tales."" Perhaps it's his youth, but it seems Callum is still searching for his voice, making this CD very uneven. The first few cuts here are somewhat mediocre pop. Then comes the best version of ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" that I've ever heard--a mix of jazz and R&B and arranged with real originality. One can say that the the rest of the songs on ""Catching Tales"" are certainly better than average, as is the singing; Callum has good timing and knows how to swing. It seems to me that Jamie Callum is a singer worth waiting for as he matures into a unique performer."
4,Another Cullum Success,"If you like Jamie Cullum's ""Twenty Something"", you'll like this one too. Maybe not as much- if you love his piano, as I do. But it's still very enjoyable."
1,He should be prohibited -by law- from singing.,"This guy stinks in a serious way. His voice is absolutely horrible, he cannot sing at all. He's twenty something years old and tries to sing some old classics, it is pathetic."
1,This music is everything you want except Jazz,"I am not going to write just a book about what is Jazz or not,it can be almost everything, but this record is so far away of a more or less good Jazz, I accept that for many persons it's a good cd and even good music, but if you want to try with Jazz, just go for the Miles Davis's Plugged Nickel,Lee Morgan""Sidewinder"",Coltrane""A love Supreme"",ant there are thousands of Jazz musicians that will make you forget Cullum, Abdullah Ibrahim,Tomasz Stanko,Albert Ayler,Monk,Bill Evans the pianist,Archie Shepp,Sonny Rollins, you would have to give them a chance just to taste a real Jazz sound"
3,Disappointed,The book was so-so. I was disappointed that it told me absolutely nothing about Dennis Rader as a person. There was nothing in the book about his background from childhood and nothing about his marriage and relationship with his wife. I'm glad I didn't spend a lot of money for the book.
1,THE BTK MURDERS,"I eagerly awaited thia book and what a dissapointment it is. Obviously it was written for those who know little or nothing abt the case, but want to read a true crime book on the throne or on the subway. There was no new data and the descriptions of the crimes were like reading fiction, especially since the author obviously did not check the details, even though they are on the internet. At one point he says that after the first crimes, Rader went home to his wife and kids, when at that time he had no kids. There are countless others, but out of respect for those involved, I will not specify. Was not worth the wait or the money."
5,BTK,"I lived in the area these murders took place and still have a home in Wichita. It is very interesting to me to learn more about the murders and the investigation. I also had friends on the police department that were very involved, but could not know this at the time."
2,Thumbs Down,"Don't be fooled by the rapturous reviews on the back cover: It ain't all that.There IS a promising murder mystery here. But the plot is so convoluted that slogging your way through the mire is hardly worth it. The main characters, without exception, range from distasteful to downright despicable. There is no one to cheer for here.Last words: Too much work for too little reward."
4,Interesting book!,"When I reviewed the title and people who had read it I prepared myself for the worst. Instead I found a very nice book. It was not boring, there are many subplots, and the main one is very easy to solve. The question is WHY! And he delivers. It seemed more like the author was trying to self-examine thru the main character.Everything is kind of introvertive, every story.Because of his reasoning, some people will find it amusing, some other boring.The environment is well developed, and every detail counts. Also the stories continually interrelate with each other, and that is why some people thought it complicated to understand.I personally liked it, and left me thinking... of course is me. To give you an idea, I enjoy Arturo Perez-Reverte, good history books, and the REAL Sherlock among others."
1,Yuck!,"This book was so horrid that I can't recommend it to anyone, nor even in good conscience give it away. Not gothic, mysterious, or even interesting. It would have put me to sleep if I hadn't been so frustrated by it's lameness. I feel especially bad for the people who paid for the hard copy!"
2,Better than Nyquil,"I agree completely with the reviewer below. Antiseptic, lifeless, soggy. The mystery isn't as clever as the professional reviews would have you believe. The characters are far more dull than they would have you believe. Even more overrated than INSTANCE OF THE FINGERPOST, if that's possible."
4,A superior echo of the 1860s sensation novel,"Palliser has been described as ""the best Victorian writer working today,"" but that wans't really true until the publication of THE UNBURIED. His previous major foray into Victorian fiction, THE QUINCUNX, was all virtuoso plot twists and sudden character reversals with no one to care about and an unbelievable Jamesian ending of renunciation.But, in the ten years intervening between that novel and THE UNBURIED, Palliser seems to have learned a great deal. His newest novel is much briefer and much more engaging. It does require from its readers a great deal of prior knowledge regarding the seventeenth-century English civil wars and the hierarchy of the Anglican church, but it's still a great read, with a terrific sense of physical atmosphere and interesting characters. Some of the plot twists are telegraphed a little too clearly ahead of time, but for the most part this adds to0 the book's enjoyment rather than detracts from it."
2,Disappointing and over-rated,"I'm surprised this book is compared by the publisher to sublime THE NAME OF THE ROSE and THE MONK. It's really quite thin gruel, packaged as something substantial.Despite the references to fog and dark corners and such, the Gothic atmosphere was barely present, and while the multi-layered plot is quite ingenious, the clues are so incredibly obvious in a few places (if you've read more than a handful of mysteries), I felt embarrassed."
4,A brillliant murder-mystery,"Dr Courtine is an investigative historian taking advantage of a little spare time before Christmas to study his favourite subject, Alfred the Great. Instead of a little quiet solitude, Dr. Courtine becomes involved in an investigation of a disappearance two hundred years ago, uncovers lies and deceit with regards to his manuscript and becomes embroiled in a murder investigation. Throw in the ghost and a shifty former best friend, and all Palliser's ingredients are in place. Written through accounts as opposed to narrative, along the same lines as Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", The Unburied is a compelling piece of historical fiction that evokes the Victorian period vividly. The setting, characters and most of all the strong plot which maintains intrigue throughout, result in a fantastic read. This is the first Palliser novel I have read, I do not intend to stop there."
2,A Good Short Story Masquerading as a Novel,"If you're looking for a new take on the Victorian Christmas ghost story (as this novel claims to be), well, this may not be the book for you. Palliser takes his time setting up this tale, in which the ghosts are more figurative than anything else. The first 200 pages or so are filled with plot lines that seem to go nowhere and tales that have you moving from the 9th to the 17th to the 19th centuries. Quite confusing, and, frankly, rather dull. Had this been a short story, it would be quite good, but as a nearly 400 page novel it is simply tedious."
2,"Unless you are a devoted fan, probably not worth the time.","I actually loved the first section of the book, when there was the promise of something significant going on. Unfortunately, nothing is... not really. There are a ton of books in this genre that top this effort, though I will say that Palliser's word-craft is far above the norm of ""pulp fiction"". That aside, the plot has alot of promise, which makes its eventual and questionable resolution all the more painful."
4,To finish - or not to finish?,"Aleksandra's first sentence is correct; I'd completely concur with her adjective ""curious."" Her review is dead on.It is incredibly slow - and confusing - in the beginning. I kept on going because of the parallel to Wilkie Collins in the jacket blurb. I remember when the book got hold of me - page 151, and I was surprised I'd held on that long. But when it caught me, it caught me, and I had difficulty putting it down.There is a huge amount of set up, mostly consisting of lengthy conversation between Courtine and Fickling. I didn't really absorb a lot of it, consequently, when the book finally captured my attention, I had to go back and review everything so I knew what the heck was going on.The afterward helped to finalize everything, and then, like Aleksandra, I reread the forward.I was glad I finished it, but I probably wouldn't read it again."
4,A thinking person's book,"This book was very good, possibly excellent. The pace was good & steady. It was suspenseful but not a heart pounder or nail biter. No unnecesary chase or sex scenes. The characters were beleivable and complex. The ending wraps up but everything is not tied up in neat little bows. It is certainly not a ""cookie cutter"" popular mystery. That could be the reason some people were dissapointed. I enjoyed it."
2,Sorely Dissappointed,"As a major fan of the Quincunx I anxiously awaited this release. Unfortunately it had none of the appeal of the earlier book. The plot was convoluted, and frequently difficult to follow. This is particularly the case due to all the characters involved and the circular nature of the plot. While it is well written, and had times had great ambiance, it's hard to recommend this dissappointing effort."
2,wordy and tiresome,"i really wanted to enjoy this book...it was foggy outside, and i was curled up in bed. i typically enjoy gothic, chilling tales and was eagerly anticipating this read. i have to say, much to my chagrin, that this novel was a sore disappointment. while the storyline is complex and developed, it is tiresome and difficult to understand. many obscure references are often interjected which leaves the reader confused and off-track. there is simply TOO much going on in the plot, and there is not enough actually occurring to off-set all the wordy dialogue. in other words, it ends up reading like one longwinded tale in which very little happens. it verbose to a fault and does not employ any stategies of keeping a person entertained. it felt like work. sorry, palliser!"
3,More Mentally Than Physically Haunting,"I think it must be a keystone of the genre of Victorian fiction for it to be slow-moving. Despite the snail's pacing, it is an interesting and well-written novel. My biggest issue with it lies with its rather annoyingly repetitive style - the same three stories are retold over and over again, each time with a new possible solution, but with none of the set-up presented any differently! So, while it is interesting overall, it is just not terribly engrossing. It's too easy to put the book aside, and it keeps dragging on and on in what feels like circles at times. The ending, at least, ties together most of the loose threads in an original and satisfying way, which is really the salvation of the entire book. Still, the pace of the book is its main downfall. Although, the structure feels original and the way it all works out was pretty surprising. It really isn't a hatable book, but it isn't really a lovable one either."
2,Too disjointed for my taste...,"The plot of The Unburied intrigued me so much that I started reading this book as soon as I bought it. At first, I thought the writing was quite imaginative. Charles Palliser has a rather vivid and compelling imagination. But as I continued to read I noticed that this novel lacked plot and characterization. There are so many dead ends and unimportant pieces of information that I felt lost. I don't always have problems with miscellaneous information, but it appears that the clues and so-called twists were thrown in for no reason other that to lengthen the book. At the end, I ended up closing the book with the intention of never opening it again. The writing is too disjointed to be enjoyed. Disappointing..."
4,Superb,"Readers of ""The Quincunx"" will not be dissapointed in this splendid novel. Though it uses a smaller canvas than Palliser's first novel, that canvas is very finely worked, rather like the difference between Dickens and Austen. I appreciate a book that makes me work. By the way, admirers of ""The Unburied"" might also enjoy Pears's ""An Instance of the Fingerpost,"" which employs a similar plot device."
3,Wasted Potential,"This book had the potential to be a turning point in the careers of many in the field. However, the choppyness of the ideas through the text, quickly became boring and repetitive. I would have liked to see a more organized lay out to process.For example: The chapter on prospecting is in the middle, but the book ends with how to sell yourself to a prospect. they should have been together.Maybe their will be a better follow up.I completely agree with the concept and the process. I think it is the only way to successfully have a great business, but the book could have been so much more.If you are in Financial Services, you should get this book. You will have to do what I've done and take the ideas and lay them out to your liking."
1,Would have given zero stars 00000,"This book is a bunch of old hash. Has this advisor really done what he has written. If he is talking with only people who can give him $25,000 annually in fees or commissions, wouldn't you think his average account size is $2.5 at 1% ROA. So only 40 accounts to do a million. He stated in am email ""When we are in a building mode, we are seeing as many as 40-60 new prospects every month, face to face. That is almost 3 appointments a day. When do you have time to call. I asked him a question via email about a script to use and received the following:...""We call them on the phone, identify ourselves, and ask them if they would have a half hour to meet with us in the next week or so. this makes them usually ask us why. So we tell them."" I ask is this advice worth the asking price with a follow-up book on prospecting. I think NOT."
2,Not Avi's Best,"Boring and easy to figure out this was not one of Avi's best. If you're looking for a good book that will keep you on the end of your seat read: True Confessions of Miss Charlotte Doyle, the Man Who was Poe, or Wolfrider."
4,"Frankie Wattleston, Radio Addict!","Another Avi's WWII-set juvenile, with a novel approach: the story is told completely through dialog, like a Golden Age of Radio presentation--appropriate as our hero, Frankie Wattleston, is crazy about radio, specifically the kids' and adults' adventure serials that populate the airwaves. He and his best friend Mario create, through Frankie's vivid imagination, their own misadventures as they spy on Mr. Swerdlow, a medical-school student who is boarding at Frankie's home--and try to help their teacher, whose boyfriend was killed in battle. This is a lively, funny story about a boy addicted to radio series the way kids today are addicted to video games. I'm not sure I can quite believe that Frankie's teacher or parents would be so gullible sometimes, and the ending with Frankie's brother, withdrawn after his return from combat, seems a bit pat, but the dialog and radio series' quotes make up for any shortcomings."
1,Edwin's Review,"The most confusing and boring book ever was the book called ""Who Was That Masked Man Anyway?"" because there were two detectives and you couldn't really know who was the real detective. It takes a long time to get to your mystery, like three chapters away. When you get to the third chapter there are now two mysteries and you couldn't define who was one character and who was the other one. I would rate this book a one star because it was a really confusing book. There were details in the book that didn't fit with the mystery. The book was boring because there weren't any details that stood out to me. It was a book that was really boring and not entertaining."
3,"Good book, but condition left a lot to be desired",This book was labeled 'good' condition. I would consider what I received fair. There was writing all in it. This was a cardboard book and the binding is coming apart and some of the pages near the binding are falling apart. I like the book but will consider very carefully buying something used. Buyer beware.
3,wish was new,"I liked the selection of songs in this piano book. Wanted to buy a new one, but only was able to see similar product with different selection of songs.Thus I had to buy a used one, which was OK for home use, but not for gift, due to multiple wears. This is why I rated three, not five stars."
5,Perfect companion when writing your admission essay,As the title says this book shows you how to write a successful admission essay. There are 50+ successful essays inside this book and they are helpfully organized by topic. All of the essays are well-written (no surprise!) and are really inspirational when you are writing your own essay. The other part of the book that is helpful are the interviews with admission officers. They help to put the essay into perspective and don't seem shy about telling us what they are looking for in our essays. I used this book when writing my college admission essays and I was accepted at all of my colleges!
4,A love story?,"I've taught this book to my high school senior English class for the past three years. They enjoy it quite a bit--much to their collective suprise.I'm fascinated by the fact that other reviews have described this as a love story. One of the issues that always comes up in class is Summer's motivation for helping Hatter. Is he doing it for her or for himself? If he is doing it for himself, is he motivated by naiveté, altruism, or selfishness--does he want to ""prove"" how he alone can save Hatter and thereby confirm his prejudice that he is superior to Levering and Winton?I would recommend this book not as a love story, but as one that causes us to question our own motives for helping, and perhaps for loving, other people."
4,Hatter Fox,Hatter Fox is a puzzle. This book took me a while to figure it out. I enjoyed reading it after I did. Ms. Harris always gets you to think about the world around you in ways like no one else can.
1,Worst book I have ever read.,"This book may be written well, and has a good message, but the author sold out in the ending. It seems Ms. Harris just got tired of writing the book. I have read other of her books and they were not ended in such an abrupt way."
3,Nice read for a rainy day...for all of you that just love western romances.,"I am a huge fan of Jodi's work. I just finished reading ""Texas Rain"" and what a disappointment. Through out the book I kept asking myself is this is the same Jodi that I came to know over the years? The beginning is interesting and charming the whole idea of a heroine on the run somehow appealed to me. However this is where it ended. I just couldn't get over the fact that she refused to marry the hero, but it was OK to fool around with him...Travis on the other hand did come through as a typical Jodi's hero- perfect! I just hope the next installment will be much better."
4,Great Series so far,So far I have really like the Whispering Mt Series.I have read a lot of Jodi Thomas books love her work. I am really anxious for Sage's story hope it will come out soon Mary Ann
5,Story Time Swan Princess a Hit,Over the last two years my little girls Aunt stated buying a dolls from the Story Time Princess series. For her B-day my daughter saw the Swan Princess and it was a must have. I have like these dolls as they are made from quality materials. The dresses are well made and just right for my little girl (age 6).
4,The idiosyncrasies of our language,"Balistreri highlights the subtle nuances that set the English language apart from all others. People seldom realize that they speak English so poorly, even those who are masters of grammar usage. I think this book should be required reading for all higher level high school English classes. It really points out just how much we abuse and misuse our language."
2,Caveat Emptor,"I bought this ages ago from a catalog as it was described as ""hilarious"" and a romp through what we don't realize we're revealing. I finally picked it up tonight and feel the fool for having wasted my money. I found it neither funny nor a romp. I did, however, find it over-simplified, pretentious, and judgmental. Is that direct enough, Madame Author?"
2,lalique for Woman eau de Parfume,I like the scent although it's more like an eau de toilette. I tried it because it was on sale it and was still priced higher than other sale fragrances. I thought Lalique would do better. I am extremely disappointed by the cheap bottle. I would expect more of a brand such as Lalique known for their glass. The lid is cheap plastic and does insult to the brand.Lalique By Lalique For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.3 Ounces
1,Should have known better ....,"I purchased this perfume from Saks Fifth Ave. and returned it after hearing that I could get it at Amazon for less money. Well, they wrong!!! It is like wearing nothing at all. I feel like I have been robbed ... Never again will I purchase another perfume from this website or any other website on Amazon."
1,Not worth the time of day! You might as well eat nails.,"The horrible truth of the matter is that the great lemay isn't so great. In fact, her work is quite terrible. I beat my head against the wall trying to learn Java with this book for over a month. When I wasn't fighting one of the dozens of errors in the code, I was trying to figure out what the heck the author was talking about or what the heck the author skipped. I don't care what anyone else tells you, this book just isn't worth the headache"
3,"short but concise descriptions, good for a beginner","good book for a starter, very much like L.Lemays other books. Everything is covered but in short. gives the general overview of JDK1.1 and Java1.1"
2,"If you buy this book, you are taking your chances.","After reading over half of the first edition, I feel the content of the book is just about right for someone new to Java with a little experience in C++. However, by the time you are half way through, many of the programs, whether in the book, or on the CD-ROM, simply don't perform the way they are intended. Snippets of code, and example programs are no good if they don't work."
2,The road to ruin is paved with 21 days of technical jargon..,"The author(s) start off simply enough. The first 14 days are pretty much the standard fare of all the other Java books I've tried. ""Here's an applet, here's an application, here's the difference, arrays, variables, pointers, etc."". But once you hit day 14, look out. The easygoing methodology is gone and you get a freight train of programming jargon right in the face. By day 18, I was digging around for a C++ dictionary to see if maybe that would help. Day 19...I just stopped trying.Frequent errors exist in the coding syntax of thesamples, leading beginners down a road of complete frustration.If you're looking for something more useful, go online and find the ""Brewing Java"" homepage. Or, pick up ""Teach Yourself Java in 24 hours"".By the way, there's no way you'll complete some sections of ""...Java in 21 days"" in a day. Some sections take 3-4 days to swim through the muck of programming jargon."
1,Poorly written by unknowledgable authors,"This book may be good for people who just want to play around with the language and not do anything powerful, but I think it will get a programmer off on the wrong foot. It seems like the authors don't know the language very well. The authors should become certified before attempting to teach what they know to others."
3,Too much name for the content,You will learn very basic things. If you want to learn interesting things there are better books there. The first two weeks are interesting but the last one is boring. The 24 hours book from Sams is more concise
2,Fair...but not Great,"I would like to meet Laura Lemay (the main author) to ask her three questions:1) Why are there so MANY typos and errors?2) Why did you name the book 'Learn Java 1.1 in 21 Days' when much of the book covers Java 1.02?3) Why are there so MANY typos and errors? (or did I already say that? hint hint)The reality is, the book is not bad, but it really suffers from bad editing, a preoccupation with Applets over Applications, and wastes FAR too much time covering the JDK 1.02 (considering the title says it is covering JDK 1.1). The first week or so was well written (again, not counting the typos and sloppy editing), but some chapters were far too long to reasonably cover in one day.My recommendation is that you look at the Core Java Series books (vols I & II) and at Just Java and Beyond (all three are VERY well written and are much more robust than 'Learn Java 1.1 in 21 Days')."
2,Who are the target audiences?,"Who are the target audiences? Beginner Java programmers or expert Java programmers? If you are a beginner Java programmer, this book (especially second half of the book) will confuse you and if you are an experienced Java programmer, this book won't worth a dime.Evidently, the authors of this book lack the expert knowledge on the Java programming."
2,you can buy a better book,"The last part of the book (3rd week) is not well written compared to the 1st and 2nd week. It brushes through topics without giving clean explanation, particularly for the 1st time java readers."
2,I wish I would have given my $30 for charity instead !!!,"I started this book with great hope. Certainly the author has taken great efforts listing all minute points that beginers may overlook. This approach works well for the first week. But in the second week pace should have been more. You start developing the feeling that this book is too verbose. Also when it comes to explaining the real concept, the book just winds up the discission in 2/3 lines. Let me give one example - page 274 explains handleEvent() handler. There is mention of returning of true/false. The explanation for this return value should have been more concrete. Instead the author leaves the reader very confused about the role this return value plays. My advice will be NOT to go for this book."
3,Weeks 1&2 - Thumbs up. Week 3 is all downhill,"The first two weeks by Lemay were enjoyable, concise, informative, not overbearing, and useful.Week three by Perkins was stuffy, incomprehensible, confusing, overly complex and poorly written. We (the readers) aren't all PhD thinkologists.Next time, maybe Charles should let Laura translate for him first.Aside from that, the entire book could use some better proofreading and QA vs. the companion CD."
2,"Lots of pages, very few examples","This book is poorly organized and paced quite rapidly. I recommend a good background in C++ before attempting to wade through these exercises.The authors do not make use of many hands on examples, relying instead upon their verbose explanations to get their ideas across. The book spends the entire first week explaining the basics of Java (and some pretty heavy OOP theory) without letting you get your hands dirty on the code. While this might be fine for experienced programmers who have a grasp of OOP, beginners to Java could benefit from more interaction with the ideas presented. The examples that are given are not explained in much detail and many of the statements(in the examples) are not defined until later in the book. This makes it very difficult to grasp the overall concepts presented. There are much better books out there for learing Java."
1,Java in 21 Days 1.1,"I would say The Beginning is very good for people having no concept of OOPS and want to start with Java programming specially Laura Lemay, I would say is one of the best autor and having given good practical examples. However as soon as Charles L. Perkins takes over we are loosing our tracks totally. It cannot be useful because even a simple thing has made so complicated that it will cause you to think as if it is very difficult and there are no examples which you can try and understand. I am not sure want author is trying to achieve. I would suggest to new learners please don't even think of reading Charles L. Perkins portion, it will misguide you and you may loose your further interest in Learning Java"
4,Great if you are a begginer,"I'm reading the spanish version of this book, and it's great for begginers with Java. I know C++ and I think that the book make interesting comparantions between these two languajes. The Java Development Kit attached at this book is unfriendly, but if you have a software like Visual J++, the learning proccess is interesting and fast."
1,A waste of 21 days and more,"i do not find this book to be helpful. It is confusing and poorly organized. In addition, the sample code is full of errors."
