3,A Real Bargain,"I was at a cd store and found this album cheap. I bought it not thinking much, simply remembering that I had heard of them somewhere. After listening to it, I was amazed at how much I lucked out. Although I don't like a lot of the loud tracks, I think it has some amazing slow tracks. Arctic Ocean and Plasma being simply amazing. I would recommend this album to any mainstream rock fan. They remind me of a mix between Disturbed(their newest album, Believe)and the softer side of Finger 11."
3,Hmm not bad...,"I just d/l a few of their songs. Wanna know what the singer sounds like in here: Mix in Aaron Lewis's scratchy voice from Staind, the puddle of mudd singer's screaming voice, and the calmer voice when lead singer of Disturbed, mix it in a blender and u get this lead singer for Sinch. I wasnt impressed really of their songs, or sounds.their sound is techno-ish/311 and at somepoints it sounds like Godsmack... Average cd....pick it up ony if you are looking for a big cd collection to impress someone"
4,An album with much to offer,"When I first got my hands on this cd, I was thinking it was one of those with ""one or two good songs + garbage"".After listening to the whole album twice however, I couldn't have been more wrong.With songs like Armslength, Die in fall, and Arctic ocean, you get a wide variety of flavors. My personal favorite is ""Bitmap""which is eerie and yet catchy.Definitely a must buy, I would recommend this and Orphan, by Darwin's waiting room."
5,Hard Rock Is Back For Good,If you like hard rock this is the best cd i've herd in very long time and it kicks major a$$.
2,Close to ...,"I think that the album has so many different influences that the band doesnt know which way to run with it I was a huge fan of alice in chains but this album lacked a lot. Titles like ""passive resistor?"" wtf man. Some people try too much and thats exactly what these posers are doing. Save your money and buy a haircut, hippies, you'll be much happier with the results."
1,Why do I have to give this CD one star?,"Ok let's be honest, this was [bad]. It was not powerful, or anything else one of the other critics exclaimed Sinch to be. It was pure and whole-heartedly [bad]. I guess if you like depressing dribble from a band that has enough money to not really care about the things they write then this is for you. Maybe I'm just an old fasioned punk but aren't lyrics supposed mean something other than ""my life sux sooooo bad""?"
5,A thorough reference guide for glass bead makers!,"What an exceptional book! I did research on safety and ventilation regarding lampworked glass beads for almost an entire year before I set up my studio. This book is the BEST that I have found on the subject of ventilation to prevent toxicity, setting up the studio and all the various components involved in making glass beads. Mr. Kervin also included information about hazardous fuels, storage procedures, how to maintain your oxygen and propane tanks, as well as kiln maintenance. I HIGHLY recommend this handy reference guide! Everything (and more) than I wanted to know is right at my fingertips! There is nothing negative about the book, not one single thing!!"
5,Gods and Heroes,The book arrived in excellent shape. It was gratefully received as a gift to my granddaughter. I was very pleased with this purchase.
5,Keating knows her stuff,Dr. Keating is extremely knowledgeable and experienced in the area of curricula development and review. This book is a great resource for new nursing educators or those preparing for curriculum revision or new development.
2,Outdated,"I purchased this CD for my 16-month-old in order to have music for him while he's playing or laying down. I bought it because of all of the great reviews I'd read. Unfortunately, I didn't look at the year it was made. While the music is quality music, it's dated and before my time; completely not to my liking. I was pretty disappointed with the CD, unfortunately, and will probably be getting rid of it."
3,There are better titles for learning Hungarian!,"First thing about this book: there is absolutely no English in it. In order to learn any vocabulary, you'll need a dictionary or some translation software. I understand it is geared towards foreigners from all nations learning Hungarian, and it does that well, but if you're looking for a book for English speakers learning Hungarian this is not your best bet.Additionally, there is no pronunciation or phrasebook section. If you're looking for things like that, a phrasebook from Lonely Planet or Berlitz would be better.This book excels in basic sentence building and grammar lessons. They're displayed in a really concise and easy-to-get manner. There are illustrations to help point out grammar items, and a lot of space for taking notes. However, I'd suggest going with ""A Practical Hungarian Grammar"" by Szita and Gorbe, available here, as a better choice."
4,About what you expect to get,"Nice toy, my 19 month old enjoys playing rocket with it and counting backwards ""3...2...1..."" It's pretty much what you expect to get from the picture. The only two negatives that I would say are:#1 - Smells like vinyl, which gives me instant headaches (I put it out in the hot sun to burn this smell away which was effective.)#2 - Mine has a slow leak so it turns into a raison after a few daysOn the positive side, it has a spot where you can hang it from the ceiling, and stands upright on it's back ready to launch.For the money, it's a good value."
1,Unreliable delivery,"I ordered this subscription in January 2004. To date (September 2004) I have received only TWO issues. These came together in one mailing in June after many emails and phone calls of complaint for non-receipt of merchandise. Nine months after paying almost $160.00, I have gotten only these two issues, and am preparing to send yet ANOTHER email to find out where the rest of my issues are. Based on the TWO issues that I have read, this is a great publication for afficianados of military tech, but its value is greatly diminished by the fact that its distribution is so flawed."
5,"J'adore Pink Martini et ""Sympathique""","I heard a sample of ""sympathique"" a few months ago, and immediately, I went out and bought the album, which was absolutely amazing. I especially love ""Children of Piraeus"" and how well China Forbes is able to sing in whatever accent the song requires. Everyone should sample this."
4,Tres cool,"What a great album. I first heard several tracks on a compendium album I picked up in Starbuck's, of all places, and flipped over China Forbes. Mui caliente! The other tracks are great as well, with a mixture of interesting syncopated rhythms as well as arrangements echoing from the hip, sophisticated,jazzy past."
5,"great ""opera prima""!!","I heard pink martini for the first time in 2004, trying to find some music for one of my shortcuts; the song was called ""la soledad"", and from that moment and on, I was a devoted fan of pink martini.their style is unique, and I could hardly find specific words to describe it. pink martini is, if not an innovator, an enormous performer of his tracks which, by themselves, are beautiful resurrections of the past. a nice hope to the future, and a view with excelent mood to the days we live on."
5,Great artists and great songs,"I heard them in Riga at art caffe and I was amazed by what I heard. At the same night I ordered a copy through Amazon.com and waited impatiently for it. Perfect set of atmpsphere, elegance and style. It has it all.... Looking forward to hear their next album."
5,"Great band, great album!","After listening to Hey Eugene (which I would also recommend), I explored earlier albums of Pink Martini. This one is a classic. I particularly like the dissonant version of Que Sera Sera. So much talent displayed on one CD."
5,sympathique review,This cd is incredible. I love their style and the vocals are superb! I will continue to purchase more of their music.
4,Sympathique! Amazing,"I have loved Pink Martini since the day my husband gave me ""Hang on Little Tomato"" for my birthday.When I found out these incredible musicians had produced an earlier CD, I raced out to buy it.The sounds were similar. Tunes in four or five different languages. Catchy remakes of several wonderful songs I remembered from my past. I only wish I had heard the first CD first. Because their new CD ""Hang On Little Tomato"" is so, so, so good, ""Sympathique"" remaines only amazing."
2,Don't spend the extra $$ - DVD will not play,"Love the group; love the music; the DVD is not compatible with North American DVD formats, and will not play in your DVD player. no need to spend the extra $$."
5,SYMPATHIQUE,I purchased this CD after I saw Pink Martini perform at Carnegie Hall a few years ago. They are absolutely wonderful and this album is just great. Very eclectic with such a variety that everyone could enjoy at least one song in the bunch -- if not all as I do. I played it for a friend recently and wound up purchasing him a surprise CD of Sympathique since he enjoyed it so much.
5,The best.,This CD is very upbeat and extremely creative. This is my second one. I wore the first one out.
2,Musical Hodgepodge,"A hodgepodge of music featuring some really bad French and a bleating trumpet. Some tracks shine while others made me cringe. A real disappointment. I should have listened to all the samples before buying it and not just assumed it would all be similar to the tracks I heard on the radio. Probably the worst version of Que Sera Sera I have ever heard, tho it is not a song I cared for to begin with. Like one review says, it's a variety of music, tho I add: none of which is related other than being from the same planet... not an ethnic fusion, just a sampler of divergent sounds. Reminds me of the Lawrence Welk Show, tho not as good technically. One for the back of the drawer."
5,"Without a doubt, my favorite CD in my collection","Simply put, this graceful compellation of sounds is my most favorite in my collection of over 600 albums. These Oregonians reach to all ends of the earth for musical inspiration and then brilliantly synthesize it into something entirely fresh. This CD is perfect for pleasing all generations of listeners, and if you get the chance, Pink Martini is fantastic in concert...nothing is done to their sound in a studio...all of the talent on all of the instruments is God given."
2,"Nice Music, Poor Selection.","I bought this CD after hearing a glowing review about it on NPR. I thought I'd get a fun retro jazz selection. About half of the album is what I thought it would be. The other half ruins it... If only they had produced this album without Que Sera, Sera, Bolero and Acuarela de Brazil - it would have been much stronger. Some of these are so cliche that they just hurt to listen to them.Luckily there are a few good tracks, Let's just hope they refine their taste before the next album, or we might have to listen to a jazzed up version of ""send in the clowns""."
3,Good but not great,"Okay, so I bought into all the great reviews of this album. All I can say is, eh... It's good, easy to listen to at work when I need something in the background, but it isn't great. Now, I typically get into this genre of music (as I really love Paolo Conte), and the title track is fabulous (notwithstanding the over-enuciated french) because la chanteuse breathes ""je fume."" I smoke, so whenever I hear someone sing about smoking, I smile, especially since here in Bloomington they just passed a stupid smoking ban. Anyway, I would say, buy the CD used, or save your money--I'm just not into this album."
2,Boring & Inoffensive,"Obviously a lot of people like this CD, but I am not one of them. It has a couple of songs that are nice, but for me it is mostly a wide variety of reasonably boring and inoffensive music... not bad (except for ""Que Sera, Sera"" which I don't like with the exception of Sly Stone's version), but nothing to very captivating either."
5,Quality musicians and recordings,"Accidentally found this group and think they show talent both in performance and track selection. Acoustically very interesting, fine vocals."
4,Uplifting,"I have this cd and ""Hang On Little Tomato"" after seeing Pink Martini in concert this summer. They are truly dynamic and I love how they revel in singing songs from various cultures. Songs are touching, lively, passionate and uplifting!"
5,Excellent buy for lovers of exotic music.,"When I saw Pink Martini in concert at the Portland, Oregon POPS, I was completely enthralled . I didn't expect the CD to compare, but it captures the atmosphere, the spirit, and the desire of each song perfectly. This collection offers intoxicating pleasure."
4,Really good music,"This is a very good album -- not generally my type of music (jazz), but this is really good. China Forbes' voice is beautiful."
5,Pink Martini is fantastic,"Learned about this group on NPR -- of course -- and they are fabulous. Lead singer China Forbes is astounding, and the ""little orchestra"" is -- well, just enjoy -- trust me, you'll get every one of their albums, which we hope, will come much more frequently!!! Bravo!"
5,"A varied and entertaining collection, well recorded","This is an often amusing, very pleasurable listen. The overall theme, I guess, is ""lounge music"", but Pink Martini is really much more than that. Think torch song meets latin meets 50's/60's kitsch and you'll be in the right ballpark. A bonus is that the songs are fairly well recorded for a band of this stature.Highly recommended."
5,My New Favorite CD,"My acupuncturist gave me this CD two weeks ago in our continuing effort to top each other in music finds.Ok, he won. I'm not sure what grabs me the most about this work: the elegance of the music, the subtle arrangements, or the exquisite satire. ""Bolero"" is closer to what I imagine Ravel ever hoped for, and the psycho version of ""Que Sera Sera"" has become the theme for my life, and I want it played at my funeral. (This despite the most excellent version of the same ditty by The Kinsey Sicks!!) And to hear ""Never on Sunday"" in Greek just makes me squirm!Run, don't walk to find this one!"
5,John Wayne Western Collection,"What can I say about John Wayne. He was my favorite Cowboy from the time I was little in the 40's. He may have made a few NOT SO GOOD movies in his early years, but I don't think there was anyone that could surpass him in his later years. His movie collections are the best and very intertaining. Well worth watching if you like Cowboy movies as much as I do. Its too bad the cowboy era has passed."
1,very old movies,"there is only 1 colour movie in the collection........these movies are too old, thought they would be newer John Wayne movies."
5,Awesome collection of John Wayne movies(old and new),This DVD collection though expensive is a collection of all Good Western movies of John Wayne. I have yet to watch all of them. The picture and audio quality is excellent. I am not able to play the DVD on a PC using vlc. It plays fine on a DVD player though. If you are John Wayne Fan I recommend this.
1,Nice looking on the outside but not functional,The outside of the purse looks nice. The purse itself is heavy. It is difficult to find anything inside as there is only one handle and the opening is small. There is one huge compartment so finding things makes it even more difficult. There are some pockets on one side but they are not deep enough to hold anything without them eventually falling out while looking for something in the main compartment. There is one zippered pocket on the other side. I'm going to buy another person and stop using this one.
4,GOOD!,the quality of the pics are excellent!the only con is the movie that you can take is max 3 min for every clip no matter how big is your CF card......
5,Awesome camera!,"I love this camera, and I take it everywhere I can, cuz you never know when you might have a Kodak moment! The only complaint I have is the redeye...even though it claims to have redeye reduction, boy is there a lot of it! Oh well, nothing a little photoshop editing can't take care of. Besides that, this is THE camera to get."
4,Just Peachy,"We were looking to upgrade from the much bigger / bulkier Sony mavica. After plenty of research, we chose the Canon S230 - mainly for its VERY compact size and light weight. I give it 5 stars for portability. It literally fits in a shirt pocket.The quality of the images are good - but a little ""hit and miss"". The 2x zoom is a shortcoming, and many photos turn out ""soft"". The red eye reduction feature is not very effective.Overall, we're pleased with the S230....but don't expect perfection."
5,Great Camera,"This is my first digital camera. I think it is great. This camera is very easy to use and with a little exploration and common sense, all of the options are very easy to use. I've only had the camera for 2 weeks now, but it takes great pictures, and coupled up with the canon I850 Priner, 4x6 pictures are coming out just like photos developed from the store. The color and detail are very impressive.The only down side to the camera is the small 16 memory card. I've already bought a larger one for not much cost, and now I can take plenty of pictures without running out of memory."
5,a very nice compact camera,"I bought this little thing several months age. I didn't go anyhere without it.It's so nicely designed that you can carry it to any place.With those advanced features ,you can take very sharp pics. digitally developed photoes are no less vivid than those taken by optical cameraes.I love it"
5,High Quality in a small package,"I shopped for digital cameras for months, read the reviews, asked the experts at various stores and finally bought the S230. The best features of this camera are: It will fit in your shirt pocket, it is made of all metal (no plastic), the movie mode goes for about 2 minutes (which is the longest I've ever seen), it uses a rechargable lithium Ion battery (no AA's here), it is very easy to zoom in/out with the same finger you will snap the picture, the digital zoom is incredible, and the photos are absolutely fabulous. I take some of my digital photos and have prints made. They look like they came from a film camera. I find myself taking a lot of photos, as it is so easy to just put it in your shirt pocket just in case you need it. This is my second Digital Elph....I highly recommend it."
4,really good!,this was a really good camera. took really good pics. the only think i didn't like was the shutter speed. took really long for it to take the actual pic. otherwise everything else was good.
4,Pretty Good,I have not had any problems with this camera. The only annoying thing is that the Flash is way to bright so if you are taking pictures at home it really washes stuff out. But then again if you turn the flash off it is then too dark...ah will. If you have the right light though everything is fine. I am planning on trying like paper or something over the flash to mute it. It might work. But good camera. I will be using this for years to come. I recomend the 256MB Viking Flash card. You get more memory. It is REALLY work it. You can get almost 2000 photograghs!!
4,Great Little Digicam,"This is a really great camera. Has a lot of features like autostitch and movie recorder (has a built in microphone). Allows you to change picture settings like b/w, sepia...Very convenient to carry around, fits into a pant pocket easily."
4,You get exactly what you pay for,"I owned an S110 before it was swiped from my desk drawer. The little puppy could do quite a lot.I thought that it had all that I needed.I recently bought the S230- it's quite the camera, and now it has more features than I know how to use correctly, like manual ISO settings, manual shutter speed, etc. Considering the size of the camera, the image quality is excellent. However, considering the size, it's easily lost or stolen.On a side by side comparison with a sony camera, the canon tends toward a red shift, where the sony tends toward the blue. This makes skin tones look great on the canon, whereas the sony takes some great landscapes (the sony pictures of the sunset over San Francisco Bay blew the canon out of the water)I have a 128mb CF card, and always run down the battery before the card fills. I haven't tried turning off the LCD to see if it helps.I held back 5 stars simply because 5 stars should be a flawless product. In my mind, 4 stars is still excellent."
2,Ddate can NOT be displayed in pictures on PC,"When you print the pictures taken from Canon digital cameras, date can be printed out. However, you can not have the images displayed with date on your computer!"
1,Subject to CCR Image Sensor Defect,"Please be advised that this model, along with several other Canon digital cameras, is subject to an advisory issued by Canon regarding a ""CCR Image Sensor"" defect. A part in the camera made by Sony is susceptible to a loose connection. In shooting mode the image appears as a purplish/black distorted image. Canon stated in their advisory that this would be fixed free of charge regardless of warranty expiration. I returned my camera to Canon repair and just received a repair estimate of $109.62. I am very disappointed with Canon's response to this. Google ""Canon customer complaints"" and you will find a long list of customers with similar complaints about Canon repair services. I am about to drop out of the technology revolution."
3,Great camera --- for a while.,This camera was fantastic for four years. Then it died -- all the photos I've taken in the last few months have been pink.
5,a great gift,"i've had it for a while now and am extremely happy with it. the battery life is just fine, the optical zoom is a plus because its greatest feature is its small size. its very portable and it can be taken anywhere. oh, and the 3.2 megapixel photos turn out great."
3,Not so good as I expected,"I bought the camera after reading the reviews and believe this is what I need with such a low price.When I first saw this small camera I really felt it is cute.Then I began to take pictures. But all the pictures in-door and out-door come to be soft. Just not sharp or clear enough. I was really disappointed.Only the ones I took very clost the object seem to have satifying quality.The flash is very weak, too.Disappointedly I had to return the camera. Not sure if this is Canon's problem or the camera is just defective.BTW, I saw my friend's Canon S30, which seems to work much better than this one."
3,Chaldean Numerology Rules... Period,"There are not many books on Chaldean numerology so I was pleased to come across this and have been using this system for over a year now and find it is very useful. I went back and re-calculated all my previous ""pythagorean"" charts I did for friends and family and find the Chaldean alphabet to be more accurate.I would also recommend getting a copy of Gerun Moore's Numbers Will Tell.The only critique I have of this book is that I wanted a more advanced explanation as to how the author derived or came up with some of his findings."
1,Total garbage,If you like your movies to look like a bad VHS transfer and shot with a handy cam then this home movie is for you. The only horror in this film is that it was put onto DVD and being sold to the public instead of being passed around free to the friends of the people that created this mess.This isn't a review but a warning for unsuspecting people to not waste their money or shelf space.
4,Great book as a part of the series,"Matadora seems to follow the Man Who Never Missed rather indirectly, with the main characters following in the footsteps of that man, Emile Antoon Khadaji. The setting is a unique mix of science fiction and martial arts of the kind found in the best Hong-Kong action films. The universe is deep and consistent, and revealed expertly.Dirisha, a martial arts master searching for more in life, finds a school training the best bodyguards in the galaxy. It also has a few political goals. Matadora's plot flows well but ends in a very perfunctory way without actually resolving any of the major plot arcs, obviously to flow into the next book. For the most part, this is not a disadvantage. Note also, there are several explicit sex scenes, one of them homosexual.Lastly, the book is a very fast read. I finished it in about two hours. Negative points for the low value for cost and the ending."
5,Couldn't Put It Down!,"I started the Matador series with this book and HAD to have all the others. It's fast paced, well written and has a Black WOMAN as the main character. When was the last time you read a book with all of these qualities. Dirisha takes no prisoners in love or war. Yes, there is some sex but it's not X-rated and last I heard sex is a normal part of life. This book has killing, too and that should be (but isn't) more offensive than sex.The series is a great read as is anything by Steve Perry, who has become one of my favorite authors. :)"
1,Junk..Max write speed is 2 X...not 8 X...waste of $$$$,Max write speed I could ever obtain was 2X! 8x+8X- is a joke...CS/Tech Support also matches the product. If you want to throw away good $$$ buy this dog.
5,Poor little boy should have bought from a store,The sour grapes little boy should under stand why he wouldn't get tech support when purchasing from an outsider. This is one of the ways a company has to protect themselves. Think ahead in the future.
3,Customer Service,"Who cares where he bought it? If he purchased it brand new, and it is not damaged, provided that the product was not stolen from the manufacturer, the manufacturer made money by selling the product, therefore should provide technical support.That really does sound really bad...."
1,DO NOT BUY PACIFIC DIGITAL PRODUCTS,"I BOUGHT AN EXTERNAL CD BURNER FROM AN INTERNET SELLER. IT CAME BRAND NEW IN A SEALED BOX WITH ALL THE WARRANTY CARDS AND EVERYTHING. I AM HAVING TROUBLE INSTALLING IT SO I CALLED PACIFIC DIGITAL SEVERAL TIMES FOR HELP ONLY TO GET VOICEMAIL. MY EMAILS WERE NEVER ANSWERED EITHER. WHEN I FINALLY GOT THROUGH THEY TOLD ME I COULDN'T GET SUPPORT BECAUSE I BOUGHT FROM AN ""UNAUTHORIZED SELLER""!!THAT IS UNCONSCIONABLE!!! THIS COMPANY WILL BE OUT OF BUSINESS SOON BECAUSE THEY DO NOT STAND BY WHAT THEY SELL."
1,DO NOT BUY PRODUCTS FROM PACIFIC DIGITAL!!!,"I BOUGHT A PACIFIC DIGITAL EXTERNAL CD BURNER FROM AN INTERNET SELLER. IT CAME BRAND NEW IN A SEALED BOX WITH ALL THE WARRANTY CARDS AND EVERYTHING.

THIS COMPANY WILL BE OUT OF BUSINESS SOON BECAUSE THEY DO NOT STAND BY WHAT THEY SELL."
2,Only for the Ambitious,"You should NOT buy this book if: 1) you are going to Hong-Kong for a week, and want to get the basics of the language. 2) you already know Mandarin or any other language using Chinese characters.Why? The first 10 or so words you learn are different kinds of fruit. You have to memorize all these to be able to go on to the exercises. This may be fine if you intend to get a huge vocabulary, but for most beginners, 10 different fruits are not the most urgent need. The book goes on in the same way with chunks of specialised but not necessarily useful words.The next problem is that hardly any Chinese characters are used, so you get little or no help from your possible previous knowledge of Chinese or Japanese. I bought the book, because it provided CDs with the text, and I still think that's its main advantage. I still haven't learnt Cantonese very well, but I've started using another book (Teach Yourself) in parallel, and that helps a lot."
4,Good Text - CD Shouldn't Be Sold Separately,"In my view, this book isn't very useful without the CD, just as the CD isn't very useful without the book. When combined with the CD, I like the presentation of the material as well as the exercises. With the CD, the format is similar to the Teach Yourself package, but the presentation and content are quite different. For a language like Cantonese, and probably most other spoken languages, it's very helpful to have audio materials. I wouldn't want this book by itself, but it's been helpful when combined with the CD."
1,Not Recommended,"This book is not for anybody who has not had a reasonable amount of cantonese language training. I picked it up not knowing any, and I still don't. The tapes are useless for learning how the sounds are put together and how each individual sound in the language should be pronounced. They are in dialogue format and what seems like full speed. There is very little time in the tapes devoted to pronunciation and rhythm and the lesson planning leaves me with the ability to sell and buy mangoes, little more. I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere to learn Cantonese."
1,Art Film FAILURE,"Many things went wrong with this attempt to produce a movie-classic for students of the arts. Failures include; the wide angle shots are blurry, panning was to fast, camera ""taped"" to moving vehicles bounced and osculated creating further distractions. There was NO SOUND (home movie quality) and VERY LONG periods of no captions to aid in figuring out what was said or going on(choice was ENGLISH or press 2 for SPANISH). I never did guess why he chose this remote village and his trip there was recorded in too large of jumps. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME."
1,This is Art!,"One night not too long ago while suffering from insomnia and indigestion I turned on the tee vee and caught this flick. The fact that it was showing on cable past midnight should have been a fair warning. In a nutshell, this is about a suicidal, scraggy looking dude with a limp who goes to some godforsaken village and buggers an old shriveled-up hag. For good measure, we get to see horse on horse porn and lots of gratuitous violence involving incredibly stupid and ugly looking people. Enjoy!"
1,Table Cracked,I would like to meet the people that put this table together in 2 hours. It is not easy to assemble. After spending approximately 4 hours to assemble I removed the plastic protective cover from the table top to reveal a crack. Now that sucks.Customer service with Amazon was very cooperative in coordinating the return of the table.I believe I will be replacing this with a different product.
5,A Great Table the family can all enjoy !,"Very well done . . . delivered on schedule, my son got to assemble it, and the family now has an ""indoor"" fun event!The table met ""all"" expectations. While at bit cumbersome, unassembled it goes anywhere . . . Hopefully my family will enjoy ittogether for years to come."
1,Better off with the original's,"If your looking for the Stray Cats success in Ignition, better off not purchasing this album because '68 Comeback Special Ignition needs an overhaul. My personal feelings is this album lacks the bluesy slide style Setzer had success with the Stray Cats. There are a lot of songs that have the same sounds and those songs that mix it up a bit fall short of toe tappin, hip swayin jive music. Better luck next time Brian. I like his swing success better!"
5,The fans have been waiting for this one!,"After several years and 4 albums with the orchestra, Mr. Sezter whips up a rousing batch of goodies with a Stray Cats style band. These guys jam their way through this CD with familiar sounding, but all new material. The songs are great fun and my kids and I dance around and sing along to the whole CD. The energy level is high, the lyrics are clever, and best of all Brian Setzer has a whale of a time blazing out one awesome riff after another. This is a must-have for guitar enthusiasts. My favorite songs were the punked-out Get 'em on the Ropes, and the scorching opener, Ignition. But they're all good. Brian Setzer is clearly at the top of his game. Love the cover art too! Get it!"
4,Great........... But,"Ignition is an amazing CD. It is great to have Brian Setzer get back to the roots of his playing. The 1st track will make your jaw drop and CRANK IT UP! He really kicks butt on this album. However the downer is there is not anough rockabilly. He gets alittle too popish on some tunes like 59. He seems to try and do the old school rock and roll, but Setzer is a rockabilly cat. The album is a must have for any true Greaser or Sun Record fan. But be ready the first tune sets up the album as the best dang thing you have heard but the rest of it is not as energized. Over all a great album though. Better than the orchestra."
3,"Buy ""Angela's Ashes"" instead. The ending ruins the entire film","Enjoyed this movie even though it was a little slow. The little boy was a character you have to love. The ending just didn't go with the crises faced by the characters in this movie. They totally blew it on the ending. It ruined the whole movie for me. Try watching ""Angela's Ashes"" instead. One of the best movies you will ever see. One last comment, this movie does a pretty good job at making priests and Catholic school teachers seem like terrorists to little kids. I can't imagine being raised to think that everything you did from the time you were born was a sin against God and made Jesus suffer more...........oh, well. It was the 1930's."
3,"Not a bad film, but...","A somewhat over-obvious drama about a struggling Irish Catholic family living in Liverpool during the Great Depression. Ian Hart plays the agonized father, who just wants a good job, politics be damned; the title character is his son, the innocent through whose eyes we watch the family dissolve and reunite. Liam is caught between his pragmatic, hardbitten Pa and his upright, religious mother, who maintains her faith in the Church, even as it fails to live up to its promise. This film is okay, but somewhat leaden, overly stylized and the plot is too on the nose."
3,A Down Mood,"Eight-year old Liam and his Catholic family live in grimy, industrial Liverpool during the Depression. Liam's Dad loses his job, and each member of the family searches for answers in different places and ways. Their lives become enfolded in bigotry, violence, and social and personal conflicts. Liam, who is being prepared for his First Communion, looks to Catholicism for answers.This is a Serious Movie. It's dark, and it takes some discipline to stay with it. It has a few good insights but raises many more questions.A critic on the Internet says ""Liam"" is more raw than ""Life is Beautiful"" and more genuine than ""Billy Elliot."""
1,Stories of Animal Cruelty,"I agree with the earlier reviewer, as far as mean people and animal cruelty go. I could hardly finish the book myself, not only because of the animal cruelty and abuse but also the author's total indifference to it. I don't particularly care to read about people abusing and killing animals (killing a mother cow because she wants to keep her calf, and shooting 13 puppies because ""they are ugly""), and basically that is what a lot of this book is about. Not a very good or interesting read, author is whiney and self-absorbed - don't waste your time with this garbage."
1,Unpleasant book,I could hardly get through this ugly memoir filled with mean and unsympathetic people. The worst was the extreme cruelty toward animals that runs throughout the entire book. It left me with a very bad taste in my mouth! This book should not have been written!
1,St Paul Pioneer Press questions accuracy,"A front page article in St. Paul Pioneer Press (Dec 15, 2005).Whose story is it? A Minnesota woman's memoir has drawn critical praise. Trouble is, some family members say parts of Nicole Helget's 'The Summer of Ordinary Ways' just aren't true- - - - - - - - - - -Dad never killed a cow with a pitchfork. Mom didn't throw fits. Their family was not poor. There was no abuse in their home.This is what some of Nicole Helget's angry relatives say about her widely praised memoir, ""The Summer of Ordinary Ways."" Published by Minnesota Historical Society's Borealis Books, the book is about the 29-year-old author's childhood on her family's farm near Sleepy Eye.Jeanne Helget, Nicole's mother, says parts of the book are lies. So do two of Nicole's five sisters, her former husband and her aunt.. . .hopefully this link works, and you can read the entire article.http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/news/13409385.htm"
1,"Amusement at animal cruelty, small children dying & lies? Not worth it.","This author goes on and on and on about horrible acts of animal cruelty, but the author seems more amused by it than actually trying to make you feel anything. She says it for shock value and to take up space, not for actual things that happened. I'm ashamed to say that a reading class I know is using this book as an example for their class. This book is a work of fiction, passed as a memoir. The story jumps all over the place, the characters are all ugly people you feel nothing but contempt for, and a lot of the book is focused on the authors amusement at animal cruelty, little girls dying in coffins step-by-step and telling tales. The whole book is obvious that she has a vendetta against her family and is trying to force the reader to jump on the bandwagon of ""They were sooo mean! Let's all hate them!"" It's to expensive to be used as a fire-starter, so I would just skip it. I would have rated it a 0 if possible."
1,In the spirit of Paul Bunyan...,"Reading this ""memoir"" reminds me that the spirit of Paul Bunyan is alive and well in Minnesota. The stories within these bindings smack of tall tales, embellishments manufactured to produce mighty oak trees from a mere acorn of truth. There is cruelty, insanity and other unpleasant arrows directed at family members. Reading these stories, I fear that myself and other readers will never know the truth behind the author's words, what is real and what has been inflated to achieve a certain level of interest for this deplorable book."
4,Good DVD,"This was a good DVD, I am glad that of all the Bee Gees great songs they chose to sing Nights on Broadway and to have a performance by Barry Manilow as well was great. However, I wish the Bee Gees had been able to sing another song or two."
2,"I hate reading about dumb, helpless, scared women.","I should have known from the start. The main character's name is no less than ""KENDRA"". Doesn't that give you a clue? She's weak, insecure, helpless, can't cook very well and pretty stupid. The old helpless victim saga. Finally, she figures things out - but, had I not gotten this book at a rummage sale, I doubt I would have ever read it. It was pretty easy to surmise who the bad guy was. It was about worth what I paid for it - a quarter."
4,Great train and contruction vehicle fun!,"Got the DVD with the Thomas and Friends Train for $9.99 which is a bargain when the Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway train is normally $10 to $14 by itself. All the DVDs that come with a toy train/vehicle included don't have a particular train/vehicle for that title, but they randomly include different characters for the same DVD title. So it always is better to buy one inside a store so you avoid duplicates like I do sometimes. If you don't care about duplicates buying the DVDS with a toy character included online is simpler. If your kid likes Bob the Builder than he/she will probably enjoy these episodes with Jack and the Pack. My son did!"
3,On Site with Thomas...,"BEWARE, although this is a great DVD, it does not come with Jack, the pictured toy, which is very, very disappointing because I had to go buy him separately, since my son loves to play with the toys in the movie. This is the THIRD time I purchased a DVD that advertised a toy, but I got something else."
4,love the train,"Great quality with the movie and train combo, as the trains generally cost around 10 dollars on their own. Only thing I didn't like is that the movie is in a very small case."
3,Season 10,"I am excited, don't forget Jack & The Pack returns. And here are the new characters in Season 10.Jeremy the AircraftRosie the Tank EngineRocky the CraneFearless Freddie, a Warhorse EnginePatrick (Engine)Monty - The PackAnd who is going to be a new narrator? Possibly Carlos Alazraqui will replace Michael Brandon."
2,Deja vu?,"They said it couldn't happen but they were wrong...yet anouther offering from the genre which of late can do little else but fall into the category of 'done to death'. Yes, once more we wander into the world of quint retro shojo Mech. Excuse me if I don't wave my hands in the air and scream girlishly. While I'm sure there are those who'll enjoy this little foray into the life of the average Japanese teenage girl who happens to be in possesion of monolithic mechs, I'm sure most will recognise it for what it truly is. I'm afraid that, in a market where the name 'Gundam' is the be all and end all of what we class as 'classic' full-on Mech, Bubblegum's numerous spawnings monopolise the shojo Mech market and Votoms and the like are the last word in retro cheese, Z-mind is a little out of it's depth."
4,An Excellent Resource,"This book was informative and insightful; very down-to-earth with real-life examples that any parent, teacher or caregiver could relate to whether or not they were familiar with ADHD.This book is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to better understand ADHD in children or adults and the treatment processes involved. It truly is an excellent ""guide for communicating with professionals""."
1,no product to taste,It is really hard to describe something you have never tasted. This company does not like you to get to taste there stuff. Good luck getting your shipment.
2,Is it Too Much to Ask for Beauty and Function?,"A perfect clock for a print lay-out or as a prop on a stage set. Pretty to look at but doesn't deliver on function at all. The clock adjustment knobs on the backside are tiny and difficult to turn (if they turn at all). The button on top of clock to set alarm on/off feature moves so slightly it was difficult to tell if alarm was set as ""on"" or ""off"". Alarm is quiet to start and becomes louder, that was a nice feature. But setting the alarm time was pointless as alarm never started on it's own. Not a reliable product at all."
5,goddesses!!,"this is a great book for anyone who loves a funny, and exiting story.I began to read it and could not stop reading.If you are looking for a good book it's this one."
3,for younger girls,"this book is light fluff. a bit of fun and a little see through. hantman tries to make the tree girls modern by using modern language. it is an ok book, not for someone looking for an excelent tale"
4,"Interesting information, probably not particularly useful..","But highly amusing and fun. This book does not probe the great mysteries of the universe. Of course, Cecil answers questions that we have all tried to at one point or another. I personally, have always wondered how hair knows it has been cut. Thankfully, Cecil knows.I have never even heard of this guy. Whether he is famous in America remains unbeknown to me, but he certainly is far from famous here in Australia. It doesn't make him any less enjoyable, however their are several references to things that will make no sense to the average Australian, and also, considering it was written quite a while ago, no sense to a young reader.However, well worth the purchase, and the website is also worth the effort."
3,not sure,It isn't the best or the worst. I wanted more quick facts then a long story about each one.
2,Not worth it,This has way too much static. It drives me crazy to listen to it. We actually don't even use it anymore because the static is so bad.
2,Not Gene's best work...,"I found the show to be badly marketed, and the use of CGI instead of miniatures stole some of the watchability. Gimme Star Trek or Firefly anyday, a good sci-fi show should mimic westerns. I wonder if reviewers of this show enjoyed Godzilla movies..."
4,"Andromeda, Keepin it ROCKIN!","Andromeda, back in its final season with a bang! Sure the show lost a chunk of the budget that they have had with previous seasons but that doesn't stop the writers from coming up with a nice season long story arc which delivers! Any sci-fi fan with a love of action should add this volume to their collection. Andromeda just plain ROCKS! (4 stars because we should be on collection 5 by NOW!)"
3,Success depends on depth of paint.,I've had mixed results using this product. First try was on a 07' BMW 3 series. The chip was on a vertical section of a door and to my surprise the paint layer was very shallow and as a result the blob eliminator would pull up the touch up paint. Another chip on a more horizontal section of a different door had better results.My current vehicle '11 BMW 3 series has a couple of chips on the hood and the paint seems thicker in this area. As a result I expect it to perform better.This product may perform best on vehicles or areas of a vehicle which have thicker paint.
2,Save your money,"I bought this to repair a couple of chips in my 08 Zo6 Corvette hood. They said it was sooooo good. I followed the steps with the the GM paint I got from the dealer and 5 attempts later I still can not get it to fill in or match up to the existing paint. I should have saved my $50, 2 hours and spent an additional $300 to have it done professionally. Not a good product."
1,Simply does not work,"I had the exact same results as Prof100 did. The blob eliminator completely wipes off every single molecule of touch-up paint with one gentle careful swipe. I tried several times. The very second the blob eliminator even looks at the touch-up paint... it's off the car.If the manufacturer is going to say I didn't apply it correctly and it requires technique.... then you shouldn't sell it to the open public. I used extreme care to attempt to make this product work, and it doesn't. Plain and simple. Myself and other users have tried multiple times with very little/no success. Certainly not acceptable and I feel I have wasted my money. DO NOT BUY."
2,Not for coarse hair,"Got this as a natural alternative, and although I love all things natural, I also know that sometimes it might not get the job done. This formula says for all hair types, but it clearly does not work on coarse thick hair. I have very strong hair that resists most waxes...so I kind of knew better than to try this. The design is nice and helps you apply an even thin layer, however the wax does cool quickly and I don't wax next to my microwave. It removed maybe 1/3 of my leg hair, and you can only do a couple passes. The thinner lighter hair on my inner thigh was 75% removed after the second pass...which shows that it just can't tackle the tough stuff."
5,A very good collection of disco songs,"I bought this CD for the second time, because my previous one was robbed along with my CD changer and my car. I love this Cd, specially for the song ""This Time Baby"", a real hard-to-find precious stone, which is presented in a extended version and with high quality sound. The ""Flashdance/Maniac"" megamix is somehow strange and feels ""not contemporary"" to the other tracks. Even so, for disco lovers, it is a must buy!"
3,Not his best,I enjoy Oppenheim's novels for their espionage elements and period flair. I derived some pleasure from this one but it is not a favorite. I don't object to the fantastical story line as most of his books have that. My problem was in wanting to slap the so-called heroine. The author often makes his women too bizarre but Phillipa is beyond belief. Henry would be better off without the stupid ditz! Still it was free :)
5,"Step aside slowhand, Mr Bonamassa has arrived",Simply put.....This guy is the greatest guitar player to ever hit this planet....if Joe plays on it..i buy it.....we have seen him live 40 times in 12 states and the district. in a lil under 5 years...never a bad show....I know i'm gonna catch hell for the greatest comment...but i have seen him live 40 times..go see one of his shows then come back and tell me he's not the best! Merry Christmas all.
4,Love... Love Joe B. !,The first time I heard Joe I was mesmerized. He is amazing. I love every album. I look forward to listening to him enjoying a glass of scotch. Both yummie.
3,GREAT MUSIC! TERRIBLE PRESSING!,"My second Bonamassa CD...really liked the music. Takes me back to my Jeff Beck days! Unfortunately, last cut, which is killer by the way, is unlistenable due to lousy quality pressing. Keeps cutting out,jumping and actually skipping like an old fashioned LP. Tried on three different CD players...same symptoms on different places of the track. Even returned CD to Amazon but problem persisted! (GREAT RETURN SERVICE, GUYS!)Settled for refund. Oh well maybe some new day yesterday I'll reorder and hope for a new pressing!"
5,Steve Daykin,This is a terrific CD !!...this is the first Bonamassa CD I've heard and I was blown (away)...I'm more partial to live CDs versus studio ones and this really captures the energy and great technical skill of Joe & his band...the standard that I measure CDs by is how many consecutive times it is rotated in my car stereo; this one is now on 8 times & counting !!...I would highly recommend it !!!
4,Interesting,"Dusty had many good songs, perhaps the greatest being ""Son of a Preacher Man."" Some of the other tracks on this set are less memorable, but it's nice to have a box set for devoted fans. She certainly was a great singer."
3,"Three discs, a few good songs.","Springfield was one of the best singers in the White Women Trying To Sound Black category, but her talent outclassed her material on a regular basis, as evidenced by these selections. With the exception of the terrific Burt Bacharach and Carole King numbers, most of the material is third-rate, especially the ersatz soul titles found on disc number one, which are utterly unconvincing in style. I was hoping that Bacharach's ""Wishin' and Hopin'"" was typical of Springfield's early-sixties efforts, but how wrong I was. Cut-rate fidelity abounds on disc one, with the otherwise fine ""I Only Want To Be with You"" sounding like it was recorded inside a diving bell. Apparently, the reissuers were unable to undo the comically bad early-sixties engineering/stereo separation on this, and other, sides. I've heard superior fidelity on thrift-store LPs.I was wishin' and hopin' for something much better. Three stars for Dusty's singing and the handful of fine songs."
4,Excellent Communicator!,"I met Dr. Egolf at a professional conference in Miami and heard him talk about his book. I ordered a copy shortly thereafter through amazon.com and am glad I did. Although I have taught communication courses containing many of the concepts he has in this book, I have never read any author who makes them any more interesting. I highly recommend this book. The information is solid and well-researched. He adds a human touch to his writing, showing the relevance of the various theories and concepts.I primarily teach broadcasting and speech type courses currently. However, if I taught small group communication this is the book I would use as a textbook."
5,Continuing and Concluding with Top-notch Quality,"The second boxed set of 'Slayers' tapes continue the tradition of the first half of the series. The story continues to be tight, the characters remain consistent (despite their screwball comedic antics), and the animation remains of the highest caliber. There are even some unexpected touching moments that serve to heighten the villainy of the main bad guy.Considering the volume of poorly done fantasy that is availalbe in all media, rivaled only by the number of unfunny comedies, 'Slayers' is truly a standout effort. If you have viewed the tapes from the 'Slayers Collectors Set Vols. 1-4,' you owe it to yourself to get the second half of the epic."
2,Agree with others on the new format,"I almost always read reviews before buying, but Santa forgot to get this for my daughter who is almost 3. She has speech delay, and while she can't read yet, I agree that the words should appear with the correct animal (ie. I see a red bird looking at me should appear on the page with the red bird). But I also miss that is does not say ""Mother, Mother...."" it instead says, ""Teacher, Teacher...."" Okay, so a dad could be reading it, and I know some kids don't have a Mother, but, if we are talking about keeping it a classic, then it should stay a classic in that respect too. There are lots of books that are about a father and if I were reading to my child (I am a mother) I'd still read it as father. I think I will write in it to fix it. I have done that with many, many books."
3,This is not the board book,Whoops - read carefully. Hardcover is not the board book. I returned because I need the board book. Overall - great book and you need to get the durable version because you will be reading this one over and over and over....
4,"Simple story with large, bright pictures","This book is such a classic that I knew my daughter had to have it. She is only 4-months old so she doesn't have a great attention span for books just yet, but when I read each animal's page in a different voice and make the sound each animal would make she sticks with it pretty well. I really like it!"
5,"Raffi Sings Brown Bear, Brown Bear","I've downloaded a song that is attributed to Raffi (although you never can tell with third-party downloads) which is this book basically sung to the tune of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. My boyfriend's daughter fell in love with the song before I knew the book existed. Maybe on the nights that you're just too tired to read, the children could look at the book along with the song."
2,"""Missing and Unseen Signs of the Brown Bear""","My grandbaby loves the story of ""Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?""However, the signed story on the DVD to accompany this book is of poor quality. Not only are there noticeable errors on the DVD, it does not accurately follow the story. Many signs are missing for the colors and words that were to be presented in Sign Language. I taught Hearing Impaired kids for 34 years and must say that this DVD is by far the worst I've seen to accompany a written story in Sign Language. It appears to be a signer making a DVD on the spot at the last minute, but ran out of time before the DVD was completed. Rather than taking time to produce a DVD of better quality, a bad copy was distributed anyway without thinking of the purchaser or the child learning to accurately read the book in sign language."
5,"Endearing, engaging and educational!","My 1-year-old simply adores this book! She begs for me to read it to her over and over. I've caught her ""reading"" it to herself countless times. The cadence of the words, as well as the colorful pictures seems magical."
5,A children's classic,"Brown Bear, Brown Bear by Bill Martin Jr. and illustrated by Eric Carle is a classic book for young readers. The REPETITIVE (not rhyming) text is what makes the book easy for little ones to memorize. The book introduces the very young to animal names and color words. The simple, REPETITIVE text encourages even the youngest of readers to chime in. An excellent choice and a must have in your child's library."
5,Great Book for Babies!,"I bought this book for my daughter when she turned one. It's been her favorite book. She knows all the animals, the colors and the sounds each animal makes. If you are looking to buy a perfect baby book, this is it. The pictures are great!"
3,"Beautiful book, but not as captivating as some","If I were rating this book for me, I'd give it five stars. The illustrations are gorgeous, and the concept is really strong. It teaches sequencing as well as color and animal identification. I bought this book for my daughter, who's 2 1/2, because I knew they read it at preschool. However, she has never been particularly interested in having me read it to her. (I have noticed her ""reading"" it to herself a couple of times.) It's a preschool classic, but I'd make sure your child actually likes it before buying a copy for home."
4,Rhyming and captivating!,"I love the rhyming phrases and the visually vibrant colored animals! It's an excellent introductory book for colours, animals and words."
5,Book,I ordered this book for my grand daughter. This is a wonderful book that all children should own. Very repetitive and children can read along with you.
5,My son loves it,"My sons got this when he was 15 month. He loves this book and can mimic the sound of all the animals in this book. I have no idea how he recognizes all these figures. Anyway, it is a colorful book, which can easily attract baby's attention.By the way, for young babies, I would suggest to get board book instead of hard cover version, which is easy to get torn."
5,Good classic,"This is a classic book that teaches children to repeat and learn some of their colors. When the book is published properly, the colors match the words. Sometimes I have seen this book printed a bit off and purple looks like blue - confusing to kids still learning colors. Plus, not all animals in real life are the colors they are in the book."
2,"Great book, poor production","Get the smaller hardcover version. Great book, but this big edition is really not easy to manage and the pages were not aligned so it looks bad."
5,My 10 month old loves this book!,"My 10 month old son absolutely adores this book. We read it every night and it never grows old. We read it once and then go through and make the animal sounds (well, I do anyway). This is a great book to get for a new baby!! The other two in the series (Polar Bear and Panda Bear) are also well loved!"
3,I was not impressed,"Honestly the bear is looking at nothing. Then you turn the page and something appears out of no where and as large as the bear (instead of the bear seeing it far away)... would not the whole point of this book be for the child to point to the object in the distance and name it before turning the page and seeing the answer? Just could have been better. I also did not particularly like the artwork, but that would not have been an issue if the book had been laid out in a useful and teaching manner."
5,Must-have book for kids!,"This is one of my kids' favorite books. The pictures are bright and colorful, and the repetition helps the kids learn the animals and sounds.I purchased this book and ""Polar Bear, Polar Bear"" for my new niece!"
5,"Not just a Story, but a Song too!","Every parent probably knows this story. However I learned it was put to music, namely the music of ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."" So now it's a portable story to sing in the car or on walks. My children love to sing it, and it reinforces memorization, color identification and animals.Try it as a song today, you'll be hooked!"
4,my baby likes it,he smiles at me when i say 'brown bear brown bear what do you see'he loves looking at the pictures and listens carefully to my reading.
4,"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See",This a Wonderfull book for colors. The author uses wonderfull pictures to show the differnet colors. This book taught me the colors.
2,Not a hit!,"I bought this book for my son when he was a toddler. I thought it was a lovely book, however he did not enjoy it at all. It sat on his bookshelf for five years and was read only the once."
4,Fun book and easy to memorize,"A great tool for teaching colors. My toddler loves when we sing the words, which has made it easy to memorize. Now when we are traveling and stuck in traffic, we can ""sing"" the book."
3,Enjoyable,"This is OK for small children, but somehow I was expecting more from this product. Still I had good times with my kid and ""Brown Bear""."
5,Wonderful Book,"My 3 year old daughter has been enjoying this book since she was about 9 months old. We've made the words into a bit of a rap song. She loves the different colors of the animals, (some not found in nature!) and she loves the multi-ethnic kids at the end. Wonderful!"
5,My daughter's favorite book,"My daughter is 2 and she loves this book, it is her favorite. She already knows the name of all the animals in the book. I think is a very educational book and will be buying the others too."
5,Awesome book!,"This book keeps my child's attention from beginning to end. I bought this book because he loves animals, and I was attempting to teach him his colors. He has now learned his colors (with other aids as well) and he can read the book to me (from repetitiveness and pictures). This book gets an A++"
5,brown bear,This book was used to make feel books for the seeing imparied. It was a great hit. Thank you.
2,defective merchandise,"This particular book has an included CD. The CD sleeve was glued upside down to the back cover so that when you open the book it falls out of the book. It is not worth it to me to send the book back to the seller for replacement, but it does sour me on the Amazon experience."
1,Scary,"The author/illustrator of this book has done quite a few other children's books, and my son of 3 years is actually afraid of the pictures in all of them. It teaches colors and recognition of different animals very well, and the colors used are very vibrant and catchy. I love that this book comes in boardbook form, but I am very dissapointed with the illustrations."
1,I see a flop of a book.,I was really disappointed in this book. Especially since I really liked other books by this author. Storytime is my childrens favorite time of the day and this simple repetetive non-rhyming book is never first choice.
2,"Brown Bear, Brown Bear...","I don't understand this book at all. Nothing is ever accomplished. There's just this bear and he sees some stuff. Not too good. Not good at all. This is almost as bad as the book ""goodnight moon."" And by the way Ms. Brown (author of Goodnight Moon) what the hell is mush? Can you tell me that? Or aru too busy studyin at the University of North Dakota? Huh? TELL ME! What is mush?"
5,My Child's Favorite,"I have a 7 year-old son, and this book still remains his favorite book of all time! He started reading it a few years ago, and you would think it was a new experience each time he reads it now. He actually has the book memorized, but loves the illustrations and ""reading"" it to everyone who will listen. I highly recommend this book for all little ones who can read or be read to."
4,A Wonderful Kids' Book!,"This is quite a good book to keep kids engaged. They surely love the colourful illustrations of the birds and animals. Finally to cap it all comes their favourite teacher and a bunch of children mates.My daughter has gone through it so many times that she now knows the birds, animals and colours by heart."
3,Review,"Wanted to collect some books from when I was a child, for my child. Got a great deal. Book is in ok cond"
3,where is the teacher in your book?,I love the book! Why did you change the teacher to a monkey? Please send me the original big book with the teacher in it! Ugh!
5,A classic!,This book is still popular with kids even after 40 years! That's gotta be worth something. Your kids will enjoy this one for years to come and your kid's kids will probably also enjoy it. This version looks great and will be enjoyable for years to come!
5,Baby friendly,"My 16 month old baby loves this book! He doesn't understand the rhymes yet. But, the big, bright & colorful individual pictures for each individual page definitely don't confuse a baby!"
5,1 yr old LOVES this book!,"I'm not sure what it is about this book, but my 13 month old daughter is in love with this book. We read it over and over. It was recommended to me by Amazon and I'm so glad we bought it. Teaches animals, colors, etc."
5,My Son Loves it!!!,"My son got this book for x-mas, right from the beginning at 5 months he would love it when I would say ""brown bear, brown bear what do you see"", now he is six months old and he gets so excited and starts to laugh as soon as he sees the book. It is simple but an adorable book!"
5,A must for any toddlers,"I first borrowed this book from the library. My then 18 month old loved it so much, I bought it. He learned his colors through this book. Easy rhyme is fun for both children and adults. He's now almost 3 year old and this is still one of his favorite book. He memorized the entire book. He loves to pretend reading the book as I point to each word. Now my 18 month old wants the book, and I am thinking of getting another one."
5,Great For First Storytimes,"This book is a great first book to read to baby. The text is rythmic and the illustrations are bold, simplistic, and big enough to attract young babies' attention. My son, at 4 months, enjoys this book."
5,My daughter's favorite!,"I have never written a review for anything on any site. But,I read the amazon.com reviews to help me choose some good board books for my daughter for Christmas so I know these reviews can be helpful. I hope I can convince you to choose this book for your toddler!! It is by far my 13 month-old daughter's favorite book. It is the first one we read each night before she goes to bed. I can read it every night and she doesn't tire of it. The pictures are awesome - very bright and attention grabbing. There are few enough words on each page that you can keep their attention throughout the entire book. It's also long enough that you feel like you've actually read something. It's the kind of book that you can keep interesting by the way you read it (I like to read each character's response in a different voice). It is one of the few board books that was worth what I paid for it. You and your toddler will love it!"
4,cute and simple,"This cute, simple book really sticks with you! It's repetative words, ""brown bear, brown bear what do you see?"" really hold the kids attention. Its simple pictures and simple words are prefect for little ones. It is also a great way to learn animals and colors but much cuter than one of the many color-oriented books out there. I also love that it is a board book so it doesn't get so beat up. I adore this book but a neighbor came over, read it to the kdis, and then said...""What is this? I could write this and draw those pictures!"" Maybe so, but he didn't."
5,A wonderful book for young children!,"Our son got this book before he was 6 months old. It was by far his favorite and he loved it when we made all the noises of the animals as we read it to him. Now he is anxious to share the book with his baby brother. We also add this book to the baby gifts we give to our friends who are new parents! (Polar Bear, Polar Bear is a good book also, but Brown Bear will always be his favorite toddler book.)"
4,good,great stuff.. very simple and fun.. my 17 month old boy loves it! but we need more stimulation! time to move on.
5,Great book for little ones,"I received this in a very timely manner, and it was very well packaged. I love that it is a board book, which is great for durability and little hands. The story itself is one I would consider a classic children's story. It makes great use of visual clues, and word/picture association."
2,Nice book but is not accessible on anything other than the internet!,I mostly do not like this digital edition because it requires you to be connected to the cloud to read it and if your internet is down you are unable to read it on your computer Kindle player. That being said the version on the cloud is nice and looks like the printed book. It needs to be available off the Kindle cloud!!!
5,Brown Bear a Favorite,Brown Bear Brown Bear is a favorite story in my kindergarten class. The children love the easy to remember text and the colorful pictures. The story is excellent and the children especially love to hear this story before nap time. All of the Eric Carle books are wonderful and a must have for any child.
5,Great Book,My 3-year-old loves this book - it's a classic. He loves Polar Bear too - we'll probably get the other two books for our next boy who is only 7 months old right now.
2,Brown Bear Book,"I know this was a ""used book"" but when we got it all of the pages were stuck together. It was very sticky. I was HIGHLY disappointed that the product was sent this way. When I buy used on a book I expect it to have binding issues not like it was put is syrup. I almost bought a few others from the collection, I am glad I did not."
3,A bit longer to read for an infant..,"This book was a gift given to my daughter for Christmas. Although I love the fact that it teaches her colors and animals, I found it too long for her to ""read"". We get halfway through the book and then she looks away and not listen anymore. So I thought I'd only give this 3 stars. I maybe wrong because she is after all only 5 and a half months old. We'll see how she'll do with this book when she's a bit older."
5,"See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil.","If anyone had any doubts as to the relationship between the Saudi royal family and the Bush family, they need to read this book. ""House of Bush, House of Saud"" explores the interconnected relationship of the Saudis and Bushes since the early seventies. It goes through the history of the rise of both Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, which evidently was the result of aid from the United States. ""House of Bush, House of Saud"" is a mixed tale of money, oil, and power that everyone should read. This book is an important history lesson of both the United States and it's dealings with the Middle East, but also how the age of terrorism was born. Most people would rather choose to see what they would like and that is not always the whole picture, so I implore all to read this book and find out for yourself. The evidence is all there, all you have to do is look. Knowledge is power!"
4,"If 51 million dumbasses read this book before election 2004, then...","I wish this book was a mandatory reading for everyone in the United States. Unger details all areas where the Saudi Crown Prince's family is in good with the Bush Klan. He also goes into great depths in outlining the areas where conservatives have no base for blaming Bill Clinton for the country's failure in defending terrorism today. There are several areas where the book gets really boring only because of how much detail is involved. If the 51 million idiots who voted for Bush last year read this book, the United States would be a well-respected nation today."
5,Must read for the informed voter,"House of Bush, House of Saud is a must read for those who are interested in the current political situation. It is well written and well documented. For those who challenge its message, they should note that the book is footnoted almost to the extreme. The editors did a great job of making sure that every statement is documented. And critics should also note that no one has sued the author for false statements.A great read for those who want to rebut people who say that Bush made the right decision about going to war and for a follow up to seeing Farhenheit 911."
3,Nothing Surprising,"Unger makes some intresting connections between the Saudi's and the Bush family, and for that the book is probally worth ready. They key flaw of teh book is that it reveals nothing new. The Saudi Royal family has been connected to every elite group in the world for some time. The fact that wealthy Arabs had oil deals with companies George W. Bush worked for should be neither a surprise nor upsetting. This is how things work in International relations, Large companies, and the worlds elite. There was just as much dealing and favortism towards the House of Saud and the Clinton White House as the Bush white house. The real story here which is gone in to at parts of the book is how bad the house of Saud really is, and there support of terroism both by funding and by fueling the Terrorists. With that in mind the book is probably worth reading but don't expect anything earth shattering"
4,GREAT BOOK VERY HONEST,"AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS I FOUND ONLY 1 NEGATIVE DOESNT LOOK LIKE THE FAR RIGHT HAD ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT.. SO IT MUST BE TRUE AND GOOD. ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THE BOOK ONLY LET ME KNOW THAT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS TRUE IS TRUE AND IT'S TIME TO CHANGE PRESIDENTS.. READ THE BOOK AND SEE HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOUR DONE, AND YOU WONT HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO IN THE NEXT ELECTION YOU WILL KNOWTHANK YOUEND THE WAR STOP LETTING OUR YOUNG 19 AND UP MEN AMND WOMEN GETTING KILLED FOR A POLICY THAT A LOT OF US DON'T AGREE ON..PLEASE BRING THEM HOME NOW NO MORE DEATHS AND BY THE WAY HAS ANYONE SEEN OUR PRESIDENT AT SOMEONE'S FUNERAL? HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF THE COFFINS BEING TAKEN OFF THE PLANE AND SHOWN RESPECT? NOTHING NOTHING COMEO N MR PRESIDENT WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON YOU CAN'T FOOL US IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO"
5,"White House of Bush, White House of Saud","I can't add much to the other reviews already given here, except to say that this is an excellent read and that I highly recommend this book."
1,NO FACTS,this book is a terrible piece of writing. There are plenty of unfactual claims or the author takes a fact and distorts it into being something it is not. The left will LOVE this book because it is what they want to hear. If you actually try to explore where the author claims to cite information from this book you will find it is not there. Ia m not even a Bush supporter but this book is a blatant attack on Bush - and that sends warning signs that this book was written under the blindfold of hate.
1,One star because I can't give it none.,"Evidently the leftists didn't listen to Bob Woodward and others discrediting any ""secret"" deal to lower oil prices before the election. Not true. Do your homework, lefties, and read the book before you write a review. Did it ever occur to you that these authors are producing books for the same reason they say the Arabs are influencing oil prices.....to influence the election? Duh! Huh? Get a brain. Just because there were terrorists on the hijacked plane in no way establishes Saudi Arabia as being a terrorist state, any more than John Walker Lindh joining the terrorists means all Americans are terrorists. These books are rubbish, written to ignorant people who are easily influenced by the Bush bashers. I know our public schools are bad, but I didn't know they graduated such ignoramuses."
5,Well written and thought provoking,"Craig Unger does not write to the fifth grade level that most newspaper editors insist - and most journalist fall into the habit of writing. This book is thoughtful, focused and well written. It doesn't leap to conclusions, but sets out individual facts, notes limitations of making conclusions and still urges the reader to be cautious when looking at the foreign policy of the Bush Administration as well as companies like the Carlyle Group."
4,If this book is true,If this book is true then as Michael Ledeen has written the United States is deliberately not targeting a major source of terror in the world Saudi Arabia. It is in contradiction with its own stated goal of bringing democracy to the Middle East as it is protecting the Saudi Sultans. If this book is true then the US is not as many see it the all - powerful superpower but rather a handicapped dependent nation feeding off its relation with a tyrannical corrupt Saudi regime. If this book is true then not only should every citizen of the United States be worried but mankind as a whole should be - because the war against terror is not going to be won. If this book is truethen the worse has barely begun.
2,"Poor quality - unfortunately, only product for the job","I bought this for my mother about 8 months ago. After the first week, the belt clip broke off it was so cheap. After 4 months, the pager button stopped working well. It got difficult for my mom to press (she has parkinson's). She now has to press it in a certain way to get it to work (the button only works sometimes - less so lately). Now, the pager goes off spontaneously, without the button haven been pressed. Unfortunately, I haven't found anything else on the market that does what we need. I've tried those emergency dialers - but they take too long to ring the phone and are overkill."
5,Best for the price (for fungus gnats),"Not as sticky as some of the really expensive ones, but if you're battling fungus gnats these work well. I tried my own invention with sticky tape, which failed. These work."
3,Tricky traps,"I bought these to trap aphids and other undesirable insects around my vegetable garden, especially my tomato plants. Having purchased similar products in the past I was lured by the quantity (15) for the price. They are a good value but there is a problem with them that I did not experience with previously purchased brands. It is impossible to open and deploy them without getting the sticky stuff all over your hands when you invert them to expose the sticky side. My previous brand had a cover sheet to pull off to expose each side and was stiffer than these are so that when attached to a pole (via the twist tie included)they stood straight out and didn't touch the pole or the plants. The sticky stuff is hard to remove."
1,Does not work,I just installed four of these pads in my home and in 24 hours they have caught one of the dozens of aphids I see flying around my kitchen and living room. I see aphids flying and landing all around them some within less than an inch but nothing seems to be attracting them to the pad. Without this element I feel I am just playing the waiting game hoping some day an aphid will randomly land on one of these pads otherwise I am out of luck.
3,"Needs better distribution of the sticky stuff, but it works.","When opening the product, the sticky adhesive was not evenly distributed to maximize the trapping area on the card. You may need to use some type of spatula to spread out the adhesive so that all areas of the yellow card are covered. After that, the product should work as advertised."
4,Good way to rid plants of critters,I've used these traps before and they do work to rid plants of whiteflies and gnats especially if applied before too big an infestation. Traps work best when stickum has been evenly applied to yellow inside paper--traps last longest when used in an indoor setting where they don't quickly get coated with dust and grit blown by outdoor breezes.
2,Limited results,"I would say the radius for reducing the white fly is about a foot. I stuck it behind my tomato plants and it reduced the white fly on that side, but the front of the plant was still infested."
3,"It works ok, but....",I noticed it did not attract aphids that well and seemed to kill more beneficial insects than the bad ones.....might want to try something else.
4,Good Product,"Lexar cards have always been very reliable. I expected a faster response time with this card, but still good quality."
4,Worked great,"No complaints on the product. Worked beautifully on our 2 week vacation to China. Had no problems and did not seem slow which was nice. Overall, very pleased with the product."
3,OK notebook. Just be gentle.,"This is an ok notebook. I like it because it is very small but it is not try durable. I have carried mine around for about a month and while no pages are falling out, the outside skin is starting to peel."
2,Nice design. Binding broke with two month's of use,"Like so many reviewers, I was extremely happy to find this product. I needed durable notebooks. When I received the Moleskine Small Ruled Notebooks I was very pleased with the design, look, and feel. The paper quality is good. I find it easy to write in.However, after just three months of use the binding began to break on one notebook. It pulled away from the spine and began to tear. Duct tape has saved it for now, but I am disappointed with the durability.The notebook lives in my locker at the gym. The notebook it replaced had been living a similar life for about five years with no such problem (it was a log book designed for outdoor scientific observations, but I couldn't find a replacement on-line).Perhaps I got a lemon, but I do know that the next time I visit a good University book store, I am going to seek out a quality lab notebook.Eric"
2,HC vs. SC,"It's hard to tell the difference from the description. The Moleskin I've been journaling in for the last year has a softish cover so when I went to reorder I selected the soft cover. While it's OK, it doesn't have the resilience on what I now assume is the hard cover. There's not any significant weight or other advantage that I can see so go with the hard cover if you want something that will stand up better - especially if you're going to be traveling with it."
1,Bad Service!,"The moleskine is excellent. But the shipper sent the wrong size, a tiny one i cannot use. The costs of return and exchange make that prohibitive, so i am out too much money and stuck with something IDW."
1,Returning all 16 of them!,"I have never written a review but decided to on this product. I ordered these as gifts for my team at work. The covers are so flimsy that when I put mine in my briefcase it bent the cover. The paper is thin.The review that is titled Best PDA ever must be for the pocket version, not this product."
5,Just as expected...GREAT,"I received this as a Christmas gift from my wife. I'd been looking at them for a long time and decided to drop a hint to her that I wanted one. I couldn't be happier. It's great. Very sturdy, very well made. Love the pocket in the back because I can throw a few business cards in there and be ready to meet with clients. They're worth the money."
2,Not hard enough...,"I love Molskine notebooks, and I love the reporter notebooks... but this one is not my favorite. After buying this one I realized that one of the main reasons that I like the Moleskine reporters is that they are easy to write on pretty much in any situation. Unfortunately, the soft reporter notebook is not as versatile as the original version. It's still high-quality , but not my favorite."
5,Essential items,"I go through three or four of these a year as journals, and I give them as gifts to other people quite regularly. They are the perfect journal-- sturdy covers, archival quality paper, secure binding, a built-in bookmark and a pocket to hold mementos like ticket stubs."
4,Tough call,"Are these journals a Five, or a Three?These journals are truly something special. With the nice, firm cover; lots of pages; a pocket; and elastic to keep them shut, they offer a ton of function for compulsive scribblers.But...they demand a little flexibility from the journalist in return. They don't handle all inks well, and in particular they handle very few fountain pen inks without significant bleed-through.So if one commits to a Moleskine journal, one commits to a pen/ink combination that won't bleed--opening up both sides of the paper--or one resigns oneself to wasting the back half of each page.For those willing to do a little research, though, the pen/ink combinations are out there (fountain pen users should look up Noodler's Black; for Gel roller users, Pilot's G2 refills also work splendidly with Moleskine).If you want a solid, utilitarian journal, it's tough to beat these, especially at a reasonable price--but the bleeding pages will require adjustments. It's up to you."
5,Best Notebook Ever,"I had been looking for an x-large ruled notebook for my grad school writing seminar for awhile now. This notebook is the luxury model of notebooks. The pages are a satisfying weight, the elastic strap snaps just so, and the rules are the perfect width on every page. The cover is durable, and it has a lay-flat binding. There's even a heavyweight folder in the back. This is the nicest notebook I have ever had in my life. I have many Moleskines and I will never go back to using anything else."
4,Warning about page numbers,Just a heads up for those of you who need a specific number of pages in a notebook: Moleskine reports page numbers for their notebooks like you would number the pages of a book instead of normal notebook makers who give you the physical number of pages in the notebook.Just a warning.
4,A great product,"First, I'd just like to correct the person who said that moleskines have ""no actual historical legacy"". The Moleskine company may not have been founded until 1992, but moleskine notebooks have been around since before that. The company is not saying that Hemingway, Picasso and Chatwin used their brand of notebooks, they are saying that those people used moleskines.But the great thing about these notebooks is not that famous people used them, but that they are of great quality. I highly recommend them."
4,The superior traveler's notebook,"There is not a thing I can add which hasn't already been said. My experience is that they hold up better than anything else I've tried. I left a star off on the rating because as some have mentioned, if you write on both sides of the pages, these is a slight bleed through. Otherwise perfect for on-the-go note recording!"
1,doesn't work with fountain pens,"I love the binding, but the strangely sealed cardstock paper of these journals does not play well with fountain pens. Beware!"
4,Really Nice Notebooks,"These are so handy, and very nice, indispensible, and everything else everyone has said. The paper, which is no longer made in France or Italy, but in China, is not quite as nice as it once was. It's not perfect for all fountain pens, but I find that dryer fountain pens tolerate it OK. For the absolute best quality paper available, you have to get either Clairfontaine, or its subsidiary label, Rhodia.Still, these are a joy to use even if the quality isn't as high as Clairfontaine or Rhodia."
3,good prduct,"I've purchased Moleskine products many times over the years. So I don't expect anything different. I like the simple, matter of fact design without the uneccessary add ons many items from other companies seem to have.My only issues this time are, on inside 2 pages, there were small stains. I don't know what it is and how it got there since the notebook was pre-wrapped. That's really nothing. However, this one does have a strong smell when I open it. Don't think I experienced this when I buy planners every year. I'm especially sensitive to smell and this is almost at a bothersome level.I'd give it 5 stars as always if it weren't for this.But all in all, good stuff!Okay I took 1 more star off. The smell is more appalling than I thought. They really need to work on this.I'm wondering if I should leave it outside, opened for a while hoping it would go away. :("
4,"Great notebook, but price needs to take a hit","Let me start off by saying that this is a fine notebook. Sure, as dozens of reviewers have pointed out, the paper could be better. But the construction is second to none. You really get a great product. The only real qualm I have (other than less than stellar binding) is the price. You get a notebook for 10 bucks. Not worth it. Especially when there are companies out there producing almost exactly the same thing (Piccadilly for instance) for four dollars less. Seriously, 40 percent discount on the exact same product. To me, that is the definition of marketing hype. Again, I really have no fault with this notebook. The product itself is fine. But the inflated prices have to be taken into account. I admit, I got one to see if the hype was founded. And, having tried both, I can promise you that it is not. Feel free to waste money on a brand, but if you just want the same quality product, you can go elsewhere to find it."
5,its simple i love this notebook,"I love this notebook is great for everyday use, is elegant and stylish, the color of the leaves adds a touch of sophistication that others do not have."
5,moleskine,moleskin journals are awesome it had plenty of pages to get the job done i love theelastic band that holds the journal closed it has a pocket in the back for papersand a ribbon to mark your place but the best thing about this journal is the pagesthey are acid free and don't smudge much and it has a yellow tint that just makes mewant to write in it more and more by the way i use a pilot g-2 pen with it and itworks very well with it
4,Great For Journaling!,"I purchased two of these books, and I'm contemplating getting a few more. They are very well made, the pages are quality thickness, and are a lovely cream color that's easy on the eyes. The elastic strap that holds the book closed when you're not using it is a great touch, as is the strip bookmark that is sewn into the binding itself. There's also a pocket in the back of the book which I've found very useful for keeping track of my scattered little note cards and half-finished ideas until I get them written down properly. I'm using a Pilot Precise rolling ball pen and I have not had any issues with the ink coming through the pages or smudging. I'm using front and back of the sheets and I haven't experienced the bleed-through that some people mentioned in their reviews. I use these books primarily for personal journal notes and I'm very happy with them. I would recommend them to anyone who wants a quality notebook without spending a small fortune for it."
4,The perfect little idea books...,"I love these journals. I have two small ones for sketching out creative (drawing) ideas and I have the grid ones for fleshing out my writing ideas. I love the little pocket in the back of them and now I am obsessed with finding every kind I can. Apparently you can purchase address books and even a small one to hold photos.I only wish I could find books with more pages. I tend to worry that I will run out of space. In fact, I purchased another (grid-lined) journal because it was thicker (and less expensive), and I was disappointed. The pages started falling out and so I went back to purchase more moleskins. I haven't regretted that decision in the least.I don't care if Hemingway or Picasso did or didn't use this type of journal. It works perfectly for me and I can see that I will likely be buried with one."
3,Ignore the hype,"The paper used can be frustratingly inconsistent. Sometimes they bleed through easily making them hard to read. Its only pencil and ballpens friendly. Gel pens sometimes bleed. If you are a fountain pen lover, make sure you use extra-fine nibs and dilute the ink with water if neccessary. Better still get a fountain pen friendly journal. Moleskines people tells you that their paper are made thin for easy carry. This is a half-truth as they have been having poor quality controls lately. Wait until the current stock clears and buy single piece each time. Otherwise they are perfect."
3,"Great Little Notebook, But Overpriced","This is a great notebook, but I agree with the other reviewer that it is a bit overpriced. IMHO, a fair price would be around $5-$7.That having been said, my hobby is creative writing and I carry it around with me in case I come up with an idea and need to jot it down. I also take it with me to my writing critique group.A regular mini-notebook would probably work just as well, but it wouldn't be as cool."
4,"Very useful, but not as durable as many are saying.","I have just one thing to say about my Moleskine nootbook that isn't praise. It's really not as durable as it seems. The spine of the book has a tendency to separate from the pages, right where the cover and the first page are glued together. Don't carry 'em in your pockets or they will be destroyed."
3,Does the job,"Compared to the hard cover version this is ok. I got the soft cover because I thought it would be easier to carry. I think I prefer the hardcover over this one. The smaller pocket sized soft covers are nice but this size did not work out so well for me. Also, the cover next to the spine bubbled up a little after about a week of use."
5,"The Classic - Don't go for look-alikes, they are not the same...","I love the Moleskine notebooks. Every year I buy a new ruled notebook to journal, tape keepsakes, draw, list up, and record in. This year I'm going with theMoleskine Classic Red Notebook, Ruled Large, but usually I use the classic black.These are tough notebooks. The cover is particularly nice if you live in a humid place, as it's a oilskin material that doesn't mold. I once had a look-alike notebook from another company and the cover molded in 6 months. Moleskines stay nice for years.I love the back inside pocket for holding onto tickets, coupons, business cards - you name it.My favorite part is the elastic strap that keeps your journal closed. I love taking it off and closing it back up with a ""snap"". This is another feature that the imitators can't get right. Their strap gets stretched and looses elasticity. Moleskine's stay nice and tight.Go for the best, go Moleskine."
5,Why didn't I get this sooner?,"This product is truly deserving of the title ""classic."" It's eminently useful and carries well in a shirt or pant pocket. I don't intend to use it for a grocery list--3 x5 note-card works well enough for that. This is for more substantial items: a thoughtful quote, important address, worthwhile idea, etc. One of these little gems is going to find its way into each of my adult daughter's Christmas stockings!"
5,The right size,"This little notebook is large enough to record quite a bit of information, yet small enough to fit in a jacket pocket, or even some shirt pockets. I have used the notebook for a month and am very happy with it."
4,Another great product from Moleskine!,"The front cover gets a little less sturdy after the first few weeks, but overall, I really enjoy the notebook, and I would purchase it again."
3,Love it ... way too expensive,"I love these things, but I go through them so quickly. If you take a lot of notes, and write with a heavy pen (paper is too thin to write on both sides with heavy pen, then you'll be choking up $12 --- as much as $20 depending on size -- every 1-2 months. A lot compared to a marble notebook which functions the same, but without that certain ""thing"" moleskines provide."
5,Great little notebook,I bought this notebook to keep a log of my workouts. I've been using it for a few months and it has held up really well. Very durable.
4,Pretty Good Notebook,"I found this to be a good notebook, but the pages are a little thin. They bleed through with the pens I really like to use, The Uniball Vision Elite (Bold and Micro). Haven't found a better notebook, so I have a hard time giving this one a bad review."
4,I'm not sure what all the fuss is about...,"It's a nice pocket sized notebook but it's not like it's more special than others available at book stores or office supply stores. Nice classic look. Very nice quality paper. The pocket seems a little useless but I've already started putting stuff in it anyway. If I had it to do over again, I probably would have gone with the softer covered version. A little more flexibility when it's actually in the pocket would have been nice (but that's my fault) but if you don't plan to have it in your pants pockets then the hard cover is probably fine."
5,My Favorite Notebook,Use this for school.Will be buying many more of these.Very sturdy. A quality product.Will be looking to see if they make a larger one also. This one is the size of a DVD box.
5,My Journal Notebook,"I was using the plain version of the large hardcover notebook for my journal. However, it was not so comfortable for me to write on blank pages. This is why I've chosen the RULED version. Besides the 240 pages, it has more lines than the other brands so that I can put more text per page, which is also a good thing, like a higher capacity memory. The ""large"" size format is good for me because it fits like a book in my bookshelf. The ""hardcover"" gives it the protection I need for my memories. At last, I like the paper smoothness and quality for fountain pen writing."
4,Great little notebook!,"I love the moleskine line of notebooks. Small enough to take anywhere, the pocket helps me keep track of receipts. It is sturdy,takes a lot of abuse. Never lose a thought as long as you have this little book with you."
4,Love Moleskine--Wish it was bigger,"Great quality, certainly tough, but since I don't need a notebook that's portable, I wish they made one that was bigger (not the Cahier, which is much too thin.)Still, there's nothing like Moleskine, and once you've tried it, you won't go back..."
2,"Paying for the name, not quality","I have used three separate Moleskine journals for light daily use. I typically jot notes to myself, including shopping lists, phone numbers, and other items. They are stored in my pocket or on a nightstand. In spite of light use, each of these journals has suffered from a split in the binding from the cover to the pages themselves. For the price you pay for these jorunals, they should last longer than a few months of light use. To be fair, I've not had much luck with other similar journals of the same size, although they have been three or four dollars cheaper. I'd love to see one of these with a more flexible and durable cover and binding."
1,"It's not large, it's small","I have just received my Moleskine journal and am surprised at the size. This is not what a European would consider to be large. Large is A4, this is A5, therefore small. Very disappointing!"
1,Onother disappointment,Ink bleeds a lot.With less money you can buy a Mead with much better quality paper.I gave it a shot but it did not worked for me at all so......back to my Rhodia again.After 2 pages went to the trash can........Moleskine never again.
2,Don't fall for the hype,"When I purchased the notebook I was expecting a regular sized notebook, one a bit smaller than a five star 1 subject notebook. Instead it is rather small and not worth the 12$ I paid for it. The bindings were damaged on the notebook (pressed in and wrinkled). The paper is rather good quality and the overall look of it is rather professional.All and all I'd suggest going to staples and buying a nice notebook there. That way you can feel the paper and see the overall quality of the notebook."
2,Things Fall Apart,"I've come to rely on Moleskine notebooks for work, personal use, for design mock-ups, and to organize the thoughts in my head. The hard cover ones add weight to a bag, so when I found out about the soft cover version, I was thrilled.That thrill didn't last very long.Because the notebook doesn't lie flat, you have to crack the spine if you want to use the notebook on a flat surface. After doing that once, the cover came off. I tried using library binding glue to reattach my cover, but to no avail; the cover just won't go back on.Not only that, but the back pocket in the soft cover version isn't as sturdy as the pocket in the hardcover editions, and it easily detaches from the back cover.All in all, these are only worthwhile if portability/weight is more important than longevity."
2,Not The Best,The pages fall out and the binding fails after a couple of weeks in your pocket. Get the hard cover.
4,Price vs Quality,"A notebook that is marginally more expensive than a standard notebook of its size but the quality, workmanship and feel of the notebook is vastly better. Its a matter of quality vs quantity..."
5,A really nice notebook,"I got this notebook for daily usage, mostly taking notes at meetings. I don't take long minutes, just key points and action items to transfer later to a digital system. It is really elegant and practical. At first I had some issues with the size, coming from using standard 8 1/2 x 11"" pads before for this purpose, but in fact I now appreciate its lightness and small size. Other users have complained about the paper being too thin and writing from one page being too notorious on the reverse of it, but I tend to use fine point pens and haven't run into this. Thoroughly recommended."
5,Moleskine notebook. Red,"Looks nice, brand known for high quality. Gifted this to a creative producer friend to keep track of her ideas whenever they may come to her."
4,THE Best,I found that my PDA wasn't that useful for me most of the time. Writing things down make a difference. I am a writing so this would make sense. So I got one of these notebooks. I loved it so much that I went out and bought two more. I will continue to use these indefinitely. The price is the only disappointing fact. They are too expensive but no one makes anything similar so what you can you do? I am more traditional - I studied in France and prefer fountain pens as well. So take that into consideration when reading my review!
3,A perfectly adequate notebook line; nothing special.,"After reading about Moleskine notebooks for several months I eagerly bought a three-pack at a local bookstore. First of all, I was disappointed to see, after unwrapping the set, what appeared to be acid burns or some other imperfection on the covers. After using one, I couldn't understand what the big deal was. In my opinion, there are many notebooks that are just as good as if not better than Moleskine. Most are comparable in price. I used to like the similarly priced brands made by French companies, apparently for students, for example, Clairefontane. In addition, the covers of my Moleskines are not particularly sturdy, so after I transfer my notes, I'll probably throw my grungy-looking notebooks in the trash. ""Legendary"" indeed."
3,"""Large"" Moleskine Ruled Notebooks","These were not the LARGE (8.5 x 11) notebooks advertised at Moleskine and in the stores. These were more like 7-8 inches by 5-6 inches. In and of themselves they are the quality one would expect from the company, but disappointing in that the project I had planned must be put off again."
5,Still the standard in journals.....,"Moleskines live up to the hype. The size of the hardcover pocket notebook is perfect, the journal opens flat, the pages are a DREAM to write on, it feels good in the hand.....(and smells great). I'm a firm believer that if you love your writing instruments (both pen and paper), you will write more. A good writing setup inspires and lends focus."
3,Moleskine Ruled Notebook Large,"This is the THIRD Moleskine Ruled Notebook Large I have purchased - I was very confused and not terribly pleased when I discovered that the Large description for THIS Notebook was about 2"" smaller in page sizes - both vertical and horizontal, than the previous 2 notebooks - bummer.I guess that's the way marketing is now happening - reduce the product size and keep the price the same. Pretty deceptive IMHO.I WILL look at other notebooks next time I need one."
1,Stop using toxic chemicals in this product please,"I love these notebooks, but why does the manufacturer use toxic chemicals to make them? It is completely unnecessary. Why injure our health and our environment when there are other non toxic chemicals that could be used for the same cost and effect?"
5,Great Journals,"The designer of these notebooks got them exactly right. The two original sizes, roughly 3x5 and 5x8, fit perfectly in pockets and bags. The cover material is durable yet develops nice character after extended use. The notebook features both a fabric place-keeper and elastic band to keep the book shut. There's also a pocket in the back cover to keep scraps.Try one out - you'll be hooked."
4,Compared to the hard cover version,"I have both the soft and the hard cover versions of this. (This one is the soft cover version. The hard cover version is atMoleskine Ruled Notebook Pocket.)They are both great but I prefer the hardcover. Neither the soft nor the hard cover versions open to lie completely flat as would a wire-bound notebook, making them a little harder to write in when conditions are less than ideal. The hardcover is a little easier to hold in one hand in a way to provide a convenient and solid writing surface.Also, the ""elastic closure"" on the hard cover is a little more substantial. I have more confidence that it will continue to provide a firm closure over time. I think they had to make the elastic on the soft cover a little lighter so as not to deform the soft cover.I therefore give the hard cover five stars and the soft cover (this one) four stars."
5,Very Handy,"Very simple way of keeping things in your head from slipping away. Cover is good, pages are easy to write on and the elastic band keeps the cover shut. When full, will order another."
4,Absolutely the best notebook in the world,"I discovered these little Moleskine notebooks 9 years ago and have never gone back. The hardcover is durable and puts up with a lot of punishment, even getting wet. The elastic band helps keep it closed and i often end up putting things in the book that I don't want to get bent in my purse. The ruled notebooks are nice for keeping track of notes, making lists, writing anything. the thicker drawing books are great quality and at times even better than some of my sketch books. The back pocket is nice for holding things that are too large for your wallet. I've owned many of these books over the years and have never been disappointed."
4,Great for note taking,"This is a quality product that fits perfectly in both a dress shirt pocket or a suit coat pocket. Further, it has a built-in pocket, perfect for keeping receipts or biz cards."
5,Six years and counting...,"I've been using the Moleskin notebooks for about six years now. As a journalist, taking notes is part of the job. When I needed something sturdy, reliable and small, a friend suggested the Moleskin line.Every time I have to buy a knock-off replacement or alternate brand, either because the Moleskins are not in stock or I'm abroad and can't find it, I always regret it. If you're serious about your notes, this brand really is the best you're going to get."
4,GREAT!! GREAT!! GREAT!! 1 small fix needed though,"I cannot count the amount of Moleskine we have around the house, cars, all my purse's must even have one!! The entire family loves these and use them like we drink water!!The only thing i would REALLY recommend though to Moleskine is that the flap in the back where you can place small papers/cards/etc., do be made with a tougher/stronger material because after a few light uses it starts to tear and i have retired a few because of that or just ripped it off and use it without the flap.Either than that its a 5 star!!"
5,Expectations exceeded,What can I say? These notebooks are spectacular. There's a little pouch in the back that can hold loose papers. There's a bookmark. The quality is superb. Anyone looking for a quality notebook should look no further - you have found what you are looking for.
3,1 of 3 lost the back pocket out of my last order,"I bought three of the soft cover notebooks, since I have been going through them pretty quickly. One had the back pocket come unglued from the cover. That's the second one out of the last nine, which is not a good percentage. I keep buying them because I don't have a better alternative - they are the right size and flexible. If you don't care about the pocket, I would recommend the product."
5,helpfull to find fellow Moleskine users!,"What a relief to find other Moleskine Journal users; for me it has been a helpfull resource against forgetfulness, helping me have a very happy life where I do not forget anything and am able to recall the minimal detail after years of it happening.More fancy, usefull, easy to retreive, than a PC, an ipod, a cell phone, or any electronic device to be invented.Extremely elegant to be used with a fine pen.Regards fellow users!"
3,gift,my 22 year old son picked this out because it has a lot of room and is padded for his computer.He will be getting it for Christmas so I can not tell you how he like using it yet. but he has friend who have this one and they like theirs.
5,"Great, sturdy backpack!","This backpack is light, well-cushioned, and well-made. It has especially good zippers; I never have trouble zipping my bag up, even when it's full. The back is padded so that the edges of small items and textbook corners don't jab into your back. It's great for carrying groceries in the city, and books+laptop to work. There are plenty of useful little pockets here and there, and even a scratch-proof iPod pocket. It doesn't bounce on my back when I'm biking, and the straps never cut into my shoulders. The bottom is also reinforced with a sturdier (and waterproof, I think) material, which is great for when you're carrying a heavy load or if you need to set your backpack down on the ground or a bench. On top of all of this, it's also quite compact, so I don't look overwhelmed by the size of my backpack. The dark colors are nice and professional-looking. I would highly recommend it!"
5,Good pick!,This is a good deal for $50.In fact the front color looks more cooler in real than in the picture you see on the web page! Good decent space and also very good cushion on the back.
5,Great Backpack!,"I am very happy with this product, lots of pockets for my accessories, great appearance. No complaints!! I am glad I chose the Targus bag over the competitors."
3,back pack,I am mostly happy with the computer back pack. I did think that the pockets in this were going to be a little bigger then what they are. I would have liked it better if I could carry a little more in the bag. I do have to say it is nice to be able to carry the computer on my back ons not in a breif case type bag. It is nicer both for my hands and arms and also nicer for my back to even my weight on my back insead of one side...
4,Happy with purchase but...,"First of all I would like to start by saying, this is really the first review of anything I have ever left. With that being said, I figured this watch was one that deserved something to be said about. I've had this watch for about 6 months now, and I love the look of the watch, I love basically everything cosmetic about it. I've used Fossil watches in the past, and have always had problems with the band clasp, but with this watch I have never seen any types of issues with it. One of my favorite features of the watch is the kinetic power feature, I've noticed after just a few days of wearing the watch in normal conditions, that the watch was fully charged! Awesome! But my biggest con for this watch would be the face of the watch. I have bumped the watch on walls around the house, and I now noticed 3 or 4 scratches on the face of the watch, and that is disappointing. Other than that it is an all around great watch."
4,Seiko watch 4 stars,"Great watch at a very decent price.Makes a good gift for 15yr old son,Very Happy with style and look.Thanks Amazon for a great deal."
2,Seiko Men's SKA347 Kinetic Watch,"Seiko makes a pretty good watch but I was dissappointed with this one. The crown keeps on popping up and the watch stops. A jacket sleeve cuff or shirt seems to disengage the crown and the watch quits. Beware if you buy this watch, the crown does not have the screw locking feature."
5,One of My Favorites,"I bought this watch in Las Vegas at Dillard's in the Fashion Mall. I looked in almost every store in the mall, and this one was my favorite in my price range.I was looking for a kinetic watch with a stainless steel, silver-tone band and this one fit the bill perfectly. I have many watches and change from watch to watch depending on my tastes at the moment, but I keep coming back to this one. It's a beautiful watch without being too flashy. I work in sales and it's important to convey just the right image. This watch shows class and good taste."
4,A good buy,"Apart from the china band which feels cheap, everything else is as expected! Bought it with $111 so yeap I would say it is worth the price! I got what I paid for and am happy with it so far :)"
5,Seiko Men's SKA347 Kinetic Silver-Tone Watch,I was looking for a black dial watch for quite some time and I found one. It is a very nice watch with an elegant black dial. The hour and minute hands are bold and obvious and the hour markings are also very distinct. It is also a kinetic watch which makes it even better and the price is affordable. Overall it is a perfect Seiko watch. Thank you Amazon for carrying fine watches.Satya
2,Seiko kinetic black face ska347,"Good looking watch and keeps accurate time. Only problem is that the crown pops out daily therefore stopping the time. It is not a screw in crown, it's a pop out crown. Keep this in mine."
4,"Great watch. Dressy looking, works casually, and more importantly works...","I love the idea behind the Seiko Kinetic watches. This one is not obnoxiously big like most guy watches today. It is appropriately sized and looks great. This would be a 5 star watch if in addition to the DAY for a date, it gave the month. I know that you would know what month it is in your head, so it doesnt seem necessary, however, the issue arrives with setting the date. If you dont know what month you are in.. you dont know which day is the one you should be setting it at. So it can get off from time to time.The time keeps beautifully and the charge lasts forever it seems (as long as you wear the watch). For the date, you have to keep going around to find February... then count forward to your month (unless there is a better idea). But a really great watch all in all."
4,Im Loving It !,"This is my first Seiko and im loving it! Suits well on formal and informal attire. Shipping was fast, came in just 3 days! I wish it had day display as well(hence 4 star,4.5 if i had that option). Luminescence last for around 30-35 mins which is ok for me. The weight makes little noise when it rotates but it doesn't matter me so much. I got this Seiko for $110( just b4 thanks giving) for which it is completely worth ! The band can be easily adjust( i used a push pin). No problems so far and i hope i don't get any :P . Oh and the crown is not loose at-all(for me atleast) unless u wear your watch on the cuff. It doesn't come out so easily as mentioned in some other review!"
2,I didn't like the way it was written,"Very likely in the minority on this one, but I really loathed the writing style. It was extremely frustrating to read, and I thought it a very vain, pretentious style. No one writes or talks like this, and the attempt to mimic was a big fail for me. The mother is stupid and very unsympathetic, and I wasn't engaged with any of the characters. I know Peter Carey can write - I really enjoyed Oscar and Lucinda, but this is my least favorite Man Booker prize winning book."
5,Cheering for Australia's Robin Hood,"Carey's sympathetic, first-person account of the much-maligned Australian bank robber and self-proclaimed Robin Hood is haunting and enveloping. I found myself, like Kelly, immersed in the eucalyptus-clad hills of northern Victoria, worrying about who would come riding over the hills to usurp my freedom. I can't recall a book that I was more sorry to see end."
2,is he a hero?,"Who is this Ned Kelly? What relevance does he have to the people of Australia today? Peter... whatever his name is writes an interesting modern fable for the people of that little island of criminals. It imitates a found diary text (are we trying to be TOO confidently literary!?!) and tells of his adventures in stuggling to grow up with an inherited criminality, a transvestite father and (gag) the horrible betrayals of the police. This may be a good book for children (peter partly intended this) but it's not the most sophisticated read."
4,Sometimes it's nice to have an outlaw you can believe in.,"I had never heard of Ned Kelly before reading this book. In no way did that detract from the experience. Mr. Carey allows us to view Ned's world from his eye. He is portrayed as the oppressed Australian everyman who can't catch a break. Not only can't he catch a break, but he seems to be a fairly well established target for friends and foes alike. Well, Ned tries to play along, but as events spin beyond control, Ned takes matters into his own hands.... What follows is a wild ride with a morally conscious outlaw. Ned becomes a hero and a savage, and you will have no trouble cheering him on crime after crime. Trying to figure out what to make of his mother is much more complicated!As other reviewers have noted, the language can be annoying at first. Reading the first couple of pages, I hoped the narration would switch to a more polished style, but it didn't, and I found I didn't mind."
4,Less Grammar Equals More Story,"This is more than a story about a famous outlaw and his adventures. It's a story about the history of Police brutality in Australia. It's a story about the mistreatment of minorities and the underprivileged. This story proves how important narrative history is (even if Carey's book is fiction): the stories of the disposessed must be heard! Please read Ruby Langford's ""Don't Take Your Love to Town""!"
3,Good story but hard to read,"Peter Carey's book won the Booker Prize last year. That's why I picked it up. It's a great story, but Carey wrote it ""authentically"" - as if it were written by Ned Kelly himself. The only problem with that is that, in Ned's own words, he doesn't know how to parse. The lack of punctuation almost drove me crazy. If you can get past that, the story is worth the time."
3,Disappointing...,"This book is not the song of Australia. A better description would be tedious. I read this book to the end because it was a gift from a friend and because I wanted to find out what made the book so good as to win the Booker Prize. I found it a chore to get through and boring to the very last page, despite the setting and surprising twists and turns the plot takes."
4,Very good,"Reading ""True History"" is like driving 100 miles an hour for a few hours straight. Catch your breath at the rest stops and rev up again. The only roadbumps to this invigorating read are the raw vernacular and jagged grammar that stab at you like rusty nails for the first 50 pages but become comfortable once you've made the adjustment.Really a tale about class and social justice, Carey's book satisfies because it delivers us to Ned Kelly's 19th century Australia, where corrupt police and earthy settlers fill the stage in this story about a hard, resounding struggle to right a continuum of wrongs. Tough life."
1,Condition rating was misleading,"I purchased this used from a third-party reseller on Amazon. I did not return this book as it was very inexpensive. However, the condition rating and condition description were misleading at best as it arrived in terrible condition.Also, though it states that its a novel on the cover, I think ""True History of the Kelly Gang"" is a poor and misleading title for a book that is anything but a true story."
1,too many people involved,not my type of reading. not as interesting as the book spoke about.some chapters were not interesting at all.
5,Excellent consistency of voice and character,"Ned Kelly comes from a poor family that gets tagged ""troublemakers."" His father dies after being in prison and leaves Ned's mother with many children which she keeps supplementing despite losing two. Ned puts his mother first, but her main concern is putting food on the table. The book is written by Ned in letters to his unborn daughter. He is illiterate, but intelligent, and after a few pages, his voice is easy to follow. Throughout his story, Ned attempts to tell his side and profess his innocence, but his manuscripts mysteriously disappear, and he remains ""guilty"" to the local police force and on the run. Ned Kelly's story is very well written with consistent voices of believable characters -- a different and unusual tale from Australia's earlier days."
2,"Well...not ENTIRELY terrible, but...","This book is simply a rather boring western. It's not a history book, so you won't learn anything about 19th c. Australia from reading it. It's an interesting use of the vernacular but you will sometimes find yourself reading sentences more than once in order to get the drift. It's basically a lot of whining about being poor, oppressed and Irish - battling against those ... English ...Anyway, I was cruising along, thinking the book was mildly interesting, if a bit slow - then I came to the part about the torture of the horse. Somehow I managed to finish the book after that, although I'm not quite sure how I did it. It wasn't sad or emotionally moving, it was just plain sickening.So, what started out as a ""different"" book eventually became just a typical junky western, which always seems to have either a brutal rape or a scene of incredible cruelty toward an animal. Big surprise. Big disappointment."
2,Don't Bother,"This was simply terrible, a slow drawn out book, literary style was suppose to intrigue you but instead bored the tears out of me. Was not at all like some other Booker Prize winners."
2,Can anyone help?,"I have been reading this book for months but still could not finish it. The reason is very simple. I find it hard to understand and comprehen the writing style in particular the ""grammatic errors"". Could anyone tell me why there are so many deliberate ""grammatical errors"" in this book?"
2,I'll let you in on a little secret...,"Carey's actually not a very good author, and this actually isn't a very good book. If you really feel that you absolutely *MUST* read something about Ned Kelly, then erase those thoughts immediately, because he isn't worth the two bucks of scrap metal that his stupid helmet was made out of. He's no hero. He's just a sauced Irishman with a bad attitude."
4,Rugged and regal account of historical criminals,"This is one of those books which needs a little introduction: in Australia, the Kelly Gang is famous the way that Dillinger or Bonnie and Clyde are in the US. This book shows Peter Carey trying (with much success) to recreate the rugged conditions of Australian life, and it is very well-written in a kind of rough-backcountry slang. It shows how incredibly talented Peter Carey is, and how his talents can be adapted over a wide range of subject matter."
3,"entertaining, but not his best","I found this book very entertaining, but I liked ""Oscar & Lucinda"" better. His prose was not nearly as beautiful & poetic in this book & there was much less literary depth."
5,A wonderment!,"Only an adjectival fool would give this novel less than 5 stars. The comparison to Collected Works of Billy the Kid is apt. I would also compare it (favorably) to Russell Hoban's Riddley Walker and The Book of Ebenezer LePage, two other novels written totally in the main character's true language. Thank you Peter Carey for a novel I'll never forget."
1,I love historical fiction but...,"this was not the book for me. I have never not finished a book until now. I understand Peter Carey's desire to get into Ned Kelly's mind and I appreciate his effort but not the result which is a disjointed, undescriptive narrative. Perhaps Ned could ""see"" what was going on, but unfortunately Carey's readers cannot. The setting and events are not clear and characters are not round. I was very disappointed."
4,Rollicking Fun,"True History of the Kelly Gang is a rollicking adventure based on a true story that perhaps most outside of Australia have never heard of. Carey brings it to us with lively prose from the ""voice"" of Ned Kelly. Ned was a semi-educated, adventurous man and thus his ""voice"" is not in the Queen's English, shall we say. If that is going to annoy you, it is probably best to stay away from this novel. If not, this work is great fun, an entertaining story about a unique individual. This work reminded me, in a way, of Larry McMurtry's western novels. It has the same feel of an untamed, barely governed land filled with semi-legitimate folks. Enjoy."
5,As good a read today as it was in the 60's,"I loved this book when I first read it many years ago, and I just had the pleasure of reading it again. Follow the foibles of Ellen, Kay, and Debbie as they come to terms with the concept of popularity. Written in the first person, Ellen secretly names the trio the ""Unchosen,"" and describes their individual attempts to tackle self improvement. From Ellen's horrifying steak and water diet to her ""romance"" with her mysterious pen pal, Norris, you will find yourself laughing out loud and hoping that she'll ultimately succeed. Kay pulls no punches...rude at times, but always painfully truthful as to the situation of the ""Unchosen,"" and poor Debbie, who will do virtually anything to find romance...this beautifully written book is funny, entertaining, and sometimes sad. It may have been written in the early 60's, but the situations are equally applicable in today's world. Read and enjoy!"
5,A superb evocation,"In prose as graceful as it is unassuming, Mr. Judge recalls a Washington that for many older residents is a beloved, receding memory; a city of neighborhoods and local heros, not just monuments and politicians. His recreation of Baseball's Golden Age could not have been rendered with more insight, humor, pathos or skill. A must-read for any true fan of our lost pastime. Superb. And I'm not just saying that becasue I'm his brother!"
5,A superb evocation,"In prose both graceful and unassuming, Mr. Judge recalls the Washington that all locals know as a beautiful, rapidly receding memory; a city of neighborhoods and people, not simply monuments and politicians. His evocation of the the golden age of baseball could not have been accomplished with more insight, humor, pathos, or skill. A superb read, and a must for every baseball fan. And I'm not just saying that because I'm his brother!Mike Judge"
3,"Where""s the Supremes photos?","I got the book because I understood it was a photo book but I did think there would be photos of Diana Ross with Mary Wilson, Cindy Birdsong, and Flo Ballard.... The Supremes....as America & the world knew them. I realize the Return to Love Supreme tribute tour was canceled but this was because no one wanted to see two unknown SUPREMES. FANS ARE STILL VERY INTERESTED IN The REAL Supremes....So photos of them Should have been included."
5,Coffee Table Book ...The Ultimate!!!!!!!,"Just because it is not a holiday,doesn't mean that we can't send a special friend a copy of:Going Back by Diana Ross.Friends that are ""artsy"", ""shutter-bugs"", or simplyintobeautiful images...will love getting >>> SURPRISED !!!""reach out and touch""with a beautiful book...i wonder if Oprah has a copy?"
1,A Waste of Time,I found this book to be a complete waste of time. The pictures assembled are not in any specific order. There is very little text to read in this book. This is a book for fans only. Save your hard earned money.
5,Diana Ross on how wonderful it is to be Diana Ross.,"Diana Ross is such a visual performer that a book of photographs spanning her career is a very natural collection for her to put together. With the exception of Cher, I've never seen a performer who can look so beautiful and so different seemingly at will. Each photo gives the photographer credit and it reads like a who's who with most of the great photo journalist's taking their turn at capturing a unique quality of Diana's timeless beauty. I never get tired of looking through this beautifully done coffee table pictorical memoir. As the title suggests, this book is all about Diana Ross and is scattered with antidote's and notes from Diana herself. If you're not a Diana Ross devotee then this book probably isn't going to do a thing for you and in that case you'd be better off sticking with her music."
1,Put it Back,"Indeed, this was to be a photo book chronicling her 40 years as a musical star. What the reader gets is a plethora of photos from the early seventies to the mid nineties. Seems Ross forgot about the successful sixties, as well as the latter part of her stalled career (as well as the 'plumper', older Ross we have seen of late) picking and choosing to create her own revised history. For laughs (I hope!) she throws in such gems as: ""All the while that I move forward, I make way for reflection"", ""My parents gave me the right name"", and ""My self said, it is time to cease playing it safe, create new realities, dare adventures, be boss."" It's too bad she listened to herslef."
2,DISSAPOINTING BOOK,"I was very dissapointed with this book, because I thought it was going to be a ""picture book"" of her life and 40plus year career. NOT! Just pictures of HERSELF in the 70's, 80's and 90's. WHERE ARE HER CHILDHOOD PICTURES? FAMILY PHOTOS? THE SUPREMES? Noooothing! I am interested in her incredible life, her sibblings, the early years of the Primettes before they became the incomparable Supremes. Nooooothing! NEVER BEFORE SEEN PICTURES. Again....Nooooothing! Thank God I didn't pay for this book. I got it for Christmas years ago, and it's somewhere in my house collecting dust."
1,Old News Old Pictures,"Skip this book if you've read Randy Taborelli's book, Mary Wilson's book or Nelson George's book. The best pictures are in those books. The pictures in this book are repeats of some of her worst pictures and have all been published somewhere else. The recent pictures show her as fat. Who want's to see a fat Diana Ross? Blurbs are treacly. Not worth the money."
4,Excellent Care for my Pug Dog's Face Wrinkles,"This product was recommended to me by a Vet when my Pug puppy got a minor face infection in between his deeper face wrinkle. The Vet also said it would help with the ""dog zits"" he was getting on his chin. I now use these wipes preventatively about once per week and they work very, very well. It can also be used to clean cuts or ears. The chin zits my dog had are now completely gone. The only complaint I have about this product is the dog hates its medicinal smell and it leaves a nasty feeling on your fingertips after using the wipe."
5,Family movie,"We had seen this movie a while back and it was good to see it again and have a copy. Very interesting . Impact of GrandMothers influence on the inheritance for her family carried out by "" Caroline"""
4,Punk Rock?,"This record is excellent, but have nothing to do with punk rock. It's post-punk related with some of the least agressive of the style ; Pere Ubu, Soft Boys, Smiths. It bring some interesting ideas, but Pere Ubu also have explored similar music in the same era. Television does it with a much more clean sound (it's true) and there is two excellent guitar players in there. But two tracks of the whole album sound a lot like typical 70's rock ; Guiding Light and Prove It. Then, Thorn Curtain sound like a better Pink Floyd. Friction seem to take a riff from a Captain Beefheart track (can't remember the name) which can be a problem if you heard the track. It's excellent, but it does not bring anything new to me or at least it's hard to see what was innovative about this record in 1977. Still sound pretty actual and is excellent!"
5,The only television that eats up my time.,Marquee moon is an album which I can truly enjoy all the way through. I feel blessed to have stumbled across this gem. I rank this album right up there with the best of the best.
2,Kill your TV,"Like a punk version of Yes without synthesizers. Tedious and pretentious. If you're expecting high energy NY punk like the Ramones, Dolls, Heartbreakers, or creative noise and tone poems like VU or Sonic Youth, you'll likely be dissapointed. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ."
1,BeBop Deluxe goes punk....,"I'm going to get some very angry e-mails over this review, but someone has to tell the truth about this album: IT'S TERRIBLE!! I picked up ""Marquee Moon"" because many of the bands I admire played with Television during the CBGB's days, & this album is often referred to as a watershed recording from that period. Upon first listening I wondered if the wrong CD had been put into the packaging, but no such luck! The music on ""Marquee Moon"" has no melody, no rhythm & no hooks. It is as if a bunch of philosophy majors in college read about rock n roll without ever hearing it, bought some instruments & formed a band. The most favorable comparison I can make is a punk Be Bop Deluxe, but that is insulting to Bill Nelson! In short - buyer beware!"
2,This is what all the fuss is about?,"Some of the guitar playing is okay, and there's a decent melody here and there, but basically this band gets lots of critics acclaim because they never had mainstream success. Sometimes the mainstream has the wrong idea, and sometimes the right. The bands from this era and ""scene"" that made it big were all better than Television. This is an incredibly mediocre record, and that's all there is to it. It's big with the name dropping hipster types because they can say, ""oh, you know about Blondie, but TELEVISION was really the best band from the CBGB era/scene!!!"". BULLOCKS!!! Clean out your ears and stop being so pretentious."
1,bad mundane,"IVE always been convinced THAT TELEVISION were REALLY no better than a HIGH SCHOOL SEVENTY PSYCEDELIC, third rate amateaur bar band like AWFULL."
5,The greatest American debut album; a masterpiece,"Quite simply, either you ""get it"" or you don't; but if you don't, I suspect you have one too many Hootie and the Blowfish cds in your collection and not a single Coltrane, Pere Ubu or Captain Beefheart.A timeless one of a kind masterwork."
3,not bad,"this is 8 songs, some of them a little on the boring side. ""Marquee Moon"", laid back as it is, is good, with haunting lyrics. The song ""Friction"" is the most powerful thing here (really one of only 2 rockers in the whole set). The dual guitar work in ""Friction"" is about the best I have ever heard, it sends chills up my spine sometimes. Killer tune. Other than that-it's almost easy listening. It IS a LITLE too rough for the Cheryl Crow market, but not by all that much. This reminds you of what was called ""progressive rock"", as much, no MORE, than punk."
5,#6 of nearly 1000....,"I have decided to write reviews for my top 10 CD's. I have a CD collection approaching 1000, and obviously I am an avid music fan (I call my tastes post-neo-modern alternative). Alas, Tom Verlaine's outfit was too short-lived. On first listen, you wonder... who is that obnoxious lead singer? But after the CD has been played 6 million times, as mine has, you wonder... who is that delectable Mel Torme-sound-alike? Unbelievable CD, really..."
1,Sneaky,"I would like to point out to all potential customers that this is NOT a television. I spent ten minutes trying to get a picture on this, before realizing that it was actually a CD!! Do not be fooled!!"
4,Last Bonus Track,"To offer a stellar review of Marquee Moon would be repetitive and pointless, especially since I'm still fairly new to the genius of this album and am by no means an authority on its merits. It's actually still on repeat in my car stereo, slowly creeping under my skin. There is simply nothing to say that hasn't already been expertly noted within the customer reviews below (and above) this one...But I'll make a notable exception:If for no other reason, listen to the remastered album for the final bonus track, which is listed as ""Untitled Instrumental"" but is so brilliant it needs no name. A gritty fusion of manic ska-guitar, dance-punk pace, and crisp, infectious melody, this song would be corrupted if it were somehow unearthed from secrecy. So I'm telling you about it in hopes that you'll restrict amplified listens to your private time on the road. Warning: watch the speedometer...this is one of those tunes that unconsciously compels you to drive faster."
4,Television - 'Marquee Moon' (Elektra),"Review number 57. Originally released in 1977, as this was the first of three 'actual' Television albums. As most fans might tag this debut offering as new wave or punk, it seems to ME that it's more of a guitar rock effort. If anything, this four piece was a major influence on bands to come along after them like Jeff Buckley, U2, Rapture, Echo&the Bunnymen and Sonic Youth. Tunes here I found to show us just what Television was truly capable of were ""See No Evil"", ""Venus"", the moving title track ""Marquee Moon"" and ""Torn Curtain"". Line-up: Tom Verlane-guitar,keyboards&vocals, Fred Smith-bass&vocals, Richard Lloyd-guitar and Billy Ficca-drums. Likely to draw in fans of Wire, Suicide, XTC and Blondie."
2,What's the big deal?,"Well, I tried this after hearing all of the critics rave. Sorry, but I fail to see what all of the fuss is about. This band desperately needed a better singer. I just can't get past this guy's terrible voice. Great instruments, very lousy singing. A bit too repetitive at times, too, as with the much-too-long ""See No Evil."" Would've been a cool 2:30 minute song -- but it goes on waayyy too long.Another critics' darling bites the dust."
2,Most like it because they're 'supposed' to like it,"This is not a terrible album, but its popularity with music snobs comes from the fact it never gained commercial attention.There are so many bands of this time period and genre that are far superior to Television : Pere Ubu, Talking Heads, Squeeze, etc that are truly good and not riding on the praise of critics"
2,Close but no richard hell,"This is an ok album but the 'revolutionary' sound is definetly no where close to richard hell and the voidoids. The 'saturated' punk guitar sound is also no comparison to robert quines mastery on blank generation. Infact no single member of television can compare to his voidoid counterpart, especially tom verlaine, whos writing, although good compared to popular artists of his time, is still no match for richard hell."
1,Slowest card ever,"Bought this card to use with my Palm Treo 700p. In the past, I have favored Lexar cards due to their speed and reliability. This one is the slowest card I have ever used. Backups that would normally take 2 minutes now take 20 minutes. Replaced it with a SanDisk Ultra 2gb and am now back to normal fast backups. Perhaps this was just a defective card."
5,ROSEANNE!!!!,This is the Creme De Le Creme of Roseanne Halloween. Hours and Hours of your favorite Season......Laugh and look back as you watch the episodes. Good old fashioned fun.
5,get all spooky w/ Roseanne,"Great compendium of episodes; if you like Halloween and you love Roseanne, this is a great buy!"
4,Gotta love Halloween,"The DVD simply contains the Roseanne Halloween episodes...if you love the episodes, you'll love the DVD! No extras that I found, and there is only 7 episodes, even though there were 9 seasons I believe."
4,Its Halloween Roseanne style,There are two shows that treat halloween like a national holiday. The Simpsons (with their Treehouse of Horror) and Roseanne.Roseanne and her family always had fun on Halloween. It was a time for family. In a way that was roseanne and her show was all about. The humor is full of good cheer.These 8 of 9 yearly episodes is an enjoyable feast of halloween cheer. I enjoyed these episodes and laughed whole heartlyBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD
2,Booooring,"This one just didn't have the verve of his past offerings. I loved Pest Control and Organ Grinders, but he's lost something. Wait for paperback."
2,You get what you pay for.Not the same.,"This is the second time I've purchased a pair of these shoes.The first pair made me want for the black ones.The first pair was higher than the second which was a better reason .These shoes look just alike but they don't feel alike.My second pair which were cheaper were wider,just didn't feel they same.Cheaper to keep after shipping.But thanks anyway.Some places take to long to send your things.I don't like that.Amazon is alright.L.W. La."
2,Odd looking in silver,"I bought these sandals based on positive reviews and a good price for Rockports. These are pretty comfortable. But I got them in silver, and man, do they look weird. It looks like I took aluminum foil and covered up a pair of sandals with it. The foil material wraps around the back of the heel of the shoe, and it looks strange to me. Also, the silver color does not seem casual enough to wear with slacks or shorts, but they are pretty flat and would look peculiar with a dress or skirt, I think. I am returning."
3,good purchase,I bought these shoes to wear to shopping and so... They are really comfy and true to size. I gave only 3 stars because when i've ordered them all spec. were for leather shoes and i've got fabric. Anyway it looks good and still comfy. I'd like to change but i'm living in dom.republic... so... i use them as i got.
1,Not what I expected!,Shoe looks great in the picture but is rather strange looking. It is not leather but material and fits too loosely to be comfortable. I found my self walking out of this style and I love Rockports.
2,"Cute, but waay too big!","This sandal was too long and too wide, in addition to being made of a very soft leather that would probably have stretched as I wore it. A dangerous combination for a sandal. I say ""probably"" because I returned it. Cute as it is, it just wasn't worth the risk. If your feet are usually true to size, I suggest purchasing 1/2 size smaller. If they are a little narrow, you should probably pass on this one."
2,Mediocre book on labs -- not a good training reference.,"This book contains general, basic information on laborador retrievers. It leans more toward show labs than the working/field dog and lacks specific details. There are other books published that cover the same information, and so much more. For those interested in field trials and working dogs as opposed to show-labs, I recommend ""The Working Retrievers"" by Tom Quinn."
2,Gameshark ps1,well the Disc looks good...just the only problem i got is this...when i insert the game in..all i get is the audio but no video or anything else.
1,Horrible,this gameshark is the worst there has ever been.you cant input codes to existing gamesyou have to make a new game and then put in your own codesand then you cant boot the gamethis is absolute junkthe manual is no help at allyou can contact madcatzyou cant work with this gamesharkdont buy it
2,Doesn't work with newer systems,"If you or the person you're buying this for has a slim model PS2 this wont work on it, all you'll hear is the sound but you wont be able to see or control anything. I'd advise getting a Pelican Codebreaker over this product as many of the codes from gameshark don't work/cause game malfunctions."
2,my review of blessings from the stars,was ok depending on what you wanted to get out of it. was easy to read and to follow...was a well written book...
2,This watch has satin strap!,"The watch is pretty. I just got it, so I don't know how it's going to work.Be aware that strap is satin, not ""supple black leather"" as says on Amazon (only the inside of the strap is leather). I'm afraid that soon it will require replacement. This is a huge disappointment for me=(. If you're planning to have this watch for everyday use, like I was, then it's not for you. It's a beautiful dress watch though."
3,Disappointed! Not the same quality as Orphen Season 1,"I was quite disappointed in this! First, the artwork is not anywhere near as good as the first season. Secondly, it is more slapstick with very little plot. And I don't especially care for the humor. The characters seem to have regressed from where they were at the end of the first season. So most of the humor seems to be in spats between the characters. And I really didn't find that particularly funny! I much prefer the humor in Ranma, InuYasha, Rune Soldier or even Slayers!The first season Orphen is one of my 5 favorite animes. And I give it a 5 star rating. The second season doesn't even rate 3 stars so far! But it deserves more than 2 stars which is why I gave it 3 stars. I think I would give it about 2.7 or 8 stars. I hope the rest of the season gets better & they come up with a plot! And I wish they would fire the artist!!!"
2,Disapointing,"The orginal Orphen was smart, had an edge, and told a great story. it artwork was excellant, it had great music and was in short one of the 5 best series I have seen.This one needs better art work, much better music, A plot and vision!While parts are funny on a whole a great disapointment"
2,Nice but far to short.,"While Orphen, Spell of the Dragon, tells an interesting story and is well animated my overall impression was kind of disappointing. The DVD contains only 3 episodes, each of about 20 minutes, the rest is opening, end-titling and even the stop/start shots where on TV the commercials are inserted. After the 3 episodes were done they left me with the impression of having seen about 1 episode of a longer anime. So what it inspired in me was a sense of having wasted money, rather than of having seen a nice anime. My advice, don't buy it unless you are an absolute Orphen fan."
1,Theology of Singleness?,"We do need books that encourage us to consider carefully the pursuit of a marriage partner in community. However, the authors' extremely narrow reading of 1. Corinthians 7 (gift of singleness=low sex drive, singleness is NOT a gift but only a trial) made the book a discouragement for this 30 year old Christian currently in a committed relationship looking towards marriage. Also felt like there was a mixed message of setting an extremely high bar--opposed to opposite sex friendships, talk to her pastor or father before a first date--and then wondering why in the world men aren't going into the breach. It's because you've told us we can't develop deep relationships with a gal and we have to bare ourselves to major authority figures before taking a girl out for a coffee. Duh.There are other books out there. I recently read Walter Trobisch's ""I married You"" and found it more helpful."
5,"Edifying, Scripture-centered Help on Dating","I really benefited from this book in terms of how and what to expect while dating and getting our perspectives right. Rick does a good (in fact the right) job of applying the marriage principles in a dating relationship recognizing that the Bible does not speak of dating. I would highly recommend to any couple considering each other irrespective of whether it would go the full-length. Looking forward to reading his book ""The Masculine Mandate"".Blessings!"
5,Enlightening and encouraging. This book presents a wonderfully succinct and accurate view of Biblical dating.,"The core idea that I got out of this book is that for a romantic relationship to work, as it was originally created to work (in the Garden of Eden, each person in the relationship must have Christ as their portion and their cup must be full with Him, THEN each person is free to be a companion rather than a consumer because all their needs are already met in Christ. Incredibly beautiful and simple.Definitely buy this book if you're looking to form a solid position on how to have a God-centered, biblically sound relationship, especially if you're looking for a relationship aimed at marriage."
5,Great Stuff,We made some for my sister in law who is on a gluten free diet and we all loved it. It is al dente and I couldn't tell the difference between this and wheat pasta. I want to buy it again.
5,this book changed my life,"I always thought everybody struggled like I did until I read this book. For the first time in my 37 years of life, things made sense. His struggles, fears and victories were all things I could relate to. It was as if I was looking in a mirror. I took the 71 question quiz at the end of the book and scored high on all but two questions. I always thought dyslexia was the inablility to read because of transposing letters. Now I know it is far more than that. I have purchased a copy for each of my loved ones in hopes they will be able to understand me and my learning disorder. Best of all, I can use Abraham Schmitt as proof that I don't have to stay within the walls of my fear and limitation. I highly recommend this book to every school teacher, everyone who struggles with surmountable odds or fear of any kind, and people like me, who label themselves ""a stupid genius"". Not only is it an eye-opener about dyslexia, but it is an unforgetable story about an unforgetable man."
4,Eureka series,I found this series a little late in season 2 but have loved catching up. It is great to have on DVD
3,Fantastic show,"The three stars is for the this ridiculous half season releases. Battlestar galactic started with this and now others are picking up on it. Half the season at the price of a full season, effectively doubling the cost of a season.Other than the greed of the company...Eureka is one of the best shows currently out on TV. If you haven't seen it, pick up Season one and start there. Its intelligent, funny and well made. (Now saying that it'll be dumbed down to a sitcom level, made boring and the production will spiral down. Too many shows have started out fantastic then been canceled because they were high quality and not low brow stupidity.) Ok, done venting.Eureka is well worth seeing. The show is great and the storylines are interesting."
4,Season 3.5,"I agree that the second half of season 3 was not quite as good as the rest of the series so far, but I disagree with the people complaining about the half season release.Eureka's season 3 was aired over 2 years, going on its mid-season break in September to return in the following July, what Syfy did was release the first half of the season on dvd before it restarted so that viewers could be caught up if they had missed episodes or had forgotten things in the 9 month hiatus. I do not feel that Syfy is being greedy, I think that they were trying to help the fans when the released the first half of season 3."
3,"No labeling, poor packaging","While I admire the eco-sensitive intentions of the package designers I find that the design leaves something to be desired. This goes back to Season 1, when the discs keep falling out. I also take issue with this and 3.5 for not indicating episode title names on either the sleeves, box or disc. That said, I do enjoy the series."
5,Can't wait until 6/29!,"I've been watching Eureka since it started, and became a fan immediately! Colin Ferguson, Salli Richardson-Whitfield, Joe Morton, Jordan Hinson, the cast and crew and everyone involved in the making of this wonderful series are top shelf! 'Nuff said!"
4,A fun tv show,"Eureka is 1 part science fiction, 1 part comedy, and 1 part cop show.As odd as that may sound, it works really well and is just a plain old fun to watch tv show.These days tv shows that are worth watching are very few and very far between, but this is one of the exceptions."
5,Love the show,"With the end of the series, I wanted to go back and relive the show. I like the fact that it has deleted scenes, along with being able to hit ""Play All"" or pick and choose the episodes that I want to watch."
5,Eureka Is Awesome!,LOVE THIS SERIES! I am a big sci-fi fan and I have loved this series since my brother introduced me to it. We are anxious to get the next installment that just came out. The DVD arrived in excellent condition and right on schedule. I will definately use this vendor again in the future.
3,So SO ripped off,"It all should have waited and released at one time in the 3.5 and I could have said bravo! but it was not. so now I have 3.0 and 3.5 Im down double the cash for the season,not to mention repeats of the 3.0. so next time I will check for the whole season."
1,Duplicate of Season 3,"I would not have ordered this DVD if I had realized it was a duplicate of the Season 3 I already own on Amazon Instant Video. It would be helpful if customers could see a description of the episodes covered in a DVD before opening the packaging, as I did, thus rendering the DVD non-returnable. Love the series, but I would rather have spent the money purchasing Season 4, which I did not already own."
5,For once this works,"Being somewhat of a purist about my metal, this type of re-recorded ""greatest hits"" have a tendency to make me cringe at the prospect of what lies in the grooves. Nonetheless, there is nothing even remotely cringe-inducing here. Destruction did this one right-big fat drum, bass, and guitar sound with a nicely polished production helps these old classics shine anew in the darkness of todays metal landscape. Before I decided to write this review, I broke out some of my old Destruction LP's and fired up the turntable. It was comparison time! After a few spins I came to the conclusion that while the old stuff has an undeniable history and cult charm, the new versions flesh out the songs more and make what was once strong even stronger. Many may disagree with my opinion, but the downtuning of Mike's guitar added to the bands newfound 21st century viciousness make this a worthy addition to the Destruction canon."
2,well i can explain the rating,this album is just too produced. they could of taken all the classics and raised the volume making them sound better. they added more layers to the songs which is fine for someone that doesnt know the old tunes. but for someone that has been listening to destruction for years it is just too different. if its not broken dont fix it.
2,Unnecessary,"Yes, Destruction re-recorded some of their older songs. Yes, the production is better, and their new drummer is better. Sorry, it doesn't help. Schmier now sings all down and dirty, bypassing the maniacal shriek he used to deliver. The band now sounds all new-school, and they just sort of lost me...got to give this one a thumbs down. It just sounds like a modern metal band covering old Destruction songs. The charm and identity of the original songs are gone. I used to marvel at how the guitarist was able to play so tightly alongside the old shambling drummer. Not a problem anymore, they now have a rock-solid kit basher in the band. Oddly, that doesn't influence me in a positive way. I think this lineup of Destruction should record new material, not overhaul their classics. Upon hearing this CD and their new style, I didn't even go to their show. This listener recommends that you seek out the original ""Sentence of Death"" and ""Infernal Overkill"" albums instead."
4,"One of Darin's best, although briefest, movie roles","Even though Bobby Darin has only 10-15 minutes of screen time this is one of his best acting. He's just so natural and believable and poignent in this role. And it utilizes his skill with accents.I'm really just rating Darin's performance as I've not bothered to watch the entire movie. :) I only bought it 'cause of Darin.I wish it was out on DVD, but I'm glad to have it in any format."
5,Exciting and Adventerous Book,"If you are looking for a book jam-packed with suspense and adventures, this is definitly the right book for you. There was so much suspense, sometimes I would skip pages. Even though the book fills you in on most of the stuff in Frog Princess and Dragon's Breath, I still recommend reading the first two books as well."
3,Once upon a curse,"I would suggest this book to 7-9 yr olds. At some times, the book got confusing, but overall it was good. I really liked the ending!"
4,What a fun read!,"This book has everything a girl could want to keepherself focused and empowered--whether she's in love, out of love, orjust in between."
4,Anime Fan,I am an Anime Fan and like animes. This is anime so research it with a search engine and if it sounds good then buy it thanks.
1,I agree! Very bad service!,"I too ordered ""Accenti"" by Gucci for women and Macy's also sent ""Hugo"" Boss for men that is only worth half the price of what I paid (which definitely sounded to good to be true at $57.00 ). At the very least they could have made an effort to send a womens cologne of equal value. This order couldn't have been more off if they tried."
5,Gucci -Acceni Perfume,"I love this perfume and wish it wasn't so hard to find, and it's a little expensive. The only thing my husband was upset about it that he bought it for a Christmas Gift and it didn't come in a box. He didn't see that it didn't when he ordered it.I'd recommend this to anyone."
1,Missing parts,"When I order the oil filter the description reads ""Pack of 2"" but I got only one. I don't know anyone can missed that."
5,Trusted filter,"I have used Fram filters for many years on many products. They have consistently given excellent service and have never failed to protect an engines lubrication system. Used on lawn mowers, cars, trucks, tractors, combines, and any thing else that needed oil or air filtration."
5,These images represent two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CD's.,"The images presented here are for two completely different CD's. One is titled, ""Christmas for a New Age"", and has a blue cover with hand-drawn dove. The other is titled, ""Popular Christmas for a New Age"", and has a Christmas tree cover with a dove ornament. Each has different selections. Both are pleasant renditions of popular, well-known Christmas songs. The confusion arises because both are produced by Listener's Choice and both are labeled (by Listener's Choice), ""Volume 6"".I would wish to see each selection listed as it's own, since these are different items."
3,Definitely worth hearing,"This is one of those problematic albums where for every great song, there's one that's the very definition of the word ""FILLER"". Regardless, every song contains absolutely stunning guitar work and interplay - about the best examples in recorded rock, outside of the stones/""layla"" blues-based mode. This album was recorded under extreme duress - the group wasn't getting along, their breakup was imminent, guitarist Richard Lloyd was battling a raging drug habit and at one point was checked into hospital. (A great account of this appears in Legs McNeil's book PLEASE KILL ME) Somehow, though, the music is still able to be at turns joyful, celebratory, wistful, and melancholy. So, yeah, check it out. It's still miles better than most anything else out there."

5,Don't touch that dial!,"I love this album. Some people say Marquee Moon is better, but I don't see it. I think the increased introspection and depth of emotion that we find Verlaine and co. exploring on this album makes it the better of the two. Technically the boys are always in at least as good form as they were on the first LP. ""Days"" alone justifies purchasing this album. Like the rest of Television's (and Verlaine's) output, Adventure is a perfect blend of punk and art rock. While Marquee Moon is excellent, sometimes I feel like that album was too concerned with showing what awesome musicians the members of the band were. Adventure exhibits their musical skill while remaining focused on showcasing what deserves the most focus-the superb songwriting!"
2,What the hell is going on here???????????,"This is another mediocer album from a band that should just call it quits, the lyrics...., i mean i feel embarassed listening to it i cannot see how speed sings them with a straight face! The production is top notch and the guitar players shread, so i have to give it points there, but i cannot like this sloopy mess of a wannabe ""80s thrash album, you want true thrash, then go take a listen to exhorder, overkill, sadus, and or exodus but don't waste your hard earned money on this, there i finally said what i feel about these guys, now you can all go back to soilwork and darkane."
2,Not a flash memory stick,"Warning, this is not a flash memory stick as advertised. It's a mini-hard drive, and like hard drives it has many small moving parts that can fail. Mine died after about six months use, and I know it was a hard drive because I took it apart. When it did work it also tended to get very hot with large file tranfers. While the large 8 Gb capacity was most welcome it came a too high a cost and poor reliability."
3,Nice idea--amateur execution,"I love novels with a sense of place, and to that respect the book is fine. I was tempted to keep a copy of it just for the restaurant recommendations. However, as it is written there were times when I felt I was reading the author's plot outline, not the completed novel. The author lacks the ability to write an action scene. He dispatched something like four people in one paragraph. Dick Francis he is not!"
4,for active programming,"Under the covers of one book, the authors present a coherent view of the various network security packages freely available. The bias is in favour of open source tools, if only because these are free. The book goes deeper than just explaining how to run Nessus or Ettercap or... [etc] Most chapters involve the writing of plug-ins or extensions to those tools. Actually, another criterion for a tool to be covered in this book seems to be if it has precisely this ability to be extended by any competent person (like you).Thus, the book is directed slightly more towards the network programmer than the network sysadmin. Though this is by no means a sharp demarcation, I hasten to add. In fact, you might be a sysadmin dissatisfied with running your current Intrusion Detection System package simply just out of the box. If so, try actively programming plug-ins using this book, to adapt the IDS to your actual network situation."
2,Read the man,Mostly everything in this book has been already covered by widely available and quality papers out there. In most case simply reading the man would be a better source then this book. This is for beginner-to-intermediate skilled security staff.
2,Cassandra Wilson,"A poetry from a very personal view - but it's definitely not Cassandra Wilson, the famous jazz-singer."
3,"Book is good, implementation on Kindle is a bit distracting","The book is a good kids book, my daughters like it. Unfortunately, when it was converted for Kindle, it looks like it was just scanned in directly as images, text and all. The text was then entered again, separately. So, all of the text appears twice. The entered text also generally appears on a separate page from the images. This makes it rather distracting to read. It would have been better if it had either just went with the text in the image files, or cropped the images to leave room for the entered text."
1,"Bayonne, really?","LOL, I was searching for news for black bear sightings in Bayonne (where I currently reside), and came across this in the search results. I'm not reviewing the item, but just wanted to set the record straight: there is no zoo in Bayonne, NJ, and to the best of my knowledge, it is *not* the muffin capital of anyplace, let alone the world!"
1,Beenie Man advocates the killing of gays,"In his music, Beenie Man advocates killing gays. More than30 gays have been killed in Jamaica, where he comes from.His music has lots of influence there. In some cases mobssang his anti-gay songs while they killed a man who might have been gay.When asked to apologize and change his ways he wrote a song about how hewould not apologize. If someone advocated the killingof Blacks or Jews, they would not be tolerated. It seems strangethat in the 21st century the world still tolerates someonewho advocates the killing of gays. I suspect that the worldwould not tolerate this if white men were getting killed.Please don't support him by purchasing his music."
5,Great for a 4 year old.,"I bought this for my son who is 4. He loves it and can operate it whith out any help. Good quality and can take alot of abuse,"
4,Works as Advertised,"We bought one of these for our youngest son's third birthday, and of course we had to by another one for his four year old brother to avoid fighting. I have to say that despite some mixed reviews, it works as advertised. We never had any problems with snaggles, and the hook deployed everytime. I wonder if people were using enough weight on their line? Or had some other problems with their rig? The kids caught three fish between them with these rods, and I caught one while showing them how to use it. Neither my wife nor I caught one with our conventional rods, so perhaps we should consider switching, too..."
1,Piece O' Junk,"Bought this for 5-yr-old for a vacation at the lake. It casts and it's fun to see how far it might go, but that's where all smiles ended. It constantly tangled and the reel kept falling apart. It was a pain to keep fixing and trying to put back together. We spent more time fixing than fishing. We returned it to the store immediately upon return from our vacation. Do yourself a favor and go pick up a $10 theme fishing rod from Walmart that comes with a little tackle box. It will be more enjoyable for everyone."
1,WASTE OF $$ along with A PIECE OF CRAP!!,"I also bought this for my son and it broke within the first 3 hours of using it. It was his first time fishing and he was excited. He launched it and it seemed to be fine but it wouldn't reel back in. Finally after 15 minutes of trying to reeling it back it, we launched it again and it didn't seem to cast out far enough so we tried reeling it back in and it just stopped. Wasting over 1hr on trying to fix the problem, we finally got fed up and just packed up our gear and left. My son was so upset, he cried the whole time wanting to fish. Thanx FOGO for making kids cry and making the parents look idiots. We'll buy a real fishing rod."
1,Don't waste your money like I did.,"I purchased this for my son who loves to fish with his Grandpa after intense lobbying. My son really wanted to be able to cast on his own like the grownups. He was so excited about this product and was devastated that no one - including the grownups could get the necessary items for tackle in the ""pocket"" yet still in a position where a fish could be caught. It does cast - but there is no way to actually catch a fish with it. Don't waste your money.- Taken Parent"
3,Doesn't work very well,"After seeing the commercial on TV my son wanted this really bad. It doesn't really work very well. The bobber where you put your bait doesn't open up very well. I've had to open it up to fix tangled line twice. I like the idea of it though. It makes it easy for younger kids to cast, but it's not really designed for younger kids. Older kids like my 9 year old can cast a regular pole pretty well."
2,Cheap Plastic!!!!,"I bought two for my sons for Christmas 2007. One of them broke on the first try of cocking the gun!!! I tried to fix it but realized that the mechanism was made of cheap plactic which had snapped in half. The other gun has continued to work fine after several outings, however, we still have not caught any fish with these. Mainly because the bullet which holds the hook has a hard time opening, and then doesnt allow the hook, bait, and weight to sink low enough to attract any fish. Dont waste your money - we pulled out a cheap rod from when I was a kid, and my kids actually preferred that!!!"
2,a fishing rod?!!!,"my daughters are 8 years old-this is not an item for them!!! We were all disappointed-we always go fishing, and my girls begged to have these. They shoot out about 20 feet, which is right in front of your feet, and they catch nothing!!! They do better with a rod and reel, and live bait. We have told everyone not to buy them, unless you have children who are 2 years old and want to act like they are fishing-otherwise, not worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,fogo rocket pole,"I couldnt find this item ANY where but Amazon.Its all my Grandson wanted. I asked him after he had been fishing how he liked it- He said"" I dont like it"" I asked why, they arent cheep- He said "" It doesnt soot far enough"" ( OH! & Dylan is 7 yrs. old) Hope this helps~"
2,Huge disappointment,"I wonder how many people actually catch fish with this rod. We bought two of these at 30 bucks a pop. We have twin sons and they were so excited to use these. They shoot fine (about 15 feet...not 30) but the problem is with the capsule (bobber) that holds your bait. It tends to not release the hook that holds the bait. You aren't gonna catch much of anything if your hook is still inside the bobber. I was discussing the rod with a friend and she said her daughters did the same thing. Its a great idea, but it just doesn't work for some reason. I think we will be returning these and getting them a plain old fishing rod. We were out for over 2 hours and no bites. Maybe because they didn't have anything to bite into."
1,Broken in no time,I bought this for my grandson. It took him about three minutes after receiving this to have a problem with the release latch. I was with him and saw he did nothing more then cast and retreive. I think it is a waste of money.
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,I bought this at Wal-Mart for my 4-year-old who LOVES to fish. It's true what the package says and that it's not for children under 8. As hard as he tried he was not able to cast it himself. It requires quite a bit of strength and coordination in order to cast it. And it's heavier than a normal fishing rod so that made it more difficult for him. I still thought I'd hold on to it for a while to give him some time and maybe he'd get better at it but I didn't get the chance. Only after 6-7 casts the darn thing broke. I didn't even ask my husband to see if he could fix it. Back to the store it went; we'll stick to a regular pole and just keep doing the casting for him.
1,Poor design,"Don't buy it. I bought it for my 7-yr-old son. I'm going to return mine after taking it out for the first time. It only casted out a couple times and then started tangling fish line inside, line kept breaking when casting and all kind of fishing line problem. It's impossible to fix. I spent more time trying to fix the casting and fishing line than to actually do fishing. Old fashion fishing rod seems so make sense after all."
2,crap rod instead of rocket,"i bought 2 of these and my kids love them but there to hard for them to use,they dont shoot 30 feet they are luck to go 15 feet.they are yet to get a fish on them, the bobber floats way to low in my opinion it scares the fish.they dont work as easy as they show it to!my kids are 5 & 7!i wish i could resale them for half the price so dont waste your money like i did!"
2,Not so great.,"Well, they looked so cool on TV that I ordered 2 of them and I regret it. It's awkward to get the hook back into the ""rocket"" once the bait is on. I took my son fishing with them and what we ended up doing is not launching them out of the gun/rod. We left the pod open with the bait on the hook and dropped it into the water and let it drift with the current. I've come to find that buying cheesey little rods and reels are simply a waste of money. If you're going to take a little one out fishing, just use your own and let them reel yours in until their big enough to handle a decent set up. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it was a neat IDEA. [...]."
1,Would not recommened,"I purchase 2 of these fishing lines, and my kids where so exicited to get them, but within the 1st day they where both broken and they never even used them. Would not recommened to purchase."
2,Rocket Rod Fishing Pole,My child had a little bit of fun with this fishing rod but it didn't last long. Has plastic gears and if the line gets snagged and breaks it might get tangled up inside and no way to get in it to untangle it. The bobbers are hard to find so order extras for yours. Overall is a great concept but not really made heavy duty for kid play.
1,GARBAGE!!!!!!,I know kids are hard on things but don't you take that into account when you design something for them. I bought three rods (over $[...] total) and each one them broke down within one hour of using them.
1,Complete garbage!,I purchased two of these. One for an eight year old and the other a ten year old. These things are garbage and we actually just gave up exchanging them and they have been sitting in the garage collecting dust ever since. The lines constantly get tangled and they do not stay working for more than a few casts. I would highly suggest that you look at something different for your children.
1,"Piece of junk, Roland Martin, shame on you...","The rod itself feels cheaply made, all plastic, but I guess that's to be expected with a TOY like this. And yes, the safety button is an issue for smaller kids. But the biggest problem comes when the line tangles inside the reel, and believe me, it will happen. Incredibly time consuming to try and resolve the issue to get your child fishing again, and that's IF you can figure out how to make it work. Good/fun concept, horrible execution. You've been warned..."
3,not as good as it sounds,"I was very excited at the concept of such a rod and bought three--one for each of my sons (ages 10-4). however, after trying these, we discovered it was very difficult for even our oldest to set up himself and they kept getting tangled and jammed. we had problems with the hook not releasing when it hit the water too. we took them out on a fishing trip with a group of our friends--I have to give them credit--every child wanted to try this rod, but for the work we had to put into each cast I would honestly just go back to a regular rod. it's a nice novelty item that still needs a little work."
1,Not too good,"Not for fishing...honestly is a piece of junk. Cheap line, shoots short distance and the bobber and hook setup is just not going to attract fish."
1,Pure D Crap,"Got 1 launch from this piece of crap. Thank goodness amazon.com didn't give me any problems returning it. The biggest waste of time and money. Major disappointment giving this ""must have"" to my kids, only to have to return it. Don't waste your time!I had to give it 1 star because it wouldn't let me give it a negative mark...which is what it deserves."
3,Rocket Fishing Rod,"This was a good idea for kids and beginning fishing, but not very durable. Plan on getting replacement bobbers if you are going to use much before moving on to a traditional pole."
3,Got this for my god son.,"I got this watch for my god son he loved it, don't know if he kill it yet but! it was still working the last time i checked (maybe 6 months ago)timex watches are always value for your money."
2,Great sound; horrible FM reception,"Received one as a gift. CD sounds great. MP3 input sounds great..FM reception is terrible. You want it for the radio? --think twice.I tried several amplified antennas, wire. Maybe a roof mountedantenna with coax cable is necessary?Cheap fm stereo boom-box gets MUCH better reception.I had to send it back once as it just ""died"". Replacmentwas 200.00."
3,Its alright to have,"I found this book to be alright. There were some area that I disagreed with but over all, as a student of the word of God I think this book is a good book to have in my collection."
4,GERBER 45200 TOOL KIT,"Just recieved my tool kit today. On Amazon it does not state if it come with a sheath or not. Just to let everyone know that this kit contains a multitool nylon sheath with a small compartment to hold the tool kit, but it is too tight to fit both the tool kit and the Gerber 600 multitlool into the included nylon sheath. The multitool 600 will fit inside the sheath, but it will not close fully on the velcro. Overall the tool kit is very good quality, in black non-reflective finish. On the clamshell package it stated the tool kit is made in China, and the sheath is made in U.S.A., so for the people that is very curious about if Gerber product is made in U.S. or not, now you know before making your purchase. I will purchase this product again, if I ever buy another Gerber multitool to make a set.I will rate this kit a five star, if the sheath that came with the tool kit will close fully for my Gerber 600 multitool. I think this is a quality control issue, or a design issue."
3,Just about the same as the other set I bot.,"I love Gerber Multi-tools. And Leatherman. I bot the tool because I wanted it, and Amazon sucked me in with a great price, and had lost most of the bits from my previous one.I bot two different bit sets. I thot that these two were different, but actually, after inspection after arrival, they turned out to be almost identical. Oh, well. I am sure that I am going to lose a few more. I just put one in the drawer and the other with the tool.I have absolutely no issues with the bits themselves, altho I do not believe that I stuck any of them in my impact driver. The three star rating is because of Amazon's deceptive presentation.......... or my failure to examine these more closely before ordering. But now I know, it could be my fault."
1,not what it looks like,this is no the cutter blades. it is the 10 peice bit set for the multitools. very disapointed!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Barely OK product Crappy warranty,"Watch worked OK while it worked, but stopped reading Heart Rate after just a couple of months. Cost about $50 for the watch, but they want $30 for a warranty repair. I got a new watch with more funtionality than theirs from SportLine for less than $30."
2,Not a good product,"Bought this in May, used it daily and after 2 months it stopped reading my pulse, when it did, it showed my pulse at 200+ beats per minute. Sure that is possible, but not when I am just about to begin my workout. Also, when it reads those high #s, at the end of the session, no matter how long, I always manage to burn 4999 calories. I had a MIO previously, not the same style and that did the same thing also. BEWARE OF THESE MIO HEART RATE WATCHES."
4,Does what it is supposed to do.,"This works exactly as advertised, which is a good thing. Gives you a quick, generally accurate reading on your HR without a band around your body. Generally accurate is why it gets 4 stars, you will occasionally get a weird reading, but re-test and all is well. An overall good product.My 2"
3,Somewhat disappointed,"The fact that you don't need a chest strap is what attracted me to the Mio products to begin with. That is certainly a nice feature, and one to consider. However, the ""beep"" that the watch emits after a successful read is too difficult to hear. Despite the instructions that you should take your heart rate with your hands at a lower height than your heart, I can't hear the beep unless I have the watch up near my ear. My only other issue is that the backlight does not work when the watch is displaying my heart rate after a read. I ususally run at 5:00am, in the dark, so the light would certainly be helpful. I could have lived without the beep if the light worked."
4,Can't beat it,"For the price, just as a watch you can't beat it. I read the reviews and heard a lot about not picking up correctly, but I've been using it at the gym and have been comparing it to the cardio equipment readings and it has been dead on and more reliable. I wanted something that would give me an overall view of my entire workout and more importantly to time my runs and give me a caloric picture. I am satisfied."
3,sporty,"its sporty, looks nice, its big comparing to its kind. the color is beautiful. reads fine if u know what to do."
1,Okay as a watch-terrible as a heart rate monitor,"Don't buy this asa a heart rate monitor. Although I understand this is not an expensive, high end model; it does not perform like it should. It takes 10+ seconds to register if it registers a heart rate at all. Half the time it registers a rate that is so obviously wrong that I stopped using it completely. This is not worth the $."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"I've been through two of these watches in the past 18 months. The first on quit after about a year. MIO took it back and replaced the battery, but kept it for over a month. I bought a second one while waiting for that one to come back. First one lasted another two months then stopped reading heart rate.Second one lasted about 8 months, needed battery replacement three times. Changed the battery again yesterday....now it will read once, then quits. I've ordered a Suunto......."
2,Not a good heart rate monitor,"I purchased this watch based on the decent rating on Amazon. But this watch is very temperamental and frustrating, and I found it very difficult to get an accurate reading most of the time. It might be functional enough for someone wanting to get their resting heart rate sitting down, but I would not recommend this watch to people who want to measure their heart during workouts."
2,Good but...,"I received this as a Christmas gift. It was ordered off amazon and mailed directly from the company to me. The package not only had been opened, the watch inside is not the one ordered or even the one shown on the box. The instruction book was not included. The watch I did receive seems like a good one and works quite nicely. I just expect to get what is ordered, new, and the package to contain what it's suppose to. Despite the fact that I do like the watch I did receive, I doubt I'll ever order or add another Mio product to my wishlist."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this heartrate monitor and I was let down. The monitor only returns a heartrate about 50% of the time when I am in the middle of an intense cardio workout - this is when I need it the most! When I am not working out, the monitor returns a heartrate 100% of the time. This makes the monitor virtually useless to me. It seems to work better when my wife uses it but even she has experienced the same issue. I am back on the market for a monitor w/a chest strap. They may be bulky and somewhat uncomfortable but at least they work."
5,Mio Sport- best item in price range,"I didn't want to spend a ton of money, so this item was perfectly priced. I also did not want to wear one of those straps that go around your chest area. So again this was perfect. I have been using now for over a month- works great. I use it during spin class, step aerobics, etc. Don't really have any complaints about it."
4,EASY TO USE,The MIO SPORT Heart Rate watch is so easy to use that one reading of the instructions and I was ready to go. I bought the watch to use with my treadmill. My treadmill is equipped with a heart rate but I felt the readings were too high. The MIO showed my true readings. Most outstanding is the percentage of heart rate use that the MIO reports. This is much more important than just the heart rate. And you don't have to wear a strap around your chest! The only drawback that I have experienced is the size of the readout. I wear bi-focal glasses and must use them to be able to see the readout.
4,They just work,"Bought these for my wife and two daughters (yup 3 of them). They like them for their workouts and state they work just fine. Functions are good, not too bulky and no chest strap."
4,MioSport Select Heart Rate Watch,"Works reliably, is accurate and keeps good time. So far, so good. We'll see how long it lasts. Has been worth the purchase price thus far."
2,this book misses the point,"i think Susan Sontag is missing the political nature of illness. as far as i'm concerned there is a culture of blaming the victim in our society that is not limited to medicine. the victim is blamed because the victim has little power. the ill person is blamed because the tobacco companies are powerful, the oil companies are powerful, the sugar companies are powerful, the retail chains are powerful, the manufacturers are powerful, the health insurance companies are powerful and the governments are powerful. they have armies of lawyers to defend them; they have armies of doctors, scientists, and psychiatrists to fabricate pseudo-scientific evidence to support their self interest, but the victim is powerless to defend themselves against blame. this isn't about language, it's about politics of money and power. language is only one of the tools that the powerful use to blame the ill, and victims more generally."
2,Poor Susan,"Susan Sontag disparaged the idea that dis-eases are caused by mental states, and her resolutely taking this position illustrates the great and willing blindness of this talented but dis-eased anti-white racist. She had such a beautiful basket of blossoms to offer, and between their leaves and stems crawled poisonous snakes she could not free herself of because she wasn't willing to look in her own basket. Unfortunately her work is forever tainted with her hatred. Sad -"
3,not the book I expected,"I did not find the book very interesting, although it is a great recopilation of different quotes from past books portraying the different views there were from diseases as cancer or TB, that is all it is. There was no relation between one chapter and the next, it felt as if it was just a brainstorm of ideas being put together in no specific order."
3,Messed up by a bone-headed producer,"This album was produced by heavy-metal producer Michael Wagener, and it is obvious he didn't have a clue about who X is and what they should sound like. He tries to produce this album like a Dokken or Motley Crue album. DJ Bonebrake's great drumming gets the heavy-metal thud treatment, and he gets lost in the mix. The guitars sound a lot less edgy, and the whole thing sounds a bit heavy-handed. Having said all that, there is still nothing wrong with the songs included here, many of which are great X classics: ""Burning House Of Love,"" ""What's Wrong With Me?,"" and ""Love Shack"" are all worthy of the purchase price of this CD. I just wish the CD had been produced by Ray Manzarek or someone who really understood the band."
1,WHAT THE HELL!?,"I hate people that say stuff like ""well, real X fans"" or ""the real X fans."" However, I am going to have to say it, the real X fans know that this album SUCKS! It is so over-produced, so pop-heavy, so....awful. The absence of Ray Manzarek is painfully obvious. Look, I saw X numerous times, I own all of their CDs and still worship them. However, this CD does not make the rotation, because it is crap. And I am not saying that all albums suck after the the first four classics. ""See How We Are"" is very good. So, if you feel I am betraying X by bashing this CD, so be it."
1,WTF????,"I have been an X fan for years, but I never listened to this album until recently. I would have given this 0 stars, but that was not an option. Shocking and disturbing is too mild a term to describe what I thought when I heard the studio version of ""Burning House of Love."" I recognized the Billy Zoom power chords, but why anyone would think you need to overdub this with all the cr** I have no clue. Some of these songs are included on the ""Live at the Whiskey-a-Go-Go"" album and sound great, so they were still writing good songs. The production is just not X! Save your money and buy ""Live at the Whiskey.."""
2,"Their worst, but has moments","Arena rock, X style. In other words, a messy contradiction. I love a couple of cuts, but really, do we need ""Burning House of Love""?"
2,What is this garbage?,"Somebody shoot me. The first album by this remarkable band that I ever listened to was the ""X Anthology,"" and I was really fond of the folksy/bluesy style of the demo of ""Burning House of Love"" on that album. So, after I began collecting X's albums I was really looking forward to this recording - ugh. What a mistake. If you're into 80's style ""hard rock"" then you may enjoy this overproduced album, but if you're looking for another ""Los Angeles"" or ""Under the Big Black Sun,"" look elsewhere. I wish I had. The track ""What's Wrong With Me"" salvages this recording from being a 1 star piece of .... I'm so disappointed."
5,Smallville - Season6,"I was skeptical at first whether I should buy this product, but I am glad I did. I really enjoyed it and it was breathtaking. A whole lot of things happen during this season (without revealing anything) Justice League, Lana Lang, and Clark Kent. Loved every episode, especially the black-in-white one. It was really special. I give this product 5 stars, because it truly deserves it."
5,Smallville season 6,"Smallville keeps getting better every season. I love the unaired scenes, and the special features about Green Arrow are terrific."
2,soap opera takes over super hero,"It's apparent that the producers want to keep Lana center stage even at the expense of the supposed starring super hero. Smallville has turned into the Lana and Lex show. The series took a wrong turn the year it prematurely killed off Jonathan Kent. Next, they developed an inane relationship between Martha and Lionel under the approving eyes of Clark. Not to mention -- how are Clark and Louis supposed to meet for the first time at the Daily Planet when they've already lived together in Smallville? This was a terrific show for the first four years, but this last year isn't worth buying. I don't see how the present writers, directors, producers can bring it back on course. They need a new team, one that understands the Superman lore -- one that realizes its job is developing the young hero into a superMAN and not keeping a prominent role for Lana. She was darling, but it's past her time."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS THE OTHER SEASONS,THIS WAS THE FIRST SMALLVILLE SEASON I DIDN'T LIKE.CHLOE HAVING HEALING POWERS AND A MAN FROM KRYPTON WHO USED TO WORK FOR JOR-EL SUDDENLY APPEARS? THIS WAS JUST TOO MUCH.AND FROM THE NEWS OF SEASON 7 IT LOOKS TO GET EVEN WORSE WITH SUPERGIRL APPEARING.THEY HAVE TO BRING HER IN A SHOW ABOUT SUPERMAN.SHEESH!DID THEY GET TOO MANY COMPLAINTS FROM THE FEMINISTS.I BOUGHT THE SMALLVILLE BOXSET FROM CHINA WHICH INCLUDED SEASONS 1 THROUGH 5.I WAS GOING TO WAIT FOR A BOX SET THAT HAD ALL 6 SEASONS.BUT AFTER WATCHING SEASON 6 I WAS HAPPY JUST TO GET SEASONS 1 THROUGH 5 ONLY.THE BOXSET IS FROM CHINA SINCE THE USA DOESNT SELL ALL THE SEASONS IN ONE BOX SET.THEY SELL THEM SEPERATELY FOR GREED.OF COURSE YOU CAN BUY ALL 6 BOX SETS TOGETHER BUT THEY DONT COME ALL IN ONE BOX.ANYWAYS IM DONE WITH SMALLVILLE.
2,Jumped the Shark because of 6,"Too little too late.The Clark/Lana storyline was wiped of all potential after the first season, and mercifully it was brought to a close--- that's about the only positive thing I can say about this season.The Lex/Lana relationship had incredible potential, it shot off, racing for a few episodes and then just stopped. Fell victim to the same mediocrity that is this shows' downfall.I watched this show for 6 years hoping to watch the brilliant fall of a tortured billionaire. I was promised a strong, steady, and a believable fall to darkness.Lex said in either the first or second season that the path to evil isn't a light switch. I was given none of that. We went from a Lex that was open and honest with Lana, distanced from his friendship with Clark to an overnight madman complete with steepled fingers and an evil cackle.It's like the writers realized Smallville's time is coming to a close so they are hastily wrapping it up.Buy it if your a fanboy. If not, don't bother."
3,This season was a major disappointment,"Lets face the truth here, every one hated the whole Lex/Lana bit. It was absolutely an insult not only to our intelligence but to the series of superman as well. As much as there are Lana haters, the show survives on the other 80 percent of viewers that watch for the romance as well. They want Lana and Clark to be together. The writers of the show suck. They are the ones that ruin the Lana character and make her into a moron half the time. Blind, deaf, and dumb Lana walks around like she is oblivious to the world. They stretched the whole, should I tell her thing to way beyond human sanity. Season six was painful to watch and pretty darn dumb at times. The writers should be fired, period."
2,Menu Mess,"When going to a disc menu on the Blue Ray version of the sixth season of Smallville, the only choice is special features of selected scenes. There is no choice to go to a specific episode on a disc.On the HD version the episode titles are numbered with a time and out of order on at least one of the discs. Titles around 42 minutes are episodes. Titles around 25 minutes are special features. Titles around two minutes are deleted scenes.On the regular DVD version the disc menus have named episode choices."
3,Was told it was in good condition but cover was very used,Was told it was in good condition but cover was very used/worn and crinckled. I was not happy with the cover that I should have been told was in this condition.
3,Good but is lacking...,"I loved the first few seasons. With season 4,5 and now 6, this show is lacking the luster it once had. don't get me wrong, it's still a good show but the latter seasons just aren't as good as the first 3. I think it's about to or already has jumped the shark."
5,Smallville - all are superb,"Although I haven't viewed season 6 on DVD yet, I did watch the season on television, so it has to be just as excellent. I own all seasons of Smallville and they are all superb! Smallville is a GEM of a show.Smallville, Prison Break, CBS's Cold Case with Danny Pino and Kathryn Morris and Supernatural are all excellent shows with extremely talented actors and actresses.jimmy"
5,excellent series continues,"This is the best of the Smallville Series since season 2. Leaves you wanting the next series, just to see if they can come up with the goods."
5,Smallville - 6th Season,"Great season! Can't wait for the next one!!!! Just keeps you looking for more! Lot's of exciting things happening... After purchasing this season, you'll definitely look forward to the one's to follow!"
1,lousy,"The item was delivered missing the first disk, i immediately informed amazon to inform about it, and now i am waiting for the replacement to be delivered i hope it comes home complete."
1,DC Comics Characters look terrible in Live Action,"This was the most awful apperance of superheroes in live action ever. Never mind the casting. They all acted wooden and made the kind of acting you see on AS THE WORLD TURNS look like fine art. Then there was the outfits, on the comics page it's colored cartoon underwear, on this show, I will not dignify it with comment, but to say that it's laughable would be too kind.I knew that this show was a joke, but now I am more convinced then ever that this show, as well as the CW network, DC Comics, Warner Brothers and everyone who work there are among the most untalented fools in Hollywood."
4,Lois & Clark & Valentine's Day...LOL...Not a Good Mix!,"What's so great about Smallville is that they include fun, exciting scenes coupled with sad and depressing scenes all in one episode. Makes for good drama. You go up and down in your emotions all within 42 minutes of an epi. I love Lois in this episode. I always enjoy Clark on red kryptonite. This highlights the present and future for Clark in terms of relationships. Dammit...why does love have to be heartbreaking??? I enjoyed this episode."
4,Excellent blu ray but no menu,"I just received my copy in perfect condition. Season 6 is my favorite season and the blu ray transfer is fantastic. The video is flawless and even though the audio is just Dolby digital, it is still brilliant. The downside is that there is no menu, just a simple pop up menu."
5,Awesome!!,"Smallville - The Complete Sixth SeasonBrilliant 6th season, had to watch the entire season within a couple of days!! And that Green Arrow - ooh la la - can't wait for the next season now!!"
4,SMALLVILLE = AWESOMENESS,"i love smallville, and this blu ray is a vast improvement over the hd cable version. the only problem is the dumbed down version that wb gives because they don't want to give blu ray the optimal transfer and simply port the lowest common denominator (hd dvd). there is some digital noise. the lack of uncompressed audio is a dissappointment, but its still great. and i love smallville."
2,Not a Favorite,"I rarely watch this episode because the story is focused on Lana and Lex which I am not a fan of. There's very little that is enjoyable here. We see very little of Clark and he's ""alone"" and ""isolated"" which doesn't make me feel great. I hate seeing an ""isolated"" Clark Kent. It breaks my heart. So...not a favorite of mine."
5,One of the Best - Shouldn't be Missed!,"This is one of the best episodes of Season 6. The opening sequence alone pulls at the heart. The music of Snow Patrol in the background combined with the several scenes of Clark, Lana and Lex as they prepare for the upcoming wedding...breaks the heart. This is one episode that shouldn't be missed.edited 11 Jan 2011. Just saw this again. I can imagine the uproar this episode would have had when it originally aired. It's that powerful. Even now...it breaks my heart. I have to say that this is one of the few times that I actually enjoyed Lana Lang's role. Kristin Kreuk was spot on as was Tom Welling...both of them just broke your heart. This was a great episode. Watch it!"
5,Smallville still going strong...,"Although I have yet to finish season 6, so far I feel it is holding its own with the previous seasons. The episodes are nicely interconnected and are just very addicting. I just can't get enough of it. I will not be sharing any plots, since I highly recommended everyone especially Superman fans to watch Smallville. I have been a big fan of Smallville since its first season, and it hasn't disappointed me yet. However, I am anxious about the last season which I have been hearing would be the 8th season. :("
3,Smallville Season 6,"I think that Clark and Lois should have more on an intertwining story line. If falling in love is where it is going to eventually lead to, then lets get to it already. Lana is played out. I don't understand why they want the audience to invest hope in a relationship that we know is not going to come happen, well that is assuming the shows intention is to follow the real superman saga. Also Tom Welling is the hottest thing on the planet earth!!!Smallville - The Complete Sixth Season"
2,no outtakes or commentaries!!!,WEAK! I have all the episodes on dvr and now my hard drive. why would i want to buy a dvd release for 40 bucks of what i already have? i have been very disapointed as a fan in the last 3 season releases because of no good bomus features. i'll wait until black friday and buy it for 19.99 instead
4,This show got much better this season,"I've always been a Smallville fan, but, let's face it, it's 10% excellent, 40% good, 25% average, and 25% pure junk. That's Seasons 1-5. With this season, I think Heroes must have raised the bar for these folks. Better production, better acting, and better stories and episodes. This season is more like 20% excellent, 70% good, 9% average, 1% junk.Three cheers!!"
4,Smallville - season 6,Very good quality. It is a pleasure to watch Smallville in high definition and without 25 minutes of commercials. CW nees to improve their broadcast. They do not show it in HD and way too many commercials.
5,review,"you guys asked if I am over 13.. is this show for kids?? I am very adult.. and I like this show.. this show is a combination of drama, suspense and action.. I enjoy it.. little different than comic books.. the difference is this guy can not fly yet.. he didn't use his power in public.. only in private.. if you like superhero action.. some suspense.. I recommend to watch this show.."
4,Sixth Season,"I have to say that this isn't the best season of Smallville ever. But I'm a huge fan, so I liked it anyway. The best episodes were Zod, Sneeze, and Combat. Though I was a little disappointed that the fight between Zod and Clark was so short. I think it should've spanned two episodes at least. I like the episode Combat because it was the first time Clark actually put up a fight against someone as strong as he was; before he got his butt kicked.Brandon Simpson"
5,very nice,"The DVD's was excellent, but in the add, says that spoken languages was in also in Spanish , and when I received was in English with subtitles in Spanish."
5,Awesome!,"This is the BEST SEASON EVER! It amazes me how this show just keeps getting BETTER AND BETTER! All of the new characters are wonderful and all of the original characters, except the now dead Johnathan, are still the greatest of all. Does anyone know why Johnathan left the show? He was so good. Of course, the HIGH DEFINITION makes it all the better. Simply superb scenery and graphics. Lana is as beautiful as ever and even Chloe looks wonderful this season. I don't know how they keep coming up with all these great stories; but, they do. I just wish there were other shows that were this good on TV. Nothing else even comes close, in my opinion. And Lex, what a complex and dastardly villion he is becoming..............Clark has his work cut out for him...................It's a bird, (not yet), a plane, (soon?)..............Buy this and I guarantee you'll love it, and lose plenty of sleep like I did, watching it...................over and over..............."
5,I love Smallville,"I love my movie. I can't wait till I own the whole collection, I'm going a little crazy. I'm Smallville obsessed."
4,Smallville,"Another great series from smallville, never get bored watching and it always keeps me wanting more! plain and simple."
5,Thanks,"Thanks for a perfect product from a perfect seller, excellent shipping, everything was perfect. Thank You"
4,smallville: complete sixth season,My dvd arrived with a big cut accross the front of the box like it was cut by a box cutter. I was disappointed because this is part of my collection but I didn't want to go thru the hassles of returning it and waiting for a replacement.
5,Smallville Season 6,This is a wonderful series. Fantastic actors and writing.I recommend it to all my friends and family. Love watching it.
3,Love Smallville,"Fan of Smallville just not this particular season. This was actually the season that I kinda drifted away from the show. I developed ""Lanaitis"""
5,Quick Response,Another Christmas present purchase received with no hassles and in plenty of time for gift giving. Thank you.
5,spoken languaje - only english. very good season,"I like a lot this season, it's very intense.I don't want to give a lot of information, cause it's better that you see by yourself.But things betwen Lana and Clark, and betwen Clark and Lex will make the difference.I enjoy it very much, and I'm looking forward to get the next season in dvd!!!See you!"
2,Not Smallville!,"Ok I have read so many reviews from hardcore fans of Smallville and so many seem to love it! I must say as a fan I was very dissapointed. What I have always loved about smallville is that is a show about a young mans struggle to come to grips with what he must become. Season six is like watching something from the sci fi channel! So many strange things going on with lex creating a super army to the Green Arrow (which is such a letdown superhero, expecally on a show about SUPERMAN) I could hardly follow all the funky twist and turns but I will say the last couple episodes peeked my intrest in watching season seven so I am not quite ready to give up yet!"
5,Excelente servicio,"Soy de Oaxaca, México y quiero decirles que he comprado diversos productos en Amazon y siempre he quedado satisfecho de la compra. La sexta temporada de Smallville es simplemente excepcional; en verdad se las recomiendo."
4,Smallville - The Complete Sixth Season,"Excellent product overall. I'd already collected the first five seasons and was happy to add the sixth. The extras, including deleted scenes and insider information about the filming really make a difference.I do not care for the packaging of the last few seasons. The style of having 2 DVDs on a page and having them overlap is flawed. When I received the package, the first DVD had come loose and was scratched, leaving it unplayable. Amazon's Customer Service Team was GREAT! They sent a replacement overnight, provided me with a postage paid label to return the original, and gave me 30 days to do so. Kudos to Customer Service at Amazon. Thumbs down to whoever designed the packaging for Warner Brothers."
3,"Not a ""basic""","I was disappointed with this toy since I had liked several of the other toys in the brilliant basics line. This toy is not in my opinion a basic as it has all of the music and lights that I didn't want. Also the twisting of the bead bar does limit it's use as a traditional bead bar. However, my 10 month old daughter does like this toy - she mostly just picks it up by the bar and bang it on the floor."
3,Cute but disappointing,"I bought this for my 7 month old daughter thinking it would be like those bead bars you see at the doctors office. Unfortunately this is not quite what we received. The ""beads"" are cute little bug rings but they just don't slide over the bar well. There are also very few positions that the bar can be in where the rings will even slide. The rabbit and bird do keep her attention quite well so I gave it the 3 stars. She may enjoy when she gets older but so far we have not been that impressed."
2,Not a Brilliant toy,"The basics Twistin Bead Bar is an awkward toy. It doesn't twist and bend very efficiently and it parts of the toy that ""move"" to make sounds barely move. My 7 month old only likes it because of the bright colors and patterns on it. I think it was a waste of money. Not a good toy at all."
5,Rebel is Hypnotizing...,Amazing images with awesome electronic music.I put it in the background at my party last week and everyone loved it.And its perfect for setting up the mood if you know what I mean... :)
3,Rebel Moods is Hit and Miss,"When first starting to watch this video, found that it was initially boring and I couldn't wait for each chapter to finish. Once you get to the Panda Chapter, found the rest of the chapters motivating and interesting."
1,"AMOS Rise is excellent, but Rebel is terrible.","AMOS Rise is excellent, so I expected this to be as good. It was awful. Would love to return the two I purchased.Do not waste your money. Hopefully the next AMOS DVD they put out is along the lines of Rise."
2,Partly Happy,"The Movies came in good time and I was happy about that. But, Dovovan's Reef was Flawed on the disc itself. About half way through the movie it would blank out and then jump to another scene. In Harm.s Way was really Great!"
3,Could have been better,"Although a fan of Sharpe, i did not enjoy Sharpe's Prey as much as I enjoyed the rest of the series. I did not like the love story. It seemed tacked on. The main fault was there were no major battles. Perhaps Cornwell wanted the book to be historically accurate. However, some of his best books for example Sharpe's Enemy and Sharpe's Siege are centered around ficticious battles."
5,"""All the perfect ingredients for an action-packed novel","""All the perfect ingredients for an action-packed and page turning read"" as THE TIMES said. This book is for people who like adventures packed with action in the 19th century. This novel is about the time where the battle field was on the sea. Lieutenant Richard Prey an Englishman, is given a mission to stopp war. His adventure is exciting as the plot reaches its climax; Prey has to, protect a women he loves, hunt a traitor and stay alive.This is the first novel i have read if Bernanrd Cornwell. I enjoed reading it becauseit gave me a better view of a Lieutenant on a ship during war. I hope to continue readind the novels of the Sharpe series written by Bernard Cornwell as time allowes."
1,Only about the narrator,Bernard Cornwell is probably the best historical novelist alive today and his Sharpe series is superb. The reason for one star is the fact Patrick Tull is probably the worst reader I have ever had the misfortune to have to listen to. His style appears to be to mumble through sentences and then literally shout every name or 10-15th word. I suspect many folk listen to audiobooks while in the car and it's pure hell to try to understand what this guy is reading. If you turn the volume up enough to hear the mumbles then your eardrums are assaulted by the shouts. If you leave it low enough to hear the shouts then you miss everything else. Avoid this reader if at all possible but do enjoy all of Cornwell's works.
3,Ho Hum,"This is a desciption I never thought I'd be giving one of Cornwell's Sharpe books, but unfortunately it fits.We see only little tastes of Sharpe as himself, We see him in at the dog pits, we see him at the orphanage and we see him with Clouter (one of the better supporting characters.), other than that it just seemed dull.The little tease of Harper and Cooper disapointed me, there was no point of including them if more wasn't going to be done with them.I had little or no knowledge of this battle so this book informed more than entertained. I can't really say if its because after SO many Sharpe books and movies I'm just tired of the series or if it just wasn't written as well as it could be. I'm inclined to the latter since I loved the books in India.If you've never read a book in the Sharpe series you may enjoy this book more since the character will be fresh, however if you are a regular, you will expect better as I did.A Library Book."
5,another great romp,"Stupendous as always, with plenty of depth to Sharpe as we see him again after his great love affair has come to a tragic end. The details about the decmination of Copenhagen are first rate. Excellent suspense and another nice transition from the India novels to the Peninsular ones."
3,Sharpe's Prey: Denmark 1807,"Sharpe is finally back in England. Sadly he is apparently done with the military; reduced to the lowly rank of quartermaster, he has no real hopes anymore, and wanders the streets of London destitute and bored. But then, as this is not much action for Richard Sharpe, serendipity strikes and a deal falls into his lap. He is to deliver a bribe to Copenhagen, and no one is to know. However, when he performs the seemingly simple job, serendipity strikes with a fiercer hand, as Copenhagen is attacked by the French, for Napoleon is planning an invasion and Britain doesn't want it to happen. Sharpe is thrown into the tick of it and, naturally, the fate of the world and the future rests on his shoulders once more.Originally published on April 15th 2002.For over five hundred more book reviews and exclusive author interviews, go to BookBanter ([...])."
3,Even a weak Richard Sharpe book is better than none at all.,"I've been a Richard Sharpe fan since the first PBS broadcasts. I've collected and greatly enjoyed all the books, but this lastest in the series is the weakest. I got the impression that Cornwell wrote this book ""by the numbers"". While all the elements that made the previous Sharpe books so enjoyable are present, nothing jells in the story/plotline to involve you to the extent the other books did. That said, if you are a Richard Sharpe, you should still buy the book. Even a weak Richard Sharpe book is better than none at all."
3,not up to the usual standard,bernard cornwell's sharp series is classic - i have recommended it far and wide - I am glad I have other gems from which to choose when I recommend sharp to friends - this is one of the weakest - the characters are thin as well as the action - the romantic entanglement is just too contrived and convenienthere's hoping the next venture that takes us to portugal is back up to mr. cornwell's standard
2,Not impressed by quality of thread inserts,"I'm not very impressed by this. The handle itself is nice but the thread-inserts are made of low quaility metal. They stripped out quickly and now my handle won't tighten down. I eventually plan on filling the metal, drilling out a hole and rethreading it for my specific application.Between this and a handle made for a specific application, I'd go for the later."
1,Crap that did not work,"I very rarely feel a need to give a product a very poor rating; however, this items was just that crappy. I tried over and over to get it to vacuum debris off the bottom of my aquarium; however, all it did was siphon water and very little debris/ fish waste. Even the siphon was extremely slow. I mean for the price I paid I was not expecting miracles and magical results; I did expect it to vacuum ""clean"" my aquarium. This is pretty much just a siphoning device for water, not a cleaner/vacuum...it is just too weak for that in my honest opinion. I guess I am going to have to buck up and get the sixty-buck aquarium vac again to replace my other one that broke.So buy this if you just need to siphon some water and have the patience to wait while it does that every slowly. If you need a cleaner/vacuum, stay away from this!!!"
4,"Mark Twain is Alive and Well in Galena, Illinois","I first heard this music live in Chicago, where I was lucky enough to witness a miraculous event: Mark Twain singing and telling stories in the persona of Jim Post. What is most amazing about these songs, beyond the beautiful melodies and fine instrumentation, is that Mark Twain wrote many of the words. Somehow, Jim Post carefully reorganized quotes from Twain into song lyrics and then created wonderfully rich melodies to complete the song. Imagine a collaboration with one of America's greatest authors with a rock and roll hall of fame musician and you have Mark Twain and the Laughing River!"
2,Of Little Value,"This guide is fine if you're working with both MLA and APA formatting; but if you're just using APA (or MLA), look elsewhere. Too busy to be of any value."
3,Don't waste money on this resource...,"I purchased this as a quick reference sheet for my high school classroom. Information on it is now available on numerous Web sites [...]. The content for MLA references is now outdated, since MLA has published a new edition. This is okay for the basics, but it is not for a writer who needs assistance in crafting intricate citation references."
4,great help,"Lots of good information, did not have one or two nit picky items.Still a great help if you are writing a research paper etc"
1,Fiesta is a real dud,"As others have mentioned, there is only about 2% Spanish in this DVD.1.5% of this spanish is spoken by non-native speakers.I also don't recommend this dvd for those who want their children to learn the culture - this dvd just about uses every stereotype of the Hispanic culture.The two positives of the dvd are Celia Cruz and Linda Ronstad."
1,Terrible,"I thought that this was a Spanish DVD, as that is where it is listed!!! It's 90% English. Tell people what it is, if your interested in learning a few words to travel with then get this. Otherwise scrap it! Children learn by total immersion, as do adults."
4,It is a real Fiesta,"My kids enjoy watching this video, it is a lot of fun, very entertaining and it is rewarding to see that they learned to count with it..."
5,The most entertaining Sesame Street video I've ever seen.,"My children love this video. My son started watching it at 6 months old, and it holds his attention for the entire time. My two year old daughter enjoys dancing to the music."
5,1 year old and 3 year old love it,Great songs and music! It is a fun introduction to some Spanish words. My 3 year old has learned several Spanish words while having fun watching this video.
2,Disappointed,"I expected it to be in Spanish, which it isn't. So hence the disappointment, but as a general DVD it's OK."
2,Not what i expected,"I guess i had to read the fine print. I thought i was buying a spanish video, since the title is in fact a spanish word. And yet a received a bilingual dvd. For future reference i now know to look for the ""plaza sesamo"" word on the top corner instead of ""sesame street""..."
4,It's Fun!!,"This video is great! It has Celia Cruz singing in Spanish & English and it has one of my daughter's favorite skits/songs ""Amigo!"" The video is entirely bilingual and has some of the cast members from Sesame Street- like Elmo & Maria. The only downside is that it is only 30 minutes long! Overall, I loved it."
4,good dvd for the price,"delivery took little to long like more than tree weeks, brand new, last only about 1/2 hour but my som he still loves more 123 from sesame street"
2,Very little Spanish,"It's almost entirely in English and shouldn't be marketed in the Spanish category. The video is harmless enough, I suppose, but why have Celia Cruz singing in English? It's more of an exposure to some of the most well-known Latin American celebrations than a language video. It may be good as a gift to parents who freak out if they hear a ""foreign"" language being spoken without everything repeated in English."
4,Decent video!,"I bought this video thinking that it would be only in Spanish and would only frustrate my English speaking children, but I was wrong. It is actually mostly in English, and they sing Spanish songs and teach Spanish words. It's been very helpful with teaching my 5 year old new words and my 9 month old also loves the colors and songs. I think it'll be great for him too, just learning any language at all, to have that right alongside his English language learning. I recommend this video, it's very cute."
2,Mostly English,"This video is fun to watch. My 13m really enjoys it. However, my purpose was to expose him to Spanish. Unfortunately, this video is about 90% Engish and 10% Spanish; so I was disappointed."
4,The Golden Ashtray,"I feel like I should print the title in an antique gold leaf because this ashtray is not your run of the mill utensil used for ashes and cigarette butts, but a work of art. In an unusual way, it plays a part in the story.I'm so glad I read this book even though it's not my usual genre. I would have hated to have missed the story of this woman, her family and friends.Sandra is sometimes wise and other times not. She has strength of character, yet at times she makes bad choices. In other words, she's very human.I enjoyed following Sandra through her trials and triumphs. At times I cheered her on, but by the next chapter I might find myself giving her advise (silently of course) like a favorite aunt.This read was not time wasted, it was well spent.Lia"
5,"I finished the book, and it still helps.","I bought the book last week, and have to say, it has saved me money, but the best part, was when I emailed the author on a question I had, He treated my question with respect, and answered within a few days. I think authors should always offer assistance aside from their books, be behind their work, and Alexander has it on the mark."
4,Every person who has a credit card should read this book!,"I wish I had read this book 10 years ago. I really liked the way the author put forth, in plain language, what I could do to get out of credit card debt. Organization is key and so is reading the fine print on the back of your credit card statement. I thought that the charts in the book were a bit too complicated for my taste and that the simple notebook approach with a page for each credit card, worked better for me."
5,"Love, love, love",My two sons (age 4 & 6) loved this movie and just couldn't get enough of them. In the last three weeks they have wathched this movie atlest 25+ times.
3,The movie I hate to love,"Barbarella is not lacking neat ideas and an insanely sexy leading lady. But it falls short when you start to consider the soundtrack, science and scripting.You may notice yourself losing interest in the film about halfway through, not initially realizing that it's probably because Jane's no longer the focal point, the music really starts kicking you in the face, and the mass of odd ideas presented here begin running together and don't make complete sense.Still, this film is a quirky one worth experiencing at least once. Even if you don't enjoy it, as has been the case with most women I know, it is still rather unforgettable and serves as an ample conversation topic.A strange, sexy, and yet jumbled viewing experience; Barbarella doesn't come close to hitting a home run, but she looks better than most while trying. This is semi-softcore meets sci-fi; so bad that it's almost good."
3,Barbarella: Queen of the Galaxy,"Jane Fonda's transition from innocence to experience---a documentary of the anti-culture doing its thing. It is Fonda showing daddy and the Hollywood establishment that she is a big girl and will take pleasure where she finds it. As Queen of the Galaxy, she does just that. Durand-Durand is the actor who played Friar Lawrence in Romeo and Juliet. He tries to kill Barbarella with ecstasy only to have his machine shorted out by this insatiable woman. I saw Barbarella at a drive-in. I was drunk and had to watch it again years later. It was directed by Roger Vadim. Fonda and Vadim married and had a daughter."
5,For Dad,This was a gift for my dad. He had been looking for this movie all over and couldn't find it. I'm so glad to have been able to get it for him. The shipping was extremely fast.
1,BRAINLESS DREK,"Simply put, this movie is a waste of time. It is self-indulgent sixties nonsense produced by movie-makers with too much hubris and not enough sense."
1,Bad SciFi,I bought the VHS version of the movie long before I entered the Army. To give a short review of the movie it is just a crappy soft core porn video with bad acting and horrid special effects. It is easy to see why Jane Fonda never did anything better with her career. If you want soft core scifi porn get emanuelle(sp?) in space. Then I learned of how she acted during the Vietnam War. I hate to think I financially supported this women after what she did.
2,Great chance to see Jane Fonda make a complete fool of herself,Great chance to see Jane Fonda make a real fool of herself .. she should have kept making this type of E grade movie instead of going to Viet Nam and making a complete fool of the entirety of America.
2,Jane Fonda,"In the year 40,000 she lands while traveling through space. She vanquishes robots & monsters. Outside of a couple very brief nude scenes I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Jane's a joke,having a producer husband is not a guarantee of a good career move. This movie is mostly for Jane Fonda fans.
3,"NO ""plot,"" but that first scene...","I'll never be politically correct. DEAL with it. But I purchased Barbarella for the space ship/shag carpet/striptease, and...well, I've wasted money on other things before."
4,Barbarella,"Unless your into the kitchy, sexist period, this may not appeal 2 all. I enjoyed it because it was so over the top. Jane Fonda, obviously still learning her craft, didn't have a lot of range. She mostly just showed off her body in a new outfit, almost, every new scene. The storyline was laughable, but for all you Music fans, this is were Duran Duran got their name from. As long as you don't take it seriously, it is very campy."
4,"Peace, Love and Understanding","This 1968 Sci-Fi movie - based on the adult (French) comic, Barbarella, by Jean-Claude Forest - is a hilarious romp for Jane Fonda (Barbarella) in a journey that is truly out of this world.Set in the 40th Century - and seemingly a time where psychedelic ""blob"" patterns are really cool - Barbarella is on a journey from Earth to the planet SoGo to locate the famous Dr. Durand Durand (Milo O'Shea). The mission penetrates deeply into Barbarella; she has ""contact"" with a human resident on SoGo, meets and greets an angel, Pygar (John Phillip Law), and has an incredible experience with the Excessive Machine.The tongue-in-cheek fun has propelled the movie into the galaxy of cult classics, with an orbit that defies time."
3,Not as good as I remember,Still a classic. Won't watch it as much as we thought. Wish I had watched it on cable before buying it.
1,Acting 101,They all should have failed that class. Looking for a camp si-fi movie and felt assalted by bad script and acting.
1,Oi,"Set back in the time when objectifying women was normal in the movies, Jane Fonda represents a heroine who can think. I was not able to watch the entire movie because it was so cheesy. I wish I could have watched it through"
5,"Move over, Plan 9! Here is the true camp classic.","This movie is so irredeemably awful that I almost couldn't bear to watch it three times. If you have ever watched Plan 9 from Outer Space, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, or MST3K, you are in for a treat.Imagine a distant future in which the universe is run according to a campy combination of 1960's political correctness and 1960's masturbatory fantasies. Now imagine Jane Fonda as Barbarella, rocketing through this universe in her groovy shag-carpeted spaceship, getting into all kinds of scrapes and rewarding the men who save her in her own special way. Just remember that this is eye- and brain-candy; if you try to make sense of any of it, the Matmos will suck your brain out.This is especially a must-have if you want to see Jane Fonda taken down a notch, and what sentient being doesn't?"
4,Jane Fonda was the BEST SEX KITTEN EVER!!!,"This otherwise terrible movie was SAVED by Jane's wonderful performance! From that opening sequence, a very hot space strip tease, to her near-dalliance with the black queen (Note to producers: I'd have given this one FIVE STARS if she and the black queen had actually made out!), this one was Jane Fonda at her erotic best! Why, oh why did she have to go all wacko-radical on us during this period when she looked so darn GOOD?!! I'll never forgive Hanoi for taking her away from us, those BASTARDS!!!"
4,de laurentiis strikes again!,"Another camp Dino De Laurentiis comic re-make of the famous french comic - a forerunner to his re-make of 'Flash Gordon'. ""Brian Blessed as an angel - I don't think so"". Maestro Brell (NZPS) END"
2,Two stars for the title sequence,"The zero gravity spacesuit striptease in the opening title is the best thing about this film. The rest is pure camp, but it's so bad it's not even bad enough to be funny. The plot, dialogue, acting, sets, special effects, and music are all horribly bad and boring. The most memorable line is, ""An angel doesn't make love, he is love."" But let me tell you, that angel was making plenty of love; unfortunately we never got to see any of it. Watching this movie now, I can see that the only reason it created such a stir in 1968 was because it snuck in soft porn to mainstream theaters. But this film is droll French humor; it has no morals or heart and as such is not a reflection of the ""free love"" and liberation of the times. What's worse, even the villains in this film are absurd and boring. If I need a fix of bad science fiction, I'd rather watch The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes."
3,"If you're straight or a Jane Fonda fan, you might want to buy this",A bizarre bit of fantasy/sci fi with some elements of entertainment but the movie is unique. Jane Fonda as the chick she was originally noted to be. Funny how cinema always chooses to portray an attractive man with little clothing as feminine and hairless referring to the male angel in the movie.
3,Campy but fun!!!,"Everyone, this is the what Jane Fonda looked like before she became an actress, and before ""Monster-In-Law!!!"" Great clothes by the designer Paco Rabanne, horrible special effects, a blind, flying angel, a kinky dame in black leather, silly dialog. What more could you ask for!!!!! Campy, but fun!!"
3,60's Sci-Fi satire at its best,"If you're in your late forties or early fifties, you'll remember the really campy movies put out when you were a teenager. If you love(d) Jane Fonda as much as I did, this is a rare treat where you actually catch a glimpse of her beautiful body. The story is camp, the actors are camp, the props are camp, the effects are camp... If you love camp, this is it."
4,Midnight heroine,"Jane Fonda, dressed in unique fashion by Paco Rabanne, is the perfect choice for Barbarella, a 41st-century heroine in a psychedelic, sexually charged galaxy. Fonda is sexiest as ever, directed by the poignantly hot-minded Roger Vadim. The movie is not more (and not less) than a camp classic and the ideal film for all those who enjoy midnight movie sessions. The dialogue is often so nonsensical that results more hilarious than much comedies. The movie is not exactly good in terms of artistic quality, but it's a must-see. The pulpy characters and the colorful, poppy production design are absolutely unforgettable. Don't miss blind angel Pygar (hunky blonde John Philip Law)'s recurrent quote, when Anita Pallenberg disturbs him: ""An angel doesn't make love; an angel is love"". A treat."
5,Glorious in every way,"This movie is perhaps one of the best movies I have ever seen. The fashion, the decor, the brilliant dialogue, the inuendo. Must see. Leave your feminist high horse, and sit back and enjoy the epic saga. It's so 'Warhol does the velvet underground.'"
3,Barb good and bad,"Nobody would remember this flick if not for Jane Fonda. Silly story and cheap effects but Jane creates a memorible character. Kinda sexy , too."
4,"Fantastic!!! My Pretty, Pretty",Great movie from the biting dolls of the lake to the nasty matmoss. A classic that all Sci-Fi ers that don't attend Trek conventions would love. I must adjust my tongue box.
4,Pretty Pretty....,"I love this movie. Maybe it's because it seemed so risque as a kid, or maybe it's because Jane hates it. Whatever, it's great fun. Sure the script leaves much to be desired. And yea, the special effects suck. It was 1968, what do you want? But that only adds to its charm. It's a funny movie, more on the silly side. This is true camp and if you like campy flicks, this one has to be in your collection."
3,Expired Cheese,"I think ""Barbarella"" is best appreciated at a midnight showing with people shouting rude things at the screen. The flick is undermined by the lunkheaded direction of Roger Vadim. Did anybody explain to this guy that he was making camp? Also on display is some of the most garish art direction ever. Austin Powers would vomit. I did dig the shag carpeting in Barb's spaceship, though. What redeems this enterprise is the acting, not least Jane Fonda in the title role. Jane, consummate actress that she is, did understand the tongue-in-cheek aspects of the film. Jane's striptease over the opening credits is something to write home about. Good contributions are also given by David Hemings, Milo O'Shea, Anita Pallenberg, and Ugo Tognazzi. Venture into this flick for it's curiousity value and nothing else."
1,This is a dreadful film now but.....,"I first saw this film as a teenager and thought is was the raunchiest I had ever seen. I had obviously embellished the film in my head since seeing it but on watching it as a much older guy, I find it rather an embarrassment. I am quite sure that Jane Fonda feels much the same way."
3,As bad as you think.,"Barbarella is a mind-numbing torture session, even for lovers of bad films. If the goal was to make the viewer want a steel spike shoved into their head, just to lessen the pain of watching this movie then this is perfection.Killer dolls, a blind angel, overly hairy men, Jane Fonda in all her glory, a talking mime, pathetic effects and a shoestring of a plot equate to this gem of a stinker.Even if you love bad films, be careful. This is REALLY bad."
2,Mixed Emotions,"Well Jane is definately easy on the eyes and the opening scene is nice. However, there is really no story/plot line and no real purpose to the movie at all. The special effects are so bad its almost good. Parts of the movie are worth seeing, overall I wouldn't waste your money."
3,UNCUT OR NOT???,DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THE FILM is the UNCUT EURO CUT with ALL THE NUDITY IN TACT?? Or is it the same butchered USA PG Rated garbage that's been censored since 1968??!
2,A great B-Movie,"Many have seen this movie on TV many times. For a B-movie it is great fun and interesting to watch. No extras on the DVD. I wish they did add something from behind the scenes, etc."
1,Zereba fence charger,"This is a horrid product. We returned it! The information said it would cover 10 acres. However, when we hooked it up it would not even cover the 1 acre we have that needs the fence. We called the company and they said it would not work on horses and only some dogs if they had short hair. When questioned about the 10 acres it was suppose to work on, they just said well it was an estimate.I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT OR THIS COMPANY!!!"
3,Neat...but Lacking an essential ingredient,"I agree that this is a really neat book, and well worth the cost. You should have a basic foundation in knitting before you pick it up, however.What I love about this book is that there are several small sized, unintimidating projects for those new to lace knitting--as well as increasingly difficult projects as your experience grows.But a very serious issue with this book is that there are NO GAUGES. None. Not even some to get you steering on the right path. This is a major obstacle for the beginning lace knitter. But as long as you are okay with that, then this book will be a joy in your knitting library."
3,Quality is very average.,These hot glue sticks are a little softer than some others I've tried in the past. Because of that the bond isn't quite as strong on various projects or repairs. But what can you expect for the price? These are priced reasonably and do a competent job but they are far from the best.3 stars.
2,do not make a costly mistake,If you are buying the amazon stanley glue gun [...] do not buy these. They DO NOT FIT PROPERLY. Bes ure to double check and save yourself some wasted money.
1,Glue Sticks,"This product was OK, but I did not want it. I ordered the glue sticks along with a glue gun. When Amazon informed me the glue gun would not be here for Christmas I canceled my order for the glue gun and tried to cancel the glue stick order. Since the glue sticks were coming from a differenct third party I was not able to cancel the order. I wound up paying more for shipping of the glue sticks than they cost and didn't need them."
1,Simply not funny,"I'm not too picky about dumb comedies, but this movie simply isn't funny. It had a moment or two, but that's about it. Most of it is just plain dumb."
1,Garbage,"Any one who thinks this is a good movie is a sick sick person.Disgusting trash designed to hit new lows in moral behavior.Attempts to shock audience or is it to win them over to theiragenda that promotes drugs, men blowing each other and othersick and disgusting fair at a regular pace. I felt sorry forthe actors in this movie having to prostitute themselves forthe deranged director writer of this .... it does not deserveto be in the same mention as the word ""movie"". Do yourself a'favor do not rent, buy it, or see it. Personally I could notfinish it, its that bad."
1,The entire run of DVDs belongs in the landfill,"Quite possibly the worst movie of the decade. John Cusack must be hard up for money because financial problems is the only reason a name actor would sink to such a low level.I wonder what Cusack & Chevy Chase got paid for this? I hope my $20 at least put a bag of broccoli in their microwaves for their Monday night meal. If it didn't, then I would have done far more good for my Septic tank flushing a bacteria laden twenty down the toilet than to have even a penny of it reward the tenth graders who made this farce.To those who gave this two stars or more, you should spend more time completing your coloring books than wasting your brain cells inflicting this level of damage on yourselves. At least then you might be one of the lucky ones to find employment---possibly painting foreclosed homes for the Bank Of America.Yeah. This review is way over the top. It is quite apropos for this ""movie"". God this movie sucked!"
1,cuss fest galore....as subtle as a warning shot between the eyes,awful....watched 30 minutes of constant f-bombs...note to directors..a LITTLE gos a long way...i was looking forward to this flick and would have returned it if possible....
2,Boring,"Just boring. Could have been funny, but fell flat each and every time. Kind of an amusing story, but it's brought down in stupid jokes and worthless drama..."
3,takes you back...,very funny - good comedy - a good crew of actors makes it well worth watching - highly recomended for all -
4,Loved this dvd,"This DVD was so much more fun watching at home then in the theater. I watched it several times because it is so silly and fun.It is a silly romp through all things 1986. This movie made me feel like Al Bundy reliving his high school football glory years. In the mid 80's I was young, cute, and a total ski bunny. I had my walkman, loved the big hair bands, and thought 30 was old. Now I am way past 30 and can absolutely relate to the realities of the real world that send these guys to try and regain a little fun in their lives.If your looking for a fun show, on par with Dodgeball, another of my favorites, you can't go wrong with this movie."
3,Actually liked it better than The Hangover! Weird..I know!,I did NOT have high expectations for this movie...saw with my husband and our best friends. It was better than expected and I liked it more than I did The Hangover(husband will not agree with me on this one). It had a lot of cuss words and is more for those of us who are not offended by crude humor. We still at times make references to Lougle when joking around. :)
5,HILARIOUS,"A REFRESHINGLY FUNNY MOVIE. ROB CORDDRY, ""THE VIOLATOR"" IS A MAJOR TALENT, AND IS LAUGH OUT LOUD SUPURB. I DO NOT GET THE PRUDISH ONE STAR REVIEWS. IT IS GREAT TO SEE A MOVIE THAT IS A ""HARD"" R. THE MOVIE TAKES PLACE IN THE 80'S. ""EXCESS IS BEST"" WAS THE MONTRA. THE WHOLE MOVIE REVELS IN A DECADE WHERE APPROXIMATELY 90% OF THE MOVIES WERE RATED R. LIGHTEN UP, AND DO NOT LET THE ONE-STAR RATINGS STOP YOU FROM BUYING A TRULY BRILLIANT MOVIE. GO TO CONFESSION AFTERWARDS, IF THAT EASES YOUR MIND. UNLIKE MOST MOST MOVIES OF THIS GENRE, IT IS RELENTLESSLY FUNNY, FROM BEGINNING TO END. JOHN CUSACK IS THE ONLY DOWNER. HE ACTS LIKE HE IS JUST THERE TO COLLECT A PAYCHECK, AND EVEN RIPS ON THE DECADE THAT MADE HIM. CUSACK, CLEARLY ADDED A COUPLE OF HIS CHARACTERS LINES IN ORDER TO ATTACK THE DECADE POLITICALLY. OTHER THAN THAT, WELL WORTH THE MONEY!"
2,Kind of stupid,"After reading the other reviews, I can conclude that I watched the over edited chopped up version of Hot Tub Time Machine. It was an On Demand rental un-rated....so, that is the version I am reviewing. I wanted to love this movie but it fell flat. One basic thing about a period flick is to at least get the custuming right, whomever did the costumes in this film screwed the pooch big time. I am aging myself here but I was a senior in 1986, and I nor anyone I knew dressed even remotely that bizarre. And the hair was all wrong too, especially for the girls. The story was kind of cute none the less, although very hard to follow."
4,"Have seen it before, it was more for my collection",Good price and delivery time was faster than expected. The product arrived just like it was describedhave not used the digital copy yet but it is a good plus
2,Back to The Future for those who like crudeness,"So, they take the whole plot from Back to The Future and add, profanity, crudeness and other gross stuff, including poor acting and no one notices this?Even, Krispin Glover who played the father in Back to The Future is now the bell boy.Skip it, even if free not worth the time you will never get back."
4,"Memories, memories, memories!","I lived through the 80's - I am familiar with the bright colors, the big hair, the music, the ""just find me""... This movie had all of that and it was hilarious!! I couldn't stop laughing in some parts. I don't know if this would be funny to the younger generation that did not live through the 80's, but for those of you who loved the decade, I think you would enjoy it."
3,WACKY HUMOR MEETS THE 80s,"Goofy and wacky humor intermixed with with sex jokes, barfing jokes and even barfing on squirrel jokes. One of the funnier scenes was the BJ scene based on a lost bet but I don't want to spoil it. The first 15-20 minutes are slow and things don't really take off until they head back into time and we are slammed with 80s jokes after 80s jokes. The overall story tends to lag and then rise several times but about a third to half of the jokes makes this worth watching if you like this type of humor. I'm talking to you Saul Morales. Heh. Small cameo by Chevy Chase. Fans of the 80s or those who lived through it will better appreciate this movie. MY GRADE: B minus to B plus (depending on your humor tastes and knowledge of the 80s)."
4,Raunchy Humor,"I bought this movie because I love John Cusack. The movie is very funny, but it is also raunchy and irreverent. I did watch the unrated version first and it was over-the-top, but even though it's not normally the kind of humor I get into it was very funny in a lot of the scenes. I'll watch the theater version to see if it's toned down for a more non-raunchy viewing."
3,it's alright,had some funny parts. i grew up in the 80's so some of the references were funny. It was definetely worth the rental price
4,Just a fun movie!,Just a fun movie about the 80's. I highly recommend it! Twitter + Viagra = Twittagra! A goofy comedy that makes you think at the same time!
5,Good Laughs!,"My husband and I LOVE this movie! Lots of good laughs, but definitely inappropriate for young eyes-don't let your kids see this!"
4,It was goofy,"Hot Tub Time Machine made me laugh, but its no oscar winner. the movie needed lots more boobs, or at least more from the the girl in the bathtub scene"
2,So disappointing,This movie was a big disappointment. I ordered for my husband's birthday and we watched it immediately. WE did not laugh out loud once!! We both love the 80's and thought we would appreciate that aspect of the movie but kept waiting for the movie to be funny. Nowhere near as funny as the Hangover and Superbad. CAn't believe the reviews it got on Amazon. Don't waste your money-rent it!!
5,Hot water,"I really like these slacker, dumb and dumber style comedies, and hot tub time machine did not let me drown. The plot was pretty basic with a little love story mixed in and a cameo with chevy chase. I think it was pretty good all things considered, but for some reason it is better the second time you watch it."
5,"Silly movie, but Great!","OK- so you won't get any smarter from watching this movie, but it was a lot of fun! I laughed out loud several times and even though there was some crude humor and references, I still liked it. I have always like John Cusack and he is one of the producers of this movie. The movie isn't meant to be taken seriously and that is exactly what he intended. Just sit back and enjoy the movie and the 80s music! If you were around in the 80s (and actually had fun!), you will like it."
2,"If you're looking for the usual John Cusack intellectual humor, don't bother.","I love John Cusack. Pretty much every movie he is in I go to see. I knew that this one wasn't going to be his usual awkward, intellectual, rambling comedy and actually thought the premise (while rediculous) could be funny. If you have a problem with heavy profanity (f-bomb every few seconds), then you're gonna be insulted in oh... the first 30 seconds and continue to be so throughout the rest of the picture. I really WANTED to like it....I can take some profanity and vulgarity, but I can't take dumb profantiy and vulgarity. Basically it left me feeling like I do when I've spent an evening in a hot tub party - a little nausiated and a little dirty from the scum I've been stewing in. But hey... maybe that was the point?"
1,terrible movie and not funny at all,"worst movie i have seen in a long, long time. Cusack has sunk to new lows, he must be desperate for money. Stupid, unfunny movie. Don't waste your money."
1,No.,"I know a lot of people say this is a good film if you don't take it too seriously. I'm a fan of the sort of movies you shouldn't take to seriously, but this was just bad."
1,Poor Theme,This movie has no plot of any kind. Just alot of profanity!Not something I would recomend to a couple. It might be attractive to some redneck guys though.
1,didn't laugh once,"I thought this sounded like a good movie. I honestly wanted to like it for its original concept. But I couldn't even finish it, too boring and I didn't get the humor, it just wasn't funny."
2,Hot Tub Time Machine not so hot,Did not really care much for this film. Reviews from others sounded good but I found it too rounchy for me. My kids (20-30's) liked it.
2,Funniest thing about this movie is the title,"OK sorry but you don't get an A for effort with movies. This movie is just flat out not funny. John Cusack is sleep walking through most of it and Rob Cordray keeps proving just how not-funny he is. I mean this guy was fired by the Daily Show because he had so little talent! Craig Robinson is funny and the only person who is worth watch is 80's wack job actor Crispin Glover and the story of how he lost his job.Other than than this is really a stupid movie that is just not funny and is really a waste of time. If you have absolutely no taste and even less intelligence, enjoy it, but for anyone who can read, any book in your house is better than this!"
1,First movie I ever walked out of in my own house!,"This movie is a real stinker. It has no story line. It's not funny. It doesn't even have a decent flashback soundtrack. But heh, it makes up for it by using a four letter word in every other sentence. Ha, hilarious. Only movie I ever walked out of in my house."
1,Terrible; absolute waste of time.,"Don't bother. Unfortunately it's under science fiction genre; thereby just giving it a bad name. Utter waste of time. Boring loser characters and drivel as a storyline. So much better entertainment out there. Rather watch ""Dude, where's my car"" if that's your sort of entertainment or watch proper science fiction."
3,Fairly enjoyable,"For me, this was one of these films that's enjoyable the first time - and that's it. I'm not sure what the creators of this film were thinking when they came up with the idea of a hot tub as a time machine, but this movie failed in some parts. I can appreciate the time travel aspect and trying to fix one's past, but there were way too many stupid and lowbrow jokes in this film to make it truly memorable. If you like any of the starring actors in this film, you might enjoy watching it. But this is a film better for renting, not buying.The ending was decent - one of the better parts of this film, that's for sure. If more thought had gone into this film, it would have been a more memorable one."
4,WOW! I Actually Enjoyed It! Thought It Would Totally Suck,"Just admit it, when you guys first heard the name you were probably already prejudging it as some cheap, B grade, low budget piece of you know whats. But you know what? After years of waiting, I decided why not? So I got it and watched it and I now have it! It is actually pretty funny, combined with a group of decent, interesting characters. Thank god the jokes are decently timed and well paced and well presented. Usually movies like these try to get laughs by outrageous idiotic jokes that disgust or embarrass you into laugher...well this movie does as well but I would say it was good or very decent!I enjoyed it and it's a keeper, would be a fun watch a few months from now on a rainy day. Not bad, don't underestimate this movie, watch it now!I'm not paid to say all this either....i wish...."
4,It's Good to Have Friends,"This tale of friendship between three guys and a younger nephew that accidentally get sent back in time through a hot tube accident. Hilarious as the premise sounds, its a good tale of friendship or bromance.They are stuck in 1986 and have to re-live some bad memories they had previously experienced. They desperately try to find answers as well as avoid changing the future. In the end, what happens, happens but there are enough twists and comedic antics that keeps viewers enjoying it.This is a guy movie with brief nudity and the ladies may not take to it. I found it enjoyable and the moral is whether your life is miserable and heading towards a dead end or its a success where you are filthy rich, you'll always need the bonds of friendship and love from friends and family."
5,Funnier every time!,"This movie is hilarious! Saw it in theaters the first time, loved it, forgot about it. Redboxed it, watched it 3 or 4 more times, loved it more. Every time I watch it, I see or hear something I missed before. As a huge Cusack fan, I expected him to be my favorite, and he is great- but Rob Corddry and Clark Duke steal the show.You will probably appreciate this movie a whole lot more if you lived through the 80s, I especially loved the soundtrack-very nostalgic. Do not let the kids watch this one. The Comedy Central version has to bleep out pretty much everything Corddry says."
5,children of the 80s and Cusack fans will love this,"This movie was smart, funny, entertaining and had heart. If you watch a lot of improv-based comedy (such as The Office), you'll notice that a lot of the dialog is so good, it must have been spontaneous. It's just that full of life and authenticity. Brilliant casting all around.This movie is *not* family friendly, so don't watch it with your kids. But if you grew up/ came of age in the 80s, or you enjoy John Cusack, you'll probably really dig this movie. We rented it and enjoyed it so much we watched it again the next night. And on second viewing, we noticed a lot of little gems hidden in there that we missed the first time, including some of the very smartly cast smaller parts. Again, I'm not into spoiling movies, so I'll just leave it at this: the bit actors they chose were in movies in the 80s.Really fun movie. I hope they make a sequel."
2,Thought it would be better....,"I was really excited to see this movie, looked pretty funny. Well i rented it. Didnt like it at ALL. It really isnt funny, maybe a couple of funny scenes, but most of the movie sucked. The characters are stupid, and its a shame because i really love john cusack's movies :(. Another thing was the curse words, every single line seemed like it had cussing. Seriously you dont need that much profanity in a movie, I understand some, but this was just ridiculous. Bottom line this movie was a disappointment."
3,Funny at times,"This movie had it's funny parts, was not what i expected. I'm a huge John Cusack but this wasn't his best work. I shouldn't have bought it, could've rented it for a dollar and been good to go. The acting is top and joke delivery is there but they could've killed it with more 80's jokes, you see jokes that are not played on. And for being unrated, should've had way more boobie scenes :). Afterall thats what made a good 80's flick."
1,Not funny...not even close...,This movie is not funny. I laughed more at Cats and Dogs 2. (I mean it) Seriously. Whoever said that this is funnier than the hangover must be some sort of...whatever. Chevy Chase why?
1,potential: untapped.,"this film had the potential to be funny... a weird enough plot, a talented enough cast... but it relied on vulgarness and poor dialogue to simply carry it through what could have been funny situations.it wasn't funny, it was sad.if this really happened it would not have made anyone's life better or worse- they just would have continued spinning out of control on this rock...i think it was the direction & the editing that really was below par on this film, through- because even with not-bad performances the timing was just off with the jokes & situations..."
1,Unbelievably stupid,What the heck happened to John Cusack's career? This movie is a moron's delight. Save your money and your time.
1,"Derivative, clumsy, self-conscious, trite - need I go on?","Derivative, clumsy, self-conscious, trite. Rarely funny - or even amusing. The movie attempts to combine Back to the Future with The Hangover and achieves something that's not worth watching. John Cusack's charm helps make it almost bearable. Clark Duke isn't bad, either. Crispin Glover's talents are utterly wasted."
1,Hot Tub Time Machine,"I purchased a new DVD and it froze an hour in. I was disappointed in the quality of a ""new"" video. I mailed it back and I'm still waiting on refund info. I'll buy it at Best Buy or Walmart."
1,Terrible movie,"It's awful, don't waste your time or money. Three previous kids of the 80's wanted to like it, but it was painfully stupid. Moronic writing. NOTHing like The Hangover. I can't believe anyone would give this a positive review."
1,Worst Movie Ive Ever Seen,"I was able to see a sneak peek showing before it came out, for free. I was ripped off. this movie has terrible acting, a worse story, and just the dumbest name in movies.I didn't laugh, just sat there disappointed. Others laughed in the theater, and i just couldn't figure it out. If you want a funny movie, with a dumb name, no real story, get the hangover instead of this POS.Fail It!"
1,Don't bother!,"It wasn't funny. It had it's funny moments...But, after one moment, it was like waiting for lightening to strike twice in the same spot before the other one came along. You'd be better off watching Grown Ups with Adam Sandler."
1,Hot Tub Slime,"Aside from it being ""rude, lewd, and socially unacceptable"" it is not even funny. What at all is ""refreshingly funny"" about four grown men being so nasty to one another and absolutley disgusting? I am sad to see how humor in American movies has truly degenerated, and it's frightening that so many seem to find this type of crap as funny. It's maybe worth 1/2 a star only for the soundtrack. Skip it while you can!"
1,No Wonder Social Etiquette is in the Toilet!,"Screened this movie thinking it would be a fun, nostalgic 80's flavored comedy. Instead, I watched a lame swearing contest between John Cusack and his co-stars. Nothing in this movie seemed fresh or original. In fact, it wasn't even that funny. At least when the comedies of the 80's glorified drugs, sex and drinking they did it with a little less profanity and the scripts were coherent. These days you need to drop the F-Bomb between every other word in order to be ""edgy"" I guess."
1,Boring and a ticking time bomb,"Middle-aged guys go on a reunion and are transported back to the days of their youth courtesy of a hot tub time machine. The jokes are somewhat funny but the movie is mostly lame. Case in point, at a recent MGM board meeting, one of the directors started his speech by apologizing for this movie.One star 10/18/10"
4,Delivers on Promising Title.,"Hot Tub. Time Machine. I'm sure when this was pitched the honchos probably jumped across the desk and had the contracts in hand. Roger Corman in his heyday probably could have taken this and do it on a shoestring budget without any stars and make a ton of money. Nonetheless this flick has John Cusack on hand who would be accused of slumming if he wasn't one of the producers. The $64,000.00question is does the film work. For the most part, yeah. ""Hot Tub Machine"" is unashamedly raunchy version of ""Back to the Future"" with a twist of ""Porky's"" thrown in. This is terrific flick for the bros to sit around to and drink beer. I might add, though, that my sister liked it and my wife gave it a marginal pass."
4,Fun movie,A great r-rated comedy with a few suprizes along the way...great cameo by Chevy Chase and loaded with laughs from start to end
3,I wanted it to be better...,"Steve Pink's film is really a rip-off of Back to the Future. I was only occasionally amused, but I wanted more, especially from John Cusack, whom I've admired over the years; his manic breakout role in The Sure Thing, a sweet role in Say Anything, and a great performance in Grace is Gone...I was thinking he could do no wrong. Well, I guess I just don't know what he was thinking here... Rob Corddry was amusing, as was geeky Clark Dane as the only smart one in the group. This is not Mr Pink's best film, nor would I buy it for future viewings. Back to the Future is too brilliant a film to attempt to copy. What were they thinking?"
2,djeff,"Disappointing. With this cast and the interesting concept of traveling back in time into the 70's fashions, decor and lingo for a second chance in life it came out a real dud. It had to be real hard to mess up this one but they did. there are some good scenes and motif is an interesting flashback. Beyond that the story just didn't get off the ground."
4,hot tub time machine,"this is a teen movie with some good thoughts and story but they could of done so much more its got 2010 sense of comedy but there could of been so much more , its a shame that these movies are made by a few who think they dont have to be that good or there political done in the kinda dumb way . there so much better talent in usa who could of taken this movie to entertain a better way , but they dont care there not much competion in hollywood they dont have to make great movies just enough to double there investment."
2,Terrible,Hot Tub Time Machine had the potential to be funny but it fell really short. Some parts were ok but overall it was basic bathroom humor and enough F-bombs to make you wonder if there was really any dialogue actually written. John Cusack has really fallen as an actor and to top it off he actually was involved in producing Hot Tub Time Machine. What was he thinking?
2,Disappointed,Definitely a guys movie. They could have done better with Chevy Chase and John Cusack in the movie. More time just being silly rather than reflecting the dramatic differences between growing up in the 1980's and now.
2,OK,I HOPE PART 2 IS BETTER THEN THIS CRAP. TO MANY BAD WORDS COULD HAVE BEEN 3 STARS BUT NOT. I GIVE IT TO STARS. CAN:T WAIT FOE PART 2 LOL
3,"Low budget, but oddly I liked it","This is utterly stupid and mindless, yet there was something about it that I liked enough to watch to completion. The plot is absurd, but the actors are somehow touching here. It's a little old-fashioned, almost like an 80s movie, maybe because the film spends most of its time stuck in the 80s as four time travelers go back to 1986 as if that were another century. Well, it was another century, but still...."
2,"no ""zak and miri""",was hoping it'd be one of those movies taht looked really dumb but ended up being good...i was wrong. it was pretty dumb. there were one or two funny jokes but that was about it and the end was stupid. it had a good comedy cast and an interesting premise but not enough happened in the movie.
3,"Nice title, full of promise","Adam (John Cusack) and his buddies Nick (Craig Robinson) and Lou (Rob Corddry) and his nephew Jacob (Clark Duke), have run a ""down and out"" sort of life. They get naked together and are washed back to the year 1987 where they have an opportunity to reflect and correct old attitudes. Will they take advantage of this opportunity or just relive their poor choices that let them their present life.The formula is as old as the hills. Nevertheless, it is always nice to see the old actors and watch their rendition of confrontation with life changing opportunities. What would you do if you could do it over?My only disappointment was expecting something a tad more feminine in the tub.If you like this formula a more sedate version is:The Family ManIf you were expecting a hot tub, a better mix is:Eating Raoul"
2,Not funny at all. Very disappointed!,"It just couldnt make me laugh at all. Quite boring indeed. The ""nostalgic"" stuff is weak, so is the performance of John Cusack. In short, not recommended."
2,Definitely NOT a clean movie!,"I really gave it 2 stars because of the awesome 80's music in it. Love Poison!This was supposed to be a funny movie? Come on. It had so much filthy language in it I couldn't get past the so-called jokes in it. Just not what I imagined it would be. It didn't have to be that filthy to be a funny movie. I mean, the title says it all! Come on writers!!! Can't anyone out there make a funny movie without all of the smut and language to drag it down to Porky's level??? I had to fast forward through scenes that should have been rated NC17!!! Just very, very disappointed/sad that our society gives 2 thumbs up to this kind of movie."
5,Sesame Street - What's the Name of That Song,"My two year old loves this movie. We have a couple Sesame Street DVD and this is the best. And since I have to watch it also, it helps that I love it too!"
5,Fun songs!,"My girls, 3.5 and 20 months, love this DVD. We watched in in the car during a road trip and we were all singing along."
2,Unskippable ads,"This begins with a long ad. They made the ad unskippable, un fastforwardable, and turned off skip to menu.That means every time you put this in for your child, sitting through a an ad waiting for the menu.We like the DVD, but we don't watch it because of the hassle."
5,Sesame Street - What's the Name of That Song,"My 11 month old son just loves this DVD. He watches at least 2 times a day. He can't get enough of it! I think the program is adorable. The way they put in the cameos from the actual show is very cute. If your kid loves Sesame Street, they will love this DVD!"
4,Wondeful if your child loves songs,My son is 3 years old. He's been watching Sesame Street since he was 5 months old. He loves the songs. You will know most or all of the stars they show. Wayne Brady is funny between the bread.
2,Disappointed,My 20 month old is a HUGE Sesame Street fan but I was disappointed in this one. He was uninterested. I would recommend The Best of Elmo and Lets Make Music.
4,Jasminium is spellbinding!!,"Jonathan Luckett's Jasminium is both beautiful and hypnotic. Taj and Cheyenne, share a pact and a love that transcends time and circumstance. This is by far no ordinary love story, Jonathan truly raises the bar for originality."
5,Breathtaking...,"What I love most about this book was it depth and power. This love story, this journey of unspeakable love between Taj and Cheyenne, is breathtaking. Luckett's writing style is alluring and engaging, and its unpredictability...I had no choice but to finish the book in one setting, rearranging the evening plans, having family and friends wondering what I'm reading that has monopolized my time. I just had to find out the secret that tied them with such intensity, yet unbeknownst to those that loved them most...and how their story and lives would end or should I say begin."
4,is the past ever really the past?,"Two teenagers, Taj and Cheyenne, met when they shared a horrific experience. In order to move on with their lives,they made a pact to never tell anyone else. Twenty years later they meet in a chance encounter bringing to the surface memories and feelings they thought they had buried. Unbeknownst to each other, they both return to the scene of their horrific experience. What will happen when they come face-to-face with their demons? Will they find peace and truly be able to move on?Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down tyring to find out what went down between them twenty years prior. Enjoyed it."
1,Dust Under Protector,"Outstanding idea, but I could not keep dust from getting under the protector. When I tried to wash the dust off, it was unsuccessful."
5,Skate Punk 80's Cheese at it's finest!!!!!!!!!,"Ok, I read a few reviews on here and some people were dissin' this movie. But the fact of the matter is that this MOVIE IS RAD!!!! If you are an oldschool skate punk you know what I'm talking about. This movie captured a peice of skate history. The evil Daggers vs. The clean cut Ramp Locals! C'mon it dosen't get any better then that! They even have a crazy ditch skating joust scene that makes me laugh everytime I see it. Christian Hosoi, Eddie Reatuggi, Tony Alva... the list goes on and on. The director's commentary is the best thing I've ever heard!"
5,Citizen Who? ..Thrashin..greatest movie ever.,"OKay. this is a totally biased review, Thrashin has been my favorite movie since i was a young lad, this movie encompasses all that is/was skateboarding in the 1980's. Sure, the acting is cheesy at times, but that gives the film charm, there is punk rock band named after the villians in this movie called ""Hook and the Daggers"" that eveyone should check out. skateboarding, punk rock, red hot chili peppers, a really terrible love scene, this movie has it ALL!! buy the movie already. DVD bonus stuff is cool too with interview w/ Robert Russler (Hook)"
4,romantic,"My boyfriend would always talk bout this movie, so when I found it here on Amazon I had to get it for him. He always takes this movie on road trips or if we just wanna have a movie night. It's fun to watch. The movie lines are the best in this film and it cracks us up every time."
5,Mi película de cuanto tenía 15 años...,"Tenía muy buenos recuerdos de esta película, y llevaba años buscándola.Eso sí, la zona de video no es compatible con la mayoría de los reproductores de DVD domésticos, por lo que hay que verla en el ordenador, o hacerte una copia del DVD, eliminando la protección por zonas."
5,Bab's stepson,Corey webster leaves home with 35 bucks and skates his way to LA or venice beach to race in the LA downhill. along the way he falls for dorky Kristi whose brother is the leader of the evil DAGGERS. They have rank OJ in the frig and will stop at nothing to detroy the dream of Corey Webster turning pro.
3,not able to get the key pad working yet,"The manual and ""readme"" files are poorly and hastily written. Voice quality is good.Don't know which drivers to install to get the key pad up and running. No manufacturer's name /data on the phone. You can't even find AU-100 written anywhere on the phone.Seems the manufacturer wants to be anonymous and isn't interested in publicity."
1,Junk - Not as pictured - Cheap silver model,"Bought from echo - not as pictured. Cheap silver junk. Buttons dont make any sound when pressed, the face does not light up. Very poor - dont waste your money on this.... spend a few dollars more and you can get much better product."
4,Good USB phone,"The product is great, but the interface to Vonage softphone is a bit stressful because the software does not load everytime. Once it is loaded you will be glad and wont be to frustrated that it took you all that time to get it to work. It is worth the price because it is much better than using a set of headphones with a mic."
4,"To buy with OSPF Network Design Solutions, Second Edition","Buy this if You have OSPF Network Design Solutions, Second Editionby Tom Thomas. A useful command reference on Osfp and good example."
3,Many errors - too bad,"They had the right idea they decided to publish this book. A good command and configuration guide for OSPF is much needed. This is not that book, sadly. Technical errors abound. I worked through the configurations with a lab full of 2612 routers using IOS 12.1 (you need at least 4 routers with 2 serial ports and an ethernet port to complete all of the configurations). All I can say is I wish Cisco Press had done the same thing BEFORE publishing this book! I'm being generous giving this book 3 stars."
2,Not as fun as expected,"This toy isn't worth the money you pay for it. It isn't much fun at all, in fact its only ""fun"" part is the cute laughing sound it makes when you push the nose. My 2 year old daughter, hardly played with it at all before it got left in the box with all the other boring toys. I wouldn't purchase again."
3,"Cute, but beware, there's no ""off"" switch.",My daughter likes this toy and I have to admit it's pretty cute. I just can't stand toys that can't be shut off. Every now and then I'll close the lid to the toy box and hear Tigger singing his song so I have to dig through and pull it out. It's also apparently very sensitive because a few times it's started playing the song for no apparent reason.
2,"Oh, the Humanity!","I am a diehard cure fan from way back. I would have to say my favorite cure album is a toss up between Head on the Door, or Seventeen Seconds. Perhaps that is my problem. I like the dark and moody cure. I like Goth music, and the Cure is what I call ""Goth Light."" I found ""Wild Mood Swings"" disturbingly bright, and not too good musically. I get through about the fourth song, and have to remove the offensive object from my cd player lest I burst into flames. If you really like the cure's other albums, and darker music in general, (I am listening to Fields of the Nephilim as I write this review), steer away from this album."
1,Definitely not a classic if you ask me...,"Wild Mood Swings is so crap, I just can't believe it's from The Cure, a band that I really like. I guess I'm not the only one who is disappointed; the second-hand records shops in my town are full of unsold copies. Anyway, the only song I like is Jupiter Crash. I don't know what Smith was trying to do, but he failed miserably. Well, I forgive him. The Cure gave us such brilliant albums (Pornography and Disintegration). It's time to retire guys..."
1,"This is one ""Swing"" you want to avoid","what was the Cure thinking? Either Robert Smith was hungover every single day this album was put together, or he just wanted to try and make the most horrible Cure record in history. This album is pitiful from start to finish. It's enough to make ""Charlotte (sometimes)"" roll in her grave. Don't waste your money on this puppy. You want a good Cure album? Go get ""Pornography"" or ""Seveteen Seconds"" or ""Bloodflowers"". I gotta go....the CD exchange is gonna give me 5 bucks for ""Wild Mood Swings"". I just hope they don't read this review before I get there."
5,"""jupiter crash"" IS 1 THE REASONS TO BUY THIS!","""JUPITER CRASH"" IS ONE OF THE REASONS TO BUY THIS CD BECAUSE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL SONG FROM IT'S LYRICS TO IT'S MUSIC TO ROBERTS INCREADIBLE VOCAL I HAVEN'T BEEN A CURE FAN VERY LONG BUT THIS IS A GREAT CD SOME OTHER GREAT SONGS ARE ""GONE"" ""MINTCAR"" AND ""WANT"" I AIN'T A CRITIC BUT I AM A AVID MUSIC LISTENER AND THIS IS WONDERFUL!"
3,Odd but still the Cure,"""Want,"" ""Club America,"" ""Gone,"" and ""Numb"" are reminiscent of classic Cure, while ""Mint Car"" sounds a lot like an updated ""Friday I'm in Love."" ""This is a Lie"" is the best track on the album, but overall, this is another standard Cure album. Gothic, yet with strange and upbeat melodies. Odder than most Cure albums, but still decent. Not exactly one of their best however."
2,Their weakest album!,"To this day, Wild Mood Swings is my least favorite and least played Cure album. They attempt to do dance music on this one, yet never really pull it off in most cases. Most of the album never grabbed me. Only The 13th was the best song. The '96 songs that were selected for '97's Galore are the ones I skip the most on that CD. Robert Smith's writing and the band's music seemed to have lost ground. I don't think they recovered after this one."
2,A mistake,"One or two good songs, especially the first one. The rest is unbearable. Before Bloodflowers came out, I really thought it was the end of The Cure.Buy the singles (The 13th and Mint Car) instead. Not for the hit songs themselves but because they have really good B-sides..."
2,HMMMM......just not great.,"Robert Smith seems so brilliant just from watching the changes he has gone through in life. But really he is just a normal human too (for the most part, granted). He can be silly and happy.....good, he shows it. However, in Wild Mood Swings it seems to be much less poetic and inspiring than earlier albums like Seventeen Seconds, Faith, Pornography or Disintegration.I personally am not ever going to buy this album. I have heard it all the way through and it doesn't do much for me...I love ""This is a Lie""....it is almost too true for lots of people. ""Jupiter Crash"" is alone and dreamy. Besides that the rest i would not pay for. It is like saltine crackers. It is something but not that memorable or filling."
3,Robert Smith and Compan in typical eclectic fashion!,"This is a very interesting album. I read/heard alot of negative feedback concerning this album. But, true Cure fans can respect it for what it is. And like it or not, no one can say anything bad about Robert's awesome ability as a songwriter. He's a musical genius!As far as liking it or disliking it goes, I say ""yes"" and ""no"". I go back and forth. Sometimes I'll listen to it and think: WOW! Robert you've really out done yourself this time! Then, I'll listen to it another time and think: Robert, even though you blew it, you're still alright in my book!Of all the Cure albums (and I own them all!), this is my least favorite. But still, it yielded some good things. Notibly ""This Is A Lie"", ""Jupiter Crash"", and ""Want"".A must have for all ""TRUE"" Cure fans."
3,a vision of the cure that's been softened by time,"This album has a few really great singles (and a few which would've been great had they actually released them.) If you've heard a few tracks on the radio it's a great album to get. Sadly, some of the songs lack the conviction of The Cure's previous albums. It harkens back slightly to Wish, but carries a little of the mid-90's-MTV-plastic-pants-with-glitter-eye-make-up-on-a-vinyl-inflatable-chair kind of pop culture. It's good. It definetly wobbles."
1,most disappointing,"I love the Cure. I have all of their albums, and when this album came out I rushed out and bought it. Talk about a let down! How could they put out such garbage after all their great albums? I just hope the new album, Bloodflowers, will redeem them."
2,I tried...but I gave up,"I have to agree with all of the negative reviews of this album. It just lacks the 'edge' that other albums from The Cure seem to have.Music-wise, it's a good album. The band is definitely in form on this release. But the songwriting is bland and at times uninspired.This was actually the third Cure album I bought, and I remember when I first listened to it, I didn't HATE it, but it simply didn't have the passion that such albums as Disintegration have.To me, Wild Mood Swings is, to Robert Smith, what 'Zwan' was to Billy Corgan. A collection of well-structured, but uninspired songs that are neither 'great' nor 'terrible'.2.5 stars."
3,"""Happy Cure"".","Besides the fact that the cover art's bad, here's the deal with ""Wild Mood Swings"". When taken by itself, it's actually quite good. Very up, and pop melodies. There's pop songs on many Cure albums, just not so many. The bashing starts when this is compared to other Cure classics. Imagine if INXS had put out a slow, dark, acoustic cd. It would've been the same kind of shock. I'm actually glad we didn't get a ""Disintegration"" part 2, 3, and 4. And this does have a few of the typical Cure songs on it as well. But overall, if you're a ""Greatest Hits"" kind of Cure fan, you should enjoy this also. It was good that this was followed by ""Bloodflowers"" though."
2,This album made me sad,"Being a life long Cure fan I always feared the album that just wouldnt cut it..well this is that album...these songs are mediocore at best..I cant listen to it...the next album is suposed to be darker, I look forward to it"
2,a very sad little album.,"i was so excited about a new cure release! the radio songs weren't bad... i don't expect much from cure radio songs. mint car was cute and the 13th kinda grew on me. strange attraction was awful, but every album has at least one awful song. i listened to the whole cd a few times and nothing else caught my attention. it's pretty sad when the radio songs on a cure cd are the best songs."
1,NO JAPANESE WHISPERS HERE,"Many reviewers have referred to this album's quirky feel and variety of styles, I think you would be wise to click the back button on your browser, buy ""Japanese Whispers"", ""The Top"", ""Boys Don't Cry"", ""Kiss Me..."" and find yourselves far more satisfied. If you can afford it try getting ""Three Imaginary Boys"" and ""The Cure anomalies."" I also recommend the cassette version of ""Standing on the Beach"" for side 2. Almost any Cure b-side will do more to fulfill your appetite for quirkiness and variety than this album. If it weren't for the somber ""Jupiter Crash"" and ""Treasure"" this one would have been traded back. ""Wild Mood Swings"" has zero sparkle and very little atmosphere. If you're still not satisfied with the above recommendations at least purchase The Glove's ""Blue Sunshine."""
1,I tried,"I was a huge Cure fan in the 90s. When this came out I really really wanted it to be great. I listened to it many times. I remember none of the songs and didn't like ONE song on the CD. If you want an underrated Cure CD, go get Wish. Don't even bother with this one. Completely forgetable."
4,Overlooked and unfairly panned,"How could you possible pan this album? It has many excellent tracks, Want, Jupiter Crash, Gone!, This Is A Lie, Strange Attraction, and many others, hell, I have always liked The 13th. I am always up for bans mixing it up, and they certainly did. I highly reccomend this album, don't listen to the naysayers.Also loved Bloodflowers and the newly released The Cure."
3,more like 2 and 1/2 stars,"Wild mood swings was the long awaited album for lots of cure fans, and i think it disappointed most, (well at least me!) I think the best songs on this album are the more upbeat ones(ie mint car, club america etc) Most of the other songs are fairly boring and are nothing new to the cure. I think other people will love this album, and if you are new to the cure this would probably be a fun album to listen to. The cure, however, are capable of much better. Oh well."
2,Wild Mood Swings was a major disappointment,"I jetted to the music store to buy this album the day it came out and was truly disappointed. It has nothing to do with it not having a dark side, it's just lacking something... Maybe it doesn't have that certain poetic consistency as previous cure albums. There are a couple good songs, but nothing you can actually sit through without breaking to get some headache medicine."
3,"HALF IS GOOD, YES GOOD INDEED",This cd starts off with them sing songs of themes that are normally not in cure songs. And after listening to it for three months they kind of grow on you. But as the cd goes on the themes and music go back to classic cure songs.Lyrically Smith is a genius and the supporting cast is great.
4,An honest tribute to the more fickle feelings of man,"A lot of people really didn't like this albulm as compared to the of The Cure's material. True, it isn't a dark albulm, but like all the rest of the Cure's albulm it is honest and surrounded by wonderfully layered music. Simon Gallup is the best bassist in the world, and if you take the time to listen to the more subtle isuues being addressed, such as indecion and addiction, you might find a change a pace from the love/hate that is almost always present in The Cure's work. It's is still not the groups best albulm, but there can only be one Disintegration."
3,Did you know?,"if u get the single for the 13th, it has this extra track plus another one, called ocean. it just seems dumb to pay 33.99 for 1 cd. even one from the cure, i would, but i'm using common sense. Go buy the single! get away from here!"
5,Great CD,"This is just a great cd, with all kind if music style in it, like only ""The Cure"" know how to make."
5,"Happy, but not as happy as you might think....","Yes, this album is brighter perhaps than some of our favorites like Disintegration or Pornography. But what is really wrong with that? If after two decades of lament, loss and searching, Robert Smith is finally finding some answers shouldn't we, as his fans, be happy for him? Not that I really believe that this is it anyway, because songs like ""This Is A Lie"" and ""Bare,"" the haunting last track, leave plenty of questions in the air. Experienced Cure listeners will, after a few listens, realize that it isn't really that perky after all, the subtle (perhaps too subtle for some) major themes emerging as the tragedies of lust and addiction. The music is the trademark layered, complex, always slightly dreamy, rock that Robert and the boys are known for, and there is plenty here lyrically for those willing to open their eyes a bit. Fabulous."
4,Excellent Cologne,"Sweet, elegant, and a tad musky. This cologne has garnished a few compliments and I think it's great."
1,nauseating,"can not imagine how some people like this smell. It made every body in the house nauseous.You got to smell this before you think about ordering such a cheap thing. Base line Cheap, can not be used."
2,Hmmm. A let-down.,"Not as good even as 2007. Hard to figure out how to just have a career (i.e. play for Liverpool consecutive years). Can't figure out how to upgrade players (It adds XP experience points but doesn't let me spend them). Too many horns in the crowd, and everyone knows that horns at sporting events are obnoxious. Defense is worse then previous years since an attacker can virtually waltz through your defense since the tackling is so horrid and the automatic switching makes you take a player you may not have wanted and even if you take the right player he almost always starts out running the wrong direction you want him to. I wish that smart, quality players of real football/soccer would test these games out and sort out a lot of the goofy little problems there are. Also, incredibly difficult to figure out how to shoot! I.e. I still have no clue how to diliberately aim low. Anyone have some help???"
3,not really better than fifa 07,"Do not buy this game. It's basically the same game as FIFA 07 with a few very minor changes. Most of the things that I hated about FIFA 07 are still there, except that, to make sure that the game is even less fun, it is now harder to score from outside the penalty area. Otherwise, it's really the same game, they're obviously reusing the same engine. As you play it you realize that it feels exactly the same way. The few minor new features are not worth buying a new version of the game, in fact, some of them are practically useless. Overall, a huge disappointment. I was so looking forward to that game. I guess I'm going to wait for the new version of Winning Eleven and give that a try when it comes out."
5,Awesome,"Love FIFA 08. It gets better every year, this is one of the best versions I have seen so far. Can't wait for 09"
3,The Academy of Love by Clare Frances Holmes (Nightingale Large Print Romance),"Description from the book back cover:The year is 1815. Ill-used at her finishing school, her inheritance gone and her parents missing in France, Prudence Marriott is aided by the widowed Lady Challis. With an ardent nature, Prudence longs to meet the big occasions of life head on. Her wish is granted when she becomes involved in espionage. Desperate risks are taken, including an horrific voyage to France, where she serves in a field hospital and witnesses the Battle of Waterloo. At last she is reunited with the man she loves, through whom the perplexities of her life are resolved."
3,This book is OK,"This book is ok for the first time flea market vendor, though it contains very little information on the most difficult part of flea market selling----FINDING SOMETHING AT A GOOD PRICE TO SELL!!! Not a bad book but try to buy it used for only a couple of bucks. It contains info on what to sell, how to set up, and selling techniques,etc,etc...But once again, it contains almost no information on sources of things TO SELL."
2,This book has one premise: bash Ford,"Car starts out promisingly enough, with all the drama needed to tell a good story: the redesign of Ford's best-selling car, the Taurus.Unfortunately, it soon becomes clear that Ms. Walton is more interested in bashing Ford than telling the story about the Taurus. Normal work conflicts that happen at every company are blown out of proportion and presented as enormous crises.The proof that Ms. Walton did not set out to tell the story of the Taurus is the way she half-heartedly discusses important design issues and then suddenly drops them to follow personality conflicts at Ford. Where is the discussion of the forward-looking integrated control panel? She tells a long story about how the headlight design causes grave conflicts among employees, and yet never even bothers to tell how the conflict was resolved. This book was a real disappointement for me"
2,Heavy on the cliches,"I just finished this book. While it paints an interesting picture about the process to bring a car to market, the style Walton employs falls short. I understand the strategy to be the naive narrator (learning with reader how things work), but she uses too many cliches and poor analogies to make her point. I don't know how many times she said ""Ugly as sin"" or even ""It was, like,"" a few times. I'd recommend David Halberstam's The Reckoning or Comeback as well-written alternatives about the same subject, especially Comeback's depiction of the Mustang overhaul, than this book."
1,Mary Walton. Her View. America Does not work,"Ms. Walton has written a masterfull distortion of the American Corporation. This work of fiction is a focus on negative distortions of a company that , through Henry Ford, brought America into the 20'th Century and the Automotive Age.One Example. In her book, Ms. Walton focuses on how devastated the design team was that the Outside Mirror was mounted above the sheet metal in the corner of the door. Take a look at your own car. 99% of all cars and trucks are made this way. Ms. Walton. Give America a Chance. Thanks....The Taurus is still one of the best selling cars. I'd like to see one of the Foreign Companies Allow Liberal Writers like Ms. Walton the courtesy and Access that was given to her by Ford. I wonder if a book on her Foreign Friends would be as liberally Slanted to the negative as her work of Fiction on Ford.This book is not worth your trouble to read."
4,Good for anyone even remotely interested in car development.,"I am a graduating mechanical engineer, and I've read this book every year I've been at school. Every time I read it I get more excited about entering this volatile world of automotobile development, as a cast member of the ""drama of the American workplace.""Other reviews for this book penalize Mary Walton for selecting the Taurus, but what most people forget to realize is that the family sedan is probably the most difficult car to engineer. You have to satisfy a much wider range of people than if you were building, say a C5 corvette where all you have to do is make it go fast and burn corners. I found the Taurus examination much more fulfilling."
1,The book did not capture the drama of working on Team Taurus,"I worked on Team Taurus during the launch of this car. This book is subtitled ""A Drama of the American Workplace"" but it completely failed to capture the true ""drama"" of what it was like to work on this project. Right off the bat, it's very negative about everything and everyone associated with the project. It certainly failed to capture the strong sense of purpose which we all felt working to try to build this car. Also, while everything is the book is true and accurate, it's written in such a boring tone that it's a chore to read. Insignificant details are added (such as what a person ordered to drink ?), while other major parts of the story are left out. (Like the fact that there was another launch team working their butts off in Chicago !) Overall the book does travel through the story of how the 1996 Ford Taurus came to be. However, you won't enjoy the ride...."
4,"Car, by Mary Walton","Very interesting study of the effort to bring a new car design to the showroom. Well written and easy to understand, even while introducing all sorts of automobile jargon. I skimmed through all the ""human interest"" parts, which described the lives of the main characters. Others might find that interesting, but I was just interested in the interaction of the multitude of groups involved in such a project, most often in competition with each other, and, more often than not, working at cross-purposes."
2,"Decent, but there are better options","I was expecting a more in-depth book. Had I not previously read ""All Corvettes Are Red"" I would probably think more highly of this book. I think this skimmed over the design process, particularly the body styling. And did not do a very good job with the actual conflict resolution. I suppose I am a glutton for details, but I just think this could have been more detailed.I would reccomend ""All Corvettes Are Red"" over this as a superior narration of vehicle development."
5,Pure...,"Pop perfection. As simple as that! Forget all the comparisons, or accusations about ripping-off the 60s. This is PURE POP PERFECTION."
4,Good complete workout,"I originally wanted to watch this video first before even trying it, because i didn't want to waste my time if the video didn't look challenging. I mainly wanted the excercise ball. I watched for about 10 min and it seemed quite simple, so I decided to try it anyway. Well after about 5 min into the ""warm up"" i was sweating bullets and my heart rate was up! I was pleasantly surprised that i was actually getting a good full body workout. The only problem i had was that i wanted to concentrate a little more on the abs, and the excercises they did do for the abs it didn't seem long enough to get a burn. But overall, good dvd!"
3,Okay,"The video seems pretty challenging, even though my abs aren't really what gets tired (even though she says it works your abs a lot). I have a hard time doing this video because of all the space it requires! I cleared out my den, but still had to move to the edge of the room, like up against the wall, to be able to ""roll out"" for the ball to be under my shins (I'm also a tall person so that may have something to do with it).I wouldn't really recommend the video unless you want to get basic ideas for how to use the ball. What I like to do is take certain moves (like pushups, crunches, dumbbell chest flys, etc) that I've done on other videos and do them on the ball. It makes it more challenging.Stability balls are great, but I'm going to stick with my other videos where I can focus on exercising instead of banging into couches or walls."
2,For Beginners Only,"I'm an intermediate/advanced exerciser. If you are similar to me then you will be disappointed by this video. I think it's great for the beginner. There are some good exercisers and perhaps if she did more reps, I would have felt some more burn, but in all honesty, I felt very little after this workout."
3,eh,This is definitely for beginners. It just didn't seem to do much for a 30 minute workout. I was not sore the next day.
3,what I expected,"Product arrived, just as I expected it. Timely and transaction was smooth. Good purchasing experience."
5,It doesn't get better than this,"This set matches the complete recordings of one of the best pre-war jubilee quartets, the Southern Songs, with the first recordings of the Harmonizing Four. The first national exposure came for the Harmonizing Four when they sang at President Roosevelt's funeral - after that they toured extensively, making a tour of Europe in 1966. The Southern Sons were a great group in the jubilee tradition - their version of the Negro National Anthem, ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" is worth the price of the CD. For more resources related to African American music and history, visit my website at CreativeFolk.com"
2,Not worth it,"I've been in EMS for over 20 years and when I took the CCEMT-P class I bought this book to read ""ahead"" before the class. The book read like any Paramedic textbook and did VERY little to prepare me for the UMBC CCEMT course, it had little to no correlation to the material taught in the course (the book is not recommended by UMBC nor does the book claim to be a part of that course, but the name indicated to me that it would be relevant). It doesn't go into enough detail of the ""advanced"" parts of the CC scope and spends a lot of time reviewing things that if you haven't already mastered you probably shouldn't be preparing for certification at this level."
2,An elementry crtical care book,This is a good book to peek into the world of critical care. It's also a good book to give you insight into your patient conditions based on medications etc. Not worth mucj for reviewing for FP-C or CCEMT-P.
3,Its a textbook.,"It is very ""classic"" text book style. You will learn extensive ins and out of the critical care paramedic, however if you have ever taken a college course where the instructor reads off the power point to you. Its about like that. A more interesting text I read in conjunction with this one was ASTNA Patient Transport: Principles and Practice."
2,I've had better,"We used this text to take us through the Cleveland Clinic CICP course. Granted, if books and coursework are created by different groups they may not match up conveniently, but I found myself constantly referencing my other texts to supplement what I was reading in this book. Many grammatical errors were found as well. I was frustrated in reading the text as I continued to find reapeating sentences and paragraphs, while it lacked important detail in other areas. There are lots of clear tables and figures, but they often lack great explanation. Overall, I would suggest another route."
1,False Advertising,"Unlike the other reviewer, I purchased and have tried to read this tome. The best part of it is the cover, which features a photo of great Chicago tenor Fred Anderson. Unfortunately, the book does not live up to its title, ""On Late Chicago Jazz."" The book is ""on"" the author and his stream of consciousness musings and memories tipped off by a reference (often circuitous) to a Chicago jazz musician, or a musician that played there frequently. The book is a huge disappointment, because with all that needs to be said about the purported topic, little is. The book has its moments, but for the most part is a precious, narcissistic rambling of tangents and digressions; worse than Ramblin' Jack Elliott or Henry Miller at their most tedious. In pukka, it's a flat out drag, daddio. If you want some knowledge on late Chicago jazz, for now you're much better off buying a Delmark CD (or 2) and reading the liner notes."
1,all legs fell off,"I rec'd mine a few years ago as a gift. Same thing happened with mine as did with the first reviewer. Tried glueing them back but that didn't work very well -- even with very strong glue. I love the crab and have been wanting a replacement, but not sure now I should even bother."
3,"beautiful and unique, but small","The length of the earspirals are a little shorter than expected but they are really pretty! when I got them and held them in my hands, THEN I appreciated just how special and unique they really are, but buyer beware that they can seem a little bit smaller than I anticipated; they are almost like a piece of wire that has been crafted and twisted into a unique shape. I suggest browsing their website [...] to get a more accurate idea of the length and their other unique earspiral varieties."
1,Office Pro 2007 software,"The packaging appeared to be factory created. The product turned out to be useless. When trying to validate the installation with Microsoft, we were informed that the software key code is from a group of pirated numbers and Microsoft would not validate. Product was returned."
4,Polycom Sound Station Premier,"I works beautifully. We had five board members in a conference room in Vermont and four board members scattered around the nation, 2 in Florida, another in a different location in Vermont and another in New Hampshire. All had equal participation during our nearly 2 hour boards meeting."
1,Avoid like the plague (or the pox),"This book has very little to recommend it. Too densely written for popular history, and too poorly researched and edited for academia, it comes across as little more than a rather juvenile attempt to collect T & A stories from medieval European sources. There's no central thesis, no cogent argument, no proper attribution of source material, and no index! a pet hate of mine - in short, very little to recommend the work as a whole, unless you get your jollies reading laboriously stuffy allusions to the sexual practices of centuries-dead Europeans."
3,Annoying voice acting,"I wanted to be able to watch this show until the finish. I was able to make it through the whole first season, but I just could not stand the annoyance of the voices."
2,Definitely NOT for kids,I was looking for some anime for my daughter to watch and this was definitely not kid friendly. Lots of gratuitous nudity and pervy jokes. It might have been fun to watch when I was a teenage boy but it is pretty lame as a grownup.
3,"Interesting and Scholarly, But dated","Bornkamm's book was originally published in 1956. As such it has to be considered within its historical context, and Bornkamm suffers from not being able to take advantage of the enormous work in biblical scholarship since that time as well as the release of the Qumran documents. That being said, this is a well written and thought provoking book. It covers much of the same ground as other ""Life of Jesus"" books, although Bornkamm is neither sysmetic nor comprehensive in his coverage. The most appealing sections of the book are his analyses of the Kingdom of Heaven, the parables, and his approach to the crucifixion and messianic questions. Bornkamm tends to raise issues and avoids offering conclusions. Some readers will find that attractive.An introductory student of the life of the historical Jesus may find this book valuable. More advanced students should probably look elsewhere."
5,Conclusion to an AMAZING storyline.,"OK, I will be blunt - you need to read Vol. 1 first then read this volume slowly. There are several story details in the first 100 pages or so (4-5 issues) that are essential to understanding what happens near the end. The first time I read this storyline when it was new, I was confused as hell at who was doing what, but reading it now as one volume it does make sense but I saw several parts where I had missed quick asides and minor plot points that come back big later.The story is just WOW. And the buildup and conclusion is pure awesomeness. Never mind that the art is some of the best on the market, period."
4,If you want just one X-Men comic,"I'm old enough to remember when there was just one X-Men comic, which made following that universe fairly simple. Today, I don't have the patience (or the funds) to follow all of the various titles, but I can enjoy one series without all of the others, and this is it. I also have no interest in heading to the comic book store once a week, so this collection makes things easy."
2,One of the Worst X-Men Stories I've Ever Read,"I took a break from reading comic books for awhile... I started again, and this is the first X-Men book I picked up, because I'd heard good things about the title. Big mistake! The storyline is so ridiculous it's laughable. While Joss Whedan may be skilled at dialogue and conversation in TV shows, I found his efforts at it here to be weak ones... the book does not flow properly. On the plus side, the art here is pretty good... but with bad scripting and even worse story, it's just not worth it. I haven't read the first arc of the series, so I don't really want to pass judgement on it... but because of this mess it'll take a lot to convince me to pick up past books or future ones."
4,Great art & good story!!,"John Cassaday is the star here. His art is ridiculously good here. Whedon's script is good but the villain reveal is dissappointing because JOe Kelly & Steven Seagle did before, just not as good. Overall, still a good read!"
3,Good but not Great,The suction tube is too large around and too long. It doesn't cause as much lifting of debris as the one it is to replace. But it does work!
2,There Are Better Accounts of Jesse James,"This is a limited account of the exploits of Jeese James. The book is biased from family and pro James sentiments of the newspaper editor, and author. It is a revisionist work to place Jesse in a positive light. If you have one book to read on Frank and Jesse, get Frank & Jesse James, The Story Behind the Legend by Ted P. Yeatman. You won't be disappointed."
4,All I can say is WOW,"After just hearing this cd for the first time I am pleasantly surprised to find out that there are still guys out there who love jaw-dropping fusion like me. As a fusion-loving guitarist myself I was grinning from the first track. It is a little jigsaw puzzle-ish, but I find complex music like this very entertaining. Admittedly the influences are pretty obvious (Holdsworth, UK, Dream Theater, Bruford, et al), but it is done very well and has it's own uniqueness. If you like monster players playing monster fusion, I think you will like this cd."
5,best knife set i ever have,"I have a German knife set, it is pretty good. when i saw this deal, i bought it right away. no down..... I stick with these knife from now on..."
5,A Church of God in Christ Pastor,"This Music is fantastic. I am a COGIC pastor in Dallas. I pastor The Messias Church of God in Christ in Dallas. The life, pastorage, and bishopry of Bishop Samuell Kelsey has always been of interest of me. I understand that Bishop's church started very humbly in a tent. Over the years Bishop, I was told, sang, prayed, preached, taught, praised, and worshipped to the point of Temple COGIC became a beacon of light to so many. I thank God for pioneers in COGIC music like Bishop Kelsey, Sis. Lena Phillips Jones, Sis. Jessie Mae Sapp, Elder Utah Smith, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, etc. May the memories of Bishop Kelsey's ministry, rejoicing, singing, love for God's people, and preaching live on. God Bless!"
1,don't waste your money,"at least it was cheap. i read a great review of this somewhere but apparently that person hadn't actually seen the movie otherwise they would have known that 42 minutes into it the 'editor' (a term i use very loosely) cut back in 5 minutes of footage that had already been shown. aside from that, the interviews are random, the editing is incoherent, and the whole disc is a waste of 64 minutes. i threw it away as soon as i finished it as there's no one that i dislike enough to subject them to this waste of time and $12."
5,A superb read!,"A superb read! The author come across as being sincere and objective in his writing and reporting. He often tries to report views of opposite sides, that helps the readers to make sense of the situation and make their own judgement. Even in his grimiest account of the oppressive tradition, the author respects the Indian heritage instead of outright condemnation from a westerner's point of view. I enjoy reading the historic background of the many issues discussed. As the essays are written over a period of time, the author is able to track the development of the subject. This helps to present more than just a snapshot of the subject; the outcome of the subject often provide thought-provoking insight and perspective to the matter. The diversity of the issues in various political, cultural and social-geographical background reminds that the Indian sub-continent is mulitifaceted, one should keep an open mind and not quick to form one's perception of South Asia."
3,"Not so much travels, lots of encounters","There are only a few things I'd like to add to the existing reviews of this book:1. In this book Mr Dalrymple is not really a traveller/travel writer, but more of a political journalist. He visits various regions and discusses their political situation/problems, with an in-depth look at the Bhutto Dynasty in Pakistan wrapping up the book. If you're looking for travel literature about India, look elsewhere!2. In addition to the stories from a few chosen regions in India, the book also has quite a bit about Pakistan in it, as well as a visit to Reunion, which actually is a piece of French territory, very close to Madagascar. The link to India is fairly weak, and it seems as if it was just included to make the book sufficiently thick.For what it is, though, it's a decent piece of literature!"
3,"Kali. or Kali? or, Kali?","The writing is nice, to start with. After a while, it began to pall on me. I agree that William has traveled all over the sub-continent, and has met people from all walks of life. However, a book full of anecdotes about the crap that happens in the Indian sub-continent, South Asia, palls after a while. It is a little bit like ""Slum Dog Millionaire"", the guys who make the stuff get rich about writing about India's crappy side, a side that is not hidden from the world's view.In the English, the word ""Kali"" is confusing, I thought it was about the Goddess Kali, not about India's KaliYug. It certainly is not about the flower - Kali either!You cannot write Hindi in the English script and hope to achieve clarity.In my view, while well written, this book does not provide clarity about anything Indian."
5,constant companion,As soon as I get home I hit the play button and get on with my evening! Great DVD and I can't imagine getting tired of it!!
2,Boyd Gaines almost makes it worthwhile,"Mr. Gaines is an exceptional audiocassette performer, and he can make just about anything entertaining. Notice that I said ""just about anything."" This book, while original and daring in some ways, ultimately goes nowhere. The characters are carefully drawn, and then they do nothing. Hopefully Mr. Gaines' next reading will be more worthy of his talents."
1,A story that goes nowhere.,"I have read all of the Lawrence Sanders books and I found Guilty Pleasures exceptionally disappointing. The back cover of the paperback really tries to make the story sound like something you would enjoy reading. However, as I read it, I can't recall the emotional roller coaster ride promised. The story was flat, no excitement, no crime, stupid sex, no mystery, no nothing. This book should be recalled. The price of the book is a complete waste of money. This so unlike Lawrence Sanders that I wonder if it was He who wrote it."
1,"Pointless drivel, a complete waste of my time","I haven't read Sanders in many years, and now I know why. This is one of the worst books I have read in ages. The characters are shallow and uninteresting, the plot was pointless and the dialogue inane. No wonder it was on the shelf in the library."
1,Disappointing,"I think this is an awful book. I am more than half finished, and I've been amazed that nothing consequential has happened yet. The book is classified as a ""mystery,"" but half-way through there is still absolutely no sign of any mystery (or even a plot, for that matter). I decided to read these reviews hoping to find encouragement that the book gets better as it goes. Unfortunately, it doesn't look that way. All I've seen is very shallow character development for a bunch of characters I don't really care about. I'll probably finish (because I always do), but I'm afraid I'll view it as a waste of time when all is said and done. Thank goodness I borrowed this book, and it didn't cost me anything."
2,Lawrence Sanders can do better I hope!!!,"Unfortunately, for me, I found this latest read of L. Sanders to be a complete departure from his usual intriguing writing abilities....I prefer the McNally series, and hope desparately he comes back...after 18 years of reading all of his releases, I have now invested in hard cover books....Guilty Pleasures, to me was slow and the ending was poor....after all with today's societal norms on incest I found it very hard to believe this man could get on a boat and sail away from one of life's horrific situations that many children and adults live with....The characters initially had some luster then they became boring and predictable as well...overall I was disappointed with this...After living in Florida from 1992 through 1995 I became very aware of the Palm Beach and Florida coast line lifestyles....Mr. Sanders, there are ions of volumes you could write about the folks down in Florida.....Thank you...Bring back McNally and hopefully he'll marry Consuela!!!"
1,Positively the worst book I have ever read,"There is not one normal relationship in the whole book. I kept waiting for someone to realize that incest, homosexuality,etc. is wrong. I will never read another book by Lawrence Sanders."
1,I'M GOING TO MISS HIS EARLIER WRITING!!,"I gave up reading this type of book a long time ago. It's more of a Danielle Steele,Jackie Collins type of novel. I was so disappointed in Mr. Sanders - his McNally series is one of my all time favorites. I have loaned those books to many people and they all loved them. Guilty Pleasures was not a pleasure to read. I, like others, kept waiting for something to happen. At the end, I just closed the book and said to myself ""What a sad way to finish such a wonderful career. What were you thinking?!?"""
2,Disappointing,"When I got to the last page, I said is this it? What a dumb ending!! Mr. Sander's deadly sins novels were extraordinary, and then his writing style changed so drastically with the McNally series. However, the reading was always enjoyable. Now, this GUILTY PLEASURE is another writing style. Not to my liking and I can no longer buy his books based on his name only."
1,Decadence glorified -- almost,"In most Lawrence Sanders novels -- and I've read most -- the reader can connect in one way or another with the main characters. I was unable to feel anything for these characters. There was no connection and it's likely no readers would connect unless they themselves are involved in such decadent behavior. By the end I was left thinking ""Who cares?"" This was not Lawrence Sanders as we know him. It was almost as if he had a publisher's deadline to meet so he threw something together with little thought about direction. I will look forward to his next offering. It has to be better."
1,A limp handshake!,The book never developed into - anything. It's like a Seinfeld episode...only without the humor.
1,"Disjointed, pointless and pointlessly sordid","I think the title of my review says it all. I came across this book at a beach house where we were staying. Doesn't even qualify as a good ""beach read."" I derived no pleasure from this novel, guilty or otherwise. The only reason I kept reading was to see how many chapters it would take for a plot to develop. It never did. Stay away! Time is a too valuable a gift to waste."
2,A big diappointment for an avid fan of Lawrence Sanders,"I have been an avid follower of Lawrence Sanders' novels. I especially love all the McNally series. I have gotten to the point where I buy all his books sight unseen, as was the case with this new novel. What a sad disappointment I was in for. There was a great deal of build-up and foreshadowing, and you kept waiting and waiting for something to happen - but nothing does! The book seems as if it was published with half the book still unwritten. There is no conclusion to any of the individual storylines. It was an immense let down, and nothing was resloved. I cannot wait until the next McNally book. I will buy that one hardcover before it is even released! But I would not waste my money on this one."
1,A waste of time,"This book is a waste of time, trite, predictable and sorid. Shame on the author for throwing many of life's ugly aspects into one book. You can't help but think he had a contract for a book and simply looked for the easiest way to compile titilating issues; homosexuality, aids, incest, biracial relationships, infidelity, illness, back stabbing greed, etc. Nothing redeems this book."
1,Very disapointing,"Not much of a story line. Just a group of people that were involved in 'controversial activities' such as incest, inter-racial coupling, convienence marriages, etc. Did not enjoy."
5,Still the finest guide to emigration,"This somewhat dated book, last published 15 years ago, remains the best work on where to find a good home-country ... other than your own.From Canada to Kenya, Casey give a no-holds-barred description of dozens of countries including law, tax, opportunity and why each is a good or horrid place to live."
5,The Best Black Metal Compilation Ever,This compilation is COLD. It captures the essence of the early Black Metal Movement. Most of the tracks are great and some of them are rare or previously unreleased. The only track that sucks is Emperor-Moon over Kara Sher due to its complete lack of sound quality. The track by Abruptum - De Profundis Mors Vas Cousumet is the most evil track ever in my humble opinion. Hear it for yourself and you'll see what I mean.Raudt og Svart by Arcturus is a different more raw version than what you will find on Aspera Hiems Symfonia.Kingdom Comes by Mysticum is a very powerful hymn that will surely kickstart your evening :-)You'll find 'Dead' as the vocalist on both of the Mayhem songs whose voice I prefer over Attila who appears on de mysteris dom satanas.You just can't lose with this album because it's a true classic.
3,tetrarch review,"Arrived quickly, but in bad condition front cover torn and food stains inside!!Enjoyed reading Well of echoes series so much I went onto next Well of Tears. Got a bit boring towards the end, but satisfying reading."
2,Modern Spanish Grammar: A Practical Guide,"I got both the workbook and the textbook. I found them both confusing, with each item of grammar insufficiently explained. These books might work fine in a classroom setting with an instructor to clarify things, but I do not recommend them for use on one's own"
4,Great for the price,"The Bosch 443 ICON Wiper Blade is a great replacement for '07 and newer GMC/Chevy trucks with the NeoForm type wiper blade system. When this system first came out there weren't a lot of options for replacement wiper blades. The only replacements I could find were from the GMC dealership, where they charged an arm and a leg! ($60+ for a set to be specific!) Bottom line is these Bosch 443 ICON's fit my 2007 GMC Sierra with NeoForm wiper arms no problem! The only reason I am giving four out of five stars is that on the passenger side of the windshield the right edge of the wiper blade loses contact with the windshield ever so slightly. It's not enough to be a show stopper though. Final thought, Amazon.com has the best price! Look no further, this is what you need!"
4,"Flawless wipes, need a 19"" rear as well.","I bought these for my 2007 Tahoe. The perform flawlessly and are worth any extra cost. I have similar blades on our Acura TL and they have performed flawlessly as well. I really wish they sold a 19"" rear wiper in a 3 blade set. I have not found one other than the RainX.The driver side did pop off once inexplicably when I was cleaning the widow but I will chalk that up to user error."
2,Wiper blades for a 2007 Suburban,The blades fit the arms the same as the OEM blades and that is a plus. However at highway speeds the center of the blade loses contact with the glass. Switched blades and had the same result. Could be the arms don't exert enough downward force or wind force lifts center of blade. Dangerous situation.
1,Did not fit standard hook attachment,"I picked these up at AutoZone for a 2003 Cadillac SLS, which has standard hook attachments. The blades came with a single connector already attached that did *not* fit the standard hook style attachments on the SLS. I exchanged them for RainX Lattitides which cost less and fit right away out of the package. I noticed that the Lattitudes came with several replacement connectors, one of which was identical to the one used on the Bosch blades. The Bosch blades I purchased were unopened, so I assume they just come this way from the factory. Inexcusable for a $50 pair of blades. That was the first and will also be the last Bosch auto part I ever purchase."
3,Great table if you're on level ground,"I like this table very much. It is very easy to maneuver and move, as well as fold up and down. My only issue is that there doesn't seem to be any mechanism to compensate for an unlevel floor - I would have expected some kind of leveling mechanism, but there is none. As a result, the table tends to have a gap between the panels, and looks a little warped. I have a handyman friend who is going to install levelers, and then it should be fine, but I would have expected the manufacturer to anticipate this problem."
2,the bounce of the table is terrible,"this table took me about 2-3 hours to assemble. quality is OK. I like the idea of not removing the nets and post while in folding state.But the laminate surface really give very bad bounce for the ball. I just roughly measured the bounce of the ball free falling, it's on very low end or not meeting the standard I got from internet. I wanted to return it the next day after I tried. I didn't return it only because it's too much headache to de-assemble everything and put it back to the boxes.I wouldn't recommend it if you really love to play table tennis. The low bounce really take a lot of fun away from playing."
3,very complicated,I chose this particular table because it was supposed to be easy to set up..NOT. IT TOOK TWO PEOPLE many hours to do and the instructions were difficult to follow.
4,Very Informative,"I consider myself moderately tech savvy and although I had a few eBay transactions under my belt as a buyer and seller, I found this book very informative. I bought this and the dummy book and I found this one more helpful. I keep going back to this one to lookup for tips and tidbits. This book emphasis is on those who want to sell full time on eBay and it touches all the bases from taking pictures, equipment needed, helpful software, and more. It also offers great links to eBay and other sites to help you out. I really enjoyed that he profiles several successful full time eBay sellers and their stories. It's great to hear from those who are making it. If your trying to become a full time eBay seller like me this book should be on your desk!"
2,Obviously not an eBay Seller,"Although this book is more recent than the Dummies book of the same theme, it's clear that Holden is not an active seller on ebay. He stresses many things in the book, they do apply to home business, but a good deal does not apply to running a business on ebay.I was inspired and learned much more by Starting an eBay Business for Dummies, than with this book. There seems to be a major difference when a book is written by someone who is both a writer and a successful eBay Power Seller (as is the case with the Dummies book)."
1,Outdated as of now,"Note to potential buyer: the Lectionary has been revised and a new version is currently in press and available. Much of this is the same. I gave it one star only to alert would-be buyers. If using just for a study, or if your church is still using the old version, this would be perfect ... while your church awaits the new one in the mail ;-)"
5,comfortable,Very comfortable. Creates a nice smooth line under tighter fitting garments. Think I'll try the longer capri length next.
5,From the slacker school of noise rock......,"This record is a 43 minutes trip to a place where music is so noisy and sweet that it will give you cavities if you have it in excess. At the same time, their ringing guitars could pierce your brain with their trademark feedback. They are an excellent band which is not afraid of showing what they love, paying tribute to their favorite bands in their sound. They remind me of early Pavement (Slanted & Enchanted period) with their nonsensical lyrics, they have the classic guitar attack of a more childish Jesus and Mary Chain and their energy will make you dig into your records collection and play Sonic Youth's ""Sister"" over and over. This record deserves the medal of honor from the slacker school of noise rock."
2,Unfair to Indians,"I give the book 2 stars. It was a wonderful book except that it only describes the Indians as savages, not kind and friendly, like they usually are. How many times do you see ""Indians Bomb Russia"" on the news compared to how many times you see ""America Bombs Russia"". It is not fair to them. They are perfectly good people. Other than that I loved it."
5,The Matchlock Gun,"Edward's father goes away on militia duty for two days. On the second day, indians come to Edward's home while the father is away. Will Edward be able to stop the indians from killing his family? Read to find out."
3,boring beginning,This was an OK book but it's a one-sided story because we went to other countries and killed people too! Indians aren't as bad as we think they are. The beginning was really boring so I took away two stars but it got better! Overall it was a pretty good book!
5,pretty good book,"I thought the book was pretty good. Since it was so good I would give it 5 stars. When the reader was reading it at the beginning it was dull, but when she kept reading on it got better."
3,prejudiced,The Matchlock Gun was OK but I think Indians shouldn't be called savages because the Indians are just like us-- flesh and blood. I also think they should be welcomed. To be honest with you I think people who call them savages are savages themselves. I think it is sad for people to be prejudiced.
3,TRUSTWORTHY IN COLONIAL NY,"Set in Dutch Colonial NY State, this tale of homespun courage is gently paced for young readers, with accurate, historical detailing of life during the French and Indian War. When Father departs with the local militia, only young Edward is left to defend the family's humble farm and log cabin. His farsighted mother helps him position and load an old Spanish matchlock gun--just in case the Indians get through. But could a woman and two children survive an attack by Native Americans bent on murder, arson and revenge? What scene of devatation will await their father upon his return to the family homestead? Based on a true story of Dutch/American bravery, this short book is enhanced by Paul Lantz' vivid B/W and color illustrations. The theme--the inborn desire of people to be free to follow their own dreams and pursue happiness in their own way--reflects America's proud heritage of goal-setting and physical hardship in order to carve one's own path out of the wilderness."
3,It is a cool book,It is a Awesome book.It's not that adventurous though.I wish there was more action.The Matchlock Gun is a Good Title though.
4,I loved it!,"This great movie stars the beautiful queen of comedy, Lucille Balll, with another great comedian: Red Skelton. My favorite part of the whole movie turned out to be the last 10 minutes, so hang on to the end. This film's songs are really catchy and always get stuck in my head (espically ""Friendship"" which by the way Lucy also sung with Ethel (really Vivian Vance) in an I Love Lucy episode)"
1,A Stinker,"Sorry, kids, but this one is a real stinker, yet another in the long list of great Broadway musicals ruined by Hollywood. Nearly all the great Cole Porter songs have been removed and replaced by pallid imitations, Skelton and Mostel are horribly unfunny, and there's endless padding and weak jokes. Lucille Ball, though horribly miscast, is very good (the original was Ethel Merman, for heaven's sake!) looks lovely and does everything she can to save the situation, and Gene Kelly performs the standard Gene Kelly act.Avoid!"
5,An old time woodworker,"I am always looking for patterns to cut on my scroll saw and I must say I am really picky about the designs I decide to cut. I purchased this book for the wildlife designs and they are all top notch. You will not be disappointed with the quality Lora Irish, puts into her designs. I highly recommend this book. Its worth double its cost."
3,Scroll Saw Patterns,Purchased as a gift. Did notice that patterns would need to be traced and then enlarged in some instances.
2,A Night Too Long,"Erskine Caldwell's novel on Russian partisans behind German lines during World War Too is a simplistic book written at about a sixth grade level. Published in 1942, in light of history, it is a one sided view of the war between Germany and Russia. The Germans are evil and commit atrocities against the peasants, which was true, but the fact that the Russians were equally as brutal is not in evidence. Other than as a historical novelty, there is no reason to read this book. I finished it, because it was a short quick read, but would have missed nothing if I had not felt compelled to finish what I started."
5,Buy This,"BT has shaped the world of music in ways we cannot even know. This album, his first, was not really based on previous work by any artists. It is said that he made the music without knowing about trance or anything going on in Britain. The first cd is very good, but can get a little long, which is nice because the 42 minute remix by Sasha is pretty much a mix of the highlights of the first disc. Standout songs are ""Deeper Sunshine,"" ""Blue Skies,"" which features Tori Amos(!) on vocals, and ""Divinity,"" which closes out the album in grand style. Over two hours long, its quite the mouthful at first, but it is a very promising piece of music, with excitement for both the first time listener and the long time fan."
4,IMA get me some hope for better BT music,"This album isn't that variegated. It's interesting trance fare, covering most of the tracks, but the outstanding cuts are Blue Skies w/Tori. Alot of the tracks imitate sounds of nature, which often gets abrasive...if i want nature sounds, i'll stand outside. I love BT, and enjoy his taste...but i feel he didn't really stretch his musical mentality on this album, like he did on ESCM.For people who love BT, or just love different music...i'd get it. Music affects everyone differently, so what have you got to lose?"
5,I love this watch.,"I recommend this watch for everyone. It is perfect, feels great, and the look, feel and style of it on your wrist is excellent. The best money I spent within the last 12 months. Plus it cracks everyone up, or gives them a disgusted look. Great conversation starter. haha love it."
3,Casio Mens Watch Okay,I got it when they promised and in good condition. Keeps perfect time. It's a little smaller than I would have liked. I'm still trying to figure out how the alarm works will get it in due time.
2,Watch the watch,The band was too short and the light was too dim (it didn't cover the time display so that I could look at the time at night).
5,good watch,I bought this as a cheap watch to have while traveling just needed something to tell time and that was relativly water proof and this was perfect.
3,"Broken Strap, but I would buy it again","Had the watch for about six months until the plastic strap broke in the middle of the band. The watch still works and I could attach a lanyard and link it to my belt or keys, but then it wouldn't be a wrist watch. The spot where the plastic broke down is at a odd spot considering I rarely took it off, and that it was rare if ever bent at that specific area. It looks as if I had an poor quality strap and was just unlucky.My one grip besides the band breaking would be that the buttons are too easy to press. Anytime I bent my wrist and even laying in bed I would mistakenly press the buttons and would change the time or set my alarm to on. This was more of an annoyance.Overall I would buy it again but only because it was so cheap. 3 stars for having no expectations and low price point."
1,PESIMO,"Compre un reloj y me llego otro, el vendedor cambio la foto de la publicacion y me envio otro diferente al que compre. Persona irresponsable y mentirosa. Casio Men's W59-1V Classic Black Digital Watch OJO: LAS FOTOS NO SON REALES, NO REAL PIC OF PRODUCT."
3,Perfect watch except for the poor back light,"Light weight; easy to set. Stop watch and alarm. Military time. Date. But the back light is completely useless. What a BUMMER! If you don't need the back light, buy it. Otherwise, buy a different watch. UPDATE: I bought another watch for my son because I thought maybe my back light was defective, but the new watch has the same useless back light. I think I'll try to find a different watch next time."
1,band too short,"This watch does just what I wanted, basic time no frills, however it is advertised as a man's watch and the band won't fit around my wrist which I consider average [..]"
1,Too small,I was surprised to see how small this watch is. I did a double take on the description. Display is tiny. Strap too short to put on easily. Controls easy to figure out. I never read the instructions before I returned it to Amazon
4,Awesome,I bought this as a 7'' from my local record store for 3 dollars the other day. This is an average death metal ep and not much more then that. The vocals are kind of odd but its nice to hear something different. I would reccomend this to any Cannibal Corpse or Death fan.
3,Herbie The Love Bug is awesome!,"The first movie was very good. Herbie Rides Again was better than I thought. I give it 3 and 1/2 stars. Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo is okay, I give it 3 stars. So overall this set gets 3 and 1/2 stars.I like the older lady in Rides again, how a corrupt man is trying to get her evicted from her home, so they can sell her property for his greedy project. Herbie is protective of her, and I thought it was pretty good Herbie style.Herbie Goes To Monte Carlos is okay, Dean Jones and Donn knotts teaming up I thought would be enough to root for, but Dean Jones played a woman free character and this wasn't as likeable as the first movie."
5,A landmark,"There are some artbooks that can be considered landmarks of the genre and this is one such book. In 1986, Pierre Schneider, a respected French art critic for the French weekly L'Express, published this most important book on the greatest French painter of the XXth century and, in my opinion, it has not been equalled ever since. From the introduction (which is an in-depth study of the 1911 painting ""The Conversation"") to the last chapter centered on the late cut-outs, we are treated to a genuine firework of brilliant insight and marvelous reproductions. Every major work is analysed thoroughly and Matisse's life is followed with a host of erudite details (such as parallels drawn between Matisse's art and Proust's writings or Mallarmé's poetry)and all this makes this book not only a pleasure for the eye but also a great read."
3,"OK, not great","It works fine, but it's not what I expected. The material is not as soft as my other pillow cases. It also is a little small width wise and it turns my body pillow into a body log. It doesn't let the pillow flatten out. The stitching does look cheap, but it has lasted through at least a dozen washings with no ill effects. I'd give it a C or B-."
1,Rough fabric and cheap stitching,"These pillow cases are not of high quality fabric or stitching - not even for the $10 each price. I now only use them as ""liners"" under other, higher quality pillow cases. The fabric is very thin and rough, not soft to the touch at all. The stitching is cheap looking. Instead of a nice clean hem, the fabric was merely rolled and sewn. I would not recommend this product."
3,Pillow Talk,The pillow case was OK. It is always a challenge to get these very long body pillow cases to fit right. It hangs over the end of the pillow but is OK>
5,Best sleep ever!,"I have been looking for a great Body Pillow that did not cost a lot and found it on Amazon. It is just what I needed to Get the Great nights Sleep I had been Missing! Thanks You , Thank You, Thank You."
2,pillow,"The pillow is not all its cracked up to be. Either Amazon sent me the wrong pillow or the the wrong pillow case because the pillow case was way to big for the pillow. I was not impressed by this product and probably would not recommend this to anyone else that I knew.Sincerely,Edward Pilie ( unhappy consumer)"
3,"Beautiful, but small","I shouldn't have bought these without size listing--they're lovely, but much smaller than they appeared on the pic."
4,Fluid,The design and the fluid movement of this beautifully made earring really catches one's eye.Choose your desired metal and you're ready to go.I didn't give it 5 stars as they were a bit petite in size and weight.Thank You Mr. Mason.
4,This book will stay with you for a long time after you read it.,"Im not going to pretend that I read a lot because I dont, every once and a while Im browsing in a book store and something calls out to me READ ME. This is what the Society Of Others did to me. I dont want to tell you much about the book, I want to surprise you. The end will either shock you or go over your head. Its a book that you will have to read in between the lines. If you want a laid out obvious plot then read Tom Clancy but if you like books to effect you then read this. Its a heart racing hypnotic book of wisdom"
3,What?,"This book is engagingly written and contains some delightful set pieces. But I'm underwhelmed. It's difficult to shake the impression that the author lost interest in the project about two thirds of the way through. The narrator's character is deftly established at the outset, but his passivity and memory lapses quickly become irksome, and his later mental development is not altogether convincing. The last few chapters degenerate into an uninformative muddle through which one can hear the author faintly screaming, ""I want to stop writing this book RIGHT NOW!"" On the other hand, it's a quick read and worth dipping a toe into."
1,Bland,"The first song came on fast and furious, and I thought to my self, ""This is a pretty cool CD."" After about four minutes, the fun of listening to the same few rythyms over and over and over wore off, and i developed a headache. The problem with this album is that after about a minute, the songs just don't have anywhere to go, and they just start getting boring. The entire thing was bland and repetitive. I was very disappointed, having greatly enjoyed Bomb 20, also on the DHR label. The only thing Alec Empire will ""destroy"" is your brain cells if you listen to this album for too long."
5,I'm getting creamed every five minutes,"This is the music I always wanted. It's better than ATR. It's all the production and more without all the screammin. Don't get me wrong I love ATR, but he lets the beats and samples scream for him on this cd and it's just amazing! THERE IS TWO VERSIONS OF THIS ALBUM THE OTHER ONE (THE USA RELEASE I THINK) HAS A BLACK AND WHITE BACKGROUND AND A COUPLE DIFFERNT SONGS"
5,Alec Empire: TECHNO'S SAVIOR!!!,"Let's face it . Most drum 'n bass is bland and you know it! But one listen Alec Empire's classic ""The Destroyer"" and you'll be laying in a pile of your own brains after they've been splattered on the floor!! Alec rips your eardrums out, puts them in a meatgrinder and serves them for dinner. He is to drum 'n bass like punk is to folk music. Check out the track ""We All Die!"",it blends Alec's trademark ""buzz"" (sounds like a swarm of insane hornets) with hyper beats and distubing begging of a German girl. If you like Alec Empire's solo work, check him out with Atari Teenage Riot. Also, you should look into other Digital Hardcore Recordings artist such as Bomb20 and Shizuo."
1,bad copy,"the dvd I received is just a bad copy of, I'm thinking, a VHS tape. Its not at all sharp, and washed out. A real disappointment."
3,ricardo montalban fan,"I remember seeing a movies as this one,when i was younger.not much action but great under water shots. love to see ricardo montalban in action. looking forward to enjoying this one"
5,This was a very good book!,"I read 4/5 of it in one sitting in a library in Calgary when I was on vacation with my parents, and have never forgotten it...I`ll be reading the rest!"
5,"Oh, those eccentric sugarcubes","I love this band, and I love this album the most out of all of their work. Their quirks are on full view, and they just let go. Bjork is the vocal centerpiece, but if you want to hear her sing all the time, she has her own solo stuff, this is the band's music. Good old Einar's ramblings about Diesel and lobster make this music truly different from traditional pop music. I think the highlights are Tidal Wave, Speed is the Key, and Water. The whole album is fantastic though. Just buy it, hating it isn't an option."
3,I feel bad about this . . .,"I wish I could give this more than 3 stars, but I didn't like this one nearly as much as ""Life's Too Good"" and ""Stick Around For Joy."" Sorry Sugarcubes! :(""Eat the Menu"" was such a funny song; it was I think the best one on here. Try as I might, I just could not get excited about the other ones.The music is all very interesting, but for some reason I could not make it mine. ""Hey"" was the most interesting song musically.Fortunately, Bjork & Co. have left us with some other great music. Though I love Bjork and the Sugarcubes, I don't put this disk on the highest level."
1,Can't get into this,"I don't know WHAT happened when the Sugarcubes recorded their 2nd album, but this is some rough stuff. Their first album, ""Life's Too Good"", is great though. Besides Bjork, there are other worthwhile components to the band.See the facial expression of the little cartoon on the album's cover? He's being forced to listen to this album eternally."
4,"Speed up, Sims!","The Sims Vacation is a fabulous game, with several new items such as the Shower-Tub, Igloo, Campfire, and Waterslide. Social interactions are no longer just one thing, but are split into different branches. For instance, the ""Talk"" option can be either ""About Interests"" or ""Gossip-"" you choose!Another of the social improvements is dating. If you don't want the raciness of Hot Date, Sims can still call over their sweetheart and go on a vacation island date.The downsides? Vacation Island is incredibly slow and skips a lot. The actual houses are more prone to crashing. Also, more negative social interactions will pop up spontaneously. Just as Sim A is going to propose to Sim B, Sim B will jump into Sim A's face and ""Nag,"" about money, the house, or his rowdy friends. This sends the relationship for a dip and is also very frustrating.On the whole this is a great game with exciting new features that could revolutionize Simming."
3,Frozen!,"Perhaps it's just me, but Vacation installed successfully on my mac and everything looks fine and works fine until I try to actually play the game. My sims are paralyzed and time is standing still. Again, I'm not sure if it's a bug in MY program, or if it's going to happen to everyone. I look forward to others posting here- in the meantime, be aware that the game is unplayable if it happens to you too!(I give it three stars because I know if it worked, it would be wonderful. Somewhere between 0 stars and 5 stars, is three.)"
4,Great,I have been a John Wayne fan for years and I have seen these movies many times and still enjoy watching them in my own home. Great job! Keep the old westerns coming!!!
2,NOT for Americans,"This is a fantastic book, if you live in Europe and use the type of pyrography equipment that the author does. He does a wonderful job of explaining the techniques and features of the equipment he uses....However, if you are a beginner in the US and use the type of equipment that most beginners here use, you will be hopelessly lost and have no idea of what to do and how to get started.I have found the equipment he uses for sale on the web and as a beginner could not see myself ordering a $200+ system to learn with...It is a shame, because the information is fantastic, but without the right equipment, useless."
4,Don't buy both...,"I am new to pyrography and found the information in this book very helpful. It is presented in a clear and concise manner and the illustrations are also quite good. One word of caution, much of this material is from his other book, Pyrography Handbook. Don't buy both..."
3,Interesting diversions,"3 1/2PP is not without its moments of dramatic indie pretensions, but all in all it is a curiously satisfying disc which puts pianistic flights of fancy over guitar histrionics for unique, if not entirely compelling results."
1,NOt so Yummy,"I have been a fan for a few years. This album blows much ass. Who died and left the keyboardist the song writer. I am a huge fan of every album before, but this one is like morissey a b**ch. 90 days guitarist style was the perfect accent to Rob's (bassist) howl and the drums were perfect. The album needs the keys to be electric like thier live shows. See them live if you can. Silver and Snow is the worst song in thier catalog besides that bear song on ""to everybody"". Andy is tone deaf and the lyrics are more primadonna than say.....Madonna. Me and my friends listen to that song to laugh, or clear a room. Check out thier previous two albums, they are amongst the best out there, but don't start here."
5,I'm the writer/producer/director,"Growing up, people are told things like: ""You must love yourself"" and ""you are special"". This might cause a society of self-entitled, narcissistic, and generally annoying people. Lionel is one of them. His views of love, life, and career are skewed by a feeling of entitlement which leads him to the inevitable slap-in-the-face known as harsh reality."
5,so8os is soooooo cool!!,so8os is soooooo cool!!I can't wait for Patrick's next book...I wanted more and more and more...
5,so8os ROCKS!...A Tribute to NYC Nightlife!!,"I believe this to be the largest collection of an amazing and often, forgotten genre in photography: Nightlife documentation; like Weegee, Patrick McMullan relentlessly documented a historical and iconic era: the 1980's. From the nightclubs to the NYC streets that once contained freedom and reckless abandonment -- he photographed the legends, the artists, the musicians, both the ""some-bodies"" and the ""no-bodies""...It's an enormous body of work: 432 pages with well over 500 B&W photographs... an extremely important book to have in one's collection!! Great for any collector and anyone who loved or lived in the 1980's!!!"
3,Grand Theft Parsons,"This movie surprisingly had great cinematography, screenplay and was well carried-through by all cast members. While it succeeds in being subtly humorous, the main plot of a corpse being transported by stolen hearse from LA to Joshua Tree, CA is perhaps too morbid to begin with, especially since it's based on the actual death of the `70's `Alternate Country Western' singer Gram Parsons, September 1973. But overall, I believe these offbeat, low-budget, independent film-makers often present interesting stories, otherwise not available. Unfortunately, without the budget for studio voice-overs, the audio fades in some crucial dialog points. However, this film includes actor summaries and is well acted by the primary 3 players, Johnny Knoxville (Phil Kaufman), Christina Applegate (Barbara) and Marley Shelton (Susie). And it soon delivers as a true, picturesque, hippie `road-trip' style flick, which I automatically enjoy."
1,Ruins a good story -- big disappointment,"The screenplay writer Jeremy Drysdale ruined this lovely story. I can only surmise it's due to ego and money. In any case, his botching of this fascinating story must be why the movie never made it into theaters for more than a day. The fictitious characters are silly and/or unrealistic, and Gram's father is nothing like the real thing (why?). Read Phil Kaufman's autobiography, Road Mangler Deluxe, for the true account and to get to know Gram Parsons (who is basically just a stiff in the movie version) and the others involved.The only redeeming qualities of the movie are the nature shots at beautiful Joshua Tree and a great job by Johnny Knoxville."
4,A great fun ride!,"I liked this movie a lot.It's fun and it's meaningful. I saw it in London at a sold-out screening, and it went down a storm.I would recommend it to all..."
2,Original story lost in lousy movie,"Recently I purchased Gram Parsons' Complete Reprise Session, which is great, and then heard that a movie had been made about his terrible death. What I ended up with is this junk. I give it two stars because of its attempt, albeit feeble, to tell the Parsons' corpse theft story. I don't give it any more stars because it is a bad movie -- lousy acting, stupid script. I haven't felt this sick since watching Forrest Gump."
1,Hot Flying Flop #1,"The truth at the center of this story is far more compelling than the shallow retelling here. Artistic license should yield a more substantial script at the very least. The male leads rise above the writing, but they can only take it so far. Why ignore the complex relationship between GP and his stepdad and Phil's reaction to that? Isn't that where the story is? The following documentary does a better job at sifting through the true story and setting the right tone.Gram Parsons - Fallen Angel"
2,not a comedy,"I saw the trailer for this movie a couple of weeks ago and it looked very funny. Let me be clear on this. This movie is not a comedy. All the funny parts were in the trailer. The actors did a wonderful job, and it's a very interesting story. The production was very good also. However, being that I went into this expecting it to be a comedy, or at the very least humorous, I was completely disapointed. This movie is NOT A COMEDY, nor is it even funny most of the time. At the very least, it has a couple of pretty funny parts, but that's it."
3,Relax,"I'm a Grampire as well but folks have to realize that this is a movie - meant for entertainment. If folks are fans of Gram they should be happy that he even made it to the big screen outside short cameos in Gimme Shelter and The Trip. As for complaints that the movie lacked character development of Gram and Phil's relationship, well during the period of time the movie covered, Gram was dead and still is. Of course there were some licenses taken with the facts, but again, it's a movie. While I'm a Gram fan, I also realize that he is not so sacrosanct that there cannot be entertaining value to his legacy."
1,"One of the worst, most needlessly inaccurate - EVER.","The original story is so grand and rich - WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO TAKE LIBERTIES WITH IT?This is seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen, subject matter aside. The details are useslessly misarranged and the cast performance is simply garbage. Garbage.Don't bother. Don't buy.From a non-fan's p.o.v., there's nothing interesting about it, aside from the fact that you know it's BASED on a true story. If you can get past the vomit-inducing laziness of the production go read the real story and you will ask yourself ""why didn't they just directly shoot from this?"""
1,disappointing,"I'm a huge fan of Lily Tomlin and was totally disappointed with this video. Supposedly a paraody of a Las Vegas show, it is so slick that it *becomes* one of those cheesy Las Vegas shows! I didn't laugh once :-("
1,Fragrance doesn't last,"Compared to Polo 'green' cologne, the fragrance of Polo Double Black QUICKLY disappears. Polo Green lasts all day. Ralph Lauren needs to fix this. The Double Fragrance is great. But, RL needs to do something that will make it last as long as Polo Green. Until then, I'm going back to Polo Green.Very disappointed in this product!"
5,Sophisticated but not stuffy,"Polo Double Black is a well done cologne of the oriental spice variety - very similar to Armani Code. I think I like Double Black a little more, since it doesn't quite have the same bite that Armani Code has. Both have a similar wood base note, but this has a softer mango scent to me. I think this one is more versatile and laid back for that reason.Overall, quite a classy and professional scent with decent longevity and projection."
5,A fragrance to be enjoyed,Received the Double Black just as the old spray container ran out. The Double Black was packed carefully and received with no issues.Doug
4,Double Black,"I have wanted to get this cologne for awhile, I like the subtle masculine scent! A great cologne for anytime!"
5,Phenomenal,I used the same cologne for a couple years (Cool Water Deep) but as soon as I smelled Double Black I knew what my next puchase would be.
5,Just what Daddy ordered,"Husband ran out of his Ralph Lauren Double Black while we were staying in a small town without department stores; so, Amazon to the rescue! Product price was fair and it was delivered pronto and in great condition. Thank goodness for internet shopping."
5,A must-have book,"Many alternative health books are written haphazardly. Nenah Sylver's books are written professionally. Simply stated, her books speak to years of dedicated study and hundreds of hours of diligent research. Dr. Sylver's incredible resources have quickly become the standard reference guidebooks for sauna therapy and rife treatment. In fact, without Dr. Sylver's books, much of the information related to these topics would be unknown and unpublished to the public in the U.S. and abroad.I highly recommend Nenah Sylver's books. They have contributed greatly to my healing journey, my writing, and my big-picture knowledge of alternative health treatment options.If you haven't already, check out Nenah's other book: ""The Holistic Handbook of Sauna Therapy.""Bryan RosnerAuthor, ""The Top 10 Lyme Disease Treatments"" and""Lyme Disease and Rife Machines"""
4,Very good,"Dr. Nenah, Sylver PhD really has done a very hard work gathering these informations. I learned (am still learning ) many new information from this book. For example Grayfiled optical site was awesome. I wonder why Ergonome microscope was not even discussed in medical school? I am so angry that all my education in under grad and med school, we were only given 1500 magnification microscopes or Electron microscope for dead specimens. Never anybody even mentioned Ergonome and seeing live microbes at least at 8000 times larger in natural environment.The tone of the book was a little too angry towards MD/ DO practicing physicians (Which they are also victims but daily are doing what they are allowed) and also on page 29 Tamiflu was mentioned as a ""vaccine"" under the politics of the flu section .Otherwise everything else was excellent and I feel it would take me a life time to gather this much information and I have to thank her for such a hard job.Dr T."
1,"Poorly organized, rambling book- avoid","This book is not well done. It jumps between time periods and has random (extremely detailed) rambles about obscure people, while neglecting to demonstrate any clear ""cause and effect"" between events. I've read other history books; American history does not have to be this confusing. Even the wording of the sentences is painful and there is no discernible thesis, or indication of what information is ""interesting"" background and what one should actually care about.It might be okay if you are doing some course that really focuses on obscure people/events while ignoring the ""big picture."" Otherwise- avoid this. It's really painful."
1,why bother using it?,"its better to not use any...the size feels very small and uncomfortable, it also breaks easily...seriouslymy wife banned me from using it anymore...thats how bad it is"
5,It's pumping,"Installation was easy on the 2000 crown vic police int, the bosch water pump I think was a vey good buy, the price for this pump is very reasonable and it's working great after a couple of months so far. I did do a system flush and put new fluid, that's very important do get the most life out of pump.Looks good too."
2,City Secrets is not an easy read,"If you're looking for a guidebook, this probably isn't the best choice. The book reads like a series of short essays and opnions about Rome sights, but doesn't provide much practical information. I wasn't able to get through the entire book even though it's small. The gray print makes it difficult to read in any less than perfect light. There may be some interesting facts in it. I just wasn't able to make my way through the payges to get to them."
2,Contains no secrets,"The title is misleading. This book contains no secrets, but merely erudite opinions about very commonly visited sights and attractions. The book is tiny and lovely at first glance-- it might make a pretty gift, but it is in fact hard to read because the type is light and tiny, the paper translucent.It is not really a guide book, but more of an introduction to the possibilities of Rome. You could maybe use it to whet your appetite before you leave, but even as small as it is, leave it at home and bring a better, more complete guidebook in its place."
2,Hard to read and of limited use,I don't recommend this book for the average person. The type is teeny tiny and in pale greyscale against a vellum background; very artsy but impossible to read. The content is comprised of personal opinions by academics and artists.
5,Great Rome guide,"This is an excellent guide, with entries by a variety of Romaphiles who know the city. The scope of their ""secrets"" is very helpful. The reader will find some true treasures."
5,Homesick,"I studied in Europe for the past fall semester and spent a total of 2 weekends in Rome which was not nearly enough. I feel that Rome is now my city and I plan to go back as soon as possible. this book not only made me homesick, but it also gives me many places that I want to see that i had missed or didn't have time to see the first 2 times. This book was absolutely marvelous!"
5,Christoph de Babalon - if your into it i'm out of it,"""if your onto it, i'm out of it is"" one of DHR's best releases. from the dark and moody strings and ambiance to the hypnotic whirlwind drum breaks makes this album a can't miss for any lover of forward thinking music!!! i hav my double LP do you?i only wish that Alec Empire an Christoph de Babalon would get-to-gether and collect all of Christoph's work he put out on DHR, but i don't think it will ever happen."
5,Prelude to Dark Breakcore,"This Digital Hardcore Records alumni's first full length album offering is a surprising collection of ambient, darkcore, jungle, and breakbeat. The opening track ""Opium"" is a 15 minute beatless ambient piece that is surprisingly beautiful. While tracks like ""No Step"" and ""Dead (Too)"" have a breakbeat feel to them. Another surprising track is the acid jungle of ""Expressure""The dark, almost gothic, tone of the album is what is really amazing. The clarion bell of ""My Confession"" is a prime example, and along with ""What You Call A Life,"" a highlight of the album. If you are a fan of DHR's artists then Christoph De Babalon will be a wonderful addition!"
5,Spooky music is hard to find,"Excellent music that sets a creepy mood is tough to find these days; even with a million electronic bands that try to do just that. Mick Harris from Lull, some Coil, Lutefisk on Bong Load do it fine... But THIS thing is a 70 minute nightmare. Beats go in and out, sounds rumble deep but flip around. You won't fall asleep at the wheel if you're listening to it, but you'll start seeing eyes in your rearview and maybe won't feel like swerving to miss that hitch-hiker."
4,"Great pictures, awkward handling","Positive stuff first: I can't argue with the picture quality. I have only put one roll of film through it, but the images came out sharp and with good colors both at the widest setting and the longest telephoto setting.Negatives: I'm not a fan of the ergonomics. The sliding cover on/off switch is okay for switching on but a bit unnerving when switching off because you have to slide it just enough to make the lens to retract, wait for that, then slide it completely closed. The popup flash is annoying because it's right where I try to hold the camera while operating the on/off switch, and it also gets in the way of using both hands on the camera while shooting. The viewfinder isn't especially sharp either, presumably because it's a compromise for both close and long range viewing.But so far I can't argue with the quality of pictures the camera takes."
5,Couldn't be happier with it,"My son was 18 months old when he was put on this drink. He had a mild to moderate allergic reaction to cow's milk protein, which caused him throwing up quite often. It's always been a struggling for us, as a parent, to keep the weight on him (he's always on the 20th percentile). Then the dietary specialist recommended this drink to us and said if he can drink 5 cans per day he'll gain weight even without eating anything else. This is the only milk (soy/cow milk) that provides 30cal/oz.It took a little bit time to migrate him from cow's milk to soymilk. We started out from 1oz then gradually added up, now we mix 4oz can with 4oz regular SILK. He goes through 2 cans per day. And he's up to 50-60% on weight at 2 years old and he's not thrown up since then, nor has he been sick either. We highly recommend it. We hope to be able to buy it from the regular grocery store though."
3,"walmart makes the same drink, cheaper!","I ordered this drink for my son who was diagnosed with milk allergy and failure to thrive at almost 2. Before purchasing I read the other reviews and wanted to share they were helpful. Like the others my son likes this drink a lot and he doesn't like any thing a lot. I wanted to share that like many others I was concerned about the cost. While picking up my baby supplies at walmart I took a look at their selection on pediatric drinks, they have the same product! Its a vanilla soy pediatric drink. It is about 30 cents cheaper per can so about 2 dollars per 6 pack. Im not sure if every walmart will carry it or if its free shipping online. But I wanted to share that I found another option. My son doesn't seem to notice the difference between the drinks."
3,Apparently delicious. Maybe too delicious.,"The only problem I have with this drink is that it's so sweet and yummy that my little one refuses to drink anything else. It got to a point where he would even refuse to eat and just wanted to drink this all day long. We started giving him this drink because he was a picky eater to begin with, and he got much worse in terms of variety of foods he would eat when he knew this drink was in the house. So we had to wean him off this drink for fear he would never try new foods again. This is not entirely the fault of the drink of course, but it was just counterproductive for us unfortunately because it's so sweet. It was absolutely great to have this with us on the go and to be able to give it to him when he skipped a meal because of his pickiness. In the short term it certainly helped with weight gain, but in the long term it seemed to make him even pickier."
5,Great,"My son loves this, he has a dairy allergy and is not gaining wt well. It is hard to find high calorie options."
3,Can Lined with BPA!!,"I called the number on the back of the Bright Beginnings package, and they confirmed that these cans are lined with BPA. So when we give our kids these drinks, there is a very real possibility that they are ingesting traces of BPA, which is so NOT GOOD! Having said that, my baby has severe food allergies and really needs to gain weight. I am giving the drinks to him because he really needs the calories, and he loves them- he will drink 2 of these cans a day, and he is a very picky eater. I do not know of another product out there like this, as I would love to switch to a drink that does not line the cans with BPA. If you know of one, please let me know!"
4,Nice Lamp for the Price,"Not many lamp fixtures at this price point allowed the use of incandescent bulbs rated over 60W (this lamp is rated for 100W). That may not be an issue for many people given the shift to CFL and LED alternatives, but I have a dimming system I wanted to use with these, and I wanted the ability to have the light be very bright as well. The switch is not a 3-way.The fixture itself looks decent, with very nice-looking wood. The lamp shade doesn't look bad, and still lets plenty of light out."
5,Great book,"I loved this book. Margaret Laird used to come to our church in Detroit when I was a child and tell amazing stories, many are in this book. She was an amazing woman, we loved her! A good choice to read this. She had great faith and will inspire yours for sure!"
5,5 Stars for Mikey!,"With the exception of climb to safety (which i personally cant stand), this is an amazing DVD. Great video and sound quality throughout. The band is really on their game and Mikey brings the house down during Space Wrangler. Driving>Surprise Valley>Driving is another gem. Panic will never be the same as it was with Houser but they are sounding pretty good now that Jimmy has settled in. The boys get 5+ stars for this one. Thank you Austin City Limits and Brown Cat for releasing this. Go see this band!"
5,It's STILL good!!!!,"I saw The Sugarcubes when I was a freshman in college in 1989. They rocked then and this cd is a great old stand by...I've had to replace it many times since it came out because friends that I would introduce Bjork and the boys to would steal it from me. I never cared about replacing it because I was able to share some good music with my good friends. No matter what new comes out, this cd stays in my rotation. What are you waiting for?!?!?!? MILK AND BISCUITS??? Seriously, this is much more entertaining than the music that Bjork records today. When she fronted The Sugarcubes, Bjork was one cool chick from Iceland. These days she's just odd."
5,How Original!,"Before Bjork the solo artist, there was THE SUGARCUBES, the most internationally famous and idiosyncratic punk/pop groups that ever hit from Iceland. The album's title exemplifies the music itself: it's simply too good. Each song infuses the elements of what makes The Sugarcubes: fun, corkiness, idiosyncratic behavior, unique rhythms, beats, and harmonies, sometimes abstruse and profound lyrics, and eerie, soft, and melodic singing (and sometimes wailing). At the end it all turns out into some wild rollercoaster ride through the corky and wild world of The Sugarcubes. I have been a Bjork fan lately, but now i am even happier that i can get back to Bjork's creative and musical roots by listening to the Sugarcubes. I recommmend this to anybody whose a fan of Bjork, or anybody that's interested or curious in hearing a new twist to punk/pop music."
5,gorgeous madness,"Life's Too Good is an astoundingly original record. God knows what they were thought of in Iceland when they first started out. It holds so many moments of perfect pop music, be they edgy, mellifluous or surreal. Bjork contorts her voice even more than she has done in her solo career. 'Birthday' is the high point in this regard. While the goonish ramblings of Einar Orn made subsequent Sugarcubes albums unnecessarily patchy, his contributions on this, the debut album, come off as inspired and spectral commentaries on sideburns and stuff like that. Its not to be dismissed lightly. Imagine a bunch of loopy 1980s Beck types isolated in the North Sea making music to make the halibut boogie."
4,"Psychotic, demented fun.","The seventeen songs on Life's Too Good each have their own distinct sound - modern rock infused with a shot of ... well, something that's probably illegal. Lead vocalist Bjork Gudmundsdottir alternately sings, warbles, and screams the vocals to the songs, often going from one extreme to the other in the space of a second. Backing vocalist, trumpet player, and rampaging werewolf Einar Orn is her counterpart on most tracks (listen to the song 'Dragon' if you question my description). The Sugarcubes do sound a bit like the B-52s in some places, but their sound is totally unique, and 11 years later still fresh and electrifying. A great CD for anyone who wants music that's really on the edge."
5,beautiful watch,I'm using it more than 6 months now and i must say simply love it... yes it may be difficult to read because of low contrast difference but it's not that important..
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this item based on reviews and advertised quality. Sorry to report that the thing lasted me less than a year. I'm a hobbyist gunsmith/tinkerer, and although I did use it 3 to 5 times a week, I never abused it. It just came apart. I bought another brand that was a little more exspensive, but I haven't had a lick of trouble with it. Just my opinion of course, but I would look at other brands before this one."
4,A functional gun vise for the budget minded rifle enthusiast,A functional gun vise for the budget minded rifle enthusiast.PROS:Adjustable padded foam clamps that will accommodate different sizes of stocks and forestocks. I use this for my AR 15 and it has no problem holding it's tactical handguards.The forestock rest/ clamp can be adjusted to the desired height with a single turn of a knob.The base has 6 rubber support pads on the bottom so it's safe to lay it on glass or tile surface.It has 2 drawer compartments where you can keep small cleaning tools and patches.CONSI wish it came with an adjustable middle support base to easily tilt the rifle to the desired angle.CHECK OUT MY PICS!
1,...,I bought the thinking it would help me out well; when you go to adjust it it doesn't work right. The clamps suck.
2,anti-climactic,"I've really enjoyed this series until this last DVD. The detailed characters, mecha design, rich plot, conspiracies, reference to biblical themes, etc. made for a very original and exciting series.If you liked the ending of 2001, you will probably like the last two episodes. Where you expect some kind of real conclusion you're presented with Shinji going through some inner journey of self discovery--dealing with the gambit of philosophical issues from what is truth to the nature of reality. While these episodes are intellectually stimulating, they're a bit too much and definitely make a disappointing ending. After investing 10+ hours with the series, you would like to have some kind of conclusion and some answers to the many questions posed in the movie. Though, I guess there is some kind of conclusion in another NGE movie.Overall, I give high praise to the series, but the ending is just anti-climactic and disappointing."
2,Good Story... Wait a minute! That wasn't a story!,"Okay, I thought NGE was generally a good series with its high points and low points. I also had heard that the ending was sheer brilliance, which was true in a sense. For those of you who are wondering, the first episode on this DVD is really the final episode of the series, the other two are just an unexplained entrance into Shinji's mind. My god the kid is such a woman. He's obviously never heard the phase ""Deal with it!"". Sure he's got deep seeded mental issues, but he is by far not the most psycologicly tormented character on the show. So I guess my main point is why do we care? I would've been much more satisfied with an ending that actually explained the many interesting little secrets of the show. But to each his own I guess."
3,Sometimes its good and sometimes its not,"This series is a bit Confusing at times. The fight scenes are superb but rare. I was expecting more fighting. Most of the time the characters are dealing with mental problems or thinking about sex. If you like weird twisted anime, then you will love this. The first disc was great. However, it slowly started to change."
5,Not Your Typical Ending (spoilers),"While some have raised the legitimate argument that episodes 25 and 26 represent an unnatural departure from the theme of the rest of the TV series, I believe that Anno's vision of the last episodes fits in perectly with what the show is really about: how human beings interpret themselves and how they interpret others.The last two episodes delve into the mind of Shinji Ikari as he finally grasps the true meaning of his existence and questions his true motives behind piloting his EVA despite the trauma it inflicts upon his fragile mind.In summary, this is a series that questioned what it means to be human and our motivations. Highly reccomended.""I am I."" - Rei Ayanami"
3,Not quite what I had expected...,"Though of my relatively young age, I'm very interested in complicated anime such as Evangelion. During the beggining of the series, mainly episodes 1-15, it seems like your normal anime. Of course, it stands above the rest. Once you get past episode 20, however, prepare for a mindblow...you either gotta be really smart or on drugs to understand some of this. I really despised the original ending to Evangelion.Congratulations? Don't make me laugh.I'm a christian, and I felt alot of the biblical references made me understand more to the story than a non-christian would.The whole mind trip thing was presented well, but that still SHOULDNT have been the ending.Ah, thank the director for End of Evangelion. My suggestion is that you stop at episode 23, then watch EOE."
2,Good series - but only 3 episodes per dvd...,"This is an good example of a truly amazing anime being treated quite badly on DVD. Why only put 3 episodes on the last six discs when you can easily fit six episodes onto one disc. As usual it is money, I hope this is not the continuation of the anime trend on VHS when they only had 2 episodes per tape...! Anime fans will buy this whatever - and publishers know this and use it. What a shame they could not treat this series as well as Outlaw Star, martian succesor or Saber Marionette J."
5,A Perfectly Realized Vision,"Deeply philosophical, and a very reaffirming ending to a series which had so many dark twists. A perfect end to a perfect series. The last two episodes on this disc (#25 & 26) were remade into a two-hour movie, Evangelion: Death & Rebirth, which is going to be released on U.S. DVD in October, I think, along with the other movie (The End of Evangelion) which is a two-hour reprise on the series up to episode #24. These are the very best episodes of the series, right here, so order it, make some sushi nori, get a bottle of saki, and sit down for a life-changing experience."
2,Great Series Ends in Pseudo-Intellectual Mush,"Too bad. Up through episode 24, this was classic anime with great action balanced by interesting delineation of characters. The last two episodes seem to reflect a bad experience with an introductory college course in psychology. It's rambling, dopey, and trite. The rest of the series is five stars, the conclusion does not measure up."
2,What a lame ending to an awesome series...,"Evangelion was a great series. It started off fast paced with excellent art and drawing. The story was odd, different, and had lots of bizzare imagry and symbolism that hooked it's audiences. Everything is going great until the LAST DVD! If you're looking for an explanation for the ending of this series, or in fact ANY of the imagry in the series, you won't find it.And if you're waiting for an explanation from the 2 movies, don't bother. ""End of Evangelion"" is just like the series, brilliant until the ending (brilliant enough to watch, just beware). The last quarter of the movie (and espically the ending) really stunk. Bottom line, the series rocks, the end [stinks]. Big time."
1,Intel Mac-users beware,"This game predates the Intel Mac computers by only a few years, and I was unaware of the fact that it was designed for the older machines; having struggled for quite some time with the game, I was informed that it would only run on older Macs, not Intel machines. Jedi Outcast is an excellent game, but if you really want to play it, you'll just need to get a PC or a Gamecube, unless you feel like backdating to an older Mac."
5,Such a help after losing a pet,"This book not only touched my heart, it completely changed my perspective on how I felt after our dog was put to sleep.Until I read ""Best of Both Worlds,"" all I could think about was how much we missed him, and he missed us. Now I think about him running around with his parents, who he hadn't seen since he was a baby, and with other dogs we have owned and loved in the past.I also read it to my children, and now when they talk about him they use the language of the book, and even glance up and say hello to him occasionally.I cannot recommend it highly enough as part of the healing process!"
2,Basic good story marred by too many implausibilities,"While much of the basic historical plot of this story was good, the contemporary portion was filled with so many annoying implausibilities, I lost interest. First, how come the researcher kept discovering info in the chronicalogical order of his subjects lives? Hardly likely. Second that the Baker Estate apparently existed in trust without any actual heirs/owners, and that the lawyer with control of the estate didn't just get the papers she wanted and had access to, but constructed an elaborate plot to get a researcher to basically steal them from her--please. The fish out of water Easterner in the West also rang false as did almost all the modern relationships. Sorry."
3,Sweet,"I bought this album because I'd heard Hezekiah Jenkins's ""The Panic Is On"" on NPR. Really, Jenkins has the best music on the CD, but there are some other gems here. I'd recommend you buy this just to hear him belt it because I can't find this song elsewhere. Honestly, though, I don't listen to the rest of the music on here. Some of the recordings are so poor you really can't understand what they're saying -- to be expected, of course, in a collection called ""obscurities"" but nonetheless not worth incredibly much to someone who isn't researching, restoring, or replaying the music."
2,"No information on Cosmopolitan Doll & Toy Corp's. ""Ginger""","Even though Kathryn Kay was mentioned as a former Vogue Doll employee, her doll ""Ginger"" by the Cosmopolitan Doll & Toy Corp. was not illustrated and with absolutely NO information. This book is otherwise recommended for Vogue dolls only."
3,The jury is still out...,"There are not enough cleansing wipes included to use the product more than a few times. Both times I tried it so far, I was unable to get all the hair to lift out-even with a few attempts each time. The second time I used it the results were worse than the first time I used it. I am not sure that the ""No-Heat"" part really is working with your body heat enough. I will try it a few more times, but the gel is hard to apply the right amount-but then again I am a beginner."
3,Good idea but...,"Good and Bad. Good is easy to ""paint"" on. Bad is not many strips are provided, and it doesn't get all the hair. It is a good idea, they just need to improve the product a bit."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"When I received my Nads hair remover, it was practically solidified in the bottle. Maybe Amazon simply sent me an old product that should have been taken off the shelf a long time ago. Or maybe it's a bad product. Whatever it was I received, it was not good; and at the very least I have to suggest that you don't buy it from Amazon. I tried applying it, and it didn't work at all, so I threw it away. For $5.99 I wasn't going to go through the agony of return/exchange."
4,Good product,Be sure to follow the directions closely. It gets the fine hairs on the face but has trouble with the darker hairs that some women get as they get older.
2,Great at first,"I bought this hoping to find a better alternative to waxing. At first I was impressed - easy to use, easy clean up, great. Problem, after about 6 weeks - the nads in the bottle became hard and didn't work well at all. I am going to try Moom next - read about it here on Amazon. Will write a review of that when I have used it a few times."
1,Didn't work like store bought product for some reason,I've used this same product for years and it has worked wonderfully for me. I couldn't find it in the stores anymore so I ordered it through here. For some reason though this item received from amazon did not work at all. Will not buy through amazon again.
2,Works best with experience,It takes a few times to get the amount of wax you need to apply just right. I used this for my eyebrows and it takes a considerable amount of wax to work. At first it works fine but over time like other reviewers on here the product becomes harder and harder to spread and doesnt stick to the strips and thus does not remove any hair. I had to heat it up by putting it up to my desk lamp which softened it. I definitely reccommend wax products but not this one
2,Good book - Useless Index,"Since I'm planning a future birding trip to Washington state, I purchased this book as a reference for planning and executing my trip. I own several ""Falcon Guides"", and have found them all to be very informative and useful, until now. The information within this book is excellent, but finding what you want is VERY difficult. I can't believe anyone would publish a book/guide such as this and not include any place-names in the back-of-the-book index!!! The index is comprised entirely of bird names. Every other Falcon Guide I own has place-names in the index. Where was the editor on this?"
5,Simply a Masterpiece,"Shania Twain's name means ""I'm on my way"" in the language of her Native American step-father. There is no argument there; she is definitely on her way. This song has an excellent musical foundation, and the lyrics tell one of the most romantic love stories. Think of this song as a long-distance relationship. It is hard; people have their doubts, but in the end, it's glorifying. Shania is making her career sour to new heights. This song is breaking all barriers. It is country at heart, but its ability to take over pop radio is clearly evident. Exploring the song's significance, one will find that this song defines true love. Surely one of the best songs ever written, Shania is not done yet. Just wait; she has only started on her way to success. Don't let her pass you by!"
4,An interesting viewpoint,"I found this book to be a very interesting if unflattering take on Andrew Jackson. The title is revealing-this book is primarily intersted in what made Jackson tick. This isn't done with new age psychoanalysis but by looking behind the actions Jackson took. Thus there is considerable time spent on Jackson's duels, physical confrontations and his political battles. Because of this there may be an imbalance in the book towards the negative actions Jackson took-such as his duels, disregard for military or political authority and his actions towards even his allies among the native americans. However the book makes it clear that it was these very traits that made him the General and President that he was. For a more positive and comprehensive book on Jackson read Brands book. Beter yet read them both."
4,THERE'S HOPE FOR LUCY.,"Bob is cast in his usual one-dimensional character as theatre critic Parker Ballantine - who must review his wife's new play!...With the comfort of booze, analysis, and the comfort of his first wife (Marilyn Maxwell), Bob labouriously decides to pen a review...Arriving drunk at the opening, and himself immediately being the center of attention, Lucy takes the expected measures, which lead to a comical - if routine - conclusion. A funny comedy which was even a more successful Broadway play. Implausible as it is, the great talents of Hope and Ball will undoubtedly please their many admirers. The costumes by Edith Head are above par and the supporting cast is excellent: Jessie Royce-Landis, Jim Backus, Lurene Tuttle, Jerome Cowan, Rip Torn, John Dehner and Richard Deacon."
4,Solid songwriting,Great record. Some beautiful tunes.I read somewhere that they have a new record coming out this year. (*2004?)
3,I have all albums by Hoodoo Gurus...,"Couple of good songs: ""Bittersweet"", ""Death defying"" and ""Hayride to hell"". That's all. I don't like these old sounds. This one is for collectors."
4,Excellent value item,Very nice filming of extreme beauty places on Earth !Good companion for a more colorful living room !In my opinion its a best deal around $5 to $7 value if it is on this price buy instantly.I gave it a 4 star rating because I do not like the mix of cars etc with beautiful natural scenery.Music is ok but a bit repetive.
5,"Moleskin, large squared",I loev these! Best journal/sketchbook/notetaker I've used. Simple but with some features like the elastic and manilla pocket. This thing is gold.
1,"Bad Item, damaged","I bought this DVD, but they are not originals, instead they are manual copies. Mine does not work at all and my return date expired, so in the end, I have paid for nothing. Do not buy the ITEM."
4,Not what I expected but I love anything to do with Despicable Me Minions!,"Nonethless, it is still worth having as I can add to my collection of animated movies! This is all I have to say."
1,Too Short!,"Not much of a movie to set your kid in front of. It's over before it even begins. Don't waste your money on this DVD -- just look up ""minions"" on youtube and you'll find everything there... for free!"
1,not worth it,i shouldnt have bought this because its included in the orginal movie. i should have done more research. thats my fault but im looking forward to the new movie this next year
3,Not as good as All Of Us Can Be Rich.,"This is definitely not nearly as good as their first American release AOUCBR. I was looking forward to getting this and I did, but most of the ""songs"" are not even songs. There are some songs but even then they don't sound so good because after they make the songs they put fuzz over top of them so the actual song might be good but fuzziness drowns it out. There is one really good track, ""Until Everything Explodes"". Her voice sounds real cool. -(But unfortunately it's only 2 and a-half minutes long) The Sh!t that you dig, is pretty good too but like I said, the rest of the songs are either terribly fuzzy or just random bleeps bloops fuzz , (badly) sampled guitar riffs, and just noise. Make sure you really know what's on here before you buy it is my suggestion. Check out All Of Us... by EC8OR if youi want to see their talent."
5,I forget I have them on,"The most lightweight and snug sunglasses I've ever worn. I was never comfortable looking down over my golf ball and swinging while wearing sunglasses, but these Sundogs have changed all that. Not only do they make it easier to pick out the ball against the sky and spot my golf ball in the grass, I look good wearing them too. I am most satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend them."
2,It sounds the same,"This EP is not worth the buy, in my opinion, for three reasons. One, ""Virtual Reality"", an excellent song which shows Rusted Root's full potential, is on the LP ""Remember."" Two, the live versions of ""Send Me On My Way"" and ""Cruel Sun"" sound exactly like the recordings on the LP ""When I Woke."" Three, of all the material they have released, ""Big White Bird"" is probably the worst example of the band's talent. This leaves only the song ""Evil Ways"", a cover of Santana's hit. They do an excellent job on that track (in fact, I like their rendition better than Santana's). So, this album is only for hardcore Rusted Root fans who wish to collect all their released material."
2,Only for Rusted Root fanatics,"This CD isn't worth buying.It is only 28 minutes long. Two tracks are available on the original CD's. I didn't think that Evil Ways was anything special. Big White Bird isn't one of the better Rusted Root tunes. The only thing of interest is the slightly extended version of Cruel Sun (it is 10 minutes).Note that this CD also comes packaged with the special edition of the Rusted Root live VHS tape. It comes in a special box, big enough to fit both the CD and the tape. If you are a Rusted Root fanatic, that is the one to get. But be careful, not all versions of the video tape come with the CD.If you are looking for an introduction to Rusted Root, get When I woke."
3,"enjoyable pictures, but analogy will be lost on most kids","My sons enjoyed the pictures in this book, and were mildly interested in Billy starting school, but they totally didn't get the extended analogy about the lost sparrow working its way back to health and happiness, and Billy getting comfortable with going to school. I would have liked more details actually about school, and how Billy adjusted. However, the cute little detailed pictures of both school and birds were a lot of fun to study! If you have a child that loves birds, this might be a good choice, but I would not look to it for much help in transitioning to school."
3,Probably Best With Pills,"Groovy, yes, danceable, yes, but not the sort of music you need to own. Fans of the Manchester scene may enjoy it for it's nostalgia quality, and fans of trance and trip-hop may enjoy it as a historical curio, but it is not highly recommended. I sold it."
2,Unmemorable,"I bought this for Step On, and now I find even that song to be annoying. The rest of the album is worse. Half-sung, half-whined songs with not much that sticks in your head after it's all over."
4,It's all the rave.,"I got into this album about the same time as ""Stone Roses"" and ""Some Friendly"", and like them all equally. ""Step On"" was the track that got me hooked, but the rest is also catchy, and just as sweet. ""Kinky Afro"" and ""God's Cop"" are a good start, but I think the last half of the album is stronger. ""Dennis And Lois"" and ""Bob's Yer Uncle"" I love, and the last two tracks are a perfect ending to a great party. Alot of this is upbeat and danceable, and what isn't has a good mellow groove to it. ""Pills"" or not, by the end of this album you should find yourself in a state of peace and ""Harmony""."
2,decent skull,"the skull is somewhat useful... i am a medical student and while the skull has most of the important features it was not assembled well, you can tell the different pieces were glued together and some don't fit very well, i actually broke it apart and glued it back together myself to make it fit better, also, many of the important holes, while indicated by small depressions, are not actually holes which can cause confusion.... also BE AWARE the description states that this model contains the vertebrae and artery but IT DOES NOT, it is simply the skull with removable teeth"
1,International Version,"Why is this version called the International Version when it is not available outside the United States? Surely this is a misnomer.Come on Hodder & Stoughton, share the ebook publishing rights with Zondervan."
1,"Bad Reviews, No Sale Here","I read all the reviews about the user UN-friendliness of the Kindle NIV version. Since it is the most popular translation in the world, I would think that this Kindle product would be stellar. Since other buyers have reported you have no idea what book or chapter you are in, and how many clicks it takes to get you to selecting a verse, I will not buy this, and the Bible is the main reason I wanted a Kindle! What's the point of buying the Bible to make you feel better, when trying to navigate it only makes you feel worse? If the most-popular NIV is this bad off, what must I conclude about all the other Kindle Bible translations? Please let me know when all these inadequacies are corrected, and we are able to easily know what book and chapter we are reading. I will order one immediately! thank you."
1,Wow!,Really unfortunate. Every single page worse than the one before. This could make you crazy. How can anyone read this?
5,The good book,How can you say anything against God's word. I truly like the portability of it. Great for when I'mm on vacation or times like waiting at a doctor's office.
5,Holy B,"I just purchased the Bible an hour ago so have not actually used it. After looking at the ""sample"" I am sure I will be pleased. Will enjoy having the scriptures handy even if I don't have my Bible with me."
5,The bible,"what can I say the bible is a great thing to have for your mobile phone, and is very convenient to take to church with you."
3,Bible with me at all times,for me it was too hard to quickly track down texts - maybe was looking for Concordance style. Good to carry around a full bible while travelling
2,"NIV text - Good, Kindle Navigation - Not so Good","After I've tried Bible editions (not NIV) done by another publisher here (OSNOVA), I cannot tolerate the mediocre navigation (hyperlinked TOC, linked chapters, etc.) in other Bibles. Please incorporate OSNOVA's Direct Verse Jump (or something similar) into this NIV. I want to be able to open any verse in a couple of second, and not play with the Kindle Bible as though it were a computer game.Here are the examples of OSNOVA's awesome workKing James Bible (KJV) (best navigation with Direct Verse Jump)World English Bible (WEB) (with Direct Verse Jump)NET Bible First Edition (with notes)"
1,Very Difficult to Navigate,I am very pleased with my new Kindle. I have been disappointed to discover that not all books are keyed to look at footnotes as you read. Attempting to look up a particular verse in the Bible was frustrating at best.
5,Awesome,"Ive tried several Bibles on the Kindle, and this is the easiest to get around in.I'm recommending this to all my friends."
3,Not Red Letter ediction.,I did not even think to check about not being a red letter edition. My fault but I would rather have one.
5,"This book is for all to read, especially the New Testament !",Read a chapter ad day to absorb the true meaning of the Word. Discussion with others in a Bible study is the best.
5,Awesome!,Gods word is truth. This is an easy to read and navigate version of NIV I have been enjoying on my kindle touch.
3,Okay,Not as convenient to pull up different books as others are. I have to go back to the beginning and it slows me down.
2,Needs some Improvement,"Difficult to find way around in the book.. too many keystrokes required to find a desired location, cross referenceing almost impossible"
2,Navigation and labeling pages with book name needed.,"Navigating from one book to another was very difficult...need to have easy access to the table of contents....when I study I like to look up different scriptures not necessarily needing to read the whole book and each page needs to indicate which book of the bible it is...the way it is set up now you have to flip pages to the beginning or end to see where you are if you bookmark.A one touch table of contents of the books would work great to move from book to book easily and a book indication at the top or bottom of the page stating which book, psalms, proverbs, etc"
4,NIV Bible,I'm still navigating through it but all in all I like it. I wish it waseasier to get to a specific page.
5,NIV Bible,I enjoy having the NIV Bible with me in church so I can follow along with the preacher when he reads scripture during the service. I can make notes and save them for when I want to review the scripture.
3,Holy Bible (NIV),Not a very good user interface. Navigating this version of the bible is very frustrating.Wished I had known that before I purchased it.
3,Holy Bible NIV,NIV version of the Bible is great. It's understandable and clear. My problem is not with the Bible but with the trying to look up specific books and verses. I've had to find the book and then page through the pages to get the specific chapter and verse that I'm seeking. This takes a lot of time.
3,extremely useful,"The table of content is broken down by testament, book, and chapter; so jumping around is a lot easier than some types that just list all books and chapters in a list.I'm sure it's more to do with the version of Kindle app I'm using but I wish I could highlight and make notes."
5,Perfect for my needs!,"After careful consideration, I decided on this version of the NIV Bible to obtain on my KF. I had peeked at a couple of the samples, the Archeological Study Bible.. which looked extremely interesting.. and I even downloaded a 'free' Holy Bible as well. My decision to chose this was for two reasons... 1) Is that it's very 'readable'.. In that.. I mean that with the lanugage and words of today. (KJV with Thou and Thee and begat, just makes my head hurt just a tiny bit) 2) I have the NIV Study Bible in hardback and absolutely love it... The Archeological version, though interesting as I mentioned previously, was very hard to navigate on the KF since it loads page for page as it would if in hardback and if you're using the KF to do your Daily Bible Reading as I am, then getting lost in the 'study' areas would make for confusion."
3,Not favorite translation,"I don't think this translation is very attractive. It makes the lines sound more awkward than the King James version, and it doesn't make me feel as touched when I am reading it. The organization and the paper it is printed on were nice though. I will still keep it in my car, as I like to have a copy there."
4,Better than I thought,"I edited my review of this bible because my opinion has changed since I've had it a while. At first, I hated it because of the ultra-thin pages that stuck together and seemed like they'd rip when turning them.Actually, this bible is sturdier than I previously thought. I wouldn't recommend this bible to people who have a hard time reading very small print, though. But it is indeed a good bible to keep on you."
5,Why not available in Europe or Azia?,"I don't understand why I can't buy this Bible. I want a NIV bible, but it's not available when you live outside the U.S. Does somebody now who I could buy this one?"
4,Zondervan NIV Bible,The Bible is fine but it is difficult to find things because you have to go to the Table of Contents each time you want a new passage. I don't know how this could be done any differently but it takes longer to find things than in my regular Bible. that's why I didn't give it five stars.
4,"Like it, I would have loved it in Red letter edition","I do like the NIV,the cover is ok, I would have loved it more if it had been red letter edition,"
2,too hard to navigate,"It's too hard to get to different books/chapters, requires too many steps. It's also too pricey. I can't figure out why it cost $10!"
2,NIV Holy Bible,"I recieved this bible and as much as I love the information inside, I was told that the condition was Very Good.However, its not very fair to list that as very good because the bottom right corner is chewed on with Obvious animal bites and is also written in on behind the cover.How can I give this as a gift in that condition?!!"
2,Don't like the way this new version was pushed out...,"I purchased the older NIV version and had to exchange my Kindle out. Went to download the old version again and could not. The only similar version was this one. Amazon DID refund the old one and gave me a 6 dollar Kindle editions credit....which I could not use to help fund the purchase of this due to it being distributed by Zondervan eBooks.That is why I gave a lower rating than I normally would. I felt it was just wrong how this recent update was handled. I hope I don't have to repurchase this again next year and have to lose ALL my notes and highlights!As for the NIV, it's good. Just beware when dealing with reference texts on the Amazon Kindle."
1,Table of content does not work past Daniel,The title says it all. I am using iPad 2 and can't even go to new testament for 10 dollars I feel could have done better.
1,The most harmful product on the market today,Use of this product will kill brain cells and cause you to do stuff no ordinary person would ever do. Buyer beware!
3,Here's a synopsis of this book,"God made us just like him, stupid and gullible. He set a trap for us with a tree and a sneaky snake. We fell for the trap. He completely shuns us, his children that he supposedly loves so much. He finally decides after between 5-10k years that he'll forgive us by killing his son, but then we owe him big time. Only those that are willing to spend our whole lives begging for forgiveness for some mistake that grandpa and grandma Adam and Eve made get to spend eternity saying how awesome he is. The rest burn in a lake of fire. The End?"
1,Shouldn't this be free???,I'm pretty sure the BIBLE is old enough to be in the public domain. Shouldn't this be FREE??? $9.99??? WTH??
5,NIV,"Try the English Standard Version for an easier interpretation in understanding the Bible; and perhaps, closer to the actual translation."
5,Highly recommend.,Very easy to read and understand. Enjoy havng it available on my Kindle. I would highly recommend this version of the Bibl.
2,How do I find e.g. John 3:16,"I am ""ne w to this bible, I can't seem to find the. verses as I can in other bibles. Words are clear but do not seem to have an easier way to find the chapter and verses. Can't rate it until I can find the verses quickly."
5,God's love letter to man.,The only source for knowing how to live life and practice our faith effectively.It provides all of the answers to life's trials and triumphs.
2,"Great content (of course), Poor Navigation","I was really hoping that the bible navigation was better that what it is. if you are looking for a NIV bible to read a chapter at a time, I think this would be all you need, however, to use this for a study or to look up passages, it misses the mark. The navigation in the context in the ""study or lookup"" use is the only part of this purchase I was a bit disappointed in."
2,It's impossible to navigate.,"OK, yes, it's NIV (wish it were NASB), and it's the whole Bible. BUT you are giving up a lot with this edition:* Chapter numbers: they don't stand out at all. They're the same size as the verses. Good luck finding them.* Searches: want to look up John 3:16? Good luck. You can't search for that phrase. Instead, search for John and scroll through until you find the chapter and verse you're looking for. Count on spending about three minutes to do it.* Jesus' words in red: that means it's lower-contrast 'grey' on this device. Black bold would have been a much more pragmatic choice.* No notes: this isn't a study Bible. It's your basic Bible with no references, essentially.* No maps: again, this is stripped.If you're like me, you need a Bible on your Kindle, and this is the best one to date, but it's a compromise nonetheless."
1,bad,this bible is not complete it only has the new testament. i was looking for the full bible. i was very disapointed and sent it back. i purchased another niv bible. this ad need to specify the complete detail of this bible
1,incomplete version of the bible,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. When I opened the 'bible' to read it, it started with 1 Corinthians. The Old Testament was missing completely, and the New Testament books were not in their usual order. Maybe there was an issue with the download, not with the Bible itself, but I wouldn't recommend this item."
1,words of Christ in light grey on kindle.,Red letter text is almost unreadable on kindle. Why would anybody think thyis was a good idea. I hope a black letter version of the NIV will be puplished for kindle in the future. This one is a waste of money.
2,index,"Index is very hard to bring up!!!!! Bad usage for me, I'm through please accept my entry now ok ok"
3,Holy Bible Kindle NIV,I do not find this ebook easy to use. Too many steps to get from chapter to chapter in a hurry when referencing verse to verse in different books. Would not purchase it again nor reccommend it.
5,Holy Bible NIV,"Excellent, just as I had hoped. Easy to navigate and read. A perfect way to have the Bible with you all the time."
4,NIV Bible,"The NIV Bible is good, but I wish I could get to the exact biblebook and verse more quickly. It would be great if I could just type in the book and verse and quickly move to it."
1,"Cannot search for books, chapter or verse","I have been unable to look up books and chapters. The only way that I have been able to move or search is by page number. If you don't have the books, chapter and verse, it is a little difficult to find the scripture during the sermon. I lost the majority of the sermon trying to look up the scripture. I was forced to use an on-line version on the kIndle and on my iphone when the wifi slowed down."
2,Holy Bible,"I wanted something I could travel with. I go to a lot of conventions where Christians will gather together on Sunday to just stay connected to God's word. This version wasn't my first choice, but it works."
3,A minor criticism,The problem lies with finding a book or chapter in the Bible easily. It is functional but not quick. ?This can be easily remedied.
4,Online Bible,Great for what I needed. I use it for BSF and it is easy to use and better to read with myu Kindle.
2,Not easy to find scriptures quickly.,"I'm dissapointed that it takes so much time to find scriptures. I'm still trying to find short cuts to where I need to be. I hope I can find shortcuts that I haven't found yet. By the time I find them, the scriptures have already been read aloud. Instead of having to scroll to the alphabetical list, I would have liked to have had a touch screen of the books, which would make it much quicker to find the books."
1,Wha??????,"I keep getting confused; it was like there were a bunch of authors instead of one, and they didn't really talk to each other or bother to research their material! In one place it says the main character made women AND men, and in another it says, no wait, it was just a dude that got made and then he took a rib so that there were women, too. Plus it seems like it advocates slavery and rape. And what happened to the unicorns?"
1,Mis-titled,I meant to purchase the original NIV translation and bought this one unaware that it was a revision. It should have been more clearly marked. It was a gift and the recipient was unhappy with it.
4,K3 for Scripture Reading,"I purchased the NIV (Kindle version) last week (from the Big Deal sale) for my K3. We use the NIV in church for the scripture reading and screen projection via MediaShout 3.5. I read Psalm 24 from the podium using my Kindle so I could change the font size for my poor vision. It worked perfectly! However, the Kindle version leaves out the word ""Selah"" from the Psalms while the computer-projected version behind me included it. I didn't feel that was a big deal anyway since some 'experts' teach that Selah was a musical notation that means 'pause.' [...]I found the navigation very easy to use after the initial opening-which was very confusing. Undaunted, I did a 'Go to' to 'Table of Contents' and the navigation changed to normal."
3,"Indexed, but Cannot Search","I've had this Bible on my Kindle DX for several days now, and it is the only book on my Kindle that returns 0 results no matter what word I search for. I'm not talking about the error message that you get before a book has fully indexed. The Kindle can't find anything on this Bible through a search. At this point I am going to try and delete and reload the entire Book. Maybe that will work."
2,Not so great,"The authors should realize that this is a different book given its complex structure. If you are in the New Testament and need to go back to the table of contents the ""go to table of contents"" should take you to the NT table of contents. Same idea about the OT. It takes too long to get to the desired location.Second, the pages should be more like the paper pages. At the top of the page you should see the BOOK and chapter you are currently looking at. The numeric location at the bottom of the screen is useless."
2,Hard to navigate/unsearchable,"I wish I could type in the scripture reference I am looking for and it would pop up, but this format of the NIV Bible doesn't work that way. You have to go all the way back to the Table of Contents and scroll through the long list of books until you find the one you want. Then you have to scroll through the long list of chapters until you find the one you want. For at church or in a Bible study setting, this version is terrible. It would be faster to flip through an actual printed Bible to find the scripture you're looking for. If you are specifically looking for a quick-look-up-type Bible, this is not the one you want."
1,no...,Very difficult to look up a book or verse. Won't open up to the index. You have to start at the preface then flip through pages until you get to the index.
1,nic Bible,"Loved it until someone decided to update it and really messed it up for me. When you update something it should improve not make it worst. I use to be able to get from one book and verses to another in no time at all now I have to get there one page at a time. Bummer. Hate it. What were they thinking! Wish I could go back to the way it was before they messed it up for me. Try going from one book to another one page at a time from John 1:15 to Ps 170:16-20 not good. Hate it hate it hate ittttttt. Now if I get an update notice I delete it.Now I want to ""Go to"" I must go to Frount Matter then to Table of Contents then Old Testament or New Testament Pick the book and then page to page till I get to the chapter and verse that I want. I use to hit ""Go to"" then Old or New testament, pick the book and then pick the chapter that I wanted and I was where I wanted to go. Why did they mess it up?"
1,I could not figure out how to give it no stars,I was searching for a downloadable bible. What I met was a bible that was accessible without an internet connection because it was downloaded onto my tablet!
5,Holy BIble (NIV),This is a good reading Bible. I keep it on my kindle to read when on road trips and for a study reference.
5,Holy Bible,This product arrived on time if not sooner than expected. The product arrived in excellent condition and there is absolutely nothing that I would change.
5,HOLY BIBLE,"Downloaded easily onto Kindle. Since I enlarged font for ease in reading, I can carry entire Bible very easily vs. bulky book."
2,NIV THINLINE BIBLE,"Physical properties of Book excellent.. however the most important problem I have with this selection is not having been made aware in its' online description that the type size/font would be so small!! I have a very bad response to this situation and unfortunately would not recommend purchase of this Bible, given the miniscule type size."
5,NIV Bible (Paperback),This was going to a person that could only receive paperback books. It was just as described and arrived promptly!
3,to hard to navigate,I purchased this item for a Bible study. This particular study has you going throughout the entire Bible. This product is much too hard to navigate from one book or chapter to another.
3,Navigation could be better,"The translation and display are excellent. However, I wish the navigation were easier. Until that is improved, I do not feel that smartphone Bibles will really catch on beyond those who are very technology oriented. I fail to understand why websites like biblegateway.com can take you to exactly where you are seeking by inputting book, chapter, and verse into the search box, but this is beyond the capability of android based Bibles. It would also be nice to search the text based on key words and phrases. These capabilities would get a 5 star review from me."
4,HAPPY OVERALL,"I like having this Bible on my Kindle Fire. I like to use it at church, but it is a little slow to navigate through. Sometimes it takes too long to find a specific scripture because of needing to go back to the table of contents each time. Overall I am happy with this version."
5,The best bible for someone who wants to know more,"Very crisp, simple, easy to read. Words of Jesus are in red."
1,Hard to Navigate,"I ordered this bible because my church uses the NIV but it was very hard or next to impossible to navigate to a specific verse. If you were at church or a bible study, everyone else would be 10 minutes ahead of you by the time you got what you were looking for which defeats the purpose of having the bible on Kindle. I've heard that the ""Kindle Bible"" is very easy to navigate, so I will be trying that."
4,nice to have,"This is a really excellent translation, from reader's point of view. I'm not a linguist. I have this translation in hard copy which is my version of choice, currently. I find the kindle reader on my android a little difficult to use, which is another issue, but since I like to cross-reference it becomes a little inconvenient. But the kindle reader on my PC works well. Having it on my android is really nice."
5,holy bible,great product and works great. i love the product and it is serving my purpose great. would recommend it to anyone.
1,NIV BIble,Very difficult to look up a book or verse. Won't open up to the index. You have to start at the preface then flip through pages until you get to the index.
1,Do not buy,"Those of us who have spent years studying, writing homiletics, and teaching out of the 1984 version of NIV would say this new 2011 issue is not only an impostor, but an abomination. The differences in wording is too frequent and too inaccurate to list here. But there are web sites that detail differences with great detail (for example google ""Robert Slowly 2011 Bible""). To say the least each book of the Bible has been altered. The intent of dialog in Scripture has been tampered with in many places. I work for large Bible study organization that is having to make the mammoth decision whether or not to rewrite finalized versions of their studies that are based on the 1984 NIV because the 1984 NIV is to go out of print, and be no longer available for class members. They reject this new 2011 version on basis of the altered theology because of the new wording in critical places. Find yourself an ESV or a NASB and stay away from any NIV published after 2010."
4,Great Bible but.....,..... I returned it because the font size was just way too small. Swapping it out for the large print version.
1,Can't Navigate,One of the most important things you have to be able to do with your Bible is navigate. I have tried to navigate via the alphabetical option and I end up in the contents section. I try to navigate via the content section and I go around and around and back to the content and never get to the Book I need to read. This is so frustrating that I end up using my regular Bible and of course I have to always take a Bible with me because this version is so unreliable.
1,Died in less than one hour!,"I set up the drive, performed one backup of my files (only 3.5 GB), then shortly after that the software & my computer failed to recognize the drive, and it stopped running less than one hour after I had plugged it in. What an expensive piece of junk! Happily I was able to take it back to the store where I purchased it (not Amazon) for a refund. A good thing, because if I had to send it back to Seagate (who bought Maxtor late last year), they only would have replaced it with a factory rebuilt unit with a 90-day warranty! Stay away from this one. Are there no reliable external hd's out there?"
3,Good drive but AVOID THE BUNDLED DANTZ SOFTWARE,"The drive works great. Plug it in, it works, copy files, have a nice time.It comes bundled with Dantz Retrospect backup software (or at least mine did). Run run RUN AWAY do NOT use that Dantz software! It does not work. It cheerfully claims to be backing up your files, but when your disk crashes - - shazam - - unable to find anything to restore."
3,Not what I expected,"This HD works great, but the problem is that the synch feature is pretty annoying and it over records data over and over...."
2,"Some odd choices, in my opinion","When I go to Silver Lake, it's to see the Kesling houses. They may not be the most architecturally significant homes in Silver Lake but they're interesting enough to have been used in movies and are fantastic examples of ""moderne"" homes which are scarce, even in LA. Not even a mention of them in this guidebook. Obviously, this small volume can't cover everything but it manages to include a dog park, the Mack Sennet stages (historically interesting, but just a box), a Masonic temple that's also a plain box, and several places that are mostly obscured by foliage. So what there is, isn't bad but some of the choices are peculiar, given what's left out. If you can handle a bigger book, any edition of the David Gebhard guides to southern California covers a lot more of this area, and everywhere else in southern California, as well."
4,A Succinct Overview,A concise little book that gives some very useful information about this fascinating section of Los Angeles.
2,Too long and boring,"This book was too long and for no reason. The story line was good but I expected more. The author never really explained why Yanci's husband left and when the subject did come up, it was cut short. Some of these reviews on here give you the wrong idea. I really thought this book was going to be the bomb, but I think it was a waste of money. Get it from the library or borrow from a friend"
2,Don't Believe the Hype!,"I heard so much hype on this book from reviewers and I wanted to read for myself. Unfortunately, I think the reviewers were friends, family and probably the author herself. This book was so elementary-written and predictable. It wasn't nothing short of soap-opera. I was disappointed. I thought it was going to be something different like the great novels, ""PROMISES BEYOND JORDAN,"" or ""LUST OF THE FLESH."" This book, 'ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE,' was very disappointing. The writer needs to learn to balance dialog with narratives. She had too much dialog and not enough narratives."
2,It's ok if you just need something to read.,"I know this book is older and I'm glad I found it at the $1 bookstore. I ended up skipping through quite a few chapters in the middle because it was filled with fluff. There are full pages devoted to a sexual enounter(s)between Yani & Alex. She marries him after this whirlwind, long distance romance, them moves her children to New York. The relatioship between Alex and her children was not developed, but all of a sudden they are calling him Daddy. Yani immediately weakens at the touch of Jarrin who had abandoned his family, broke the law, and is still on the run. What bothered me most was the dialogue between supposedly successful, educated, professional adults. At times the dialogue between Yani & Asia was downright crass. I kept thinking what kind of people talk to each other this way? Anyway I finished it and will maybe try another book by this author."
3,If U like Mills & Boons then you will like this book,I found this book so unrealistic that at times I had to laugh at the absurdity. Don't get me wrong it is an enjoyable read but it is almost like reading a Mills & Boons. If you like Mills & Boons then you will love this book.
5,Love Does Conquer All,"This book had it all. I enjoyed every page. I literally could not but it down. Once Yani and Alex hooked up it was on from there. I laughed, cried even became angry at the actions of these characters. Alex was a dream come true. Yani seemed to have it together until Jarrin came back in the picture and then I thought I was going to loose it. I could not understand her actions. Poor Asia was in for a rude awakening. But in the end love does conquer all. I bought the sequel and can not wait to start reading it tonight. Shonda Cheeks did a good job."
4,Good Read...,"This book started out slow, but picked up well after the first few chapters. Somewhat predictable, but enjoyable to read."
5,Page Turner,"Another Man's Wife was a good read, Read it in a day. A very good read with a few good twists."
5,highly recommend to friends and anyone else,"I received this book and once i picked it up, i could not put it down. There were a couple of twists in the books that made me wonder what was going to happen next and definetly had me going in the book. Its like I was there with each character and you were able to read there lives like true stories. Shonda, you did an excellent job in this book. I can't wait for your next one."
5,Fantastic,"Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!! From start to finish this book keeps you guessing and intrested. You never notice how long the book actually is because you are too caught up in the story. Just FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!! Ms. Cheek really gets you involved in the life of the characters--a love story at it's best. I was sorry to see this book end. Loved every word."
4,Great Reading,This book is definitely a great read. I enjoyed it so much I wish they would make a movie based on it. I do however agree with one reader (the one that gave it 3 stars) when she stated they could gave a little more detail on Jarrin. I also agree that certain parts of the book where sorta unbelievable but yet it was a wonderful read for me. I read this book in 2 days because I just couldn't put it down.
2,Read at your own risk,"Let's just say I bought this book a week ago... I was siked on a page turner as I thought it would be considering the 5stars that the book received. I could definitely feel the story line that ms cheeks was working with but it seemed as though she gave more information where it wasn't necessary and lil' information where it was. For instance, Jarrin... Come on 15 years is a long time to be married, what happened? That's how I finshed the book with questions."
5,Absolutely a Must Read,"This novel is a must read. It's a book about love... a first love... love between a man and a woman ... love between sisters... love between friends... love between a mother and her children... and the love that conquers all. Another Man's Wife is an easy read and is highly recommended. At the very start of the book you are left with a ""need to know"" kind of feeling. Each chapter leaves you anxious, wanting to know what happens next. The characters are real, funny, serious, grounded and stong. That includes the men, might I add. The important men in the book anyway! Can't wait for the next release! The writing is excellent."
3,WHATEVER!!!,"i read the book but i must admit, i skipped through it. I was faithful in the beginning so i could meet the characters, after that it became predictable, i knew they were going to fall in love, just didn't care how, so I moved on to where the drama would be, that is where I enjoyed it the most and remained faithful again...even though i skipped i didn't miss a beat...it still flowed...this is one of those books that you can pick up and read from anywhere and be enthralled with the story line. if you don't have anything else in your library to read...ms shonda did a good job in the entertaining..."
3,NOT ALL THAT !!,"When I first started reading the book it seemed a little slow, the pace did pick up a lot and than I can say I way hooked. But as the story moved along everything just didn't seem real to me. It felt like a was reading a fairy tale. I don't want to tell the story line here, but the part where Jarrin comes back into Yani's so like give me a break type. It didn't seems as if the author put much thought into how she would introduce him back. Overall I wouldn't recommend this book to someone looking for a good read !!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"A REALLY GOOD PAGE TURNER, A GOOD BOOK",WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS BOOK I JUST HAD TO HAVE IT. BUT WHEN I GOT IT. IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO PICK IT UP AND READ IT BUT ONCE I DID PICK IT UP I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. THE AUTHOR GIVES YOU JUST ENOUGH ABOUT A CHARACTER AND THEN GO TO THE NEXT AND SHE PULLS YOU IN LIKE THAT. i CANT WAIT TO READ SOME MORE OF HER WORK.
5,A great Metal Live Album!!!!,"This album is excellent. I have the LP and i can tell you that all the songs are very good. The First Song ""EXCITER"" is a very powerful song, is the best performance of metal. ""RUNNING WILD"" is a mix of power and style. ""SINNER"" is a clasical song of metal (song of 7 minutes) and very full. ""THE RIPPER"" good guitars and sound. ""THE GREEN MANALISHI"" i love the voice of rob halford. ""DIAMONDS AND RUST"" is my favorite song, my tears begin to appear of emotion. ""VICTIM OF CHANGES"" is the way to live the heavy metal!!!. ""GENOCIDE"" jajaj, thank you genocide!. ""TYRANT"" heavy heavy powerful song. This cd must be in the best albums of metal and if you are a rocker you must buy it. Thank you."
5,OFTEN IMITATED NEVER DUPLICATED!,"Being the first of many priest albums I've owned,it covers the early work of this band as well as any live album has ever done.No double live filler BS for this group. If Rob Halford ever rejoins this band definitely a must see concert. Saw these guys on the Heading out to the Highway Tour and couldnt hear anything for a week, Nobody makes you go deaf anymore!"
5,Unleashed in the east,"this is a great album, unfortunately I bought it because the description, which said it was a japanese print, unfortunately it wasnt"
5,"Buy it for the live version of ""Green Manalishi""!","Judas Priest are great. This live disc is great. But if you don't buy the disc then you have to buy the ""Green Manalishi"" download. The live version of ""Green Manalishi"" is one of the greatest rock songs ever and I don't mean one of the greatest live songs ever but one of the greatest rock songs ever!Do not buy the studio version of ""Green Manalishi"", it pales in comparison to the live version."
4,The re-release was worth the wait!,"I found this while looking to a replacement copy of HELLBENT FOR LEATHER, which I had lost a mere fifteen years earlier. That's the funny thing about growing older: somethings never get old. LIke this band. I remember 'out-growing' them for a while, but the sound they created during my teens never left me.This repackaging was orginally my 'stand-in' until i could find a new copy of HELLBENT FOR LEATHER. What I found was a better album than I remembered. The addition of live versions of 'Hellbent for Leather' and 'Delivering the Goods' was a wise choice, as both are phenomenal. The new production is clear and crisp. Gone are the muddy over dubs of the original. In fact, my only complaint is they didn't do a live version of 'Take on the World' for this album. But, that omission aside, I highly recommend this."
5,"So ""bassic"" it makes learning a breeze","I was quite impressed that this book, though indicated as being for dummies, was quite helpful for even smarties. It spells things out in a helpful and non-insulting manner. In addition, it allows you to pick and choose what you want to read about. A great starter book."
4,Bass Guitar for Dummies,"While serving on a military tour of duty in Iraq, I concluded that I'd like to learn to by the bass, when I get back to civilization. The book helped me to forge ahead. It's written for folks that do not have a lot of experience with the bass or music in general. I'd recommend the book to anyone that's in the early stages of learning to play, or to someone who is just thinking of learning. It's a nice motivation book!"
3,Not the best for my first bass book.,"Good thing I have a friend who teaches me. This book, for me, is not the best for beginners."
3,Over the top,Probably too much information for the average user. Not entirely user friendly either. Perhaps there is a less complex book.........
2,Not for Children,"Other reviewers have pointed out the positives about this book, I don't disagree. But, they fail to point out one major hurdle this book ignores.I've been using this book for about a month, without any success.Players with small hands,like teens,ladies and myself, using a long scale bass, will not be able to use any of the play along tabs.The author demands the use of a ""correct"" four fret left hand position, the small handed will not be able to stretch that far.I can only cover 2 of the top frets. somestimes 3, if in a row. Author does not give any clue about what the student in my situation should do until hands are grooved in.I will need to get a live teacher who can adapt the lesson plan to my present hand stretch.Hands will get stronger and limber, but beginners hands are sometimes not strong and limber."
2,Somewhat lacking,"I had higher hopes for this when it first came out. Unfortunately, this book is a mixed bag. Some of the advice on gear and purchasing is very good but the instructional part of the book is lacking. One of the biggest criticisms I have with the book is the use of a fretboard diagram that is rotated 90 degrees. Most diagrams don't have that orientation as a common practice. Additionally, the chapter describing walking bass is very perfunctory. There are maybe two or three pages to explain one of the most important concepts in bass playing. Slap and pop are given even shorter shrift. This is an important/modern bass technique and the author spends a page to describe it! You must be kidding! Save your money and buy the Complete Idiots Guide by David Hodge."
2,"Ok, but could be better","I wanted to like this book but can't. First problem with it is all the wasted pages in the front part and the rear, things like how to buy a bass, stringing it, tuning it, standing, buying an amp. Gee every book you buy repeats this stuff. If you split these pages out you find a core of about 150 useful pages. The second problem is, it lacks how to read notation and get the rtythmn. It needs more examples of counting out the rhythm using words or mnemonics, aka Kodaly, or Winslow Dallin based. Once you get pass the examples of whole, half, quarter notes, these are easy, this info just drops off, i.e. as soon as the notation starts to get tough it quits. I have not counted out the pages but I am guessing only about a 1/3 of this book is meat, those other pages could have been used, filled, with practiced sheet music with mnemonics. If you have some high school band under your belt this missing stuff will not be an issue for you."
2,A Low Note,"Usually I have nothing but praise for the ""For Dummies"" guides. Not this time. I suspect the fatal flaw here centers on the ""Bonus Audio CD!""--conjuring up associations with a prize in a Cracker Jack box. About halfway through the book it dawns why the material is flying over my head.The CD is not incidental to the book. It's essential. ""Bass Guitar"" seems built around the CD. Kick out the CD prop and you'd have no book. I'm afraid the author assumed that a shiny piece of plastic would so dazzle that readers wouldn't notice the indifferent writing. It's a slight-of-hand that simply does not work."
3,Not bad.,"This is a good book but not the best. As a guitarist I have always wanted to play some bass, so I bought the book. I can tell that after two months of hard study, I can play simple tunes and a little bit of rock and roll. This is good for beginners but if you want to get serious in the bass, go out and take lessons with a real teacher."
5,Bass Guitar for Dummies,I play bass therefore I'm a dummy. This book was made for me. does what it says and says what it does. It a bass book for amature-semi pro.
2,This book is too small.,"If only this book and it's companion exercise volume were just a bit bigger. This is not designed to put on a stand and play the itemswithin it! It seemed to be pretty much something to be carefully read studied, and then you go to the bass and play. The print is sosmall and some cases the various pages are not used efficiently. The content is awesome, writing style is easy to understand.If this thing were double it's size, I think it might be the best thing ever. Remember read it study, then go to the bass or find a copierblow each page and then it's ten times more useful."
3,"Wonderful Resource, But Intimidating for True Beginners","I've played bass for a few years. I have a lot of music experience, I also play oboe, clarinet, and piano. This was my first string instrument.The only gripe I have about this book is that it is extremely theory based. It's hard to complain about that but the book is boring and most true beginners who have no musical experience will be intimidated and have a hard time using it. In other words, I don't find it very suitable for true ""dummies"".I'd like to see more straightforward, practical knowledge and less theory. Let's face it, 90% of people picking up this book will just be bass hobbyists and will only use guitar tabs anyway, so I'd really like to see some of the focus taken off of standard notation and musical theory."
2,Difficult to read,"Very disappointed in the size of the Font. To see size, do the followingLoad Notepad, format,font,go to Arial,regular style and then type 5 in size area.Begin typing to see the size the music tabs are written in.If that is not too small by all means get the book."
3,Technical for TRUE Beginner,I bought this expecting something that would allow me to pick up a few things not become a bass teacher but this book is heavy reading and is much to technical for a real beginner. If someone has already learned the basics then they might consider this book.
5,great book,"I just reviewed Hal Leonard's 3-in-1 bass book, which I bought at the same time as this one (a few months ago), and my reaction is basically the complete opposite. I like both books, but now I'm talking about this one.The paragraph/semi-narrative style is great for learning when you're away from your instrument. But you'll probably find yourself wishing you had your bass right next to you to try out something new you learned.I'm a beginner to the bass, but not a beginner to music. Still, I sing and singers (especially sopranos like me) are notoriously lacking in knowledge of music theory. So I love finding out about some of the hows and whys behind the whats. It also has great quick references. Personally, I think that anybody could learn from this book."
4,Bass Guitar for Dummies,Patrick Pfeiffer's book Bass Guitar for Dummies is excellent not only for the novice but the expert as well. Patrick has taken the basic concepts of learning to play the BASS and made them easy to understand. The lessons are self paced and the instructional CD that accompanies the lessons really brings the notes on the page to life. This allows the reader the chance to actually hear and feel the rhythm of the written notes. I am really enjoying this book and learning how to play my BASS.
5,I laughed - I cried - I loved it!,WHY DID I HAVE TO WAIT SO LONG?I would have needed this book years ago when my music career still had a chance.... It is unbelieveable how fast this book takes you from Hillbilly sheep band status to actual credible musician status.Well thank this Kraut for finally doing what should have been done years ago!!!If you want to do anything beyond BASSic you need to get this book!!!!
5,Buy it for the Godzilla suite alone!,"I am ""into"" classical music so I purchased this CD with that interest also in mind, but primarily I picked this one up for the piece titled, ""Symphonic Fantasia No. 1"", which was composed in 1983 and is basically a suite of music taken from thematic ideas Ifukube composed for various Godzilla movies. Anyone who is a fan of Godzilla movies has to pick this up because this piece is awesome! The other works on this disc are very good as well; very driving and reminiscent of music of Stravinsky and Rachmaninov. An excellent disc overall."
4,Good,I've always used this and liked it in addition to the other leisure time products for my hot tub chemicals.
4,Leisure Time 45450 Jet Clean,Leisure time products work very well with my spa and when you can order them at a discount price it is even better.
2,not for me,"I bought this product because it was on sale and I thought I would give it a try ( I normally use ""Spa System Flush"" made by Williams ) . I used half a bottle which is about half of what they recommended. After 25 minutes or so I could see no change in the water and decided to use up some of Spa System Flush I had left over ( about 1/3 bottle ). Within minutes a brown coagulating scum started forming on the surface , which is typical with this product. Did the Leisure Time work ? - I don't know but there was no visible change. Does the Spa Flush work ? For all I know it was just mixing with the spa water I was about to drain but logically some of that was circulating through the pipes and jets so I believe it does do something.I am giving this 2 stars because I only used half the recommended amount so probably not fair to the manufacturer but the bottom line is that I will not be buying this product again and will stick with what I normally use."
4,Helps counting,"Cute puzzle, can really help kids learn how to count.my only complain is that some shapes fit numbers that are not the correct one. Other than this, I like it."
2,Good but get better version,I have the one that has 3 pieces the third 4 spelling. We don't use that yet but I'll save it until he's old enough(added bonus). Also the pieces ONLY fit the correct numbers unlike this one
4,Fun and Educational,"My 2 and half year old loves this. She has picked up on numbers very quickly and we are now trying addition and subtraction. It's a game for them, so it makes it fun."
3,Pretty elementary,"My daughter had just turned 4 when I got this, so she could already do the puzzles with no problem. She played with it a couple of times and then was bored. Doesn't really allow any real progression in skills, but since it was relatively inexpensive I might buy again but for a much younger kid."
5,Cute & Fun Puzzle,"My daughter is only 2, so I pick out two matching pieces and tell her about them while she puts them together. They fit together, stay together, and come apart easily. They are very high quality, so they'll last until she is loud enough to learn the concepts and match them up herself."
3,not as durable,"The cards are thinner than expected. it's already looked worn after 10 mins. you can see the chew marks after 5 seconds in the mouth. other than that, it is a great counting game."
4,What goes together,I purchased this for the Speech Therapy practice I work for and all the therapists use this toy for language treatment.
5,gGeat Safety Treads,Agreat simple effecient product that greatly improves the safety of treads. It is easy to install and adheres very well even as an outdoor wooden stair entrance to a spa. Good clean looking product at a good price.
1,For the benefit of the Karen A. Martin Fund...,There are better methods of contributing to the Karen A. Martin Memorial Fund than purchasing this drivel.
2,Terrible sound.,"This Quadromania set is typical of the many amateur CD issues of old recordings that come out of Europe. The recordings were processed with one goal: to hide the fact that they were originally released on 78s. Any sense of natural dynamics is ruined, and overtones are turned into digital noises as the noise reduction program lops of more and more of the upper octaves when the overall sound lowers in volume. Even using a dynamics processor and a multi-band equalizer I can't undo all the damage that was done. An absolute waste of money."
1,Distorted moralism from a bygone era,"If you want an example of confused, distorted, Puritanical interpretations of the Bible and of human sexuality read this book. I was ""assigned"" this book to read as a teenager. We're talking about a book that declares with many exclamation points that you can go blind from masturbating and gives diagrams and details on how to stimulate a woman (your wife, assuredly) without ever using your hands. Funny, but sad that some viewed this as a practical way of navigating modern sexuality."
1,Bunch of Gimmicks that will make more work for you,"If you have a ""day job"" and own a few rental properties on the side, this book won't help much. It's got some cool ideas for someone that wants to add some pizzazz (read ""work"") to thier property management practices. I have to admit that I even used one or two ideas. But this isn't a reasonable ""how to"" for someone who actually needs help learning how to rent properties. I didn't use any of the forms, either. They are too casual and sometimes flippant - I wanted a more professional and legally sound basis to work from. For a comprhensive guide get ""Landlording: A Handy Manual for Scrupulous Landlords and Landladies Who Do It Themselves."" And don't forget Nolo's ""Every Landlord's Tax Deduction Guide."" This topic needs it's own book. Even ""Landlording"" won't educate you on this topic adequately."
2,unrealistic,"Most of the information and forms in this book is very appropriate if you have hundreds of tenants knocking down your door to rent your buildings. Or perhaps if you have a hundred rental properties and don't mind if some stay vacant until the perfect tenant arrives. As a landlord with a small number of units and a somewhat tight rental market with low interest rates, I found most of the advice and forms in this book pure fantasy. Also as a one time renter if a landlord approached me with most of these forms or addressed me as this book recommends I would have moved on quickly to the next rental."
1,Useless forms,"The forms are useless since when you copy them they contain the page numbers and chapter title from which you obtained them from. You can obtain better ""legal"" forms via softcopy methods(CD-ROM) internet so don't waste your time(trying to doctor the copies) and money on this book.. I will provide you mine for free."
4,Found Handy,This was not the only book I read regarding being a landlord. I have read a few other books because I believe that there is not just one book that will cover everything. I found the material in this book informative.
2,Just a bunch of forms and no written advice,"If you are a seasoned veteran with a number of investment properties, then this book might be useful for adding some forms that might cover you in the event of some circumstance. However, the book is not for the beginner looking to get into investment property. While there are many forms, I would probably guess that they should still be looked at by a legal professional before you use them."
