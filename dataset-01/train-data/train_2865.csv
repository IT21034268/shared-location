2,A poor rewrite of the Atmel AVR Databook,"Save your money. The Atmel AVR Databook will give you just as much detail. This book contains errors relating to the instruction set of the micro. e.g. the LPM instruction is shown to be in the AT90S1200 instruction set. It is not!. I belive Mr Kuhnel should rewrite the book to correct the errors, bring the book up to date and give some detail on how to use the AVR processor in some depth. Overall I was very dissapointed."
4,A good summary and introduction to the popular AVR micros,"The book is a good overview of the AVR. The instructions are explained carefully, so is the hardware. The most important information from the databook are included which gives you all documents you need in one book. However, more updated datasheets are available on the Atmel WEB page . The book does introduce different development tools available. Due to the rapidly increase of AVR tools in the worldwide market the book covers a subset. Worth the money for those who want a quick start."
5,Useful,"The book gives us a lot of tips to help our children practice at home. We want to help them but we don't know how. It takes us, parents, step by step into children's world and shows us exactly how to support them instead of turning them down. Excellent book!"
5,exactly what I was looking for.,My child is a die hard iCarly fan...and the show comes on TV at hours that are not always appropriate....this was a perfect gift...
5,Not just for kids,"iCarly is one of best TV shows ever made, in my opinion.It's one of those programs where the casting, writing, and direction all worked together and the whole series turned out wonderful.Very funny, very good show. I wish they hadn't stopped production of the show."
5,rat fink comics...,"I just have this nice copy of rat fink comix buy big daddy roth & r.k sloane.Fun stories and excellent drawing too,get it and you be a rat fink !!!!!"
5,Great Read,"A great read for Moms of teenage girls. Lisa details the specifics on teens and depression. Even if your daughter is not depressed, this book is handy tool for insight to teen girls and their issues. Positive, easy read, and hopeful... Lots of suggestions on helping teen girls.."
1,My Billy Ray Cyrus Story,"I will always be a Billy Ray fan no matter what Kari said about him! She went into the ""relationship"" with her eyes open and knew he was married. He continuously referred to her as a friend, so she is the one who put a more permanent position in the ""friendship"". As the old adage says, DON'T MIX BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE. These are her words only, so the other side hasn't been heard from yet!"
3,Pretty Pink Sports Watch,"This watch has really useful timer and stopwatch functions that are fairly easy to operate. It is kind of big, though. And the numbers can be hard to read - they blend into the pink face. Still the pink color is really fun and the price is affordable!"
3,"A decent watch, BUT...","Its a pretty watch, looked great online. But when I received it, it was so difficult to read the time. You have to angle your watch against the light just to get a fair reading of the time. Imagine how difficult it is when there isnt adequate lighting. Its cute, sporty, and fashionable but not really practical. Consider another model like the Casio Baby-G Whale series, but all in all, its a pretty decent watch with a decent price."
2,can't see the time!,"Jomashop is a nice company, so far, I haven't started the return part of the deal. My sister has this watch in black and likes it a lot, stop watch, light, 12 or 24 hr time, and classy looking for a watch of this type. I got one in pink, there is not enough contrast on the face to read the time or anything else on it. If you try one, I don't recommend the pastel colors."
2,Pink Baby G,"The display on this watch is very hard to read. The numbers are not black but gray and this makes it difficult to read. Depending on the light you may have to angle it to be able to read the time - not very convenient! The strap is very plastic looking and the whole watch was was much more juvenile looking than I wanted. I decided to return the watch to Mr Watch - be aware that they charge a 10% restocking fee, and then took out additional money to cover the initial shipping despite the fact that I got free shipping. So in other words it's only free shipping if you keep the watch, if you return it you pay to ship it back (which is fine) but they will then charge you for the initial shipping. In fairness it does say this in their return policy if you go looking for it but I've never seen this anywhere before. I called customer service at Mr Watch and they did take care of it and said they were looking to change this policy but it's something to be aware of."
2,Too Small,I bought this item thinking it would be a nice large watch but it was not. I like it but the buttons were smaller then I wanted. Also the whole watch was smaller then I hoped. Now I am on the search for a G-shock that is the correct size.
3,All-Clad 6 quart,"This is a very nicely made pan. The high sides make it easy to cook large dishes without slop-over. I was surprised at how light the pan was for its size.This is my first All-Clad pan, so I was also surprised to find its negative the minute I picked up the pan: All-Clad wins the prize for the least ergonomic handle on any cookware item. Even the empty pan is uncomfortable to hold because of the groove that runs the length of the handle. The top sides of the handle want to dig into your palm or your thumb, depending upon which way you try to grip it. An empty pan is bad enough, but with a pan full of food, you'll need to bring your plates to the stove rather than trying to carry the pan to the counter. The handle looks like a Brancusi sculpture, but it doesn't treat you artfully. This is such an obvious design flaw that its survival is perplexing. Unless the handle is reconfigured, this is my last All-Clad pan."
4,Excellent For Beginners,"My friend came 1 day with this DVD and we practiced 2 sequences from it. It was very clear, because they show you the steps as a couple, then as the leader alone, then the follower alone and then the couple again. It was very easy to learn. I recommend this DVD. Those who gave a bad critic here, have valid points, but you will not get the correct embrace unless you practice, practice, practice. So use this helpful DVD then go to Practica."
5,Lady S. just back from Buenos Aires,"This is an excellent DVD for beginners , very clear instructions , verythorough.I learned a whole routine just from watching this DVD , much better than twoclasses that I took !It also teaches graceful carriage and posture , and elegant fluid lines."
1,Go to the profesionals leave this alone,"I realize I've only been do Argentine Tango for 7 years but have worked with many of the major instructors. This video is odd in so many ways. her Spanish is terrible, even for a Brit. The timing of the steps NEVER follows the beat, the woman does not maintain her own balance, the man has no core or chest lead. If you want the apilado style shown here find Carlos Gavito DVDs, if you want traditional get Fabian Salas, Osvaldo Zotto, ""Mingo"" Pugliese or his wife Esther with their son Pablo (and learn the proper standard sequence of a molinette turn as Mingo defined it). Pablo Veron, Favbian Salas. and Gustavo Naviera are all on tour this year. Find anyone who has had more than two lessons from these maestros and you will far better off than wasting your cash on this DVD."
1,Possibly the worst dance video ever made,"Dancing is all about rhythm. On this video, the nearly inaudible music lacks a definite beat; worse, the timing of the steps as ennuncinated in a monotone by the narrator NEVER follows any particular beat. There is no joy here.The few French subtitles are frequently in error"
2,She's stylish but that's all - avoid this one for better fare elsewhere,"She's stylish, Marie-Claude Martin, but that's about it; that's all I can say on the plus side. It doesn't have the feel of Argentine tango because it seems as though a ballroom dancer has climbed the bandwagon to get her name on to a tango DVD. Avoid it. There is much better fare for beginners in 'Tango Argentino'. Look elsewhere, for example, there is the excellent series (of 20) George Garcia and Christy Cote tango DVDs, which is, perhaps, the definitive English-language course for beginner-to-intermediate/advanced; but the Fabian Salas series for beginners is also extremely high quality fare."
3,Not One of the Better Mabuse Movies,"I am a fan of Dr. Mabuse and have now seen all of the Mabuse movies. Sorry, but this one is not one of the better ones. The print is a bit fuzzy and the story just isn't that good. The concept (the ""device"") is pretty good but the dialog is often stupid or childish. The plot development is not very good and some things of interest are not explained. Definitely one of the weaker entries in the Mabuse legend. Try ""The 1000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse"" or even ""The Return of Dr. Mabuse"" for a much better example of a more modern Mabuse movie."
5,Get past the first chapter it's worth it...,"This is a good book particularly for anyone struggling with issues at school or home. The early part of the book isn't that useful, but once you ""get"" what you're looking for there's a ton of REALLY useful research-based information. I'd highly recommend."
5,I Will Refer to The Mislabeled Child Over and Over Again,"The Eides figured out what was going on with our 2e son and provided practical ideas to help him. Therefore, I knew The Mislabeled Child would be excellent, yet I could hardly put the book down when I read it the first time. I must confess I stayed up most of the night reading it.I've read literally every book I can find concerning intellectual giftedness, dyslexia, dysgraphia, testing, and learning disabilities. I know I will refer to The Mislabeled Child over and over again as it is the best resource I've found.As a school counselor, I've been recommending this book to parents, grandparents, teachers and administrators. The more we understand children, the better-equipped we are to help each one succeed."
2,Did not achieve what it set out to achieve IMO,"I am Occupational Therapist and mother of 4 children. I think the book is a great source of information but I did not learn anything new. And I did not feel like they really achieved what the book set out to achieve which is helping someone find the ""True Sources and Solutions for Children's Learning Challenges""."
2,good chracters unrealistic plot,The book Surviving Antarctica is about five kids that are sent to Antarctica for reality Television. But instead of camera men they put cornea implants into the contestants eyes. There are tons of crevasse's around so the kids have to be careful not to fall into one. Steve is back in the control room and he can talk to the kids by using a micro phone. When Andrew fell into a crevasse Steve told the other kids how to get to him and he told Andrew not to worry because help was on the way.I did not like this book too much. But I would recommend this to people that like adventure books.
1,the most boring book in the world,I gave this book a 1 star because it was horrible because it wasn't funny. This book is about 5 kids trying to survive the Antarctic area. The part that stands out the most to me is when Andrew gets stuck in the crevasse. I like Grace because she is an Eskimo and I like Eskimo's. My opinion did not change after we read the book because I thought it was going to be boring and it was. I would recommend this book to people that love adventure stories in the snow.
3,"Thrilling, suspenceful, and very realistic","This creative book is about a group of young children who had lost their educational toss and are chosen to be characters in this historical survival TV show. Little do they know that this silly game would become reality.I liked this book but it just wasn't my style of reading. Things moved way to slow and it was hard to to get thrilled again when something tragic happened. I think i would still recommend this to anyone, especially the people who like realistic fiction because well it is!!!!! I still enjoyed reading the book!"
3,A good adventure book,Surviving Antarctica was a good book. The book was about kids that are sent to Antarctica and they need to survive there. My favorite kid of the 5 kids was Billy. Billy was my favorite because he is very sly because he brought food on the trip when he wasn't supposed too so instead of him having to eat the gross food he was eating treats. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure books because this whole book is about kids on an adventure.
4,The Book Review,"Surviving Antarctica 2083: Reality TV is about in the future, where everything pretty much revolves around television, unless you get lucky rolling the dice. A group of kids that don't win there toss sign up for a reality TV show and are sent to survive in Antarctica.My favorite part of the book is probobly at the end when the secratary of entertainment gets fired. she was very cruel. Nobody liked her. All she cared about was getting good ratings. People were afraid to speak up against her becuase it was against the law. But when they all got together and grouped up they won.I reccomend this book because it was pretty exciting. It shows an interesting idea of what the future might be like. It is also interesting to see what may go on in the future like alaska being turned into a nuclear waste dump and urban trash wars. All in all I thought Surviving Antarctica was a geat book."
3,okay but not intense,"This book is about 5 kids who go on a t.v. show. The show is about surviving in antartica. There in the future so they learn everything from t.v. In order to go to college they have to role a dice to see if the can go to college. If they get bad role then they usually get a bad career. All of the 5 kids lose there toss so they go on the reality show in antartica. The book gives good images of what the kids have to endure. I thought book the book was going to be intense but, it wasn't. I would recconmmend this book if people like adventurous books."
3,exciting and realistic,Surviving Antarctica was a pretty good book. The book was about five kids that sign up to be on a reality survival show. The kids must make it to the pole with no outside help. The tent and the primus stove. It's just like camping. Pearl was an example of what can happen if you try help survivors . This was a good book and I would recommend this to anybody that likes adventure.
3,Interesting unrealistic book,"This book is about a few kids (Billy, Grace, Robert, Polly and Andrew) that get chosen to go to Antarctica to replicate Scott's expedition. But, everything is set up exactly like Scott's Journey and they get hooked up in the same problems that Scott gets. Then back at the Control Room Steve tries to help them out by talking to them a voice box. He refers to himself as Birdie Bowers, who is one of the members in Scott's expedition. At first the kids don't get along but in the end they become friends and fight their way through all of the troubles that they endure. Some parts of this book is a little unrealistic but every book has to have some parts like that. I would recommend this to people that love page turners and adventure stories."
2,Doesn't like corners,"OK, corners appear to be the issue with the original Navigator but mine has a very bad, incurable case of the corners. I have replaced every moving part over the past year including the turbine kit, gearbox, flappers, shoes, bearings etc and it still gets hung up in corners. I wish there was a remedy but from what I read, there is none. Next pool needs to be round! From what I hear the Navigator Pro moves around better."
4,Works good,"I agree with everyone that basically it needs a ""tune up"" once a year. Stuff wears out. Think about it.. It is working in a chlorine (corrosive) environment just about every day. It is skimming along the bottom of pools with a surface that is fairly abrasive. It is bound to have wear and tear. Mine worked super for about 10 years but finally... even replacing everything it did not work right. I just bought a Navigator Pro and it is zooming around my pool. I love it. I never do much more than brush the walls every few weeks and the seats and steps. It is a bargain and those that expect it never to need maintenance are asking waaay too much."
1,Hayward Horror,"Oh sure, it works fine when you first put it in, but less than 3 months after we bought it, this navigator couldn't navigate out of any corner. And you'd think that any company as big and as old as Hayward could figure out that it's not a good idea to put loose bearings into a moving pool cleaner! Anyone could build it better, and several have! But we had to get this thing fixed twice under warranty, and 4 more times since that, out of warranty. At an average repair bill of over $80 per repair, I think we've bought this thing at least twice over.I won't buy another one, and I wish I'd never bought this one. I'd recommend a Sand Shark instead. At least it has the ability to get out of corners."
1,AWFUL!,I NEVER GOT THE ITEM!! I emailed the seller with no response and I ended up having to buy the item at a book store because I didn't have it on time for the class I needed it for. I have bought a lot of things on amazon and I have never had a problem until this book. HORRIBLE experience- I would suggest buying from another seller.
3,Awsome,This book was good and bad at the same time because it needs to tell more about junior b Jones and that is why I kinda like it.
5,Home Hebrew study,"This book was written in 1953, and is excellent if you want to teach yourself Hebrew, or to use along with a course. The best thing about this book is that the words are given three ways: in Hebrew, transliterated for pronunciation, and translated into English. Therefore you don't have to keep looking in a dictionary - the English is right there under the Hebrew.They give the words and then keep repeating them in different ways until they sink in.Each chapter is about something definite, such as colors, food, etc. If you keep reading through the book, say an hour a day, the Hebrew words become understood without translating them in your head into English."
3,3.5 stars,"If 3 stars indicates ""average"", this album scores ever-so-slightly above that. Reasons to buy the album: (1) first Cornell album to really show off his vulnerable side and (2) the first half of the album. The cons: (1) the songwriting doesn't consistently hit the highs we've come to expect of Cornell and (2) the marked decline of the second half (bar its saving grace, 'You know my name'). Possibly the riskiest move was the cover of Michael Jackson's 'Billie Jean', which I personally don't like. I want to love this album so much but simply can't. I'm not sure what else to say, which sums it up really: generally uninspiring. But who knows? It seems to be getter better with more listens. ""Carry On"" is worth owning if only for picking certain songs for playlists but it really doesn't hold its own as an album. I think Cornell's approach tho is good -- there's only so long someone can pull of the rock-god thing. It just needs a little refining."
5,The work of a more mature artist...,"It's not wise to approach this album hoping to hear a continuation of Soundgarden or even Audioslave. I'll miss both of those of those groups, particularly the latter, since I was in the minority that actually preferred Audioslave over Rage or Soundgarden...Nevertheless, Cornell isn't a kid anymore, and he's obviously interested in doing more with the rest of his career than trying to pen the next ""Black Hole Sun"" or ""Like A Stone.""I get tired of artists ""going solo"" and releasing albums that sound like watered-down versions of their former bands (Serj, anyone?).This album lies miles down the road from anything Cornell has done in the past. That's a good thing, just go in with an open mind."
3,"Good tunes, VERY poor mastering","If the recording industry is wondering why they lost music lovers, take a listen to the poor sound quality of this album (and many other rock releases of the past 5 years). It's mastered so HOT that digital distortion is everywhere. The kick drums sound like electronic farts. Completely unlistenable, with no space between instruments. I'm very hesitant to buy new albums these days because of this problem. Horrible and sad."
2,Carry On? It just ain't Happening!,"Sadly, this is not up to Chris Cornell's previous work. As an album it lacks drama a fluidity. ""You Know My Name"" from CASINO ROYALE is pretty good but it sounded much better in the movie. I was disappointed."
1,Don't Bother...,"Really... don't bother buying this. I LOVE Chris Cornell, but he must be trying to get out of his record contract or something. After so many good albums, he really had nothing to give here. The songwriting is awful and his singing uninspired (I'd be uninspired singing those lyrics, too). The worst part? He jumped the shark with ""Bille Jean."" What would cause him to cover a Michael Jackson song? No telling. Maybe too much absinthe while sitting in his Parisian bistro. Where is the real Chris Cornell and when will he be recording a REAL ALBUM?!! Maybe a Soundgarden reunion would cure him..."
3,Will Always be a fan...........but a bit disappointed,"I'm a huge all around Chris Cornell fan..own about everything he's done and LOVE IT! The mere fact his voice is on this album is enough to guarentee I'll like it.....don't love it. It doesn't compare to his first solo album Euphoria Morning. Find it a bit boring and with cheesy lerics. After 3 listens to the entire album, it's just not grabbing me like it usually does. I just hope I don't have to wait 8 years for his next solo album.....I still have faith."
1,Not good...,Cornell is a great singer but this music sucks...please Chris get back with Soundgarden or Audioslave!
1,There is a reason!,"He is going back to Soundgarden. This is a terrible album. The Billy Jean cover...laughable. He modeled, now this...the ultimate sell out notion...hopefully he hasn't ruined his career."
1,What Is This Garbage?!?!?!,"Liked him in Audioslave....loved him in Soundgarden....this...is pure, unlistenable trash. I'm all done with this guy."
3,It grows on you,"When I first heard this album, I nearly threw it out my car window for being so terrible. I remember swearing to never buy another Chris Cornell solo album again.Well, I gave it another chance........I listened to it about 10 times, and I get it. It's actually very good. It grew on me, big time. If you listen closely, there are a few segments in a few songs that sounded like what Soundgarden would be like if they were still a band.Get it and give it a chance. Forcefeed it on yourself by listening to it straight through a bunch of times. You'll like it. If you give it one listen, skipping through songs trying to find some instant magic, then you'll be disappointed."
2,dissappointing,"Cornell is an incredible vocalist, but this album is a let down. He needs soundgarden."
5,What I expected,What I expected. You can't have the same album every time. It is a little different but it's solid. I can tell his first solo record is better but so what. This album is still good at first listen. I really wish Soundgarden would make another album but that probably won't happen because the drummer has been in Pearl Jam for over eight years now.
3,It's OK,"Chris Cornell has one of the best rock voices EVER. Unfortunately, it is being used on slow, boring songs. Billie Jean is creative & interesting and there are a couple of good hooks throughout, but overall I can't listen to this without falling asleep. Needs more variety...needs more rock."
4,great stuff,"i thought this was a great album, all the songs r goodthe billy jean cover was my favorite,the only disapointment was he didnt play it at the TLA in Philly when i seen him live"
2,Disappointing,"I love Cornell's work, but this CD was a BIG disappointment. He has much more talent than is portrayed in this release. And it's not that he can't put out a solo CD, as I've worn out my copy of Euphoria Morning! Hope he rebounds."
2,Why?,"Maybe you can blame Steve Lillywhite, producer of U2 and the Dave Matthews Band among others. Maybe you can blame the session musicians. Maybe you can attribute it to Cornell's desire for experimentation.Whichever road you take, they all lead to disappointment. ""Carry On"" fails to come close to any of Cornell's previous work. Vocals, writing, and arrangements all take a drastic step into mediocrity.While some tracks show promise (Arms Around Your Love, Safe And Sound, Scar On The Sky) the crushing disasters in the middle (She'll Never Be Your Man, Ghosts, Killing Birds) are too much to overcome.I still consider myself a Cornell fan, but this one is a miss among many great accomplishments."
2,Lounge Act?,"This is what Cornell broke up Audioslave for?. Sure they never quite matched,but at least it rocked, this sounds like a Lounge Act in Las Vegas, Chris, you can do much better than this!. You are too young to try and like Rod Stewart."
1,"Album's a joke, but not funny",The epitome of the proverbial joke that's not funny. A steaming cesspool of self-absorbed sewage. The absolute pits.
2,Kind of disappointing,"Freed from Audioslavery, Chris Cornell was able to create his 2nd solo CD, and the results are definitely a letdown for me. He seems to be going for more of a diverse singer-songwriter approach, but the song material is decidedly mediocre. Cornell's excellent vocal talent is placed in service of some songs that could easily be sung by Sheryl Crow, or Rod Stewart, Bryan Adams, people like that. As I listened to the album, each song arrived dead, one after another. I kept hoping and waiting for something inspiring and exciting, but instead what popped out was just another dud. The cover version of Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean"" was mildly interesting but only as a curiosity, not as a memorable piece of music. Then I hoped that perhaps the album would ""grown on me,"" but the 2nd time through Carry On was even more boring than the the first. It sure does seem like a might long way down from ""Black Hole Sun"" to this!"
3,Ego maniac or misunderstood?,"The first time I heard the album I was laying down for a nap and I'll tell you, I hated it. So much of it seemed like just excuses for Cornell to let out some nice bellowing. However don't let your first impressions get to you too much. There are some very solid songs here. The 3 that I think Cornell fans should download are: Arms Around Your Love, Disappearing Act, You Know My Name. Give these a listen"
2,too mellow/bring on soundgarden,"Chris is a great singer that seems lost on most songs. I give A+ to ""No such thing "" & ""you know my name"", a (B) to ""Poison eyes"" & ""Your soul today"". However, the other TEN songs are way too melow & lack drive & direction. I know this if this was a Soundgarden record it would have rocked way more. WTF, Black hole sun was the big melow song on Superunknown!! How can he justify 10 freakin ballads! [...]! Call the old buds from soundgarden."
3,Its different,"Don't buy this cd expecting the normal temple of the dogs, sound garden or audio slave style of chris. He has taken a new direction, and although i am sure the music is well written and the lyrics are par, its not my kind of music. There is about three good songs and the rest I could push the skip button for. He does a cover of Billy Jean that I just didn't enjoy although live was much better. If your hard core chris fan, you'll probably want this cd but otherwise I would just burn it from your friend."
2,The wrong way to carry on,"Chris cornell is now a happy man, but his fans are far from feeling the same. his first solo album was a great rock album. the songs were touching, and the production was original and interesting. but 'carry on' is a combination of b songs and cheezy production. the only good song in the album is #3, but still far from each and every song in his debut solo.DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!! stay in the past and remember chris as he was and not as he is!!!"
4,Great cd,"Im a huge Chris Cornell fan anyway. I love(d) Soundgarden, I thought Audioslave were great...I pretty much love anything he's ever done.I have activly seen him live over the past 5 years and was really excited for this record to come out.It met my expectations. It is a really good record. I think ""Arms Around Your Love"" is one of the best songs he has written.It's a little different then stuff he has done, but there are many familiar elements in his song structure from his days in Soundgarden...etc.I'm looking forward for the next record."
1,when you know there is talent you have to be tougher,"This album needs the big push from marketing becuase I couldn't even get through it. I expected so much more. I heard some great knew stuff called project A? None of it here. Chris Cornell is among my top three favorite, if not my favorite vocalist in the genre, he had to be meeting a deadline or maybe he needs some angst...boring album. I'll just plug on the fourth of july and listen to the classics. Soundgarden was classic. I'm so bummed out this wasn't better."
2,This is Chris Cornell?,"I've loved all of Chris's work from Soundgarden to Audioslave. Not only was the music outstanding, but the lyrics were often thoughtful (especially with Audioslave) commentaries on current issues.I just don't get this effort. It's so weak compared to his past work that I think Chris might really need a good band behind him.I understand that musicians often want to go in different directions and support that. For instance, Robert Plant has created albums that are outstanding but totally different from his work in Led Zeppelin. However, this direction is just bad. The songs are droning anonymous creations that sound like something thrown together in a few days time. It was terribly hard to listen to the whole album.I hope Chris does better in the future. This album is beneath his abilities. Here's hoping for a better effort going forward."
1,Huge Disappointment,Let me start by saying I think Chris is one of the best rock singers alive. But this new work of his is a major disappointment. He had such a good thing going with Audioslave....but just like Soundgarden before that he is never satisfied with what he has. THe problem is that his material as a solo artist is just not very good.
5,Let me visit your arms,"What a great singer and songwriter. I'm so glad he's still making albums after Soundgarden. My favs are Poison Eye, Your Soul Today, Finally Forever, and Disappearing Act."
4,People need to listen to this more than once,"I have been a fan of his for 15+ years. At first I was disappointed, but now that I have listened to it like 5 or 6 times, the songs have grown on me. His music has evolved and are now showcasing his beautiful voice. Billie Jean is awesome, you cannot even believe that it's the same song. She's Never Gonna Be Your Man is great."
1,This album is a massive flop,"The first and the last songs rocked, but I could give the rest of this album a miss. I'll proababally give his next album a listen before I buy. Overall the whole album was a huge step down from Audioslave."
4,The more you listen to it the more you'll like it,"The first time I listened I was disappointed. I love his lower vocals on the more bluesy songs, Billie Jean has this. I found the more I listened the better I liked it. Even found myself humming the tunes later. Safe and Sound is my favorite.If you listen to Audioslave and progress on you get it.Even rockers mellow as they get older."
4,A Little Different,"A slower, smoother rendition - no big rock songs but nice for easy listening. After all, it is Cornell's voice that makes it. ""Billy Jean"" is really unusual."
4,Took Some Time To Like,"At first I thought this was an abomination,only 3 to 4 songs that were good,the rest were bad.But after more than 3 years this album is not that bad.Still isn't better than Euphoria Morning but an OK album by Cornell."
4,500 Louvre Masterpieces,"This is an extremly good book for people who want to know the history of the various artworks contained in the Louvre. I had a very limited time to go through the museum, but with this book I managed to see everything! The only reason I don't give it a 5 star rating is because there is no history of the museum included. I had to buy a whole seperate book for that."
2,they seem to have a different sizing system,"All my shoes are in size 7.5, and I wear them very comfortably.But this shoes were very narrow and very tight. Although the label said 7.5M, it was not 7.5M in fitting for sure."
2,Cryptid Hunters,"Cryptid Hunters, by Roland Smith, is a fairly boring book. Marty and Grace are two of the main characters, whom one day find their parents died. They have to go live with their distant uncle whom they've never met. He turns out to be a cryptozoologist who is hunting a dinosaur (Mokele'le'-mbembe), and is preparing to go on a daring mission the twins were not supposed to go on .Their uncle soon found they were not about to be left behind. We gave the book 2 stars out of 5 `cause it was boring, until pg.235 and there is 348 pages in this boring book."
5,- a really good book,"Grace and Marty are at a boarding school when they find out that there parents are dead. They are then forced to go live with there uncle Travis that they didn't even know existed. Uncle Travis lives on an island and he is big into crypto zoology.On a trip to find the last living dinosaur on earth, they run into big problems. They have to fight to survive out in the middle of the jungle. Throughout there journey, Grace and Marty reveal some long hidden secrets about there Uncle Travis. Brave and daring, they end up leaving the jungle safely, with the bad guys left behind.I really liked this book because it keeps you reading. You get to some good parts in the book and you don't want to stop. This would be a great book to come out with a sequel. Another reason I really like this book is because I really like adventure books, and this book is full of adventure."

2,Mastering It!: Spanish by Standard Deviants,"I am very disappointed with the audio discs of this program. The volume is very poor; even after turning my player to full volume one can barely hear what is being said on the discs. For this reason, I am giving this product a poor rating."
5,Wonderful,"I gave this to my mother for Mother's Day and she loves this set as much as she does ""As Time Goes By"". She has watched it several times and loves it even more each time."
5,Charming Judi Dench in A Fine Romance,"Dame Judi Dench and real life husband Michael Williams are a perfect, if unlikely couple in this fun BBC comedy. Straight laced Laura tries to ignore the possiblility of a relationship with landscaper Mike, but it develops despite her best efforts. Dench is a great, dry comedian and Williams is endearing as the sweet fellow who hangs in there with the edgier Laura."
5,Good British Comedy,I love this. Judi Dench is wonderful and Michael Williams that is in this with her is just great. How could he be anything else after all he was her husband in real life. I love the english humor.
2,TOTALLY DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER,After 2 faulty deliveries with only 2 of 6 disks operable I am totally dissatisfied with Amazon service and delays in responding to my complaints.
2,"Not Really ""As Time Goes By"" - Beware as this is dated","I purchased this and was not happy. This show was most certainly influential for the better and latter show, but by no means has the depth and excellent dialogue of ""As Time Goes By""."
3,somewhat disappointed,"Expected much more from the leads. Could not understand them much of the time. The other characters were muchbetter,even the minor ones. Writing was very good."
1,Awful Theater,"Tums Antacid/Calcium Supplement, Maximum Strength, Assorted Fruit, Tablets, Value Size 160 tablets (Pack of 2)This is a terrible depressing series. It is not a comedy or a farce it is a pathetic attempt to keep 4th tier writers employed! If you watch it long enough you may want to not watch anything at all! It has two speeds, stop and reverse. I like Judy Dench but this really is terrible. Get the ipecac! PBS must have gotten quite a deal on this (free maybe) because they keep showing it in Sacramento... A root canal sans drugs, would be more entertaining and less painful.As I look at most all the other reviews of this sad show I think to myself, ""Did these people watch the same show as me? No way!Ok, now I'm really done."
5,"Do you love ""As Time Goes By""?","Then you MUST buy this complete series. It is different, but wonderful. Dame Judi and Bob Larbey (the author of both this and ""As Time Goes By"") shine. Judi Dench plays opposite her now deceased husband, Michael Williams, and they are a real treat. Playing a middle-aged couple who miss as often as they click, they show, through real acting skills, what this crazy thing called love is.I bought this, not having heard a word, or seen a bit. Because I so enjoyed ""As Time Goes By"". I sat down with my mom and we laughed and cried and just loved it.DO NOT hestitate-for this cannot be available much longer-it is over 20 years old. Just go for it...you won't be sorry."
5,Anglophile loves Judi Dench.,She really brings a character to life. And this short series of British comedy was really enjoyable.
5,a fine romance,loved it true british comedy if you loved the british shows of yester year this one is a delight to have in you collection
5,As Time Goes By fans will not be disappointed!,"Dame Judi Dench (Laura) and her real-life husband, the late Michael Williams (Mike) give a performance that will make you as nervous for their characters as their characters appear to be. If you're an As Time Goes By fan, then it will remind you of the misunderstandings Jean and Lionel went through in the seasons prior to their marriage. However, in ""A Fine Romance"", I would have to say there are even more misunderstandings and difficulties, usually created by Laura, and one of her more common solutions is to lock herself in the closet. Yes, a bit juvenile for a 40-something year old linguist, but that's just part of her charm."
5,"Awesome , The Best Stuff Ever & Smells so Good","I use regular Dr.Bronner Soaps for dishes and shower and bought this one to clean my pigs plastic outdoor pool, other outdoor furniture and the bathroom and kitchen. It works like a dream. This product has a nice clean ""real"" pine smell, it smells so good, like CLEAN and FRESH. I love it so much. This one cost a little more than the other Bronner's but sooo worth it. It last forever too, because you only use a little bit and it soaps up and cleans with so much power, better than any of those harmfull perfumey spray things you get on the market today. This cleans mold, mildew and your lani or patio concrete as well as bleach. Treat yourself once and you will find not only is it nice to smell and safe for your pets, but it even last longer is more value for your dollar."
4,a deeper look at Web usage,"If you are reading this on the Web, then you are using a browser. The latter and the Web was one of the sea changes of the 90s. So easy to use a browser. But this book takes a closer look at the Web and Internet usage. It explains that a search engine can have many limitations. In no small part because it usually has no idea what your interests are. So when you send a query to it, there is a paucity of context.There are also surprising usage results. When the Web first came about, it was feared that many users might feel lost when browsing. But in practice, few call this a problem. And those that do are not overly concerned. What was unvariably complained about was the speed of response. The author ties this back to the biological restrictions of human working memory, which demands a subsecond response, for the brain to optimally process information.The book also leads into the Semantic Web. It describes how ontologies might be built up, and the difficulties in doing this."
4,cream-like hard rock from ex-HENDRIX:N.Redding,"A lost"" truly great hard rock trio.The guitar wk.is excellent*(He being Ex-RARE EARTH)This CD IS NOW BACK IN PRINT*(2011)An exceptional lost gem of the 70's.Think CREAM meets MOUNTAIN.It's not a ""masterpiece"",But-is well worth the$$.I believe the record co.went out of business shortly after its release,otherwise ,this would've been a viable vehicle for Redding etal.It's what Fat Mattres should have been.Special note:Redding also actually joined Mountain itself-for s hort while.He's on a couple of tracks from their box set ;which are superb!!!"
3,Fun floating toy,The smily face inflatable toy got plenty of use this summer from kids in our pool. It is quite durable. It did develop a hole but I believe a summer storm is responsible for the hole.
2,Great float at a great price.,I am updating my original review to say that two months after purchase the float popped. Maybe too many kids had piled on I don't know. Or it could have been inflated too much. Whatever the reason it didn't last. Only kids played on it and they were all pretty small. Wouldn't recommend this float and I definitely wouldn't want a lot of adults on it.This float is great. The kids love it. They sit on there like it is an island and the adults pretend they are sharks and grab their feet through the eye-holes. It fits 4-5 young kids very comfortably and 3-4 teenagers. It would also be a great lounging float if one of the parents could ship the kids out for the day! Great buy and great price.
4,"Great for kids feeding themselves in ""big kid"" chair","We have been using this bib for more than a year.Pros:1. Extra length helps even protect lap/pants2. Easy for my son to put on by himselfCons:1. The white trim stains easily. Ours has turned an unsightly brown in some areas.*If you are getting this for extra protection during mealtime, I would recommend the sleeved Bumkins bib instead. At my house I seem to be scrubbing stains out of sleeves/elbows more than pants after meals, and the pocket of the long-sleeved bib catches a lot before it hits the pants."
5,Mesmerizing art,"Andrej Dugin and his wife Olga are painters par excellence. There are many enchanting and truly beautiful books like this on the market, but art of Dugin couple is in their own league, it is poetic, enchanting and imaginative.Being painter as well, I am not so easily impressed, but these illustrations are second to none. Dugins are apparently influenced by the art of 15 century masters, but it has its own distinct and idiosyncratic charm. In short, wholeheartly recommended for all fans of great art."
4,great for 6 year olds,"My son loves the silly/strange pictures throughout this book! I was a little disappointed that the girls father is tricked in the end, could have been a little kinder to him!"
2,A rare Moseley flick,"I'll be honest, this movie sucks. It goes for a Mad Max kind of feel but is poorly executed and takes far too long to go nowhere. All that said, I'm glad I bought this movie and would have paid a lot more for it if I had to because it features an early role by the great Bill Moseley. Most peaple know Moseley as Otis Driftwood from the Rob Zombie films House of 1000 corpses and The devils rejects, but being a horror nut I know him from many roles including Leatherfaces big brother Chop-top in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. He has become one of my favourite actors which is why I tracked down Osa (which was only available on VHS for a very ling time). So if you're like me and like to chronicle films worst moments along with it's best, Osa is a good buy, and I'd be quick too because I think it's been discontinued by the manufacturer."
4,Good Information on TCM for most Dermatology Issues,"If you are having trouble with a skin disorder and think TCM can help then this is a valuable reference guide. Although, I am not a practioner of chinese medicine, this book is short and concise. It lists the conditions and how TCM would treat them."
4,African Hunt,A story of a glorious 7 month safari in east Africa 1927. Something that will be very difficult to attempt or emulate today. Carl Trichardt one of the professional hunters of this book was a veteran of 5 wars and was decorated with the Military Cross For Bravery in World War I. Very well written and easy to read. The book also gives a little insight into some of the East African tribes and interesting information on some of the wild animals. For the hunter and adventure reader alike I recommend this book.
5,Salmon smokers' bible,Best written and illustrated guide we have encountered. We give it to friends who are just getting into fish smoking. My husband follows the recipes for canning and smoking.Family and friends enjoy the results.
2,boring,"This performance is too slow. I had difficulties to catch up with polyphonic lines and to feel the rhythm of the pieces. It sounds like a slow, boring mess. Newer ensembles like Oxford Camerata, The Clerks Group and Tonus Peregrinus are much better with this kind of music. I wonder if they (Schola Cantorum) performed contemporary music in a similar fashion."
2,Not as big as advertised.,"The description claims this is 6 feet in diameter. I am six feet tall and when I lay on it both my feet and head hang over. I suspect this is 5 to 5.3 feet at best. Also the material feel rather flimsy, I worry that this will rip real soon after using it a few times.Disappointed."
4,Sun Tan? No. Kid's Toy? Yes.,"I never got this for a ""double sided"" sun tanner (obvious scam, there). However, I did think it would make a durable and large lake toy for two older children on a lake-stay vacation this summer and it did very well. We were disappointed in a lot of other inflatables we took, but this was one of the ones that really stuck it out despite tough play.Because of the 100+ heat (in Louisiana) we had to touch up the sections once or twice for slight deflation under the pressure of the sun and the kids bouncing on it, but it still held up after 7 days of rough play and is deflated and stored for next year.The only complaint I would put out there is that it's a mother to try to get on and off of if you don't have a high vantage point to jump onto it from. If you're out there in the water and trying to climb on top of it from the sides? Forget it."
4,This a perfect size ! Big !,Love this - I bought two . Sometimes though I flip it over to the silver side as the yellow side can be a bit more slippery to get onto . Not a big deal I guess I just prefer it upside down . It is very sturdy .And so relaxing to float around on as you are not hanging off or falling into a hole ( all solid ) . I would think you could lay in on the grass too .
3,It's my family history,"The story has great family significance to me. I am a decendent of Shang-Yu. The movie is full of action and violence, and follows what I think is the classic story of this period of political uncertainty after the death of the Chin Emperor. However modern the CGI and animation, the pace of the story is at the classic story pace. The movie is very long and the acting and direction geared toward melodrama and action. I would have appreciated some insight into the Chinese psyche of the period or some historical facts that are accompanied by all the massive archeological work going on in China. I wonder is China's real history is still seen as manufactured product for political purposes."
2,White Vengeance,"I had some huge expectations before watching this film hoping that it wouldn't be another kung-fu movie with some distorted historical twists. It turns out to be exactly what I fear: another smaltzy melodrama with all of historical inaccuracies. The plot is pretentious and acting is self conscious. Can Chinese movie makers in general or screenwriters in particular try to learn a thing or two from some of Hollywood's better historical eipcs such as Elizabeth or even lesser movies such as Brave Heart. We as the audience can tolerate certain historical inaccuracies for dramatic impacts. But this movie probably has 15 % history and 85 % padding of melodrama. But on the other hand, you might enjoy it if you are not familiarized with the history of Chu-Han struggles. It is just a passable kung-fu movie with corny dialogues and over the top, but unnatural acting."
1,Dumb country!,"Rarely do I see a movie SOOOOOO Bad I must warn my fellow movie lovers.Do not waste your time, money, or brain on this one."
3,Very good movie,"If you like Twilight Zone type stuff, then this is very well done. It has a surreal quality to it that totally works for the material."
3,Predictable but worth a watch...,"Though predictable, ""Dark Country"" is well cast and edited for a paced thriller for novice chiller fans. Like other reviewers, it reminded me of a full-length ""Twilight Zone"" episode...the zone being the darkness of the Mojave desert...roads that lead everywhere but somewhere...and twist your neck ""what's up?"". I thought Dick (Thomas Jane) and Gina (Lauren German) were convincing and well-cast in their role as newlyweds from Las Vegas. The plot and storyline could have been much more in depth and profound, but as I said, a novice thriller fam will enjoy this very much. 3 stars."
5,Great!,"I just played ASB 2005 for 3 days, and i'm already hooked! I borrowed it from a friend and 3 days later i wanted to own it. The franchise mode is awesome. The hitting starts off kind of hard because you hit a lot of weak pop ups, but once you get to play it you get more and more hits. The pitching is awesome but you throw some wild pitches that really should be strikes. The Create-A-Player is awesome. You have so many options, and you can make your guy as good as you want (from A+ to D-). This is by far the best baseball game i have ever played."
4,ASB05 Rules!,This Game Rules!!! Its quite possibly the best baseball game out there. Buy this game and you'll be able 2 play a awesome season mode
1,Worst Baseball game this season!!!!,"I recently purchased ASB 2005 and i hated it. But lets start with the good things. ( There are only 4) 1.Unique and awsome spring training mode. 2.Beautiful ballparks. 3.the players will stay dirty even after a slide onto second, in the first inning. And 4.The croud look good (probly better then the players)Now there are a lot of baseball games out there and most of them are a lot better then ASB 2004. with ASB some of the lower points are 1.A terrible picher/batter system 2.Almost every pitch has the same velocity and movement as a knuckleball 3.The new ""feilder cam"" where the camera is put on the shoulder of the feilder on defence just doesent work and its way to hard to track the ball. And 4.Replays are verry limited to control.In the end All-Star Baseball 2004 is either underfunded, created by 3yr olds, or a game for the Nintendo 64."
4,Not to Shabby!,"I have to say I like the game. The gameplay is realistic and the graphics are great. I would like to see the hitting changed a bit. It's so hard with the cursor and to easy with the timing on. The fielders cam is cool but far to confusing to play as for to long. As for Barry Bonds, during the offseason he opted out of the MLBPA which is why he is not in this game. Mailman of the Giants is the ""Bonds"" type replacement."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,do not play this game its sucks medium is too hard and easy is WAY too easy. Fielding is impossible because the player will not automatically catch the ball if they are standing in the catching area. Too many doubles by the computer. The computer will NEVER swing at any balls.
4,get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this is exellent i love the game i played it for 3 straight hours!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 dan't find a better game than this one
3,"some great songs, some not-so-great songs, bogs down","I love Desmond Dekker, but there is too much filler on this CD. The album starts off great, then bogs down with some nondescript slow songs with no feel. There are better comps out there (read Sean's other reviews)."
3,Caveat emptor,"This is an awkward ""musicals"" collection as previous reviewers have noted, but the inclusion of 1989's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, not 2004's version of the Lloyd Webber musical, is downright misleading. The 1989 one in this set is a horror film with Robert Englund (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET), made to capitalize on the musical's success in London and Broadway theatres, and the Leroux story's public domain status."
5,Musicals 10 Pack,"Musicals 10 PackI like old movies and this has been a joy to watch. Everyone should get a copy.Thanks,Dana"
3,hard to tell the disks apart,The box is okay but some of the disks are two sided and it is hard to read the very small print in the middle of the disk.But for all that the movies have been remastered as best as they can be as some of them are 60 years old? or more.All in all a good box set with some hard to find musicals in it.
1,"Wow, what a terrible collection.","Had I not received this set as a gift I certainly wouldn't be inclinced to purchase it. With everything that MGM has produced it is totally amazing the poor representation of that work collected here. ""A Chorus Line"" is (was) a totally wonderful experience in the theatre and a complete disaster as a movie and the same is true for ""Phantom of the Opera"". And who, in their right mind, would include the Sandra Bernhard movie in any collection let alone one for supposedly great musicals? Review the titles offered in this set and see if you can't purchase individual copies of the ones that you really want to own for less - if not then buy the set and donate the less important titles to the Goodwill."
1,MGM Musical movie collection,"With all the Musical movie not yet on DVD, They release the same old trash.Why not ""Athena""""The Merry Widow"", ""RoseMarie""and Mario Lanza films ""The Student Prince""""The Great Caruso""etc. ?Very FunnyJFournier777@Yahoo.com"
1,Car Install Kit,"Considering this was the cheapest price for this item, it still was overpriced. One of the lights on the back was broke when it arrived. I didn't feel like soldering it back on. All the edges were rough. Taking the original heater parts out and snapping them in place required some effort and I don't think they fit in quite right. The color was slightly off so the heater controls didn't match. The heater buttons were not solid. When you push the AC button, the button next to it would also be pressed changing the recirc mode. It worked the same when you pushed the defrost button, recirc mode changed. Pressing the left side on recirc button would turn on/off the AC and pressing the right side of recirc button would turn on/off defrost. I would have returned this item if there was other options and I wasn't desperate to get a working stereo to trade the car."
3,your only option,this is the only product that allows you to have an aftermarket stereo in your mazda 6. quick easy instillation with detailed instructions.works as it should but the buttons are hard and hardly move. when trying to turn on the hazard light or the ac you have to mush and mash to get them to work.i have also found that i cant get a corner to sti flush but i can't see light around the edges at nightso its not the worst situation but i expected better for the money.oh ive hav this for 3 years now and it still looks and works the same as when it was first installed
4,Metra997603.,"It was very easy to install. So far it has worked great for me. It fits a little rigid, but it looks great!"
3,"If you have the Bose System, Don't even bother.","If you are buying this for a Mazda that has a Bose Sound System, don't waste your time. In order to install this with a third party cd player you need to gut the entire bose speaker system and install new stuff. Also I recently bought the iPod adapter for the Mazda6, but I have the 2004 model and that is the only model that changed something with the stereo. So I have to completely open up the stereo to get at the mother board and solder two connectors together. (Oh, I found out about this after I bought the $120 part) Fine, I can deal with that, I take the stereo apart and solder the connections together and... voilà! It works fine and great, until it gets cold, low 20's and colder, then it just stops working completely. WTF!!"
5,French songs luminously performed,"OK, quibble all you want with Dawn Upshaw's French pronunciations...I'm told the French find American accents ""sexy."" Upshaw and Kalish bring remarkable interpretive skill to these performances. The Debussy ""Chansons de Bilitis,"" set poems by one of the composer's best friends to music of exquisite, almost erotic playfulness. Similarly, Faure's ""Chanson d'Eve"" is a remarkably beautiful late work of serene detachment. I'm not a big fan of Messian's music, but Upshaw and Kalish certainly make the most of these difficult and ""ecstatic"" songs. All told, with the delicious Golijov song tossed in, a lush treat."
3,A good offering for the price,"This is a good rendition of Orwell's classic Animal Farm. And a good value for the low price [but you may be able to find it a little cheaper].Some additional info from the DVD back:Animal Farm, Britain's first animated feature, is based on George Orwell's classic novel, which has been on school reading lists since its creation. It is set on a farm in England and depicts a revolution by the resident animals vs. Farmer Jones. The use of animals to represent the different social classes is masterful. This picturesque animation feature is a satire based on the Soviet Union of old. offering humor and irony meant for both children and adults. It was prophetic in detailing the events that would occur in Eastern Europe stating in 1989.Starring: Gordon Heath [narrator], Maurice Denham [voices]Director: Joy Batchelor, John Halas"
2,I need more,"Maybe I am too old for this movie but even my niece could not sit through it. Mild comedy, only for children and nothing for adults."
3,"Good indeed, but not among his best stuff","Ivan Rebroff is one of the best, in my opinion the absolute best, voices of this century. In 1989, when Russia opened itself up to the world, he finally could do a tour in Russia. This CD is quite good, but I do prefere other CD's such as the Glasnost-Perestroika one which contains really good songs in both German and Russian. This Cd however contains only Russian lyrics, which unfortunately I cannot understand. It's got some really good stuff though and some songs I never heard before, but his voice isn't quite as good as it used to be."
1,Completely Worthless,"I bought these for my epson stylus C62. After following instructions of cleaning the printer heads, I was able to print exactly 2 sheets and no more. This was also true for the black ink rhinoteck cartridges that I bought. A complete waste of money. I then bought the authentic epson cartridge which is presently printing perfectly."
1,T041020-RC4 order,i ordered T041020-RC4 whiach a 4 pack of the cartridge only received 1 cartrige. same for T040120-RC4. a major ripoff!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!
2,Dystopian novel turns into Alternative History novel,"Everything was going well until the last two chapters. It was a Dystopian novel where boy meets girl he's not supposed to get involved with, Government intervenes (because the Government always knows best), how will our couple get out of this? It was part Milton, part Huxley, a bit sexist but given the time when it was written, that's to be expected. And then it took a dramatic turn and went off the deep end. It turned into an Alternative History/time travel novel, the nature of which bothered me due to its religous context. It could've been an A novel if the author had merely ended it a little sooner."
5,Ashes on the Sea recommends this book,"This is not only a book, it is a practical tool for people who want to take control of what happens before and after their death. This book will guide your family members in following your wishes, and can SIGNIFICANTLY reduce the cost of your Memorial Service or Funeral. It can thus bring peace of mind in a usually confusing time for everyone involved. Easy to read, and full of suggestions, organizations, and contacts. Ashes on the Sea (ashesonthesea.com) recommends this book."
4,"""357 Magnum, 9mm handgun, AK47, and an uzi sub-machine gun""","It is uncharacteristic of me to write a review on an album like this, but I have to, because it's good! This was one of the first and only ska albums I ever had, along with Skankin' Pickle and a handfull of others. ""More Noise..."" is fantastic. I ended up buying their next couple albums, only to be very dissapointed. This album stands alone, in my mind, as the only good Bosstones album."
5,"Heck, it deserves 7 stars","It's just plain and simple. This is a really good cd. I love it. I get a kick out of the song ""Bad in Plaid"", it's awesome! I also like the song ""Cowboy Coffee"". If you're ready for some heavy ska, then this is the cd for you. It drives my mom crazy!! So get ready to turn your stereo up full blast and party!! Okay, you might want to get some friends over first. But, hey, I like noise that's why I'm livin' where I am."
4,ska-rific,"This has become my favorite Bosstones album, bumping 'Let's Face It' to a very close second. 'I'll Drink To That' is probably my favorite Bosstones song. In fact, the first seven tracks on this album are fantastic, with the only slowdown occuring at the start of 'Guns And The Young'. It almost seems awkward to have the Bosstones delivering a serious message. Aren't these guys just about partying and ripping through their unique blend of ska-punk-rock? Nevertheless, a very excellent outing and definitely the first album I would recommend for purchase to anyone getting into the Bosstones."
4,Flameworking Madeto Look Easy,As a novice flameworker this book has given me the desire to move forward and do more than just beads. It provides detailed instructions with pictures to move into other types of glassworking.
2,Title Misleading,"Conventional Lampworking generally refers to soft glass, but this book deals with borosilicate or ""hard Glass"". Since I wanted a book on soft glass ""moretti"" I was extremely disappointed."
3,Good Read,"This book is a good read, but as a boro artist I found that it was a bit simplistic and did not cover much in the way of new techniques. Much of the book had the same design concept put together in a different way - a beginners book."
4,Mears's Flameworking book,"I like the book a lot and am more than pleased with the projects. I love that there is a progression of more difficult projects that build skills. Unfortunately, the writing and pictures are not set up alongside each other, and where the directions are not easy to follow, the photos are not right beside the text (rather, they are on a different page) to clarify the directions.This book is a lot better than the couple of books I have read in the library which had lots of pictures but no really clear directions to help a person make the projects they describe. So, I give this one a 4, and I do recommend it to people who do basic bead making and glass fusing and know a number of the simpler techniques. This book will take you further and make flameworking and fusing many times more fun."
4,Good book for boro glass work,"I am a new lampworker, more interested in soft (Moretti/Effetre) glass, so this book wasn't as helpful as I had hoped since it focuses solely on ""hard"" glass. But the techniques and instructions are well written and would be very helpful."
4,Great company,The product shipped fast and I was impressed with the way it came packaged. The necklace looks exactly like it does in the photo. Very true to size.
4,Silver Turquoise pendant is sterling,"The Sterling Silver Turquoise Pendant by Sajen is a very nice gift for the price. It's sturdy, sleek and sexy. And it makes for a nice surprise gift to share before, during or after dinner."
3,Pendant review,"I was very disappointed with the actaul size of this pendant when it arrived. It's a lot smaller than it looked online. States it's one inch, but that's not the case."
1,Pendant is much smaller than you would think based on the picture. Made for a petite woman or a chld.,"This pendant was way too small. I realize that you must magnify to get a better look at the gemstone and the casting but this was small enough for a child.It would not even fit a 2mm omega, just a thicker chain that you may have. It was pretty, that's why I bought it but I like big and bold and this didn't even come close."
5,More ornate than picture suggests,"The necklace is much prettier than the picture. It is not a large pendant, but the intricate details are more pronounced than the picture shows. It is elegant."
5,beautiful,"I love this! stone is just the right size for me, beautiful Turquoise blue, and details is so pretty.I wear this everywhere. goes well on any kind of cusual outfits."
5,should be required viewing in schools,"This film is a masterpiece and should be required viewing in sociology, anthropology, humanities, etc... classes as well as schools of law and business."
4,Re-released in 10 CD budget box with all sonatas for -$30!,"Fine DDD sound, spontaneity and warmth. Worth your time, but don't buy this OOP edition, IMHO. The new Capriccio C7125 is the Schubert deal of the decade."
5,reminiscent of the sure and gentle touch of Alice Hoffman's,"Carrie Brown is a wonderful and rewarding find. Her touch is both gentle and firm as she investigates the persistence of love after death. She is wise without being didactic, full of immediate feelings without being sentimental. The sense of infinite return, of journeys outward and inward is carefully and lovingly given voice. Brava!"
4,"Very skillful, entertaining novel about life","This book was very enjoyable. I especially like Carrie Brown's skillful interweaving of the plot, past & present, as the story went on. Although some book reviewers have made much of the ghost aspect of the book, it plays a fairly minor role, really ... more of a catalyst to the main character's thoughts about the past than a central feature of every page. The relationship of the main character to his pigeons, and to his father in law through the pigeons was what I thought was the most exciting & interesting part of the book. This volume is another successful choice by Amazon competitor, Barnes & Noble, in its first novel series. I haven't gone wrong yet in this series, although some of the books were stronger than others."
1,Total snooze fest,"I couldn't even finish this book, it was so boring! The author's descriptions were so laden with ""images"" that it was very distracting, resulting in a heavy narrative that was not in the least bit entertaining. It was also quite annoying the way she bounced back and forth between past and present. Maybe if she had injected some humor and lightness in the story I could have related more. I really don't get why this was even published."
4,You must read this book!,"I felt this book come alive for me. Carrie Brown's mastery of words and the characters she has created have stirred my emotions, and left me with a warm and wonderful feeling. I highly recommend it!"
1,I could not have been more bored!,"I didn't expect an action novel, but if I wanted to read about flowers, I would have bought a garden manual! Nothing happens in this story--there is no story! There are so many holes in the exposition that the author leads you to believe will be filled, but never are. The plot is stale: old man is sad...oh wait, he's getting sadder...he's near death and wishes he'd die...gee that's sad. It takes more to move my heart than a one sentence idea stretched into 300 pages!"
2,"Bogged down in excess imagery, story sinks","Powerful imagery of nature, no matter how well worked or oft repeated (excessively so, here) carries a thin plot and superficial characterizations only so far. This book has the 'spirit' of a strong short story at its heart, but the sometimes tortuous stretching of the raw material, with the repeated and eventually excessive and ultimately numbing imagery is finally very unsatisfying, like the aroma of a meal that doesn't really exist. Plot inconsistencies, pidgeons with profound symbolic importance who just 'disappear' from the story, and annoying lapses (Rose and Conrad meet as 11 yr olds and yet Rose's headstone proclaims her 5 yrs Conrad's junior at her death) ultimately drown the waterlogged prose of beautiful imagery overgrowing itself like Rose's untended garden."
2,Didn't live up to this reader's expectations,"I bought this book with great anticipation of a well written, stirring story about a husband's struggle to go on after his wife's death. It is very poetic and lyrical, but I kept waiting for the moment when I would be totally engrossed in the book, and that never happened. My favorite parts were the interactions with his pigeons as well as with the woman who brings him dinners who was looked after by Rose. In the end, however, I finished that last sentence feeling unsatisfied. Next time, I won't so eagerly purchase a book recommended by Barnes and Noble."
1,A sentimental novel; does not live up to its promise.,"Widower Conrad spies an angel in his deceased wife's garden. It's all down hill from there. He has many flashbacks about his moody, wise, humane wife, but she never became believeable to me as a reader. Conrad mucks around trying to figure out what his life should be about without his beloved Rose. Towards the end, a deus ex machina-like plot device of a flood brings crisis and meaning to Conrad's life, but most readers will be asleep by then. This much-hyped novel which ties in with the (yawn) angel craze, is a poorly edited, overlong manuscript full of description and very little character development or plot.... Occasionally, there are bright spots, such as moments when Conrad works with his homing pigeons, but I for one do not see how this book got so popular. I forced myself to finish it but it wasn't worth my time (apologies to the author)."
1,Rose's Garden,"The book didn't really get going until the very end. Too many ""flowery"" descriptions. If I had a nickel for every adjective in the book, I'd be rich. The pigeons were the most interesting things in the story."
1,Didn't grab me!,I just could not get into this book and I abandoned it. It might have just been the mood I was in.
5,I Love This Show!!!,"I really love this show. The comedy and setting is so great. I love Derwin and ""Med School"". I also love Tasha Mack cause she keep it real and speaks what's on her mind. All in all this is a great show so DON'T MISS OUT ON GETTING THE DVD!!!!!! I have already PRE-ORDERED!!!!!"
3,Quick ship,The dvd set shipped in a timely manner. The only issues is that two episodes on disc 3 would skip so I was not able to watch every episode in its entirety.
4,Endlessly Entertaining,"Back before BET botched this show, Season 1 was hilarious without being over the top. The cast is so funny and they all work well together! Great for a laugh and a lazy Saturday marathon!"
3,Entertaining but at a curious inbetween level of detail,"I have an old Steinway that could use some work. I bought this book in the hope that it would give sufficient detail to actually undertake the work, but it is more a guided tour to let one know what a real technician would do. A lot of information is given, but not in either enough detail or with sufficient completeness to allow it to be considered an instruction manual. I also hoped to learn some more about the detailed mechanics of the tuning process -- the points of friction, and lubricants that one could use on the pin block to allow a faster convergence to the desired pitch -- but this was not at all discussed.That said, it is entertaining and educative, and is probably a very useful introduction to a more complete text (I am still looking for that!)."
2,too complicated for a beginner,"My 2 stars rating doesn't mean that Reblitz's book is not good; in fact, it's a perfectly fine and authoritative book if---and I stress IF---you are already a professional technician with an understanding of piano tuning and its many intracasies. Reblitz makes the mistake so many knowledgeable writers make, that is, he explains concepts and ideas as if you, the customer, were already in the know. In fact, I think many have traditionally confused the encyclopedia-like character of this book with it being a good teaching aid but it's much overrated in this department. In fact, I found the instructions to being often overly complicated, sometimes vague, incomplete, and not very emphatetic to the reader, as a student. In short, buy this book if you want a professional referecence. But spend your money on a correspondence, or other course if you really want to learn piano tuning."
5,Review,"First time ever shop on the site,Fast postage , good quality,wish i could receive even cheaper on the postage cost !"
4,Tired of not being able to retouch tuning on your own piano?,"This book is very comprehensive and, though I'm just an amateur tired of having little tuning glitches I must call a tuner for, I have spent several weeks learning to tune my own piano. I look forward to hiring someone again and have a much higher appreciation of piano tuners!"
3,"A very complete reference, but complicated...","This book is an extremely complete reference, however it might not be the best choice for someone looking for a quick read on how to tune their piano. Only two chapters (6-7) really address the theory, techniques and mechanics of tuning. The rest of the book is a reference for repair and restoration.However, the two chapters on tuning are excellent. The technique is broken down into 5-6 exercises that act as tutorials to get you started. I thought that tuning my piano was going to be like tuning any stringed instrument. Now I know that isn't the case at all!I read the tuning section last night and plan on starting my tuning this weekend..."
5,"Piano servicing, tuning, and rebuilding: for the professional, the student and the hobbyist","An excellent - and long recognized - classic in its field. Although the first edition is now some 25 years old, it has become recognized within the piano tuning profession as THE definitive reference for apprentice piano technicions as well as the professional. The book is organized in a logical and precise manner, beginning with a history of piano styles, the operation of the myriad of parts making up the action, a thorough section on cleaning and repair, as well as regulating and tuning of pianos. Finally there is an excellent section on restoration rebuilding.Take the wealth of information in the firsdt edition, subject this to a thorough up-dating in his second, and Reblitz is a ""must read"" for anyone interested in entering the tuning profession, as well as for persons simply interested in the intrument they may be playing.I highly recommend this book - a five star without doubt"
4,Good book for learning to rebuild and tune a piano,"For the most part, this easy to follow and comprehend. It is a must for anyone wishing to rebuild, restore and tune a piano."
5,Piano Servicing Book,This is very technical but the explanations are easy to understand.I have read and reread it and reread it many times. As a resultI was able to repair my piano and save at least $700 in repair costsBy a piano tech.The author did a most remarkable job of communicating every detail.Please understand that without mechanical aptitude to a high degree a personwould not be wise to tackle any major piano repair. In my case I had 16 sluggish keysdue to hinge and pin clearances at the whippen and hammer butt.I was lucky because no corrosion has occurred. Repair was very labor intensive and requiredmuch patience.
2,Popularized Tripe,"If you want the why and the wherefore ... stay away. Informative to general audiences, it provides little scientific support for its contention. With the wealth of information out there, this was not the critical review needed, nor was it terribly informative about any particular statin-caused effect."
5,Patients Beware,"I would respectfully suggest that anyone on a statin drug read this book on Lipitor and OTHER BOOKS BY JAY S COHEN ONE BEING WHAT YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT STATIN DRUGS AND THEIR ALTERNATIVES AND THE MAGNESIUM SOLUTION AFTER YOU HAVE READ ALL THREE BOOKS DISCUSS SAME WITH YOUR DOCTOR. YOU OWE THIS TO YOURSELF, YOUR LOVED ONES AND TO ANY ONE WHO YOU KNOW WHO IS TAKING DRUGS FOR CHOLESTEROL OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE THAT YOU MIGHT TALK TO"

4,Pretty Cool,"This is exactly what my daughter asker for for christmas - weird kid. But it's built pretty sturdy and It's small enough for small hands. She wanted a lockable chest, and this one has a cool little skill that locks it closed.It could use a few more things inside, but all in all, my 5-year old loved it."
4,OK,"Unfortunately, I would have to agree with the other reviews about the color of this treasure chest. It's more of a green color with random green dots on it, not so much of a brown as it looks in the picture. It hasn't been played with yet (saving to give as a gift) so I'm not sure if I'll experience the issue with the top coming off. I am still pretty pleased with it and I know my little pirate will love it!"
2,Color of the box is inaccurate,"My son was so excited to get this in the mail, fortunately he's easy enough to please but I was expecting a gold-ish colored treasure chest and what we received was SILVER WITH GREEN SPOTS! If I had known it was going to be this ugly I would have ordered a different one. Why would a treasure chest have gold quarter sized spots on it anyways? What is it supposed to be mold? Not a fan of this toy being so grossly misrepresented. The colors aren't even close to what's pictured for sale."
1,Misleading!,"I was very disapointed with the color of this treasure chest. I thought it would be brown as pictured. When I received it, it was grey with 4 green random paint spots on it. Not even close to the picture. The quality is good, but it is so ugly. I wanted it because I had recently done over my son's room to a pirate theme and thought this could go on his bureau...there's no way. Grossly misrepresented!"
2,Much larger than expected.,"This item is much larger than it appears in the photo. The chest measures 9.5""x8""x7"" which is surprisingly big. Sure would take alot of treasure to fill it! The few coins it comes with seems silly sitting on the bottom of it. Bring your our gold."
1,if there were zero stars......,"This pirate chest is a total rip off. The chest is cheaply made and the contents inside are minimal. When I ordered it as a gift for someone, they sent me someone else's order....then refused to let me return my item for a refund when I finally received it. The company was very rude and not helpful in the mix up at all."
5,Great for a Pirate Party,We had a lot of fun with this at my son's fifth birthday. We used the flag to hang over the table. The coins and pirate chest were used in a treasure hunt. He loved wearing the eye patch. Melissa and Doug make great stuff. This was fun.
3,Bought two of these for my grandsons,"I bought two of these for my two grandsons for christmas last year.Ages six and four, decided to wait giving it to the younger one due to the design of the hinge. Can be broken very easily, Needs a hinge that allows the top to swing all the way down, not stopping half way to be snapped off!My older grandson loves it and has been playing with it off and on for almost a year now."
4,Pirates,"This is a Christmas gift, so don't know how the child will like it. I think it's its well made and I added additional pirate ""stuff"" to the already amount was in the chest. Plenty of room to add things"
2,"Great toy, poor construction","Our kids LOVE treasure chests, we hide things in them and play pirate often. We bought this toy for our son for Christmas and by the end of that day the top of the chest had fallen off! The hinge is secured with rivets and evidently these are not strong enough to secure the top of the chest! Now we have a chest in two pieces, rendering it useless! The wood seems to thin to try and replace the rivets with screws, but at this point we may try that just to give it one last chance. For $22.00 it should be much more durable!"
3,"Seems like ""second"" qualty",I bought this for my son to store his rock collection. His big brother already uses on for the same purpose. I am so disappointed because this has big green paint spots on it and is missing metal hardware handles on the side. It seems like it is second quality. It did arrive in plastic with the Melissa and Doug cardboard. I am puzzled why this one differs from the first one I bought in a store.I recommend the treasure chest but I am disappointed with the one Amazon sent me. I wanted to investigate with Amazon if I had bought a second or but it seems like my only choices are to keep it or return it.
1,false description,"according to the description,there are ornate brass handles, no so in fact there are NO handles at all, very disappointed, would not have purchased if I had known!"
2,the chest broke so fast!,"kids loved it, but the chest broke aftyer 4 days of play ..... i was expecting sturdier .three more words required for the feedback? why??"
4,Great Find!,"I purchased this pirate chest for my 5 yr old grandson, but it could easily be used for a child several years older as well. First of all, good luck finding a pirate chest in a store-they don't have them in Target, Walmart or Toys R us. This chest also contains a pirate flag, eye patch and coins in a pouch, and has a ""secret compartment"" in it. Even the ""lock"" on the outside is fun and easy to use once you show the child how, and no key to lose. Also, it's sturdy, not like some other cardboard ones you might see online. This was my grandson's favorite Christmas present."
3,Good Pirate Chest.,"The pirate chest is nice, and the cute bag of coins is a nice bonus. The flag was oddly shaped, and my son didn't look twice at the eye-patch. The chest is a little green colored, but that didn't bother me much. The hinges on the chest are almost coming off and we hardly ever play with it. I have to watch my kids to make sure they're being careful with it."
1,There are far better career guides on the market than this one,"This book is extremely superficial in its approach to defining a career and job search, so superficial as to possibly do more harm than good. Poorly written, this volume that might be of some use to the novice job seeker but of little use to anyone seeking more detailed and substantiated information. The chapter on writing resumes is almost useless."
2,Not what I expected.,"Should have read the review more thoroughly. This is an okay book, but doesn't have any new ideas--guess that's because it's about 20 years old! Wish I had noticed that small detail and saved myself some money. Don't waste yours on something that won't be very helpful."
5,Terrific Product!,My son is learning how to juggle and these have been perfect for him. He has already been in a Talent Show and used them in front of a crowd of about 300 people. They showed up well from the back of the audience and he enjoyed using them.
2,Not the best,"when i bought them they wernt yellow, red, and blue they had no colors just some crapey tape!other than that there descent, but if you catch them wrong they hurt bad! so dont buy them! unless your are ok with them being harhley hard! and dont care about the colors!"
3,"Good subject, but poor editing","I bought this book because my work is in information reporting and I thought it would provide an interesting perspective. It did succeed at that. Because I come from a technical background, I had a little trouble getting started with the book, until I released it was written from a sociology background. Once I got past that I enjoyed the book except for the ...extremely poor editing. There were numerous grammatical and sentence structure errors, contradicting statements misspellings and general redundancy that really detracted from the information being presented."
3,Very Interesting,"I very much enjoyed this book, but like two other reviewers, noticed many technical writing errors. I still found the content fascinating and a good read, but the errors are distracting and that is the only reason why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5. The fact that I would bump it down to 3 stars instead of 4 based on that one criteria should give you an idea of just how bad the editting was. However, even with that said, I would still highly recommend the book if the topic is of interest."
5,Elmo At His Best,"Our two year old grandson loves Sesame Street and Elmo, and the Valentine's Day DVD is no exception. The story line is easy for him to follow with his favorite characters. This was a winner for us to watch more of ""Mo."""
5,We love elmo,My little one is an Elmo fanatic. We love everything about Elmo and Sesame Street. She's learning a lot from this videos. This one was very cute as Elmo talks about love and emotions. I recommend this movie.
4,Elmo Loves You,"Bought this product for my grandchildren to watch, they love Elmo and Sesame Street. Great learning tools for young children."
3,Not bad,My 18 month daughter loves Elmo. This video is good but doesn't have the same format as her other Elmo videos so she doesn't get to try to sing the songs and such. Still worth the $.
1,Revisionist Junk History Disguised as a Textbook,"Bad history is one thing. Bad history that is put into textbook form is even worse. Lafeber is one of those revisionist historians who love to talk about the big bad US and the poor Russians and the misunderstood Stalin. This book as with most revisionist history is an attempt to justify some sort of left-wing political agenda. Just read how the book makes Henry Wallace into some sort of hero while Harry Truman is made into a villian. This book often ignores the facts and current documentary evidence. For good cold war history read Gaddis, or Ferrell not this!"
1,Estimating home building costs,Out of date.Does not contain new construction methods such as steel framing.
4,A Shocking Trip Down Memory Lane,"Just finished this book and couldn't believe how many of the scandals I had forgot over the last decade. I guess I can be forgiven as there were an endless string of mismanagement, political power to extremes and maybe even possibly criminal activity.Paul Tunn has written the textbook on the Chrétien years, it makes for a historical review of that decade. But beyond the scandal it is how the PM used the power of the office to confuse the issue, demonize the accuser and never apologize.Paul's book also sheds light on the current PM, his relationship with Chretien, and how he learned to handle scandals of his own.Once you've read this book you can see the game plan play out the next time a scandal hits.

1,Wireless Router Failure,"365 days after installation, the wireless malfunctioned. Netgear had me download a new system to the router and then the Mac G-4 could not be connected even after repeated ""suggestions"" by Netgear. If you want a reliable wireless router, do not buy Netgear!"
3,"Nice, but no presentation","Only box with router, nice product, high speed, but no manual, support or warranty, i hope work finely. 20$ Bucks product of the year!"
5,"A Rockin' Good Time with ""The Lost Rock""!","My daughter has loved ""Between the Lions"" since she was under a year. She still may not understand how to spell yet, but she loves to dance to the songs and laughs at many of the characters. From tooth to fish, my daugher is soaking information up, and loving it. Her favorite episode is 'The Lost Rock'. I agree, it has the best songs to dance to. I just wish there were more videos available. I'll watch those lions over Barney any day."
5,Outstanding CD !!!!,"The songs are OUTSTANDING! Superb, moving, really-hit-home lyrics, and excellent guitar work! Brian"
1,Wrong Book Received,"I would have rather received We Serve; A book of the Lions Clubs instead of The Lion of Wall Street. I guess when the sale is farmed out, sometimes the results aren't so good."
1,Terrible,This book is just a bunch of stories that were printed in the authors others books. Not worth the money I spent
1,Garbage,"Hollywood is arguably THE hotbed of sordid secrets, but this reality isn't enough to suit John Austin's bizarre and paranoid fantasies. Most of his claims in this horrendously written and edited book are highly speculative and singularly devoid of documentation, unless one considers a-source-who-can't-be-identified acceptable documentary evidence -- I do not. By the way, his chapter on Vicki Morgan is particularly ludicrous.In addition, Mr. Austin comes across as a pompous weirdo, usually referring to himself as ""we"" and to Hollywood's power structure as the ""oligarchy."" I'm also confused by his negative attitude toward the Reagan Administration, while paradoxically ranting about liberals.Oh, avoid this book as though it were contaminated by every communicable disease known to man."
3,A Fine Romance,"A typical British comedy, although not as funny as ""Fawlty Towers"" or ""Are you Being Served?"", it still is hilarious in most cases. A willing woman and a doubtful man. What a combination!"
5,Really good music from Paul Zaleski,"All the grooves are there and the melodies are haunting. Every song smooths out even the worst of moods. The music gets your toe tapping while you're humming the melodies.This music is not a demonstration of electronic wonder or a flash in the pan. This music sounds like it came from the heart. The combination of the piano,flutes and choir background just sets the mood. The grooves are solid and the production is flawless.I really enjoyed the CD I heard.It's really not jazz or new age. It doesn't remind you of anyone, yet when you listen to it, it seems to just fit."
3,"Good writen concepts, but lax character development","I am a great fan of the Shadowrun univers and found the book Never Deal With a Dragon to be interesting. The plot line was difficult to follow at times and didn't begin to come to gether till the end. The thing that bothered me the most was Sam Verner's (protagonist) constent state of ambevolence. Though his ambevolence was understandable he would atamatically disagree with every situation, then acquiesce without argument. It made for a somewhat paper thin protagonist. Sam's group didn't have any realistic motavation to help him to achive his goals. The characters acted out of unreasonable philanthropy for the dark and dangerous setting of Shadowrun. Some of the redeeming values of the book (one inperticular) was it's interesting plot ""Twist"" involving magic. The overall story concept was also good. The novel was an OK read though with its flaws it does contain some high points."
3,No 1,This was the first one. This book of Shadowrun is one of the best in the series (If not T H E B E S T). It is so good that I read it three times. In my opinion if you like the shadowrun books and have a collection This book must be in it. Enjoy the book
4,I dont like pie,this book is the only shadowrun book ive read and it was one of the best books ive ever read anyone who likes shadowrun should read it
4,Magic has returned to the Earth. Only some can use it.,"A young Corporation man who has a strange talent for shamanic magic is searching for his sister. Unknown to him there are others trying to keep him away from finding out the dark secret regarding her whereabouts. Enter the Shadowrunners. Street mercenary teams that use bionic technology, computer nets and magic who will do almost anything ...for a price. This book takes you to the future of Earth when magic and technology combine, Governments collapse, and the old legends of monsters and Gods return. You will not be sorry for reading this book. Its only the tip of the Shadowrun iceberg."
3,A good start to an excellent series.,"This book is the least engaging of the three, but is still a good read. I find its place in the series to be satisfactory. Everything gets better as the series progresses. The best shadowrun series."
4,The Future holds many a mystery in the shadows...,"Its the literary pieces such as this one which inspire the human mind, sending it on journeys and adventures untold and unnumbered. To worlds unknown with skies of myriad colors where dragons fly and elves fight orcs... ...And Technology comes back to haunt the shadows of the fantasy world in your mind... ...Wheres part 2?"
5,Not William Gibson's world... but the same genre.,"someone below said that this is built on William Gibson's cyberpunk world with a twist. If you're a sci-fi afficionado, that statement is misleading. Firstly, Gibson to my knowledge invented the cyberpunk genre (coined the term cyberspace, even), and since then, many have followed in his steps. It's not based on Gibson's world... it's written in his _genre_. The ""Shadowrun"" world is based on a role-playing game which has a MUCH different feel to it. Of course, that feel varies between authors, but Gibson's worlds tend to feel much harsher to me. There seems to be more warmth in most of the Shadowrun books I've read. Especially this series by Charette: my favorite Shadowrun books by far, and this is my favorite of the series. A very fun read."
1,Beware the evil software...it *will* destroy your system...,"This is a perfectly good prep course, ruined by horrid software. I bought the version expressly designed for Windows. For inexplicable reasons, the CD with the practice tests uses the Mozilla browser, which is highly incompatable with Windows. When you install the software, Mozilla will destroy all IE and Netscape settings you may have, and causes the performance of your entire system to degrade by a factor of 2x to 5x, depending upon the application. That's because much, if not all, Windows software uses IE, NOT Mozilla. You'd think that if the software was designed for Windows, they'd use Windows-optimized software plug-ins. But...no. Furthermore, the uninstall program doesn't work; it crashes about 30 seconds into the cycle, so you can't remove it OR Mozilla from your system. In short, you are sent into bit-bucket hell. If the software was as good as the book, I would be giving a very different review."
3,book purchase review,I was pleased with the very timely delivery of this book purchase so I can have it before class starts!! The inside is good condition with minimal highlighting and writing but the outside cover had a little more wear and tear than i liked (and than the pic shows...) but still overall pretty satisfied with my purchase.
5,A dreamlike blend of electronic noise and hushed voices.,"As loud and abrasive as the opening chords to this album are, they make the beautiful melodies that follow all the more lulling. A direct descendent of My Bloody Valentine, this group understands and wonderfully demonstrates the use of noise mixed with ethereal lethargy. Not to be missed by the fans of UK noise bands like 'adorable' and 'Ride.'"
5,MBV? Nah.,"The Swirlies were an excellent band, whom idolised My Bloody Valentine and have often been compared to them, yet I have a hard time putting them together, mainly because the Swirlies just have a cleaner sound and the vocals are more pronounced, but they definitely have that MBV sound to them. I dont know, judge for yourself, but all I can say, is this is an excellent CD that anyone could enjoy. Its a great driving CD and youll never get tired of it."
3,Good story but...,Gail Ramsey has a good basis for a story here but the way it was excuted was fairly poor. The dialogue and description of the action didn't flow and lacked incredibly. It needs to be tightened up. I'm curious to see how her other novels read.
1,"Tick Tock, no thanks","Although there is a story there, the author tells it in such a stilted disheveled manner, that it doesn't make the book enjoyable to read. Not bad for a debut, but not the page-turner others seem to think it is. The main character seems to have a brilliant legal mind but no moral compass when it comes to her personal life."
3,Ship for less,"Over all it is a nice model ship and does include string for rope. My one main gripe about this ship is the crew, or rather the lack of. In fact there is nothing in the instructions or box to prove there is crew. I wonder after seeing some of the other ships being sold, how historical are these. Overall a great one to put together."
2,Battle of the bands 4,"The cd came in a cracked case, and only had 2 choice cuts on it. A total waste of $39.00"
5,Great,My husband is enjoying the product. I would buy again. Thanks so much for the smaller package. It helps to test!
4,JUST ONE MORE KISS...,"UNREAL! Remember the line, ""Just one more kiss...""... well this collection is enough to savour your eager taste. Its been a long time waiting since i have been looking for Gene & Paul's contribution to the movie 'Reform School Girls' and WOOHOO!!! Its released in this box set (Its My Life). Im happy just owning this for that single song. Thankyou 'KISS' for lifetime of rock'n'roll classics... i know your flames won't burn out.:)"
4,kiss-the box set,i bought this because i'm a die hard fan. i was most intereseted in the demos and outtakes and there are plenty of them. my only complaint is that i wish all the songs that are available in other countries were released on the set. take a look at the killers cd. i know it is not a complete set of every song they ever did but i still wish all the non album b sides were included. one disc was only 65:00 mins long.
5,THIS IS THE BEST,"I'M A LONG TIME KISS FAN AND TO HAVE THESE HARD TO FIND SONGIN ONE IS GREAT, WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY , IF YOU ARE A KISS FAN THIS IS A MUST HAVE"
3,Review Of Boxed Set,"When Kiss was doing their Convention tour way back in 1994, we we're told by Kiss themselves that A boxed set would be coming out, that would be like no other-it would have Kiss material featuring Eddie van halen on guitar, and more-Bull! The boxed set that was just released, Is a collection of material that people already have, on bootleg, etc. why should kiss fans buy this boxed set, if they already have all the martrial already??? that makes no sense! My advice, if you don't already have this, and your a Kiss fan, buy it. If you already have the material that is on this boxed set, don't shell out your hard earned money."
4,yes I got sucked in,"Yes I did buy this obnouxious box set (Limited edtion) but I love It. The guitar case is kool and I love the hard cover edtion of the liner notes. but most of all I really like the demo's and early materiel you get kinda of a sneek peek into the process and who did what,if you are any kind of a fan you need to add this set to your collection (maybe not the limited )the content makes this one of the better sets to come out.I can't wait for aliveIV."
4,When will box set two arrive?,"This is a great item for the hardened Kiss fan, but it could have been so much better.I have most of the 64 previously released tracks two or three times already, so why repeat them here on what is obviously(at this price) a hardened fans item.I'm sure that there are alternative live versions of the tracks that could have been substituted.That said the packaging and book are wonderful,so I grudgingly recommend this.Basically, if you're a Kiss fan you will want it,but I am sure there is enough material in the vaults for a second box set!"
2,kiss box set,"I think it's so sad when bands come out with box sets and ruin it. I was really excited to hear about this box set until i saw that most songs are live or demos. They should at least start out with a box set that has the original songs on them which is why they were so popular. After that is done, then by all means do your rareties. I was very disappointed, i was so looking forward to buying but now i have no interest."
5,"""Why were our Reformers burned""","This book. ""Why were our Reformers burned"" written by the late Bishop J. C. Ryle, in my opinion, is worth its weight in gold!"
2,Title deceptive not suited for very young children,"I purchased this for children 3-5 years of age and it actually frightened them, It would perhaps suit an older group of children"
5,Great Kid Movies & for those who love fairy tales,My favorite all time fairytale movie is Puss in Boots. The two lead actors are adorable. Beauty & the Beast is an odd but interesting rendition - but I truly like the plot line. All story-lines are well handled and brought fully to life.
4,"A Model Airplane Classic, useful also for piloted aircraft","This is the most sophisticated and comprehensive book on model airplane design that I have read. It is also a book on piloted airplane design, because it was written before the two diverged so far. In addition to history, it is useful to anyone doing anything out of the lines of previous development.My flight scripts for the Second Life virtual reality environment may not have become so real that I needed this background, but it was reassuring when I was working on them that I had this along with my other sources to take from when needed. I strongly recommend this to anyone else who finds himself making flying models in unique environments like this virtual reality with a physics that only roughly corresponds to that of the real world."
1,Looks better in the picture,"This cabinet is made, for the most part, from particle board. The quality of the materials and the finish are sub-par for the cost of this unit. I have seen better quality of similar products from Walmart for half the price. The cabinet pieces did not fit well together. I had to trim the back piece with a saw so it would fit. The shelves are not finished black on the bottoms. Since this cabinet hangson the wall, you only see the bottoms of the shelves. Turn them over, you say. No, they wont work with the adjustable pegs that way. I have it hanging on the wall but I am certainly not happy with it."
5,Nice looking and efficient,Looks nice under the wall mount tv and holds lots of DVDs. Easy to assemble and mount. Just what we were looking for
2,Poor Quality Control,"I have put together more complicated Prepac products before so I know how to handle the bad directions you get with these. The backing was not trimmed to fit properly, so it was a pain to get that right. One of the pieces of particle board cracked beyond use/repair during assembly. Also, I am missing the 3 pieces of ""side"" molding (not sure why they call it ""side molding"" when it goes on the front). For $100 I wasn't expecting an heirloom, but a working kit would have been nice. I've emailed Prepac to see what they will do for me. Will update."
4,My opinion.,"Looks nice, however the shipping box was full of sawdust. Every piece had to be whiped down, not to mention the sawdust all over the carpet when the shipping box was opened. Easily assembled and all parts fit nicely. Would have given it a 5 star if not for excessive saw dust."
4,Great product,"I really like these shelves because they look great on my wall, but I wish they held more DVD's. I use them only for my movie collection and there is an akward space at the top that's too small, unless I lay the DVD down. It would be fine for a CD but I think the manufacturer should make them a little bigger. It just looks off to me. Otherwise I love them. They're strong and easy to put together."
1,NOT HAPPY AT ALL,"VERY VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS PRODUCT, I PURCHASE THIS AND DELIVERY WAS FAIR AND QUICK. AFTER SPENDING OVER $100 I WAS VERY UPSET TO RECEIVE MY PACKAGE WITH THE WOOD SCARED AND SCRAPED UP!! ONCE I STARTED THE SET UP ONE THE WOOD PIECES ON THE RIGHT SIDE BROKE WHILE I WAS INSERTING A SCREW!!! I WANT A REFUND OR ANOTHER ONE THIS IS HORRIBLE"
3,"It's OK, it's basic.","It's very simple to assemble. It probably took 15 minutes on the dining room floor. A few parts were too tight, but I was able to remedy the problem with a sharp utility knife. I haven't fully loaded the shelves with DVD's and CD's, but it looks like it should function as advertised.There isn't any ""real"" wood in the construction; this shelf won't be appearing on the Antiques Road Show in 100 years..."
5,productor de calidad,el productor es de buena calidad recomiendo al vendedor por el producto invito a todos los usuarios a comprar a este vendedor gracias...
3,Simply outstanding for its time ...,"... but let's face it, that's over 20 years ago now. Back then you had to look _really_ hard to find anything with even a glimmer of a hint of tips on picking, or (gasp!) practical uses.Michael's later books in the ""Medicinal Plants of the"" -series got steadily better, with the ""Medicinal Plants of the Pacific West"" being the crown of the trio, beating _all_ the other practical guides out there with a very wide margin.Sure, buy this one, if you live in the Mountain West - as likely as not you won't find anything else as good on the plants in _your_ region.Buy it, too, if you're a die-hard Michael Moore -fan. His writing was entertaining back then, too.But if you don't live out there, or don't yet know Michael Moore's writings, go get the Pacific West book instead. And wait for the revision of this, his oldest book. It _should_ be out one of these years."
5,Great Product,Product arrived as advertised. Solid construction and easy to use. I purchased two for both of my cars. I recommend this product.
5,Great for Qi Gong beginers,If you never done Qi Gong this is good start. Easy to follow and gives two levels of difficulty for few exercises. Clear instructions and explanations what its for. My wife loves it. I recommend it.
4,wonderful,"again this is a great work out forpeople that do have disabilites. Ireally enjoy it, I recomend all three"
4,Great for beginners.,"This DVD is wonderful for someone starting out with this type of exercise. However, the format isn't great for actually doing a workout. I would have liked it more if there was an instructional section and then a smooth-transitioning workout section. Also, there could have been 2 different workout sections, one workout using the beginner moves (shorter) and another using the advanced moves.On the positive side, I loved the way Chris explained the movements. His calm voice and the nice background music makes for a wonderful start to any day! For me, personally, I went to You Tube and looked up some other Qi Gong workouts, then combined the moves I had learned from Chris with the timing and dance-like variations I saw online. This combination is working for me."
4,Excellent Qigong Instruction!,"Many reviews say 'for beginners'. Yet, any serious qigong student will find richness and value in this dvd. It is really for all levels of instruction, even for the tai chi nerds who think that they know everything. give it a try guys, you might remember that it is sometimes the easiest forms that has the most to teach."
5,Great for beginners,"Best Qi Gong DVD for beginners that I've found yet. You can do most of the moves by listening to the directions and barely have to watch him demonstrate. When you do look at his demonstrations, he does so in the manner he's instructing you w/o you having to figure out the mirror-image/reversed details. Challenging and Simple at the same time."
4,is ok,"slow explanations , easy to follow , I like special forbegineers , for sure I buy the next dvd , come on time"
5,Love this,I am really good i got this amazing DVD and product at such a great price. I definitely recommend it to people who desire to have some relaxation.
5,Just the DVD I hoped I was purchasing,I find this DVD easy to follow and am feeling so much better and more energized after just 10 days of using it. I have some arthritis and was looking for a good way to stretch and have more flexibility. This is a very easy to follow DVD and I am not one who normally feels like I exercise well from a DVD. Recommended highly.
5,Learn QiGong,Qi (or Chi) Gong is a great way to exercise to control breathing and to relax and this video has helped me learn it to get those benefits with lessons that make it easy to understand.I definately feel more relaxed and giving myself some time to do these exercises is now something I am getting into the habit of doing now for the last couple of months. I am also gaining some flexibility and strength. Hugging The Tree (one of the extra routines in addition to the 8 Pieces) has helped make my upper body stronger.
5,8 Pieces Of Brocade,"A very good video which shows you the 8 Pieces of Brocade parts of Qi Gong. Each piece works on different things, such as flexibility, and Chris Pei does a real nice job of introducing the moves and the benefits that each one provides.He includes easy versions and also has variations for when you get stronger. There are also 3 bonus workouts. I like the subtitles and the way you can choose mirrored/non-mirrored options to follow along."
2,Be aware!,"Please note that, although the DVD cover says that it contains eight qi gong routines, it actually has only one routine -Eight pieces of Brocade- that is composed of eight movements. So you are really only learning ONE qi gong routine. Just saying..."
3,A little slow paced,It is a little slow for the exercises and not as good as the class I took but I will try it a few more times
1,not at all what I wanted or expected,so slow it was almost impossible to follow. Not enjoyable. the instructor is almost in a trance which didn't work for me
4,Not defective,I am updating my review. I gave this product a one star rating previously due to a defect. But now I am able to play it on my DVD player and it seems to work. For now I changed the one star to a 4 star. I will update again after I watch the entire video.
3,Qi Gong,I realy like the DVD it is clear and the sound is wonderful. It's a good starting DVD for beginners.
3,Qi Gong for beginners,"I'm a beginner in Tai Chi and liking it everything is done in slow motion.Tai Chi movements slowly and savely stretch and tone your body from head to toe,increasing muscle control,strenght and balance.Every instructor is different and do have a different ways of teaching, and they are all good.Erik"
5,"Kayla LoCicero's ""Beautiful World"" is a ""Beautiful Experience""","From the playful giggle of ""Beautiful World"" to the emotionally moving lyrics of ""What She Wants"", this is an amazing collection of songs, and Kayla LoCicero's vocals are simply brilliant. You will get lost in the endearing qualities of this beautiful young woman's voice. The songs are catchy yet meaningful... well done and delivered with conviction. ""The Halls of St. Jude"" is a memorable sentimental favorite sure to touch the heart, along with ""Paper Heart"", a playful yet pleasing and notable story of a girls devotion to her father and the loving memories of younger days. This CD has come to be one of the most cherished of my collection... it has become a constant companion. I urge anyone considering this purchase to do so... I know you will love and enjoy it as much as I have. You will be glad you went on this magical musical journey through Kayla's ""Beautiful World""."
5,A Good Rede,"This book is unique in its genre. Although necessarily speculative in nature, it is the product of both detailed academic research, and a long practical experience with runes, magic, and spiritual development.Having read most of the better known authors on runes (Blum, Thorsson, Howard, Pennick, etc), the more New-Agey tend to be poorly researched, while the more historical tend to lack much of an understanding of the psyche. The most dangerous are those that invent plausable sounding systems cobbled together from a mix of historical sources and suspect occult paths.Rune Rede contains a mix of research, experience, common sense, and deep wisdom. It is influenced by Thorsson's ideas, but does a much better job of it. This will not satisfy those looking for a more historical approach, but if you want ideas for the modern uses of runes in psychological and spiritual ways, Rune Rede is the best available.Sweyn Plowrightauthor ofThe Rune Primer: A Down to Earth Guide to the Runes"
3,review for The Crossbreed,"It is an alright book, and very well written, but a real drag at the end. If you want an upbeat ending, do not read this book."
1,What a letdown...,"This box set is a real letdown. Sure all the young fans are probably drooling over it, but die hards know this is a ripoff. I guess all the other ""vault"" stuff that Kiss has bragged about for years is pure garbage or it would have made the box set. Why didn't Kiss do it right and release 10 CD's of rare unreleased stuff??? That would have been impressive. They could have also shoved a DVD into the set as well. Kiss was a visual Band... why no visuals? I've been into Kiss since 1975 and have purchased almost all the albums, 8 tracks, cassettes, and CD's (Twice, since they were remastered a few years ago). I'm not buying into this (...) again. Gene, Paul, wake up and show the world what the greatest band on earth is capable of...."
3,Why This?,"Whwn Kiss was doing their convention tour in 1994, The band had talked about putting together a ""Monster Box Set"" full of stuff that The fans had never heard-And this is what we got. Basically, thhos is an album of stuff that Most Kiss fans already have on bootleg, and it made no sense to me why Kiss choose to release it, Knowing full well that the fans already had the material that is inside of it.there's stuff from Wicked lester(Gene and Paul's old band) on this album, which fans already have, there's the 5 song demo that was recorded by kiss back in the early 70's, which fans already have, etc. I would like to hear Gene's old band ""The Long Island Sounds""(Before Wicked Lester/Kiss), rather than hearing a rehash of ""When the Bell rings""(From Wicked lester), or a rehash of the demoed song ""Strutter"", from their 1972 demo tape. I Think you get my point-Kiss fans we're expecting something different in this boxed set, and got something they already have."
2,The whole set just seems a bit... off.,"I've never understood the concept of a box-set, other than to release previously unreleased material. I mean, if some new comer wanted to get familar with KISS, they would probably go for one of their many Greatest hits records.The box-set should be for the fans, so why are there so many previously released tracks here? The entire unmasked section of their career was skipped over, I mean disc four only has 2 unreleased songs on it. While discs one-three have about 20 or so unreleased songs all together.There are some cool songs that the fans finally did get to hear, such as ""It's my life"", ""Ain't that peculiar"" and the orginal verson of ""God of thunder"", and one of the few things that I was happy about was the inclusion of the unplugged version of ""Got to choose"". But the set as a whole just seems like a glorified 'Greatest hits' package, and I was very disappointed with the track listing."
3,WHERE'S THE BEEF ?,"I was expecting a DVD of live material to be included in the box set,like the Stevie Ray and Double Trouble people did for his box set.Why would I want to spend 2 bills for the deluxe set to get another version of a bunch of stuff that I already have?I am a huge fan,but if I hear one more version of Rock and Roll All Nite I'm gonna puke,and everybody thought the Phsyco Tour was a money grab!"
1,Very Disappointed,"This had the potential to be the mother of all box sets with rare, hard to find and jewel performances from the hallowed halls of the band's history but Gene and Paul really blew it. They didn't give us the Eddie Kramer demos in their entirety and they mixed the Bell Sound demos from the first album in with a bunch of their previously released studio cuts at the time. They could have put out rare demos, studio and live recordings throughout this box set but instead they got the shanks and blew it in their typical fashion. Very cool photos and packaging but the track listing is just atrocious."
2,GENE HYPED IT UP TOO MUCH,"70-80% of this stuff is already out there on other CDs...I'm a diehard fan but undecide if I will buy this or not. I borrowed my cousin's box set(thanks to me, I converted him to KISStianity. ha ha)...I may just have him burn me a few CDs of the unreleased, demo, etc stuff. If they do another box set, they should make it 100% unreleased, demo, etc stuff and not make us hear (songs) like ""uh! all night"" and ""hell or high water"" when we didn't like it on the original CDs in the first place!!"
4,Kiss Box Set,"all in all, a long awaited, strong premier box set, covers the group's early tunes through the current ones. major oversights include omiting classics like : Mainline,Plaster Caster,Flaming Youth,Ladies Room,Baby Driver . how these 5 powerhouse songs were not included is totally ridiculous."
4,For Old Time's Sake...,"Before you get sick of all ... reviews this release garnered, understand one thing; you can't please everybody.The packaging is fine; the deluxe set packaging is superbly over-the-top and great for the die-hard Kiss fan, but the rest of us should be content with the regular one, because let's face it; the music should be the most important thing.All of KISS' musical eras are represented, and this box set is of more use to those looking for 'hits' as opposed to unreleased material. Bootleg-scavengers (I'm not one) will complain endlessly for the repetition and (let's face it) mediocre demos contained within, to say nothing of the quality demos and live tracks the band NEGLECTED to put on it.Five stars for overall presentation and posterity, three stars for the fifth disc (which is worth less than week-old bubble gum), which makes this a 4-star affair."
3,Very Uneven Listening....No Jewels In The Rough...,"The quality and overall flow of the first few discs renders many of the songs unlistenable. The Wicked Lester stuff is flat out bruatal. It appears very little thought was put into the contents of this set; so much for Kiss's dedication to the fans. As far as the last few discs...well if there ain't no Ace, ther ain't no Kiss. For the Kiss novice, My advice is to purchase the Kiss remasters starting with the first album and ending with Dynasty in one huge & swift super-saver purchase. If you are flat out, die-hard, Gene can do no wrong Kiss fan, then this box maybe inches towards 4 stars. Overall, a purchase to be made by Kiss Army members only."
4,Wheres the 6th disc?,"Ok I love KISS I got almost every Cd they ever put out I found this Box set to be good altho missing some stuff they have all these demos and un released stuff in there vaults why didn't they just clean some more of them out? and put them on a sixth disc of better yet do what they did for the ""Hot in the shade"" album just take some demos clean em up and put em on a album oh well all in all buy the box set its still worth your money even tho only a handful of unreleased stuff is here only like 20 I think but its good there the early version of ""God Of Thunder"" sung by Paul or the early version of ""Little Ceaser"" Sung by Eric They need a new Box Set or a disc of Unrelased Demos and B-sides now that would be something that all KISS fans will love"
2,Don't bother reading if you are under 30,"This book is for old folks who don't really know what's going on and will believe almost anything in a desperate last grasp for marketing relevance. If you are a young, vibrant marketer, leave this book on the shelf - you will be better off harnessing your own originality."
2,Disappointed,These ring guards are the same as the large guards that I received. They are still too big for my ring. Another waste of money. VERY disappointed.
3,Good for beginners,"I got myself this book by reading reviews. I should admit that it did have real good stuff for beginners although I did not find what I wanted. I was looking more of teaching how to do math when it comes to compound dilution from a stock concentration to a final concentration. Example, stockin mM to fianl of uM or nM in a well (96 well). I wanted to learn how to claculate the working concentration etc. How much volume to add and how to maintain the same concentration of DMSO till the end and stuffs like that. I wanted to learn some basics of qPCR calculation."
5,An Easy Read - I couldn't put it down,This is the only time I have received a book as a gift that I actually liked. Someone gave me a copy at work. I LOVE IT. Now I am going to give it to my sister to read.
5,Highest Quality,I have read it twice.Both humorous and substantive. One part is about the Hoffman's bittersweet story of infertility treatments that result in an adoption - a tale that is both funny and encouraging. It is very easy reading and I recommend it to everyone.

3,Tweed and Katt Sizzle in a hot thriller,"Last Call Colour 1990 Erotic - Thriller Shannon Tweed, William Katt Rated : Unrated Version Reviwed This steamy thriller has plenty of love scenes to keep you satisfied and entertained. When a deal goes sour the real fun begins as the lovers play a twisted game of revenge. Review : *** Out Of 5"
3,Not Bad For A Friday Movie At Home,"This movie was entertaining sort of soft porn with a plot. Two partners set out to recover money that they lost in a crooked real estate deal. Things lead to murder,romancel and sweet revenge against the crooks."
1,Fiction not history,"The author's usage of demeaning terminology in reference to anyone associated with Castro converts what could have been an informative book into emotional anti-Castro propaganda.Worse than that, he presents scenarios that are not credible along with sloppy research. One example of the latter is his description of a DRE-credited shooting raid on the ""Hotel Blanquita"" on August 24, 1962. The Hotel was called Rosita de Hornedo (9 rooms were hit with machine guns and a small cannon). It is next to the Blanquita Theater. (Both structures have since been renamed).There are better alternatives in this genre."
1,This could be a scam,I ordered this juggling club thinking it was a set of 3 or 4 based on the picture and write-up. It turned out to be 1. The manufacturer called me about the order before it shipped and asked me to upgrade the order to 3. I did it because they were for my grand-kids. I believe I could have gotten a better deal on a set of 3 somewhere else. Who would sell a set of 1 juggling club?
3,Anthony Wong attacks!!!,"If you're a fan of Ebola Syndrome and The Untold Story, and havent seen this yet,then yes this will be worth a look. I didnt find this one as over-the-top or quite as entertaining as the other two,though.The pacing was a little slow between the more gruesome bits, and the less said about the weak attempts at humor, the better. Still, its worth watching if you're a fan of Anthony Wong. And who in their right mind isnt?!?"
4,T-Rex Puppet,My son loves this dinosaur puppet. It is big & you can control the head & the tail. He plays with it a lot. We have this one and another kind of dinosaur & they are both fun. The only problem is that they aren't the best of quality. We have had to stitch them already. Luckily they tend to let loose at the seams.
4,A Little Scary,"I got this for my 2 year old nephew who really loves dinosaurs. His mother and I love it, however, he finds it pretty scary. I think he will eventually like it a lot, but perhaps it would be better suited for a slightly older child."
2,Look elsewhere!!!,"I would look elsewhere if you are trying to find an entry level LCD. The picture color quality on this set was never accurate, especially in HD. CNet's review on this product confirms that this is a problem with this set. My set had a wiring problem several months in and after that steadily went downhill. I've since moved on and I would suggest you carefully weigh your options before pulling the trigger on this t.v."
3,More of the same,"I've been a fan of Dame Joan for many years. I've met her several times and received mail from Switzerland. I have almost everything that she has recorded on video and audio. I felt it was not long enough (59 min.). I was hoping to see or hear something new. If you don't have any DVDs of Dame Joan I feel you will enjoy it, but someone like myself it's not what I was looking forward to."
1,Bought as a replacement for our snuza,"I got this as a backup/replacement for our snuza, the original battery that came with the snuza lasted about 9 months, this replacement lasted 3 weeks ( and really was starting to fail after 10-14 days.) I'd avoid it as a replacement for a Snuza."
1,Dead batteries,"I purchased two of these batteries for our baby's Snuza monitor. Both were dead when we got them. They even say on the side ""use before July 2012"" It is now December 2012, so the company should have known better than to ship then out."
1,Battery died almost immediately.,Battery barely lasted a week. It was for a baby monitor. I was very disappointed. The original battery lasted much much longer.
2,battery half-dead,"When I put the battery in the product that needed a battery, the battery light indicated that the battery was half dead. Initially, I thought perhaps the battery indicator just wasn't working correctly since it was the first time I replaced the battery. However, after having the battery in the product for a year, just using it a few times, the battery is completely dead. The first battery lasted three years and I used it more often. Interesting enough, it is the exact brand of the battery that came with my product, my thoughts on it would be that the company sent me an old battery."
1,Buyer beware,"I was shipped a TL-5151 which is not the same battery. Many people think because a battery is the same size that it is electrically equivalent. That couldn't be further from the truth. These two batteries are definitely NOT equivalent. The TL-5902 is designed to be able to provide high energy for short duration. The TL-5151 is designed to be able to provide low energy for a long duration. Unless these guys have changed their practices about shipping ""substitutes"", you may wind up wasting your time and have to send it back like I did."
1,Battery died within 3 weeks,"I bought this for the Snuza Halo device, a baby monitoring device and the device started beeping to alert me the battery was dead within 3 weeks. So I think the batteries amazon is selling have been sitting on the shelf for too long and are no good."
2,Died very fast,"I bought one of these for a SnuzaGo. The original battery that came with it lasted for over 3 months of use. I used my Snuza every night all night, as well as all of my daughter's naps. When I put in this battery, it lasted 6 days with the same use. I was very dissapointed, so I emailed their customer service. They sent me another free of charge. That one also lasted only about 6 or 7 days. I won't be buying another one of this brand.So full stars for customer service, but 0 stars for the product itself."
3,Quality a suspect,"The battery has fixed the problem with my Mac where the internal clock was losing time. But the quality of the battery is a bit suspect because I saw some corrosion on it. Unfortunately, I had to use it because my old battery was gone to the point that my machine was becoming unusable."
4,Didn't think these still existed.,"My Dad has an old MacIntosh computer (from around 1991). He ran into problems recently, and it appeared he had a dead battery (color modes lost, clock quit working, etc). I told him it would be nearly impossible to find such a battery, but I ran a search - - and to my amazement, there it was on amazon.com (and for 5 bucks). The battery is installed, and seems to be working. My Dad is good for another decade."
4,A classic mystery by one of the best 1990's practitioners.,"Jennifer Rowe is one of the top writers of classical mysteries of the 1990's . A firm grasp of plot, motivation, red herrings, twists, the detective who knows all, and, the favorite of most fans like myself (the least likely suspect device) are always a part of her books and conducted with sure mastery. This book delivers on all of them very satisfactorily and will not dissapoint. Alas, it is also an ultimately sad ouvre. As all of Rowe I have read, including the short stories, not to be missed."
1,Disappointing.,"Had high hopes on this product from reading other reviews on it. I had recently had a basement flood of 6 inches of water. After the water receeded, I needed to get rid of the remaining moisture. Did my research, order the product, got it and turned it on. 6 hours later, not a drop was in the catch basin. It was quiet, it had wheels, and was easy to operate, but it just didn't work. Gave it a two week trial, sent it back."
1,Failed at 17 months,Worked OK until at Month 17 the humidity control failed and dehumidification mode stayed on permanently. Stay away from Haier dehumidifiers.Before this I had a Soleus that also failed short of two years. I saw that Frigidaire has good reviews and ordered up one of them.
3,"Original and valuable, but it could have been taken further","I had expected a somewhat more detailed and in depth approach of the damage done to the soul and spirit of sexual abuse victims. Instead, the author focuses mainly on energetic approaches to heal the soul and describes the damage to the soul in those terms. Ofcourse it is hard to differentiate between soul, mind and feelings in conceptual terms yet I had hoped it would have done more so. A psychology of the soul beyond energetic terms would be very worthwhile. Nevertheless, I personally value any approach that attempts to dig deeper, beyond that which we already know, for which I applaud the author."
1,"Ugly, uncomfortable, and weak.",The leatherette is nothing like my black leather couch. The chair doesn't lean back far enough to be called a recliner. The leg rest doesn't support any weight. I'd suggest spending some extra money and getting a real recliner.
3,"decent chair, poor quality control","Chair arrived on time but was in need of repair. A screw had fallen out and could not be replaced because the threads were stripped. It should have not left the factory in that condition. How embarassing because this was a gift. Thank goodness my husband is quite handy and was able to finally fix it. If I order from Amazon in the future, I will be sure the product does NOT come from Coaster Furniture."
3,Good value,"It looks good and feels comfortable. It'd love some additional features, but didn't want to pay more - so am very satisfied."
5,How sweet the sound,"I thought I was the only one who thought that U2 had been unfairly treated by the mainstream Christian Press. At last we now have a studied and sympathetic analysis of their faith and their struggles.Steve Stockman takes us on their journey from The Shalom Fellowship and near abandonment of their musical lives to meetings with the Pope, World Leaders and the magnificent All That you Can't Leave Behind. We see U2 as artists who have taken their faith and doubts where few other Christians could have dreamt. Why is it that they would have more been accepted if they had performed overtly christian material to entertain exclusively christian audiences? For the answer you should read this book.It is not a complete biography. It doesn't pretend to be. But it does give a real insight into the World's Greatest and probably least understood band."
3,george,"The book was ok, but it was only based on opinions buy the author. I don't beleive that u2 had anything even to do with this book. I was just looking for something direct to come out of the group members mouth.. but that was not the case"
2,A disappointment...,"Though I am a huge U2 fan, I was disappointed by this book. It is clear that it is written from a very ambiguous 'post-modern' Christian viewpoint, and this is echoed on every page of the book. The author's agenda of reframing Christianity in the 'po-mo' world is so obvious and incessant that it ruined all the other aspects of the book.To end in a cliche way, ""I still haven't found what I am looking for""."
2,The upsurge of prophetic substance.,The charismatic pentecostalism of joy which permeates their spiritual members drives one into the heart of Dake and the baptism of the holy spirit with the evidence of speaking in other tongues. The revelation of Dake's spiritual discipleship through the giving of the STUDY BIBLE gives one food for spiritual digestion and milk of nursing. Often times depth results and the Rev. Finis Jennings Dake raises someone to experientialism.
1,A Mockery of Christianity,"In short, this book feebly attempts to link a secular pop group with Bible Christianity - and fails. The questions remain, why does Bono run around dressed up as Satan? Is a rock star lifestyle compatible with the teachings of Christ? The book sets out to answer these and other anomalies in the theory, but really creates more questions than it deals with. The writing style is mediocre to poor and in no way justifies the purchase price even when obtained from bargain on-line dealerships such as this one. The bible states ""Let him that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity"" and yet Stockman eulogises men whose lifestyles embody fleshly perversion, amd the denial of Christ's claims. May I instead recommend you purchase a bible and read that for that is what testifies of Christ (John 5:39)"
2,Doesn't measure up...,"I've read several of Campbell's novels-since he is my favorite horror author-but this one doesn't measure up. Mostly boring, it lacks a lot of the creativity, suspense and uniqueness that many of his other novels contain(especially the older ones). The novel does contain some of the vintage Campbell ""creepiness"" which he is able to convey without actually coming out and saying it. He lets the reader's mind fill in the gaps--sort of like Hitchcock. This novel, for me, never gains much traction for it to be enjoyable and worth reading. But, I certainly won't give up on him as a horror author, as his other titles: Nameless, The Count of Eleven, and The Face That Must Die, were enjoyable finds."
5,Love this watch!!,"I've had this watch before. After 5 years, in the ocean nearly everyday, it finally gave out. I thought I wouldn't find it again. This color and style. I love it because it's comfortable to wear when surfing and/or paddling. I am a hairstylist and it looks great even at work when I am shampooing client, etc. My eyes aren't as sharp as when I was younger, so the digital numbers make it super easy to see. A very good practical and fashionable watch. RECOMMENDED HIGHLY!!"
5,Fantastic Watch,"I am a proud owner of two G Shock watches already. I love the watches I have, so I bought my wife one. She loves the all black Baby G Shock watch I bought her. Her watch does not have the atomic time keeping or the solar power like the g shocks I have. She is not into all the different gadgets like me. She just wanted somethig simple and durable. This is the perfect watch for everyday activities."
2,Uncomfortable and doesn't maintain settings,"I've owned several watches and this is by far the worst. I've had the watch for 3 weeks now and have had to re-set it four times. For some reason the time and date keep re-setting (and not it's not because the time zone is shifting). The instructions are confusing as to how to get to a mode because the pictures in the manual aren't clear. Maybe I got a watch made on an ""off"" day. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands (no pun intended) to figure out how to keep and maintain the time on this thing, I recommend another watch. One other thing---I have fairly small wrists. This watch is quite large and clunky if you have small wrists.I gave this watch 2 stars instead of 1 because the watch face seems very durable."
5,Ahhhhhhhhhhh Smallwood again JUST BLESSES MY SPIRIT!,"What can anyone way about Richard Smallwood? Is there an adjective for his music? I don't think so, so I'll just use the tried and true word, AWESOME, POWERFUL, MASTERFUL!I think Richard Smallwood could sing falalalalala to me and I'd be happy and he could play the scale and I'd jump for joy! I wish he would just drive up to my door with Visions and just sing for me until I was exhausted. I am so pleased with my purchase and overjoyed with his music!"
2,Bad seller / good product,"On their Amazon Marketplace, they claimed their product was ""in stock"". Within a day or 2 of my order, I received the automated shipping message from the seller via Amazon stating the product was shipped. I then received a separate email from the seller stating that the product was out of stock and I had the option of canceling the order or waiting. I chose to wait but I questioned why they would send a shipment notification via Amazon and their misleading ""in stock"" status... Which had not changed on their Amazon Marketplace page. They never responded. Several weeks later, the product arrived.So final thought: Shady business practices, but good/standard factory product."
2,cute but flimsy,"I bought two of these watches in different prints. They are adorable and the time-teaching feature seems like a good idea. I can't say for sure because hardware on both watch bands were broken within two days. Two different children...one who does not play roughly and one who likes to run around a lot and play outside. They were lightweight which the boys liked very much because they were comfortable, but not very durable."
5,access point protector,"I used the ""clock guard"" to protect an access point that I had palced in the gym. It works freat"
5,These are not stories or legends - they are the words of our people.,"As a child, Uncle Simon would sit at the table or fire with the elders, his parents and grandparents listening, learning and absorbing the truths of our people as told by them. These are truths in a long forgotten lifestyle of days gone past. You may Google his name and order directly from him instead of paying inflated rates from sellers as new books. If your lucky, you might get a signiture. Dont forget to sent tobacco as an offering.kokopelli"
3,Still Pondering?,"Putting aside the close mindedness of other reviewers, I thought this album was a pretty good effort from 2NU, while it doesn't quite measure up to the genius that shone out of Ponderous.It is fairly similar in format to 'Ponderous', with the spoken word overlaid with music and interspersed with songs, however the wit and weird-ism seems somewhat lacking here.Far from being a trash album, I found it quite harmless and enjoyable overall and I am quite happy to add it to my vast collection.If you liked Ponderous then you will like this too."
1,This just isn't very good,"Overproduced new agey synth-pop, tons of spoken word, and some prepubescent female vocals that will make you think twice about letting anyone know you own this record. Lots of surrealist lyrics, mostly incipid and cheesy, but at times amusing, in part thanks to the sound effects accompanying the spoken word. I guess some people find this soothing."
1,Just not the same,"Just not the same. WARNING, WARNING! The original dubbing was much better and more comical! The least U.S. Manga could've and should've done was given you the option to view both versions in a one or two disc set. The fun and thrills were gone for me. They blew it on this one. If you liked the original don't waste your time. Throw this one to the boneyard."
1,This was horrible,This Video was the worst anime I have ever seen.I wonder if it could have been improved if it had been done as a series That way they would not have had to skip the missing story line charcters and the fact that everyone dies.Stupid Stupid Stupid!!!!!!!YUK
5,Smoking hot jazz and jive... great Stuff!,"This is an outstanding collection of vintage recordings from jazz violinist Stuff Smith, jamming along with top-flight jazzmen such as Jonah Jones, Cozy Cole, Erroll Garner and others. A killer mix of trad-jazz and swing, with lively vocals and dazzling musicianship. Really, really fun. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Music Guide)"
3,Great voice,"I heard ""Ain't No Reason"" used in the TV show HOUSE and knew I had to buy the cd. His voice is fantastically soothing - definitely akin to Tracy Chapman. While ""Ain't No Reason"" is in continuous play on my ipod, the other songs haven't really gripped me yet. I think it's a good cd, but perhaps one that will take me a while to really get into."
3,Sophmore blues?,"I think Brett is an up and coming force in jazz, and indie rock. His smooth sweet jams are so melodical and very thoughtful for such a young hippy. I just felt his first album was amazing, GET IT! You will be blown away, this was good but no explosion. Round three will be the test. Better than alot, but...I wanted so much more!"
4,Ain't No Reason,"I can't really comment on the whole c.d., as I've only heard one song. I heard it on House, the television show, on an episode entitled ""Family"". It of course was ""Ain't No Reason"". I had to look up the lyrics again, just to make sure I heard them right, but I had. It evoked instant emotion in me, bringing tears to my eyes. It tied in beautifully with what the episode was about, and brought to my mind some issues that had been going on in my life. I found it haunting, sad, yet tinged with hope. I came here to see what others thought, and after reading the mixed reviews I still am not certain whether to purchase it or not. But I had to say that I did love that one song, and I have rated it with 4 stars. I love good lyrics, and it had them."
5,Missing great(!) bonus tracks,"I can't stop listening to this album! On first listening, one or two cuts stand out; on repeated plays, that quality that makes you want to listen repeatedly shows itself on every track. With apologies to Amazon, do yourself a favor and download this album from iTunes where there are two ""bonus"" tracks (i.e., 12 tracks in all), both of which are really wonderful. One of these -- ""Fig Tree"" -- is, hands-down, the best of the entire album; what a shame it's not included on the CD."
4,Excellent,"This is terrific, low key, beautiful tunes. He sounds so much like Xavier Rudd (and maybe a bit like Paul Simon). In fact, I think that if you made a mix of Dennen and Rudd, people would think it was the same artist. If you like this, check out Rudd."
1,Redundant!,"Originally, I heard the song ""Ain't No Reason"" and was impressed with Dennen's vocals and unique tone. However, upon listening to this cd, I realize why he has not made more success as an artist. Each song on the album is almost identical to the next. His range is seemingly limited as is his instrumental ability."
3,Deja Vu,"Is Mr Dennen paying royalties to Bob Dylan for his reworking of""I Want You"" into ""She's Mine.""?"
2,Slightly shallow,I had high hopes for this new artist but found his lyrics slightly childish and shallow. His voice is also more feminine than I enjoy. Overall it's not a bad recording but probably just not my style.
5,Another great album!,"Brett's style is so different, it's like a modern day Bob Dylan. Easy to listen to and the words are sometimes quite profound. He is a talent!"
1,and Narcissistic Therapists Are Still Whining,"I expected so much more from this book. Rather than taking a serious look at the some of the shortfalls of psychotherapy, these two guys whine on and on about why therapy won't remove their guilt of having affairs and continuing other self-destructive issues. And then they blame it all on Puritanism!Darn! I would really like to throttle my next-door neighbor and his noisy kids if it wasn't for that pesky Puritanism! Puerile self-justification. This book was a huge disappointment."
3,Two guys in a bar get drunk and ...,"The concept is good the presentation is terrible.Certainly questioning psychotherapy is reasonable. But here we are witnessing a brainstorming session before the crapola is clipped, resulting in a pseudo-intellectual, pompous assortment of oversaturated negative dialectic or in Hillman's own words, ""empty protest.""Yes, there are some intriguing thoughts and ideas but the complexity is ignored in favor of a shallow critical approach often given in a condescending manner."
1,Poor,"I was very disappointed in the pitiful booklet that I bought for $50! My word, it must be a RELIC!!!"
2,Not a good game,"This game didn't really have good, suspensful questions in it. The bizarre questions were really weird too. Almost every question was also easy to answer. I don't recommend this game, it's a waste of money..."
2,doesn't look like picture,Make sure to put drink holder in right spot. Doesn't hold a drink. Hard to zip up once air in it. Should've got the hard foam one.
1,Floating Lounge Chair not worth 59.00,Overpriced for what you get. The material it is made from is durable. The seat sits you awkwardly and you have to deflate it in some areas to make it confortable. Overall my best advice is to try a different float.
3,no title,"Great float, good price and good value.for the price its as good and better than anything on the market.Id buy this again."
5,My husband loves it...,"My husband was looking for a heavy-duty float for the pool, and we finally decided on this one. He's a fairly big guy, and he didn't want any sort of narrow, plastic/vinyl float. This turned out to really exceed our expectations- it's a really sturdy, large, comfortable lounder for the pool. Covered in a nylon fabric, the float does not get burning hot or stick to the skin. The foot rest can be folded under the float so it becomes sort of an armchair in the pool (which I like).If you don't want anything disposable or easily damaged, this is your float."
3,Lost air from the first time we inflated it; sits upright,"I got this float for my husband for Father's Day. From the first time he inflated it, the largest section lost air and needed to be refilled again before the next use. He has to inflate it every time he uses it. Other than that, he likes it in general. He would prefer if it were reclined a bit, however. It is designed to have you sitting straight up, which is not how he prefers to float. I wish we had realized that when we purchased it since it's not designed for as relaxing a position as we had hoped. (The girl in the picture must be lifting her torso in some kind of fake pose! When I tried floating, my head was bent forward--definitely not able to lean back like hers.)"
1,Experienced floater - don't buy this one!,"If you are looking for quality, this is going to disappoint. The nylon is quite sturdy but the air bladders within seem low budget especially in the air valves. There are six to inflate which takes forever but it was probably cheaper to mfr this way. The tubular areas (footrest and neck) are so small that they deflate the second you pull the compressor out. The leg rest doesn't fold in so you are limited to one position. You are very upright the entire time. There are no handles except on the back so tying together with others or even off a raft is very hard. Only buy sportstuff supplies - We wore our old ones out, bought this one which is getting returned as soon as my new sportstuff floaties arrive."
2,Lasted 2 Days,"The outer nylon shell was so thin, the seams ripped open in 2 DAYS. The nylon could not be repaired, being so lightweight that there was nothing to sew together. Thats a shame, because the float had great promise. I would stay away from this unit."
1,Not nearly as good as others,"I've had several different pool lounges over the years and two years ago decided to try this one. We didn't like the fact that there are several different compartmnents that have to be blown up and then getting each individual piece back into the cover is not easy. They never fit quite right. AFter one summer of use, and storing in the shade when not in use, the fabric started fraying and some of the air compartments had to be patch. This just with one person using it maybe one day a week in our pool that we only use two months out of the year. I wouldn't recomment this because there are other products out there that are much easier to maintain and will last a lot longer."
1,Disappointed,"I liked this float for about a hour when the seams began coming apart. After one use, it became completely unusable."
3,Chair rest,It didn't live up to my expectations. It had too many compartments that were difficult to pump up. My husband finally got to enjoy it as long as the air lasted.
2,deflate float,hard to inflate with cup holder in the right spot. you unzip to inflate but you can't put too much air in it or you can't zipped it back up. after all that work both chairs i bought are leaking air. not happy
2,Disappointing,I purchased two of these and both deflated almost immediately. They are way too expensive not to stay inflated. I was very disappointed in this product.
1,Short life,Liked the product initially but tears in the fabric started in the first year and now in the second year it is coming apart all over and won't last the season...too expensive for this kind of quality....just fyi I am talking about VERY limited and light use...our pool season is 8 weeks wherein I may have used the float a half dozen times.
3,It works,Initially I found the chair to sit you too much upright. All you have to do is let some (maybe a lot) of air out. The only chamber that needs to be somewhat full is the main chamber that includes the arms. The chair is comfortable and keeps you mostly out of the water for someone weighing 220 lbs. A good product at a very reasonable price. Remember to not over inflate!
2,Disappointed with floating lounge chair,"I received the floating chair lounge and immediately inflated it on the same day. The main white plastic bag that is inflated is not attached to the outer blue nylon covering. It is difficult to get it lined up properly. I cannot get the cup holder on the exterior liner to line up properly with the inner inflatable bag - so the cup holder is useless. The right arm of the floating arm chair is twisted down, probably as a result of improper assembly. A stitch at the back of the chair has already failed - approximately 20 centimeters in length. It is not designed for laying down as the picture on Amazons' website would make you think; it's only for sitting upright."
1,Awful,"The inner tubes were full of wholes which I tried to patch with duct tape. I finally gave up. Reviewing return policy, it states, product must be in original conditon. I amvery disappointed. Perhaps it was old stock. This is truly an inferior product."
3,Ok,"This was ok for a few months, but then got a hole somewhere in it. It was almost impossible to repair. Better off with the foam type unsinkable rafts."
4,This stuff works,I did two cars with the bottle that came in the kit with the UV light. I ordered more so I will have it when I need it.
5,A new Story Teller is Born,"A friend of mine once asked my why I read so many novels. Angell's novel bears out my answer,""to find a good one"". In ""Where Somebody Waits or Me"", Angell emerges as on of today's classic story tellers. He redefines the phrase, ""a picture is worth a thousand words"", by painting such a vivid picture of his characters, their feeling and emotions and the troubled times from the Civil War through the great depresssion, with so few strokes of his pen.He engulfs you with such ease, putting the reader in the story rather than on the outside looking in. The ponient ending only leaves you with a thirst for his next novel."
1,Don't do it,"I rented this from netflicks and it was back in the mail 2 hrs later. I would not get this unless you have to have everything that ""Danzig"" put out."
3,If Glen Danzig reads this:,"And I have a feeling that he will: because I hear that he reads his reviews on amazon from his fans - He and You Glen Danzig need to release a full concert DVD live of your material and quit repeating yourself, that means that you need to not have any repeats of the materials that are released because I've seen how big physically you are and I know that I wouldn't want to mess with you. I'd love to meet you in person but the chances of that are slim. You look like a wrestler and your arms are like tree trunks. Incredible!!!"
2,Polemic,"One of a hoard of post-modern/new historicist interpretations of Renaissance literature with a cultural and political axe to grind. It has some historical interest in that it focuses on sexual realities that were traditionally shunned. That said, it wrenches the sense of works in order to serve its own ends.Gregory T. Lombardo MD, PhD"
2,Mis animales,"Los animales que aparecen son muy pocos y los más conocidos, como el gato, perro, caballo, etc. Esta demasiado aburrido para niños de 1-2 años.El libro en sí, es de láminas gruesas y duraderas."
1,Designed to destroy Fulcanelli,"Do you ever read a book and feel like you need a long, hot shower when you're done? That is how I felt after finishing the original French version of this book. Dubois tries to make the case that Fulcanelli didn't really exist, that he was a ""committee"". The point of such an argument is to destroy the reality of the adept and give the credit for his work to Schwaller. Dubois takes great pleasure in the character assassinations of Jean-Julien Champagne and Eugène Canseliet.Moreover the book is poorly written and goes off on tangents that have nothing to do with her ""argument"".If you can read French, you will learn much more about the man known as Fulcanelli reading Patrick Rivière's book Fulcanelli in the Qui suis-je? series published by Pardès."
4,fulcanelli and alchemical revival,The book (at least the translation) is written in a haphazzard way. Although the material is interesting.
5,A must for those who intend on recieving some light,"I haven't read this book yet, but i know i'll be satisfied with what lies within! I shall hope any person in their open mind would appreciate such a topic, on Fulcanelli, what could be more intriging?"
4,Unbelievable Insight,"I couldn't put this book down once I received it. The stories that Mark tells give a much deeper understanding to the lyrics you find in all the Stavesacre songs. There were many times that I went back and listened to songs that I originally thought were just ""stories"" only to find that these were Mark's struggles.I met Mark once in 1997 and I definitely knew he was an intense person. Reading this book will give you insight into that intensity, faith and drive that flows out of every song. As a fan, reading this was like one ""aha!"" moment after another..."
2,"Ok, but certainly not great.","As a huge fan of The Crucified (Mark's first main band)- especiallyThe Pillars of Humanity, I really wanted to enjoy reading this book. There were a number of times that I was truly gripped and I found myself wanting to read more, but the overall 'attitude' and cynicism always finally made me put the book down. I don't believe that there was one mention of Crucified that was not in a negative/ dismissive context, yet even all of the 'failings' of Stavesacre (Mark's current band) are written in a positive light - or Mark would finally reveal that 'it wasn't their fault anyway'. An example of this is the 'crazed pastor' of the conservative church at the start of the book. I found myself asking 'If he didn't want to preach at a church, why would you take the gig there in the first place?'I just found the writing on the whole to be quite tactless and extremely biased even though there were some interesting stories."
4,"Good, but not what I'd expected...","First, let me say that I love relevant and the books they produce. I was looking forward to reading this book primarily to understand the philosophy of being a christian performing artist. The book touches on how and why the author leaves ""christian music"", but most of the book is a personal memior on the life of a independent punk rock band. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book, but don't expect much on the philosophy and thoughts behind leaving Christian music. Read it for the first hand accounts of playing in the indy scene and of tales of life from the road. Perhaps knowing of or having heard the author before reading would put much of the book in perspective.But at the least you should pick up this book for the first chapter and the hilarious story there. I can't think of another book that made me laugh out loud enough to almost wet myself.In the end, definately read it if you're a fan or want to know about life on the road. Just don't expect anything else."
3,THREW ME...,"This video really threw me...I sat and watched it with my nine year old son who loves rodeo. We were swaying with the music and the twists of the bulls.This video entertains you with some clips of youngsters riding steer, a bit of bull and rider history, and some real swinging rides. The narrating is done by a professional announcer and a stock breeder. They give you some extra insight on the bulls and the riders.The main thing that threw me was that it all ended so soon. I was pumped up and strapped in for more...but when a good ride lasts for eight seconds it would take quite a few rides to make a full length feature film.This is not a full length type film, but it is very informative and entertaining, you can witness the PERFECT RIDE..."
4,Cute outfit,"This is pretty cute. The little booties are leprechaun shoes and they are adorable. Had some problems with getting them though. The retailer did not include them with my order and I had to call and have them re-shipped, which took an additional week."
4,Handy gadget,This remote is small and easily carriable. It functions smoothly. It does exactly as it is advertised.
2,No Autofocus,"It is ok for studio type work, I find it anoying bacause of the inability to autofocus and as someone commented before... it defeats the purpose of having it, if you have to go back and manually focus the camera. It would be awesome if it did autofocus."
4,Very small but works great so far,I have only used it once and sent one to a friend (the price was really good). I have had other remotes for other cameras and was surprised how small this one is.
2,"Use some common sense, please!","To engineer a remote that is SO small, with no way of attaching it to anything, as not to lose it, is short-sighted and inane. To further add to the annoyance, one cannot, according to the instructions, replace the battery, but, must return it to the manufacturer. Please!"
3,Just a Shutter Release,"I ordered to use with my K20D. Yes it works to snap a shot, but doesn't focus or work in bulb. It would have been nice to know this before buying, but with very limited info on Pentax's site you can't find that out with out extensive research, or other people's reviews here. I think I'll get the corded release later to handle the AF and bulb functions. I guess if you were setting up a shot of the family or friends and pre-focused it would work very well."
1,Very short range,"I was disappointed with the short range of the remote, not the 15 feet advertised, but more like 3 feet. It comes with no instructions."
2,2 stars,"So here is the deal.1-It is tiny.. it comes in a box the size of a AA battery2-It has about a 7-8 foot radius at best if you want it to work guaranteed every time that you push the button. From 8 to 15 feet you have to be pointing it on a perfect line to the camera to get it to shoot and even then it only works about 25-50% of the button pushes.3-IMO 20 bucks is too much for this thing, BUT I don't know if there are many better options for Pentax anyways. This item should sell for about 5 bucks.4-If there was another remote that would give me a bit more range I'd be much happier with that5-If your going to be taking all your pics via remote inside a 7-8 foot radius it will do its job and as long as you don't lose it I don't see why it would ever stop working."
4,Super Simple,"This is extremely simple, one button, no synching with your camera, no programming. Just put the camera in remote mode and hit the button. This comes with no instruction whatsoever, probably because it is so simple. Does what is is supposed to do."
3,"Pentax Remote nothing more than ""OK""","Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. I had a wired remote for another camera, and never had to guess whether or not it was working properly. I may very well look around for one, because this wireless remote only seems to work periodically. I'm using it with a Pentax K2000."
2,Small and doesnt focus,"The remote is decent, but I should have read more before ordering it. I would like to have the ability to focus, especially if I'm doing tripod work and the subject(s) are not stationery. This remote control is basically only a shutter release, with a slight delay and if your target moves out of focus, you end up with a blurry picture. Additionally, it's way too small. When I opened the box and saw how tiny this remote was, I was disappointed. This remote is good for remote shutter release, and that's about it, really a novelty. I wouldn't have bought it, had I known this up front. I need to pay closer attention to the reviews next time."
1,Would be nice if it worked,Would be nice if it worked. Tried everything my Pentax K-x manual indicated that I should do and still no action. Not impressed. Perhaps a two pound mason's hammer would do the trick.
3,work only intermittently,Mine worked only occasionally. The rubber button is awkward -- you don't know for sure if you have fully push the button enough. There is no led lighting up. Is the battery in my unit too low?
1,Never worked on S5i,"I was using an Optio S5i mounted on a tripod in my car to capture video from motorsports. I bought this remote control because I was tired of reaching back to turn it on / off. It never worked. I searched for solutions, and could never get it working. What more is there to say? Waste of money. Maybe I got a bad unit, but who cares? I bought a ContourHD with a window mount instead."
4,Works fine but...,You have to be in front of the camera for this thing to work..kinda a pain but it at least keeps the camera from shaking when it's on the tripod.
4,Remote Control F for pentex slr camera,The only problem I have with this product is it is very small and you have to be very careful not to loose it.Other wise it works great no more rushing to get into the pic once i focus the picture setting.
3,Repair for Formica Chip,"I repaired a small chip in a formica table top and it did an OK job. You need to have an eye for mixing the colors to blend in with the material you're trying to repair. Not sure how this product would work on larger areas. Color portions are small and there will probably be some colors you won't use. Be sure to cap partially used portions immediately, as it drys out. Overall, I'm satisfied with my small repair."
4,Quick fix,"This was a pretty good solution for a tough problem. I burnt a piece of my formica couter top, about the size of a dime, and it bubbled over and cracked away. Leaving a very unsightly spot. I bought this product and I was able to match it pretty well. U have to be a little 'OCD' to match it up right, but Im happy with the results...good luck! =)"
5,Works great if color can be matched.,"If you can match the color to what you want to repair this is an excellent product. It can save you replacing a kitchen counter, for example, if you can match the color. I found after using this product several times that one color container of the paint may not be enough to match the color. One you get a decent match, however, the product really is excellent."
3,OK,It worked and I was pleased. The paint was almost dried out but was able to make it work. I only needed to use it on one area so I was happy.
3,Poor durability,"The filler part of this kit works OK, but the color finish is basically a paint and rubs off. If it is wet when rubbed, it rubs off very easily. I would say it is not suitable for a kitchen counter top but would work for a Formica type surface elsewhere."
3,works for minor repairs deep scratches and chips,"This product takes a realistic understanding of what to expect from a product of this kind; (it is not a miracle kit designed to make your countertop look better than new). And, for best results, you need to mix a couple of small samples first (underline small, as there is not a lot of material in this kit) as the product's color, like paint, dries lighter than when first mixed.Don't expect perfection, and like a couple of other reviewers state, this is not really what you want for a shallow scratch or chip, because it will not be deep enough to hold or last. As long as you understand that by the time you are to the point of repairing your formica, laminate countertops, you are probably at the point where you should be looking and saving, and planning ahead for their replacement, funds permitting in the near future, you will be satisfied with your results."
3,Good idea for a product,"good idea for a product, but I am not artistic enough to get a good color match. Hard to find it in local stores."
4,cool music,"A nice album that contents different songs from various artists, some of them very classic but they will never get old. Includes one yannick's song in french. I strongly recommend this album."
3,Lower your expectations,"I thought it was too slobbery. Ed needed to tell more anecdotes (and more anecdotes we didn't already know).Ed even messes up a few stories that somehow I knew better than him.Because it's about Johnny, the book is worth a one or two-night read.But I was hoping for some groundbreaking stuff. Things I never knew about Johnny Carson. And, yes, we GET it, Ed. You really really really loved the guy. Next!"
2,Felt like a ghost-written story.,"I was disappointed in this book, having been a big Carson fan when Johnny had the helm of the Tonight Show. This book really sounded like Ed had some steak and margaritas with a hack writer and gave him a cut of the profits to put his stories together into a book. I give the two stars for Ed's stated affection for Johnny, and he has a couple of good stories to tell, but he repeats himself quite a bit and after a few chapters I found myself saying ""OK Ed, give me some substance"". Just a light piece of drivel I wished I didn't waste my time on."
2,Jumped Backwards and Forwards... All Around.....,"I loved Johnny Carson, as did everyone. I have nothing against Ed McMahon and thought he was wonderful on the Tonight Show. But, this book was a big let down for me.First of all, it didn't stay on track, it kept jumping from one year to the next, then back again, then an entire decade and back! It was confusing and sad at the same time. It's like Ed McMahon couldn't wait to make a little money off of his good friend. I hope that wasn't the case.Also, I felt he was tooting his own horn all through the book. Another sad point.Well, I would check it out of the library if you want to read it."
3,Could Have Been So Much Better,"I really enjoyed this book, but it could have been much better. I had no idea that Johnny and Ed were such good friends and went out to eat and DRINK after most of the shows. But all of the gags and interviews mentioned in the book, I already had seen and heard, so really there wasn't much new to read about. Still a fun look back at probably one of the greatest entertainers of all time. RIP, Johnny."
2,Johnny Carson was one of a kind.......,"I did not enjoy reading this book because Ed McMahon is no writer! He is probably a very nice guy but the book was boring. It was an homage to Johnny, as well it should be, but the stories were ones I've heard repeated on television or in interviews. No unusual insight or stories I thought I was going to hear upon buying the book."
1,Buy the DVD Instead!,"Ed McMahon is a wonderful talent, just ask him. Don't waste your time with this book. When Ed isn't talking about himself, he relates (verbatim) scenes from the Tonight Show that you can watch and enjoy on the DVD."
2,Waste of paper,"For decades the author was the designated sycophant on the Tonight Show, laughing even when Johnny Carson wasn't funny, accepting every insult Carson handed out and agreeing to anything Carson said. Now Ed McMahon reprises the fawning role in book form.On virtually every page he informs the reader that Carson was witty, smart, generous and other encomia. He repeats verbatim amusing incidents that are all on the ads for Tonight Show DVDs: e.g., the potato chip collector, the cute kids, Dolly Parton's notable physique, etc. There is very little that regular viewers of the program don't already know. We know nothing significant and new about Carson. Oh, he was a very private person--a secret already known by millions.The book left me with a sour taste for McMahon, the huckster, the magazine salesman, the talent scout pretender. And I wasn't amused by the stale anecdotes regarding Johnny Carson."
2,Thank god it was on sale!,"A lifelong Carson fan, and lover of the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, I was delighted to find a copy of this audio book at Tuesday Mornings for just $3.99! WOW! About 10 minutes into the book, and I knew that $3.99 was just about what this book was worth.Ed McMahon is no writer - that's quite obvious right off. You'd think that his ghost writer, or editor would have been able to give him some help with this project. He rambled on, and skipped back and forth so much that I often thought I had mixed up the CDs. I agree with all the viewers who mentioned the fact that he offered very little new information. Mostly, it was as though he were just re-telling the various great moments of the Johnny Carson Show as just seen on DVD.I was fortunate enough to be in the live audience twice and witness Mr Carson in action. He will surely be missed by millions of people for years to come."
3,Carson's career is reduced to a series of disjointed snippets,"Unlike so many show business collaborations that exist only when the public is watching, the relationship between Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon was a genuine friendship. While McMahon understates what he did for Carson in this book, other sources have stated that he many times kept Carson from making a fool of himself when drinking or even getting physically beat up. With such a close collaboration of 46 years, there is a great deal of material with which to write a book of reminiscences.The problem with this book is that it has the structure of one rushed into print immediately after Johnny's death. There is a movement from anecdote to anecdote as if McMahan was brought in and simply free-associated in a random memory purge. Johnny Carson was an extremely talented entertainer and one of the most interesting people, yet in this book his career is reduced to a series of disjointed snippets."
3,"Not a bad read, not a great one either.....","I think this book is well written, but I really didn't come away with knowing more than I did about Mr. Carson, or Ed McMahon. This book would be great for anyone who NEVER laid eyes on the Tonight Show before Jay Leno took over.This book would be great for reading between flights at LAX."
3,WHO! is this book about anyway?,"I didn't know who this book was about, was it about Johnny or was it about Ed? I would rather go with ""Here's Johnny"" by Stephen Cox. Alot more information relating to the show and Johnny."
2,A Bit on the Skinny Side,"McMahon tells a few war stories and portrays Carson as a genuinely decent person. I liked Carson, so that's reassuring. But too much of the book repeats you-had-to-be-there comedy sketches. And there is no rhyme or reason to the book's organization.Also, McMahon could have done some probing with Carson's friends and colleagues to try to get the root of this Star's iconic cool and reserve."
4,Too Short!,"Here's Johnny written by Ed McMahon is a testament to the long history the two men shared. I found the book to be fun to read, informative and especially heartfelt. I miss both Johnny and Ed and will always remember the Tonight Show as television at its very best!"
2,disappointing,"Ed should stick to being a second banana, he is not much of a writer. Nothing new in this book, I have heard all the stories at one time or another, no one will still know ""what Johnny Carson was really like"" from this book. I guess I was expecting too much. There are some funny stories, but truly, just repetition of what has been said before."
2,Disappointing for real fans.,"I couldn't wait for this book to come out. I pre-ordered it and waited. I was so disappointed to read it and find very little new information. Apparently Ed didn't know Johnny Carson any better than anyone else who's written a book about him. So much of what he wrote is in the DVD set that I felt like he must have just watched those in order to write the book. The rest has pretty much been covered in other books. There were a few things I didn't know, but if this book is his memories from 46 years, he sure doesn't have many memories that the rest of us who watched Johnny Carson on the Tonight Show don't have. I gave it two stars for anyone who hasn't watched the DVDs or read other books. Johnny was a class act who will never be matched; he deserved better."
2,"Loved Ed, but . . .",". . . he really can't write. Lots of repetition, overstatement, exaggeration. Not a good book at all; I couldn't finish it, and I finish everything."
1,Disappointed,"I have always loved Johnny Carson and was looking forward to learning more about him in this book, but unfortunately, Ed McMahon was not the man to tell it. Ed's manner of writing was exactly how he was on TV -- pretty boring and non-descript. He spends more time talking about himself and how valuable he was to Johnny's success (???) than giving behind the scenes glimpes of Johnny and his guests. A pretty boring read."
1,Not up to standard,"Ed McMahon needs to remain from behind a keyboard. He worked with a true comedy genius for years and years and wrote about none of this stuff. His book was boring and lacked insight into the man; Johnny Carson. Badly written, poorly organized and thoroughly boring. It was like watching dry paint dry again."
2,Here's Johnny,I bought this for my husband at his request and asked him what he thought. He said no flow to choppy and poorly writen.
4,chop keepers stop cross contamination,My new chop keepers solve a lot of problems in the kitchen. They keep juicy fruits and veggies from running all over the counter and can be bent to funnel the food into containers/pans. The different colors help when preparing large meals by preventing cross contamination.
4,Biography review,I am sort of Bias with this purchase (I like the entertainer) I sort of didn't have alot of information on this entertainer was curious to see if there was any unknown information that wasn't covered on the magazines from the store so I got the book to Learn more
2,HP 02 Ink Cartridges,"I ordered 3 ink cartridges through Amazon from a third party vendor (Infinite-Surplus). I have not yet tried any of the cartridges but the packaging leaves a lot to be desired and is not as represented in the photo. Rather than each cartrdige being shipped in a Hewlett Packard box as shown in the photo, the three were shipped in an envelope with only their inner packaging, as if they were broken out of the combo pack. On top of that, the packaging containing the magenta cartridge was open, which could indicate a returned cartridge or just poor packaging."
5,GREAT,"I WAS HESITANT AT FIRST ABOUT THIS VIDEO, BUT IT IS GREAT!I we use it when we travel. It has upbeat praise music that isn't outdated. I find myself looking forward to hearing the music. A GOOD BUY FOR ANY CHILD ANY AGE"
3,More excitement please!,"My son really didn't care about these DVD's. It's really easy going and relaxed sounding. My son likes more upbeat music. I wouldn't purchase these again. ""C-"" Like the songs though."
4,Good DVD,My 2 year old likes this one. She'd like it more if it had more pictures of babies and less of electronic shapes. The outdoor shots are nice and more mature than the first Praise Baby DVD we have. The songs are great and I like being able to change the voices or play without them. The Praise Baby DVD's are the most requested by my kid - even over other cartoons or puppet type DVD's.
5,An incredibly valuable source for fascinating choral music.,"This book gave me valuable information for research of my Master's Choral Recital. My theme was Latin American and Spanish music, and I found beautiful music in here. It's an exciting book."
2,Unsuitable replacement for 2005 Audi TT,"I purchased this filter because the Bosch Website listed it as the replacement for a 2005 Audi TT Quattro 1.8L. Size-wise it's spot on, but the OEM Audi filter has notches around it and pockets on the ends so that it mates with the part that holds the filter. So, I had to pull out the scissors and do some crafting, worried the entire time about cutting a hole into the filter. After some trial and error trimming, I managed to get the part in, and it's working fine. However, I expected a part that really would just slap right in; I plan on buying a genuine VW/Audi part next time around."
3,Guy-Lit,"A funny, interesting book, easy to read, well written, and entertaining. Would probably appeal more to someone in their late teens/early twenties, or anyone who likes Adam Sandler-type movies. Would like to read more by the talented David Israel-- Behind Everyman was great fun."
1,Like watching in fast forward mode,"I purchased this for my 15 month old daughter who has been really enthusiastically watching and learning Baby Babble and My Baby Can Talk dvds from age 7 months. From the positive reviews I expected this to be very good. If you like a much faster pace with loads of content, this is for you. My daughter lost interest very quickly. I managed to watch the entire dvd and throughout felt quite nauseas from watching the quick changing scenes. The effects of repeatedly ""flipping pages"" was in my opinion, the cause. To me, this production is like reading a book (without breathing) filled with pages of continuous black text, with little or no thought for layout. I would not recommend this to my friends but will recommend the SIGNING TIME series. It's content may not be as full as the Baby See N Sign but it is definitely a more effective way of teaching making learning easy and fun. Also, the technique, production quality, songs and relevance cannot be beaten."
5,For a child who knows about the bible and God,I purchased this book for my grand daughter but I am not going to give it to her. She is very bright and an outstanding student but without a knowledge of the bible and religion....this isn't for her. Way too deep.
5,"A Pleasantly Compact, Lightweight, and No-Frills Keyboard","I'm not a big fan of Dell, but I'll have to admit Dell's really hit a home run with this one. With its minimalist design, the Dell L100 USB Keyboard is unpretentious and exudes a trim and clean-cut aesthetic appeal - a welcome departure from what seems to the norm for most keyboards designs these days: keyboards that are oversized and crammed with superfluous functions that most people simply have little or no use for. It is ultra compact and lightweight and, more importantly, it works flawlessly. If you're looking for a no-frills keyboard, I think you'll be pretty happy with this one."
3,Not to bad but over priced,"Amazon is selling this for near 70 dollars and the sellers are selling it for 12.99 new which is what it's worth. Anyhow the keyboard itself is decent, I use them at work our our control system Precision 390 PC's running XP. It's a basic keyboard, no media keys or shortcut keys just aplain keyboard with a snazzy Dell logo. The keys are comfortable to use and are responcive, it has bright led's to display scroll lock, number lock etc and come with most Dell PC systems I have seen."
4,iNFORMATION ABOUT PRODUCT,"Info on Amazon site said this was a new keyboard, but there was no info about the product in the package such as the fuction of the buttons across the top, and the purpose of the 2 USB ports underneath the keyboard. I'd appreciate more info on this product please.PS I do like the product, but more info would be helpfulThank you"
3,Dell Keyboard,I ordered a Sk-8115 Black Dell keyboard. I did not receive what I ordered. The invoice that came with it says Sk-8118 but that is not what I received. The one I received has the numbers DS/N TH-05695W-37171-118-1208 D P/N 05695W. It does not have a model # on it. I am not too thrilled with my first purchase from Amazon.com.
1,Poor keyboard,"If you need to be on a keyboard all day, then you want to pass on this one. It has a cheap feel to it and the keys are positioned very close together on a cramped keyboard."
4,Good concept,I liked these boxes - they were not difficult to put together and the snaps seem to hold tight. These boxes have tremendously compressed the amount of storage space required for my CDs.
5,Very cool CD storage,"These are really neat. I bought 6, which just happens to be the number that fit in the display case they were shipped in. To assemble, just snap sides to the end flaps. The tops are already assembled. I used them all, but if I hadn't, each case tucks neatly into its top for flat storage. The best thing is that they store CDs with the name up so you can easily see what's in each box."
1,Underwhelmed,CD case holder fails because it is large enough to hold so many CD's that it gets too heavy! One hand is barely large enough to hold it and the weight is too great for even a relatively well-conditioned man. Another objection is that it needs a heavy elastic strap around it to ensure that the loose-fitting lid doesn't come off and allow its contents to spill out if it is tipped too far (because its heavy weight causes one to lose his grip!).
2,texas,I do not recommend this item. The jewel cases extend above the edge of the storage box which means the lid sits on the jewel cases instead of the box itself. This means if you are stacking boxes the jewel cases are supporting the weight instead of the storage box. I would recommend the double wide storage box instead. The double wide case sides are higher and the jewel cases do not extend beyond them.
2,Lid doesn't fit securely at all,"I purchased the Snap-N-Store CD Storage Box to organize all of the store-bought CD's I have accumulated over the years. Most of my CD's are in their original jewel cases. The assembly of this product was easy enough. After placing my CD's into the storage box, I found the lid would not fit securely. It merely balanced on top of the jewel cases. I think it may have been better if they made the sides of the box a little taller and the lid fit tighter. Also, the corner of the lid must have been smashed during shipment...I guess that's what you get for buying cardboard. It doesn't matter how you dress it up---it's still cardboard! I wouldn't recommend purchasing this product unless you want to store CD's in paper sleeves. Even then, the lid is not a tight fit but at least there is enough overhang for box to close properly."
4,Functional CD Storage,"This box quickly unfolds and quickly snaps together to hold about 30 CDs in their jewel cases. The lid is not secured to the box so it may not be ideal for moving. However, for keeping your collection clean and organized on a shelf or in a closet it is ideal."
4,Perfect,Ordered this product and got Snap n store instead so Im very happy sence I already have one of these and 4 of the double wide ones. Not sure if ideastream and snap n store are the same company or not. But only thing I dont like about these are the buttons holding it togeather so I super glue the buttons for added support.
2,inexpensive,"The Box looks nice but the design is really bad.The buttons don't clip properly, like they don't fit into one another. keep open up the sides because these inexpensive buttons don't hold together like they should. I would not recommend this product."
3,Ideastream CD box,"There inexpensive and look good. Be carefull not to pull it off the shelf just to have the front cover open on you! Also, these are for CDs in cd cases. They will NOT store a DVD case!"
3,Good concept and style,"I really like these, but I ordered 6 and 3 were damaged. The black coating was nicked on the edges and the cardboard was visible. I returned the 3 not asking for replacements. The three that were undamaged look great on the shelves and I really like them. These were shipped and received incredibly fast - as usual."
3,Not So Happy,I ordered 6 of the CD Storage Boxes (I knew about the product because I had ordered them before). 2 of the 6 were damaged upon receipt (obviously not done during shipping). I did not complain because the price if the product is not worth the effort.The product is just fine if it arrives undamaged.
4,worth the purchase,The storage boxes are great for holding cds. They are very easy to assemble. The only problem I seemed to have with them is if you have any cd's in different shaped cases the lid might not fit completely. Generally the storage boxes are great and do exacly what they are supposed to do.
2,A little tight,"I like the idea of these cases, but they are a bit tight. CD's in plastic cases just fit. If you have a cd box set that is a bit wider don't bother. I wish they were 1/4"" wider and 3/4"" taller."
5,Excellent product,"A very affordable and practical storage unit. I was able to store 250 CD's-DVD's in their paper sleeves. The unit was easy to assemble and ready to go in just a couple of minutes. I initially bought two, and have just ordered four more."
2,Beware: doesn't fit CDs or DVDs in sleeves,"While the specifications state the inside width as 5-1/8"" the actual dimension is 5"", too narrow for CD/DVD envelopes. I bought the boxes for that purpose and cannot use them. Jewel cases fit well, though a bit snug."
4,Fits the Bill,"I needed black storage containers to match the components of my home theatre system. I bought a new TV and stand that held all of my components. When I did that, I sold my old entertainment center which housed all of my CDs/DVDs. The storage boxes fit nicely onto my TV stand with my other components and they were priced right."
1,Do Not Purchase This Item!!!,"This product would be fantastic if the CD/DVD's would actually fit in them. You have to turn them sideways to fit, they do not fit the way they are shown in the photos. Totally disappointed, this item is virtually useless!"
3,a different use,I thought that I would have room to lput in a card index made for boxes like that the lid lifts. As it stands you would have to search to find anything. I find that these4 boxes are better for craft item or other things like that. for those things I would get more of these. They stack well.
1,Not as great as it looks online.,"I guess you get what you pay for. I, like many others who purchased this product, did so to consolidate my DVD collection.The boxes arrive flat, which means you have to snap them together in order to get that square box you need to store things. And, like others, the snaps do not always stay closed. It seems that the more you add to the box, the more it comes apart. (I ended up putting epoxy on the snaps to keep them closed.)The style of the box, looked good in the pictures. But in real life, they fell - well, the best way to put it would be - flat.I have since purchased a wooden box, to accommodate what I wanted to do; and now use this box as a catch all item.If you are looking to store DVDs, CDs, or anything else like that, spend your money wisely and get something that is much more sturdy."
4,nice,"Nice box, Lid fits properly and the dvd/cd's fit well in the box. It's made of a very hard cardboard and is very sturdy.I had bought 5 of these, on one the snaps did not line up on one corner, on another I couldn't get the snap to snap and on another 1 of the snaps was not rounded like the others.Other than that, they are nice boxes that will be perfect for dvd/cd storage."
3,not so sure....,"For the most part, if you have looked for CD storage units, this is what you might expect... except...The snaps don't hold nearly as well as they should.As at least one other reviewer stated, the lid sits on top of the CDs, not on the top edge of the of the box.This means that unless your box is full when you try to move it, it is somewhat unstable with the snaps coming undone. It also won't stack at a uniform height unless it is nearly full.If the box is full, it holds the snaps closed better, it will stack at uniform height, and the lid becomes stable.I bought a bunch of these thinking I would have an adaptable/expandable CD storage situation. I expected to NOT have full boxes. But I didn't know how unstable these boxes are for the use intended.Thus my 3 star rating."
3,3 OUT OF 4 AIN'T BAD,"I ordered 4, not expecting all to be usable and sure enough, all 4 snaps on one end of one box were too loose to support contents without popping open. I don't return things that cost this little, so it went into the trash. Consider ordering extras."
5,great product for price,"These cd boxes are great and so is the company. They arrived 2 days after I placed the order, I snapped them together, created labels, and have finally organized all my cds, which were in the cellar for over a year. The boxes look good and I like how the title edge of the cd is at the top, so you don't have to flip through to read the front. The lid rests on top but you can still stack them. I liked them so much, I am looking for the DVD boxes too. You can't beat it for this price."
4,Ideastream CD storage box,"Boxes are sturdy and easy to put together. I wish the lid fit a little more snugly and that the boxes came in other colors than black. So far, the best storage I've had for CDs."
1,Defective and mishapen,"First of all, the image is not representative because the snaps are in the inside of the box, not the outside as depicted. And there are not two snaps on each edge, but only one--thus 4 snaps for the entire box.After visiting the IdeaStream website and viewing their Snap-n-Store products, it is clear that these are either counterfeit or an outdated or discontinued model since their models are all like the image and not like the items received.Second, 3 out of the 5 boxes I ordered were DEFECTIVE. Two of them snapped together with little or no effort. The other 3 do not snap despite herculean efforts mostly because they do not line up at all. On one of the 3 defective boxes, the only one end that snaps together is left with an opening which is almost a half-inch narrower than the width of a CD, thus impossible to use for CD storage as purposed since it is incorrectly cut."
1,Covers are too wide,"The cover is too wide for the box.Guess that is why the price has been reduced.A shame really, with the exception of the ill-fitting cover it is a good looking sturdy storage solution for cds.Wished I had spotted the other negative review before ordering.I hate getting stuck."
1,snaps often don't work,"These boxes snap together and often the snaps don't work. I bought two CD boxes and 2 file boxes. 3 out of four didn't snap together correctly. I wrote the company and they replaced the items. Of the replacements, half didn't snap together. Save your money."
3,pretty good,I used these with the TIC outdoor amp (which ended up performing very poorly). The sounds is pretty good on them. They are able to get pretty loud even with a bad amp. Not a lot of bass but that is to be expected.The wiring for them is already attached and is a bit small. I think another reviewer upgraded the wiring and this might be a possibility for me in the future.They look great in the backyard in the garden and near the walking path.
4,Good speakers for the money,Ya I would like more bass or any bass but for the price you can't beat em. The alternative is to drop 150/speaker on rock speakers. I to have gotten many compliments on the sound. So to those not looking for state of the art sound you will be very happy with these. Only negative is the 18 gauge wire they come attached to. I had to cut it off near the based to attache 12 gauge which you then have to weatherproof since the speakers do not open up.
3,Outdoor Speakers,"Overall, I am pleased. At higher levels the sound is ok, not great, but you have to consider the price. However, at level I keep the sound for outisde enjoyment I am very pleased. Each speaker comes with 30ft of insulated wire for underground and the appearance of the speakers goes well in my beds that use pine straw as a ground cover."
1,Don't buy this float!!,"I ordered this float thinking it would be more durable than an ordinary vinyl float. It is durable, but it doesn't work. It's actually a float inside a loosely fitting cover. The cover makes it very difficult to reach the valves to blow up the float; once the pillow is blown up it's essentially impossible to reach the main float valve to add more air.The issue that makes the product unworkable is that after it sits in the pool for a while the cover fills with water. Although there are drain holes they don't work. It took two of us to drag the float out of the pool after its first use, because the cover was so weighted down with water. We're sending it back; suggest you never order it so you don't have to do the same."
1,Waste of money,"Please read all the one star reviews. They are all true. I have two of these loungers, new this spring. Difficult to inflate, but doable. Once inflated, they are very comfortable to lay on. Getting them out of the water is extremely difficult due to the amount of water that gets between the bladder and fabric covering, pretty much impossible for a smaller person. Another problem is that the buttons that hold the top and bottom side of the fabric to the bladder fall off, causing even more water to weigh the lounger down. All in all, very poor design and construction. Made in China."
4,Great on land and in the water,"I love these inflatables and use them mostly on land as they are so comfortable to lay on in the sun. So much more comfortable then a towel or pad. Gets you off the ground and out of the sand. From a durability standpoint, they could be better as the seams on the outer nylon tend to rip open but I am using them on the ground and they do get stepped on and abused somewhat. They are good for the water but water get stuck between the outer nylon jacket and the innner vinyl inflatable so you need to drag it out of the water and let the water pour out as you do. Some might consider this a pain. For the price a great buy and very comfortable."
4,Super-sized Floating Mattress,"Very durable and large in size. Would be GREAT to use when tent camping as a bed, since it has such a large pillow attached. Nice to float on in the pool, but water collects between the outter covering and the mattress. Very heavy and hard to remove from pool until the water drains out.We bought two and had to return one since it had a defect and would not stay inflated."
4,seem to be a size smaller,I love Lee jeans but the black ones or any that are colored seem to fit smaller than the original denim. I had to get a size larger than the blue ones. Lee Jeans are my favorite and they fit me better than any other jeans.
5,Gotta Love 'Em!,I have to disagree with the other reviewer...I bought several pairs of these jeans...I have a large 'rear end' and a bit of a tummy...and these jeans flatter and fit and make me feel very trim and slim! I'd buy as many of these as you can!
2,Not as good as other Lee Jeans for women,"A big disappointment. I bought three other kinds of Lee Jeans from Amazon previousely since last year. So far, I like ""Lee Jeans Women's Missy Mid Rise Bootcut Jean with Flap Pockets"" the most, it really slim me down. I had great confidence in Lee Jeans until I finally came across this one... Despite the quality of the fabrict is not as good as others, it's not flattering at all. I returned this one immediately and place order the one mentioned above again."
4,Good old school skate punk,"This collection brings back memories. Skating & listening to hardcore punk music like The Faction, Drunk Injuns & Misfits. Great selection of songs, especially ""Tongue Like A Battering Ram"". Takes me back to my misspent youth."
4,Quite contrary...,"With her constant medieval imagery, sound and lyrics, it seems that Ms. Charming Melodee, the heart-shape faced, sad-eyed Mary Timony was just plain born in the wrong century. (Not many girls in this generation are called 'Mary' either, but I digress.)'The Golden Dove' sounds more polished, refined and generally more upbeat than her previous solo CD, the rough-edged, melancholy 'Mountains'. The tracks 'Look A Ghost In The Eye' 'and Magic Power' possess ridiculously catchy choruses this time out, definitely a good thing.Plus, her wispy, slightly lispy vocals are more pronounced than on the Helium albums and EPs, where they were all but buried underneath the Hammond organs and crunching guitars.If The Magic City was Helium's best, the The Golden Dove is Timony's best solo effort thus far."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"The first time I'd ever been exposed to Mary Timony was when I saw her open for Sonic Youth this past summer. Her live show was amazing, so I picked up the CD right away. The CD proved disappointing after seeing her live, but it's not bad. If you ever get the chance to see her live, however, go -- she's wonderful."
5,Wonderful!,"Okay, so to be honest, I haven't done any of the exercises in this book, yet. Just reading the introduction made me feel so much more open about attempting watercolor and thinking that I would have fun doing it. Ann's approach is warm and inviting. She talks about playing and being non judgmental and cultivates that attitude in her teaching. It's interesting to note that this book is categorized as art/self help. She also writes about art as intuitive.I don't know, yet, if this book provides ""good"" instruction in the way people expect. But, it is an avenue to express your authenticity with watercolor in a non judgmental setting. That works for me!"
2,Okay for Flexible Basic Camera,"This camera is good for someone who wants a reasonably good point-and-shoot for a reasonable price. The zoom offers good flexibility, the focus system is good for basic center-focus shots, but not good for other types of photo composition. It EATS batteries, but so do a lot of other cameras with similar features. The multiple frame option is good, the macro setting is good too, but otherwise its basic."
1,Not for the math buff,"""The Fractal Experience"" is probably right on the money, for those looking for ""cool""! What you get are very good fractal images, morphing from one to another; along with music background. Very good, for those at that level. My interest go more to the math, history, and the fellow who pioneered the field (Benoit Mandelbrot); along with demo images. If that's what you want, look elsewhere!"
3,Fractal sensation,"For those interested in Psychedelic videos, this tape hits the target. The only drawback would be the length. 30 minutes goes pretty quick, but feels like an hour watching this. Clarity could be a lot better, maybe due to the media used. DVD would be your better choice for this.Outside of that, it's a stunning array of light, soothing music and a tranquil experience. A must have for those who seek an inner peace. :)"
2,Nice art but disconnected unsatisfying story,"After having read the excellent Crimson Empire books, I wanted another taste of Star Wars graphic novels, and when glancing at it in the store, I was impressed by the nice action and artwork. I saw the story had lots to do with Mace Windu, and wanted to read it.I brought the book home and started reading. The book has two barely related stories, one about an attempt at making peace (which six members (half) of the Jedi Council fail to accomplish) and the second which ends unsatisfyingly with a ""perhaps the chancellor can exert enough influence on Nal Hutta to shut this place down.""The art is very nice, and a few scenes are interesting, but overall, a very unsatisfying book. I left the book on a table and reached for it a day later before realizing ""oh yeah--I'd already finished it""--the story is that unmemorable.Do yourself a favor and try the Crimson Empire books instead."
4,Almost there! Even better is ahead!,"This is a review of the Dark horse comic called STAR WAR: REPUBLIC - EMISSARIES TO MALASTARE, issues #13 to 18, also known as STAR WARS: ONGOING, VOLUME 3. What ever its name is I am reviewing ISBN: 1569715159 TPB issued august, 2001. It continues the story presented in OUTLANDER following Hett's son as a trainee at the Jedi Temple in Coruscant (or do we now call it chorussaunt). Dark horse has placed this comic on its timeline as happened before TPM but the cover says it takes place just after. i am putting it at -31.6 after NH on the timeline.This is where Dark horse turns a corner for me with this comic. Most of the art is 4 star quality. The story is 3.5 stars, so I have to round up to a 4."
2,One guy,"This book is more about the author's nerdy journey of self-discovery than it is about the Beatles, and as such is only of marginal interest. He comes on like a big Beatles fan, then goes on to attack much of their work roundly, and without much critical prowess."
1,avoid this one,"I found this book a dreadful bore..I do not need to hear about this guy's pathetic life..he takes the term ""obsessive fan"" to a level that only Mark Chapman could understand..everything in his life revolves around the Beatles (correction..mostly the soft mushy Beatle songs written by Paul)..he takes his first date to see Yellow Submarine,and his ""gosh golly"" enthusiasm over the film must've been a clear sign to his date that she was out that night with a loser......a friend of his is bummed out because he broke off with his girlfriend (bummed out because he'd probably been getting laid, as opposed to going to see Yellow Submarine)..so what does old Ronnie tell him to do?..""listen to the Beatles..they understand""...ye gods!!...and for those wondering what Ron is up to now, click on his name..you'll see he co-wrote a book on men bonding by getting back to their tribal roots for some sort of psychotherapy....ha ha ha"
1,Not as good as it used to be,"Make Up Artist Magazine used to be a decent trade publication where professional makeup artists could pool and share information. Unfortunately, that was years ago. The useful articles are few and far between,and are sandwiched between fluff pieces usually designed to stroke egos or plug the latest MA tradeshow. Generally, not worth the time if you're a professional in the business."
2,Is God Really in Control?: Trusting God in a World of Hurt,"I bought this book for our adult Sunday School class. We discussed a chapter a week. The name of our class is the Searchers. We have both liberal and conservative Christians, so there are usually some lively discussions. This was a very conservative book with no really new ideas. We seemed to be having the same discussions every week."
1,Bitter disappointment,"My husband and I visited Buenos Aires in February and were captivated by the tango, both its passionate music and complicated dance steps. We bought this video, hoping to see many experts dancing the tango. Instead, this DVD had numerous interviews with musicians and instrumentals and vocals. From beginning to end, it had less than five minutes of actual performers who were dancing the tango."
1,"more tango, less talk!!","This DVD is mostly interviews, with only about one-fourth music and dance. Big disappointment. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
3,decent quality for beginner,"I purchased this camera based on the fact it was refurb. and only 100 bucks. I think I got what I paid for. Photos are grainy and not the quality I expected. The camera just doesn't seem to work correctly. I've tried it in multiple applications, the Manual mode just is trouble, and it only seems to want to take pics on Auto mode. Just do your homework with this one. I 've always been a Pentax fan but i am changing my mind. Probably a good camera if not refurb."
4,"Great music, but no need for costly imports in the U.S.","Roberta Flack sings some great songs here, but of course you can get the very same CD at a much cheaper price by simply not getting the one labeled import, as this CD is. That said, ""Killing Me Softly,"" her tribute to Don MacLean, is a stirring number. ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" is without question one of the great love ballads of all time. These and other classic Roberta Flack tunes make for a solidly good compilation album."
1,Didn't work,"These are terrible! Quite a few of the reviewers said that the pills helped curb their appetite. Unfortunately, that was NOT true for me. I stopped taking them and threw them out :("
1,didnt work for me,"I heard about this product on a nip and tuck type of tv show from a doctor who said he wants patients to try this product before liposuction, no wonder he has a great clientle."
3,Not that fine,"I used this product for 3 weeks now, and there is no change !!!It's not that great, i'm a little bit deceived.I won't buy it again."
1,save your money,"If ever there was an occasion to read the customer reviews before purchasing a book this would be it. I had bought a couple of excellent books on backgammon {so as I could learn how to make the odd good move}, and this one arrived via amazons you had bought that, so now try this. Well folks the short answer is DON'T. Could it be that -author house- the publisher is a vanity publishing house? I will content myself with the thought that I don't dislike anyone enough to give them it as a present. Nool Pwang as they used to say in the Eurovision song contest!"
2,Pretty for the first DAY or so,Horrible quality! The ring is electroplated and is already flaking off onto my fingers/hands whenever I wear it! Not worth the cost
5,Four often overlooked greats,"Without going into any deep analysis of this book I just want to add that while I was reading I went back and listened to the music that these guy made throughout their careers.Each musician featured is an outstanding guitarist and I have been greatly influenced by most if not all of their work.Humble Pie was one of the finest British Rock band of all time, and with so little available information about them, I was completely absorbed by their chapter.This book is a simple treasure."
4,Must Read Book,"This was a very good read,could not put it down. If you love rock guitar and the masters who play them you will get this book for your collection."
2,Not really all that interesting,"I thought the book would either give some interesting insight into top tier consulting strategies or be somewhere near as entertaining as the TV show, but it managed to do neither. A relatively boring recitation of one guys short career at a consulting firm and not terribly insightful."
1,Doesn't live up to the subtitle,"I must admit that, probably like many others, I was attracted by the subtitle, ""How Management Consultants Steal Your Watch and Then Tell You the Time"". However, the book doesn't even come close to meeting this. It turns out to be a ""biography"" of the author's two years of (rather bland) experience in (too much) detail. Overall disappointing, and I wish I had read something more beneficial.I do admit that there are some interesting paragraphs, but overall, nothing that is new and worth the time to read."
1,"Not a Book...Maybe a Long, boring article","I was anxious to this book after reading some of Kihn's other work, but this book was truly disappointing.Kihn's description of his offsite sessions on performance feedback was hilarious, though it stopped there for me. I found the book to be lacking a center. It was a odd combination of short, dull articles having nothing to do with the title of the book.Kihn gets one star for a couple of his characterizations, but overall this book isn't insightful about the dark side consulting business, which does exist. Kihn just doesn't know enough about the business to bring it out, so he didn't.I wish I could return my copy."
1,Borrrrring!,"I really thought that I was going to get the inside scoop on ""HOW"" these management consultants managed to steal your watch, but the only thing that was stolen was my money and time in reviewing this text. Do yourself a favor, don't bother."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to reading more about exactly how poorly and ill-fitted to their jobs management consultants are, but the actual meat of the book strays far from the title of the book. It seems like most of the book was spent bashing HBS and Mckinsey people, the week-long training session the author was forced to go through (which was pretty funny however), and about office politics in the aftermath of layoffs.He only really discussed two projects that he worked on. Moreover, his writing style is very difficult to follow. He jumps around from topic to topic and then jumps back to the original topic without much warning. The last couple chapters that he spends actually discussing one major assignment he works on is by far the most interesting.Overall, the book is worth reading if you're interested in the consulting industry, but if you just want a funny read look elsewhere."
3,If you are a consultant you will relate to parts of it...,"A friend reccomended this book to me. It more depressed me than anything (because it so accurately describes me)There are some good points in the book:1. The consulting feedback and review process is a joke2. All consulting firms are the same, except McKinsey which is just the same but better3. Travel is probably the worst part of the job and points are mostly worthlessThere are some things that made me think:1. Why do I hate Sheratons but tolerate Marriott2. Why am I obsessed with my luggage3. Why do I get so excited at recruiting eventsHe also accurately describes a lot of the unspoken rules. Such as never eating in groups in the caffeteria.There are a few funny bits as well.I certanly wouldn't compare it to Liars Poker (not even in the same league) and the point about not having a point is well taken, its a bit rambling.If you are a consultant you won't be able to put it down. Everyone else will just scratch their heads."
1,Consider the one star reviews seriously,"It's amazing the shared experience I have with the one to two star reviewers. They said everything I'd want care to point out. Last I heard the author is actually writing for one of those 'hip' American business magazines. I wrote this just to say : To 'The Economists' shame, they gave this book a glowing review."
1,Thanks for the Spoiler Alert,"I wish if you were going to comment on other people's reviews, you would have the sack to use your own name like the rest of the positive and negative reviewers.I will express no opinion on the book or on other reviews, but I know Dave (see ""Real Name"" below), and as I recall he is neither now, nor certainly during his BAH tenure (oops, have I given up the name of the Major Firm) was he good friends with any of the yahoos in the Media Practice portrayed negatively. As I read the review, it sounded like ""the book is accurate, but boring/poorly written."""
1,Very Poor Use of Your Time,"I worked for McKinsey & Company for five years and then built, with my co-founders, a startup into a Nasdaq-listed company that I led for five years as Chairman & CEO.Based on that level of direct personal experience with top-tier management consulting firms and building and leading companies, I would simply say that there is a very good reason you can buy this book on Amazon for $0.22."
1,Beware,I'm not sure what Amazon is trying to accomplish with this item but if You buy each one individually it will only cost 88.46.Do not buy this item.
3,check the individual item prices before you click...,"Before purchase, one should check whether or not buying Season 1 of each series individually might be less expensive. DVD releases get re-priced all the time, but as of this writing (11/2007) the sum of the parts is about 1/3 the cost of the whole! 5 stars for the idea (and the content is OK too) but 1 star for the list-pricing of this combo pack."
5,"Great album, but not if it's your first Matt cd","I love Matt. His lyrical and musical talents are a rare treasure nowadays. Even better are his live shows, which is why I was so excited about At The Point. It's a great album, especially if you're already a Matt fan. It's got his trademark banter and a couple great covers. If you've never heard him before, though, start with Beneath These Fireworks or When Everything Meant Everything. Or just see a live show. Then rush back and buy At The Point!"
5,Great Puppet!,"While shopping for Christmas gifts, I happened by this item and found it to be very amusing. So, I purchased it, thinking it might make a funny visual for mythology, literature, and story-telling classes.The dragon is soft, well-made, and easy to manipulate as a puppet should be--for small to average sized hands. Big, big hands, however, have to careful about stretching the glove covering / fabric. One hand goes into the orange and gold striped neck glove and the other can go into the tail glove--to give it a wiggle. Intriguing discovery: If you place your hands and finger just right, you can wiggle the golden, forked tongue as well.The dragon is a good, attention-getting product to inspire children's imagination. Visualizing characters and designing puppet shows for parents / family promotes creativity as well as togetherness."
5,A wonderful resource,A great resource to find the meanings of names as well as their spiritual connotations. I have found it helpful in dream interpretation as well.
2,Average,"Was hoping that we could find some unique names, but nothing really hit us. The book does not distinguish between boy/girl names. We're not religious, so we didn't really need or have much appreciation for the scripture passages that accompanied each name (even if the name wasn't of biblical origin there was a scripture passage attached). Overall, not terribly impressed."
4,Not just names....!,"Looking for some Name information? This nicely written and researched book is not just informative, but entertaining. Let me explain. When you begin to look up your name and you find the information, you can't stop there. You begin searching for family members and then friends. Pretty soon you are on the phone sharing information and laughing with surprise! Well worth it's cost and a good read. Share it with church friends or Couples expecting. Many fun and informative ways to enjoy this one. Good buy!"
3,Just another name book.,"This book is just another baby name book, does not really give too much information on each name, it didn't even have my daughter's name in it (Scarlett) but seemed to have every other name."
3,NOT WATERPROOF!,"The background light died after about 1 month of having this. The face scratched super easily...I don't think it deserves to be called ""tactical"" by any means."
2,Not So Good,Really liked it when I got it in May. Then it stopped working in October.... not the baterry. Not happy with it
5,"Tough watch, with a trusted name","I have used Smith & Wesson products for a long time, and each time, the product has worked very well for me. This is not an exception. The watch is built tough, and I have had it for about 8-10 months. I used it for Police Academy, and for Security. Now, I plan on using it on the force.Pros:Tough construction, scratch resistantFits smaller wrists (not too big or too small)Never stopped working on meCons:Only con I could even imagine with this watch is that the velcro band tends to wear out over time. This is NORMAL. I still use the same band that came with it and it is fine, but I know I will have to buy another one someday.This is a very good watch, I highly suggest buying it."
3,Pretty more than practical,"Maybe my yoga mat is thicker than most, but I have a hard time rolling it slimly enough to fit back into this bag. There's pockets for little accessories, and an interior pocket for valuables (but again, if you have a thick mat, be aware that things larger than keys, Kleenex and lip balm and a yoga belt are too big to fit). That being said, when it's in the bag, I love how small and portable the bag and the mat become! And the color is absolutely delightful."
3,Interesting But Lacking Depth,"I enjoyed this book to a certain degree. Zinn covers a wide-range of topics and presents some interesting historical perspective and alternative viewpoints to many of today's important issues. However, I did not feel like I learned very much. The book is basically an introduction to many areas of progressive politics, so it would not be very helpful to someone who is already familiar with this topic."
5,Excellent History Book,This book really opened my eyes to all the limited and biased options we have everyday. Every page is packed with historical information for a wide range of topics from reasons of war to forgotten history.
1,This game is really boring!,"I find this 3rd installment of PSO to be an extreme disappointment. My biggest gripe about this game is not being able to play as the character that you create during battle. You can only use your character to run around the lobby. All the battles are fought using pre-made characters. The card battles are dreadfully long and tedious. Creating personal decks for battle becomes a bore after the novelty wears off. Definitely not my cup of tea, but I suppose it could provide hours of entertainment for others."
5,Great for Card Lovers,If you like Yugi Oh then you will love this game. It is the best game i have ever played. I like the Yugi Oh game boy game a lot. This one is even better than those because it is 3D.
4,"I dig it, but watch out.......","I really like Phantasy Star Online Episodes I&II, so I got PSO III. I heard that the game play was different, but I couldn't have participated HOW DIFFERENT. PSO I&II is so 'actiony' comparitively. The first time I tried playing PSO III, I thought, ""Use cards in battle? What happend to the weapon I just whipped out? What the %@&# am I doing?"" I was determined to figure out how to play the game though, and needless to say after practicing a couple rounds I understood how the action is supposed to flow. My friend Chris and I think that it's a prettty cool game. My friend Mike fell asleep while watching. If you can get into it, the game rocks. If you're not into RPG stratagy though, don't even waste your time."
3,Hmm..,Not a very good game compared to most internet games. I would suggest you wait for other Game Cube internet games that are acually good and spend your money on those.
4,The C.A.R.D. System,The C.A.R.D. system change the way the Phantasy Star game work and is a nice break to the normal hack-n-slash rpg style. It's a bit overwhelming at first but the game really picks up steam once you get the hang of the C.A.R.D. system.
2,Nothing compare to episode 1 and 2,"Unfortunately this game is nothing like the first two episodes. When i first started playing i notice that the graphics, looks, and animation are just the same as the other ones. Was hoping for a little difference. But i gotta tell you, read up on this game play before buying. If you're looking for the same feeling of adventure while playing episode 1 & 2, do not buy this. I mean you will see different places but this game is like an animated card game. that's why it's the card revolution. I don't think this game evolved. I think it just adapted to the trends."
4,Underrated,"This game is often bashed for being a card game and not at all similar to the first 2 PSO titles. However, this game is extremely fresh and still utilizes many of the great features form the first two titles. It can be summed up as Final Fantasy Tactics mixed with a Yu-Gi-Oh card battle. Very addicting to get new cards and make better decks."
2,Too Much Moisture....,"It is a good sized cover for plants but there is no ventilation. My basil was wilted within 24 hours of use. Needless to say, it was another useless purchase."
4,ZX-M - Great starter camera for the price,"I've had this camera for over a year now and it hasn't dissapointed. I wanted a basic camera that not only allowed me to learn the 'ropes' but also have the means to go automatic when I needed to. The only negatives: (1) the lens mount is plastic, not metal, so there may be a problem with wear in the future and (2) there is no way to get multiple exposures. But overall, this is a great starter camera. Highly recommended."
4,Great watch for the price,"This is a nice watch because it has digital and analog time keeping functions. There are three alarms, a stopwatch and a timer. The band is pretty comfortable and is easy to adjust. The only downside I can really think of is that I don't really use the analog face because it is just easier to look at the digital time."
4,Producto Muy Bueno y Elegante,"Una de las mejores marcas de relojes a sido Casio y este modelo en particular es muy bueno y ademas elegante, ya que es analogico y digital a la vez. Muy recomendable para todos los gustos. 100% recomendado."
4,Great product,"Always been a fan of G-Shock watches. I love it,however there is one downfall. I have big hands & the G300 face just looks abit small on ""my"" hands. I recommend anyone with big hands consider another model,but overall..great product."
4,one small problem...,"This watch is a very good buy for the price. It is easy to read, the functions are understandable, and I like the way it looks. The ""one little problem"" I have is regarding the small loop on the wrist band that retains the extcess strap after the watch is buckled. This loop is not fixed to the strap, therefore it tends to slide around until the excess strap comes out and invariably gets caught in places it shouldn't. This is a very small issue, but it does get to be annoying when it happens frequently.1/25/12I've had this watch a few months now, & I found a solution to the issue of the strap retaining ring. The strap had several notches more than I needed, so I took a chance and trimed a couple from the end. I kept 3 holes past the one that I use. After buckling it on then slip the retaining ring over the end of the strap. This works very well for me. Don't be afraid to trim the excess strap, it's worth the effort."
5,Great Watch! Long-lasting battery too,"Purchased June 2008 for $59.75The watch face won't get scratched easily like my Citizens always do. The face is protected well from any damage. Watch has taken a beating but still keeps excellent time, world time feature is great for travelers. I've worn it in the Pacific Ocean without any worries (mainly so the fish wouldn't come after one of my shiny watches). Light works well in dark environments and I use it a lot!The timer and stopwatch get lots of use.Battery is still going strong after three years of hard usage.My only complaints:1) the hour and minute hand take too long to reset if you have to turn time back. Casio should improve this to make it easier when changing time.2) digital numbers can be difficult to see at certain angles."
3,Decent watch - design of the face could be better,I like this watch because:- The analogue hands look less cheap than a strictly digital readout (IMHO) and are easier to read in various lighting conditions than a digital readout.- The recessed chrystal will make it hard for me to scratch it up.- I can take it scuba diving.- The band appears to be user replaceable- It has a number of extra features that will likely prove quite usefulFeatures that could be improved on:- The analogue hands are quite fat and block the digital displays so if you really need to use the additional features such as the stop watch you will want to stick with a strictly digital watch. Casio should redesign these hands to allow one to see the digital readouts.- The little digital dial that counts down the seconds graphically is a waste of valuable face space as it's so hard to read given its small size.In short - the analogue hands require some trade-offs but I'm quite happy with the watch nevertheless.
4,Heavy Duty,"I purchased this watch a year and a half ago and I think that this watch is heavy duty. One thing I would complain about is probably when it comes to set or reset the time. Nonetheless, It's a great everyday watch and trust me you'll treat it like I treat mine, drop it from a few feet down on hard surfaces, forget it under water, and knock your hand on hard surface without even care about the watch. In fact you don't even have to care."
4,overall is a good watch except...,"I bought this to replace the Timex one which only last 4 months. Want to try a different brand to see if they produce better analog/digital watches. It's really hard to find a durable, good looking one with a reasonable price tag. My son has this for a couple months, so far I haven't heard too much of his complaint about it. However, one function of this watch that doesn't make sense is the Time adjustment. This watch will not allow you to change time backward which I also read it in other reviews. i.e. you can only fast forward its hands to 5pm from 6pm, you can't back its hand one slot from 6 to 5pm. Not sure why but this is the only issue that we see it SO FAR. Overall, it is a good watch if you don't need to adjust time backward all the time!"
4,Not ur usual G Shock,Not as good as I expected to be because G shock is known for its big display. In this watch the screen is small makes it look kinda cheap. If u want to look cool in front of teenagers dnt buy it but if its for grown adults its a good watch. The wristband is also very thick n it can sweat u when the heater is on or in summer. ( ppl with hair )
4,watch for biker,"I am a biker. The band with groove as bike tire looks awesome. Love it. I wish to give five stars, but not this time. Maybe after three months."
4,"Solid, well built watch.","This is my 7th. Casio watch, and they have never, never disappointed me. You can't go wrong with a Casio watch, (unless you are into most expensive name brand types), but for everyday use and long lasting wear; this is the one.You must read the manual to get acquainted with the functions, since it may be confusing at first. Once you learn how to operate it, then it becomes easier to program. It fits right and has a firm grip on the wrist. the price was right also in comparison to department stores that sells this same watch for over $89 bucks."
3,A Good Watch,Hi there... I just bought this watch. So: 1)It is not as slim and good looking as in Amazon's pictures 2)If you have a big wrist you will think that this watch is a small one 3)It is practical and you can easily see the digital / analog time any time! 3)To be used mostly for after work time & sports rather than during work office 4)Seems to be a watch that won't be easily damaged 5) Setting time is a little more complex than ordinary watches 6)worth buy-it if you are not overseas where you are credited with extra tax / shipping costs.In overal : You wont be dissapointed - neither excited!!!
3,Music fan,"Don't waste your money on this set of releases, the older imports of these shows are all much better. It's as simple as that."
1,Give Me A Break,"Give me a break! While the #1 reviewer did an excellent job recounting the story (which I won't bore you with again), I disagree with here contention that this is a five star story. It plodded along while Deborah acts oblivious to the fact that her friend (who she talks to and shares all of her problems, trials and tribulations with) has, is -- and always will be in love with her. She tells this guy more than she does her husband when they are in med school, she takes a job after her residency in the same hospital that he works -- having kept in contact with him over the years by long distance telephone calls that went on for hours. This is an implausible ""contemporary"" tale. What spouse would smilingly take this kind of behavior?? Please, don't bother buying this one. Go to the library and check it out if you must ot buy it used!!"
2,Disappointing !!!!!!!!!!,"This book was very disappointing.It does not get interesting until the end of the story when Drs. Brody and Elliott renew there friendship. I never heard of ""just close friends"" becoming intimate the evening of the funeral of a spouse. I was looking forward to reading more by this author,but I think I'll pass."
2,picture/audio worse than vhs!,"Sacrifices had to be made in order to fit the Concert and Film profile all on a single disc.If you play this dvd, you will notice that the colors are nowhere near as vibrant as they were on the vhs.You will notice the reduced sound qualify if you turn it up. It sounds like the audio was compressed by a bad mp3 converter.It would have been better to simply make two dvds, and thus preserve the audio and picture quality, or even enhance them, as I did.I transfered my own purchased vhs copy to dvd, and set the converter to enhance the colors and sound. It might be hard to believe, but this vhs-to-dvd transfer surpasses the qualify of this professional dvd version.If you don't really care about picture/audio quality, it's a good purchase."
5,A Masterful Performance By An Artist of the Classical Guitar,"I have the video tape of this performance & will soon purchase the DVD. Each piece on this tape was performed with technical mastery and artistic soul by John Williams in the stunning Royal Alcazar Palace. Each of the pieces were rendered according to a standard of the highest manner of a master guitarist. I also enjoyed the diversity of music that was played on this tape-- that ranged from a Bach's Prelude from Lute Suite No. 4 in E Major, Skura Variations, or the Adagio from Concerto De Aranjuez. I used this tape as a background music for a dinner party with friends and it was very well received. As a classical guitarist I appreciated the absolute artistry of John Williams as he played each piece. I'd enthusiastically recommend the DVD or tape to anyone. It provided quiet an evening of entertainment."
4,Great DVD,Excellent presentation from a legendary virtuoso...also with an impressive autobiographical special feature containing the artist's perspective on his life and music...also with amazing scenery from Spain and Australia... recommended for all guitarists.
5,The Prince of the Guitar,"I have admired John Williams since 1971. He is the most brilliant virtuoso of our time, and I am thrilled to be able to watch him perform. I can examine his fingerings and apply them to my own playing. I particularly enjoyed the bonus feature about his biography. As a guitarist, I am always inspired by John Williams. He has been criticized for being too perfect and mechanical. I reject that as rubbish. His playing is flawless, yet extremely musical. If you appreciate classical music and the guitar, this DVD is a ""must have"" as Segovia once said, ""he is the prince of the guitar."" I say, he is the king."
3,???,"I wonder whose idea was 2 put Starship Trooper and Owner of a lonely heart onto 1 CD. Or I could say I've seen all good people and Rhythm of Love. Different music from different periods, only the group is the same. Yes should separate the work before 90125 and after, and a new best of CD should come up with hits from the Rabin-era. It is not easy 2 make a very best CD from their early material, where many of their best songs were 15-20 minutes long. Leave this very best and get their albums instead. Again: I give the 3 stars 4 the whole album, of course, every song on this is a 5."
3,Dry Kill Logic,"This release, although not entirely worthless, lacks the originality and charm that the two previous releases had. Their first release was angry, melodic and dreadfully heavy in the Nu-Metal genre...but it had an original meaty take on a dying genre of music. The second album, ""Dead and Dreaming"" was Dry Kill Logic with more focus and crunchier, more solid songs than ever!""Of Vengance and Violence,"" the third release from this incredible band left me wanting more. The guys seem to have been listening to a lot of ""Unearth"" and ""Thrice"" before the release of this album. It almost seems as though they are shamelessly jumping on the Metalcore band wagon.Dry Kill Logic..please don't do what Machinehead did! Bring back original music!"
4,long time fan says...,"I finally got this album just a week ago (it was hard to find actually). At first I felt a little let down but after a few times through I've decided it's a great album just different from their last. But wasn't Dead and Dreaming different from The Darker Side of Nonsense. They've simply grown and changed, as any band will do. I think the distortion on the guitar is a little weaker on this album and for me that plays a huge role. The riffs are still DKL - heavy, fast and dynamic. For the most part this is a solid album and anyone who loves DKL will enjoy this album in one way or another so don't be hesitant. Run out and spend the ten bucks. You won't regret it!"
3,Not bad,"I'm a fan of DKL after hearing their last alubm, The Dead and Dreaming. All I can say for this latest release is not as good as the last outing. For fans of DKL only...."
4,A spirited and spiritual read,"I enjoyed reading Master of the Jinn in spite of myself. I am an impatient and busy person, and don't usually have a chance to pick up a book until 1/2 hour past bedtime. So color me pleasantly surprised when I found myself staying up to the wee hours to finish this book over a couple nights. The story moves quickly, yet stimulates the imagination. This might be a good book choice for adolescent boys, who don't have many *clean* and interesting choices. MotJ is an action packed adventure, yet spiritual, too. Karchmar's respect for the human condition is apparent in the nobility and dignity of his characters. I recommend this book."
5,A thousand doors of wisdom unlocked,"Master of the Jinn is a life-giving tale of self-reflection, awakening, and ultimately, realization of Truth. Despite such spiritually lofty accomplishments, it is surprisingly approachable for the non-initiated and easily digested in a few sittings. Sufism, being a path that cannot be adequately explained through doctrines or discourses is here delivered in the most traditional form: through stories.In doing so, Irving Karchmar extends the undying legacy of sufi storytelling that has guided humanity (and jinn) through darkness and into light since the dawn of civilization. After reading it, I feel as though a thousand doors of wisdom have opened, each leading to a thousand more."
3,"Excellent beginning, awful rushed ending...","This books starts off very well. The initial character development is very good and the plot is intriguing enough to keep readers engaged. Unfortunately as the reading progresses the quality of the book deteriorates climaxing with the ending, which is horrible. It leaves the reader wondering whether the author was pressured to end the work or he just got fed up with it himself.There are some very good lines and deep thoughts in this book and that's why the three stars. Otherwise, it would have received two.R."
1,It is wrong and therefore worse than useless,"The facts are wrong. So why buy it? If you are new to the game,having incorrect information will make things harder, not easier. Foruseful information, check out the many EQ web sites. Also, players inEQ tend to be friendly - you will probably find some helpful experienced people to give you advice."
5,Incredible Amounts of Information,"Wonderful guide for the realm of Norrath. Easy to follow charts and graphs that list all items within zones, all npcs within zones, armor information, weapon information, all spells for all classes upto level 60, maps, and much, much more.If you have the Official Players Guide, it's time to upgrade to this guide. It's 456 pages of more information then I've ever thought about jotting down. Only buy this book if you want to know all the stats, strategies, locations, and tips of the land we call Norrath."
1,Should be called Everquest for Beginners,"I found the book to be of absolute no use to an experienced player of the original Everquest. The sole purpose of this book SHOULD have been to go through in detail the new zones, with new zone maps plus the new information creatures found in Kunark.But no.. there is only 1 new city map. There is NOTHING contained in this book that can't be found on the internet for free. The spells database is vague or downright inaccurate. I am mad that I was suckered into ordering this book and PrimaGames should be ashamed for labeling this book as a Kunark Resource.This book was pushed through by a company looking to ride on the hype on the RoK expansion pack.DO NOT BUY - You can get much better information off the net for free."
1,The reasons I can give for not buying this book,"This book has several MAJOR flaws which make it not worth your money at all. First, a good portion of the information is downright wrong. Typoes abound, and zones have been switched from continent to continent. For example, when you create a gnome and run to Misty Thicket like the book says, not only will you inevitably die getting there, it's an hour and a half walk. Nitpicking EQers have written lengthy reports of the typoes and misinformation contained within this disposable volume.The reason I give it one star is twofold: One, it can't get any lower; Two, it is a really good source of humor for existing EQ players who are willing to spend the money.I believe one issue of PCGamer said it best (although not about this guide, I must add). Required: Pentium 233Mhz Recommended: Store with good return policy..."
3,Its Good I Guess,It contains that info the I mostly required but for what some people expect from the book..... Lets put it this way it did not meet their standards. The book however contains a good amount of info that you might learn later in the game so if you are curious it is good. But for the overall it isnt great except for the stats and descriptions of the races and classes.
2,"Not bad, but not what I thought","I must disagree with most of the other reviewers. Although they are correct that much of the info isn't helpful for players with any amount of experience, there are some tidbits in there that can help you. Just bear in mind that you might have to dig to find them. (If you want a longer opinion of the book, look me up on the Seventh Hammer server, Farley of Rivervale)"
1,Worst guide ever written.,Most of the information is not even correct. I was extremely dissapointed. Verant should make the publisher recall this book.
1,Misinformation ruins this book,"This book has some handy information, esp. the listed stats of the monsters you might encounter. However, like the 1st Official book, it is full of errors and information that just isn't true.This guide is best for a new player as long as they keep in mind that they should be wary of all the stuff written in it. Use it to get started, then check the web for the best info on EverQuest.I'm giving this book 1 stars instead of 2 for the reason that as an official book, it should have be done right completely no exceptions."
4,Very good,"This is an interesting work by Isaac Brock. It's kind of an experimental album that uses a variety of different sounds and themes. It's not my favorite work by Isaac, but it definitely has some superb songs on it."
4,LISTEN TO 4 TIMES THEN COMMENT,"First off you can not go into this album thinking it is Modest Mouse. When i first bought this cd i was so excited to hear more cloud surfing music like all Modest mouse cd's. First listen i only like one song. after a couple of times i started falling in love with almost all songs. THe Hotchy Girl song is probably the most melodic and beautiful song i have ever heard heard drifting and flying in the clouds. I want this played at my funeral. once again this is NOT a modest mouse cd. If you are a true modest mouse fan, trust me you will like this and it will grow on you."
3,Great album for those researching Modes Mouse,"There are several tracks that don't feature any real songs, but instead random music. Those tracks are okay, but difficult to initially skip, because the actual songs start in a similar way. Still a great album, caught myself listening to Barnacles over and over again."
3,Decent,"You listen to this, and you realize how good Modest Mouse is (not just Brock - but the rest of the band - incredible rock songs) Here, though, it's just sort of electronic acoustica, and though the lyrics are still perfect (with some good collaboration), it just doesn't rock enough, honestly. It is fun to compare ""Things I Don't Remember"" with that idiotic Kenny Chesney song ""I Remember"" (that may be the title, if y'all know what I'm talking about) just to see the difference between being real and vacationing in North Carolina."
2,No title,"I have tried numerous times to get into Modest Mouse but have yet to accept the worthiness of it all. I had the opportunity to see Ugly Cassanova live and was bored to death especially after watching a crowd stirring set byLes Savy Fav. I thought, however, that maybe this music would fair better on recording. I purchased this album mostly because of the other musicians not from MM particularly Pall Jenkins of Black Heart Procession. If only Mr. Jenkins would have collaborated more then maybe it could have been an album worthy of his own band's dark genius. Instead we have pastiche."
5,Love it,"It has some of the best songs I have ever heard. Incredible variety ,lyrics are awesome.Every song is worth hearing.""The paristies are excited when you're dead""great line.Awed by genius."
2,Eh,Very strong tingle when applied but it didn't really do anything for me. My boyfriend said it tastes good though.
5,Amazing!,"When ordering this product, I thought it would be your standard edible flavored cream. It's more than ordinary...it really is arousing!! Imagine my surprise! It's great. And a little bit goes a long way!"
4,Although it remembers where you stopped it at...,"The resume feature is a must have which is nice on here, that's where the player starts exactly where you left off, but it resets the skip and bass features every time you turn it back on which is annoying if you're driving or working and take brakes etc."
3,"Great idea, execution needs work","Bought this for my 5 & 7 yr olds for Christmas. It's a great idea and the kids love the markers. My complaint comes in with the construction of the tower itself. It doesn't like to stay ""up"" and the lids are constantly flopping back down. I also bought the crayon tower at the same time and we LOVE it. I wish they would have used the same tower for the markers. Overall, it's great for keeping the markers organized and in one place."
5,Sent as a gift,I sent item as a gift for my disabled sister. She loved the variety of the colors as well as the holder they came in. This item was bought at same time as several velvet art sets sold here on amazon. She was thrilled!!
4,"Great markers, but our tower won't stay standing","I love Pip Squeak markers, and this set has a fantastic range of colors. They always wash out of everything for me, which means that I don't have to worry too much about what the kids are wearing while they play. I only gave this four stars, because our tower will not stay up - and nor will the tower at our friend's house."
4,Cool but not so durable,I purchased this set for my then 4 year old. A great idea but the tower would not stay up. It is still usable and the colors are long lived.
3,"Telescoping Feature does not Work, Markers are Great","This is a disappointing product. I would expect much better from Crayola. The markers are great, my four-year-old loves them. However, the telescoping case will not stay open. Any slight touch and it collapses. I will be putting these markers into a different case."
4,"great, easy to use storage container!","These markers are great! The only concern is that they are stored upright and that seems to make them dry out. After repeated use, this seems to rectify itself. The container is great! Easy to carry around and keep all of the markers together!"
4,Almost tickled pink,"I bought these markers for my 4-year-old. She loves the smaller size. We also had fun reading the clever color names. My only complaint is that the telescoping function of the holder does not lock sufficiently into place, so she was constantly frustrated by it collapsing anytime she put a marker away or got a new one out. Other than that, a fun, well-used product."
3,Dry out easily,"We liked these little markers and the telescoping storage container is nice, but some of the markers were dried out when we recieved them. The others seemed to dry out pretty quikly as well."
2,Poorly Made,"If you are buying this because the markers are cute and assorted (they are!) then by all means, this set is great. If you think the telescoping tower will be awesome, it's not. A piece of garbage that collapsed every time we touched it. It never really ""locked"" into place correctly. Now it is broken."
4,Mini Markers,"Cute! The tower lifts and locks which is a huge selling point. The markers are very small. I bought it for my 5 year old and it's perfect! Compact, neat, convenient."
5,Pipsqueaks ideal for pipsqueaks,Great gift idea. My kids all use the markers and then put them away!
3,Crayola,"Sometimes with the Crayola toys I feel like the kids are playing with the same toy in a different box. There is really nothing special about this set, it allows about an hour of entertainment value. It is only okay."
3,very youthful but too sweet,"I decided to keep this fragrance for those once-in-a-while occasions when I want something different. It is both sharp and sweet, almost like air fresheners or kids scents, I can't be taken seriously wearing this. But it is very happy and youthful, so maybe a good Friday fragrance... Not totally me, I think I will stick to more sophisticated perfume houses in the future, Bvlgari or Hermes..."
5,Orangy musky,"Smells fantastic. And it lasts for hours. The bottle is so beautiful! The fragrance seriously just reminds me of orange wood. So delicious! I came across a free sample from Ulta, and fell in love, and had to have a bottle. Amazon sells it for very inexpensive. Oh how I love AMazon!"
3,Really glad I bought this on the internet for cheap,"This starts off with a charming dark, musky aroma -- like ginger in the woods. Rapidly it settles in to sticky, sweet cinnamon bun. It's not terrible, but I don't like to smell like candy. The scent is very strong & has staying power. I think I'll wear this when I forget that I don't like to smell like candy & use it to scent rooms for holiday gatherings."
1,waste of money,"I usually LOVE this perfume, and I was excited to get it. But when it arrived, I didn't even recognize it, because the ""liquid"" in the bottle was brown and thick, like syrup. The smell was concentrated and cloyingly sweet. There's no way I could wear this."
4,Awesome! Twice as thick as other DH tubes.,"This is a very heavy duty tube. But weighs over a pound each. If you don't care about the weight, this tube is awesome. Twice as thick as most other DH tubes, therefore heavier as well."
4,Good Fun,"I haven't finished yet, but if you like some lighthearted reading this hits the spot. This book has the benifit to make you laugh."
4,outdoor humor,"A funny read, especially if you are an outdoorsman, as you will relate to many of the stories. Will keep it in the library for another time to read again."
3,OK,"This is a fun read, but halfway through I realized I can only relate to a certain level having never visited Alaska. On one hand, it makes me want to go even more. On the other hand, I'm not sure if I want to visit..."
3,Of Moose and Men: A skewed Look at life in America,"The contents of the book was interesting. I don't know if it is computer problem or what, but there many slashes and dashes and > and <. I liked the subject of short words, for example, ""Mudrooms"" and then the story."
1,Disappointed,"I had a Sunday afternoon that I could spend some time reading a good book, but within 15 minutes I made my way through this book and deleted it off my Kindle. It just wasn't what I had expected. I thought it would be stories of people/circumstances in Alaska, but it is the author's take on dogs, cabin fever, weather, etc. To some it will be considered hilarious. It just wasn't what I was looking for when I purchased the story. You may love it."
5,Wonderfrul Alaskan folklore,I really enjoyed Of Moose and Men. It is very well written and makes me want to visit Alaska even more. The author describes things and places so well you can clearly visualize them; even smell the smells. Couldn't put it down and loved the ending. I will definitely look for more of A.E. Poynor's books.
3,Just OK,"I read other reviews before I made this purchase. I was looking for insights into Alaskan life, especially during the winter. I did get some info. I did not find the book to be very funny. The humor is so consistently exaggeration, that I got used to the device and just expected it. I just came home from an Alaskan tour/cruise. The people are very enjoyable in their own special, independent way. I confess, I did think of scenes from the book occasionally with a smile."
2,Didn't finish it.,"Started off good, funny, laughed out loud a couple of times. But then it got really slow, tiresome. I quit a little over half-way through, got bored with it. I'll keep it though and finish it later if I am sitting in a waiting room or lose electricity for a couple of hours."
2,Too Skewed,It will take a long time to fnish this book because one can only stay skewed for just so long.
4,Of Moose and Man: A Skewed Look at Life in Alaska,"Having been in Alaska recently, this book was very interesting and insightful from the Alaskans point of view. A;aska is an awesome place."
2,Nothing special,"Pirate's Booty with Caramel is an OK snack. Most of the corn and rice puffs are uncoated and flavorless (think uncoated Corn Pops cereal), while the ones with caramel are crunchy and sweet. Each bag has 360 calories (allegedly 3 servings) and no vitamins or minerals (but 36 g of sugars and 69 g of carbs). These are clearly not ""Good for you!"", as the bags proclaim. I would pass on them and go for true caramel corn if you have a craving. These just left me with a dry and unsatisfied mouth."
3,Really crunchy,"I tried this in the ""Chaos"" mix, and really liked it, but once I got the case of them & tried it again, I found it to be way too sweet & really really crunchy. I could only eat a little of it, and my kids don't like it at all. It's definately better for you than regular caramel popcorn, but it wasn't a big hit in our house at all. Regular Pirate's Booty is much better."
3,"tasty ,but way too sweet","The popcorn shaped(sort of) kernels are covered(and not thinly,to my taste) with a coat of caramel(brown sugar, corn syrup,23g carbs per serving)and a sweet crunchy like texture of rice and corn meal that reminds you of a kids breakfast cereal( if you placed the booty in a bowl and put milk on them.)They are okay mixed (with say smart puffs) but alone way too sweet.For the health conscious in snack food,I would pass on these..If you want a better snack in this line, go with the smart puffs."
3,Pretty good.... Once in a while....,"I bought these things not knowing what they were, the first bag I was not too impressed with, but didn't know what to expect. At a different time and day I tried them again and really enjoyed the snack. Give em a try, you'll probably enjoy them!"
4,Feed Your Body Healthy Booty,"Hey, you have the munchies, so why not Feed Your Body Healthy Booty? These snack treats are delicious and healthy too! Yummy Pirate Booty for lunch packs, snacks, and just to start a conversation.Argh. Get some."
4,Good tamer for straightening curly hair,Be careful for this foam is very concentrated. Too much will make your hair feel like it has shampoo left in it. Use a very tiny amount for it will expand. It works very well at straightening curly hair with the aid of a round brush and a blow dryer. It helps with the frizzies too.
1,Not your typical Ducasse Book,"This is more of an asian fusion cookbook, nothing french. There is nothing mind blowing in this book. Even though I am a chef and Ducasse is one of my favorite chefs of all times this is not typical of his cuisine and not to my liking. The book is well put together and the photographs are really nice, but I ONLY RECOMEND THIS BOOK IF YOU LIKE ASIAN FUSION. It is really boring. Not an essential Ducasse book."
2,Find another book on stepcoupling,"Very general information, some assumptions made about the reader, and very few useful tips and /or things to try. Not worth it."
4,All stepcouples should read this!,"Great for people who are bringing two families together! The transition is not easy, but having some way of knowing something about the process really helps. Wish I would've had this book years ago."
4,Wish I had read 3 years ago...,"My fiance and I have been butting heads over the kids for 3 years. He has a 29 year old son who we really don't have to deal with. I have a 17 year old daughter and a 14 year old son. Boy were we doing things wrong! I truly feel this helped us strengthen our ""family"" unit."
4,An Important Reminder About A Stepfamily's Balancing Act,"The authors identify the many issues that stand in the way of a couple's happiness in blended families--intrusive ex-spouses, difficult stepchildren, a parent's close relationship to his or her biological children, to name just a few. Wisdom and Green constantly encourage readers to nurture the ""stepcouple"" relationship in the face of these challenges, and provide practical advice about how to do it. The tone is authoritative and hopeful, and the book includes interesting anecdotes from anonymous stepfamily members. ""Stepcoupling"" is a very useful and well-organized book that will help stepparents and their spouses grapple with many stepfamily challenges. As a parent in a family with ""his,"" ""hers"" and ""ours"" kids, I personally found the book both inspiring and overwhelming. It's an important reminder about how hard we must all work in blended families to balance everyone's interests and needs."
1,NOT a good book for the noncustodial stepmom,This book does NOT help with issues a stepmom may have with the childrens mother or with bonding with the step children. IT is a disappointment.
2,"Great Title, Negative Contents",The book seemed to spend all its time explaining all that could go wrong when beginning a step family and gave no suggestions on how to avoid or work out the problems.
3,It will depend on how you define success,"The very first success story is about a person who bought several rental properties with NEGATIVE CASHFLOW. What makes it really interesting is that this person's long-term goal is to buy enough properties to have $10,000/month cashflow. Which makes me think that this person is working in the wrong direction. Buying properties that need to be fed every month (cash-eating alligators) are making your cash flow OUT, not IN.Also, some people in the book don't include the vacancy loss in their simplified calculations. Yeah, I understand it's rented now, but if the tenant moves 6 month from now, it might take you 1-2 months to fill the vacancy.Overall, the book didn't inspire me. I would expect a better prepared book that inspires rather than makes you think what was the interviewee smoking when buying a property that needs cash inflows every month."
2,Maybe useful in a few cases.,"This book does exactly what it sets out to do - detail success stories. However you can get much more than this for free on the richdad website. Some of the success stories are groomed from there.This book is more of a ""how to"" than the others but it is not written by professionals, and I think the price is outrageous, especially since it is really an advertisement for all the other books.As with all ""gurus"" I would recommend thoroughly reading around the subject and the teacher before making your mind up.He does have good ideas and a forceful personality, but don't be fooled into thinking he has all the answers."
5,Rich Dad works for me!,"Rich Dad really changed my life. It got me out of complacency into working a plan for financial freedom. I have made over $140,000 since I read Rich Dad Poor Dad 1 year ago. This book fired me up too so I am working a huge realistic plan now. Optimal Thinking is helping me execute my plan and make the most of every day, so check out Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self for optimal results too."
5,Please read the book before criticizing,"Rich Dad's Success Stories may very well be the best of the Rich Dad series because it is so inspiring. It prooves that what Kiyosaki has been preaching and teaching works.And it is so obvious that the few 1 star reviewers have not even bothered to read the book (save the free sample pages)Read the book first as well as the original Rich Dad Poor Dad. And more importantly try it for awhile.I suspect that 1 star reviewers are people who tried the Rich Dad board game, failed due to poor programming and now want to lash at at Robert Kiyosaki. Or people who have a personal vendetta against RTK and will never admit that they are the one's that are wrong!Too bad for them!Unfortunately, these people will be stuck in their dead end jobs and living paycheck to paycheck too.Rich Dad Success stories is a good book"
2,Disappointing,"I am fan of Robert Kiyosaki, however I found this book very disappointing. The stories are so new that they really only talk about people making life-changing decisions in the last few years. It would have been better to tell stories about people who have spent at least 5 years utilizing Kiyosaki's principles, so we could see if their new life decisions were effective etc. Or, wait a bit longer and write about these people in a few years time. Two much better books to buy for stories about successful property investors would be two Australian books (and no, I have nothing to do with their authors or any company associated with their promotion):(1) Jan Somers: Building Wealth Story by Story; and(2) Jim McKnight: Ordinary Millionaires."
1,Thank you Wm J Irving!,"Thank goodness for conscientious consumers like Mr. Irving, for without him I'd NEVER have figured out what the ""St. Clair Entertainment Group"" had put together. As I'm assembling a semi-complete Jimmie Stewart Collection for my girlfriend (amazing such a collection isn't already compiled!), this was a great help. Plus, if Mr. Irving is correct, this has the two features from the more expensive ""pot o' gold"" collection, plus one more.Meanwhile, shame on St. Claire for their shoddy packaging, description, and marketing. I only hope they didn't screw up the sound or the 'pan & scan'."
2,And it's familiar,"Just to let it be known if you exclude the third movie the first reviewer supplied, I have this DVD and bought for ONE DOLLAR at Target. Just thought that was interesting."
1,No Real Information,"Amazon gives us the run time, and number of disc's,but they give ZIP as far as a description or content.Does Amazon really expect to sell a product when thereis no information telling what the product consist's of????Come on Amazon, the public is more intelligent than that.Amazon, you ask for a rating. How can I rate a product whenI don't even know what it consists of? The only choice yougive is a 1-5 star rating. How can I rate a product thatI rate as a ""ZERO""???"
2,"Okay, but.......","When I first purchased this book at Borders, I was super excited that they are making books. When I read it though, my expectations dropped severely. It is a waste of paper and simply cheaper to view on TV or on DVD. The writing style is very easy, practically a harder version of Henry and Mudge. It's just the episode in paper. Please do not buy thinking it is a whole new thing. I was disappointed. But of course, if you prefer reading, do not hesitate and buy it."
2,i HATE teen titans,"i cant stand readin or watchin teen titans. my lil bro LOVES em, and i have no idea y. i HATE teen titans! they r soooo boring!!!!!"
5,A Surprisingly Great Book!,"When I first discovered that I would have to read a classic in my 8th grade English class, one could say that I was less then happy. By happenstance, Jane Eyre was the first classic that I stumbled upon in our Media Center. It looked incredibly dull, but I thought that I would give it a shot; I couldn't find any classics that looked more interesting. Well to my own shock, I was immediately hooked on this book. The beginning was intriguing, the middle was unpredictable, and the end was--well, I'll just let you find out for yourself... The last bit of information that I will give to you about this timeless classic is this: when you think you know what is going to happen, think again. The surprises in this book sent me on a rollercoaster of emotions, and I strongly recommend that you readers take the same ride. It's great."
4,Good Story,"I was assigned this book to read my senior year of high school. Since it was my last year, I hardly did any work but I did read this book because it was wonderfully written. It was one of the best books I read for any of the english classes I have ever taken."
3,THIS IS NOT THE NOVEL! It's The Cliff Notes Cheat Sheets!,"Hey people, this is not the Jane Eyre book by Charlotte Bronte. It is a Cliffs Notes Study Guide version. This is good to read but only if you have read the whole book by Bronte and you have to write a book report and just need some references from the Cliff Notes version if there was something in the book that you didn't understand. Don't try to con your teacher by only reading the Cliff Notes version. Just read the book and read a great story and impress your teacher. It always amazes me how dumb some students can be by trying to cheat with Cliff Notes, I mean the teacher always can tell when someone has done it too so it's not like they are fooling anyone."
3,Too much detail,Charolette Bronte went into way too much detail about EVERYTHING. There was always a page and a half describing something with little or no relevancy to the story. There were also characters mentioned once in the book and then never talked about again which made it a little to confusing.
3,"Interesting, but tireing","This book was a class assigment and I had a short amount of time to read it. I would have liked it better if I had more time or if it was shorter. It is a very big soap opera, but the good kind. I would recomend this book if you had time on your hands and could stay awake to read it."
1,Don't waste your time,"I am a very slow reader and I had to finish the book before school. So, I set out that I should read 100 pages a week. Well, my next goal was not to fall asleep. This was the worst book I've read in a long time."
1,Soap Opera,"In the same style of literature as Pride and Prejudice comes the horrendously acclaimed story of Jane Eyre. This book was incredibly boring and had several major flaws in the plot. It also had several gothic elements in it, must like the new twists soap operas are adding recently (people possesed by the devil, etc.) This book isn't bad; there are much worse. Time would certainly be better spent reading something else."
2,It was so slow!!!,The story seemed to have a lot of potential in the first few chapters. I kept waiting for something really exciting to happen. Nothing ever did. I read the book for a class assignment. I practically threw a party when it was over with.
3,WILL CRACK OVER TIME,This is a lovely little unit and it cools the computer nicely. It does seem to be a bit fragile. I keep mine on a desk and it really never moves but over time it developed cracks in the plexiglas surfaces of the unit. The cracks grow larger over time and i'm waiting for them to advance to the point that the things falls in half. Its been about 2-3 years as I've watched the cracking plexiglas advance.
1,Product did not work,Out of the box this stand was busted. The on off switch was broken inside the switch itself and looked like it was shipped this way. guess more on the seller than the maker. The stand itself works well and i would have paid just for the stand. It was too small of dollar amount to mess with a return.
4,A well-crafted book...,"Not bad. Not bad at all. This one's a reader's read. In some ways a throw-back to the way good books from years ago used to read. Most of today's hatchet jobs are written for people with attention deficit disorder-200 pages and out-- but not this one. This one's not afraid be descriptive, which is good because its meticulous attention to detail really makes you feel like you're there. It's the kind of book for people who thoroughly enjoy the written word."
5,"Excellent, heart warming story",Who ever suspected Joel Siegel led such an interesting life? I couldn't believe all of the experiences he wrote about and the funny insights into his family. He included a chapter on Yiddish words which was informative and amusing. Of course throughout the book was the touching message to his son.
5,Lessons for Dylan,"Great book! Fun stories, a very interesting and varied life, and many poignant moments along the way. Loved it."
5,A WONDERFUL BOOK,"This is a warm and knowing book of memories and advice passed from father to son. The advice is sage; the stories move gracefully from touching to hilarious. This book, a gift from Mr. Siegel to his son, becomes a gift for the reader, as well. It's a great present for Father's Day, and, in my opinion, for any day at all."
3,Show improved during second season,"People who became fans of this show after the first season ended should be aware that the first season is quite different than subsequent episodes. Yes, Janice was already showing her hot-and-cold, sometimes sweet, sometimes venemous personality, but the show's models were generally much less attractive when the show first started out. In addition to there being fewer exceptionally beautiful people in season one, there was also a lot less flesh shown. While I've often been a bit surprised by how far this show has gone in terms of nudity in subsequent episodes, the first season is hardly titillating at all.I love this show's later episodes because Janice is hysterical and the men are hot (and usually at least half-naked), but this first season is honestly a bit dull."
3,Bonus features were a disapointment,"I'm not going to comment on the show itself, just the DVD set.The bonus features left a lot to be desired. It was basically a montage of Janice having some temper tantrums, which might be amusing to some, but got old quickly to me. The clips were taken out of context of the whole argument, so you didn't really know what was going on which did not make it interesting. I was hoping for something with more depth, such as more interviews with the clients or models.That being said, this review is not for anyone who isn't familiar with the show, but people who are wondering if the DVD set is worth it. If the bonus features would be a deciding factor for you, I say forgo buying this set. But if you want it anyways, go for it."
5,JANICE DICKINSON ROCKS!!!,"IF I LOVED SEING HER ON ""AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL"" & ""THE SURREAL LIFE"" SEASON 5, I LOVE HER MORE ON HER OWN SHOW!!!!SO FAR I ENJOYED THE FIRST 3 EPISODES CAUSE THIS GIRL IS REAL!! & THE WAY JANICE IS SHOWING HOW HARD IT IS TO GET TO THE MODELING BUSINESS IN HER SHOW, BELIVE ME,THAT'S THE WAY IT IS EXCEPT FOR THE PART WHERE JANICE HUGS THE NOT CHOSEN ONES GOOD-BYE!! I'M WRITING THIS CAUSE MY COUSIN WENT THROUGH ALL THAT PAIN IN ORDER TO BE AN INTERNATIONAL MODEL SINCE THE U.S. WASN'T BUYING OR FEELING WHAT HE HAD IN STORE!!I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE SEASON 2 RELEASED ON DVD TOO!!!!"
3,An Entertaining Show but deeply lack of Professionalism,"If the goal was set up clearly right at the beginning to create a Top Modelling Agency which creates Top Models, then a highly professional team will be needed. Certainly you can feel it is not there yet in season 1.One of the main reasons i was interested into watching this show is because they have BOTH female and male contestents.Plus one piece of advice to the producers not necessarily to this show, but to ALL other similar shows - Truly put the contestents right in the centre of the show, not the people who are already famous!"
2,Rock video but not real hot,I know Ninn is the artistic guy of porn but it doesn't work on this film. The women are very pretty but we don't get to see what we are looking for in this film. It just doesn't work and is not erotic.
2,Stay away from this model,"I've had problems from the beginning. The first unit I received looked used and had parts missing and broken. Customer service was great, I got another one in a couple of days with the same issues broken and incomplete packing. I was able to get a working unit out of the two that were sent. The biggest complaint now is that the handle will not stay attached to the tank I have a ""portable"" unit that is anything but portable! I cannot move it anywhere without reseating the handle every couple of feet! In all not worth the aggrevation."
3,So-So,The hose and wand are mediocre.......this sprayer didn't quite live up to its price and promise. Additionally the handle kept popping off and I had to permanently fasten it with SS screws. Probably would not buy it again.
5,Great Sprayer,"I bought the sprayer for the larger wheels, very stable. Works better when using in the yard. Great product, would recommend."
5,Melting Pot Memories,What a wonderful book! The anecdotes were great - the pictures could have been from my family and the Yiddish expressions at the bottom of the pages were very nostalgic. Loved it bought 5 copies.
1,inappopriate for 8 year olds,"my daughter was shown this video in her 3rd grade class and came home quite concerned and upset about the movie. While it sounded accurate and did not show a lot, there was discussion of amputations and childbirth with screaming in the background. Probably more appropriate for 10-12 year olds..."
3,NOT MICRO USB,"As the other reviewer stated, this is not a micro usb cable. I ignored the ""zen"" part because I thought it was for a MP3 player, and I didn't look closely enough at the pictures before I bought it. It appears to be Mini type A. I'm sure it will be fine, but this isn't what I need. The seller has no phone number on the invoice so I can't really get help from them in any kind of a timely fashion, and it would cost more to send it back than to eat what I paid for it."
3,"Looks Nice, Lacks Utility","Overall, the watch is nice to look at and seems to keep accurate time. The analog part works great, but the digital parts are practically useless. There is a digital ""sweep"" counter that cannot be seen unless you activate the light. During certain times of the day, around noon and midnight, the date feature is unreadable due to the analog hands obstructing the readout. The stopwatch is useless if you use it around the :15, :45 times."
5,Great everyday watch.,"I bought this watch to wear everyday because all my other Citizen and Tourneau watches were getting beat up at work. It is a solid unit. The watch is a G-Shock so you know it can take some abuse. All and all, a very nice everyday watch"
4,"Stylish, Rugged, and Inexpensive","So I've worn this watch for about 6 months now, so I have a pretty good idea of its capabilities and limitations.PROS: It looks great (minus the band). Obviously it's going to be rugged since it's a G-Shock. The hour and minute hands stand out well against the black background. While the hands get in the way of the digital information, it's only slightly and you can still make out all the details. The back-light is ample. It strikes a good balance between displaying information and not blinding you.CONS: Setting the analog hands is cumbersome, but not impossible. It just takes some time and patience. The band has an alligator-type pattern on it, which I do NOT like. They should have continued the resin material down to the clasp from the bezel. I deduct one style point from the star rating because of the band. It's borderline tacky."
3,Hands in the way,"Strap and bezel design are great. The hands are in the way of the digital display that makes it hard to read the digital time. Digital time does not show up well in bright light, but hands do. Automatic hand adjustment is nice and convenient, you can switch between day and date digitally very easily which is a good feature.Programming is failry staright forward and there was no fogging or malfunctions after diving with it. Count down timers worked well."
3,Just a correction...,"According to Casio, this model does NOT have a mineral (hardened glass) crystal or lens."
1,Poorly engineered DVD,"I regret having spent $17.99 to acquire such a poorly engineered DVD.The sound level is abnormally low so I have to pump up the volume, almost double the level I use for other DVD.When I do it there is this low sound that comes from the equipment and makes the whole experience painful.There is no way to choose the type of sound reproduction you want - regular stereo sound or 5+1. And this DVD was manufactured recently.You pay $17.99 for a 50 minute documentary. There is nothing else on the DVD. Not a single extra.The music is altogether a different thing, it is magnificent.My recommendation to anyone is to avoid this very poor edition."
1,Disappointment,"I dance Argentine Tango; it consumes most of my time. I bought this DVD, thinking it would include tango dancers. It doesn't. It's mostly about tango musicians, almost totally about Daniel Barenboim (pianist), who plays tango music. I would have preferred a DVD about tango orchestras in Buenos Aires, or some of the great dancers. I would have enjoyed bandoneon players too, like Piazzola, who also composed. Unfortunately, most of Piazzola's compositions are not meant for dancing.If you dance the tango, buy something else."
1,One of the worst games ever.,"I purchased this game when it first came out and recently sold the game and the entire system. This is one of the worst, dullest (if that's a word), most repetitive games that has ever been made. Your job as a smurf is to jump, or duck. That's the whole game jump or double jump over something or duck under a black blob (crow/bat). After about five minutes you will have mastered the game and be able to repeat it over and over and over. The only way to win however is to either pass out while playing or rip the game from the console and lock it away for all eternity. If you enjoy watching paint dry while simultaneously rubbing open cuts with cayenne pepper then you will truly enjoy this game."
2,"Lots of camera panning, not much actual ""movie""","Although I would not really consider myself any kind of expert on this genre, I thought I should at least give some feedback about my impressions. I do own at least a few other titles in this genre. The main problem with this particular item is that, even though it is supposed to be a video / movie, the vast majority of the ""action"" is simply camera panning across still images. I guess I would suggest, ""Don't waste your money."""
2,what were they thinking,This movie does have a story line infact a good one. The issue is the delivery. Its the 20 century and their anime motion really sucked. The movies was mostly sketches of what should be going on. If it actually flowed it might have been good. It is moving art work not a movie.
2,Not that good,"The art is pretty good. There are plenty of sex scenes however, 90% of the sex scenes are just camera panning over a still image with the main girl talking in her head. Pretty much a giant boner-kill."
2,"4 for idea, 0 for presentation",Great story but the presentation is poor and choppy. Very hard to enjoy anything when the whole movie is 1990's lip animation and pan over scenes.
3,Classroom of atonement,This anime was ok. I did not really enjoyed the story to much. The boy was the leader of group and the girl choke each other to death.
3,wow,hated the movie i perfer a more up beat theeme.but one must be careful when choozing adlut movies i guess some would like thou. you decide.
5,Perfect blend of ruggedness and style,"For a long time I was against getting a G-shock because most of them in my opinion look hideous.One of the reasons is that they are usually bulky and plastic looking.This is slimmer than any G-shock I've seen with nice metal accents that give it a more sophisticated look.The indiglo brings me back to my childhood and the different windows are easy to see. Worth every dollar. The only thing that could make this better would be more luminous hands, but you can also just indiglo and set it digital time to see what time it is."
4,Does Exactly What it Says!,"This watch does exactly what it says!! I have had this watch for almost a year now. I brought it through amazon.com. Not only was the price great....this watch offers the baest in style, functionality, and sturdiness. I used this watch for everday wear, running, and working out! It take quite a beating and the appeal..and appearance remains in tact! If you looking for a watch of quality...for those with a active lifestyle....this is the one for you!! The only dislike is that it is a bit cumbersome to make adjustments to the watch (i.e. change the time, date, etc.) without the pocket manual...otherwise....A+ watch!"
4,Worth it...,"Carter Beauford is perhaps my favorite drummer. I've been studying his technique and grooves for several years now, so I had to have this video.I would have actually liked to have seen more drumming, but if it was 10 hours long, I would still want more drumming, so, it's a good value overall for the price.I go back to this video time and time again to watch him play along with some of DMB's songs.The Bottom Line: I would recommend this video for any drummer who wants to build on their jazz/funk/fusion experience. I've taken several specific licks/fills/grooves from this video and have applied them."
1,Total Rip-Off,"The descriptioin of this item is in my opinion totally misleading. I ordered 2, expecting 2 bundles of 40 each. I assumed that 40CT meant 40 individual notebooks - a count of 40. I could not imagine that anyone would charge this price for 1 pocket notebook with 40 pages, but they did. I walked into the trap so I have to swallow the expense and learn from the experience.Hope you do not. LR"
3,Looks like pirate version,"The book looks cheap and comes with weird printing quality. There are strange shadows somewhere here and there around the graphs and charts. Alto the location of the body of article is different for different pages, some close to the right margin while some to the left.In a word, does not look like something decently produced in the US. Little bit disspointed."
3,Spin Bike DVD,"This is a very well-done DVD. The workout is well-explained. Technically, it is very good. However, the background music is too loud which makes it very difficult to hear the instructional parts of the DVD. It is the only bad aspect of the DVD, but it is quite a negative feature. If I had a choice of this one and one without loud background music, I would choose the other one."
4,Fondly remembered---wish it continued,"I used to love this in the old _Heavy Metal_ magazine, back in the days when I bought _Heavy Metal._ The combination of supernatural horror and the Old West was something I'd never seen before, and a lot of the characters rocked, including Tex Arcana himself, his girlfriend, the mysterious Woman in White, and the two hapless little demons, Sweazey and Herm."
2,two out of three,"Let me just put it to you this way, thank god the two stories ""Bodywork"" and ""Chinatown"" were in this anthology, because the first story was awful. The heroine was more of a guy than a woman...skip it and read the other two. And, be sure to buy it at a discount store, otherwise it's a big waste of money."
5,That rating is for the Karin Tabke title,I loved the Karin Tabke novella. It should have been a stand alone title. She is a great new writer and I have since read her other titles. I would put her right up there with Lori Leigh and Lori Foster.
2,My baby screamed,"My baby did NOT like this sling at all. I have DD cup size and there just didn't seem to be enough room for baby to be comfy with them AND my post-partum belly. I got the appropriate size, but it just wasn't for him. Ended up with the BabyBjorn carrier and he liked that a lot better. He is a 'sit up and look at the world' baby rather than tummy time kid... The quality seems very good though, but instructions are a little thin."
4,"Funny, Worth Watching","If you're a fanboy then you'll like the special. It's basically the same as two episodes back to back. Same level of hilarity as the normal show, in my opinion.Since it's basically two episodes, it's somewhat expensive at around twelve bucks per episode. Oh well."
4,Very Funny Christmas Special,"I'm a huge fan of this show so when I heard they were releasing a christmas special I immediately went out and bought it. The episode itself was hilarious and very well written. More cursing,blood and crazy antics we have come to expect from the gang.A big highlight was the claymation scene where Frank is brutally murdered by the gang for being such a jerk.One star is deducted for length of the episode(only 44 minutes)and cost of DVD. For that little amount of time it should have cost like ten bucks or something. They also should have had more special features than they did.Much better for a rent than a buy but still effin hilarious."
4,Worth it,There are several laugh out loud moments in this Christmas special. It's definitely funnier than any episode I've seen this season.
2,Great Episode - Poor Video Quality - Buy DVD Version,"This is NOT HD Quality video!! Buy the DVD version. There's even a disclaimer ""extra"" from the producers explaining it's upconverted and not HD.That aside, the episode is a great part of the It's Always Sunny world. All the Seinfeldian characters are in fine form making bad decisions, bickering, etc. as usual. Why a DVD instead of broadcast - well you get a nude Danny Devito from behind, some extra swearing and a claymation montage.Not the funniest episode ever, but not the worst, either. If you like Sunny, you should like this DVD."
2,Sunny's so funny they're charging 26.98 for 43 minutes haha,"Always Sunny is tied for the best show on television (with Curb Your Enthusiasm), and is the best show on a cable network. It's A Very Sunny Christmas is extremely hilarious, but charging 26.98 (even though right now it's on sale for 14.99) for basically 2 episodes is down right criminal, and a slap in the face of Sunny fans that have been there since the beginning and remember when they owned season 1 & 2 and no one else had heard of the show. Not to mention with how much they're making on all the season DVD's, they could have sold this for $5.99 and made good money. If this is any indication that Season 5 on DVD will be $40-50 they can expect me to stop supporting them by buying the DVD's and start downloading and burning the seasons for free.Love the show, hate the expensive route they're headed.2/5 $26.98 WTF U DRUNK?!?!"
2,"Funny Movie, Bad Blu-Ray","The show is hilarious and this episode is hilarious. It was originally intended for TV but was deemed to extreeme. My major issue is that this is not in HD quality, its a poor DVD upconvert and there is no way of knowing this until you pop in the disc and actually view a message from the producers.Now the Blu-Ray is cheaper than the DVD, but upon release, I paid more. I wish i could sxchange this for the standard DVD so atleast i could share it with friends."
1,$17.99?!?,"i am OBSESSED w/ it's always sunny and own all four seasons, but i will NOT buy this, no matter how bad i want it... i pay damned-near $18 for a WHOLE SEASON of shows (ok, $21, but you get my point)! this price is ridiculous in the extreme; frankly, even $9.99 would be over-priced. in fact, considering the itunes price of $1.99/30-min episode, this xmas dvd should be less than or equal to $5. i will wait til off-season when the dvd is (hopefully) discounted, and if it's never discounted: oh well. this price says one thing to me ~ the creators are just trying to get what they can out of their fans b/c they know we're extremely loyal. unacceptable.i agree w/ the other commenter from ATL who said that the show itself will be five stars ''''' b/c it always is, so i'm not judging on content here, only on price. it's just a turn-off."
1,BLANK DVD,This DVD was completely blank and did not work. I emailed Amazon about this and am still waiting to hear back.
4,Confused with stand alone episode,"I'm a huge fan of the series so I purchased 'It's A Very Sunny Christmas' and watched it immediately. In comparison to the free weekly episodes, this is right up there in terms of humor. I had a few laugh out loud moments. I just don't understand why this was released separately and not just included in season 5. It's only one episode (43 minutes worth) and it basically costs the same as entire seasons. I wasn't really happy about that but, being a huge fan, I purchased it anyways. At least there could've been some more extras or something. The DVD doesn't include many and the ones they have aren't the greatest. Wish there could've been more bloopers and/or gag reels. Great episode and great show but loses a point because this unnecessary stand alone episode cost me extra money for no good reason."
1,"BUY THE DVD, NOT THE BLU-RAY!","The 1 star is for the actual Blu-ray Disc, NOT the movie. It's literally an upconverted DVD picture smacked onto a Blu-ray. I purchased this thinking I was getting a High Definition picture of A Very Sunny Christmas, but Fox has really sunk to a new low by doing this. Do yourself a favor and purchase the DVD because there's NO reason at all to pick this up over the DVD: same picture quality!As for the actual movie, if you're a fan of the show, you'll absolutely love this. My only problem is it's not much longer than 2 episodes, but it's very well worth it. Throwing rocks at trains, screwed over business partners, omni bot, stolen presents, old friends in a rut, designer hand bags full of Cheetos, Lamborginis, Frank sewed into a couch, and Charlie 'pounding off' are just a fraction of this hilarious Christmas special. Get the DVD!"
2,"Is not HD, do *NOT* buy on BluRay!!!","I liked this and found it to be as funny or funnier than a regular episode. It is not shot in HD, the episodes that air on FXHD are much better quality. The extras are stretched to fill a widescreen TV. Overall I give this a 4 stars, but there is absolutely no reason for this to be released on BD, when the quality is DVD. If you like Sunny, buy it, but save the money and get the DVD release."
4,This item was a christmas gift.,I gave this item as a gift. My son loves the video. he has other ones in his collection. It was in perfect condition.
4,"A bit pricey for one episode, but worth watching","In typical Always Sunny fashion, the gang celebrates Christmas. I've been wanting this ever since it was released, but struggled with paying so much for one episode. Granted it comes with coasters, but still...There is nudity in this episode and the worst part about it, it is Frank (Danny Devito)! It is sooooo funny and worth seeing the show just for that moment. If you are a fan of Always Sunny, I can't recommend this more, however I would just suggest holding out until a good deal comes along. Merry Christmas Boners."
3,"An ok movie, but not that funny","I am a huge fan of Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, but I did not find this movie to be very funny. The plot was pretty poor and specifically, the animation scene towards the end was just plain stupid. I would not buy this movie if I were you, as it's not worth $20, but it might be worth a rental if you are really into the series."
2,Not what I expected from Sunny,"My friend and I are huge fans of this show. This Christmas episode however was not what we expected. Just a little too extreme even for us. There were limited parts that I found funny and most of the lines that maybe were supposed to be funny just made my jaw drop. My friend had the same expression when I glanced at her which was the funniest thing about it. There is a cartoonish part at the end that is quite violent and vulgar and reminded me a bit of South Park, however, not very funny. Like I said, I usually enjoy this stuff but maybe the fact that it was supposed to be a Christmas special made me think it would be more cute/funny than vulgar/violent not funny. At the end my friend commented that it may have ruined Sunny for her. We do continue to watch the show though!"
2,PQ sucks!,Love the show but the picture quality is horrible on Blu Ray!!!!!! Just buy the standard def dvd!!
2,Not worth purchase!,"I watched a rented copy last night and so glad it was not a purchase. It was a disappointment! First of all I was excited about the Christmas theme but there was just not enough funny. Plenty of typical ""Sunny"" bizzarre moments but its so nice when you get done with a regular season epsiode and have a bounty of funny quotes and I can't think of one for this special. For any fan, its definitely worth seeing but I would not purchase on its own accord, wait for when its included with Season 5."
4,"Funny, but nothing that special.","It is funny, but it is really just a long episode. The use of ""F"" word threw me off a bit, not a big deal for me but I didn't expect it. Over all I did enjoy it, but I thought it would be a bit more special then it actually was. If your an always sunny fan I would say go for it, if you are not then your a robot, because everyone loves always sunny."
5,Best Christmas Special Ever!,If you are already a fan of the show you HAVE to buy this DVD. It's one of the funniest things I have ever seen and you will not be disappointed! I was seriously in tears for half of the show because I was laughing so hard :)
4,"Hilarious, but I admit may be expensive","I am a huge fan of Always Sunny and would definitely reckomend(Charlie spelling) this DVD. Yes, it is expensive. I was lucky enough to get it discounted with Seasons 1-4 on the deal of the day(Thanks Amazon!) so it didn't really effect me. The added violence and cursing definitely made me wish every episode could have it! They use the cursing efficiently and always to great effect. If you like Always Sunny you can't really go wrong with this DVD. I was excited to see Mac and Charlie paired together again(Lately the dynamic has been Frank/Charlie and Mac/Dennis) for some great, hilarious moments. Loved it and think you will love it too!"
3,"Priced to take advantage of fans, unfortunately","I just downloaded this for $10 last night and watched it. It has some awesome moments, mostly with Frank and Charlie, and is certainly more explicit. Overall, though, it sort of places in the middle of the pack when compared to all of Sunny's episodes. I think very few viewers are going to say this is their favorite ep.More important, there is no way in the world, no way at all, that it's worth even $10. Just comparing the list price of the Season 4 DVD set, this special is worth less than $8 if you count it as two episodes.I love the show. I bought a D*ck Towel for a friend! Clearly I am willing to give these guys money. But in this case the pricing of this just reeks of make-a-quick-buck greed from FX. You should definitely try to watch it, but borrow a friend's copy or rent a digital version online or something."
4,Hilarious!,This is bound to make it in your regular holiday rotation. I bought the Blu-Ray but it doesn't appear to have been shot in HD cameras. It's a little grainy compared to their newer seasons which have since switched to being shot in HD. It might not be worth the extra cash for the blu ray - but no matter what format you buy - this is just an amazing movie. There are many scenes that will have you laughing out loud.
3,Great service but pretty crappy movie...,I LOVE this series and was really excited to see this Christmas special but was very disappointed... not really funny at all but at least the service was great!
4,for those who enjoy dark humor and aren't easily offended,Love this video although not for anyone who is easily offended. I love how these characters take situations and real human behavior and show how ridiculous the world can be. It will definitely be one of my annual Christmas flicks. :)
5,It was a VERY sunny christmas,"The blu-ray disk of ""It's a very sunny Christmas"" was hysterical, Amazon sent it fast and in pristine condition. The blu-ray version is not different then the regular definition version but since I own a blu-ray player why not lol. I think there's like a 2 minute clip of rickety cricket and mac talking about blu-ray and that's it but that in itself was kind of funny."
3,Not a family Christsmas Flick!,"Let me start by stating I am a huge fan of the normal fx series. While I enjoyed the movie I did not find it as funny as the show. I have no idea why! I did enjoy it, and want to watch it again though. It's nice to be able to add it to my collection of Sunny P DVD's. I'm glad I have it!"
3,Rip-Off,"Full price for a 43 minute movie... What kind of crap is this! My advice for you is to find a friend or two (or three) to throw in on it, that way you only spend a few bucks. Otherwise, I don't think it is worth it. It is an extra-long mediocre episode at best. And the extra ""The Gang Singing Christmas Carols"", I don't even know what to say about that part, it is like some kind of demented 80 music video! I love Sunny, but buying this DVD felt a little like dropping the soap in the prison shower."
3,funny but bs on the price,"5 stars for the show, 1 for the price...yeah it's funny but where the hell do they get off charging $25 bucks for what is basically 2 episodes? gimme a break...save your $, download it off the net and laugh your ass off..."
4,Are they serious with the price?,"They show the list price at $26.98, for a 43 minute ""movie""? $19.99 is still way too much for what is basically half the length of an average movie. I'm a huge Sunny in Philly fan, but I'll have to wait 'til that comes down to around $12.99 (what the price should be to start with). I hope they show it on TV, but as best I can tell there is still no word on that (edit: looks like it will NOT be shown).That being said, I have no doubt the show itself will be 5*, so I have no problem going ahead and giving it that rating. I mainly just wanted to comment on the price. I'll edit my rating if need be.edit: Down to $17.99. Getting there."
1,Grotesque and not funny,"The point was--I suppose--to make the most disgusting, violent, disturbing, dark, sacrilegious Christmas special ever. They succeeded on this point, but at the cost of the charm and humor that made me a fan in previous seasons. I didn't enjoy watching a straight hour of depredation, selfishness, hatred, materialism and crime in a Christmas special--without even the most meager interlude of humor--just so the cast can show off their chops as ultra-ironic/satirical/edgy. I watched the show with the expectation of enjoying some comedy before bed--I left unsettled and unamused. If that's the direction the show is taking I'll pass in the future."
1,Misleading Photo,The mount pictured is not what's shipped. From the photo it appears that the slot runs the entire distance of the lower portion of the bracket. The one I received in the mail has a much shorter slot and doesn't fit. Very disappointing.
3,Not as good as Voyaging On A Small Income,"I got this book after reading Voyaging On A Small Income and was a bit disapointed. It is all written in the ""first we did that and then we went here and did this""-fashion. They are just sailing to Brazil, as the title says.Don't get me wrong. It is a good book about sailing to Brazil, but it just doesn't touch my fantasy as much as Voyaging On A Small Income. Also, I miss some information on the sailing. It's all about the destinations."
3,A bit weak,"While I do think that Ms. Pulliam Weston knows her stuff, I don't think she covered the things I need to know in enough depth, and some of my most burning questinos were not addressed at all.She speaks mainly to people who have somewhat stable finances and are capable of following her suggestions. What do you do if you need to REALLY repair a VERY bad score? The scores she considers to be ""bad"" are in the mid 500s or above. She assumes that you probably want to tweak your credit a little and have a higher credit rating already, for the most part. She only briefly addresses the concerns of those of us who really have credit problems.I'm giving this book a 3 for those reasons."
3,"Repetitious, and Not What Most People Need","I bought this book after reading all the other great reviews, and almost returned it. If we remove the concepts of ""have a secured credit card"", ""Pay bills on time"" and ""keep your balances low"", this book could be two pages long.It's actually not terrible. But most people who have problems with credit either have bankruptcy issues, or have been deceived by someone, and need to get something off their credit or know their defenses. This book just doesn't go there. It plays into the hands of the credit industry without telling the consumer anything about OUR rights. The FICO score is a fictitious number the credit bureaus gives us, and then make us PAY to find out what it is! Go figure!"
3,Good basic overview,"Gives a good basic overview of credit scores. However, I was hoping to find the answer to my particular problem in this book, and the author just brushed over it. I have a good credit score (760), but too many open credit cards. The author just says that there is nothing you can do about this because closing the accounts would have a negative affect on your credit score. But what if I close one account every 6 months or year? I was really hoping for more feedback than just stating that I'm stuck with the open accounts."
3,basic,"After reading other credit report books, this book seemed quite basic with a lot of common knowledge information."
5,very good,"Hi- when I first considered buying this I read the reviews here which went both ways but listened to the sample tracks..I like what I heard. Listening to the full length album was fun and entertaining. There are a lot of changes...unpredictable harmonies, tempos, little things in music that makes this fun to listen to over and over again. There are only about 3 tracks I skip through regularly..mostly short instrumentals, and out of 16 tracks that's not bad."
4,Fresh and dancy,"I think this debut is fresh and dancy. You can play it at a party without receiving disturbed looks and it has a bunch of potential hits (""In Green"", ""2nd Gun"" ""Around the dream"" ""Fisty Cuffs"" ""Two Exclamation Marks"").The lack of professionality is rather ironic and adds to their lesser serious approach to music.So, this is innovative pop punk with a good lot of 80's nostalgia.This all provides one thing: even after three weeks of listening I, myself can say: HELL YEAH! I'm still excited!!"
5,Does what it should,"I've installed 4 out of 5 of these and they work great. Takes some time drilling the hole with the hole saw, but once that is done these fit in just fine."
3,Interesting to say the least,"Their last film, uses the team in non-comedic team roles. Not the first time, but it really stands out here. For an A&C fan, worth looking to see the changes that they went through as a team and all. Mostly this is a Lou vehicle, worth a look, but certainly not a classic."
3,Dance With Me Henry,Their last film together and not one of their best. However if you are an A and C completest you need this. Possibly now oop so get it while you can.
2,last of the great movies,"It is what it is. The last of the A&C; movies and it shows. Some nice gags. I personally enjoy the scenes with the train, being a big train fan!Where is IT AIN'T HAY????"
2,"A SAD,SAD FINAL FILM","ABBOTT & COESTELLO'S LAST FILM AS A COMEDY TEAM ""DANCE WITH ME HENRY"",ISA SAD FINAL ENTRY. I BOUGHT THIS FILM ALLREADY KNOWING THAT THIS IS FARFROM EVER BEING A CLASSIC,BUT I AM A COLLECTOR AND A FAN OF THE OLD COMEDYTEAMS OF YESTERYEARS.THIS FILM IS A MUST FOR ANY SERIOUS FAN.SURPRISINGLYA BIG MAJORITY OF BUD & LOU'S FILM HISTORY IS AVAILABLE ON DVD,WHERE ASOTHER GREAT COMEDY TEAMS ARE HARD TO LOCATE AND IT IS VERY RARE TO COMPLETE AN ENTIRE COLLECTION.""DANCE WITH ME HENRY"",FAILS TO DELIVER SEN-TIMENT OR COMEDY,BUD & LOU LOOK TIRED AND BOTH OF THEM CRAWL FROM ONESCENE TO ANOTHER.IN MY OPION THE DIRECTOR HAD NO SENSE OF CONNECTION ONHOW TOO CONSTRUCT A FILM.BUT ALSO BUD & LOU SEEM UNCARING,THEY REALLYDON'T TRY TO LIFT THE HEAVIENESS OF A FILM THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN LIGHT ANDLOOSE.EVEN UNDER POOR DIRECTION ABBOTT & COSTELLO COULD'VE SPARKED SOMEENERGY INTO THEIR SWANSONG."
5,Some of Athen's finest,"I love this album and so has everyone else I have played it for. The lyrics are dark and trippy (true to Rieger's style), yet the music leaves me feeling upbeat. The only thing better than this album is seeing them live. Buy all of their albums. Go see the shows."
2,A Stellar EP,"On Elf Power's fifth release Creatures, the Athens, GA psychedelic rock group streamlines their sound. In doing so, they've also strangled the creative urges that fueled their dark tales and Grimm-like fables. There's a five-song stretch mid-CD, from ""Palace of the Flames"" to ""Three Seeds"", that indulges their hookcraft and melancholy to make one long for the stellar EP this could have been. Otherwise, Andrew Rieger's surreptitious tunes, complete with serpents and ominous birds and other fantastic images, fall flat. Psychedelic visions represent best with psychedelic music - making them sometimes funny, sometimes frightening, sometimes pretentious, but never tedious."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"I like when guitars sound like guitars. Moneen used to like that too. Now they want to bury their organic distorted guitar timbre under echo-effect processing. Why? I guess it's because they're stupid. Maybe the guitarists both suffered some injury to the head recently. I'm listening to this record and I really don't hear Moneen at all. I just hear The Used and Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance. I hear a bunch of safe, conservative, overproduced riffs and melodies that don't pack any punch, either rhythmically or melodically. Even the singing is just like please play us on the radio. Moneen was one of the few higher profile emo bands that still reminded an increasingly insipid scene of a time when rock bands sounded like rock bands. R.I.P. Moneen."
5,Philosophy Novels Tend to be Good,"'Maya' by Jostein Gaarder was an excellent book. I believe it to be well written, and I enjoyed how it tied in the 'deck of cards' motif, which was of course reminiscent of the 'Solitaire Mystery', also by Gaarder.As a philosophical novel, 'Maya' covered many bases that most philosophical/religious novels do not tend to think about. It nicely tied in evolutionary theory to various philosophical and religious viewpoints.Despite my praise, I'd say that the average American most likely would not appreciate 'Maya'. But everyone should read it anyway."
2,Based in the 90's,"Seems like ths is advice that is firmy stuck in the 1990's. As all job search books, there are some good ideas and examples, but nothing earth-shattering. There has to be more up to date and contemporary books out here. That's my story, I'm sticking to it...."
5,Perfect from begining to end,"This record is beautifully put together. The careful ballads (Lady Fair, Face Like Summer) are as moving as ever and the pop tunes (This Summer's, Fresher than the Sweetness) are infectious. It's a record you want to listen to from beginning to end in one sitting and given the short length it is easily done. All in all this record is a great intro to the band. Once you own it you will immediately want to explore their other selections. This is band that deserves much more exposure than they get here in the states. This yankee says its a must own!"
2,Hard to Assemble Hot house,"I was please to receive my greenhouse. The included instructions were incomplete and difficult to follow. The online instruction provided the missing information but was still difficult. My husband & I assembled it to the best of our ability but were unable to complete the front roof/door installation. After a year in this condition, it failed to withstand a fallen branch. It now has been reinforced with a tarp roof. Only vanity keeps it standing in my yard."
3,Give it time!,"I thought this was pretty average at first, but if you give it time the tracks really do grow on you... There are some pretty amazing songs on here after all! I recommended this CD for those who like Israel Houghton and other funky, gospel worship music."
5,thanks to the other review!!!,"I don't usually buy books based on one review, but I'm so glad I didn't miss this book. I agree with the other five-star review. The author did so much more than provide a romance, even more than offer a sweet romance with unusual (for romances) characters. She wrote with humor, and thought. She made me think, when I wasn't laughing or simple enjoying the story. I really hope more readers will give this book a try."
4,This is good fun!,"Being a fan of photo booths, it is interesting to see people in the public eye, that we at least think we know, acting like everyone else when faced with an opportunity to ham it up on a strip of 4 photo booth pictures. Celebrities who visit MTV's shows are invited into the MTV Photo Booth, and it is interesting to see who can relax and be themselves, or who has to keep up their public face, even when told to cut loose. Looking at the faces of the celebrities here, you can see who seems uncomfortable, who cuts loose, and who stays in character. You will be surprised with who seems the most relaxed, including Celine Dion and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Lenny Kravitz stays cool, while Adam Sandler looks downright uncomfortable. I am out of the demographic of many of the celebrities on display, but I can say I knew who at least 90% of them were. This book is a lot of fun to look at again and again, and analyze, and enjoy."
5,One of the best punk albums of all time!,"I discovered this band of reading up on my favorite band the buzzcocks. Bought this cd at a local record store and was hooked. Contains their first two albums plus some of their singles. The Do it Dog Style material is better than the Bite Back disc, but both are well worth the money. Highly recommended!"
1,Irrelevant to 'industrial ecology',"Searchers for authoritative information on business and industrial ecology should be aware that this book is really mis-titled. It has essentially nothing to do with industrial ecology, except indirectly, and does not discuss industrial ecology. That's too bad, because the title is tantalizing."
5,Beautiful. Combines powerful imagery with interesting facts.,"A wonderful work that takes you to France and gets you buzzed. A window into the world of wine-making. Full of information that will be interesting to arm-chair wine makers. Overall, a great read that is hard to put down."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought the same product called ""Dew Drops"" a few years ago and loved them. I couldn't find them for sale on the internet and bought these instead. They are just OK. I don't think the quality is very good. There are lots of strange looking pieces. The taste is allright but I wouldn't order them again."
3,the dirtball raptillion,"I was impressed with this cd,I only heard one track from a dvd, it made me order it,if you like kottonmouth kings rap style beats you will like this cd,I would have given it a higher rating,but to me there were only 4 banging tracks,that's not to say the rest wasn't good,overall a worthy purchase to add to my suburban noize collection.I look forward to the dirtballs next album."
4,product,good and meet my expectation.recomanded to anyone who need that.good product make fresh rice all and every times.thumb up.like it.
5,Excellent Rice!!!,"I recently just ordered this for my parents for Christmas, I know this Tiger brand is the best out of all the rest I've bought and I know my parents will love this as much as I luv too. Trust me this rice cooker cookes the best rice."
3,Burnt bottom,"I have only used this product a few times. The bottom of the rice or the pan always gets burnt. Even when I turn the cooker off as soon as it turns to warm, the bottom of the rice still gets burnt. I am not very happy with this product."
1,AWFUL - I GOT FRUSTRATED,"TODAY IS NOV. 21st 2004. Almost 2 months ago (Oct 1st) I bought this Stuff... WHEN I RECEIVED IT... SURPRISED it comes LOCKED & ONE HAVE TO E-MAIL TO: MILTON@PLANETKC.COM TO RECEIVE A ""PASSWORD"" TO HAVE THE AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER IT...WELL ALMOST 2 MONTHS LATER AND AFTER SEVERAL E-MAILS STILL I AM WAITING FOR MY PASSWORD, SO EVEN THAT IS MY STUFF I CAN NOT USE IT... BECAUSE ""THE TRIAL HAS EXPIRED""... AWFUL, DISAPPOINTING, WEIRD. HOW IS POSSIBLE THAT?"
3,Wolf files CD,"This is an OK product for those learning radiology. The files are set up in teaching manner and cover quite a few types basic plain film radiology. On the down side is the fact that security for the product is so tight I could not use it after two days. The unlock code that was provided by the manufacturer would not work, even after tech support, and two weeks later I finally received, through the mail, an unlocked version from the manufacturer. There could be more files but it's not bad if you can get it to work."
2,Not That good,"I did not like it because is not a real atlas, it doesnt have CAT, or MRI. And the images are not that great!!"
2,I'm Working on That: A Trek from Science Fiction to Science Fact,"Not what I was expecting. I thought there would be more technical info. I was let down, the title did not match the book."
2,Is Shatner really so helpless?,"I got tired of the running comentary, ""I'm so helpless. I'm so clueless. I'm afraid of technology"". It didn't help me feel that I could trust the book to be ""correct"" when it got to the technical parts.Don't get me wrong, the explanations of the technologies in the book are very easy to understand and give some good insight but there was just too much fluff for me.Yes, I am a technical person."
3,"An easy, enjoyable read","First let me say that I've been a Star Trek fan since Star Trek priemiered in he 60's, although I preferred Jean-Luc Picard to James Tiberius Kirk. I'm also a technically oriented person, with a background in physics and computer science, so I came to this book already reasonably well informed on most of the topics Shatner wrote about.Despite that, I still enjoyed the book. Shatner and the scientists he spoke to do a good job of explaining in plain English some horrifically complicated and obtuse subject matter. No one should think that they'll walk away from this more with more than a very rudimentary understanding of the basics of, say, Artifical Intelligence, for example, but deep understanding isn't Shatner's goal. Rather, his goals, are to convey some of the wonder of science as well as to warn about the potentially fatal pitfalls that we'll have navigate in the years to come if we are to survive our creations."
5,Great stuff,"Whether you love Star Trek or just want a fun book to read, this will not disappoint. What a pleasure!"
3,What happened to the powder antecedant product,"I bought the powder version of this product at the close out discount stores up until about a year or two ago, and am about to run out.Spray 'n Wash is the only product I ever found effective to get out collar & cuff grime, and worked as well as anything else on oil, grease, wine, taco sauce, rust, grass stains, etc.The premixed liquids, although more effective, are way too expensive.I can empty a 22oz bottle at $3.50+ retail in one or two loads.So the powder, although less effective on stains, was a bargain at $0.99 or $1.99 for 1.1 lbbut I can't find that product anymore."
1,DON'T GET THIS,I got this pogo thinking you could go 6 feet in the air but then it wouldn't go much higher than a foot. If you're looking for a pogo that looks cool you sould definately get this but if you are looking for a pogo that works DON'T GET THIS.
3,Not great,"This book although very compreshensive, does not really cover Portal, Integration and Workshop in all that much detail. It does an excellent job on covering the WebLogic Server, but not these other components. It also doesn't really cover Liquid Data or JRockit.Is this then truly a ""platform book"" ? Seems to be better titled as ""WebLogic Server"". I must say though that it does a good job at what it does cover, and thus the 3 stars."
4,Great Book,"This bood has a level of depth and bredth that other books just don't have. As another reviewer said, there is a great fusion of technical and human-element content here.I look forward to another volume from these authors on the very cool new stuff in the 8.1 Platform!Add this book to your shelf."
3,Not bad...Not great,"There are too many mistakes in the sample code.Instructions are not always clear.For example, in the JMS section the book instructs the reader to fill in parameters as required, but it doesn't provide a good enough explaination as to what parameters the user should use. If I'm learning the material I might know the ins and outs of each parameter.I agree that there is not enough treatment of parts of the WebLogic platform outside of the Server.Otherwise it's not a bad book."
5,Simple and Sweet,I love this story. It is very original. I use it every year with 1st graders in a lesson to promote imaginative thought.
3,Cute,This is a very cute book beautifully illustrated. The story gets a little lost in translation. Overall a cute addition to any book collection.
5,"UNIQUE, HONEST AND COMPELLING","Simply put, this is a fantastic read! Anne Soffee's tale of life in the Hollywood fast lane, pursuing her own rock and roll dream during the glorious hair band era of the late '80s and early '90s is a bona fide pager-turner -- far more riviting than the type of backstage tell-all I expected. I not only connected with Soffee's story (filled with sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll, junkies and trannys), I also connected with the her myriad of fascinating characters. Soffee's journey became my journey and her friends became my friends. However, one mystery remains -- whatever happened to Aunt Titty? In short, I enthusiastically recommend ""Nerd Girl Rocks Paradise City!""Christopher LongAuthor"
1,Nothing new here...,"I was originally interested in this book because of the different angle it is presented. I must admit, it does make a refreshing change to read about the subject from an outsiders point of view rather than arrogant members of these bloated hair metal bands. This book however has very little to do with all of the bands, it is 90% an autobiography by someone who deserves an autobiography about as much as me; i can also name drop 80's metal bands as much as the next guy who owns any Hair metal box set. If the author does have a knowledge about these bands it is not presented here. Lets face it, if you buy a book on this subject matter you will want specifics.I suggest Hell Bent for leather by Seb Hunter. Its pretty much an English version of this but funny and presented with more passion."
2,dang,"This is pretty much the worse CD ever made. . . The only reason this album gets 2 stars is because Mac Dre is on it. Got the album, listened to it numerous times, etc. Bottom line the CD sucks."
3,Fine But Flawed,A pretty good document of early Nazareth live. Although tracks 11 to 14 are not BBC sessions at all. They are clearly just lifted directly from the Rampant album. A fault of the BBC's - seems they were not a session but were simply broadcast at the time as tracks from the new album. Somehow in the BBC's fog of time they have assimilated them as a BBC session which they are most certainly not. That irritating error aside here is some prime Naz.
3,incorrect information but interesting to read,This book is interesting to read but that is it. Historical facts need to be explored and I am pretty sure lot of them are incorrect. Particularly the exodus from Egypt. entertaining though.
3,The kids love it but it is not very durable,"This is the second shockrocker we have purchased and the kids love playing with it in the pool. The first one we had lasted several years with only leaks in the side pillows. The one we purchased this summer had a leak in the side after the first day. There are several different air pockets so that a leak doesn't affect the entire float, but it is disappointing that it didn't last for at least a full pool season let alone a week! It is probably repairable but we haven't gotten a chance to try that yet. The kids do love it in the pool though!"
2,Okay,"This toy was disappointing. Maybe my expectations were too high. My kids tried and tried but could not get any momentum going to create the wave effect. Basically a floating couch which isn't bad - just different than we planned on. Too big for our pool, a 24 foot above ground. It seems very durable. We have had no problems with leaking. Storing the beast is a little difficult because it is huge. We ended up just bungie cording it to the ladder so it does not roll away."
2,Lots of fun while it lasted,I ordered this in April for a birthday swim party. We used it that day and put it away for summer. My daughter and her friends have used it a handfull of times this summer but last week the whole bottom portion that you sit on ripped clean in half. We take care of our pool stuff and all the less expensive toys have held up. My daughter is very disappointed as she loved this one. It's useless now that you can't sit in it.
2,not worse the money,we bought that its huge and the kids loved it but after 2 week it already start loosing air bad so i paid all this money and it only lastet 2 weeks
1,Leak Rocker,Leaked after 1 day of very light use. Was not durable at all. Took a long time to fill and a short time to leak. I am returning it tomorrow and I hope to get my money back. The manufacture information doesn't exist except for the email address. Made in China.
3,Smaller and somewhat durable,"Hey all, there are so many sun islands to chose from. This is ok for the kids but it isn't the most durable. Should have bought an adult version for the way the kids jump and pounce on stuff. It is good for the price though!"
4,ShockrockerWe,"We used this for a 9 year old Birthday party and it was a hit kids loved it. The only problem I found is that when it rains it holds water and deflates the pink rings, this is easily solved by turning it over when it rains."
2,"uncomfortable, awkward","not worth $70. We floated down a very small serene creek in this raft, and it was 'ok' but it was awkward to get in and out of and the kids really didn't enjoy it any more than just a plain single raft. Plus, before the trip was over, it had a leak!!"
5,I love cooks,This book just takes the cake of being the best book for the lowest price i have ever seen. And its black cover makes me think of the happiness involved in reading it.
4,A Totally Different Allen!,"I purchased this DVD for one reason: Allen Leech. The young Irish actor who plays Tom Branson on ""Downton Abbey"" is one of my favorites in that show. I wanted to see him in a different kind of role---and I certainly was rewarded. You love him in ""Downton Abbey"" and you hate him in ""Rewind"". This proves what I've been telling all my friends: Allen Leech is a fine actor! I was pleased that Amazon made it available to me for purchase!"
3,Dark Irish Thriller,"Karen's has a nice little new life in a small town with her husband and her daughter. She attends her AA meetings and is trying to forget the life she had before. Unfortunately for Karen she learns that your past cannot be simply locked away in a closet. Sometimes it comes back to haunt you in the form of Karl an old boyfriend with a less than sinister agenda than to get Karen to help him with a scam situation they were both involved in years before.The movie is very dark and I don't mean ""scary and deep"" I mean I found it hard to see what was going on at times.It was an OK premise and the actors do a good job with a mediocre movie plot. Karen's husbad was my favorite character and I found myself wondering if the movie was coming full circle in a way. Umm..things to ponder."
5,Love the series!,This is the fourth of in the series about Matthew Mckendrick. It is a wonderful story that is very well written. I have read it several times and never get tired of reading it. It is a nice ending for this series to see the changes in the main character and some resolution to the cries in his life.
1,National Geographic Greeting Card software.,"It is too hard for the novice, and not powerful enough for the intermediate user. The photos get loaded several times per languages and are not named in a convenient way."
1,Don't waste your $4.00!!,"I just received this product and have tried to install it 3-count 'em-3 times. No luck. It opens and immediately closes. The customer service person sent me a 4 page list of things to do to correct the probllem---all of it very intrusive. Like I'm going to give them all that personal pc info! I can afford to lose the $4.00, but it's the principle."
1,Smells like mall during Christmas,"I received this as a gift and using it once was enough. The cinnamon smell is overwhelming. It reminds me of walking in a mall during Christmas with that horrible cinnamon smell coming from everywhere. Give me a French aftershave any day like Chanel Antaeus, it is well worth the price difference."
4,Great deal long wait,Appears to be correct product and arrived in great condition but compared to most other items I purchase took a long time to arrive. If you figure a few weeks delay into the deal then it is worth it
5,The BEST electronic pet...ever,"I love Tamagotchis. I currently have over 30 of them, but the original ones are my favorites. Very easy to take care of and fun to watch change into different creatures. Took me a long time to get bored with them. I wish I could still buy these things in stores (not the new ones, but the original). I miss my old black, white, and orange tamagotchi."
5,Fun,This toy is so fun. First it is and egg than it hatches and it goes through the stages of life. I thought it was going to be weird but boy was i wrong. It teaches you responsibility!
2,Bleh.,"NO fun. So it teaches responsobility. It's boring. There's only one game and it makes no sense whatsoever. It makes annoying beeping sounds. You get the same one over and over again. The character, I mean. Don't waste your money."
4,Yay!,"I bought it second hand, still works cancel button sometimes needs to be pressed deep to work, some outside damage,( had stickers on it, screen a little scratched), reminds me of my first tamagotchi, different cover, now I get to actually take care of it instead it dying while I'm at school, lol."
4,Really strong album from Saves the Day!,"First of all this is close to 5 stars but that is saying it is perfect. Very few things are perfect, but this is seriously good!I'm going to make this quick because I am a man of few words. I have been a fan of STD for about 6 years and I have all the albums and I've seen the shows. I have no idea why people are saying that STD is straying away from their ""sound""? This album is a great progression and true to form STD from Track 1 to the end of the cd. From first rotation I was pleased, hell I was stoked! If you like STD and you see how they have been ""changing or progressing"" through the years, then get this, you won't be dissapointed. It rocks. Great drums, great melodies, great vocals... you know it's Saves the Day. You know what you are going to get. Enough said..."
3,Transitions are fine but this is beyond that...,"I have been a STD fan for a long time and really enjoy their music. This CD, honestly- is not great. Now I didnt say it was bad- but it is not classic. Transitions are fine and as a drummer and vocalist having experiances in bands I know they are inportant for growth and to stay fresh- but this CD is a little byond that. The vocals are slightly different, the songs sound like they are tying to follow the new wave trend and very few songs stay true to any form of Saves the Day.I am not a big fan- Its not even the vocals- its the music as a whole- the change isnt working. There isnt a song I can really fall in love with or that sticks in my head all day like ""Always Ten Feet Tall"" OR ""Shoulder To The Wheel""- there stuff in this cd just doesnt work."
3,This album definitely kicked them out of my top 5 favorite bands.,"Unlike most people, I was a HUGE In Reverie fan and consider it their best album to date. Which is why I was disappointed to hear them attempt to kind of revert back to their older style.Vocally, he really hasn't changed much at all which is a good thing. The vocals on this album were actually very very good. The lyrics, they seem kind of fake. How many times can you say ""shredded skin"" on one album. I find it hard to believe Mr. Conley still has such an abundance of ""emo"" feelings built up inside him.I just feel that instead of moving forward with this album, they took two steps back and now they have to dig themselves out. Or not.There are a few good songs on here but not enouggh to make me wanna keep this in my cd player.Standout tracks:""Shattered"" and ""Don't Know Why"""
5,You negative people are all crazy...,"First off, the best album next to this is ""Through Being Cool"". If you don't see why, you are ridiculous. As a musician and knowing music in general, this album is awesome. Yes it is a different style of music and a good move. Just get it, and in comparison to all the other cds, it is top 2 tied with Through Being Cool if you are a fan of that cd. If you are a 16 year old reading this you probably don't care about Through Being Cool. This goes to the people here who were 17+ when first cd came out. That is all"
2,Im dissapointed.,"I read in a magazine that they were going to back to the more punk sound that made Through Being Cool a hit. I was PUMPED when i read this. Although they do go back to a more i dont even wanna say punk sound, maybe a more energetic sound, it doesnt get me like TBC CSD and SWYA. Im not saying everyone so dont get so damn offensive about this, but older STD fans will most likely not like this. It doesnt have the same energy the old stuff when they were younger. I dont hold this against them at all though, theyre getting older and they most definently dont want to write about high school anymore. Theyre not selling out because this is different than almost anything ive ever heard. I dont know, if you have a very open mind then you may like this, but i just dont like it, its not the saves the day i know and love."
2,Are... Are You Serious...?,"Truthfully, I was appalled with the amount of regression the band sounds like they went through after listening to this album.I agree the flow of songs and how they sound is uniform, but monatonously so; why not throw some variety in? Songs were so blatantly angst-filled and yell-filled that STD felt like a bad 16yr old version of themselves. The beauty of Stay What You Are, I feel, is that a genuine effort was made by Chris to sing well, even though he isn't the world's greatest. I felt not a hint of effort on this release. I cannot imagine anyone over the age of 16 actually liking this album or being able to connect with it on any level.I was tempted to first buy this album, but I must say that I do not regret for a moment that I downloaded it first.Hopefully, after another few years, STD will learn how to write and sing songs again."
3,Good Record,"It's ok, but not their best albumI mean I am more into their old stuffGet it if you are a fan"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Through Being Cool is the only Saves The Day album I like, and after hearing this new one that hasn't changed. Apparently this album was promoted as being a return to their older sound, but they don't have the youthful exhuberance to make something like Through Being Cool again. They've committed themselves to the labour of being ""real artists"".The songs on this new album sound like they came from the same batch of Big Star/XTC influenced Weezer outtakes as their last one. It sounds like a band trying really hard to be interesting because they think just writing good pop songs isn't enough. If they had the creativity to do anything more than write catchy modern pop-punk songs then it would be admirable to see them exercising it, but all I hear is an overly ambitious band who don't know their limits desperately straining for credibility."
3,saves the day,took like for ever to get here and the wrapping with all messed up so i couldent keep it mint cause it was all ripped so i just opened it to make it look better but the the cover was not too beat up
1,Mindlessly numb and not erotic,As an italian young woman I found this book to be one of the most boring books ever written. She is aself absorbed young woman who seems clueless and not like any of the young italians I know. Maybe the translation was done wrong or her juvenile thoughts were that badly written. I just can't believe that this book was so highly anticipated. Sex is happening at a younger age but you should skip this one if you are hoping to be titilated because you won't be. Me and my friends use her prose as jokes.
1,Can't Believe It's Real...,"Depending on what you read, this is either an ""actual"" or ""fictionalized"" diary of a teenager's sexploits. My vote falls for ""fictionalized"", and highly fictionalized at that. It reads to me exactly like a teenager's FANTASY of what having all these sexual experiences would be like.Badly written, this ""author"" needs more more experience before she publishes more books. If it weren't for the shock value of its subject, no one would ever read this."
2,Foul Language is not Erotic.,"Purchase for wife, way too gross, not believableand Foul language does not make for a story erotic, it just makes it vulgare"
3,Not really sure what to say...,"I read this book in a day-it is shorter than the books I usually read. I'm starting the 2nd book today, but at this point in time I just don't know what to say about '100 Strokes of the Brush Before Bed'. Its an odd story, full of violent sexual encounters, and told by a 16 year old girl. I've been a 16 year old girl, and I didn't do the things that Melissa does in this book. No, I was not a virgin at age 16; but the things that happen throughout this book just really shocked me. And, as a mother to a little girl, its scary too. I want to read the 2nd book before I completely throw my hands up and say that this book is trash-I'm hoping that the 2nd book will reveal the reasoning behind the first one. I guess I was hoping for a real story, and unfortunately, after completing this book, I was still left wondering what happens to Melissa. As I said, I'm hoping the 2nd book will answer that question..."
4,Surprised,I bought this book because it was recommended on Amazon and because I wanted a trashy book. I got exactly that BUT surprisingly it was more. The book gives the reader an insight on the workings of a promiscuous teenager's mind and her experimentation with sex in search of true love. I could not put this book down.
1,Not Groundbreaking,"I read this book while living in Italy, and when it came time to pack up, I simply threw it away to save space. I had seriously considered burning it publicly. It is my love of literature that compels me to do so. As a writer and a human, I have to say that the fact that this tripe is an international best seller is horrible. There are so many talented writers out there, fighting for publication, and yet the industry caters to shock value garbage like Melissa P.'s thinly veiled prepubescent diary as worthy of printing. Everyone over the age of 16 has been 16. We know all the angst. Just because this book involves a lot of sex doesn't make it erotica. It's a shame too because Mel P. does have a grasp of language and her metaphors are not bad. I'd consider reading something from her that was a polished work instead of her sodden journal entries. ps. Shock value in Italy= 10. Shock value in America=1. Teenage angst and self destruction in the name of ""love"" ain't nothin new."
1,"Trash, Nothing Else","This book is essentially a soft pornographic novel masquerading as something legitimate or substantive. It's essentially a catalogue of sexual deviations, positioned to sell to teenage audiences. Its publishers can be credited for marketing saavy, though one wonders how well they sleep at night knowing that they're hawking deviant sex to kids. Sadly, this ""book"" may be the first exposure that young readers have to sex in printed form. Any parent reading this book will be disturbed by this thought."
2,Not really worth it..,"i would hate to say anything to discourage young people who are interested in writing. however, having read this book after all the publicity it received from the media and the press, i have to confess that i was not satisfied with it at all as far as my expectations were concerned. i cannot say i've gotten anything out of it except the pity it left me with for all the things she had done to herself and/or let others to do to her if this book is based on the writer's own real experiences as said ofcourse. i have also bought and read the new one out by her named ""L'odore del tuo respiro"", which has become available this month where i live, and unfortunately, i don't think she is getting any better."
3,I expected more,How many languages was this published in? Perhaps they lost something in translation.
5,An erotic and lively read,"I picked up this book yesterday afternoon and finished it by midnight the same night. as a girl who is the same age as the author, i was absolutely entranced by her retelling of teenage years. she is eloquent, descriptive and passionate (above all) i could hardly put the book down. From the first paragraph, i was hooked. She captured the essence exactly of what i've been feeling, and what most adolecent girls feel at one point or another. not for those with a weak stomach."
2,100 Minutes of Reading Before Getting a Real Book,"I read/skimmed this book of ""erotica"" pretty quickly. The cover claimed it was a bestseller, worldwide sensation, etc. Actually, it's the story of a teenager who lets herself get used by a bunch of guys. It's not even erotic since all the sex is weird, bad and/or degrading. I couldn't figure out why she was interested after the first few bad encounters or what she hoped to gain. But, really, I didn't even care since the writing was so trite."
1,am I supposed to be impressed?,"This was basically just a string of sexual acts tied together with the emotional ramblings of a teenager. I saw no point in this book, I took nothing from it and indeed, I feel a bit violated but the utter stupid-ness of it.It's almost like she knew her diary would be published and did her best to fill it with pretentious prose. I couldn't shake the feeling that this was all made-up. It's not worth that price."
3,What Women Think,"This book, like many out today, offers a womans (or in this case a girl's) view of sex and sexuality. It makes for fun and stimulating reading. I enjoyed it. I am now reading Diary of a Sex Fiend: Girl with a One Track Mind. Same genre. Also sexy and fun to read."
3,Not very arousing for me,"I was not terribly impressed, but perhaps I am jaded. Everyone else apparently loved it.I've not read ""The Story of O"" or ""The Sexual Life of Catherine M"" which both received rave reviews as well, so I can't compare this to either of those."
2,Fairy tail???,"The newspaper's and magazine's reviews made me buy this book. I read fast...but it was nothing but bad sexual adventures of a very young girl. Maybe with a lot of imagination. It made me feel a little sick in the stomach. Not what i expected from all the reviews...happy end,like all fairy tails!!"
4,Williams vs. Ottman,"Ottman wrote a good score, incorporating much of the music ofJohn Williams. Having listened to both, I give Williams 5stars and Ottman 4. Ottman has written a good movie score,but John Williams soars above his colleague. I wish JohnWilliams had scored RETURNS--it would have made the moviephenomenal!"
5,Very Pleasantly Surprised!!!!,"I have been a huge John Williams fan for as long as I can remember. And to give an example of how big a fan I am, I am open enough to appreciate any variation, or interpretation of his music. I love hearing peoples different takes on his music. And one thing I love about Williams is he is constantly updating. It seems that when he makes a new recording of a previous recording, he has changed some of the instrumentation to keep it fresh sounding.I thouroughly enjoyed the movie, and I thought the music was beautiful. Sure, I was disappointed that Williams didn't continue the superman epic, but I don't think enough people are giving this score enough credit."
3,WOO HOO!!!,"This soundtrack is well done. I really enjoy listening to all the songs, but my fav. ones are #1, #6, and the last one. but its all good. I listened to it on my way to the movie with my friends and all of us wearing our superman shirts!! Well done Mr. Ottaman, maybe Williams can do the next one. That would be even better, even though this one is great!!! Go buy it huh!! I actually give it 4 1/2 stars not 3."
5,This is an excellent musical score,This is an excellent musical score by John Ottman. He really takes the listener on an emotional rollercoaster. I love the track Main Title Superman theme. This track makes me feel brave and fearless. Bank Job is a nice track that conveys a sense of evil wrongdoing. Little Secrets and Power of the Sun conveyed the emotion of wonder and discovery. I could feel the tension mounting on the track Rough Flight. I felt a feeling of dread listening to the track So Long Superman. Another good track is Not Like The Train Set. I felt a sense of danger and struggle here. I really liked the track Fly Away. It sounds so peaceful and romantic. Saving The World has a very heroic and noble feel to it. I enjoyed listening to this score very much.
4,This Soundtrack really Flys,IT MAY NOT BE JOHN WILLIAMS. BUT IT IS REAL CLOSE. GOOD MUSIC THAT REALLY MATCH WHAT'S ON THE FILM. I REALLY ENJOY THIS DISC. MONEY PUT IN TO GOOD USE. GET IT. YOU WILL ENJOY IT
2,Superman Returns Soundtrack,I didn't care for the sountrack nearly as much as I thought I would. It lacked the excitement of the movie.
3,Where is the rest?,Where is the Planet Krypton theme in the soundtrack? That is a must have for any Superman soundtrack. Other than that it was an ok soundtrack it didn't really pull me in. John Williams should have continued his role as the music composer he knows how to do it.
2,Standard Score,"If you want something to collect with your memorabilia for the movie, than by all means add this to your collection. But, in terms of having something memorable to listen, there is nothing here. This is a very paint-by-numbers score. Some basic themes with the standard dependency on some chorus to make it sound bigger than it is. This isn't a soundtrack that you'll want to listen to over and over for its own sake. It's very formulistic with no driver or passion. I haven't seen the movie yet to know how it fits in with the tone and mood of the film. On its own, it pales in comparison not to just William's majestic effort, but to standard film scores of the time."
3,From B.J. to his fans,"Having recently watched a B.J. Thomas concert here in Brazil, I can say this DVD is a faithful souvenir of the kind of show B.J. is doing these days. He should consider adding two female singers to make the band perfect, though. Apart from that, the musicians are competent and B.J.'s voice is still in top form. He talks a little bit with the audience between songs and shows a good sense of humor. I give this DVD only three stars for a number of reasons: it has only 10 songs, the sound is just passable by today's standards, the lighting is OK but could be better and there are no extras. All in all, this is a modest production that was released strictly for the fans. I myself being one, I can say I'm quite pleased to have this DVD in my collection, but I expected something a little more ambitious. If you're a fan like me, don't think twice: go for it. If you're not a fan, check his best compilations on Rhino and Varese, try to catch him on tour, become a fan, THEN buy this DVD!"
2,"Short and a poor ""concert""","My wife loves B.J.Thomas's music and I did before I saw this concert. The sound and video are poor and B.J. seems to have ""Lost it"" as it looks like he's performing before a small crowd of people sitting on benches. I think the best thing to do is to get his music and remember him when he was a great entertainer. What a waste of money!"
3,THE BEST OF BJ THOMAS LIVE VIDEO DVD REVIEW,I MUST GIVE THIS DVD ONLY 3 STARS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS THE LIGHTING REALLY COULD BE BETTER AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS JUST THE AVRAGE SO YOU CAN DECIDE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SPEND YOUR DOLLARS ON THIS LIVE DVD VIDEO YOU MAY WISH TO PURCHASE OTHER BJ THOMAS DVDS WHICH I MYSELF HAVE AND ENJOY THEM FOR VALU PRICE THAY ARE SOLD FOR.THIS VIDEO AGAIN I GIVE IT ONLY 3 STARS FOR ITS QUALITY.I'M ALMOST USUALLY RIGHT WHEN I VIEW IT THE FIRST TIME. SO I LET YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT BUYING AN ITEM THAT MAY NOT BE THAT GOOD FOR YOUR VALU DOLLARS YOU SPEND ON THE AVERAGE. C.LITZ ONLINE PRODUCTS REVIEWER.
5,Great Book! Read the real ones!,Strike Three was not published in 1990--but nearly 50 years ago.Great story of values and friendships.Buy the real Chip Hilton books.
2,Not Really Engaging,"Disappointing. The organization was poor, and the writer failed to profer anything new or creative.I was hoping to glean some new ideas to reference in a faculty development workshop, but found better material via random web searches."
5,The Best,"This book has revolutionized my teaching procedures. Bean shows us how to be more effective teachers without adding to the time we spend prepping and grading. The students are more engaged and writing better essays, and I am spending the same or less time preparing and grading. There are tips on everything from in-class exercises to constructing formal writing assignments. I recommend it to anyone teaching composition or any class with a critical thinking/writing component."
3,Basically High School activities,"I was suprised to find mostly high school activities in this book. After teaching for 20 years, I guess I have seen it all. However, the book is good for novice teachers."
4,not a '5'star,if all these songs were live this would be a '5'star release. the truth is that the intensity isn't here.
5,"If you don't like this cd, you're an idiot!!!","First of all, this cd was released in 1997. Therefore, don't be looking for the days of ""Suburban Rebels"" or the newer ""No Mercy"" stuff...This album was produced by Lars Frederiksen and Lars definitely put his stamp on it...Imagine lyrics from the ""Surburan Rebels"" era, with the sound of ""Keep the Faith"" and throw in some heavy power chords and double-stops you'd find on a Rancid album. Other than that, buy it. Its fun to listen to and every Oi fan should have it."
1,Go home and break up!,"This record is not good. Don't even think about buying it. Not only are the lyrics completely silly, but these guys are just trying to cash in the ""American"" Hardcore scene. I also met these guys on tour on various occasions, and hung out with them in pubs. They are not honorable or respectful on any measure of the Oi! scene. Bands like this make people hang up their boots, and call it a day."
4,Cafe Altura Organic Coffee review,"Like the previous reviewer, We bought this coffee as a result of the promotion and the free shipping. (very fast BTW) We've since ordered a generous amount prior to the closing of the promotion.We very much like the whole-bean breakfast blend. Brewing gives off a nice aroma, the beans are evenly roasted, and the taste is just right for us. We do recommend this organically grown coffee. It sure beats the national brands coffee from the supermarket."
2,upset,the cornor of the book was banded really bad. but I didn't return it since I need it for class soon.
4,Appropriate to Medicine Students,"For 2 decades I teached Cell Biology. I used Cell Biology's Alberts and Coleagues Book as most important reference book to my Medicine Students. Pollard&Earnshaw's Cell Biology is much complete as Alberts'one; however, it is more complete, and it guide more easy to Medical formation questions. I am very glad to know Pollard&Earnshaw's book and share the content to my students, and to provide better discussions."
2,distinctly hollow,"So far I have only read the first four stories of the book, but I have found them all practically unbearable. Though Eisenberg perfectly hones in on many abstract feelings, for the most part, I find the barely-there plots hollow and pointless. Maybe I just don't ""get"" it, but I can't relate to the shallow characters who seem to usually be spouting meaningless dialogue that leads to nothing. I read constantly and *rarely* come across anything I don't like. Disappointing."
4,Good Book!!,"This book contains a lot of things - conceptual and technical - we need to know about internet. Especially about business models and it's strategies. It is up to date and suits for business on internet nowadays. This book is not so difficult to understand, so to know more about business on the internet, this is the right book to read."
2,OMG!,These boots are very beautiful but this here momma has problems with such a high heel and no platform to balance.
1,It looks good but we can't use it even after visiting a service center,"I gave this stroller and the company 1 star because they don't have an option to give them 0 stars.We purchased this stroller from an on line source. The good news is we received it within 48 hours. The bad news is that it had a seriously warped rear wheel so we weren't able to use it without shaking our babies head violently. We visited the service center which was 1 1/2 hour ride by car. Not only did we receive the wrong replacement wheel, but it was also warped. I have gone on line and actually tried to purchase the correct replacement wheel, but for now we are waiting. We have owned the stroller for a month now and it is still just sitting collecting dust.Take my advice, skip Maclaren.RR in USA"
4,"A good companion guide, but not on its own...","This guide follows the vein of most Rough Guides, in that the information that the DO provide tends to be very in-depth (more though than other guides), however the scope of information tends to be somewhat lacking compared to others.The maps are not as good nor plentiful as other guides, however on the positive side the anecdotal nature of their reviews of locations, restaurants etc are very insightful.I'd suggest combining this book with another, and you'd be making the most of things by making the second book a Lonely Planet (say, Greece or Greek Islands) or the Greek Island Hopping 2000 from Thomas Cook."
1,Snuff porn,"Can't comment on the last 2 of the trilogy, couldn't get past the first one, one of the most godawful pieces of snuff porn ever filmed. Except for maybe The Passion of Christ."
1,"I can't believe how people are making this film sound artsy and ""disturbingly beautiful "" it's pure trash","All I have to say is come on people, this is a disgusting, horrible movie which came out of a very sick mind. It's grotesque and badly filmed and horribly acted with no plot or remotely interesting characters and not one redeeming quality.Of course it's my humble opinion, and I could not get through more than the first two segments because it sickened me so much. There is NOTHING beautiful to me about senseless self mutilation and murdering your little girl and wife. It's a sad state of the world when people think this obscene garbage is some sort of work of art.Rebel Without a Cause, now that is a work of art, and I am sure that Nicholas Ray, if he is still living, would be VERY dissapointed in what filth his daughter is involved in. That's my 2 cents for what it's worth."
3,Incorrect specs on Amazon?,"The actual connection on the iPAQ 211 requires a 5-pin, mini USB Type B connector. HP Support also looked at a cable and told me it is a 5-pin connector. The specs on Amazon.com appear to be incorrect when stating it is a 4-pin mini type B connector.I rate this item at 3-stars because Belkin cables sell for less."
3,Adequate but there's better.,"The color is ok, the zipper is ok, but the plastic ""memory"", so it's VERY difficult to keep the album open to adjust your disks without two hands...not so good."
5,Underappreciated is an understaement,"It never fails, whenever I play this record for anyone into early punk and hardcore they are blown away. Even more so because of the fact that they've never heard of Stranglehold. In the early 80's, Boston became known for some of the fastest hardcore to ever come out of the early 80's American Hardcore scene (SSD, Negative FX, Siege, etc,.). Stranglehold sounded nothing like other bands in the city, if anything they were America's answer to Stiff Little Fingers which is what most poeple I know compare them to. Stranglehold were a phenominal punk band and one of America's best, up there with Deak Kennedys, Black Flag, Minutemen, and Husker Du. Which makes me really sad to know that NOFX played a show in Boston years ago, told the kids how the best band to ever come out of their fair city was Stranglehold and the crowd just looked at each and shrugged, ""who?"". Incredible band, pick this up, they really were that good."
1,miscategorized,"Too much God talk. I was not expecting it to be so religious in nature. I was disappointed. I think there may be some good philosophy in there, but it is too mixed up with the author's religion. I was turned off immediately and couldn't get past the first chapter."
1,Not a good book about leverage,"Amazon should not link this poor substitue of a book about leverage with ""Leverage"" by Ron Pate. Avoid the mistake that I made."
5,"Great watch, great features","This is not a scuba diving watch but fun for snorkling and skin diving. The atomic watch updates well in the Washington, DC area. Mine updated the first night and I didn't even put it in a window as suggested. It has synchronized with NIST Ft. Collins every night since. Everything works as advertised."
2,Casio Sea pathfinder,"After I purchased it and read the instructions on the way to St. Thomas for vacation, I found out that there are three models of this watch. The version I purchased from you is supposed to be used for snorkeling only, not scuba diving (even though the watch is rated for 100meters). This was a real dissapointment for me The other two Pathfinder models mentioned in the manual can be used for scuba but I assume they are more expensive.I wish this had been mentioned in your description of this watch. Perhaps you will trade this out for a model that can be used for scuba. Dissapointed customer"
2,A Scholarly Book with a Very Biased View,"This book is worth reading for the author's presentation of material in archives not easily accessible to the public. The author's infatuation with Dorothy Day, the spiritual mother of the Catholic left, compromises her conclusions about Day. Thus, the book is deeply flawed, like most of the books written on Day by friends and co-workers. For a recent thoroughly researched book, see Dr. Carol Byrne's ""The Catholic Worker Movement (1933-1980): A Critical Analysis,"" available at amazon."
3,Dorothy was fasinating,"Day is a very interesting person, and her intense lifestyle lights up this book, creating a complex mixture of emotions."
4,BATS A.D are just as good as the original,"Ok, so if you've heard the Battalion Of Saints CD ""Death - R - Us"" you would've heard the first two tracks, ""Hell's Around The Next Corner"" and ""I'm Through With You"".Both songs are by Battalion Of Saints A.D, who is still the lead singer George Anthony, but with new members.They are still fast, still hard rocking punk songs but not exactly what you would've heard on the ""Second Coming"" LP (typical 80's Punk).""I'm Through With You"" is actually one of the best songs i've heard in a long time so I decided to pick up ""Cuts""This is a great cd.Members besides George is Terry Bones from many a Punk band, Ken Ortman and Mark Bender.Once again, good fast songs, a few guitar solo's (but not of the cheesy kind) and lots of agression.If you were a fan of the orginal band, i'd definitely pick this up, but even if you havent heard the original band, this would be a good place to start too.This album came out in 96, so I hope a new album is on it's way."
3,nice picture book with captions,"Book is a collection of picture postcards with brief captions for each one. The book follows along northern New England's railroads with pictures of stations, trains, and sometimes industries. Pictures are well reproduced, but are in black and white only. Captions are often too short but the format doesn't allow much room for elaboration. I liked it and hope the author will write one like this on soouthern New England."
2,Disappointed....,"I had my favorite small, metal, multi-sided shaker stolen from a gig, and have really been missing it. It was easily to hold, and while small, it's sound cut through, and I was often able to steer the rhythm section back to the groove, via my shaker. I had it so long I forgot the brand, and have been seeking a suitable replacement ever since. When I saw this one, I thought/hoped it would be an adequate replacement. Well, it's not.It's well-made, feels very comfortable, and has a nice sound, however, it certainly is not very bright, and wouldn't adequately cut through enough to replace my old one. It's not very much louder than a light, LP double-shaker I have, that I can use in very quiet situations, so it doesn't fill the bill. I also don't see the variance in sound it's claimed to offer, sorry, thus the low rating."
5,vivid imagery of an emerging place,"This compilation of hundreds of newspaper articles shows a small town at a point in its evolution. Berkeley, California is now a well known city throughout the USA, but it started out from humble beginnings. Each article reveals something different about its people, its society and movements and norms of the day.I expecially enjoyed items such as these:Chapter 18. Saloons and the Temparance Movement. ""Scientists. . .reported that daily indulgence in beer would result in a mental state akin to criminal insanity. . ."" Fascinating stuff.Then dive into Chapter 19. Milk, the Problem. In a creamery's advertisement one can learn ""Absolutely pure country milk and cream from healthy cows and fed in a well-ventilated and sanitary barn -- fed on only the best food obtainable.""Just slices of 100 year old life in Berkeley. . ."
4,"CLASSICALLY MODERN, SUBTLE AND FRESH","Shi, the fragrance by noted designer Alfred Sung, is reminiscent of his total design philosophy which is classically modern, whether it be clothing, watches or small leather goods. This fragrance is subtle, fresh with a blend of Water Lily and Fig Leaves. Complementing the initial impression is a composition of Orange Blossom and Frangipani, resulting in a soft femininescent.As one would expect the packaging, both bottle and box, is elegant simplicity. Utilizing three of nature's elements, wood, water, and metal, Sung has created a beautiful design. The bottle, a perfectly rounded glass rests on a dark wood base. On top of the cap is the Chinese symbol for water. Viewed as a whole, the bottle reminds one of a perfect drop of water.The box is a pale blue with the Chinese water symbol on the top panel.This fragrance would certainly be appropriate for day or evening.- Gail Cooke"
2,The Story of Oklahoma review,"I am a highschool student in Tulsa, OK and we are using this book for my Oklahoma History class. This book is rather boring and long. There aren't any pre-prepared workbooks or questions to go with it, so all you do is read and then take a test. To say the least I haven't learned very much from this book and I don't think many other highschool students have either. This book would be vastly improved if they chopped it up more into sections. Also if there were questions at the end of each chapter or section it would help."
5,An Awesome Translation that touches the soul,"Finally, a translation that is an awesome work, for those of you who haven't had a chance to study Greek New Testament or Hebrew OLD Testmaent, this is the ultimate Bible Reading Experience, which has been written in a very contemporary language, keeping in mind the essence and central thought of each verse that has been translated, Excellent explanations makes the Bible very easy to understand and meditate upon. A wonderful resource for everyone."
4,Good study Bible,The Open Bible is great in any translation. I don't think any other study Bibles even compare. I especially like the Cyclopedic index.
2,"Poor quality, flimsy and cheap. Avoid.",A very disappointing product from the fine name brand of Maxell. The flip-up cassette loader rarely closes properly; it constantly pops up in the middle of rewind. The device also makes a terrible screeching sound when rewinding. I'm not sure how gentle this rewinder is on delicate 8mm tape. I would seek a better product.
1,"Everything you need in a Journal, almost.","Lot a good things about Jeff's training program. I've found itvery helpfull over the last year so decided to pick up this journal. Big mistake. While it's got it's good points; I especially like the training programs, time predictors,sensible layout for daily entries, and lots of room in the back for notes, it has one fatal flaw. Contrary to the claim on the back cover that there are ""daily entries for one year"", you will find by the end of October you're using those empty note pages because you've run out of pre-printed log pages.No journal, no matter how good, that doesn't have space for a full year doesn't pass my minimums. The fact that the cover liesI find inexcusable. Get the Runner's World Training Diary, it's got most everything this book has plus a full year's worth of entry space, and it's [...] less [money]."
2,Jeff Galloway's Training Journal,"The format is good and there is plenty of space. The bad news is that there are not enough pages for an entire years' worth of entries -- that is really bad. So an otherwise good journal has a serious flaw. Moreover, the race prediction tables are both incomplete and inaccurate (including spelling errors -- maratime rather than marathon.) The book is more expensive than similar products."
4,Jeff Galloway's Training Journal,I like this training journal even though its designed for runnersand I am a fitness walker and relatively new competitive race-walker. This journal can also be used for walkers. I especially like the pages devoted to monitoring your resting heartrate when you first wake up in the morning for one year. It willoffer some indication of your aerobic fitness progress and if yourresting heart rate goes up 5% or more from one day to the next it usually means you are stressed or over training and need to take a day off from training and rest.Keep Walking or Running!Al Moore
3,"cute, but cheaply made","I bought this for my 4 year old daughter to wear for Halloween. It is a cute costume, but it is very cheaply made. The fabric is very thin, and isn't as sturdy as it looks in the picture. However, for [...], I guess you get waht you pay for. My daughter likes it though, which is all that matters, I suppose."
4,This video is not for beginners. Good none the less.,"To give this video a review I would have to start out by saying that it is better than most computer application videos I have seen. Most videos are too fast and long in words. This video was set at a pace that an amateur can follow. My major concern about the video was that it was to be at a beginner level. I feel that it was not, it was set at an amateur level and should be advertised as such. The only thing that I would add to this video is at each major learning point, a marker to tell the learner to stop the video and try out the new learning point. On a rating scale of 1:10 with 10 being the best, I would give this video a 7. I however will never suggest a video for anyone trying to learn the Internet. My suggestion is that each learner sits with someone and learns in a one on one situation."
1,"The video was outdated, to simplified for its target group.","I found the video to be geared towards beginners at the elementary level. I feel it was to simplified for the college level. I found it to be outdated, difficult to follow due to the fast pace of the information covered. I also found it to be rather lengthy, to the point of zoning. I would recommend it to a child, but not to an adult."
2,This video is for Beginners,"The video was informative but a little cheesey. A good thing about it is that the video gives some useful web sites. The length of it was a little too long. The opening idea of holding hands was a little childish and overall it was boring. The graphics on this video are weak, the pictures too small and the same for the text. In my opinion it was too basic. I would not recommend this video for the adult level audience."
3,"This video is generally mediocre, but good for a real novice","I felt that the video, ""The Internet for Beginners"", was in general the appropriate speed for a novice in the internet world. I think that it made it's point to that targeted audience, however, to anyone who has had any kind of experience with the World Wide Web, the video would be inappropriate. The length of the video was fine, 42 minutes did not seem too long, but I do not think that the makers used the time wisely. I do not feel that enough information was given as to the components of the computer that need to be utilized to ""surf the Web"". Far too often, the information given, which was meant to be noted, was taken off the screen too quickly. The video was easy to follow and the tone of the speakers' voice was appropriate, as well. In conclusion, I do recommend this video to anyone who has zero knowledge of the Web."
3,"I felt this video was pretty good, for the most part.","I am not a beginner on the internet, so I am a little biased, but I felt that the video was probably a very good overview of the internet and that someone who was watching it at home could easily follow along as long as they used the pause button on the VCR. I thought that the video was a little long - for me - and that it was, for the most part, interesting, especially to someone who is new to this. I thought it was pretty easy to follow, although the man spoke pretty quickly and the pages where they displayed web addresses moved too quickly. I would probably recommend this video to someone who is very new to the internet because I think that it would be pretty helpful, though they might even need another video in the series to orient people to other specific web services."
4,I found the video very insightful for the beginner.,"I thought that this video really targetted the beginner audience. Even though I have used the internet before, I found that the video gave me an understandable explaination as to how the internet works; things I had not understood or even heard of before viewing this video. Certain areas of the video were not as interesting as others, but I found it to be very helpful, and provide me with a better understanding of how the internet works!"
3,It is good explanation for those who don't know much,"I thought this video explained things pretty good for those who know nothing about internet. It did however go through information at a rather fast pace. Also the images cold have been bigger in the screen for better viewing. The length of the video is appropriate for beginners and is eay to folow. All in all the video is best suited for those who know very little about the internet, otherwise, to those who do know about it, it can be a little on the boring side."
3,"Infromational, yet dry!","This video covers the basis of the use on the Internet. The speaker goes over things to fast and if you want to write something down you better be quick, or have your remote in hand to pause and rewind. The writting on some screens is awfully small, so have your glasses handy if need be. The video is easy to follow and is aimed at ""begginers""!!"
4,A good video for the inexperienced internet user,"I think this is an appropriate video for beginners. Although I don't consider myself a beginner, there were somethings that I learned from the video. I think the video was a good length, because it covered a lot of material in a short time. At times it moved too fast to write things down. The video would be best viewed while sitting in front of a computer that way the viewer can experiment and use hands on learning. Although it is dated, I believe this is a good video for someone who is new to the internet. It is also appropriate for a person that has a fear of computers and the internet."
3,"The video was pretty good, gets you started on the internet",Video was good. Easy to follow and understand. Information is very valuable. Give it 3 stars
4,Autobiography Through Bibliography,"This is an introduction to the books that most shaped Colin Wilson's ideas. And it is somewhat surprising - not every book on this list is an ""outsider"" book. One of the interesting things about this book is that it is autobiography through bibliography. Wilson chronologically traces his personal development and the development of his thought through the books that most influenced him - from his earliest experience with reading to the present. And some of the choices-like Edgar Rice Burroughs and Arthur Conan Doyle--are surprising.Also interesting is Wilson's defense of his various tastes. It's a rare treat when someone shares their person aesthetic preferences, and Wilson, as a lifetime reader, does this well. For one example, he describes how his former love for G.B. Shaw's plays faded as he got older.For fans of Wilson, this is a welcome insight to how his ideas developed."
1,Vanity Press schlock,"Save your money.This looks like a book that is going to be an independent review of the scandal-ridden Covenant House charity, but it's really a Covenant House-commissioned work that feebly attempts to rewrite that charity's history, and it's scandal-filled past.Although it was printed afterward, this book completely ignores the sexual abuse of teenage boy committed by former Covenant House executive Bruce Harris during Sr. Mary Rose McGeady's tenure as President of Covenant House, and of how that sexual abuse continued into current Covenant House Sr. Patricia Cruise's term. It breezes by the millions of benefactor dollars that have gone missing.If you want to read Covenant House public relations material, get on their mailing list. If you want to waste your money, buy this book."
3,Packaging was terrible,"I was very disappointed with how this product was packaged. The pendulum rod was bent in half so that it would fit in the small box it was shipped in. Also, the two clock parts that hold the hands were pretruding through the box. Can't get the part to work now. Key won't turn to wind it. :-("
2,incomplete.... and not extensive enough,"Some names are inexplicably absent (Mark Charig comes to mind), ans it seems that all entries are allocated a ceertain amountof lines, regardless of the extent of the careeer and oeuvre and rthere is no list of essential works or discography.... Indeed, is it normal that Dave Holland gets the same amount of lines (between 10 & 20) as some totally obscure trombonist like Chris Mumford?? A rather disappointing book, that is neither exhaustive, nor extensive, that seems little more than a detailed phonebook.Can't understand this book is its second edition (and re-writing) and still presents such flaws."
2,Same old stuff with a twist,"Nothing new here. I find it puzzling that someone with no formal education in exercise and/or nutrition can command 10K per week for nothing more than a different approach to the same old thing. That is, calories in vs. calories out."
1,Save Your Time & Money,"This book is very boring and noting new, just some basic advice on eating well and exercise that written in a different way. Jim refers to himself as a fitness/nutrition guru, yet he hold no formal education or training in exercise. He is not certified by any of the major and accredited trainer certification organizations. He also love to go on-and-on that holds a business degree from Wharton School of Business, which is great but really irelivent. A quality fitness trainer should be certified by a well respected and accredited organization, and hold a degree in exercise science, human movement, kinesiology or physical education."
5,This is a Winner!,"I bought this book right after seeing Jim Karas on Good Morning America with Diane Sawyer. She looks amazing and has lost over twenty five pounds with Karas' plan. Once I started reading it, I couldn't stop. I have struggled with weight all my life and, for the first time in 52 years, have finally found a book that, at times, I felt spoke right to me. Yes, calories count. Yes, strength and resistance training is the answer. I always hated the treadmill, so when he said to ""throw it out"" I was inspired. I bought the SPRI tubing he recommends and found the exercise program easy to execute and it really produced results. I am down almost 30 pounds and my clothes are virtually falling off of me.Do yourself a favor. Buy this book and throw all your other weight loss books out. This is a winner!"
2,"Common sense, new positioning","The weight-loss strategies presented in this book are simple, straightforward and most importantly, nothing but common sense!! You don't need this book to help you lose weight--you can do it on your own after some thoughtful reflection of what is necessary to achieve your goals. For those individuals who truly need things to be positioned in the style of business strategizing and so on in order for them to make an impact, then ok, go for it, whatever it takes. For everyone else, don't waste the time sitting and reading this book, start moving instead!"
5,Jim Karas' Knows His Stuff! The ONLY Solution to Weight Loss,"I've personally met Jim and he is refreshingly on of the most genuine, caring, and honest people I've ever met. He is truly an inspiration.Both of his books offer some tough advice about weight loss (no gimmicks here!) His solution is the only to succeeding at long-term weight loss. Jim is constantly informed of new research and incorporates it into his writings. He is a contributing editor for Good Housekeeping magazine.A tip I would give readers: Carry this book with you as if it were your Bible. I'll be honest, I tried once and failed. But I revisited the book and found it motivating once again. Now I re-read passages daily to keep me going! It works!!!! Don't fall for gimmicks and fad diets. The truth is right here! You will never need another source for weight loss.I highly recommend you buy both of Jim's books: Business Plan for the Body and Flip the Switch. Both offer invaluable information."
1,still waiting,"I have been waiting since Jan. 3rd for this book to arrive. It is now March 18th. That would be well over 3 months, which is pretty ridiculous."
5,Tremendous,"Jim Karas' executive approach to weight loss is a winner, which helped me to downsize my gut and will hopefully help my wife to fire her a**."
2,Not that great...seen better,"This book really was not that great, read some of it and sold it. Not a keeper. I have seen better for instance Body for Life is much better. Just didn't give me the ""plan"" I was looking for. Kinda of lacking in content and same old stuff as other ""diet"" books."
2,Don't bother,"I enjoy a lot of exercise and eat well, but I thought I would brush up on my knowledge and remotivate to do more exercise than I already do - I selected this book as the BP concept seemed interesting. I put the book down after about 15 pages - for good. It seemed very apparent to me that the author has some serious mental issues with people who are overweight, and boy, he doesn't let you forget it! I did read that he was overweight himself at one point and he developed low self esteem as a result of this; well, it certainly shows. This book is extremely condescending - if you are an intelligent, positive individual, then this book isn't for you. If you want to be indoctrinated into the ""thin is in"" mantra, by all means, buy my copy (please!)."
1,The Business Plan for the Body,"It was easy to tell that this book was written by a personal trainer instead of a professional writer. This book was not literature by any means. Although, Mr. Karas offers many great pointers about changing your lifestyle and learning how to manage your ""body business"" he fails to offer real motivation. In addition, he mentions his ...fees far to often and references a web site that is not operational. If a friend asked me to lend this book, I would gladly give it to them permanently."
2,"Some good info, but bus. plan metaphor is tiresome","This book contains good basics (e.g. calories in vs. calories out). It helps you calculate your calorie expenditure and figure out how much you can eat. The information seems sound. I have two main objections to the book. First, he spends a lot of time explaining business terminology and cramming dieting into a business model framework. If you have even a rudimentary knowledge of business terms, you quickly get tired of his long explanations. Second, his exercise routines seem designed primarily to drive sales of the exercise equipment he shows in the book. This is a good business plan for his wallet. I think the book would have been better if he had offered weight exercises that did not depend on his special equipment."
3,Has some good points...,"I would actually rate this book about 3 1/2 stars. I felt the author went way overboard with the business analogies and terminology and I grew quite tired of that aspect of the book. I felt that the overall ideas in the book--calories out vs. calories in and that you must use weight training if you want to maintain permanent weight loss--were solid ideas that should be known by anyone attempting to lose weight and stop the yo-yo dieting. I found the exercise portion of the book to be a bit too simplistic and didn't stress the use of free weights enough, but if you have never attempted weight training as part of your exercise program then it might be a good starting point for you."
4,Good motivational message plus solid information,"The nutrition, exercise and diet info is solid, well-researched and up to date with the latest info (even suggesting such tidbits as drinking green tea with each meal to burn an extra 50 calories more a day). The author also looks at the latest diet fads and reveals the myths behind the worst of them. The motivational messages are (no surprise) written from a ""business plan"" point of view but should work for those who need that daily affirmation of their ""game plan"" to keep them on track or for those who need a tough love approach to stay on track. The author's no nonsense, pull no punches style may be just the thing for some reluctant wanna-be fitness buffs. If that fits your profile, this is just the book for you. Otherwise, you'll find the same basic info in other books out there."
5,Well written and very understandable,"I was given this book to read by my doctor and after having it just for a few days, I went out and bought my own. It was easy to read and very well written. Jim explains things so anyone can understand it. I continue to go back to the book as I lose weight to keep on track. He has given me a better understanding as to what it all means. I've been on a diet for about 5 weeks and I have lost 20 lbs. I'm so excited that I finally found someone who writes with me in mind. I have recommended this book to many people and they all have liked it too.Thanks Jim for helping me start to become the weight I want to be."
1,Arrived with a hole in it,Item arrived with a hole in it. annoying to have to go through the process of returning it. Also did not seem very durable.
4,"useful, but...","This is very useful if you are taking Employment Discrimination using the textbook it is keyed to. HOWEVER, it is not updated to the most recent version of the textbook, so some things are out of order and others cases have been deleted. That said, if you are using it as a supplement and not a replacement for the class reading, it is still useful."
1,Why?,"Again one must ask ""Why does this guy bother writing when he could be breaking down boxes in a hot, sweaty warehouse and making a REAL contribution?"" Allen pulls out the most banal tidbits of information and rubs his nose sagaciously as he takes yet another public domain work, slaps some worthless adjectives on it, and pawns it off as his own."
1,Ugh,"I should've listened to the two honest reviewers here and NEVER have bought this book (or the other two offerend by Greenfield.) The ""scholarship"" in this work consists of poor photocopies of irrelevant documents and receipts. Boring, boring, boring.... A real snoozer."
1,drivel,"Horrible. Terrible. Not good at all! Simply another rip-off only this time, instead of the dead hand of Charles S. Jones, Greenfield has elected to rip-off John Yarker."
5,A Story of Moving Beyond,"Natural Disasters is a compelling read that will keep you flipping pages and wanting more. As parallels between physical, emotional, and natural disasters are drawn, the reader finds an immense emotional connection with the protagonist and her struggles throughout the novel. I highly recommend this to anyone in search of a story about moving beyond tragedy and learning to rebuild from the rubble."
5,A very emotional and thought-provoking book!,"This book has a story to tell, and the author does it beautifully. I could hardly put it down, The characters were well thought out, and the story flowed well."
5,good introduction to watercolor techniques and materials,"I found this book very helpful -- a good introductory book on water color techniques and products. Lots of detail on the different materials and tools used in watercolor (paper type, brushes, paints, misc). The author discusses the uses of each and which products and brands he finds most useful/of the best quality. The author also discusses different techniques (with examples). The book is in color and the step-by-step instruction is useful for beginners or those of us that are a bit rusty. This book will also be useful for people that have never taken an art class as there is background info as well (the color wheel, values, etc.)."
2,Don't waste your money,Not enough information to warrant you buying this watercolor book. You can select many more that give much better instruction and more technical advice. Not sure who is writing these other reviews but beware of this one. Pleased to be able to share!
4,An opportunity to explore,"This is a slower practice that tends to target the lower body and has quite a few twisting postures in it. You could say the slower pace makes things easier, but you could also see it as a chance to fall deeper into your poses.There are some poses I don't do on the ball, such as Eagle, Temple, Fan and Warrior 3. If you ever feel the ball isn't working for you, simply roll it aside and grab it again when you need it. Remember: it's an accessory, not a necessity.Sara's right when she says that using the ball might allow someone to get into postures they normally would not be able to get into without its support. But what I personally enjoy about occasionally doing yoga with the ball is that it gives me an opportunity to explore certain poses differently."
4,Great for All Levels,"I have many different yoga dvds, including super advanced and this has a definite use for my practice. the exercise ball helps you to further identify areas of tightness and weakness that you might not be aware of when performing power yoga type practices. Some of the bonus clips give you preps for handstand and scorpion pose that are great for the lower back. I hope that the instructor produces another video in this series."
2,not the size indicated,"I was pleased with the quality and construction of this loaf pan, but disappointed with the size. They indicated it would be 9 x 5 in. It was 9 in. long, but the usable width was more like 3 in. I have another silicone loaf pan from another manufacturer. The problem with that one is that it bows out on the sides, so I was hoping this design would correct that problem. It would have but the size was too small for my purposes."
4,good for beginners,"great for the price, and great for beginners. there are better acoustic guitars out there, but this is good for its price range."
2,Don't expect much.,"I didn't expect much for the price - and I was still disappointed. Item was purchased as a Christmas gift for my 12 y/o daughter, who is a beginner. I figured as a beginner, we'd start out with something inexpensive - and in her favorite color - blue. The construction and materials for this guitar are very poor. I'm not a player, so I can't say much for the sound or how well it stays tuned. The appearance is marginal at best. It's as if they put it into the included case before the finish was completely dry. The case seemed to stick to the body of the guitar. I'll have to clean it before it goes under the tree. I am almost embarrassed to give it to her.Another caution - the guitar arrived in it's box - and was marked in clear, bold easy-to-read letters Electric Acoustic Guitar. So, be forewarned if you are ordering it as a gift for someone who lives in your household."
1,card reader,this item is an mp3 player without out memory included which means you need to buy the memory which holds the music so can it truly be called an mp3 player...
1,"Seeing the Dead, Talking with Spirits","Reading this book was a very painful experience. I was very disappointed. I bought it mainly because of the title and that it was endorsed by Robert Moss and John Perkins (I wonder now if they even read this book). While there were a few (and I mean a few) parts that I found somewhat interesting they were few and far between. I quickly tired of listening to the authors' infatuation with one of her teachers, praising him when all went well and then sulking if he didn't pay enough attention. I felt I was reading a book about a school girls crush.I found the book very self centered and had little to do with shamanic healing. Save your money....I wish I had."
4,Excellent dried porcinis for the price,"I have been ordering these for a couple of years now, and have yet to find a better deal on dried porcinis. These ones are the ""middle"" grade; I like them enough that I have not been tempted to try the higher grade. As with all other dried porcinis I have tried, both stems and caps are included. For those of us who can't stroll down to the local store and buy fresh ones (and I expect there are many of you out there), I think these are a good way to go."
5,great value,The mushroom pieces are large and very aromatic. Great product at a great price. The product is fresh and well packaged.
5,wonderfully comprehensive!,"The perfect foundation for onsite massage treatement, this volume is a great resource. Highly recomended."
3,message book,"This book is very involved and informational. It will take me many hours to investigate it and practice the reccomendations. It is a little too heavy for a first time massage user. I need a more simple instructional book, but this book would do for intermediate."
4,an uncanny story of possession and the past,"The story is set in Australia, at a place where many decades ago Aborigines were massacred. Everything seems to have been forgotten, until Baily's bones are dug up. A boy becomes possessed, to the shock of his two siblings, and some people try to reenact the past. A wonderful story for young people as well as adults."
2,BEST ACTRESS...lesser movies,"Bette Davis is my favorite actress so usually I'm biased about buying her movies. However, I do not recommend watching her movies that were made before Jezebel, including Of Human Bondage and Hell's House. She was still a wonderful actress in that early period, but if you want to see a good movie with good quality and plot line, go get her later works:Now, Voyager; Deception; The Letter; Dark Victory; All This and Heaven Too; Watch on the Rhine; All About Eve; The Nanny; Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte; or the all out crazy Bette movie-Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"
5,If I could I'd give this 8 1/2 stars.,An excellent discourse on Fellini's development as a director and his creative process. Bondanella knew Fellini personally and saved many items revealing the interworkings of Fellini's creativity that would have otherwise been destroyed by Fellini himself. Recommended to any and all film students or film buffs.
2,Disappointed...,"I thought it was a collection of original Japanese designs. The editor apparently took it upon herself to redraw them, and that is what's contained herein. The designs end up diminished, weaker than the traditional crisp oriental linework. I would return it if possible. Very disappointed."
3,a decent reference for tattooing,"If quanity and quick reference for tattooing is what you're looking for, look no further. Be warned though the illustrations are pretty weak in a lot of areas, so be ready to redraw! But there are tons of floral designs (especially lotus) and simple designs that are invaluable for a tattooer. So as far as an excellent source on traditional japanese art it is not, but it could be handy in the shop."
5,Heavenly Handmade Soap,"I have been using Chandrika soap for more than 20 years. At one point, during that bleak historical period known as ""pre-Internet,"" I was living in a small town and had to order an absurdly large amount (60 or 80 bars) from a distributor to have any at all. This is the only soap that I can use on my back to prevent itching, acne, and exzema. It is kind to my face, too. If you have delicate or problem skin, this may be the solution for you."
1,What is it?,"I understand it contains ""caustic soda"". I give it one star because it is so hard to find the ingredients."
3,Recommended,"The book is not the best book on Javascript, but it is very helpful. I'm not sure why someone gives this book one star and claims that it is only good for a fireplace. Definitley, the problem is not with the book !!."
2,Ironic,"I find it difficult to believe that someone who endorses 9-11 conspiracy theories (see the authors review of ""9-11 Mysteries"" on December 7th) could be viewed as an authority on intelligence issues. If he ever had any credibility in the field, he's long since gone over the deep end.Ironically, its people like him and his ilk, who believe a neconservative/Israeli conspiracy was behind the destruction of the twin towers, that best undermine the central premise of his book: that ordinary citizens need to take a greater role in intelligence. If 9-11 conspiracy theories are the sort of mind-numbingly stupid, paranoid output that can be expected from the sort of amatuer intelligence agents Steele wishes for, I'd prefer to leave it to professionals."
3,Needs assembly and design defect,"Only the drawer sides are solid wood; the rest is painted/veneered chipboard. The product needs assembly - straightforward but takes time. The design and parts do not provide for a horizontal spacer bar at the rear of the dresser in the middle section. In the dresser I received, the two side sections bowed in slightly at the center and the four center drawers would not slide all the way back. I cut a piece of wood to length and wedged it at the rear of the middle section and that cured the problem. The dresser looks nice, is reasonably sturdy, and my daughter has not complained."
2,Ugh......,"Okay, I'm going to be brutally honest. I didn't like this book very much. I expected it to be a lot better. We had to read it in 6th grade, and my teacher said it was really good. Obviously we have very different tastes. I found myself drudging through the chapters. It was veeerrrryy boring and confusing. Virginia Hamilton did not describe what was going on very well, so I had a difficult time picturing the story. And I HATED Thomas!! He just seemed convieniantly(sp?) smart so the plot(or what was left of it) could flow more easily. Ehh maybe I'm being a bit harsh, perhaps I just don't like this genre. But I can't recommend it, I'm sorry."
3,Mystery? Or.......Not Completely?!,"This book started out kind of slow. The first couple of paragraphs were just about Thomas and his family while they are on their way to the House of Dies Drear. Later, when they got to the ""Haunted House"", it starts to get more exciting. It was getting REALLY exciting. At the end of the book, it was a REALLY disappointing end. They mentioned a certain trunk and make it seem all mysterious and then they don't say anything else about it and we didn't have any idea that there was a sequal. So, I think that it could have had a bit more ""undisappointing"" end. I read this book with my sixth grade class and other than what I've mentioned, it was great!"
5,SUPER MYSTERIOUS BOOK,The House of Dies Drear is a freaky book but I liked it a lot .I thought Thomas was very brave when he pushed the button by the front door and when he went through the tunnels.
1,"Scary (""ahhhh"")","I would really like to rate this book with zero stars, but that wasn't a choice. Reading was usually one of my favorite things to do...until now. When I open this book it's like I'm about to meet a horror. The worst part about it is that I'm forced to read it as a school assignment. It talks about the devil and all sorts of things I don't want to hear about. There's almost no detail and there's not really much of an end. The title doesn't sound like the book will be too bad, but in reality it's terrible. It's not at all appropriate for fourth graders (which is the grade I'm in) and it shouldn't be assigned to them. It has a lot of scary things in it that are not appropriate for fourth graders. I'm surprised that it is supposed to be for 9-12 year olds because it should be for much older kids."
2,A bit dull...,"After reading the synopsis, I was quite eager to read this book, but I am sad to say it was a bit disappointing. To begin, the plot unfolds very slowly (all the events in the book take place within a couple of days) and lacks any interesting twists or turns. A few parts can seem somewhat engaging, but you quickly lose interest because of the laggard pace. Overall, it was a bit dull, but did provide some interesting details about life around the time of the Civil War."
1,Dies Drear,"I had very high expectations for this book because of all the good comments I heard about it. After I read it, I was VERY disappointed.It was dull and very slow. I had no fun reading it at all. I do not reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys fast-paced and exciting books. It was supposed to be a horror story but turned out to be the opposite."
1,Die Drear,"I WOULD have made is 0 stars...but there was no choice for that. I have an assignment about this book, and it's dull, and to me, pointless. My whole group hates it, and the teacher refuses to choose another (I basically think that he has no other books to choose from, because our 5th grade books are dull and pointless, well, except two we've read). There is no real ending, it's made me almost fall asleep several times, and it is written in a form that is awkward and confusing. Some parts are 'dead ends' and don't make any sense. I recommend this: DO NOT EVER READ IT. It's my sincere guesture that you do not purchase it either."
1,"Actually , negative 22222555562677889055 stars",This book was horrible!!!! It made no sense whatsoever!!! I just don't get how I can read novels about the Civil War and Queen Elizabeth the 1 and not be able to understand this childrens book!!!!
1,......................,.............Ohh sorry i fell asleep again this book is just so boring it is insane its way to boring 2 even think about reading my advice is NEVER READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! im in (...)and i was forced to read it my eyes were almost permenttaly shut after reading
2,THE BOOK OF DIES DREAR IS NOT AN EXCITING BOOK,I do not recommend this book because it does not have any action in it. I like books that have action in them . Also because it does not get to the point until the Chapter 5. I like books to get to the point so I do not get bored.
2,Not the best,When I first read this book I expected it to be exciting. WRONG. At first it seemed like there were going to be ghosts. The way Virginia writes it is confusing. Some things dont even make since.This book to me was very boring and dull. I hated it most things arent explained in the end.
3,Not too shabby!,"Although this book had a lot of dry areas, it was rather good. With a good plot and a surprise ending, it deserves 3 stars. It starts off kind of slow but it gradually gets more interesting. It has wonderful, vivid descriptions of the surroudings and it is a shame not to read it."
3,House of Dies Drear,This book drags out in the begining and then in the middle its pretty good and makes you think whats gonna happen next. Then you think towrds the end that its gonna be so good and then its like there sitting there and it ends. It dissapoints me a lot. Other than that it's a really good book.
2,This book was horrible.,"The book was a crime against the sanctity of novels. My child, who was currently in the fifth grade was forced to read this book for his reading class. He constantly came to me complaining about not understanding it, so I was forced to have to read it for him. It was terrible. It was written for fifth graders, or so it says, but I do not think it was meant for them in one bit. His teacher tries to introduce symbolism far too quickly to the children by giving them this book to read that says it is for fifth graders. Please inform teachers that this book is for students who are older. Other than that, the book was alright. Nothing special. Thank you."
2,"House of Cheesy, 1-Dimensional Over-Writing","I completely and totally dislike The House of Dies Drear. The characters, had no depth, and were one-dimensional, the dialogue was stiff, and robot-like, and there was nothing in the book that I could relate to. I consider the book to be quite anti-climactic, lacking a major turning point in which the readers are supposed to be enthralled in. It had no twists, about two cliff-hangers, and was completely predictable. It was, in fact, probably one of the worst books that I have ever read. On a scale of five, I'd have to rate it a two, because as I said, it did have a couple of cheesy cliffhangers, but nothing that left me satisfied with the book that I have read."
3,The House of Dies Drear,"I read a book about The House of Dies Drear. If I had to rate it, it would be a 3 out of 5 because of the many details about its character and settings. It describes the details very well, for example, its description of how the house looked like it was a monster or how Mr. Pluto was an old wrinkled man. The characters where especially described by how they felt. You understood how Thomas felt when his dad screamed at him for looking through his stuff. He felt sad when his dad screamed at him. I also think that the setting is well described. The descriptions of the veranda, eaves, and pillars were good. The only reason I didn't like the book was because some of the ""ghosts"" that were in the house weren't described very well compared to the other characters. The character that I was least interested in was the mom because she barely spoke in the book."
4,The House of Dies Drear,"I loved The House of Dies Drear book.I read this year in reading. Thomas, Mac, Pesty, Billy, and Buster are the kids in this story. In the book Pesty is my favorite charater."
4,"Father, I'm scared...","You walk throught the woods, somebody is following you. The devil starts to chase you. You will never see light again but your father's hope and faith help you find the truth about sellah, which means freedom to us, but to the slaves, it means a new live from help of sellah, Dies Drear. -Lavender"
4,Great learning adventure,I enjoyed reading this book. I learned about the underground railroad while being drawn into the mystery of this story. The characters are quite real and believable. The story kept drawing me back to it until I finished it. Good descriptions made it easy to picture the setting. I would definitely recommend this book.
1,House of Dieing from Boredom,"Ask any teacher you know and they'll tell you how amazing the book- The House of Dies Drear is. But truthfully I would'nt recomend this book to anyone. The plot line may entice you to actually pick up this book and read it, but after the first page you'll absolutely die of boredom. It's a hard read with way too much description. To make matters worse, it's in 3rd person narrative. We have just finished reading this book in my class and not one kid in the whole room liked it. Adults have mostly written reviews for this book and raved about it; adults aren't always right. The bottom line is that adults will love this book but kids will despise it. Don't buy this book! Save your money!"
2,The House of Dies Drear is booorring!,"The House of Dies Drear was the most boring book I have ever read. It had no action. I only have one word to say, LAME!!There were some parts that got interesting, but got boring afterwards. I really would not recommend it."
5,GREAT!,This book was great! I had to read it for school and for 2 months i kept bugging my teacher! Can we read Dies Drear? i said! We finally started and we got assigned a chapter a night! I always asked if i could read more than one chapter! I love this book! all you mystery fans READ THIS!
5,The House of Dies Drear,A mystery with twists and turns and ... you need to read it rather than this review. Two thumbs up!The House of Dies Drear
4,The greatest and scariest book of slaves,"I did like the book ,but I like the movie more because it was scarier .I like the house because it was tall and had hidden tunnels .And I like it because of all the gold and silver they had hidden in a cave so nobody could find it and take it.And my favorite part of the story was when they planed to scare the Darrows because they wanted to steal the treasure that was hidden in the cave for a long time and Mr.Small and his family and the son of Mr.Pluto and a girl dressed up like the slaves that had escape and like Dies Drear so at the end of the story the Darrows din'd get to steal the gold because they were cscared off the property."
2,A BORING BOOK,"THE BOOK, THE HOUSE OF DIES DREAR, ISN'T THAT GOOD.THERE ISN'T MUCH EXCITEMENT IN THE STORY.IT IS JUST A MYSTERY. PEOPLE WHO LIKE MYSTERIES SHOULD READ IT. I DIDN'T LIKE IT ONE BIT."
2,The House of Dies Drear Was an Okay Book.,"In my opinion I thought parts of the book were interesting, then other parts weren't so interesting. Some of the chapters in theHouse of Dies Drear were a little bit confusing and scary. I thought that the end of the story was a bad ending because Virginia Hamilton never solved the problem. Over all I thought it wasn't the best book.-Isabella L."
4,Scary At First,"Thsi book started out (first 80 pages or so) being VERY creepy and scary--not for younger readers. But then it changes and becomes a mystery. It is not until page 100 or so that we discover the main characters are Black, and this really impacts the story about ex-slaves and the Underground Railroad. It is supposed to be a book that tells us about slavery and the Underground Railroad, and is used in classrooms as a reading book with social studies tie-ins -- but NO -- I do not think it does this well at all. It is unclear what is happening or who is doing what until nearly the end, and the history is all mixed up with the fiction. This book will scare kids under 10, and some older ones too. I am more confused about the role of the Underground Railroad and Dies Drear now than before I read the book."
2,My Review,Thomas is moving to Ohio he is moving into an old under ground railroad station. This house was once owned by Mr. dies drear. he is said to haunt the huse when thomas first arives he notices how dark and gray it seems annd even more creeply his brothers start crying the minute they touch the steps. so his parents huridly take them into the house.
1,The bottle cap doesn't open properly,I bought this product as a gift but luckily checked the bottle beforehand. The lotion dispenser is stuck in the bottle cap. You cannot even dispense lotion out of the bottle. This seems to be a design flaw. Will be returning the item.
5,great guide to fitness & life,"so many books out there rehash the basics: what exercises to do, how long to rest, what to eat..blah blah blah. this book covers these topics soundly - better than any i've come across - but does so much more. every week of the ten week program - geared for 3 different training levels - includes a section on motivation, how to resist the temptation to skip the gym and/or eating, how to build your will power and how to truly enjoy a healthy lifestyle. if you follow the 10 week program, your body and life will benefit immeasureably. the only downfall was that he doesn't show how to perform a couple of the exercises listed."
1,Does not play.,"Sorry to say, I never got to watch it because it doesn't play on either of our VCR's. Didn't pay that much so I guess it's no big deal."
5,Guaranteed to Grow - and they Do.,"I haven't planted these yet as I am in Florida. All other Ferry Morse seeds purchased and planted ( organic mustard greens, organic turnip greens, organic cucumber and organic beet) GROW!I have been vegetable gardening for 40 years or so....and this is far and away the best seed brand I have ever purchased."
5,Cuba libre,"Two years ago my back started bothering me. My right foot goes to sleep and I can'twalk or stand as I used to do. I received a catalog from ""Road Scholar"" [aka Elder Hostal] with international tours they provide. Cuba seemed strange, slightly sinister and how could I resist? The information provided stated that while Cuba was rich in history, art and museums, it was poor in public benches. And so it is! I sent for this cane. I'm so glad I brought it on my Cuban adventure. As a cane it provides a 3-clack gait [you have to experience it to see what I mean, the 3 prongs are uneven but provide a rolling motion as one is propelled along]. As a chair, you straddle the seat and balance yourself in a fairly comfortable position. Now I'm 70 years old and 200 pounds and it supported me well enough throughout the trip. I would definitely recommend the chair and Road Scholar as well [roadscholar.org]."
1,DANGEROUS-METAL FAILURE-BREAKS EASILY!!!,"BUYER BEWARE--POOR METAL QUALITY CAUSES SUDDEN DANGEROUS SNAPPING OF A LEG THAT THROWS YOU TO THE FLOOR AND CAUSES INJURY! I ASKED AMAZON TO STOP SELLING THIS ITEM MONTHS AGO, BUT THEY'RE STILL SELLING IT!!"
4,Very useful,"Spouse has mobility issues, and this product allowed him to walk around Yosemite and still be able to rest as needed. It's unobtrusive and many people liked it, asked where we got it."
5,The Right Seat,"I had immediate need for a cane/seat; and not finding anything at a local store, I chose to shop online. There were so many choices and so many prices that making a choice was really stressful; but the gods were with me. This seat is nice looking and sturdy. I probably chose it because of its adjustable height, which is a nice feature.Last week, I saw someone with one of the choices I had considered and I knew immediately I was happy I had made the choice I did-even if I spent a few-not many-dollars more. Theirs looked small, cheap, and not very sturdy.Having shopped Amazon before I felt confident in purchasing a product offered by them and took advantage of their speedy delivery feature."
2,Handy if you can sit and stand without assistance,"I got this to use as a cane and as a seat for a short rest, when needed. I figured that it would be handy at events where everyone else would be standing or sitting on the grass. It probably is. But, the seat is about the height of an ordinary chair. That's ok if you can lift yourself up with just your legs. For the average person this would work well. Then why do they need a cane at all? For anyone who needs something stable for a little support in rising from sitting to standing this is not it. It wobbles enough even on a hard, level surface that it is not for anyone who has balance problems or needs help standing up. So, I am mulling the question of who would use this? Why carry a cane if not for a little extra help, if necessary, with balance? Why carry a cane with a seat if balance and leg strength are fine? The apparatus it self is heavier and less balanced than a cane alone so there must be people who would use it. I just can't figure out who."
3,Take a seat,"I really cannot rate this yet. I haven't used it, however thehandle may get in the way if a female uses it and has on a dress.It seems sturdy. I wish it had a strap to put over theshoulder."
5,So far so good.,"I need a cane at times. But more than that, I cannot stand for long without pain. We travel a lot. I saw someone using one of these and I thought, ""That's for me!"" Have cane/set will travel.Barbara Berman"
3,Helpful but not,"I so much liked ""Feel the fear and do it anyway"" by Susan Jeffers, I liked her warm and enthusiastic reading of her book too. That was the reason why I wanted to listen to ""Inner Talk for Peace of Mind"".What a disappointment when I put the CD on. Susan's voice is loud and clear, but the ""background music"" is loud and clear too! I have an excellent player, but I just couldn't make the ""background sound"" fade back where it should be, in the background. I think this is a technical fault. If it is remastered so the music doesn't overwhelm Susan's voice, then I'll buy it again. So far, I send my CD back. Sorry Susan!"
4,Love it but 1.5 min tracks suck,"I love Susan. Her voice, her ideas, her books and tapes. But having a cd that has broken up tracks that are 1 1/2 mins long that begin and end yet continue the same 'roll' of affirmations is HORRIBLE. This would have gotten 5 stars from me if they kept the same music in the background and made an elongated track to listen to for 20+ mins. The last 10 tracks is just comprised of short clips of music and waves or sea birds and whales. Glad I got this from the library and didn't pay for it. Whoever produced this cd ruined it by breaking it up into segments."
1,Innacurate...,"Not only useless because is far too simple written, but full of major mistakes too. In first 27 pages I spotted 2 major mistakes: One at page 8 were the listing is pretty much mangled in the upper part of the page. Also, as Unix Admins on real HA systems, we don't use the GUI but rather the command line which only got 5 pages in the book. The Disksuite documentation supplied by Sun and available at docs.sun.com is much better and not at all complicated. The volume manager part is outdated since the current version available use a completelly diferent GUI application. It was outdated even at the time the book was published. Hey, technical reviewers, why do you allow such books to appear ?"
1,Two Words,Blows Chunks...I was disappointed - this book seems very simple minded - yet lacking a lot of important and relevant information.;
1,Waste of money !,"This book is to basic to be called a ""Guide to high availability"". If you have any experience as SysAdmin you already know the contents. Also too many screen snapshots for a Unix book ..."
1,too thin on in depth knowledge,"I skimmed through this book in about an hour, I didn't gain much from this. Actually you can get all of the same info from the disksuite documentation and veritas vm online docs from their respective websites. At the least I would have hoped for a more indepth explination of data center best practices, etc.. I give this book a thumbs down.."
4,"Not a true sign wave UPS, but it's been 6 years and going strong.","Came here to Amazon to buy batteries for it and thought I'd post a quick review. We bought it because we were having trouble with our Samsung TV having problems. Our electrical supply was subject to a lot of surges, brown outs, etc. We bought this 6 years ago on advice from the Samsung tech people and it's been working perfectly ever since. (The TV and the UPS.) Batteries finally just died and we are buying replacements. I hope we can get another 6 years out of them. :)(Note: this is a not a true sine wave UPS. Which means some sensitive items will not work with it. However, for normal desktops and TV/AV equipment it works great.)"
1,Needs to be reviewed!,Text has many spelling errors and some wrong words that can really confuse you. Some parts Do NOT follow NREMT-I guidelines. Some diagrams are wrong or upside down. There are 2 versions of this text that differ greatly but you can only tell them apart by a white dot on the back cover.
5,Wonderful first Bible!!,"This was my first bible. I bought it when I went to my first Navigators meeting at the University of Cincinnati. It is a wonderful bible for people just starting their spiritual walk. It has a schedule for reading the Bible in a year. It has inserts on each page in which different authors give lessons on the scripture of that page. It also has several insert page sections that have different illustrations used by the Navigators.One section deals with how to conduct daily quiet times. One section deals with how to memorize scripture. One section deals with how to run a bible study. One section gives perspectives of the Bible. Another section gives the promises of God. Another section gives an explanation of how to prepare a personal testimony.This bible also has several maps in the back including one that shows the routes of Paul's mission trips. I would recommend this bible to anyone, but peticularly college age students."
5,The true origin of birds,"This is an excellent and beautiful book. Snow is an artist of high caliber. As an expert on birds, he also well understands the nonsense of the evolutionary explanation for the origin of birds. So he presents a high-quality overview, showing that birds - like all animals - could only be the product of divine creation."
5,swirlies always will be number 1 in my book,"most of the recordings are more like isnt anything period my bloody valentine. saw them for the 12th time last month. and although they have improved their live set you still find yourself waiting, yet its worth every minute. album is amazing, and this is their last for taang so now damon can really do what he wants."
5,"Exciting, and Faced Paced-A Great Thriller","I found this book to be just as thrilling and exciting as the movie. The way the author writes, in short little chapters, with cliffhangers at the end of each one, keeps the reader interested and on their feet until the very end. A great for anyone who likes thrillers."
4,"I got this as a gift, and I really liked it!","I disagree with the other reviewers, I think this book was very helpful and useful, even for rthe not so rich. For example, one of my favorite parts was illustrations of different wedding gown types such as diffent necklines and waist styles. It t even recommend the most flattering dress style for different figures. It gives information about popular wedding flowers and their season of availability. It gives suggestions for wording on invitations no matter who is hosting. It has a checklist of neccessary bridal regisrty items. Another one of my favorite parts is that it gives thank you gift ideas for your attendants, and the parents of the bride and groom. I thought this made a terrific gift and has proved to be very, very helpful."
1,Boring and unreasonable,"This book is for people who do not have a wedding budget and who can afford a $100,000.00 wedding. This book is so dry and boring talking about etiquete it puts you to sleep. It makes planning a wedding seem like planning a funeral. No fun at all."
3,Great show! Mediocre DVD,"I had seen this performance on TV some time ago and I wanted to own the DVD. The show was great (as I already knew), but I was somewhat disappointed that the disc came in a cardboard sleeve rather than a plastic case or jewel. Also, the DVD did not have closed captions."
4,Good movie but DVD case is disappointing,"The DVD comes in a thin piece of cardboard where the disc slides into it.I know because the cardboard is so thin, it will easily get lost on my shelf and this cardboard won't protect my DVD if someone accidentally steps on it. For 18 bucks, you'd think the distributor could have sold the DVD in a proper case.On a positive note, the content on the DVD is great. Julia Sweeney comes off much less arrogant than most proponents of atheism. This is good for people who are sitting on the fence and are still wrestling with their beliefs."
4,no,"Saw this on ""pay tv"". Thought it addressed a number of search issues I and my friends have experienced over the years. Presented in an inforrmative, yet primarily entertaining format. I enjoyed it."
4,Entertaining - enjoyable,"Sweeney's DVD was fun - to the point - enjoyable - her memories of childhood Catholic training was entertaining. Her search for God touched on several religions. Her quandry has been experienced by most ""seekers""."
3,letting go of god,"i didnt realize it was a one person comedy. i mistakenly thought, according to its title, that it'd be a discussion of reason over faith. it's probably my mistake for not reading the description more closely before i purchased it."
1,Incoherent ramblings of a sad person,"Cable tv is lately promoting hard all kinds of newborn religionists, ""former Catholics"", like Bill Maher, Julia Sweeney and few others. That's how I had the displeasure of getting to know Julia the religionist and her ""Letting Go of God"".Like sexism and racism, religionism - the public display of bigotry against religious beliefs - needs to be put by law in its proper place.Statistics tell that people find and lose their religious faith all the time. It's just weird, and sad, to come across those who so strongly believe that there is nothing more to human existence than pooping and dieting.In their eyes, their forced ""humor"" one can see profound sadness and a desperate anxiety to find reason to live.My review will be thumbed down heavily, I know. The reason is simple: no one sane comes near this sorry bunch and their religionist agenda."
5,Wonderfully moving.,"Started out a little slow at first but it was all necessary as the wonderful story built. It was extremely touching and heartfelt and of course, humorous!"
5,Free thought DVD,This is Great. I thought it was very funny. Did not change my beliefs. But it sure is food for thought.
4,Excellent and funny video,"She lays out the logical and scientific arguments of why most likely there isn't any god, and does so in an entertaining way."
4,a clever atheist,"Julia wittily, and without unpleasantness, reviews her lifetime path away from religion. She has obviously read and studied almost all the religions, and remains very objective as cuts most of the organized religions to pieces. Her story is not only intelligent, it is funny."
5,"Oh, Julia!","I have her book, her CD, and her DVD now. I feel like we were identical growing up, had the same exact experiences. We are now both atheists. So I love her work. She is hysterical. Not so terribly offensive to others of different beliefs, only expressing her right to her own opinion. Her work makes anyone think about their beliefs. Love it. Love it."
2,You get what you pay for,"The guns are junk, the triggers are always sticking, it is very difficult to fix, let alone the guns do not stay in the float they are always falling out. To get into to float is a very difficult task for an adult let alone a child. I would not recommend this product."
2,A USER'S Beginner's Book,"If you're a developer looking for some handy tips and tricks...well, keep looking. This is definitely a beginner's book, and may be useful for users brand new to BusinessObjects. Honestly, based on the price of this book I'd pass."
2,Mediocre Texbook on Business Objects,"This book is clearly for the beginner to intermediate user as I was able to find most examples and recommendations using examples, etc. in the help files. Most of the examples were obvious and lacked sufficient detail and a 'what if' analysis. However, the web site they provided for help was extremely useful. In fact, I recommend using the web site as the source for inforamtion in place of this book. I found answers to all of my questions on this web site."
5,BusinessObjects: Complete Report Writing Course,"I would highly recommend the purchase of this book for any level of BusinessObjects user. The content is outstanding, especially the chapter on formulas. The book allows you to work at your own pace to understand key concepts in BusinessObjects. The book gives realistic, easy-to-understand examples to explain key concepts. As I read and worked through the book, I gained valuable information that no one from my company took the time to explain to me. I am amazed at how many tips I am gaining from this book as I continually use it as a resource to better understand how BusinessObjects works. I am much more productive in BusinessObjects since I have read and worked through this book, and I am adding more value to our company with the knowledge that I have gained because of this outstanding resource. - Kristy Evans"
5,Wow,"I was a bit scared to listen at first because i loved the last record so much. The Hustler, though, is Jeff's finest work to date. I didnt think he could top himself, but he has. It almost sounds like a completely different artist but with Jeff's voice. The title track is haunting me everytime. And Pity is a refreshing new direction."
1,Too Many Zebra Questions !,I Found that this review book had a great section on how to understand the type of questions on the PANCE. The test questions however were not even closely related to that I found to be on the actual PANCE. The AAPA review guide is by far the best bang for your buck.
3,Daniel,"This book was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. There were a few ""zebra"" questions but for the most part the questions represented a decent review. The explanations aren't as good as Appleton and Lange but many important points come across. I wouldnt use this book as the only review but it provides a nice question bank that you can use for extra practice and confidence for the big day."
1,Had to return product.,I returned the product because it does not remain standing as air naturally leaks. Did not remain standing for even 24 hours. Do not recommend.
1,Won't stay up,"The inflatable shower is still not standing up on its own after 2 days of trying to balance it. If you don't tie it to something, it's not going to work. Waste of money!"
2,Cheap-looking pink...,"The stones are extremely cheap-looking pink rather than ruby red as pictured on this page. I would be embarrassed to give this to my wife as a gift. I do not agree with other reviewers. Perhaps they received a different pendant or are teenage girls who would be satisfied with a casual, just cute-looking pendant. Will return the item."
2,Disappointing,"This book focused mainly on how storms and tornadoes form, and very little information on the tornados effect on the great plains and the people who live there. Alot of the language is very technical and hard to understand (unless you are a scientist or expert). There are some interesting stories but not enough to make buying this book worthwile. This book is recommended for experts, and not lay people. I was interested in specific tornadoes and the effects on people and this book didn't deliver it."
4,sophia,"2 films with Sophia, what else can you ask for! ""Two Women"" a great film....probably one of her best. ""Angela"" is good....a typical film from the 1970's to say the least but still good. Have bought from this retailer before and have not had a problem.... Packing was great. Service great."
4,A new boy on the street,Kid Parmlee a youngster of 13 kills the creep who killed his dog Farty. So his father gives him 10.00$ and an old swayback horse and tells him to leave Texas. Kid ends up in Fosterville and is happy until his past arrives. He is asked to join the bounty hunt for 3 guys who had just robbed the local bank. The Kid saw the men as they were leaving the bank with the loot. Well after the sheriff gives up the chace 'cause he's outta h's territory the Kid continues on. What trouble a guy cud get in young Kid found. The poor English made it difficult but I caught on.
5,Slow But The Best!,"It's one of the COOLest song by Gwen. It's slow, but it's good. If you ever seen the video clip, it's good! This single is good, but I'd rather choose Rich Girl than this. The lyrics, it's like a poem (maybe). For the lyrics, I give her 8.5. It's much more better than the Hollaback Girl lyrics, I must say. For the tone, she got 9. It's slow and good. Many other slow songs has a boring tone. But this one is different! For the video clip, I'd give 8. She looked classy and... beautiful. Even the cover is good!With this song, Gwen proofs that she can sing different kinds of music. In Pop, her Rich Girl is really gooood. In Rock (with little combination with pop) , her What You Waiting For rocks! In hiphop, her Hollaback Girl is really really popular (wow, it got a triple platinum!). In slow(80s-90s) music, Cool is the best. Luxurious is also slow and good.So, overall, this single got 9.5 for me!Highly recommended! Buy it! :)"
2,Hear me out,"The song ""Cool"" is a great song. The remixes on this cd are okay to me. I love remixes, but these were not that great. I mainly bought the CD for the video, which I love, and the video doesnt exist on the cd I bought. Be mindful about that possibility if you want to buy this cd. The song and video for ""Cool"" are superb!"
4,great music with just one small problem,"Love all the tracks on here , my only complaint is that the last track with the video can only be viewed on dvd-rom! Why would you not want to watch that video on a hi end flat screen ??????"
2,"Inspiring story, Poorly written","1. This is an inspiring story, unfortunately marred by the poor writing. The author's apparent narcissism doesn't help either.2. If you want to read an incredible / inspiring / sobering military book--> check out Lone Survivor; much better."
2,Should have been 4.5 stars,"I was eager to read Capt. Rozelle's book and compare with others by combat veterans from previous conflicts as far back as the American Revolution. Though the Captain has been exemplary in his actions as a soldier, and in his determination to overcome his disability, I was dissapointed and offended by the use of profane and vulgar language in the text. I realize the useage is common in the military, (I am a veteran myself), but it is never appropriate in an historical text to be read now and for generations to come.I am also dissapointed in Regnery for not providing better editing."
4,Seasoned Poet on Death Row,"Reginald Lewis brings to this collection of poems his experience of prison, death row, old flames, injustice, his passion for social issues, and his love of jazz. He is a wordmaster who has found his own unique voice, and the emotional courage to speak his own truth."
4,A rare talent,"His work, moving and soul searching, reeks with a rare talent.. To miss reading this very moving and inspiring book would be an injustice to the author."
2,Quantrill Riders,"This book seems to be well written. It does have limitation that the title leads you to believe. It does not list all people who rode with Quantrill. This book deals only with the most famous of the riders and the riders that were the closest to him. I feel there were more people that rode with him and that there should have been an appendix that showed other riders that rode with him, even if only on a limited basis and that was not included in this book. I believe he should have included the book that he co wrote called ""Branded as Rebels"" to increase the authintisity of the title."
1,This is the Devil's music,"David Gray is proof positive that there is an omnipotent evil entity in the universe and it has a really bad taste in music. When the day of judgement finally arrives it won't be all fire and brimstone and the four horsemen, it'll be the Corrs, Robbie Williams, Geri Halliwell and this bloke. This is a painful experience for me because I have to think back to being subjected to listening to this album in a friend's car for an interminabley long journey - or at least it seemed that way - of at least five miles. Babylon and Please Forgive Me (if my songs are a little dull) are big hit singles, but god they're boring. And This Year's Love has got to be the most maudlin piece of self pity since R Williams' Better Man. Don't take my word for it, watch David Gray perform on TV and observe his head bobble around in an unnaturally sinister way. See, he is possessed."
2,Not thrilling,"The subject did not hold my daughter's interest and she quickly tired of this book, unfortunately. A little too much on the relationships in the book and not as much mystery as she had hoped."
3,Multiple Spirits NOT Multiple Personalities,"My interest in the book was triggered by the CBS 60 Minutes program on this book and Oxnam in October 2005. The information gathered was very fascinating but it did not cover the subject deeply enough.One of the personality `Baby' talks about childhood abuse in the book that may be the cause of Oxnam's symptoms. Also his psychiatrist denies `implanting memories' (personalities).But the Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) or Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), although is given a psychiatric diagnosis, but its true cause is still enigmatic. I have a totally different take on this topic as far as the cause is concerned. My hypothesis is that these ""personalities"" are actually different, multiple spirits that happen to attach to the sufferer. That would explain the hallucinations, and conflicting behaviors exhibited by the person.Mohinder Goomar, M.D., F.R.C.S.(Ret.), author, Secrets of Life, Beyond..."
3,There are better books out there,"This book is well written but long winded. There is a lot of history about the author's past that, in my opinion, could have been edited to be shorter. The portrayal of the alters was insightful and interesting; even so, I became bored half way through and quit reading. I might suggest this book as something to be skimmed but not read. I have read First Person Plural which I found much more interesting, perhaps it's because there was not so much background information and it dealt with the issue at hand; the emergence of alters and the subsequent problems. I found the writing to be more personal and therefore it kept my interest."
3,It's alright...,"Although this is an interesting book, i did find it challenging to keep up with the different personalities, so be patient when reading this book.I'd recommend it."
2,Just okay,"This book was just way too dull for me. I finished it because I thought it may get better but it really didn't. The book was an easy and quick read and the personalities were easy to keep up with, but it really isn't worth your time!If you are interested in MPD or mental illness and like memoirs, read First Person Plural: My Life as a Multiple - which is a wonderful book!"
2,dry,This book fell to the floor where it was pounced upon and chewed by my nieces 3 pound dog who `forthwith' lost 10 pounds of the nectar of life. We shall be suing Dover for her wrongful death by dehydration. Boolean Algebra is a fine subject but this book ... the most turgid bit of writing since `OG the trog-dude' first scratched a mark on a cave wall.
2,Slow and stilted,"I kept hoping this book would get better. The story line was slow and repetative. I still don't know what happened to the main character as a youth. You just get to guess it was something bad and had to do with her father. Dialogue was hard to follow, stilted and choppy. I simply cannot recommend this book at all."
1,worst book ever,the story is absolutely horrible. two sappy overdramatic women having pointless conversations. only reason i read it was because it was free. really heavy on the christian influences which i dont mind but it was way over the top and dramatic.
1,Free Kindle Download,"I was interested in this book through the first few chapters; then I became bored and annoyed with repeated phrases and ridiculously unrealistic scenarios. I only completed the book, so that I could give it a full and honest review.Chris McIntyre is an emotionally troubled Desert Storm veteran who is constantly attacked by men. When she's not being attacked by men, her friend Erin is praying and trying to force her into Christianity. The End"
2,"Heavy handed, heavy going.","I downloaded the Kindle version when it was offered for free. First of all, I do wish that the Kindle listing clearly stated that this was a book with a heavy Christian slant. I might not have downloaded it if I had known. Not that I have something against all novels with a religious element - some of my favorite books have that - but I have usually found contemporary Christian novels to be extremely heavy handed with the Christian parts. This book is no exception.Beyond that, the writing is okay which is why I give it two stars. However, the characters are for the most part uninteresting, morose, or just plain boring. The one character I even vaguely liked gets killed very early on. I don't require all the characters in a book to be likeable, but at the very least they should be interesting.In any case, I will be reading the descriptions of non-classic free Kindle books a lot more carefully from now on."
2,"Nancy in Seattle, WA: Dont't bother.",I can't believe I bothered to finish this book. Can't be returned cause it was a free download. So many of the scenes and the dialogue seemed stilted and forced. There really didn't seem to be a natural flow to the storyline. I liked the general idea of the book better than the execution.
1,Cheap,"I did not keep this item very long before sending it back. The blue thing holding the flutes together was just a toe separater...VERY flimsy. The flutes would have just fallen out had I allowed my child to play with them. The drum is small but I didn't really have complaints about that. My main complaint was that the product showed up USED when it was supposed to be new! There were HAIRS in the tape holding the pieces inside the box and there were parts of the xylophone that were missing. Yours may not come in this condition, but this was completely unacceptable!"
4,My 3 yr old daughter loves this musical set.,"There are so many bath toys out-there, this is one provides quality fun without the characters normally plastered all over other toys. We have had the item for six months and my daughter still loves the kit -- be forewarned there are a lot of pieces, which if you step-on early in the morning when your taking a shower you will know it -- I recommend a mesh bag for storage."
3,It's OK,"The xylophone is a waste b/c the pieces interlock and come apart. It has to be put together every time my kids want to play with it. Otherwise, the pieces are floating all over the tub, if we even put them in the tub anymore. If it was one solid piece I think they'd love it. My kids like the flutes and the drum but they have more fun with measuring cups and other toys than they do with this set. There is also a possibility that a child could drink the water that fills the flutes, depending on the age."
4,Something different for the tub.,"The xylophone sounds nice, but not sure why the keys come apart, just something else to loose. Sound is pretty, but the keys are small and a little hard to hit accurately for little ones. The drum is has a rather dead tone, but still fun to bang on in the tub. I like that you can change the pitch by tipping it and letting some water in underneath. The flutes do not retain the amount of water you put in due to the required air vent need to play them if you let them fall int he water, but they sound nice. Several songs included. All-in-all a fun toy set for the tub."
5,Better than expected,"Delivered on time, and in much better condition than I was expecting. ""Good"" looked ""Like New"". Fantastic omnibus, a great read & good value. Thoroughly enjoyable historical fiction, fun for all ages. Third omnibus in the Hornblower series."
1,Book not received.,"I haven't the slightest idea whether this book is good or bad. I was supposed to receive it by 12/20 and it still hasn't arrived. I notified the seller, bksonsgr, and the response wasn't very satisfactory."
2,Dangerous sharp corners,"Be careful . . while this storge unit is sturdy and attractive, the corners are extremely pointy and hard AND at eye level for toddlers. I have the cabinet with the 6 openings. I was very disapointed to have to put rubber safety corners all around. Even the 4 corners on the bottom of the unit are sharp. I have never seen kids furniture with sharp pointy corners. I wrote an email to the company but haven't received a responses. Pass on this one if you have kids in the house!"
4,Thanks,Thanks for your understanding that old things need preserving. Movies by bygone actors are fun to see again. This actor died too soon.
