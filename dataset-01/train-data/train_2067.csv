3,Different but still good!,"Don't expect to find the same quick fix of hardcore on this cd that you will on the other Orange 9MM releases, but you will find a more creative approach with a lot more programming. After listening to this album a couple of times I've really come to enjoy it and look forward to moving with the band towards a more interesting future. If you like the band, buy the album, you will be surprised, but not disappointed!"
1,Total misconception,"Recording quality: goodRepertoire: fairPerformance: badThis was a sad atempt to introduce Mr. Sandoval to the roll of classical trumpet players. He is indeed a master technician of the instrument but has no understanding of interpretation in Baroque and Classical periods.All the concertos (except his own) are totaly out of the right dinamics, tonguing, articulations, slurs, and vibrato. This last item (the vibrato) plays an important role in ones interpretation. Mr. Sandoval uses it as he was playing popular Cuban music. His articulation and tonguing are extremely heavy, giving the pieces a too much marcial style rather than a delicate solo part. There are too many bad things in this recording, but I won't list all of them.This album should go togheter with his Trumpet Method, which is another unsucessful atempt.I would not recommend this recording to anyone seriously interested in trumpet playing. This CD is surely for fans only."
2,not a real study guide,"I had completely misunderstood how this book was written and laid out. I had thought that it would be a companion to Henry's, with more explanations, case studies, outlines and exam questions. But in fact it has none (or exceedingly little) of those things. 434 of its 467 pages are blank questions with the page numbers from Henry written in so you can look up the answer and write it into the space provided. In my coursework, I've already written and organized hundreds of index cards, outlining the chapters of Henry. This book adds nothing extra to my understanding.The three appendices at the end are interesting...path questions based on slides, smears, parasites. Math review questions and one comprehensive practice exam. But that's far too small a section for me to spend $52 on.This book is good for anyone who wants to pay an outrageous sum for what amounts to a very fancy and flashy notebook."
3,Its was good,"I accidently saw this movie on tv in the early morning while being very bored. So I started watching it and couldnt get myself to change the channel. This was a indepentdeant low budget movie , of mostly dialog. But i held my attention. This suspense movie had me watching to see what would happen next. THe main plot of the movie is a young lady moves into a apartment and her neighbor just keep making to much noise with her sex and music and what not. This noise just keep build up and up and ruins the young ladys life. The ending is very surprising. It wouldnt hurt to watch this movie."
5,I loved the revenge,"I just want to say that I loved it so much when Joyce slit Charlotte's throat in the middle of Charlotte's abusive rant. That could possibly be my favorite movie moment ever. I watched that clip over and over. And then Joyce got away with the murder. What a happy ending. I had contempt for Joyce until she got her revenge. This sort of thing happens all the time in real life, where a bully tries to ruin your life and it gets to the point where you don't have much choice but to fight back very hard. I really hate people that try to ruin other people's lives, and I'm so glad that Charlotte got what she deserved. This movie portrays a very realistic life situation and has a very happy ending. I loved it."
1,Sets watermark for a bad movie! MINUS 1 star!,"This movie is unbelievably bad. From the poor acting, to the ridiculous actions the characters take, to the laugably stupid, hanging ending, to the ultra cheeze whiz dialogue ( who WROTE this abomination of a screen play?! YUK!)...The idea was a decent enough one, what happens when you have a nutjob living above you in an apt, but the absolutely ridiculous way this movie unfolds had me laughing at how stupid the thing was. I watched in fascination, just because the whole thing was so bad, it was sort of like watching a trainwreck or a scary movie, you can't look away! LOL ....Contender for worst movie of the last decade."
4,didn't us it but,"This looks damn good but a bit heavy and using quite some space.I'm about to move from europe to the caribbean and I looking for a good 110v pizza oven.does this one have a top stone element also ?I think I might just go for the new Ferrari oven, anyone knows where to get it in the Us?It's selling very well on the euro market.http://www.g3ferrari.com/risultati.asp?famiglia=24&categoria;=13"
2,Not hot enough and stone not thick enough...,I wanted to like the oven BUT to be a pizza oven you need good heat and a good stone.I make my own pizza dough and use my normal oven with a 1/2 inch thick stone. I wanted this oven because I could put it outside and not heat up the house pre heating the oven...this oven heats to 450 and I was hoping the small size would be sufficient... but the top will be almost burnt before the dough is proper... also it took the pizza about 20 minutes to cook while my normal oven did it in about 10 ... this longer cooking time can yield a harder crust than desired ....Maybe for normal frozen pizza this oven is okay but if you make your own dough and pizza you will not get the heat you need ..... bummer
2,Liked my old one better,"My old pizza oven recently died and I needed a replacement. The door on this Cuisinart is attached and swings down, then you have to slide out the grate with a spatula or anything else you can find to avoid burning your hands.I much prefer the door / grate combination, where you can just grasp the handle, pull out the door, and slide the pizza onto a waiting pan.It's a little smaller and lighter than my old one, but I'm finding I'm using my oven instead - larger space, less likely to burn myself.Also, the instructions to preheat 30 minutes before using - not going to happen ever.For a gourmet / fresh pizza cook it's probably a good fit. For a frozen pizza lover, keep looking."
1,Do not buy this,"How do you remove the pizza from the oven, use a fork and drag it to a plate on the outside. Very poor design."
5,Great Bathouse From a Great Vendor,The bat house itself is very simple. What made my experience stand out was the vendor: NaturesRoom . They include a greatly informative pamphlet that helped in the placement of the bat house - and in the enjoyment of having the bats around.
3,Very predictable,"It took me about 3 hours to read this book after having read Kalakota and Robinson's 'ebusiness', which took me about one week. That's the difference. This isn't really a serious ebusiness book despite the endorsements given on the flap by the great and good of Interet business. It reads as if the writing of the book was scheduled for a couple of days, predictably covers all the usual stories (Schwab, Amazon, Cisco, Dell) and relies too much on a handful of interviews with executives from these companies. Very much an introductory 'storybook' with some nice one-liners but no real meat. Particularly disappointing that we don't get much perspective from Mr Siebel himself who has written better elsewhere. If you want real ebusiness insight, go to Varian and Kalakota."
2,Not bad,"Although I found this book to have some interesting points, I also found it to be a big promotion for Siebel's business. At some points I almost felt like I was reading a thick Siebel pamphlet. I was disappointed to find that the content I thought was most important was buried in the back of the book. If you have never read a book on e-business/e-commerce, this book is worth a try. If you are comfortable with the subject and are seeking more advanced content, skip this book."
1,Don't bother,"This book was really weak. I recommend Net Ready over this. There are some GLARING inconsistencies in this book. They include, but are not limited to: Yahoo is listed as a search engine... not as a directory. The location of MAE East is erroneously stated as being in NYC. This is just a sample... The book was a waste of time and money. Heed my warnings! Here be dragons!"
4,"beautifull watch, delicate cristal","I recieved this watch for my birthday, It's really beautifull and every dresser watch. Take care if you are a person with a thin arms, because this watch is (for me) huge, because the first section is not movil. Other problem was that the next day I saw a thiny line on the screen, it's very delicate to use."
5,The Glasses OTTER DO THIS AGAIN SOON!,"Having seen these guys as many times as I have, I know that they throw down like no other. Just when I thought technical metalcore was dead, The Glasses Otter have brought the revival by themselves. Yes, people will compare them to the Dillinger Escape plan, but they're wrong. The Glasses Otter are bringing the newest of the new school with their joyous shredding of love, hate, and beer."
5,Great Books for All Thinkers,Joey Allen has done a great service for parents. These books present basic Christian teachings in a format that is educationally appropriate and child focused. My oldest son (5) and daughter (3) have both enjoyed these books. As a parent I have learned to better communicate my faith for little thinkers.
4,Thought provoking and a real call to action!,"I enjoyed the book, both for the insight it provided and the way that questions were asked. This style forced me to think about the issues and reflect on their meaning to my business life.This is a great book to take on your next airline flight....it will make the time go by quickly."
2,"""The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Vol. 1""","I've use to have ""I Love to Singa"", ""Have you got any Castles"", and ""Katnip Kollege"" on Looney Tunes Vol. 2. Also, I've watched ""The Wild Hare"", Bugs Bunny's first offical cartoon, first appearances like ""Odor-able Kitty"" (Pepe LePew), ""A Tale of Two Kitties"" (Tweety), ""I Haven't Got a Hat"" (Porky Pig), ""Life with Feathers"" (Sylvester) and ""Walky Talky Hawky"" (Foghorn Leghorn)."
3,Just Okay,I have been using SG Fabric Softener for about 3 months now. I have to add a little more to reduce the static on some fabrics like Nylon and Lycra. The lavender fragrance is not present when the clothes leave the dryer.
2,Left marks on clothes,I used this and the detergent together and there were oil marks or something on my clothes. It happened a few times when I used this product. Otherwise it worked well.
3,It's works okay...,While it definately makes a difference in softness and static... none of the wonderful scent is left after drying. I was hoping to have some of the light lavender scent that is present after washing to remain once my clothes were dry but unfortunately nothing remains. So I probably will search for an alternative softener or go without.
1,I would Pass on this One,"We bought this product recently. I was unimpressed with the cleaning. After looking further I saw that Seventh Generation had been caught for not disclosing all of the ingredients in their products. Consumer reports had an article on this.Ironically, the company and its President, Mr. Hollander, brag about how their product discloses all of its ingredients, yet they don't even know the ingredients.This is because Seventh Generation doesn't manufacture anything themselves. They outsource it, to who knows maybe a company in China. The bottom line is they don't know what is in it since they don't make it. They are simply a marketing company. Don't buy into the hype and be ripped off.You can buy Tide Free & Clear or Method Products for a lot less. Unlike Seventh Generation, they make their own products and know what is in it."
5,Great product,"As others have said, the eucalyptus smell does not perceptibly stay in the clothes - whether you use a dryer or hang clothes out to try (I've tried it both ways). However it does a great job and I no longer have to user dryer sheets when drying the clothes. Highly recommend it."
3,Not what I expected,"After reading the reviews, I gave this a try. I didn't get the good results. Wish I could say that I did. I didn't smell the nice smell -- didn't smell anything and there was no smell in the items after they were washed and dried. They were softer, but I was anticipating a nice lingering scent."
1,DOES HEAT AFFTECT THE PERFORMANCE?,"Besides filling my softner compartment in my front load washer to the max with this product it barely leaves a streak of softness after drying in my dryer. (Mind that i almost always use medium heat). Except for yesterday i happen to dry my clothes on a low heat heat setting and VIOLA! What do you know? My clothes came out as if i had put softener. Well, i didnt find that out until now, now that the bottle is almost empty.Well, i'll try the heat setting thing again, and if it works then i'm happy and the solution to my problem is solved.But if my theory is true that medium to high heat affects the performance of this product, if not totally eliminates the purpose, this is not a good thing, and an issue the Seventh Gneration needs to address."
1,Makes no scents,"I buy fabric softener for the scent, since modern detergent usually softens the clothes as well, and this leaves none in the clothes. I feel like it's a waste of money, since my goal for detergent is cleanliness and my goal for fabric softener is a nice scent. They should advertise it as ""unscented."" Can't even tell I washed clothes."
4,"Nice softening power, but a little low on scent","I decided to try this fabric softener in the hopes of doing something good for the environment while keeping my laundry static free and with a nice scent. While the fabric softerner accomplishes the first goal of eliminating static, it has a much weaker scent than traditional, chemically-based brands. When used in conjunction with the ""Blue Eucalyptus and Lavender"" detergent by the same brand, the scent is a bit more pronounced. However, don't purchase this product with the expectation of a strong scent that a perfume would provide, because it's not going to happen. I am satisfied with the product as a whole, because it softens my clothes and does not use harsh solvents or other chemicals. At that time of my purchase, the price at Amazon was also significantly lower than at Whole Foods and similar stores that sell this brand."
3,Soft but static,"Thought I would try this product when it went on sale as environmentally friendly is a goal for me.It works well as a softener, but I have more static in my clothes than with commercial softeners.I have an issue with the product packaging. It would be helpful if the company differentiated more between the detergent and softener. I have to stop and take a close look every time to make sure I am picking up the right product and even used the softener instead of detergent once. Yes, one is white and the other translucent, so they aren't the 'same'. But how hard would it be to enlarge the print stating 'softener' or 'detergent'. This may not be a problem to young eyes, but for me it is close to a deal breaker.One other note. If you are allergic to any soy products, do not use this. Itching guaranteed."
5,The Best,"I love the O'Jays and this album was very, very good! They truly are Triumphant. (the triumphs)."
3,Ask for a free sales brochure...,"This book showcases many examples of how GIS can be applied in the field of transportation using ArcView GIS, but it doesn't come with any theory. As such, it is more like an overpriced sales brochure and not a textbook. Nevertheless, the examples are really neat and should inspire any practitioner in the field."
4,This book rocked!,"A book where gargoyle's, not were's or vamps or aliens, are the dark hero's in turmoil? Interesting!Rachel and Nathan, our main couple, meet during a art gallery showing and are instantly attracted. Each has their own troubles though. Rachel is there as part of an interpol mission to take down an assasin.Policework has been her lifes work since as a small child she saw her family killed by what she thought were monsters...Nathan is an excomunicated gargoyle who has lived 14 lifetimes in different ages before he was reborn into this one. Now he has decided to end his existance for good since he has been shunned by the others of his dwindeling kind.They meet again after Nathan stumbles into Rachel's hit man and does the work for her. But she has a feeling he's not all he appears...and Nathan's freinds will need both of them to come help the gargoyles if they are to survive. Together they uncover a secret about that long ago attack on Rachel's family..."
4,definitely different,"I don't think I have ever read a book on gargoles. Nice having a new take on the paranormal romance. I really liked the beginning of the book. Taylor begins with the six year old herione of the story getting her daddy to look under the bed, in the closet, etc. for the ""monsters."" She really just wants all his attention for herself since there is a new edition to the family. The chapter ends when the same six year old watches her parents murdered as she and her baby brother hide in the cupboard beneath the stairs. A very dramatic beginning to the story. Definitely grabs the reader. I simple felt I could not put the book down until I discovered the reason behind her parents murder. It also set the premise of why the herione was so driven to find the ""monsters"" she witnessed killing her parents.Excellent book, I gave it four stars instead of five because I thought the story lagged around the middle."
5,UNBELIEVEABLY WONDERFUL!!! 5+++,This is an outstanding book! I really cannot say enough about it. I cannot wait for Flesh and Stone next April (what an awfully long year)! I do not want to ruin anything so all I will say is READ it and ENJOY! Nathan and Rachel absolutely sizzle and it is great fun to watch them fight the attraction and lose :) This on is a real winner!
4,Interesting world of Gargoyles,"This book has an interesting plot with the Gargoyles and their struggle for survival in the modern world. The romance and passion between Rachel and Nathan is good but the plot about the Gargoyles is very original and interesting. I especially empathized with Nathan Cross's struggle with his near-immortality and the personal choice he made before meeting Rachel. The Gargoyles are very believable and the readers do not need to suspend their disbelief to read this book. It is a rather dark story though so no breezy romance here. For those who enjoy romance and some paranormal, this is a good read."
5,Required reading.,"This book (or perhaps a condensed version) should be required reading for all high school students or college freshmen. The breadth and depth of his arguments, and the great diversity of his examples are all breathtaking. I find myself constantly talking about this book and especially the examples to friends and family.Buy this book. Read it. Give it as a gift to friends. It will help clarify your thinking on any number of issues."
4,Impressed by honest conservatism,"In this day of spurious conservatives seeking political power by any means, Sowell's conservatism deserves attention. If you are ready to be challenged, read it!"
1,kindle version of the eBook,I am so much looking forward to reading Dr. Sowell's <<Knowledge and Decisions>>. I purchased eBook from Kindle store and it never downloaded to my PC.I have tried all the methods provided from the Web page. They seem not helpful.I would give the Kindle store 'negative' marks based on my experience.I have read parts of Dr. Sowell's book and I would give his work 5+ stars.
2,Not much about economics,"I can't fault a book for having an opinion. I can fault it for disguising an opinion as research. The main premise of the book, that knowledge has a cost, is sound. Most of the pages, however, consist of Sowell's opinions on political issues. The connection of his arguments to the theme is frequently tenuous.The book is a long, wide-ranging compilation of arguments for conservative positions. The economic implications of knowledge costs is not dealt with thoroughly or rigorously, so Sowell has only done partly what he set out to do.The discussion on the ending of jitney-driving due to taxicab regulations brought an unfamiliar subject to my attention. This surprising position is refreshingly honest, because it is consistent with his economic ideas."
3,"""you must take care of your toys, Sid....""","this is a cute story of a homemade, and beloved stuffed rabbit who finds he's slightly abandoned and pushed to the side as his child, Ellen, gets older, and gets new store bought toys for her birthday.while this book is very good-many modern children will relate this story to the more current abandoned toys in the Toy Story movies( fuzzy rabbit was actually written WAY before Toy Story was). So some children may not be as enamoured with this story as children were in the 80's.It's still a quality tale of appreciating what you have, and the newer doesn't mean better concept-a good thing to talk to modern day mini mass consumers about:)3 stars!"
5,Fuzzy Rabbit-I love it!,"I love this book so much, I am planning to try to recreate Fuzzy for myself as a stuffed toy! I am trying to find all the materials I need to make this great character come to life for me. I truely feel that of all the childrens' books I have (and I have many), this one is truely the cutest and happiest. I can't wait to have children of my own to read it to! But, until I do, I'll just have to keep reading it myself!"
5,Quite possibly the greatest lectures ever on the human dynamic.,"Drew Weston is not only smart, but he's also a great teacher. Extremely intelligent stuff that's always interesting explained in laymens terms. Just my style. This is pyschology 10101. He includes alot of stuff you won't hear in the classroom."
4,Good beginner's book!,A great introduction to the life and works of Sergei Rachmaninoff. This book is geared towards younger readers (teenagers) but adults will find the text and photographs to their liking as well.
3,Celebrating Powerful Women,"This book was highly recommended to me a while back, and I quickly added it to my wish list as it looked exactly like the kind of book I love to read. Honestly, I'd say this book was a disappointment. All the men were losers, manipulative or abusive or cruel. The women seemed to wander from man to man, from loser to loser. And that was the plot of the book. The two main characters in the book write letters to each other, bemoaning the men in their lives and celebrating their strength as powerful women. I didn't see any powerful women in this book. Instead, I saw women who defined themselves over and over in terms of whether or not they had a man. In the book's defense, the copyright date is 1986, so perhaps the characters in that time frame in that culture were revolutionary. I wouldn't recommend this book, not even to women friends who are part of this culture."
3,"Works, but not great.","I bought this item 2 years ago and it recently died. Not really a problem because it has been used quite a bit and switched between two vehicles. I was never overly impressed with either the sound quality or the plugging in of the unit. I always had to jamb the unit into the power outlet harder than I wanted to get it to make contact and power on. I'm surprised it lasted for two years based solely on this fact. Once I got it to work the sound quality was never great. I didn't expect it to be but I didn't realize how bad it was until I got it's replacement, a Griffin Technology 4030-ROAD RoadTrip. The Griffin's worst sound(when you are on the same station as a radio station)is still better than this Maxell's best. (when you are on a station that is not being used)"
4,I Love Mine!,For the price this is a great product; no wires the ipod plugs right into it so there's no chasing your mp3 player around your car. I live in a fairly remote area so there's no competition for radio stations and I get great reception. It would be great if the song title would show up on the radio but hey for $40.00 whaddayawant? I would definitely buy it again.
1,Avoid at All costs,"This product is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!! I gave it one star only cause u had to give it something.There are much better products out there. You may spend 20 more dollars or so, but its worth it.This thing is a certified piece of trash."
4,Very good blade for heavy trimming,"This particular blade is very good for trimming trees with a reciprocal saw.Because of the size of this blade, working with this equipment is not a casual job, and prepare yourself for some hard work.Also, be wise and wear safety equipment."
5,Exceptional reading for young girls!,"I purchased this set for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas. She had never heard of Trixie Belden before, and so I was curious to see if she would like them. As soon as she started reading the first book, she was begging me to see if I could find the rest of the series before she got to #3! I am very pleased with the content in these books - nothing inappropriate! (Sometimes this is a rare find) I would recommend this book to anyone who has a girl that loves to read...they'll be hooked in no time, and there are a lot of books in the series to keep them going!"
5,Does as expected,I put these on my 1995 Chevy when I bought a new trailer. They keep truck level with trailer attached and with easy to inflate valves they are simple and easy to use.
4,Need help resolving this issue,"Installation whent smooth, had everything I needed to complete the installation. However the next morning the passanger side was back down. I removed the tire and releaked checked and finally found a leak on the top of the air bag.At this time I need to know who is standing behind this product so I can get it replaced. Any help with this would be helpfull.Thanks,Brian"
2,Not recommended for heavy bags,"I have an unusually heavy laptop bag for work (two 15 inch laptops, one main, one backup), and the hinge on this strap couldn't handle it. First, the action got all wonky and wouldn't stay closed, so I had to tape it shut. A few months later, it snapped completely.That said, the cushioning is very comfortable, and I was disappointed to lose it. I would recommend it for lighter loads though."
3,Should be better support,"One of my laptop case strap is broken. It looks the same as what I have right now, but it is not. It should have better quality support."
2,I hope M's next one is better,"I agree with much of what has been said by the other reviewers. I am, however, in a more relaxed place because I spent $1 for this movie at a video store going out of business. So, I am not angered by the outlay of cash, as others were. The movie was OK and made sense only after I watched the interview of the director in the Special Features. I believe there is some substance to this tale, and not an altogether waste. I was struck by how sexless the movie is. The actresses are neither sensual nor interested in sex. Why would a group of women, alone, not talk about sex or men(or women)? Lee Lee Sobieski's talents were wasted in this movie. I could see Jena Malone trying to make things happen. I will probably watch it again to see if I agree with my own remarks. If Lying is accepted by Criterion Collection, I will seriously doubt my own judgment."
1,boring,"The talented cast is what caught my attention. Unfortunately the film didn't do anything for me. It's too darn boring. I don't mind student or art films, but this film had nothing to keep me interested in watching it a second time."
2,"Tea: I think one sip is quite enough, bunny.","Overall, an incredibly boring and uninspiring film.The story follows a group of young attractive women who spend a weekend together in the country, to relax and unwind, possibly bond (on some level I couldn't figure out as I watched).You have a beautiful setting, and great talent in the movie. So what went wrong?Well, I'm glad you asked. Weak story and and poor characters would be my answer. Frankly, a waste of money and good talent.If you're going to bring a bunch of characters together, then there needs to be a point, for growth for revelations for something to happen that drives the drama and action of the story forward. You could have even made Chloe's character a serial killer, and turned the movie in a totally new direction. And no, it's not that aliens needed to make an appearance, just that there was no drama. Something needed to happen and nothing did.A sad unfortunate let down.I would not, repeat not, buy this for my collection."
1,"BORING, MEANINGLESS, ARTLESS AND PRETENTIOUS","Not sure if this is a hoax perpetrated on the unsuspecting viewer? If so, just who is laughing? If you take a video camera and just shoot your friends or even strangers in their random conversations and do no editing whatsoever my guess is that your finished film (you must stop at 94 minutes) will be better than ""LYING.""This film would make a great double feature with ""GERRY."" The one about the two guys named Gerry who get lost in the desert. And then one Gerry kills the other Gerry. Ooops, hope I didn't spoil it for anyone.This is a double loss. The time wasted watching this is lost forever and you probably can't return it to get your money back. Life can be so unfair but why waste it on really, really, really, really, really bad movies?"
3,The Joy in Loving,An inspirational book written by a selfless woman - makes one aware of what is really important.
2,"the content is amazing, the book not so much","I love this daily devotional book by Mother Teresa, but when I got the book in the mail, I opened it up and the pages were coming off the binding. I started to lose pages and the brand new book was falling apart. It was very disappointing to see that, but the content is amazing. How could you go wrong with Mother Teresa?"
4,It DOES NOT replicate store bought version.,"I have worked with 10 packets of the stuff over 3 months, different blenders, differnt types ice and I Cannot get it to the consistency/flavor of what I had in the store. It's tasty and is the best I can do, as I MISS the real thing. One tip: If you put the amount of ice it says on package it is way too watered down. Next time in Vegas or NY I will go get dessert MANY times as the home package just doesn't do it."
2,Not impressed!,Saw these on Oprah and ordered them for Christmas gifts. The packages are really ugly and cheap looking which didn't help when giving as gifts. Saved 2 packages for our family Christmas Eve treats. I can't say they are horrible but it tasted like any old chocolate shake. It has a very strong chocolate taste so I added more milk to tame the taste. These are pretty exprensive so we expected better.
3,Glad I only bought a 3-pack,"I was definitely expecting something fabulous by the way Oprah and her guests spoke about this product.It was tasty, but by no means the dessert to end all desserts. My husband, who is the real chocolate lover in our family, just shrugged and said it was okay.Oh well, it was worth a try. I'm just glad I didn't buy a 5-pack of the product."
2,Not worth the $$,"I bought the packs after a trip to NYC -- and due to the long wait -- could not get into the restaurant. It was pretty bad. The chocolate had a weird after-taste. I would have been better off making a chocolate milk shake. In order to use up all of the packs, I am going to try to add coffee to the milk to try to mask that funny taste."
2,Meh.,"For some reason my husband ordered a TON of this stuff for me for Christmas. We live in Chicago & it's cold so I didn't try it right away. I was craving something sweet so I finally made some tonight. It tastes like icy chocolate, & it's a bit chalky. To be honest it reminds me of the old powdered slimfast. I've got a whole canister and 5 packets of this stuff & I don't know what I'm going to do with it."
1,BUGS IN THE CHOCOLATE,I FOUND BUGS IN THE PACKETTE! IF YOU DONT LIKE BUGS YOU MIGHT NOT WANT THIS ITEM.
1,Terrible People,"It was pretty good the customer service was just bad, 3 of the 5 packs were broken and i got cut by the broken glass sent with it *nothing major* took 3 weeks and 130 cellphone minutes for them to tell me i will get free shipping on my next order. I tried the mix after that because they wouldint refund me anything and i am not allergic to chocolate but after drinking this product maybe 5 minutes after i started vomiting horridly. I let a friend try the other pack*he is also not allergic* He broke out so bad and started swellewing we had to bring him to the hospital. After 15 minutes on hold (at first the lady forgot to hit hold apparently they were very confused) i spoke with a manager and the only thing they could say was a simple sorry and they would send me another half off. I figured hey maybe it was just bad luck so i ordered another and this time instead of broken packets it was missing 3 packets and both spoons. I am really never ordering from this company again."
1,Roaches and Mice may be mixed in the chocolate,"I would like to remind everyone that the restaurant Serendipity 3 in NYC was closed down by the NYC Health DEPT some years ago beacause they were infested with roaches and mice, they found live roaches in the chocolate, they had to exterminate the entire place and reopened. But since they functioned in such disgusting conditions, how can you trust they are clean?Do a Google search: Serendipity 3 NYC roaches mice closedLots of info comes up, dont buy this."
3,Not as good as the First,Like other reviewers here I didn't think this book was as good as the first one. The author took a bit of a left turn and Genevieve wasn't up to her old antics quite as often. I did read it and I did finish it but if you're looking for a really good pap book then I would stick with the first one and take a pass on the second one.
2,More Memoirs of a Papillion: Diary of a Mad Dog,"I'm glad I bought this book as a paperback for I don't think it's a keeper. I lost so much interest in the story that I still haven't finished reading it. It just drags and is not near as light as the first one written. Analogy:No name makes it big with a sleeper, low budget movie and becomes a household name overnight.(Crowd roar). Next move, to do it again with a sequel. And we all know how that turns out. Sorry, this book was written with that exact scenario in mind so if you just have to have this book, find it at the second hand store for a dollar of let this site know that you have interest in taking it off my hands."
3,More Memoirs of a Papillon: Diary of a Mad Dog,"After reading ""Memoirs of a Papillon: The Canine Guide to Living with Humanswithout Going Mad"" I was very anxious to read Mr Fried's sequel. I wasdisappointed in his second effort. I felt it was more Mr. Fried'spholosphy on life and not enough anecdotes of Genevieve's life experiences.I couldn't put down the first book and laughed till my sides hurt. I evenbought several editions to give to friends. As a papillon owner, I couldreally relate to his firt book. I'm sorry to say, Mr Fried's second effortdidn't live up to his first. I hope he tries again."
4,A great movie for the time period,"I enjoyed so much Norman, is that you? The culture of 1976 - clothes, home furnishings, language, it brought back so many memories. I was delighted to see that even though the movie was made in 1976 the lingo they used and subject matter is totally relevant today. I was amazed. It was a movie ahead of its time, no doubt. It was tongue and cheek and great one liners. It was great to see the great Pearl Bailey with Redd Foxx. It was a cute movie that i show quite often now to friends who haven't seen it or even heard of it. I really wish it would come out on DVD. I don't know how much longer my VHS tape will hold out. I really do recommend it."
3,Camp to the max,"Kudos to Redd Foxx for taking this tired play and making it into a delightful little movie. Despite being a low budget production and the acting being a tad choppy, the story of the gay black son's coming out is handled with utter sensitivity. Norman's other half is a total scream. Don't miss the scene with the hooker. Hilarious!"
3,The title says it all.,"This CD is good for those who do not regularly collect classical CD's. If you don't really know much about classical music, but would like just a taste, this CD is for. This album is also good for those who love classical music, I bought it because it had all of my favorite classical works all on one CD. I can play a song at a get together and everyone there has heard the song some where at some point in their lives."
3,"Good, but not great selections given the title selected.","This CD contains some good pieces, but overall, the selections were not what I would have picked for a CD with this title. I used to think that I hated classical music, but now that I've sailed past 40 I have learned to enjoy it in almost every variety. Nevertheless, as a child of the Rock/Pop Music era, I can tell you most people today who think they hate classical music, think so because they've pretty much only heard the slower/less dramatic compositions. (I.e., ""elevator"" music.) The goal, of course, is to develop a real love for the genere, but in most cases, the introduction needs to be a ""grabber."" Perhaps I'm too skeptical, but while there is more than elevator music on this CD, I do not think it is on the whole upbeat or rythmatically appealing enough to sieze the interest of most of today's A.D.D. generation --- which is the presumable target audience."
3,Just OK.....,"The selections on this CD are kind of trite. I thought I would like this more than I did, but the old favorites are just familiar, nothing more. I like a cd that is all of a mood...this is too varied, but at the same time kind of boring. It is just what it says it is, so no complaints. I just wont listen to this often, like I would a favorite CD."
3,RE Guide to bass fishing: Central AZ Lakes,"While the book is dated, for Arizona bass fishing fanatics, it is important and valuable. The book identifies bass fishing techniques and some general locations across the various man-made lakes of central AZ, among some of the best bass fishing spots in the western US. The reservoirs have changed since the writing of the book but with pool fluctuations it can still provide insight."
3,Goosebumps DVD's,This books are so great and keep on through the generations. I wish the DVD's were as good as RL Stine wrote them...but in any case the kiddo's still dig 'em.
5,Thinking About the Blues,"This excellent book is a personal meditation on the recent and present Chicago blues scene by someone who knows it as well as anyone, and who thinks and writes about it much better than most. This is definitely not an introduction to the blues, but if you are a fan of the music, especially of the artists who are still getting it done in the Windy City, and if you have ever done any big picture musing on what the blues is all about, then this will give you a lot to muse about. I loved it."
5,A collection of revealing depictions of selected Chicago blues artists,"Chicago Blues: Portraits And Stories is a collection of revealing depictions of selected Chicago blues artists and true tales from the city's pubs and lounges, juxtaposed to reveal a vital and dynamic part of African-American culture. Written by the winner of the 2001 Keeping the Blues Alive Award for his journalistic achievements, Chicago Blues includes portraits of blues artists the author has personally known and the life stories of past pioneers. B/W photographs sparsely illustrate this eclectic and captivating account of venues such as East of Ryan and the Starlight Lounge, and artists such as Jumpin' Willie Cobbs, Harmonica Khan, pianist Sunnyland Slim, and many more."
1,Crap,"Here is an individual that wishes to close of most of our country for the exploitation of natural resources, and mostly the footprint of man. We would all be pushed into cities where the socialist-Marxist elites,could better ""manage"" the population, and limit its growth. Do we want to live in only urban environments where the limousine liberals control us? Think of how well this worked in the Warsaw ghettos of WWII. We must learn from history, and disallow this type of control else we are rats in their trap."
4,Plausible Deductions for Meanings of Arthurian Names,"This book is an advanced study into the origin and meanings of Arthurian names. I have to confess that I am strictly an amateur historical reader so some of the techniques and references in the book were new to me. I wasn't aware of the different dialects employed in England over time, so this gives you some idea of my perspective.The premise of the book is that various names give some clue to the historical people who may have been the basis for the legendary characters. Using linguistic techniques, which were new to me, but somewhat explained in the book (My failure to fully understand may be due to my own defeciencies rather than the book's -- someone in the field would undoubtedly grasp the ideas better), the author makes some logical deductions and educated guesses as to the meaning of the names of the characters, and how they were viewed by contemporaries.I believe this book to be essential to anyone who maintains an Arthurian library."
4,Holds Up Well,"This release has aged better than most of Phil Manzanera's solo ventures, with the exception of 801 Live. It contains some essential Eno tracks like Big Day and Miss Shapiro and showcases Manzanera as a top notch axeman, his notes drenched with sustain.There are some throwaway tracks here (Alma, Same Time Next Week), but overall this release is pretty darn good. Frontera--with Robert Wyatt providing vocals in Spanish--is awesome, as are the instrumentals The Flex, East of Echo and the title song. Fans of Brian Eno's 'rock' phase should definitely have this one in their collection.There rough edges and inconsistent tracks, but overall this is Manzanera's best solo effort. Many different styles coalecse into an organic whole.You can find many of these songs in different incarnations on 801 Live and on the jazz rock fusion release Mainstream, by Quiet Sun, of which Manzanera was a member during the mid-70s. That release is worth seeking out."
3,Features some Eno classics!,"If you like Eno, you must hear ""Big Day"" & ""Miss Shapiro."" These two songs and a few other cool instrumentals make this album HOT! If you like Roxy Music's early stuff, you'll like this! Manzanera shreds!"
5,The best season of The X-Files [1993-2002],"This is something i say with slight trepidation, but ultimately am convinced is true. This season was the peak of the series in so many ways, in terms of the acting of the two stars [David Duchovny earned an Emmy nomination for his role, and Gillian Anderson won], and not only in terms of production and directing of episodes ['Tempus Fugit' and 'Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man', respectively] but, perhaps most importantly, with regard to the story-lines, which were so rich and diverse, from the conspiracy arc of classics like 'Memento Mori' and 'Gethsemane' to stand-alone supernatural features such as 'Unrequited' and 'Synchrony'. This season also features a refreshing and I think unique number of conspiracy stand-alone episodes, (eg 'Memento Mori' 'Zero Sum' 'Demons' and 'Musings of a CSM'), which is perhaps what made '4' [pun intended] such a great season, and made '97 such a great year."
5,Lots of Extras in this set!,"Looks like The X-Files just keeps getting better and better with each DVD set they release. Season 4 is one of my favorite seasons, and this DVD set has so many extras on it, it's sure to be a best seller. There are 7 deleted scenes in this set including the previously unseen kiss between Mulder & Scully in ""Memento Mori"" :) That's worth the price right there!According to FOX there are plans to release every season, about 2 per year, so hopefully season 5 will be available around May 2002."
1,Misleading label,"The version of season 4 they sent me was in a cheap plastic case. The pictures posted for the Season 4 DVD are not what you get in the mail. They send you a cheap, single, clear, plastic case with the DVDs all stacked on top of each other.This is not what I thought it was going to be. If I wanted the cheap, single plastic case, I would have bought it from Wal-mart, who sells it for $10 cheaper.Let this be a warning for serious collectors."
3,Still not enough extras for such an expensive package...,"I bought the previous 'X-Files' DVDs, though the cost made me whimper. I've been consistently disappointed by the digital crawl of those editions, and annoyed that there weren't enough extras. Although you do get a good 20+ episodes for each box set, a set this pricey should have HOURS of extras/interviews/documentaries/etc. All of these sets are complacent - 'The Simpsons' Season 1 box set is a great example of how to do it right. After 3 previous tries, FOX still hasn't improved value-for-money. If you're a devoted fan, and if you have most of these wonderful episodes on tape, I advise you to abstain and make Fox WORK for your money."
1,Disturbing,"BY FAR the most disturbing X-Files episode I've ever seen...was NOT expecting that. Just plain sad. No science fiction, more like horror."
5,The Ultimate X-File Season,"Worth every cent, season four has all the great episodes that give the X-Files it's reputation; Herrenvolk, Home, Musings of a Cigarrette Smoking Man, Momento Mori and Gethsemane. The episodes rang from the grotesgue to the amusing. The chemistry between Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny comes out in this season and their excellant acting gives the fan what they expect from a top rated tv series."
4,"a little dramatic this season, but many gems","Mulder becomes more of a tough guy this season, the smoking man episodes are incredible, and the monster/mutant episodes (are) still pretty much (awful). At times I wanted to fastforward through Mulder and Scullys' speeches that seemed so forcefully poetic and wise (and long), but refrained. At any rate, there's alot of good stuff here and I can't say enough about the smoking man episodes, they're almost astonishing. Many solid sci-fi storylines throughout and there's an awesome two-parter. Definitely worth every penny of the purchase, even if only to miss an entire seasons' worth of commercials."
5,Probably the best season!!,This was probably the best season next to season two...it doesn't get any better than this.Everything from CSM to Krycek back to Skinner/Mulder and Scully is pure entertainment with a little bit of conspiracy.Its only when you get to season six where it seems the air is let out of this show.Season four is a definate must have on DVD!!!!!!!!!
4,"Excellent Purchase, Fast Delivery","The product was new, as it was described in the ad. It was delivered really fast even though I ordered it with the cheapest delivery. X-Files are very interesting, I am watching every season."
4,I want to believe!!!!,If you are a big 'X-Files' fan like I am then you definitely must add the fourth season to your collection!!!
5,Still going strong!,"To sum it up quickly, Season 4 makes the whole series a lot stronger. This season is just as intense as Season 3, as dark as Season 2, as serious as Season 1 and on top of that, it takes the mythology of the series, Mulder's quest for the truth, a step further. Things can't get any better than this. I highly recommend this item!"
1,x file 4th season,I am completely dissatisfied with your vendors. As you originally show I ordered this during the first week of January and never received it. I inquired with the company through you site and never got an email back however I finally determined that they returned my money for some reason but still never got a response from them. Then I ordered it through another vender and it was supposedly shipped on February 1st. Of course I am still waiting as of now for delivery of the item from them also. I have always hesitated ordering things on line because of these type of situations however my wife has always thought my thoughts were ridiculous. Maybe now I can change her point of view. I would appreciate any help you can give me with this situation.Jeff Rolfsen
1,Stiff and Clunky,"Despite the lanyard, this item is way to stiff to comfortably wear around your neck under your shirt, so I took the string off. It's not designed for diving, so I don't really know why I even bought it. My passport did fit into it, but I ended up using if for my dive log book, which just barely fit. The roll top seems like an unnecessary feature, and it doesn't seem to help keep the water out any more than the zip closure. It just makes it a hassle to open and get things out. Even though I didn't take it diving, a little water did seep in, but at least my stuff didn't get soaked. I would not buy one of these had I known what I know about it now."
2,Not waterproof for long...,"Product was shipped with no problems. However, after one day of usage in the resort pool, it didn't keep money dry. The plastic ripped at the top allowing water in."
4,Terrific story!,"The G'deon who ruled Shaftal died, without an heir. Thus Shaftal had been thrown into turmoil and the Sainnites began invading. The Shaftali created a guerrilla army to withstand the Sainnites, but slowly they began to lose.Emil was a Paladin and of fire blood. Zanja was the Speaker for people, also of fire blood. Norina was a Truthken and an air elemental. Karis was a giant, worked as a metalsmith, and an earth witch. These four souls would be called upon by Fate to determine the course of their people.**** The story followed Zanja as she and the others dealt with war, torture, honor, politics, betrayal, lots of courage, and a bit of friendship. There were parts that left me breathless. Often reality intruded upon my reading and I found myself eager to return to this magical world as quickly as possible. Author Laurie J. Marks proves her talent for creating realistic characters and awesome plots! Recommended! ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch."
5,Fantastic!,"I really enjoyed this book - the plot, the characters, the setting. Unlike some other reviewers, I was pleased to find that the main characters were not heterosexual. So many (and I mean SO MANY) other books rarely, if ever, feature gays and lesbians at all, much less as main characters. It's refreshing to find strong characters in this book who also happened to be gay and lesbian.I also enjoyed figuring out the gender of other characters. I caught myself assuming that this farmer or that councilor were male...and assuming wrongly!Can't wait to read the next few in the series!"
2,Good and Bad,"When I first began reading Fire Logic, I was immediately drawn in to the world created. It was interesting and imaginative. I've read similar stories before, but regardless it was well written. After coming to the end however I realized that I simply didn't enjoy the book. The reason was simply, because the author decided to push homosexuality. There was no need for it. It didn't advance the story in any way, it was just there. Had the author simply switched the genders of Zanja and Medric, the story would have deserved a great rating. Because the author chose to try to push homosexuality though, it went from being a good book to a crappy one. I finished reading it, but I won't bother with the sequels. Knowing the authors proclivities, they aren't worth reading."
5,This book helps me SEE...,"Once I traveled to Japan with a friend who simply didn't have the same experience as I did while there. Where I saw beautiful temples and searched for some sort of ""deeper meaning"", she saw beautiful guys and whined about being hungry every three hours without fail. A book like Pilgrimage can help any traveler see the beauty of the landscape, of the culture, and of spiritual places with better eyes and a more perceptive spirit. I wish I could have painted watercolors like this during my travels, to Japan and elsewhere. I would have learned to slow down and look.He's a pretty good writer too. It is interesting to read about Afghanistan when it was peaceful.This is a very beautiful book about very beautiful places. It cheers me up when I feel bored. My friends love to look through it. So I hope that you can find a copy for yourself."
4,job interview book,"I have always loved this book and have bought it and lent it out to friends many times over. I feel very confident that it has been a key factor in many of the jobs I was able to land. Great advice and way of looking at a question and turning it on a positive tip. Some answers seem a little heavy-handed or brown-nosey, but I think overall, as long as it can be said naturally fro you, it's a plethora of good ideas."
1,Waste of money,"It's not so much the questions that are the problem, but rather the suggested answers. Most are laughable, and no sensible person would ever use them (if they really wanted the job, that is). This book is a joke......I would never recommend it to anyone."
2,Outdated,"I found the suggestions in this book to be outdated and sometimes plain foolish. Noone in today's competitive marketplace would use the answers suggested by this book (not unless they didn't want to get a job in the first place!) If you want useful tips and strategies on how to present yourself in a professional manner(instead of personal or humorous as Porot suggests), read Robin Ryan's ""60 Seconds and You're Hired!"". It offers some great insights into the art of ""situational"" interviewing."
5,Wish I'd said that!,"I'm helping a friend going through a career transition; we are using this book to practice interviewing as we commute to our current jobs. The format is great: specific questions and suggested responses get us talking about what we'd like our supervisors to know about our skills and working styles. We have both noticed we're getting better at communicating our abilities where we are. The suggested answers are forthright, positive, and allow the focus to be on the job."
2,Good for an entry level only...,"This book is good for a quick read and entry level. If you are a professional that has worked for any number of years, this book is probably too elementary for you. However, this book quickly outlines key questions for the beginner."
5,Candy for the ear,There is nothing like having a songbird to sing to you whenever you want. Thanks for being a great provider of great music!
2,Slogging through Hindi,"There is some serious slogging here. You can start right into the conversational, but each chapter is *so* dense that you don't feel like you are touching bottom! The beginners hindi version of this book is a *much* better version..."
5,A pioneer's aid,"For my ministry I need to learn Hindi. I am still going through the course, but I feel this is the best teach yourself program on Hindi out there that will really teach you something without wasting your money. Buy the complete course, which is a textbook and 2 CD's. It will actually teach you what the words mean, not just to memorize phrases without knowing the individual words, so you can in time form your own sentances. The book does move a bit fast, but this is a really good, intensive course for someone who is serious about learning the Hindi language. This book also teaches you how to pronounce and read Hindi. Although I still have much to learn, already with what I have learned from this course I find that Hindi speakers can understand what I say."
2,Goes WAY too fast,"I consider myself intelligent, and I am even a foreign language teacher, but I could NOT keep up with this book. The first few pages teach you the alphabet (in Hindi script), then the book starts with dialogues, all in Hindi script, with no English translation, and there are about 20 new vocab words to learn every lesson, ONLY in Hindi script--unless you are already adept at reading this, it moves way too fast."
2,Complicated,I was more interested in learning to speak hindi not write it. A few chapters into the book it requires that you learn to understand hindi writing so the book was no good to me after that. Also the basics are covered very quickly in the first two chapters. It moved much too fast for me.
4,Good book for beginners,"I bought this for my hindi class and it has been quite helpful. It has the hin-glish translations, as well as hindi script and english translations. Easy to understand and the cd's pretty good."
1,Very Disappointing,There are better Hindi Book / CD combos out there. I ordered this one because I was going to India and I am very disappointed. The course was not organized well and very boring.Don't bother wasting your time and money on this. Find a different product.
5,Best Book Out There,"Snell's Teach Yourself Hindi is an exceptional beginner's text. It would be stronger though with more emphasis on learning how to write in Devanagari script. Other than this problem (which can be easily overcome with the companion book, another similar book, or the help of a native speaker), the book is exceedingly more useful that most of its type. The grammar explanations and exercises are extremely useful. Snell's text can also be very useful to those who already have some basic grasp of Hindi. It covers many topics in grammar and usage that are absent from other books."
4,Teach yourself Hindi,"I bought this book and dvd for my grand-children who did not know one word of Hindi or any other Indian language. As their grand-mother's national language, they wanted to learn atleast a few phrases of Hindi language.After receiving this book, they really learned a few conversational phrases fast and loved the book. I highly recommend this title."
5,Outstanding!,"I am a total beginner, but this book and CD set is fantastic! It is well-paced, and critically, it's also well-structured, providing focused instruction that keeps you moving forward without overwhelming you. It really is hard to fault this set, and if you are looking for a course that gets you well underway from zero, this is it."
3,Great Text Small Print,"As a student of the ""Cloud"" for many years I appreciate having this text in my library, especially since it includes the ""The Mystical Theology of St. Denis,"" ""The Book of Privy Counselling,"" and ""An Epistle on Prayer."" However, the type face is so small that my 65 year old eyes tire easily when attempting to read it. If you're subject to eye strain, I'd recommend William Johnston's edition of ""Cloud"" and ""Privy"" or the ""Cloud"" from the ""Classics of Western Spirituality"" put out by Paulist Press along with its companion volume, ""The Pursuit of Wisdom,"" containing other works by the ""Cloud's"" author. In any case, no student of contemplative prayer/meditation should be anything but thoroughly familiar with the treasure these texts contain."
4,One man's defence of the contemplative lifestyle,I enjoyed this book because I think I am searching for some kind of mystical escape from the dreary realities of everyday life; the author of this book (unknown) certainly gives permission for that. I think it is fair to say that he totally defends this way of life; the only drawback is I am left with the age old problem that it would be great to live a life of contemplation and glorious devotion to God but who pays the bills or looks after the kids at the end of a strenuous day. This book has a lilting humour woven into the author's down to earth prose style. In comparison to Mother Julian of Norwich he is veritably a stand up comic.
5,THE Solution for Toilet Bowl/Hard Water Stains,"We have well water/hard water, which tends to leave an unsightly ring in our toilet bowls, which I cannot stand. This is the only thing that I have found to keep the toilets looking brand-new! These scouring sticks are super easy to use and have never scratched our toilet bowls (as I had worried they would when I first began using them). I simply put on long rubber gloves, wet the stick, and gently scrub away the hard water stains. It creates a ""paste buildup which helps to clean and polish"" (excerpt from product box). While there is a bit of residue/particles from the pumice stick, it is fine enough to be flushed away (2 or 3 flushes). I highly recommend this Pumie Scouring Stick to anyone who gets hard water stains in their commodes, it's extremely effective (and cheap)!"
1,Nope not good!,"I think that this book is very innacurate and bias and should not be allowed to be published for the innacuracy and offence that gives us, the ""antagonist"" in the book."
1,Bland and Biased,"I would have strong hesitations suggesting this book. It does not seem well researched. If you are interested in new religions, find another book."
1,Terrible!,"I have never read such a terrible book! These people are not even fully educated in their topics. And they are SO biased, it's not even funny. Don't waste any money on this book at all!"
1,Ignorance is bliss..,"Since when does an ""encyclopedia"" repeatedly compare its listings to Christian beliefs and tenets? With Christianity proving itself to be ""better"" each time? This book is no encyclopedia but is merely a Christian apologetic, and a very poorly researched one at that."
4,Great for seniors,I'm retired and I while I wanted to get email I did not want to learn about computers. I bought an i-Mac because I heard they were good for novices and they were right! My grandson hates it because he can't play his games... one more reason I love it! :^)So I think this is perfect for retired people who don't need all the latest gizmos but just want to write letters and send email. Of courrse all the ladies in my golf circle think it's darling and I think it's just really cute. In fact I am trying to get my husband to paint it pink!I did subtract one star because the first one I took home broke down in the first week. But I took it back and got another one and it's working just fine.
4,Awesome!!!!,"This is my favorite scooby-doo episode. Daphne buys a mask and the ""zombie"" tries to steal it back. This video has awesome ""one-liners"" from scooby and the gang. A ""must have movie!"""
5,Hilarious!,"This is one of my favorite episodes of Scooby Doo, and I've seen practically every one. I always crack up when Scooby's chasing after the baddies in their car. A must-have for any Scooby fans."
4,Chinese ghosts and haunted mansions - must be Scooby Doo,"I've had this tape since I was a kid and still pop it in from time to time. The creativity of the villains and settings always drew me in despite the formulaic plots. The tape contains two Scooby episodes and a Powerpuff Girls episode as a bonus. Mystery Mask Mixup has some fun moments as the gang is hounded by zombies in Chinatown for a golden mask Daphne purchased. What the Hex Going On? is the stronger episode in my opinion. The opening scene gave me goosebumps every time as a kid, as did the prospect of one of the characters being cursed and aging to an old man in seconds. The story goes that an old mansion is being haunted by a ghost looking to take a family fortune by threatening the family with old age. Its actually better than how I've made it sound. Decent, quality entertainment for kids and nostalgia-filled adults."
3,Water Meter Key,"Will work for now, but must have been made NOT in the USA - doesn't have a nice smooth finish, and weld at key end is iffy..."
1,Leggen tights,"If you order these, you better be super thin. As it looses its color if you have any meat on you. Was very disapointed. In the package it is nice and colorfull but when you put it on the color stretches making it look funny and i am not considered to be over weight."
1,Belongs in a trash can!,This is absolutely the WORST boy band there is. Their mediocre voices and elementary dancing moves are an insult. I hope my trash can can swallow this awful DVD. What a waste of money!
4,AWESOME CONCERT/ THESE MEN ARE GREAT,"If I could of watched it, Amazon claims this plays on region 1 dvd. I have a region 1 dvd, it won't play. I could only play it on my computer. I have been a fan of Westlife since 1998. These men are the best at what they do."
1,Don't think it is the real product,"The product was shipped from Hongkong where as I know has lots of fake kose products. Every time I use it I can smell alcohol which I don't think Kose Medicated Sekkisei should contain.I did a research about kose all it's products should have four digital product number, but this one has six!"
2,Interesting read,"A very good review of this book was written by Tatyana Tolstaya - you can find it in her collections of essays entitles ""Pushkin's Children"". After reading it, I can't wait to read Sheehy's book - just to enjoy all the fallacies of it (e.g. Sheehy's referring to Tatar-Mongols as two separate groups)."
2,A lot for very lilttle,"These were great while they lasted but after about six months, they no longer closed properly, and it wasn't as though I had attempted to do anything other than tweeze hairs (no jewelry, repair, for instance or anything else). I contacted Rubis to see about repair and I never heard back. So I kissed my $30 goodbye."
4,Best tweezers I have found thus far.,"I own a lot of tweezers. Many. Most of them work on par with each other, i.e, not very well. They will get the larger hairs but have trouble grasping the finer ones. These tweezers work infinitely better than most and have a very sharp and precise edge, they get almost all the hairs I want. I have yet to try another reviewers advice of having them re-calibrated by the company (as thus far there has been no need) but I intend to if ever they lose their edge.I found this info through another review. Will update if I ever try it.(Mehaz Service Center, 19669 East Lake Shore, Bigfork, MT 59911. Include $3.00 for shipping)"
1,camera doesnt start!,this has been such an appaling and painful experienceI purchase the kit from amazon and the camera refuses to work. it doesnt even starti wonder what kind of credentials the seller has .. and how such a thing can continue without actioni have initiated process of notifying people at the wonderful 47th street watever (the seller) and the canon service centresthis is easily my first and last purchase with amazonregards
2,best of the early years,"gato barbieri has definitely improved over the years. i never heard any of these songs and couldn't have recognized that they were his. However, i didn't spend much money, and since it was an enlightenment, i am o.k. with the purchase."
1,Biospot is no good,I put Biospot on my dog on Saturday and Wednesday she still had fleas. Its suppose to last for 4 weeks - it didn't even last for 4 day. Not only that but it leaves a gross oily patch where ever I apply it. Worst flea product ever!!!
5,Great Flea and Tick Prevention Product!,I think this is a wonderful product and it does the job for much cheaper than other flea and tick products that do essentially the same thing.
2,Garrett Pro-Scan Scanner Metal Detector,Poorly made battery enclosure lid falls off or apart and plastic handle material slippery in harsh conditions. The super scanner model has definitely worked better with its no slip handle and other features.
4,good strap,"Like the other reviewers have mentioned, the strap does have a gasoline scent to it. Washed it but the scent remained albeit to a lesser degree. If you don't mind that, it's a good strap. Works for what it is and for the price it can't be beat."
4,"A good,readable,working guide to TCP/IP Socket","I used this book from cover to cover in a Unix Socket Programming class. A few good points about this book: 1) The sample do compiled on Linux with no problems. That's a plus. 2) The author emphasized good client-server design principles. 3) The introduction is gentle and very readble. 4) The code sample is directly,simple and not riddled with unnecessary details to ""show off"" like some authors do.You don't need much Unix to do exercise in this book.About the only System calls you need to know are fork(),Select(),sigalarm() and execve(). The book could have been expanded to cover HTTP,SOAP and some other protocols to give it a 5stars."
5,Excellent Resource for Learning and Understanding TCP/IP,This is perhaps the best-written technical book I have ever read. I didn't know squat about networking or TCP/IP before I read this book and now I consider myself quite prepared to write client and server applications. Comer and Stevens spare the theoretical and abstract and supply plenty of real-world examples (and code) that make learning the subject enjoyable and effective.
2,Intonation difficulties and sterile mix...,"Is it just me, or are there just too many intonation ""disagreements"" on too many tracks? The All Stars include a number of pro brass luminaries, but the arrangements are too ""corps"" style for my taste. That said, in an age when BLAST is on Broadway, maybe I'm just not willing to compromise that much. They all play extremely well, of course, but the mix is ""in your face""--a studio mix that doesn't do brass instruments justice. Maybe this project suffered from the ears of the producer, or it was cranked out in a hurry. In any case, I'm disappointed."
2,garbage,"I thought I was going to be reading about a philosophical discussion on religion. What I got was Jesus talk. I'm glad Jesus could take some time to help the poor lady, but perhaps he should concentrate on bigger issues that threaten civilization as a whole."
5,"A nice, short read",This is a nice reminder of the things that we tend to forget or don't quite understand in the first place. It's not overly preachy. I really enjoyed this book because it addresses many questions that I have had.
5,A Perfect Follow-Up...,"I started this book immediately after finishing 'Dinner With a ...' and really enjoyed it. I love the message of these books...that having a relationship with God does not need to be as difficult as many religions make it out to be. I am not a religious person, in fact, I'm Mattie. I have the exact same skepticism she had. I question all the same things, but these books have actually given me a lot to think about.Mattie and Nick are no different from many of us...a small family trying to get through life. Nick wrapped up in work (until his dinner with Jesus, that is), and Mattie resenting him for being gone so much, and leaving her to basically raise their two year old daughter by herself. Both of them know something is missing in their lives, but it turns out to be the last thing they think...God. Overall, I absolutely recommend this, and it's companion book. They are extremely quick reads that pack quite a punch."
4,4 1/2 stars,I really enjoyed this book. I read in a few hours. I felt the book had some great insight to how people really think and feel and how to put the idea of God and religion into perspective. It's definetly a book I would read again and would highlight some food for thought.
4,Day with a Perfect Stranger,This is one of the few books that you just don't want it to end. It is a short but great read!
2,Not A Perfect Book with a Perfect Stranger,"I read this as part of a discussion group. It left me disappointed. While the theology fits with my take on things, the concept was absurd. I agree with those who regard this book as fluff. I wanted something more challenging. I would suggest this would be a good book for a high school group, not an adult discussion."
5,the book of books,"As a C++ programmer, I thought ""Director? Lingo? UUUHHHH! just another primitive script language."" After working with Director for 2 years Bruce's book showed me that Lingo is not just another primitive dumb script language. This book ( i own about ten books about Director and Lingo + the oringinal documentation) showed me hidden features of the language, I never thought that they even existed.Full score, Bruce. By the way: If you are an absolute beginner, this should not be the first book you ever read about director."
1,"This book is, simply, terrible...","I can't emphasize enough how I would encourage readers NOT to purchase this book. Not only is it out of date (to no fault of its author), but it is incredibly disorganized (directly the fault of its author). This, however, is not unusual for O'Reilly books which are notorious for a general lack of order and the inclusion of irrelevant material. Should you ignore my advice, I'm certain you'll find yourself flipping back and forth as you read each chapter in succession, as nothing is covered (""Refer to Chapter X for details on X"" is something you run into practically on every page) in cohesive chunks. And you'll also get other useful tips like ""Experiment until you have a firm grasp of when the different handlers in different scripts are being called or until you are totally confused. Then start with new movie, and try it all again."" That little gem applies equally as well to reading the book as it does to handling Lingo's archaic structure..."
5,Simply the best resource going.,"""Lingo in a Nutshell"" and its companion book ""Director in a Nutshell"" are an incredible source and wealth of valuable information. If you have learned some of the fundamentals of Director and wish to expand your horizons, these books are a must have. I always recommend these books as must read to my students here at the Vancouver Film School - New Media Campus. The fact that it covers Lingo only to Director 6.5 should be of no hindrance. It all still applies and is 100% relevant to Director 7. If you want to get the best out of your Lingo, BUY THIS BOOK. Excellent job Bruce and Thanks!"
5,The Best Lingo Resource,"I had gained more insigt into lingo by the end of the first chapter of this book than I had by the time I finished the three others I had bought before, if you need to do lingo, this is a one stop book, no need go anywhere else. What really makes this book even better than the already well writen and defined resource that it is, if you have a questions, the author will actually help you answer them, and all this for half the price of most books. if there is a better deal out there I havent found it. THIS IS THE BOOK."
5,Lingo in a Nutshell,"This is a wonderful book, but don't make the samae mistake I did. I didn't look close enough, and it is OUTDATED. It is for Director 6. The most recent version is 8.5...and they are totally different."
1,Lingo in a Nutshell - OUTDATED,"Beware if you're buying this book, it covers lingo up to version 6, and director's most recent version is 8.5."
4,At the time it was a goodie...,This one sat next to the 'Bible' in class and at home. The Lingo dictionary if you would...Now to see if they have an updated version.
2,Nothing special is done with language,"Reading a recent poem in the New Yorker by Vijay Seshadri, Thought Problem, I picked up The Long Meadow with long expectations. Unfortunately, this collection of poems has little punch. Seshadri does nothing new with language; the words he uses, the choice of language, the pacing, has little sense of drama or urgency. The topics he explores do not break new thematic ground. All and all, this collection is flat and uninspiring. A disappointing effort, this book leaves the reader wondering why this should be read; and why this was published at all."
1,"Wrong sizes, Slow Shipping, Terrible customer Service","I bought 5 curious george shirts. Large size actually smaller than another shirt I got from old Glory that was a small. ridiculous customer service. Their excuse was they don't actually make their shirts--they just sell them. So they don't stand behind their product and won't send a return postage paid label to make up for thier admittedly faulty products. After going through the supervisor, the same feeling came across-buyer beware! also, quality of shirt was certainly not worth $29. Don't buy from this company."
2,"wrinkles, puckers at seams","This set wrinkles quite badly after washing (I've washed them 3 times and still wrinkly) and the single-thread seam along the topsheet and pillowcases has puckered (maybe from the dryer? the thread should have been pre-dried before sewing), making the wrinkles even more obvious. They are thick, though, and feel heavy-duty; no pilling (yet) and I like the sateen feel. The bone is a bit brighter than the picture (looks more apricot)."
1,Appologist for a dictator: dishonesty in its pure state,The journalistic integrity of Francois Soudan has long been disputed by african affaires experts. This book of his is additional proof for that charge. Soudan fails to address the racial massacres committed against black Mauritanians and the ethnic purges within the army. Nor does he inform his readers of the deportation of black Mauritanians who were shipped across the border back in 1989 because of their ethnicity. The reader should not expect to find any information about the inumerable human right abuses and the profoundly corrupt Mauritanian regime. This is a book written on-demand to deceive westerners about the true nature of the rule of Colonel Maaouiya Ould Sid'Amed Taya.
4,"Good gift, could be one star better","I say one more star better if it had an aux input for a mp3 device. Then it would be perfect. My dad got this for me two years ago for Christmas. Not our taste to be honest but it was cool, too cool to do away with it. It's now out in the dinning area of the house and I use it more often than I thought I would. Like I said though, if only I could plug in my ipod it would be perfect! :)"
3,SOUND,This unit has a very nice appearance but the sound is poor! The speaker system sounds like a transistor radio not good at all! There is no way to adjust it better. It is rather poor quality!
3,A good little jukebox but could be better for the 21st century,"I gave this 3 stars because it's a very cool looking item but The novelty wears off after a while but it still looks great. The sound is a little rustic but it is no Stereo Sound System and wont sound very loud in a large room. I will probably get myself a better sounding system in the future. I have had this for 2 months and the sound has started to turn itself up and down when I first turn it on. Giving it a slight bang makes it work. It's like the 90s again. If you must buy one, I suggest buying one for the man cave, garage or gym unless you really want to show it off in the lounge."
5,Nostalgic!,Bought this item as a gift for my daughter for her apartment. She loves it and her roommates love it too. Really adds a retro feeling to their little bar area. Sounds great...no problems.
2,All Show,"For a substantial size wooden box the sound was very tinny. For a small plastic box the sound would still have been tinny. Also, no headphone jack. All show."
1,BAD,"I purchased this item and plugged it into my power point using a converter adapter for Australian Standards. A soon as I plugged It in It """"BLEW UP IN SMOKE IMMEDIALTLY"""" IT NO LONGER WORKS """" I DIDNT GET A CHANCE TO SEE IT PLAY """" I DIDNT GET A CHANCE TO HERE IT PLAY """"WHY WOULD A COMPANY SELL ELECTRICAL ITEMS TO AUSTRALIA THAT ARE NOT COMPATABLE !!!!!!!WHY WOULDNT THE COMPANY TELL YOU THAT YOU CANNOT USE THIS IN AUSTRALIA !!!!I USED AN ADAPTER !!!WHY DID IT BLOW UP!!!!!!MY FRIEND BROUGHT ONE AS WELL, SHE LIVES IN AUSTRALIA TO AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENEDIT BLEW UP BOOM !!!!!!!WE BOTH LOST TOGETHER OVER $300.00WERE THE ITEMS FAULTY !!!!!!WERE THEY JUST NOT COMPATABLE FOR AUSTRALIAWHY WERE WE NOT ADVISED????THEY KNEW WERE THEY WERE SENDING THEM!!!!!!!I AM VERY SAD AND SO IS MY FRIEND!!!!!!!!!!!Pyrus Electronics 4gb Mp3 / mp4 / mp5 Player with 2.8 Inch Touch Screen and All Stainless Steel Casing"
3,Gorgeous Jukebox,LOVE the way it looks - it has the place of honor in my kitchen. The sound reception isn't so hot when the radio is on.
3,Crosley Jukebox CD Player,"This is a very cute little machine. Very happy with this, except for the sound.But, it is a good value for the product."
1,Scooper a Bit Unwieldy,I bought this scooper not realizing how large it would be. I have kept it but find I rarely use it because it's really too cumbersome for bringing pasta from pot to bowl.
4,Nice flatiron,"This is great for short hair. Very controllable, but a note--it gets very hot, very fast. Unless you have steel plated hair, don't use it at the highest setting.I use this with the Soya products and they keep the hair healthy while this tool keeps it very straight all day long."
3,Handle gets Slippery,"This is perhaps one of the nicest looking knives after the Wusthof Culinar design. However, the handles of this Grand Prix line do get slippery while cutting meat when my hand got wet or when the juice from the meat gets onto my hand. Plus, the handle is shorter in length than the Henckels 4star line. So if you're looking for the perfect functioning knife (scrificing on the looks a bit), go for the Henckels 4 star line."
5,This was $25 at the show (it was a GREAT show),"this is a super price compared to the cost of $25 if you buy at the show in vegas. p.s. dont miss the show, it is incredible!"
5,One of the best I've heard all year!,"Having seen the stage performance of Mystere, one of the best parts of the spectacular show was the music. It's different, but it's great and I'd suggest it to anyone who wants to try something new."
5,A review from a Mystere Frequent Flyer :^),"Okay so I've seen Mystere at least 6 times ... the first time I saw the show I literally RAN outside to purchase the tape, then after about the 3rd time I bought the CD, then I think after the 4th they had the LIVE CD to buy. The reviewer that said that this CD doesn't have the Drum Session is correct, in fact when I originally purchased it, it was for the Drums but alas I loved it anyway. I've purchased all my copies from [local retailer] and paid some incredible amount so imagine my surprise to find it available here on Amazon.I've bought other Cirque CD's since and must say this is still my favorite."
4,"Te live version is better, but this is still an excellent CD","The music initially seems new age, and weird, but after several listenings, you appreciate the sophistication and variety.Taken by itself, the CD *is* very good, and provides some great background mood music.The studio feel detracts from the overwhelming punch the live presentation has. For example, this CD lacks the opening drum act. If you've seen the show at Treasure Island, you'll remember the intensity of the pounding from all directions. Similarly, the violins in Kunya Sobe are a little *too* centered (in the live, they're very widely spaced from the center).The original CD didn't have ""Taiko,"" which is the opening drum piece. The live performance is definitely worth seeing, especially for the intense and rhythmic pounding coming from every direction."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!,"""TWENTIETH CENTURY"" is a must have for any ALABAMA FAN. God Must Have Spent A Little Time On You is great. The song ""Twentieth Century"" is about the past 100 yrs. and all the changes we have seen. There have to be a few more #1 Hits on this album."
3,alabama is really improving on their music.,alabama through the years have had good music but in the past two or three years they have really improved with their selections. this album has a real good chance with the song God Must Have Spent A Little More Time With You. it touches the heart.
5,Great CD!! We can't get enough of Alabama music.,The songs are great - and brings back a lot of memories. The background of Insync was a good idea too! Looking forward to seeing them perform the new stuff soon!!
5,Alabama at their finest!!,"These guys are soooo Y2K compliant ... free AOL software, songs about our lives (that we can relate to!) and the 20th Century song. ""WE'LL ALL BE SURFING ON THE INTERNET!!"""
5,ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING!!!!,"IT IS OKAY TO PUT ALABAMA IN THE SAME SENTENCE AS THE TEMPTATIONS AND THE BEATLES. THE HARMONIES, THE FEELING, THE VARIETY OF SONG SUBJECTS. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN ALABAMA FANS SINCE THE BEGINNING, CAN'T WAIT FOR NEW WORK TO COME OUT. IT KEEPS GETTING BETTER. TWENTIETH CENTURY IS CERTAINLY A TREAT TO LISTEN TO. THE SONGS AND THE VOICES HAVE NEVER SOUNDED BETTER OR FRESHER. AFTER SO MANY YEARS, ALABAMA HASN'T LOST A STEP. THEY MIGHT NOT BE AS YOUNG AND FLASHY AS SOME OF THE OTHERS BUT THE MUSIC IS FAR SUPERIOR. LIKE THE OTHER FAMOUS GROUPS, ALABAMA MUSIC WILL LIVE ON LONG AFTER THE GROUP IS NO LONGER MAKING MUSIC. HOPEFULLY, THERE WILL BE YEARS OF NEW MUSIC. GREAT JOB!!!!!!!!!"
2,Snooze Fest,"Definitely would take advantage of the ""Look Inside!"" on this one.I'm convinced it could be written better than it is.I'm sorry I can't recommend any substitutes."
1,for academics only ???,"In this book the original chinese text and extensive footnotes take up about two thirds of each page, the remainder has to suffice for the english translation. This does not make for an easy read so unless you are a dedicated scholar I would look elsewhere for Mencius's views. That is what i will be doing, passing this version on to the people at Goodwill charities, I hope they can make better use of it. An academic might well give this a 5 star rating, and perhaps i should have read the description more carefully, but as a lay reader I found this book far too specialized."
4,Very enjoyable book,"Trattoria is a wonderfully fun book. It's funny (I found myself laughing out loud several times), sexy, romantic and so enjoyable that as soon as I finished it, I turned right back to the beginning and started it again. If you're looking for a book that is engaging and full of life, then Trattoria is for you!"
2,Trattoria,"Tired of seeing their flighty sister's heart broken due to her shallow choices, Cy and Lucy decide to help her by buying her a date with Dan, an aspiring actor who earns a living waiting tables. Since, the sister, Val, is pretty, this is not an extreme hardship, however, his attraction to Lucy does hinder his enjoyment of the situation somewhat. Though this dating scenario gives Val some much needed self-confidence, the expense begins to raise Cy's blood pressure, perhaps in part due to the financial woes of their family resteraunt. Love and money combine in this recipe for entertainment as each sibling pursues happiness. However, two things detract from the mix. A bit less salt in the language would have vastly improved things, as would using a different point of view. The second person perspective is rather disjointed to read and may turn many readers away."
4,He is up and coming!,"I spent a Summer on Cape Cod in 1996, and a friend of mine went to this little coffee shop in Hyannis and heard this guy named Peter Mulvey, do a few numbers on his guitar. She fell in love, bought the CD and made me listen to it...over, and over , and over again! I fell in love with his music as well! He is an up and coming star, so be one of the first to have heard this guy before he hits the big time!"
4,Quick and satisfying read,"Like the other Lily Wu / Janice Cameron books, this is a pleasant read, with a little more Chinese cultural references than Hawaiian this time. A few too many characters made it a little confusing along the way, but it was enjoyable, and you learn a little about the tea trade in the 1950's."
3,Compact and worth the price,"Received a pair of these for X-mas. They are more difficult to set up, change channels, and other functions than my Cobra 250's, so keep the instruction book handy. (the reason for only 3 stars) Have used all four a few times at a local airport flea market and in malls with good results. I really like the rechargeable batteries. Charge 'em up overnight & use 'em all day. Too bad the call feature doesn't work between different brands of radios. If this is important to you, buy all the same brand."
4,Great radio,"I just bought these radios today. I had a little trouble getting used to how to change channels and the like. Also, the menu felt clumsy.I haven't got the chance yet to try them out over a distance, but I expect them to perform well.My favorite feature: the call feature (which DOES work between brands) has different tones to choose from, even songs!!"
4,Well not exactly but great for newcomers.....,This CD is excellent for introducing classical music to those unfamiliar with the genre. This is a collection of the most popular classical tunes that you have heard everwhere but don't recognize by name. Use this CD for what it is...a stepping stone.
4,"No, the title lies a viscious lie.","It has some very decent stuff, though mainly just the most popluar things. Get it if your starting out listening to classical. Otherwise, youll own all the songs anyway most likely."
3,A Crash Course in Classical Music,"This CD is for the novice to musical style. It is a reasonably good start. It introduces you to the familiar sounds and pieces you have already heard before. Some pieces were poorly recorded for no obvious reason. However, you may enjoy it while driving to conceal the traffic noise!"
5,Very musical voice,"I enjoyed listening to this CD. It is moments pretty sad but lyrical. The voice of the artist is very good, musical and rich."
4,very sturdy and comfortable seat covers,"These are very durable and sturdy seat covers compared to anything else I could find for under a couple hundred bucks. They will fit most bucket seats BUT they are a little snug on the over-sized power buckets in my 2001 F150 Lariat XLT 4x4 Supercab because of the extreme width of the lower seatback. I had difficulty pulling them down all the way, so they were a few inches above where the back and the seat come together. But after setting on them for a couple weeks they have stretched down into place without ripping out anywhere. Amazing!! I'm a bit over 6' and about 230lbs, so that's a lot of stress they handled!I liked them so much I bought a second pair just in case something damaging happens to one of them.I would have given them 5 stars if they hadn't been so hard to put on OR the company had warned about problems with over-sized buckets. I CAN'T be the first person to have brought this up to them............"
4,Bent Fender,"See storyline above.When Bill Fitzhugh writes a book, you never know what you’re going to get. This time around he writes a somewhat scathing story of Nashville and the country music industry.It seems as though Fitzhugh’s novels are becoming progressively less funny (laugh out loud). They may be less funny but the stories are still fun to read. Even though this story has no laugh out loud parts it is dosed with some little humorous gems (Jimmy’s description of a Gulf Coast casino as feeling like he was in a Dukes of Hazard pinball machine). Fender Benders is an entertaining and eye opening look at the workings of the country music industry and will make you look at Nashville in a whole new light.Recommended."
4,"A Fast, Fun Run through Nashville","Bill Fitzhugh is a natural storyteller. He uses his clever twist of a phrase with detailed research to put you in the recording studio, in a meeting with Music Industry con men, sucking fried Shrimp from a backwater diner, and all the while trying to figure out who dun it! A fast fun read - almost as enjoyable as Pest Control - but no complaints here!"
3,Not A mystery,A Good story about the ins and outs of making a living playing music. Interesting charcters. But in no way a mystery. You never find out who did it.
1,Fender Benders,I threw the book away after I finished. Until this afternood I was a fan of mr. Fitzhugh's and have read all of his books. I can only guess that he found himself on page 300 and needed to finish the book as quickly as possible. He wasted so much of my time setting up things that never payed off and then says it's just one of lifes mysterys. It was just a weird coincidence. In my book that is bad writing.
5,gift for my grandson,loves Goosebumps nowi am trying to get him interested in reading the books so i started with the movie
4,DVD,"Bought this video for my kids. they are a big fan of Goosebumps. We all enjoyed this one . As always it was appropriate for kids--not TOO scary or gory, just enough to make it fun!"
2,so much to say so little,"This was a funny mistake; I placed this book on hold thinking it was a cookbook. It is, in fact, a very bad novel."
1,Much Ado About NOTHING,"I could not finish it. What a silly international conspiracy revolving around a pastry chef and her secret recipe for chocolate cake. Who cares?!?! The Buddhist, Japanese, and WTO aspects to the story seemed to be artificially planted. Pierre the French chef was a caricature. This was a most disappointing book. The only salvageable part was the many descriptions of scrumptious pastries. Other than that, this book was an utter disappointment."
1,"Sunya, indeed","Ironic that the main character's name is Sunya ('zero' or 'nothing' in Sanskrit). Well actually it is a beautiful concept in Hinduism and Buddhism, but I digress.I didnt get far in the book, to be fair, i simply *couldnt*. The characters seemed one dimensional and sometimes not even that. The writing seems to try so hard to be something but comes off completely lacking depth. I was very disappointed."
1,clippers,"I am very displeased with this product, as a matter of fact I'm in the process of sending it back to you. There was hair in the blade, even after cleaning it I still attempted to use it. It wouldn't cut hair or anything else for that matter even if my life depended on it. I was very disatisfied."
1,I wish it wasn't just us,"Very dull; poor studio sound; I had seen this performer in NYC and actually thought he had potential, but this album is very weak."
2,look at part number it is actually a 3200 NOT a 3800,I thought i was ordering a 3800 and got a 3200. Not amd's fault. amazon sucks. the a to z gurantee thing is a joke too. In my case at least. The vendor was rude too. I think it would be a no brainer to fix this but they STILL have not fixed it.
4,Only had it a month so far,I've had it for a short time but so far it's pretty good. It works just fine. I had to use a dvd cleaner to watch a brand new dvd today for the first time. It's cool to be able to record on a dvd though!
2,Didn't help much,"I bought this upon recommendation of several web sites for long-term low-grade infections. I tried it, but saw no improvement. I was really positive that it would work, after all that I read, so I thought that I would at least get a placebo affect, but I saw no improvement whatsoever in my sypmtoms. I still have a bottle left."
1,No mystery here,"First let me say that I think cat lovers and librarians should be banned from reviewing Miss Zukas books. Show them a cat or a catalog and they lose all objectivity. ""Out of Circulation"" is a hugely flawed book not worth wasting your time on. For one thing, it is supposedly a mystery, but Miss Zukas DOES NOT solve a mystery in this book! She is stuck in a cabin with a bunch of likely suspects, no clues are revealed for her or the reader to chew on, and in the last 20 pages the baddie picks up a gun and declares herself. Nobody solves anything! Other problems: The names of people are ridiculously contrived. A suspect builds a snow cave, apparently in a few minutes in freshly fallen snow. This is an impossibility. I half expected the know-it-all Miss Zukas to say ""Wait a minute, you can't build a snow cave in fresh snow"" but that bit of reality doesn't intrude on the plot. I was shocked when I saw the other reviews of this book as I expected at least some bad ones."
5,Obnoxious main character--but try and put the book down!,"If it's true that there is some of a book's main character in the author, I pity Jo Dereske's family. Helma Zukas is a self-righteous, prim old maid who seems to have a case of arrested social development. And her best friend, Ruth, borders on the unbelievable. On the other hand, it is pretty much impossible not to finish the first book, and then want the others in the series immediately. It's because we see touches of humanity starting to emerge from Helma Zukas...and we want to be there for the final unveiling. Also, some of her ways take many readers back to a time when social conventions were stiffer...but the world was a lot nicer place!"
2,"Very confusing, but nice recipes.","Quite a few recipes, many good, but as a prior reviewer stated, this book is confusing, especially with the hard cheeses. If you have never done this before, try a beginner's book like the one by Shane Sokol. That one has fewer recipes, but is wonderful for the beginner."
2,Not Clear Enough...,"I guess it's really personal preference when it comes down to it, but I'd already started making cheese when I purchased this book and it was confusing, so no wonder a complete beginner had trouble. Most beginner home cheese makers are going to use store bought milk and unless you have read & ingrained in your head the section about adding calcium chloride to store bought milk, you will fail with every recipe because it is not mentioned even as optional in any of the recipes. Also didn't care for 'packet' ingredient listings, a unit of measurement is more appropriate, the packet suggests everyone will be purchasing supplies from this author's store and everything is prepackaged for you.There is a great recipe varity, but i've had to mark up the book so much to include things that are missing it almost isn't worth it."
4,farm,informative book in the kitchen great for the one or two cow or goat familys would reccomend to others thanks
3,Cheese,"The beginning of the book almost made me stop reading, but as I kept going it look much better. Iam gona try out one just to see. Alot of information."
4,Cheese making made simple.,"I rate the book 4 stars because, the book is well written and easy to follow when making many of the cheese products."
4,Excellent,"Very informative have made very good cheeses from this book.Highly recommend, recipes easy to follow with great results, well done Ricki"
4,Everything we were hoping for so far...,"My wife and I were looking for a ""getting started"" type of book for making cheese at home. We tried several others here at Amazon.com and were very disappointed, most likely due to our being ""overly frugal"" on the price.This book however, has proven to be everything we have hoped for, so far. We are only beginning our cheese making adventure but the mozzarella and ricotta recipes have been clear, concise and ... and a 50/50 success rate. Mozzarella was outstanding, ricotta... not so good, but likely our fault.We are only rating it as a 4, because we simply have not explored the book in depth enough to be certain there are no instructional errors in all the recipes and walk through explanations.The histories of the various cheeses make for fun and interesting reading as well.. it is not just a recipe book.Our sincere thanks to Ricki Carroll for this book."
1,Disapointing,Now that I can finally make a decent cheese I'm amazed at how the instructions are confusing and at times missing necessary information. (E.g. how much mold to add to the milk). I feel like my lack of early success due to relying on this book almost put me off from cheesemaking altogether. She never gives a good overall picture of how things should look or feel. (...)
4,I really enjoy this book.,I disagree with the person who wrote that the recipes were confusing and hard to follow. I think it's very easy to follow. I would definitely suggest reading the introduction before jumping right in. But overall I've found the book really useful and it has introduced me to a fun new hobby.A lot of the old world recipes and traditions are being slowly lost in the world of fast food and frozen peanut butter sandwiches. I'm really happy this book exists and I can learn this process. It makes me appreciate the time and effort that goes into things like this. It's very easy to forget where that plastic bag of shredded taco cheese started.
5,Well done,This was a very helpful book for myself. I had only a small knowledge of cheese and cheesemaking but this book helped me to make great cheese on my first try! I have a much more in depth knowledge of cheese making and largely due to this book.
3,Another cheesy cheese book,"I guess this is the bible for cheese makers. I started with this and was pretty disappointed.It is a perfunctory treatment , assuming more knowledge than you have. Cheese making is a process you can monitor step by step. A good site David Fankhauser U of Cincinnati Clermont Prof of Biology and Chemistry goes step by step.He explains what to look for, what ingredients do. What to look for.I would give him 5 stars .This book deserves 2.5"
3,"Not bad, but there's better out there.","After much experience with wine and beermaking, I decided to try making my own cheese. Well, it is defiantely not a trivial matter. We are not making pasta here... This book was not bad, and helped me understand the process of making cheese but the actual recipes were confusing and hard to follow. If you have never made cheese before, try another book. There are better ones out there by Shane Sokol & Barbara Ciletti for beginners. In summary: a nice book if you want some insight into the cheesemaking process, but on the ""how-to"" side, the book is of limited use once you have gone past your first steps."
4,I think is a wonderful book,"I am very disapointed to read a negative comment about this book of Ricki Carroll, because being myself a dairy microbiologist and working everyday with cheeses, as Mrs. Carroll, I really find her book a great reference for anyone who wants to start making cheese from home from the very begining, or even for proffesionals to clarify some general concepts. You will find in this book good and precise explanations about a difficult topic, not always easy to explain, what she masters well. Is an affordable book for anyone interested in making our own cheese."
4,Good Book Poor experience,"The book is wonderfule, A-1 Books was terrible. It took almost a month for it to arrive, definitely will not order here again."
2,"incomplete info, requires author's ingredients","The general info in the beginning is useful, but the recipes are very much lacking. The specifics of a recipe (such as indirect heating of the milk over a period of time) are not mentioned in the recipe, but must be remembered from the intro sections. Also, the book requires the use ingredients sold only by the author's company. For example, their ""fromage blanc"" starter isn't just the starter, but also includes rennet, which isn't mentioned anywhere in the recipe. So, if you haven't purchased the ""cheesemaking.com"" fromage blanc starter, you will be missing a key ingredient and not even know about it.Also, I found the author's website to often contradict her recipes in the book. Following only the book, I've had several failures. Also, there is no helpful information for troubleshooting to figure out where I went wrong."
5,It's All About the Cheese - Delicious and Charming,"Home Cheese Making is an excellent read and resource for anyone who wants to actually make cheese or read about the details and process of making cheese! You will find not only delightful reproducible cheese recipes for the beginner to advanced Cheese Maker, but also recipes that include cheese as a main ingredient. There are first hand ""Cheese Maker's Stories"" that provide details of those who operate their own cheese business. And not the least important - an extensive glossary of terms, troubleshooting guide, resources for supplies, groups of interest, websites with marketing information, and a list of newsletters and other educational materials. This book is a must-have for any Cheese Lover or Foodie's Library!"
5,Excellent guide to making cheese!,I love this book! It's my cheese making bible~ I was really taken back to see that anyone would possibly give this book less than 4 stars (and why the heck not 5??)! Someone posted a negative review that says you have to use the author's ingredients--I'm not sure where they got that idea.... You can get cheese making ingredients like rennet from a lot of different places. I think it's great that she offers a 1-stop shopping place to get all the items you need at reasonable/competitive prices. I highly recommend this book for beginner or advanced cheese maker alike! : )
2,Disappointing time-waster,"This is a very frustrating book. The recipes are vague and often incomplete (e.g. in one recipe for stilton she has you putting the curd in a mold, turning it a few times and then later aging the cheese...but no indication of when it is to be removed from the mold). Quantities are often imprecise or missing. If you use the book in conjunction with her website [...] it's doubly frustrating, since there are tons of discrepancies between the book and the website. In one case I found three differing instructions for the same procedure between the website and the book. Perhaps this is a good book if you are experienced and already know all the ins and outs of cheesemaking but if you are a beginner and need clear step-by-step instructions look elsewhere. Home cheesemaking is time-consuming and requires equipment and supplies so you don't want to be working from a book as carelessly put together as this one."
1,Leaking,"The title says it all - the product is leaking, therefore is not usable. That is it. Short and simple."
3,decent toy for younger children,"Not a great water gun, but a decent one for the younger children. My son is 4 can operate this toy with no problem. That said he was a bit frustrated by the volume of water it shot compared to other water pistols."
1,"did not fit properly,not as pictured","product sent was not the same as pictured, also iam now out of the cost to ship back, and possible 20 percent restocking fee. i dont feel this is right. i myself own 2 auto shops and DO NOT TREAT MY CUSTOMERS THIS WAY..."
2,3 losers 1 winner,"The period of history is fascinating. However, the author was very long winded about describing the period. The author spends to much of the time recounting ancient historians and their views. The author could have made this period come to life a little bit more with energy."
2,could be better,"I purchased this to match my cover for my Ipad 2. What a disappointment!!!!The description stated it is compatable with the Ipad cover, it does fit well, but the color is not even close to the ipad cover. It looks like I bought the case from the Dollar Store rather than what I thought was a great company."
3,required reading,"it was required reading for a sociology class i took. about as interesting as your average textbook, the case studies were the best part."
5,Great!,The book was in great condition and at an affordable price! Good read. Thank you so much!Look forward to putting this text to good use.
2,Alright,"The description said it had a few highlighted areas, that was not the case. The person had pages of personal opinions on the book and it is unable to resell. Not worth mentioning to another sstudent"
2,Where are the page numbers??,"The ebook for my Ipad2 is missing page numbers. It does include location numbers, but when the teacher assigns a group of pages to read, these location numbers are useless. This makes it very difficult to figure out what is due for class. I don't understand why there are no page numbers, as this should be a top priority for school text books. Ebooks are wonderfully portable and terrifically convenient to use. It is a shame this very important feature was left out."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"I was highly satisfied with my order, it was in much better condition than the description led on. Overall I was very happy, and will definitely be making another purchase sometime."
3,For experienced developers...,"This book assumes that you have some development experience with Servlets, JSP's and OO methodolgies. The author explains things clearly and concisely, but was very dissapointed with all the typos - especially with the code snippets. It was very frustrating trying to learn while all the while wondering where the errata was. You can download an errata sheet, but the sheet still misses many errors. I agree with a previous review that not having complete source code listed in the book is a problem. As you are working with the examples - you need to spend time comparing what's in the book with the source code (which you must download). Again, this is a distraction and I found myself breaking away from concentrating on the tasks to jump around here and there to verify code. This could easily have been a much better book by simply including the code (perhaps in the appendix) and by minimizing the typos."
2,"Could be a ""must have"", but...","I wish the author spent more time on the quality of the book and its contents, as opposed to just getting it out the door for JavaOne. I found it really annoying when I downloaded the errata of the book, it needed an errata itself too....Even if you only want to learn the reference implementation (which is what most of the book is all about), you'll have to compile/deploy the examples by trial-and-error. Correction for most of the technical errors have not made it to the errata either."
2,Don't rely on this book -too many mistakes,"I've used this book for several months now - and there are just too many mistakes in the text. Mistakes that will lead a J2EE component developer to make design/coding mistakes that will take a lot of hard work to figure out.For example: page 217: Introduction to Entity Beans""Rules for Implementing ejbFinder methods"" ...""The method must not throw the java.rmi.RemoteException""Note: the NOT - wrong - it must declare that it throws RemoteException!This is just one of many examples - and if you check the errata on the web site - it doesn't contain very many of the mistakes (not this one) so one is left with very poor misleading information.Do technical books not get edited by technical editors? Demand better books - vote with you money - buy a different book! Or buy mine use - I'll sell it cheep!"
1,A terrible book,"This book is probably one of the worst EJB book one can buy. It's short on theory and long on practical using Sun's J2EE. There are a lots of books better than this one. Eg ""Professional EJB"", ""Mastering Enterprise JavaBeans"". Both of the above books is very good on theory. For more practical book ""Sam Teach YourSelf EJB IN 21 Days"" is much better than this book.? Why because it uses weblogic 7 for the practical. Even though it is also short on theory but at least it's exercises are usefull in the sense you learn how to use it in Weblogic 7.0. Lastly, I am writing these negative comments about this book because the more pages I read from this book, the more I felt I got cheated."
4,healing,"it is helping me draw on other healing energies to help cure parkinsons disease! so I recommend this book for assistance in bringing the energy of life spirit closer, for mind, body n soul."
5,Excellent entrance into the MAP system,I also have the accompanying DVDs but I also use my book as a reference and can be highlighted. Both are useful.
3,Like the procedure,I enjoy doing the process (though I haven't gotten back to doing it regularly) but I find the writing a bit tiring to read
3,Here's the process... in a nutshell,"This process is a simple one... you call upon spirit beings and ask them to heal you. You lie there and picture yourself being 'scanned' and healed. It's a very passive exercise.This, in some ways, is like SUBUD.The only reason you need to get the book is to learn the specific names of the spirit beings you need to call upon and the dosages of flower essences to use. Everything else you could figure out on your own, if you have a good imagination."
1,Trust yourself,"Trust yourself. This book, MAP, and the process will change your life. It's true, be prepared. To be fair, they do to you what they think is in your highest and best good, it may or may not be. Have a strong relationship with the Archangels first before venturing forward and a strong sense of self. Set boundaries. There methods are not always tactful or comfortable and I have seen them really screw people up. It is not their intention, but it is what can happen."
3,Surrender to the Process,"It has been a long time since I read this book, cover to cover.I recall the emphasis on the flower essences to help speed up the healing, but that always seemed 1) expensive, 2) confusing, and 3) not resonant with the path I wanted to take.So, since then, I have memorized the coning process and I have learnt what my MAP team is called, and I open conings all the time. But I realize, now that I have come across Esther Hicks and the Abraham Teachings, that in opening a coning, I have actually surrendered to the process, released the ""oars"" and am relaxing. Creating relief for myself is truly the key to wellness, and I think that was the initial intention of this MAP work.So, to credit this book, I would say that coning is a good way to initiate the process of releasing thoughts and then wellness can occur."
3,There are better methods of healing,"One of my Reiki students gifted this book to me believing I would find it interesting.This method of healing works but there are better ways IMHO.I didn't care for this book for the following reasons.1. Too ritualistica. open a coning of power.b. invokation of the healing deva.c. invokation of Pan.d. invokation of the MAP team.e. closing down the coning of power.2. Needs other things like the Perelandra essences which are expensive.I am a Master/Teacher of three forms of Reiki (Karuna, Tibetan, and Usui Shiki Ryoho), and a 7th facet Seichim master. I would prefer to simply place my hands where the healing is necessary and turn on the energy. Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda"
4,"Food, Family, Community & Whiskey","I am so excited for the opportunity to review Jack Daniel's Spirit of Tennessee Cookbook Vol 1. I am not only excited because I love cookbooks, food and Jack but because I lived in a small town right beside Lynchburg, TN which is home to the Jack Daniel's Distillery. Jack Daniel's is not just about whiskey. It's about food, family and community. This is truly an American iconic brand.After flipping through the many recipes what really stuck out was the pictures of the people and places that the authors chose to spotlight. There is so much rich history in middle Tennessee and Jack Daniels has been a huge part of this history. This book sets out to capture the ""spirit"" of this relationship and delivers very nicely. If you or anybody you know has ties to Middle Tennessee, Jack Daniels or loves good home cooking, then this is the book for them.Two recipes to note:Cafe Daniel (page 13)Jack Daniel's Chocolate Velvet Cake (page 156)"
4,Southern recipes with a kick!,"Who knew you could make such great recipes with Whiskey? I am not a heavy drinker, but now that I know I can use this whiskey for cooking great dishes, people might start seeing me in the alcohol department more at the store. There are some amazing, mouth-watering recipes in this book that I can't wait to try. Here are just a few of the recipes you will find in this cookbook:Hot Toddy (which my mom made when I was little and sick.)Whiskey Nut BreadFlaming Tennessee TenderloinBlack Jack CakeYou get the idea! Yummy sounding recipes with a little kick in them! Go ahead and give them a try! Even if you don't like the recipe, you always have the whiskey for afterwards!"
1,What?,"I tell ya, I dont remember buying this. So Im not sure why theyre asking me to review it. But it looks like a low budget card."
4,Not bad,"Had to change the batteries after the watch came, otherwise it's fine, especialyl for the price"
3,Dragged Away,"I was impressed with Alex's song ""Be Water"" that appeared on theSongs for Laura, Vol 1collection, which led me to this earlier CD of his. Acoustic guitar strums a pulsing beat with Alex's pleasing haunting vocals on the title track. Goldfarb gets a bit morbid on ""Ready for the Ride,"" a song about facing death, ""And when the lights go down, the scenery is dragged away; The actor does take his bow; The show is now over."" ""Grace"" closes the set with a lovely ballad. This set is soft & slow, mostly Alex and his guitar. My personal preference is to have about two-thirds uptempo songs and one-third slower songs. There are no uptempo songs here, no band. If you love the soft folk sound of Nick Drake, you may well enjoy this as Alex has a lovely voice and writes melodious songs. For me, they tend to blend and nothing particularly stands out. This set is neither bad nor memorable. Enjoy."
5,mason lids,"Very nice product I love the plaid and they dress up the pantry. I also have blue check, they help me withwhat canned good is which without worry."
5,THESE CRASH DIETS are so efective!,"when you need to get rid of a few pounds in order o wear ""that dress "" to ""that party ""It's so fast, you loose so much weight, so eficient, that you will think about going on with hese diets until you recapture your ideal weight !Be sure you'll wear ""that dress "" if you follow ""these diets "" for a few days"
4,"Tool does the job, but build quality suffers","It's a great idea for a puller and deserves 5-stars for innovation and practicality. It lost a star because it looks like it was built by a bunch of blind kindergartners. The quality of the steel is questionable and the molding of the plastic handle is about what I'd expect from Harbor Freight's $0.49 tool bin. Keep it oiled if you don't want it to rust. That said, it does the job and since nothing else like it exists, you may as well buy it if you're changing seals."
1,does not work - garbage,"this tool is completely useless for Subaru cam seals.just slips off, scratches cam and busts your knucklestotal waste of time and money"
1,Too flimsy,"The first time I tried to use this seal puller the shaft bent way too easily. I tried it on a smaller seal and it still didn't work. Went back to a screwdriver and the seals came out easily so they weren't in that tight. Save your money,"
3,"Seems like a decent quality product, but didn't work for my crank seals",I bought in prep for a timing belt job thinking it would make removal of my cam/crank seals easier. It didn't help remove the crank seals - it just scratch up the areas a bit and I ended up having to use an alternative method.Can't say it wouldn't work on other shaft type seals but didn't work for me. That's why I'm giving a 3 - seems quality and seems like it could have a purpose but just wasn't useful for me.
1,broke after 3 times use,"just came back from a trip and it broke after the 3 third time of use. this is awful, don't buy"
4,Handy little accessory for travel,"When traveling with two heavy bags, this device makes the second one a piggyback to the first. Very handy and strong."
2,Lasted for exactly 1/2 of a trip,Not a good strap if you were hoping to hoof a lap top bag to a roll on. It would be fine for ligher loads but not up to the drill for a raod warrior.
2,Not great,I lost the one that came with my bag. It was perfect. This one is too short and therefore puts too much stress on the handle of my suitcase
2,I'm glad i bought back up straps,"If you're trying to connect two 50 lb suitcases together, this is not the strap to use. Look for the Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker, Black, One Size.This simple buckle and strap looks easy to use but it isn't. When you're in a hurry and you need to adjust the tension on this strap, you're fussing around with it in baggage claim. The Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker has extra ""tongue"" to quickly pull on (like a backpack strap) so you can clip, pull to tighten, and GO.This Lewis N Clark strap is good for light loads and smaller bags. For larger ones, this one was a pain to use. You get what you pay for. Choke up the extra $5 and get the Travelon, you'll be glad you did."
4,not for the younger toddler,"I started really urine training my daughter at 17 months (and had her doing BM on the toilet at a year). While this book had tons of information for the later trainer, there was not much at all for the younger child, other than the typical list of ""readiness signs"". I still give it four stars because if my daughter were maybe 3 or 4 years old, this book would be invaluable. There is lots of information on how to motivate an older child, how to deal with particular problems and temporary setbacks, etc. It does not give one definite ""way"" to train, but rather suggests many possible routes along the way and emphasizes that each child is different and will be more or less successful depending on the route. If you're starting at an earlier age, I'd look somewhere else. My child has all the readiness signs, but is not old enough to be motivated by ""pretty panties"" or ""friends at preschool"", nor is old enough to give me major temper tantrums or refusal to go."
3,A basic book for training older children,This book might be most helpful if you have a 3 or 4 year old and you are just starting the process as it states that is the age when children are logical and goal oriented. It's not really a step-by-step guide as the back cover states.
5,"Simpe, yet effective","This is great book for first time moms, especially...don't get frustrated just follow the steps and don't give up. It works!! Good gift for a baby shower."
4,"Deep reading, very informative.","This book is deep, but after I made it through the first couple of chapters, it really began to flow for me. More than just refuting the Jesus Seminar's findings, it helped me with some basic questions I have had as a Christian (e.g., questions about the origin of the Bible and the church). I need much more for an answer than ""Just because that's the way it's always been."" This book offers those answers"
5,A lot of excellent points,"This book has a lot of excellent points about various aspects the Jesus Seminar attacks. It's just enough info to wet your appetite and give you something to say in casual conversation to address these issues, but not enough for a thorough defense of any of them. But a very good overall view."
2,Preaching to the choir,"This is a good book to ""restore one's faith"" i.e. for those who desparately want to hold on the the truth of Christian doctrines fabricated by the Church in aid of Empire. That is the faith of orthodox Christian belief drummed into the heads of ""believers"" for centuries through institutional power.A spiritual practise that requires belief in historic events that happened two thousand years rests on a very weak basis. Historical reconstruction is prone to error ... and much of the received documentation prone to manipulation. No one really knows what happened two thousand years ago .. but if you are desparately wishing to believe it is true no doubt you will be able to find enough ""facts"" to lull you back to sleep."
4,Coffee drinkers,"First off, for the price of the product it is great. You have to experiement with it a bit to find the right brew for you. There is a dial on the top of the coffee maker, once you find the right setting, the coffee is good. But if you are a coffee dependant in the mornings before work, I'd suggest first trying it out a few time on a weekend to ensure that on Monday morning you get that great cup o' Joe to start off your day/week right. After a test period, the machine performs at a high level. Good luck..."
3,Watch the brew basket!,"The only reason this gets such a low rating has to do with the design of the brew basket. The brew basket does not lock properly in place. You must hold it in place as you remove the carafe - or it will swing out! Sure defeats the ""pause & serve"" feature! My work around has been to use the carafe from my previous coffee maker. It is the same height, but does not have such a deep impression in the lid. Therefore, it does not pull the brew basket out as you try to get a cup of coffee. I have 'pause & serve', safety, and a not so new carafe."
2,"Messy, hard to clean, inadequate directions","I've had this machine a couple of months. It makes perfectly adequate coffee, but I have yet to remove the carafe from its stand or to pour a cup of coffee without making a mess (I never had these problems with my former coffee maker, a Mr. Coffee brand.) You can't clean the coffee pot in the dishwasher, because the lid won't come off (my Mr. Coffee lid was removable.) Finally, the brew-strength selector is impossible to interpret, and its use is not addressed in the manual."
1,Junk,"I Purchased my first proctor silex coffee maker more than 25 years ago and several since then. have always great service from these Proctor Silex machines,Till I recently purchased this new model.What a piece of cheaply made junk.The Glass Pot pours everywhere but in you cup,if you dont be sure and close the lid down tight the coffee will fill up the brew pot and run over causing a fire hazzard, the automatic shut off that stops the flow if you wish a cup before brewing is completed still drips onto the heating surface.I could go on and on but you get the idea,seems this company has gone the route of so many others,produce and sell cheap inferior merchandise, made make a profit and forget quality cause it cuts into profit.MINE WENT INTO THE TRASH!If you want junk purchase this item you wont be disappointed."
4,Good Coffee,"The proctor-silex easy morning 12-cup coffeemaker makes great-tasting coffee. Even if I want to brew only 1 cup, I use this machine. The glass caraf needs gentle treatment or it will break. I give it 4 stars because it does not have a pre-set timer."
3,Great price,"I don't expect much from coffee makers anymore, they all seem to die within a couple of years. I ordered this because it was inexpensive, and it works fine. The pot does not sit very well on the unit, and we have to swing open the filter basket in order to serve-- that's not a showstopper though."
1,Just No,"I loved the size of the bottle since it fits nicely in my purse. However, I don't think it works very well. I had high expectations for this product since most reviews I read online are good. In my opinion it's nothing great I have many lotions that moisturize much better than this did. The WORST part of this product would be the smell! It has a very nasty aroma to it. It is the worst smelling lotion I have EVER tried. I wouldn't waste any money on this again. I'm extremely disappointed in this."
1,NOT A GOOD PRODUCT,"I purchase a brand new Booster from Amazon, the thing work good for 2 weeks then it went dead, It completely kill my signal, but all the led and pwer remain working, even the little humming it gives off. Now i have wasted so much muoney on a product like this. I should have read the reviews."
1,Save your money,"I was trying to extend my network and make it more reliable in its coverage and this signal booster seemed just the thing. It only has 2 major flaws which make it totally undesirable.First, IF you are able to increase the signal from your wireless access point, your computer's signal will not be increased at the same time. What does this mean? You can see the wireless network, but it cannot see you. In other words, the logic behind this device is flawed.Second, I tried installing the signal booster anyway, and it brought absolutely NO increase in signal strength -- no matter how high I mounted it. I recommend looking for a hi-gain antenna instead."
1,Does not work,"This does not seem to work at all. It actually made the signal worse. The instructions also say it should be plugged into your wireless device. That makes no sense. You can't plug an antenna into an ipad, or even a laptop."
1,Worst ever service!!,This is the first product I have purchased from Amazon that has been any issue but non the less it is a total screw job. The antenna on my modems do not screw off. I called for support and they gave me a guy in India named Shawn who was dumber than dirt and twice and arrogant. He could not tell me which modems this product would work with. Only suggested I but theirs. I looked theirs up and it supports WEP security and not WAP. I call back and in all of India I get the same jerk. He now tells me there is a list but I must email for it. I had to ask him to email it to me and he said he couldn't. Yet I have to slowly give him my email address at the start of the call. But he says he can not use it. It has been 3 days since I emailed Hawking and no replies. These guys must build a good product but they are out to lunch with support. I hear there is an adapter cable but Raj...ohhh I am sorry...Shawn could not tell me that either.Good luck with this product.
2,It's alright....,"Boosted signal enough for my application, but not as much as the product advertisement claimed. Signal still reading very low to low in other other rooms in house."
4,Sometimes works,"The device initially worked fairly well, but after a few days, the signal booster no longer worked. I had to reset it a few times so far."
3,Pretty Okay,"I really wouldn't recommend this product. First, it's expensive for what it is. It has helped my signal some, but I think there are probably better methods of achieving it. I really wanted it to be super, but it wasn't.Second, that high pitched noise is no joke. Those who dismiss it are probably older in years and can't hear high pitched noises (your ability to hear high pitched noises diminishes as you age). If you're under 30, beware. Anyway, the high pitched noise is noticeable and grating. It doesn't go away on the lower settings.That said, my signal has improved, so it does at least work. I just haven't noticed the type of improvement mentioned by the Microsoft certified guy. I certainly don't get signal across the street."
5,I am swimming in internet signals!,"This little device did exactly what it said it would do, and then some! I had been having difficulties with my Comcast Netgear wireless router, which was only strong enough to cover about half of the house, and none of the yard areas. I bought the Hawking, unscrewed the antenna from my Netgear, and plugged the Hawking in. Immediately (and the default position was maximum power) I had signal in every part of my house and every part of my yard. Even some of the neighbors up the street want to know who this ""new"" signal source is in the neighborhood. Anyway, this product was easy to install (it took less than a minute) and has done everything it promised. My ""weak signal"" issues are a thing of the past."
1,Didn't help at all,"I have seven wireless devices (2 Apple TVs, iPad, ipod, iphone, PC and a Mac) and all of them got a LOWER signal when I hooked this up. I tried moving it in a several locations...was very unhappy."
1,Actually made my wifi signal worse,"I am averizon Fios customer. I read the most ""helpful"" review bout this product and decided to give it a try. I Added it to my wireless router and the wifi signal actually worsened significantly across my house."
1,"Not Compatible with Linksys Routers, Doesn't Work Anyway","Out of the box, this product is NOT compatible with Linksys/Cisco routers. If you purchase an additional $30 (really) worth of cables you can hook it up to a Linksys but, at least for me, even when I got it hooked up, it still did absolutely nothing for my signal. It didn't make it one iota stronger--where it worked before, it still worked, and where it didn't before, it still didn't. I'm relatively tech savvy, I know I had it hooked up correctly (set-up was quite simple), and the Hawking showed green lights (i.e. working) but on none of its three settings did I experience ANY signal increase, anywhere in my home."
3,Slows down your connection,"This product has great tech support and they were very nice. However, increasing the range will slow down your connection. I didn't realize that when I purchased this."
1,Simply did not work.,"I have Fios and I did exactly what the instructions indicated - this device did not enhance the wireless strenght at all. Called Hawking Tech support. Was advised to change the signal to the my wireless Actiontec router. Got Verizon on the phone and their Tech person changed to recommended signal channel 11, then 1, then 6. 6 gave me a ""fair"" signal strenght. I removed this booster and replaced it with pre-existing antenna and recieved the same ""fair"" signal strenght. That signal test was 40 feet from the the router. Since $70 is a bit pricey for a paper weight, I promptly returned it to Amazon."
4,"Great product, almost perfect","As described by many, I immediately saw results, in a two bedroom townhouse, we were not getting good signals on the second floor. This product solved the problem without having to install software, get help or re-configure anything. We now get strong signal everywhere in the town home. Two things that don't make this experience perfect. 1) When I received the product, had to obtain an adapter that will work with our Lynksis router, I feel this should have come already with the product. 2) some described a pitchy noise. I obtained the same and when I realized that the product was close to computer speakers and adjusted, the noise went away. Great overall experience. Have had the product for 4 months now and we are enjoying the improved signal."
4,Works as advertised,"This does what is is supposed to do. Having another piece of technology on top of my router is a little much, but it boosts the signal to places in my house where I had an unreliable signal."
2,Good... BUT... please read,"This device actually worked but we live in a pretty quiet neighborhood in Long Beach, CA. We got more coverage and WiFi connected in places we didn't before around the house. We just barely got some WiFi in the backyard too, thanks to this Hawking signal booster.Here's the BAD: it creates this really high pitched frequency that is very very audible. If you have it set up somewhere where you hang out in the house, it may drive you nuts. My wife and I couldn't deal with it and we're returning it.Ending up spending $20 more for the Amped Wireless High Power Wi-Fi Signal Booster (SB1000) instead, which is also available here on Amazon. It was definitely worth the $20 more. This Amped SB1000 boosted the signal even more and makes NO SOUND."
2,Dissapointed,Pro - Easy install.Pro - Increased the number of bars from 3 to 3/4.Con - According to speedtest - my download speeds decreased after install. Prior to install > 10Mps. After install 5-7 Mps. I repeated the experiment several times.Odd. Anyway - I guess I am now stuck trying to sell this thing.
4,Works Great but hard to mount,"I have owned this product for a couple of years and I am very stisfied with its performance. I purchased it because my Linksys security camera would not connect to my network from its location in the garage. Once I Installed the unit I had no more problems. I have one problem with Hawkins support. I could not mount on my wall as noted in the directions. The mounting screws that came with the unit would not fit into the mounting slots. I contacted Hawkins about the problem and they told me to go to a local hardware store and find some screws that would fit (what great support???)!! I was told by the Hawkins representative that although the mounting screws and instructions were included in the package, they were not a part of guaranteed support???"
3,Works well with FIOS but began to die after 6 months,"Tried Hawking HWREN1 Hi-Gain Wireless-300N Range Extender, would not work with FIOS and Actiontek router despite a half hour on the phone with Hawking tech support, returned unit to Amazon, bought Hawking HiGain Signal Booster version 2 - HSB2, works well with FIOS, signal 2 (low) to three bars (good) before, now 4 (very good) to 5 bars (excellent) on unit's maximum boost level. Unit makes no noise, nor does it become warm to touch. I am using a high gain antenna, rather than the antenna that came with unit. After 6 months constant use signal from unit began to weaken, had to buy a new unit."
1,HSB2 booster,this product did not work at all. I got a worse wifi signal than without it. I emailed customer service for support and didn't even get a reply. Really nice! Don't bother buying this junk.
1,did not work for me,"This signal booster did not work for me. I set it up according to the instructions, connected to a Dlink Router DI-624.When I attempted to connect to the router via laptop, it would connect and then drop the connection after about 10 seconds. That would repeat indefinitely.I tracked the signal with a strength meter, and it boosted it to the level expected, but for some reason when the connection was made to the router, it was dropped.I sent the first unit into Hawking thinking it was defective, but they replaced the unit, and it did exactly the same thing.I have no idea why it didn't work. Maybe my fault.I am thinking perhaps I need two of these, one at the router, and one at the laptop. Perhaps the signal going back to the router is not strong enough to keep the connection."
3,Recreational Vehicle use?,We are travelers and need a booster to place into our trailer to enable us to pick up a outside wifi signal for our laptop...would this particular booster work for us?
4,Gives FIOS a boost,After reading the reviews I decided to take a gamble and attempt to boost the lousy FIOS Actiontech router signal. The Hawking Signal Booster worked with my router and all my computers after about an hour of fiddling. I've had it almost a week and I'm getting a strong and steady signal in areas of the house where I could never even get a faint signal using only the FIOS router. It does emit a tone that makes some people cringe BUT only if they are within 5' of it. To avoid causing auditory anguish I moved it to an area where only the dog might be bothered by it. Since he's not supposed to be there anyway maybe this Booster will serve a twofold purpose.
1,Do not give business to this company!,"Not only did the device not function as stated (the signal was not increased or extended), upon advising the company of this the level of customer service received was horrible.They forced me to mail the product back at my own expense, then lost it upon receipt. After numerous attempts at follow up to provide tracking and get a replacement product sent back - they simply stopped responding.At this point, it has been three months since I initiated contact and I am now out close to $100 between the cost of product and shipping expense.The products are inferior and the level of service is atrocious. I strongly recommend you stay away."
5,"Simple, and it works!","I have to agree with the other reviewers who gave this product 4 or 5 stars. I have the same situation with some of the reviewers that have the Actiontec router from VerizonFios and getting weak signals depending on the location of the router and all of my family's computers/laptops (especially with my own computer losing WiFi connection at times). After connecting the device (which was so simple to do), all of my family's computers/laptops instantly had excellent signal strength connections and I had no ""drop-outs"". I had consistent access. Well worth the price."
4,It works!,"I was getting 1 to 2 bars on my ipad and iphone in one corner of my house on the 2nd floor, after hooking it up to my Verizon FIOS ActionTec router on the first floor, I get 3 to 4 bars consistently. I'm happy with this hassle-free product."
2,No difference for us,"Our house has lots of solid rock walls and this booster hasn't made any difference in our signal strength. Maybe in normal homes with sheetrock walls it will help, but not in ours. Kind of disappointed since our internet provider replaced our router. Can't get internet throughout the house anymore. Hate standing in my kitchen in order to surf the web."
1,Hawking HSB2 Didn't Perform,"I have the Verizon fios Actiontec router which has poor wireless range in my 1600 sq ft home. I bought the HSB2, hoping to extend the range. The instructions showed only connecting it to a wireless PCI card antenna jack. But I connected it to my Actiontec router antenna jack, hoping to boost its wireless range. After installing it, I saw no increase in range or performance. Instead, I was unable to connect to my internet service. I tried re-installing it and rebooting the router, but no change. So back in the box, it went. I may one day connect it to my PCI wireless card when I get a longer RP-SMA male to male extension cable. The included RP-SMA extension cable is very short."
1,"Two boosters, both shipments died quickly","The first time I ordered this, it boosted the signal reasonably well but died. As in the entire unit stopped working. I replaced it from Amazon, and just over the 100% return period, that unit died as well. We're now adding Cat1 wire to our home. So I've had two different copies of this device fail within 3 months. I would not recommend it under any circumstance---save your $85."
4,Pretty good book,"I liked this book, but was disappointed that it was the first in a series, and doesn't stand on it's own very well. It leads up to events that will happen in future books, but don't conclude in this one. Other than that, the author is very good at character development, and has done an excellent job. I would recommend this book, but keep in mind that the sequel doesn't come out until October 2006."
5,A FIND,"I loved, loved, loved, loved, loved this book. Did I say it enough. I found it by accident and couldn't believe how good it was. This book was so, so funny and exciting. I can't wait until the next one. The website leventhumps.com is really well done. Long live Leven."
5,Oh my gosh!,This was such a great book!!! My entire class read it and wanted to know if there was a second one! If there is i can't wait to read it! I give it two thumbs up and five stars!
5,Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo,Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo is an amazing book. I have it and have givin it many people as gifts. A must read!!!
4,Enjoyable read,"I enjoyed reading this book. It had lovable characters, good plot and an easy read. I got a little irritated at Leven at first for always giving up. I understand it was because of the shadows but enough was enough. I also felt so sorry for the toothpick when it was getting ""beat up"" in the diner. Over all it was a good book and look forward to reading the next one."
2,Needs better editing -- mediocre kids book with no appeal to older readers,"Leven Thumps contains some good, creative ideas and an approach to the story that could have worked much, much better. It is poorly executed and in need of not just serious editing but serious revision. This reads like a first draft that has been checked by the grammar sheriff only. There is a lot of ""tell"" that should have been creatively revised into ""show"" in a revision process that apparently didn't happen. One of the effects of that is that the characters, particularly the main one, Leven, are weakly developed and fail to generate any sympathy from the reader. I appreciate the realism of a mean childhood, but it seemed as if the mean minor characters were far more developed than the main character. This could be a good book with a serious reworking."
5,So much fun,"All I can say is thank you Dad. My dad bought this book for me and I loved it. It was so much fun to read. I can't wait for book two.I loved Clover and how he interacted with Leven and Winter and Geth. I think the journey across the world had a lot of interesting twists. I still think about how Geth destroyed Leven's house. What a cool idea.I'm not a big fan of Sabine and the shadows. I have to admit he creeped me out a bit, but the way he was dealt with made me laugh.I hope there's a lot more books in this series. I just had such a good time reading it. Long live Leven."
5,I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great book, I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes brilliant adventure stories like this one!I have only got a small chunk to go, and I really want a scolyphant with some of those funny sweets that move your bodyparts in random places.My friends would be horrified if they tried one.I just cant wait when the next book comes out,(April foo's day!)do you get the joke?"
4,"Fun, especially for younger readers","This is a story in the same genre as Harry Potter, but it should be an easier read for young readers -- and isn't encouraging children to read one of the purposes of children's books? It doesn't break any new ground -- but neither was Rowling the first to write about magical children, nor the first to feature a young protagonist with a lousy home life. Rather, much like all fairy tales are similar to each other, and yet each has a charm of it's own, the same is true of Leven Thumps. The antics of the various characters had me laughing out loud in several parts -- particularly the trials of Geth. The humor has a certain slap-stick feel that young children tend to appreciate over a more cerebral approach.It doesn't have the intensity of Harry Potter, nor the breadth of language, but it *is* something different for your child to read, particularly if HP is still a little out of reach."
5,Wonderful Series,"As an educator and mother, I think that this series is really interesting and quite good. I shop and buy these books for myself to read. I tell my children about them and then they ask for them to read. When they are done, we can chat about them as a family. They are very cleverly written.At first I wasn't that sure I was going to like them as Harry Potter is not an easy act to follow. But, Leven Thumps is endearing. He is an unsuspecting hero. Which I like. Clover is just funny and sooo sweet. He gives Leven things and never tells him exactly what it is for. Leven always is surprised. Just very endearing story lines and characters. Give it a try. You may like it too!!"
5,Amazing book for preteen who loves fantasy books,"My 10 year old son had never heard of this series, but upon reading it, he couldn't put it down. It is now one of his favorites!"
5,In my top 5 favorite books,This book has to be one of my favorites. Such spontanious and mysterious happenings through out the whole book it made me never want to put it down! I would say this book is totally awesome and any age can and should read it
1,Can you get past page 60?,"I, too, got bored after the first few chapters, the characters got into more trouble and did not seem to learn anything. As I read it was OK when will this all end. I did finish and wanted a little more so started the next book to find the same story lines, problems after problems."
4,"good, but not great...","Since there are already so many excellent plot summaries here, I won't offer one up myself.I really liked the offbeat charm of the minor characters, but I felt the protagonist was somewhat underdeveloped. What made Leven a decent person when all he'd known his whole life was scorn and ridicule? There was no explanation offered. The villian is interesting, but also lacking. Overall, this is a good read with many interesting and humorous bits, but Leven is no Matilda or Harry Potter. I'd advise fantasy fans to give it a try just for the indomitable talking toothpick, or the hilarious car chase scene!"
1,Tedius and Unimaginative,"What others have called a complicated plot, I would call a tedius one. I was extremely disappointed in this book. It seems like a good three quarters of the book finds the children wandering around the town. Leven is an almost identical type of Harry Potter with no scar but a white patch of hair, an almost house-elf on his shoulder, magical side-kicks, whomping willow, mean gardians, orphan, fighting against evil dark lord and his dementor like hinch men. The writing was overdone, overly descriptive, and weak. I felt that my time and money had been wasted on this book."
5,My 10 year old loves this series,It's a fun read for her. She is a really great reader so she'll devour pretty much anything but she just loves this series. Great books.
5,215th review so I'll offer some trivia,"Well, I'll tell you a few things that maybe have not been touched on.[...]The ""Mr. Shankly"" in ""Frankly, Mr. Shankly"" has to be referring to the famous Liverpool soccer (football in Britglish) club manager Bill Shankly who is most known for his quote: ""Some people believe football is a matter of life and death, I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.""Given the Smiths were Manchester United supporters, the song could be a dig at their main rivals, Liverpool, even though it is a bit obtuse.As far as the album, no point in me adding any more raves than you've read here before other than I'll say it's their most complete album from start to finish."
4,MorrisSey,"is quite the crooner.The song ""Never Had No One Ever"" reminds me of ""When you laugh about people who feel so very lonely thier only desire is to die.You should know it doesn't make me smile.I wish I could laugh..But that joke isn't funny anymore..It's too close to home and it's too near the bone more than you'll ever know..I've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine.."" from ""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore"" off of (Meat Is Murder.) The joyous ""The Boy With The Thorn In His Side"" is on here.Morrissey's lyrics about women demote the album a star such as ""I've lost my faith in womanhood"" from ""Pretty Girls Make Graves."" (The Smiths.) On this album the offender is ""Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others""..Buy it it's The Smiths."
5,Best smith's ever,I can't believe the value! I lost this CD years ago and was very happy to replace it for less than $5. It's been all that I've played for the last 3 days.
4,i want to go down in musical history,"TQD is indeed pop masterpiece whose genius could have only been penned by moz and co. TQD is also musical statement as well as testament to the world of who the smiths really were- a tour de force of songwriting and rock n roll. The Smiths breeze through various tempos and styles as if it were all too easy for them. begniinng with the snarl of the queen is dead to rockabilly of vicar in a tutu to acoustic boy with the thorn in his side. these are all staples in the smiths canon, which is formidable in itself.I am not a smiths fanatic as i would never buy tickets to see them or morissey by myself. however, i do appreciate them as i would led zeppelin or lynard skynard- a great rocknroll band that carved out it's very own special niche."
5,classic,"This is my favorite Smiths album. Morrissey is truly one of a kind, with the Smiths or solo."
5,Sublime,"""And in a darkened underpass I thought, 'Oh, god my chance has come at last' but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask.""There was a time (between 1986-1991) when I listened to this album at least once if not a dozen times a day. I don't think I could have gotten through college without it. It expressed completely the agnst and melancholia that I felt. I could have locked myself in a dark room and listened to it forever.This is definitely that album that made the Smiths one of the greatest ever."
5,Deserves more than 5 stars,"Absolute brilliance. ""The Queen is Dead"" is my favorite Smiths album; it's impossible to find a flaw anywhere. A recording that effortlessy trounces 99 percent of anything released today.A masterful work of brooding pop that is uplifting. It is the recording that sums up the ""original"" alternative scene; a time when overlooked music like this was appreciated by a select few.It's a CD that demands to be played in its entirety each and every time. If I had to pick a favorite, it would be ""Cemetry Gates"".One of the greatest albums of not only the 80s, but of all time."
4,"Undeniably tight, if a little overly-cited","Never was too crazy for this, but it's hard to deny a consistency and proficiency of craft on the rock solid release. Despite the rigidly detached vibe throughout, each song excels at showcasing why The Smiths are widely regarded as Britain's definitive 80's indie band, laying out blueprints for massive future ripoffs, the likes bands such as Joy Division and only a few others exclusively enjoy in ultimate bragging derivative rites."
4,The Smiths at their funniest!,"Excellent stuff!! From the frantic opening track to the epitath of ""There is a light...."" the Morrisey/Marr combination certainly stretch the band and take their songwriting abilities into a new dimension. The songs are funny, sad, quirky and religious with sweet melodies which means you will play this CD again and again. Also, like many great albums, the messages change as you get older as do your favourite tracks. Worth buying just for the brilliant ""There is a light that never goes out"" and ""Some Girls are bigger than others"". If you are looking for a debut Smiths album then this is the one for you. Rock on Johnny..."
5,Solid Smiths,"One of their best albums. It has many moods. Not all are morose as most label the Smiths' music - Frankly Mr. Shankly, Vicor in a Tutu and Some Girls are Bigger Than Others are examples of how Morrissey like to have fun with lyrics. I bought the cassette in high school when it came out and still listen to it today. I love it."
5,THE BEST SMITHS ALBUM EVER!,"I could write an essay on The Smiths, but this is the FOURTH CD that has, ""mysteriously"" disappeared from my CD collection. Enough said! :o)"
3,"GREAT POP ALBUm, BUT COME On...!","THis is a very good pop album, but come one, folks! It's not the ""icon"" of music some people say! There are good pop songs, with good lyrics, but it is just another mid-eighties British rock band after all."
2,"""The Queen Is Dead"" is Especially Dark","Just reading the lyrics in the CD booklet is enough to send one into the depths of despair. Mr. Morrissey seems a talented poet and often makes allusions to poets that are truly great, but his songs indicate a level of depression that would make Sylvia Plath seem like a happy clown. His collaborator, Mr. Marr, is the more talented partner. His music is light and infective, unlike Morrissey's sad, sad songs and banshee wail. This reviewer especially enjoyed the music to ""Frankly Mr. Shankley"" (also Morrissey's best outing)and ""The Boy with the Thorn in his Side."" The bottom line is that ""The Queen Is Dead"" has excellent music, but depressives, alcoholics and impressionable children and adults should not buy this album."
2,ZZZzZZZzzzZZzzZZZzZZZz,"The Smiths are going through some weird mini-revival now that all the emo kids and trust fund college students are trying to impress their friends with their taste in the ""classics,"" but guess what? This album is still as mind-numbingly boring today as it was when it was first released. This sounds like U2 trying to sound like Joy Division. Only nowhere hear as good as Joy Division and only slightly better than U2. Somebody needs to slap Morrissey and tell him that smug cleverness is not the same thing as attitude and that putting psuedo-gothic song titles on bland pop songs don't make you deep. I really can't stand this stuff...."
1,WHO ARE THE SMITHS????????,"Someone gave me this album said ""It will change your life""It did I needed months of rehab to get over the awlfullness of this album, that singer can't remember his name, he can't sing, give me Bon Jovi any day.Also where are the meaningful lyrics ""Now I know how joan of Arc felt"" What the????Give me Celine Dion anyday!!!!!!She is the queen of Lyrics ""Near far whereever you are""BRILLIANT!!!!!!!That guy from The Smyths could only dream of lyrics like this!!!!!FACTAlso get into acts like Good Charlotte, Busted, and Mcfly, these are the true and greatest genius's of music, this is just whingy noise, not music.Also buy U2's lastest album, it is MILES BETTER than thisTRUST MEpop Idol is the future, this should be left to gather dust in the past!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.SThe E stands for Expert!!!!!!SEE YA"
3,Be Cautious - The Advertising Is Misleading,I do not own this product but I have been reviewing methods to extend Firewire (IEEE 1394) signals.Just one of these devices is intended to extend a Firewire signal only up to 33 feet. The idea is that you can 'daisy chain' several devices to extend a Firewire signal a considerable distance but doing this will run up the cost.
2,Too many unsubstantiated statements,"I stopped reading this book when it said that low self-esteem is a possible cause of thyroid antibodies. I'm a research psychologist and am very familiar with psychosomatic research, so I feel qualified to say that this is complete hooey. There are too many sections in this book that smack of unscientific thinking and unsubstantiated comment. I bought this book hoping for practical advice, and there is some of that. But there is also a fatal overdose of hippie stuff. A better book is Mary Solomon's What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Hypothyroidism."
2,Infomercial in paper back,"Book does has good information about thyroid issues, I just felt by the end of the book, author was just promoting his vitamins."
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed at the content of the book. The emphasis being on more of a ""eastern"" medicine approach to dealing with the disease. I felt the title of the book was a misrepresentation of the content completely. Meditation, visualization and proper diet are all valid ways to combat the disease but the book did have the flavor of a introduction to eastern religion. Not at all appropriate for the average person I thought, mearley a thinly disquised play at indoctorination. I actually wanted to return the book. Sincerly, Tanya k Allen"
3,some good info,have to say I was a bit disappointed with some of the misinformation in this book.if I were not well versed with thyroid issues I might have bought in to the misinformation
3,"part of ""Firm: Body Sculpting System: 3-in-1 Workout""","This workout is from ""Firm: Body Sculpting System: 3-in-1 Workout"". If you bought the Firm Sculpting Stick package, that DVD was included. I think Amazon sells DVD only here:THE FIRM - Body Sculpting System (3 Pack)."
2,"The Opera is Incomplete, and in Glassy Sound","This DVD of the 1974 production of Mozart's 'Idomeneo' is a huge disappointment for a number of reasons. For starters, Act I is not given complete. The first scene with Ilia's opening aria, for instance, is simply cut. Richard Lewis, who was a wonderful tenor stalwart in opera and oratorio in his day, is too old to be singing the Cretan King. He is past his prime, sad to say.But what is worse is that the playing and singing are stodgy except for that of Josephine Barstow as Elettra who, true to her character's name, is electrifying. And even worse than that, the recorded sound is glassy and almost unlistenable, at least to my ears.I would think twice about buying this version.Scott Morrison"
1,I have never finished it,"So dull, I have never finished it. Supposedly Barstow is worth it, but I have never gotten to her arias before becoming too bored. The Idamante is a tenor and the scenes are not in the order I am used to. The Idomeneo I am used to begins with the scene with Ilia's aria and then Idamante's entrance and aria. If I remember correctly, this one begins with Idamante finding Idomeneo on the shore, so perhaps the first scene I am used to, is simply cut in this version. I don't know, but I certainly enjoy the Met's Idomeneo video with Pavarotti in the title role much better. I have watched that one through quite a few times. Another great recording of this opera is on cd with Ian Bostridge in the title role."
2,"Nice job, but not great","Well this recording provides a nice introduction to the Roman Trilogy of Respighi. However, the recording lacks in many areas. Though very well played techincally, the interpretation is not great, evn if it is Ormandy at the helm. Ormandy is well established, but he is a man who encourages conductors to add or modify parts such as in Mozart or Beethoven in order to take advantage of the modern Symphony's Capabilities. Anyone who rewrites or edits Beethoven is taking many liberties. As far as this CD is concernd however, it does not have the life or energy that the Philharmonia Orchestra has in its recording. This recording is bland and straight forward. Also, I question the actual recording techniques as well in this CD. If you want a spectacular performnce AND recording to boot, do not buy this CD. Get the Philharmonia Orchesra recording."
5,"A Great, Rare Compilation","I really enjoy listening to this album. The vocal arrangements are top notch. The addition of African drums and electric bass to ""Wade in the Water"" and ""Didn't My Lord Deliver Daniel"" is inspiring. The contemporary gospel sounds of ""You May Run On"" and ""Rocka My Soul"" end the album on an energetic, positive note. Where this album really shines is in its honest and brilliant acapella arrangements. The only bad points are 1)that the fun ends to soon, and 2) the excrutiatingly long (but informative) interview with Judith Jamison at the end."
5,Excellent interpretation of African American genre,"I was very pleased and excited about this work. After seeing the dance company perform ""Revelations"", I found it powerful and cathardic. The music is now apart of my collection and I shall include it in the art of pedadogy. This work is very important to understanding the history of the African American progression in America with Negro Spirituals being parallel. Not enough can be said about this work."
5,Great music. Great memories.,I've seen Ailey's Revelations three times (including the first program) and the passionate gospel music brings back images of the dances. Priceless! I wish there were a DVD of one of the performances.
3,Movie,My son is into all things Loch Ness so I purchased this for him. Cheesy movie and Cheesy special effects. Wonderful transaction at purchase though.
3,find a species thought extinct- kill it,Everyone else has the details. i enjoyed seeing Stargate alums Don Davis (rip) and Paul McGillion in it. More than miffed that any 'scientist' would hunt down and slaughter an endangered species in an isolated area where you could get the people out and save the species' babies at least (even in a monster movie). Annoyed by the end where a major character gets killed and no one notices.
4,Animal Horror,I bought this movie because I liked Brian Krause from Charmed. It was a fun movie to watch.
5,loch ness terror,"This is an awesome movie that Isaw.It has gore,creature violence,action,terror,an explosion.And themost important thing a happy ending.So do more good reviews for thismovie ok."
3,Writing doesn't match the subject,"I've been a fan of the Hart family wrestlers since I was a kid. I have fond memories of watching the Bret Hart and Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart on Maple Leaf Wrestling. The story of the Hart family is the story of modern day wrestling. From the small, regional promoters to the advent of the WWF to the steroid abuse to the over the top stunts that got tragically out of hand, there is no aspect of professional wresling that hasn't impacted directly on Stu Hart and his extended family.His life makes for a fascinating story. It's a shame that Martha Erb's prose is not half as interesting as Stu Hart.I found her writing style to be overly drawn out and somewhat flat. Too often, I found myself struggling to get through chapters that ought to have been riveting. It would have been much more entertaining if she had simply recorded a few hours of Stu Hart talking and then transcribed it to the page.Overall, this is a good book, but not as good as it should be."
1,no longer a fan of Udderly Smooth Udder Cream,"I used Udderly Smooth Udder Cream for many years but since they recently changed their formula I am no longer a customer. The formula used to be Allantoin, Dimethicone, lanolin oil, and Propylene Glycol in an Emollenient base. Whether I got too much sun or my skin was too dry, it made my skin feel wonderful. Now the formula contains Deionized water, Stearic Acid, Peg 2 Stearate, propylene glycol, isopropyl myristate, dimethicone, lanolin oil, mineral oil, triathanolamine, allantoin, methylparaben, propylparaben, fragrance and it just doesn't feel the same. But mostly, I will no longer buy it because it contains parabens which may be linked to breast cancer. As a recent breast cancer survivor I am very careful about the products I use on my skin."
5,The Best!,"I love this stuff! I was so bummed when Trader Joe's stopped carrying it. It's smooth, light, not greasy or overly scenty and just soaks right in. I'm glad to find it in bulk."
3,Good for summer,I like this moisturizer. Skin looks very good after using it. I don't like the smell. ooo oooo oooo ooo
3,Good Value,I used Udderly Smooth many years ago and thought I'd try it again. One of my friends swore by it back then. I use it before I go to sleep and it does a good job on moisturizing my hands and arms. I have two other creams that are in dispensers that I think are better for severe dryness and cracking. I plan to give one of the two jars I bought as a gift to my friend. I'll report back on whether she is as pleased with it as 20 years ago.
2,"This cream is too light, not suitable for extra dry skin.",When using this cream I added a natural oil which helped somewhat. The cream alone did not help with my dry skin. I won't be buying again.
1,Damaged item,this is the item i ordered however I received a damaged item. it could be it was damaged originally or got damaged during shipping.
3,Cart,I was very pleased with the cart as far as size and maneuvering but it discolored when left outside and that was very disappointing.
2,ridiculously difficult to assemble,"This item was described as easy to assemble but after working on it for two days, we had to return it. We called the company twice but all they told us was that they had a lot of complaints regarding assembly and were not nice nor helpful."
3,Review of Utility cart,"The product was nice but I was surprised by the total price and the high shipping cost. Similar products can be purchased in local stores for less without the exorbitant shipping costs. For items that customers have to buy without actually touching & feeling for quality and sturdiness, lower cost is the only incentive for internet purchasing. Personally, if the prices are comparable, I would buy an item locally rather than pay for shipping."
4,Watch out for poor packaging,"This is a standard wire shelf cart. The wheels are better than average, while everything else is just average. Manufacturers keep swapping out for cheaper wheels so it's nice to see a product that still has nice wheels.Now about the packaging: When I unboxed the cart, I noticed the zip ties had already been cut. No matter, the spacers between the shelves were still there and nothing was missing. When I tried assembling the cart, I noticed that each of the shelves were warped slightly different from each other. I had to find the right order of shelves to get it to assemble, but once I did, it fit together easily. The warping is so slight enough where it's not noticeable it on the assembled cart. There are some scuffs where I had to fight against to warped shelves to figure out the right order."
2,Great Idea ... BAD Product,"I bought this particular cart to use as a part of my at-home dialysis set-up. The size was perfect and the price for a stainless steal cart was great. Unfortunately, that's about all I can say that is of a positive nature. Who ever designed this thing must have never tried to assemble it, no less use it for anything. Instructions were poor to non-existent and I still have a bunch of pieces that I'm not sure even belong to this product. I would return the stupid thing, but I had to cut the box up to get it out. Oh well, Amazon you got me this time!"
2,Junk cart,"The package containing the cart arrived on Thursday and sat in its box in the house on Friday. When I arrived home from work Friday evening I wondered what the very strong, unpleasant smell in my house was. Turned out to be the cart's wheels which smelled like creosote. Sickening.I left all the pieces outside overnight and washed the wheels Saturday to try to eliminate the stink. Decided it would probably have to be an outside cart for gardening chores. However, I may never get it completely put together as the top shelf is so difficult to fit on the posts I haven't been able to do it. Trying to hammer the top shelf over just enough to fit the last post in its hole, a piece of the wavy decoration around the edge fell off.I've put together a number of wire shelves and have always been able to fit them together myself. This cart is a big disappointment."
5,Love this,"I needed something to hold my stacks of genealogy paperwork. This cart is just great. It's sturdy and has wheels. Now I don't have to physically carry reams of paper from one room to another. If I had room, I'd buy a few more of these."
5,Great Quality,Well worth the money! Easy to put together. No tools required. Very heavy duty and handy. Would consider giving as a gift.
5,Great Cart !!,"This is a great product. We have several that we work to death, and they keep rolling.Once someone was playing around with it and broke a wheel and the company sent us a wheel at NO charge.Can't go wrong for the money."
5,all purpose cart- a great item,This cart was easy to put together and it was just what we expected as we already have one. Works great for serving beverages to a group. I would highly recommend this cart.
4,"A solid, well-built cart",It has nice heavy duty casters and is nearly built like a tank. It's very heavy and solid for the price. The chrome plating is nicely done and doesn't look cheap and bubbly/uneven at all. Parts went together quickly and effortlessly and we were using it in no time flat. The recessed shelves were a key feature to prevent items from rolling or falling off the cart easily. We are probably going to buy another.
5,Perfect product,"I should have purchased this earlier. It's making my life so much easier just in schlepping stuff around the house. I no longer have to walk back and forth dozens of times, from one area to another, just to fetch and put things in their proper place. Of course, I feel much like a hotel maid saving steps on old weathered feet. It was rather easy to put together, even though, admittedly, I didn't do it. The instructions appeared to be easy because there were no aside expletives coming from the person who put it together. I didn't think this cart would be as large as it is, and as sturdy. It has a nice, shiny industrial look to it. However, with a tablecloth and/or place mats, some napkins and flowers, it will serve very nicely bringing food from the kitchen to the dining room table."
5,Wow!,"I ordered this for my 88-year-old father to load with staples and meals to make one trip from the kitchen to the breakfast room table. It came amazingly quick and was far superior to my expectations. It went together very quickly, is extremely substantial and rolled like a dream. He is over the moon happy with it. What a great purchase!"
2,Seville Cart,"Completely rusted, 4 months after purchase.I too had difficulty getting the top shelf level.Couldnt get the 4th corner to level out."
4,Seville Utility Cart,"This cart is great - easy to assemble and very sturdy. I am impressed with the ease of wheeling it and the size of the shelves are perfect. I had a smaller version which was cumbersome because the shelves were too narrow. It is convenient for wheeling heavy things. Very elegant, modern and useful!Seville Classics SHE18304 18-Inch by 34-Inch by 33-1/2-Inch Industrial All-Purpose Utility Cart, Chrome"
5,Wire shelf cart,"This is a nice looking cart that was easy to assemble and works great.Note that this model comes with shelves that have lips all around pointing up, making the shelves tray-like. If you need lips down for flat top shelves, look at different models, the shelves have concave mounting holes oriented the certain way and cannot be flipped upside-down.To put the unit together a rubber mallet or a dead-blow hammer is recommended (a sledgehammer with plenty of cardboard for insulation will do in a pinch). Something to cut the box and the wire ties holding the packaging together, and no other tools required."
5,I love this cart!,"I have had it for a couple of years now and it is a trooper. My last residence didn't have room for it in the house so I kept it in the garage with all of my kitchen appliances and utensils. (Covered with a dust cover). When I wanted to do a bunch of cooking and baking... I just wheeled the cart in with all of my large pots and baking utensils. Worked out great! Now... in my new home... I keep my kitchenaid mixer and the food processor on the top and just wheel it up to the kitchen counter to do my baking and cooking. Just wheel it back to its own little corner when finished.Again... it works out wonderfully. This way I have easy access to all of my large appliances without them taking up precious countertop ""real estate"" and I don't have to haul them out of the back of a cupboard. I have a large, thick cutting board on the top shelf for better stabilization of them when they are in use."
4,Great cart!,"I have really enjoyed using my new cart around the office . . . I only gave it 4 stars because the holes that you line up on each shelf were a little ""wonky"" but with a little muscle and help I was able to put it together in no time . . . This cart is very sturdy and has been a great asset to my office :)"
5,you get a lot for a moderate cost-- very satisfied,"This was very reasonably priced, and I was pleased to see that it was a heavy duty vehicle that can handle a lot of weight-- unlike many of the cheaper ones on the market. Fairly easy to put together. Takes up some space, but perfect for laundry, transporting things between the car and the house, storing kitchenware and appliances, whatever. 3 levels useful for sorting. the wheels work well, make it maneuverable despite its length. Highly recommend!"
5,Sturdy Utility Cart,Every home needs a cart like this. We use it for all kinds of things such as bringing in groceries in from the car and as a portable work bench in the garage and in my home computer repair business. The cart is very strong and easy to keep clean. I love it and consider getting a second one. The price was reasonable too. I would recommend this cart to my friends.
5,Great computer cart.,Easy to put together. Holds heavyweight stuff. Sturdy and movable so I can take my computer from room to room.
5,All Purpose Utility Cart,"This was an early Christmas present for my husband. He was planning to smoke several fresh hams as holiday gifts for friends. Our smokehouse is approximately 50 yards from the house. Needlesstosay, this utility cart eliminated many steps back and forth from our front door. It is very sturdy and was easy to maneuver up and down our ramp and out in the driveway. This gift was most appreciated and will be used again and again!"
2,Great except for rust on metal wheel parts,"I purchased this cart in the last year and its fine in every way except today I noticed the metal parts of all four wheels are now completely covered in rust. Let me assure you the cart was not left in a wet location (a nearby but different cart is fine). Perhaps I just got a bad lot with the wrong parts, or maybe your having the same issue if you purchased the cart?"
4,Gorgeous Serving Plate,"This serving plate is beautiful. However, as with other items in the Pinzon Tomato collection, the bottom of the piece, that would touch the item under it, is not finished smoothly. We cut Easy Liner to fit, to protect the piece beneath it, to solve this. But, we think the quality should be better for the price."
1,This is why opera singers shouldn't attempt standards,"I'm a fan of Marilyn Horne, but this recording was truly a mistake. These songs are *so* overdone anyway, they really ought to be shelved for the next 50 years. But on top of that, Ms. Horne is rarely in tune here, and if you add to that Thomas Hampson and Jerry Hadley, you won't be able to fast forward through it fast enough. Kudos to Spiro Malas, who manages to come off unscathed. When you've got Marilyn Horne (in her repertoire), you don't need any of these beasts."
2,"If your just learning, try a different book.","If you're just getting started, this is not the book for you. It's a little deeper than I expected. Still a good book, but stay clear unless you're already experienced in this topic."
3,Strange,"Interesting premise gets into a lot of navel gazing, finally gets moving, takes a twist, finishes with another and still doesn't satisfy. Could be a good movie with a strong screenplay. Worth a look."
1,stinks,i have read other Brian Keene books and this one stinks. not much of a story. shpuld have been a short story. tommy the main character comlains through out most of the book. Very pridictable outcome. not much action or suspence. i do not recommend this at all
2,Far From His Best...,"Sadly the last two novels written by Mr. Keene (Urban Gothic, and this drivel), have been far too ""urban"". While it is obvious he and I are near the same age, and share (or shared...while growing up) many of the same pastimes, his recent books show he either spent too much time in the inner-city, or was one of those people who liked to seem ""street""...even though he is far from it. This story was slow, and often dull, another shame given his previous works. If your a fan of Mr. Keene, then please skip this one. Only by giving him a flop (and this is one) will he return to writing quality horror fiction. Sorry but this is just plain bad writing."
4,Students for Life Sows Success Seeds!!!,"Grant and Thomas have created the book that I wish I could have read when I was preparing for college many years ago. Students of Life is an inspiring and information-packed read that should be required reading for any young person determined to make something of themselves.Shawn Dove, Vice PresdientMENTOR/National Mentoring Partnership"
5,Knowledge equals speculation accompanied by experience,"The word perfect shouldn't even exist because it is clear, we as humans are constantly developing. At birth we are buds and later, gradual unfolding petals....the book narrows in on the fact that it is possible to have an extremely satisfying life, if we don't merely focus on one aspect such as just school, or just work, but if we combine all our efforts into studying how we can learn from life itself, life is as smooth as the flow of a quiet stream along a bridge. To others it may sound like a fairy tale, but even though the word perfect should not exist, there ARE people that are living quite happily on a day-to-day basis. And this is due in part to the fact they have mastered what it is to be ""Students of Life""."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRINTER! POOR REPAIR SERVICE!,"I bought the printer 6 months ago and after a few months of great pictures there was a white line that developed on thepictures. I had a 1 year warranty to get it repaired and so I sent it to the Olympus Repair Service via mail in great condition. It only had an internal problem. A few weeks laterthe repair center sent me a letter stating that the product's mode dial was broken off, the front CVR cracked, the front door cracked, back cover broken, dented in back. That was completely wrong! It was in fair condtion when the printer was sent there to NY to have it repaired. I rate their service zero stars! I recommend not to buy this product. It was a simple repair that turned into a nightmare. It costed $230.00 to get it repaired. I spent $299.99 for that printer. The company Olympus is a rip-off!I wouldn't buy there products! 1 year warranty! That is so untrue!"
4,An atmospheric gem,"I was quite pleased with this production, though unfamiliar with it, so this was my only exposure. While I can't compare it to other recordings, I was impressed with the music, the wonderful singing, and the outstanding (foreboding) sets, especially June Anderson's arrival by boat--very convincing. My only criticism was that it occasionally had the ""stand-and-deliver"" approach (though not as much as Muti's William Tell), and thus I think it could have benefited by more attention to acting, but I assume this is the director's fault. Nonetheless, this Rossini gem is is quite theatrical and enjoyable."
3,no illumination,This watch is very attractive and stylish. The only pitfall is that its dial is not illuminous making it nearly impossible to see in the dark. If Fossil made the hours and the hands of the watch illuminous it would receive a 5 out of 5 stars.
3,"Other than crap seller and faulty pin, great watch.","I purchased this watch and have overall been very pleased with it. However, just about a month after purchase, a pin broke without any rigorous activity. Mr Watch, the seller, is someone you need to be cautious about. The return policy is extremely misleading. I totally realize it's the buyer's responsibility to read through everything, but who expects a pin to disappear after a month? I've had Fossil watches before that have lasted over a decade. Mr Watch was unaccommodating and did nothing but refer me to Fossil's return policy.1 star lost for Mr Watch's joke of a ""365 day return"" policy (read: as long as you don't even open the box it came in), 1 star lost for a faulty pin that was pretty obviously a defective piece."
4,Exactly what I needed,"The ball mount was perfect, unfortunately, the cost shipping was a bit excessive. I found the exact same mount at Kmart and with todays UPS bulk shipping I could have saved an additional $10."
3,Prime bird vitamins,THIS COTAINER OF PRIME BIRD VITAMINS WAS NOT SEALED AS THEY WERE IN THE PAST. THE VITAMINS ARE A YELLOWISH GREY INSTEAD OF WHITE AS IN THE PAST AND HAS LITTLE BROWN BALLS IN IT. I WONDER IF IT IS OK TO GIVE TO MY BIRD.
4,Time will tell,I acquired the book to teach me how to go after steelhead with spinners from river banks. A wealth of information and confirmed theories I had about fish habits. Very good book and just how good will be tested shortly on a river bank. I have high hopes to successfully apply what Jed is teaching.
1,Don't,"I had one of these for years. I used it to transport my suit to the gym in the morning. I ripped it and had to buy a new one. The one I bought three months ago was noticably thinner and ""shoddier."" The zipper fell off this morning. Save your money."
2,repeticiuos,The author reverts back to all the things that have happened throughout the entire book. Repeats constantly of his hatred for the mafia and the families involved.
3,OK book,"There are 1000 Java books out there, and this is one I had to get for school. I don't even think I opened it up."
4,A nice no-frills collection of Russian short stories,"The Dover Thrift Editions are great affordable collections of some of the world's literary masterpieces. Here we are treated to 12 Russian short stories by some renowned Russian masters and less familiar authors. The stories featured are:""The Queen of Spades"" - Alexander Pushkin""The Overcoat"" - Nikolai Gogol""The District Doctor"" - Ivan S Turgenev""White Nights"" - Fyodor Dostoyevsky""How Much Land Does a Man Need?"" - Leo Tolstoy""The Clothesmender"" - Nicholay Leskov""The Signal"" - Vsevolod M Garshin""The Lady with the Toy Dog"" - Anton Chekhov""The White Mother"" - Theodor Sologub""Twenty-Six Men and a Girl"" - Maxim Gorky""The Outrage - A True Story"" - Alexander Kuprin""Lazarus"" - Leonid AndreyevThis is a nice volume for not only students of Russian literature, but also anyone interested in the genre. The only major flaw in this collection is that the names of the translators are not included."
3,"Better than some Dover translations, worse than others.",A good selection with no information about the translators. Not as clumsy or mistake ridden as some of the books in this series. OK as an introduction.
1,CHEAP!,"CHEAP LOOKING AND ALSO MADE OF CHEAP LEATHER.IF YOU LIKE GREAT LEATHER, SUCH AS THOSE MADE IN ITALY, SPAIN, BRAZIL, YOU WILL NOT FIND IT HERE."
2,Wrong Robert B. Parker,I ordered this book thinking that it was written by the Robert B. Parker whose books that I loved. Unfortunately it was a different author with the same name and did not meet my expectations.
2,Fakeout,"The key point here is that this is not THE Robert B. Parker of Spencer/Stone/Randall fame; since no specific statement about this is made in the offering, this counts as a bait and switch scam and needs to be corrrected."
2,Come On - Robert B. Parker?,"I had actually finished the book before I read the back cover to see that I was mislead about the author. The book was just OK - when I thought the ""living"" Robert B. Parker was trying his hand at a noir novel, I thought that was great and I bought the book on that basis. The book was weak and when when I found out that I had been intentionally mislead (come on - how can it not be intentional?) I was disappointed that Amazon would be involved."
1,Stuipd,"If this is not the Robert B. Parker, author of the Spenser novels, then why don't the stupid people at Amazon fix their web site and remove the reference and pictures of Spenser's Mr. Parker from this book's page? Do your job people."
2,Like walking thru mud,"I bought this book because it was the selection in a monthly reading group for which I belong. I also bought it because I am a huge fan of Mary McCarthy and her straight-forward, no-apologies style of writing. However, I was deeply disappointed in this book.To be honest, I never got past the first chapter. I just couldn't. Carol Brightman may be a brilliant biographer according to some, but to me she is akin to a Literature Professor with far too much time on her hands. She attempts to intellectualize a woman who lived by one credo: honesty in all things, no matter how ugly it is. Brightman uses heavy language and scholarly processes that bog the reader down and make it impossible to love a brilliant woman like Mary McCarthy.If you want to know about Mary McCarthy skip this biography and instead, go read one of Mary's many books and enjoy."
2,Utobia definitely not utopia!!!,"I have had nothing but trouble with this drive. I've tried various configurations and still get a choppy bad picture. I would not recommend this drive. Furthermore, my drive seems to have trouble reading cd-rw's and that really sucks."
4,No more squeaks!,This works very well with the Yamaha mouthpiece (also on Amazon). It really did the trick and stopped the sax from squeaking!
1,Awful Taste -- What a Waste!,This is not like any even half-way decent Pad Thai I have ever had. Don't waste your money. I wish I could figure out how to make this product palatable now that I've purchased so much of it. Ugh.
2,Complete 7 Katas,"This book attempts to clarify the katas.More focus, illustration, and pictures would have been better. Maybe better to stick with one kata and perfect it.There are discrepancies between Kodokan and Kawaishi san."
5,A Must Read For Any Spiritual Seeker,"Taking with the Left Hand for any spiritual seeker is a must read. When one is seeking a spiritual path there are many ""ways"" that one may find and many essence-thieves are waiting for their opportunity to take their advantage. There are people who have invested many years into false teachings, one that has been made up of parts of one teaching and a dash of other teachings then mixing in their own projections and misunderstandings to complete their ""way."" Mr. Patterson has created a book that can be used as a lifeboat when one is drowning in the pool of false teachers."
1,Defective item,"We received the Elvis lamp in a timely fashion.We purchased it as a gift for a friend whose birthday was May 29. We gave it to her on that date and when we put it together, it would not work -- not even the lamp bulb would come on. She was so excited to receive it and we were humiliatedand depressed that it would not work. We were very disapppointed and are now working to return the lamp; the return policy is not helpful and there is no phone for the manufacturer or Amazon."
4,rockin lamp.,"I found this lamp unitended(was looking for (his) movies.Read product describtion and reviews and said this sounds cool and it is.The Lamp it's self is based off the 1968 comeback consert. decked out in his leather (real feeling material),suit.When turned on the lamp plays the Hounddog track from the concert.The song time seems too be the equivalent too the actual performence time.Why I give this 4 stars-from a distence it is realy good looking,upclose,I (you) can see the face simularity needs some work.My 8yr old neicee pointed out that the hands are a bit big.She(thanks too me) is also a fan and is hoping Santa leaves this rockin lamp under the tree this chrismas.A great gift for Elvis fan or people who like too collect modern historical memorbila .This product doesnot have Elvis' autograph or any thing else too indecate offical licened product."
3,Can't use without base,My problem with this carseat is that you can't use it without the base! So if I'm using it with the stroller and want to get into a car with a friend - I cannot. When I traveled not only did I have to check the carseat - but the base as well.The hood is useless and often pulls off the back when pulling it forward. And evenetually creeps back again.I'm lucky enough to have a small baby - 13 lbs and 25 inches at 6 months. Although had I known I couldn't use this until he was a year or more (height restriction) I would not have purchased it. We purchased it because I wanted the light weight Peg Aria storller - which I love - and I didn't want to get a non-Peg carseat - I wanted it to lock in - which it does. I hear Graco City Line or someting has a lightweight stroller and a fashionable carseat - it came out after I purchased my Peg.
2,can't go by reputation alone,"I went by the reputation of the Peg Perego carseat in choosing an infant car seat, but I wish I had spoken to more parents. Although it's an attractive car seat, convenient for taking a sleeping baby out of the car, and worked well with the stroller system, my daughter outgrew it by the time she was two months old. The seat is narrow and she often seemed cramped in there. When putting her in, there was not a way to keep the straps from falling under her, which meant fussing with her to pull the straps out from under her. The material was not breathable, and she was often sweaty when we got her out, even after a short 15 minute car ride. We eventually purchased the Britax Marathon...wish we had done it in the first place."
3,Felt very safe but too heavy,"We loved the safety rating. We loved how snug it fit our daughter. We loved how long it lasted for her (height and weight limits). We loved the look, color, pretty much everything about this carseat but how freakin' heavy it was! We hauled it in and out every single time since we had bases in each car and usually one of us was dropping off and the other picked up. That became a huge chore, especially when you add in a 20-ish pound baby!. As much as we loved this, we would not buy it again if it weighed the same."
2,Great infant carrier with a few drawbacks,"I really like the weight, color, safety ratings and package of the Peg Perego infant seat and stroller, but there are a few drawbacks. The infant seat has low height and weight maxs, the handle is a bit hard to move and the latching into the stroller takes a bit getting used to, but the biggest drawback is needing the base to use the car seat. When the Grandparents want to take her out, or friends offer to drive, they either have to use a different car seat or we have to move the base (a pain). My daughter loves the seat and the strollers, but in retrospect I probably should have gone with Graco - at least the car seat."
2,"OK, but not worth the money ...","I bought this car seat to match my Perego Venezia, and am extremely dissapointed. After everything I heard about how wonderful Perego merchandise is and my own experience (the Venezia is excellent, and the Prima Pappa highchair is a dream), this is quite a let down. My son was born 8lb 10oz at which point he fit quite nicely - without the newborn cushioning! Now at 4 months and almost 18 lb, he has outgrown it. He overheats in it as the seat is so narrow, and is uncomfortable after more than a half an hour, not able to recline more comfortably. I would reccomend the Graco Snugride for a first timer, and at this point we are moving into the Britax Roundabout. I'm sorry to leave my Snap'n'go this early in my sons life though simply because the car seat is just too small. Perego needs to update itself some more in its car seat department!"
2,Wish it was better,We have been using this car seat for 6 weeks now and I wish I hadn't picked it out because of its name. It's not very comfy for him. I always have trouble opening the canopy without it comming off the back. The straps don't pull out easily and I always have a hard time with my sons arms. I don't have trouble getting it out/in the base. It's very light weight.
1,"attractive, but uncomfortable","i am a new mom of a 4 month old boy. we got this car seat based on no experience with children. i liked the way it looked, and all the car seats looked the same to me, anyway! our son hates this car seat. he cries almost every time we put him in it, i suppose because it is not comfortable for him. he is only 15 lbs. and already seems to be too big for it, even though it is supposed to go up to 22 lbs. it is awkward and heavy to carry. live and learn, i guess!"
1,NIght Mask,"Book was delivered in the conditioned promised but that is the only positive about the book. I am a huge William Johnstone fan, but ""Night Mask"" was possible the worst book I've EVER read. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
3,Camera part very good....Clip is horrible and doesnt work....,"As a Skype user I wanted to be able to use it along with video on my Toshiba 13"" laptop when travelling. I have a Logitech camera for my desktop so decided to purchase one suitable for my laptop also. Easy, just clip it to the screen and plug it in. Well, the camera functions just fine except it keeps falling off the screen. Luckily I'm a fairly DIY kind of person so was able to ""jury rig"" a working fix using a thick sticky pad. My advice to Logitech....stay with the electronics and go hire a competent mechanical design engineer to design a workable clip. Further advice to laptop designers...why dont you add a USB socket to the top of the screen so web cams can be designed to plug directly in and then they won't fall off.... just a thought."
2,Does Not Work on Skype,"I purchased this item to use with my laptop for calls on Skype when I am on one of my many business trips. I have not been able to get it to work. I get a very nice video image for exactly 10 seconds and then either the image freezes or I get a blank green screen. Tech help at Logitec is the canned variety (if your question/problem isn't listed, tough luck) and has been no help. The camera itself works fine -- it works without a problem on my home desktop computer. The issues appears to be in the software: I loaded the software on my laptop (as the printed instructions emphsized) where it doesn't work, but I did not load the software on my desktop where it now does work. The problem might be the result of high resouce requirements of the software that some other reviews have cited. Anyway that's just a guess from one who's not all that technically literate. Bottom line for me is: this doesn't do what I bought it to do."
5,Great item for the price!!!,"Not award winning video quality, but good for the money. Consider buying this only if you are looking for a decent webcam for chat/ TP stuff and not expecting all the bells and whistles that comes with a high-end one. You get what you pay for!Easy to set up. Quick plug and play install. Bag is nice to store and keep camera protected.I consider this a good buy."
3,not bad for a cheap fix,"My wife had some trouble getting it to work(and she has a doctorate), it works now. Picture quality is fair, we got it on sale, so it was worth the price."
1,can't review - never got it - can't get vendor to email back!,DO NOT use this vendor - they have my money and never shipped the product!
3,Didn't pay alot so not too dissapointed!,"first thing i had to do was get a windows 7 driver from their website, no biggie. another first thinger was cam doesn't clip onto my laptop, dell 1545, very well, and cable dictates where it will rest, kind of a pain. performance is so so, video is choppy, not sure if it has something to do with my laptop or the cam. i think i paid about 12 bucks for this thing, im not that dissapointed. i may look into a newer better cam."
3,Decent but bad lighting,"Great webcam if you are looking for something cheap. The quality is decent, but it has the following problems:-Poor focus-Poor lighting, especially if you are somewhere dim.I'd recommend spending an extra few bucks to get a nicer one."
1,Be Warned - Clip Breaks!,"I've had a Logitech camera like this one for 2-3 years now, and use it regularly. This morning, the clip that holds the camera on the laptop broke. I've taken extremely good care of the camera, so I can only attribute this damage to regular use and conclude that this is a design flaw for this particular product. I would not buy this product again, based on this flaw."
4,"i love it, but....","i love my logitech webcam a lot! this is definitely for someone who wants a mac with photobooth, but can't have one for some reason. it has a ""built in"" photobooth with effects that you can download from the website. this works with my AIM, and i love it! not as many effects as i would like, but it's fine. this is not the premium logitech camera so it does not have the ability to download ALL of the effects from the logitech website, which was a bit disappointing.this camera also has a button that when u click, it takes a picture. you can also record videos, which is a plus. picture quality 1-5 is about a 4. not ahmaaahzing, but definitely clear. all in all, great product with the limited effects being the only con."
2,Horrible,"Picture is jumpy and color is off for people I am talking to. Software also conflicts with existing audio drivers. I tried it on both of my computers, which are relatively new and powerful."
4,Logitech WebCab,It is a good webcam. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it will not link up with google chat and that is the specific reason why I bought it so I just might be a little bitter.
2,lens fell out,"I had this webcam for about a month and the lens fell out. I couldn't find it, so I had to purchase a second webcam. So far so good, I am not impressed with the video quality. I only use it occasionally, so it will suffice."
2,This was sent as a gift...bad choice,"Logitech QuickCam Deluxe for Notebooks (Silver)I sent this as a gift so we could use Skype to tutor our friend's children. The camera software caused their notebooks to crash and has caused ongoing havoc with their computer. Instead of helping we caused a lot of headaches. I should have heeded the reviews but I was a Logitech fan. Alas. Now that I think about this, I want to change the rating to 1 star."
5,Logitech QuickCam Delux,This was very easy to setup and works great. The directions were very user friendly for someone that is computer challanged.
3,Great value,"Pretty nice little camera for the price. Although the image quality/resolution cannot compare with high end/higher priced 'pro' Logitech cameras, it is better than having no picture at all. Also, built in microphone helps a lot. Great buy for the price."
2,Nothing special,"I have another no-brand webcam with the same specs as this one. It cost me $10 and it works OK, I bought this webcam because I thought I would have better image quality but this camera works just the same. Nothing special."
4,good stuff,"I like it and would recommend it to anyone. I bought it with [...] dollars rebate, so the price was good also."
1,easily fall off mu computer,and the quality of pics are low. don't recommend.for 10 or 20 you can get a much better one.
3,Not a bright background,"so this is defintely the cheapest looking cam, but not the best. i am a big chatter my self and usually use my webcams on the webcam chatrooms, and if i turn off the light and want to be on the dark. its really not much visible. you will have a tough time even locating your face. its a very tiny cam. good to use in tiny places or even to move around the area. but it wasnt the best for me. unfortunally didnt solve my problem much. my old webcam was having wire functionin problems. and this webcam only solved my webcam loss about 50% percent.... i guess i shouldve read ""quickcam is a little differnt than Webcam"""
3,Not entirely Mac Compatible,"We bought this because we heard (at a store) that it was Mac Compatible. It is very easy to use with a Mac, but does not have any of the additional features. The software it comes with is not Mac friendly. Overall, it works fine, but has been tough to find a way to focus it consistently."
4,More than acceptable,"Works great for skype (built-in microphone is more than sufficient), and with the $30 rebate, it was a fantastic deal. A quality product all around.The only trouble I've had with it was that even with adjusting the settings and lowering the exposure as much as possible, the image was still rather overexposed when I was sitting outside in direct, bright sunlight. Indoors at night, though, it seems to do just fine."
5,Great basic webcam,"Great basic webcam to use with Skype, Gmail video chat, etc. No need to install the Logitech software, Windows XP detects and installs needed drivers automatically. Only basic configuration of chat clients needed. Picture and sound are good quality, however low light performance suffers. Very easy to use! Highly recommended."
1,DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA,"Even though it advertises having 1.3 megapixels, the resolution is very poor. It's marginal for small sizes, and way too blurry when you go full screen. I recommend the Logitech Pro 9000 (2MP) instead, though it's twice the price."
3,quickcam deluxe,Not sure if its the camera or my internet connection but the test I ran on it was really delayed picture quality
4,Quickcam,Just got this webcam today it works great. Has nice video effects works well EVEN WITH THE INSTALLED SOFTWARE!!!
4,like it!,This webcam is really great and easy to use. The only issue I have with it is that it does not clip onto my computer very well. It takes a bit of adjusting to get it where I need it without it sliding down or falling off. But once it is in place it works really well.
3,not so great,hard as hell to set up if your internet connection is crap. the mega pixles are too small to even notice any facial features.
4,"Works Great, simple, great price!","It is simple enough for someone that doesn't know how to use computers to figure out (my mother in-law) and it works great. Definitely a buy, and just like all my other experiences with Logitech."
4,Great camera,"Exactly what I expected, great sound and picture quality (as long as it is a quiet room)"
3,"Good camera, but driver package needs to be sorted out","I have purchased two other Logitech cameras in the past and was satisfied with both of them. This is my worst experience with a Logitech camera.While the camera works very well, Logitech still needs to sort out the driver package a bit. I installed this on a relatively new Dell laptop running Windows Vista, following all of Logitech's instructions. Neither the Logitech QuickCam software nor any other software could detect the camera. Installing the Vista Service Pack, reinstalling the drivers, trying the newest versions of the drivers from the Logitech website, etc. failed to work. Finally I discovered thanks to a tech forum on the web that many other people have experienced this problem and that it can easily be fixed by editing the Registry with regedit. After I did that, the camera worked perfectly.Logitech needs to fix their installation package."
5,Logitech QuickCam - Works Flawlessly,"We liked the first Logitech QuickCam Deluxe enough that when we were looking for a webcam to give as a gift for someone else, that was our first choice. The colors are well balanced, even in low light conditions. And the video and sound come through smooth. The camera installed just fine and works flawlessly."
3,Works okay but cannot see any difference from others,This webcam works okay for the price but does not seem to pick up sound quite as well as the desktop model of similar cost. Neither of them have the lighting flexibility of the slightly higher priced camera I use at home. I certainly do not see why they emphasize a different camera for notebooks; the desktop model worked just as well when I tried it out.
4,Great little webcam,I have never bought one before but read the reviews and purchased this. I really like the camera. It is a bit big but it comes with a small little carrying bag. I like the software. It did take me a bit to figure it out but when it is installed it worked great with Skype. That is the main reason I bought it. Buy it!
2,"Description is wrong, only 640x480 not 1.3 MP","I just got the camera yesterday, and discovered that it only has a VGA sensor (640x480) not the 1.3 megapixel sensor advertised. It generates the 1.3 megapixel images through ""software interpolation""."
4,Very good webcam,Small and convenient portable webcam. It provides clear slow motion picture and the user can take his picture by himself without any help from other people. Over all it's a very good quality webcam.
1,Not on par with Logitech quality!!!,"Very, very unhappy with this item. The picture is dull, not very clear. I have a high quality webcam from Logitech which is superb that I use on my pc but wanted a smaller one for my laptop. My sole use of the cam is for Skype video calls. I was fooled by the ""Deluxe"" in the name. I've always expected ""deluxe"" to be of a higher quality. Since it was Logitech, I trusted... more fool I. There was absolutely NO comparison. While I didn't expect the same level as on the more expensive - but reasonable for the quality (Pro 9000), I wasn't expecting something worse than anything I've ever seen. It was in the package new but of course I had to open it to find out what it was like. I didn't even have to install the software because of the Logitech software already installed but now I can't return it. ...because the pkg was opened!!! Duh, how else would I know if it is satisfactory??? I am VERY unhappy with this cam and this deal."
4,"Great ""WEBCAM""","Before I bought this webcam I read several reviews on it and seen people criticizing it for the softwares it comes with. I have used this webcam with two different machines with different configurations - one was a modern desktop computer with a Core 2 Duo (2.66GHz) processor and a 3 GB RAM plus 250 GB HDD ;other one was my >2 years old laptop with Pentium M (1.73GHz) processor with 1.2GB RAM plus 60GB HDD.The installation was little slower in my laptop but there was almost no difference in the performance of the camera in the two systems. Lot of people have complained about this product being slow in their machine (laptop) but I think the problem is overhyped.If you are looking for a nice webcam, do not look any further. The video quality is really great and it works absolutely fine with Windows Live messenger and Yahoo messenger (I have used these two).I trusted Logitech for their mice and keyboards (no doubt they are the best). Now I love their webcams too."
4,Great camera for my kids to talk to their Grandparents!,"This was an upgrade from an older camera. MUCH better! Not award winning video quality, but good for the money.The software lacks some nice features that the next logitech model up offers. And that is why I gave 4, not 5 stars. But I am very happy with it for how we are using it. Pretty smooth video makes for a much more enjoyable time talking to my parents online.Easy to set up. Quick if you follow the directions. Bag is nice to store and keep camera protected.I would consider this a good buy."
3,good webcam but does not work with skype,"This is a nice webcam with good quality video, but I could not get it to work properly with Skype. All I could see was a B&W video with bars, works well with Yahoo. It also has some issues with automatic adjustment of contrast in uneven lighting, unlike my previous 3com homeconnect webcam which broke :("
2,Poor Skype Cam,"I use this webcam mostly with Skype and I am always disappointed in the picture quality. I've tried changing the room lighting and played with the camera's setting without much luck. If you are looking for a webcam to use with Skype, keep looking as this is not it."
3,Not bad little camera for Skype,"Not a bad little camera. After a little research before buying, I went with the plug-n-play mode instead of installing all the Logitech software, which sound like the main cause of the negative reviews. It works fine without installing the software. The microphone is good, the picture a little dark but certainly manageable with a little attention to lighting (i.e. don't be totally backlit). This is on Skype even on a less than ideal internet connection. Nice way to stay in touch."
1,Problems,The sound stops randomly stops working. Will not always respond to start recording. Disappointed.
1,Bad design,"The camera is great!. But the clip which attaches it to the laptop is very very inconvenient. Its very tight and broke after a few days. Now without the clip, its totally useless.We have to pull the clip apart with both hands to fit it to the laptop screen. I wonder how logitech came up with such stupid clip design."
3,a cute webcam for the notebook,"this webcam fits the notebook quite well, it can be adjustable to different size. but the quality is not quite well. i mean, not very clear when used at night with lights."
4,good webcamera,"It's good camera, focus well and lightening well. but can't fit very well on my dell 1505."
4,On-the-Go Webcam for Laptop,"We bought the Logitech QuickCam Deluxe to use on our laptop to keep in touch with family while we were traveling on vacation. We already have the 9000 for our PC and really like the 9000. The QuickCam's picture isn't quite as good, but good enough that young grandchildren recognized where we were by the building in the background. The QuickCam was easy to install and fits in the pocket of our laptop's carrier."
1,Not Suggested,"Hi,The product is not suggested. Very Very poor image quality. Not worth for money i spent. Friends who see me online cannot recognise my face.No improvement after changing various setting also.No more."
4,"Good Picture, Bad Design","The cam doesn't stay clipped to my laptop very well, but the picture quality is pretty good. The next laptop i buy will def have a built in cam because traveling with this (even with the provided case) in a hassle as well. It's easy to install and works well with skype so overall i would reccommend it."
4,Great webcam,"I have always been buying logitech webcams for their performance. The earlier webcam I bought (quick cams) but they used to get hot very quick. But this one is super cool. Good picture quality. I generally do not use the logitech mic because of echo issues, but this one has good mic.I have a IBM thinkpad. though it does not confortably fit in the laptop screen to hold it properly, it should be ok with other models.Highly recommended."
4,for my son,"i bought a new dell laptop with cam built in, retired my old dell to my son. figure to get him a cam as well so we can see each other. pricing was very attractive. the design is quite stylish. performace is great and comes with good software. only complaint is the clip design. it does not stay on the screen very well. overall, good buy.wiru"
3,Okay but not great. Price is right ...,"Well, for 8.99 after a $30 rebate I can't complain. It's a nice little web cam with a nice short cord which is good if you only use it on your laptop. Clip works okay but is not real steady. It is good enough though. The cam does not work well in low light even with the low light boost. I compare it to my other Logitech QCAM V-UAX16 QuickCam Pro 5000 which is now obsolete but the old one is sharper and is better in low light and the color is a bit more true."
5,Nice little camera..,Worked just fine out of the box. I use it to work with my collaborator using Skype...it has all the features needed. I was dubious about the mic but it works well without picking up feedback from speakers. Well made.
5,Insight and Inspiration for Parents and Parents to Be,This is THE book to begin and end with ( with a generous dose of neurocardiology journals and laughter meditation practice along the way ) to liberate the spirits of our future.
4,An insight into that impenetratable Third Wave crowd,"This book offers an incredible look at the issues that constantly face the younger generation of feminists, even those who are male. I think it has been a long time coming, even though she was much criticized for allowing so many voices that seem offbeat to fill the pages. I found, however, that those are the voices of many and they need to be heard. Thank you, Rebecca Walker for such an comforting look that my life is actually normal-my concerns are not only voiced by myself, but by thousand of other feminists across the nation. It is very important to keep the younger generation in print so we do not lose touch with the old school feminists who are dealing with issues that pertain to their ages. An excellent read for just that bridging of the generation gap."
4,"Insighful, yet a tad misleading","I think this book is great and it has some of the most interesting stories I've read about modern feminism to date. There is a wide variety of essays ranging from militant feminism to black feminism to male feminism to a supermodel's opinions on being feminist. The only gripe I would have about this book is the fact that several of the articles seemed to escape the issue of feminism and dwell entirely on racial and anti-white issues. Overall though, the context of the well-written essays far outweighed the poorly-written ones."
5,South American - Brazilian - humor,"Great book; Latin humor at its best. Funny story about a henpecked man who, post-retirement, revolts against his shrewish-wife and daughter, and resurfaces several years later as the ""king of the hobo's"" down at the docks...I'd tell you more, but you'll have to read for yourself. This is one of a few books I give as a gift."
5,A Nikon for the ages - D2X,"This camera is so good a lot of people think it's bad. That is to say, it's resolution is so high that it exposes every bad thing about your lower quality lenses or photographic technique. To say that it's the best-ever digital camera would not be an overstatement. It's autofocus, metering and color are truly wonderful and I have no criticisms. A solid build and stellar performance in every way. This one won't be obsolete in a year."
4,What a beautiful voice,This artist would DEFINITELY be a big success in the US if only they'd release her album here. Her voice is absolutely gorgeous and the melodies of her songs are memorable. Buy this album and you won't be disappointed.
5,Astronaut Peaches,"Yum, delicious, with all the nutritious goodness of peaches. Low calorie, no fat, cholesterol, or sodium. Great snack. Because they're dried peaches, they're really sweet."
3,Ok product,"The switch works and sets easily enough. Instructions would have helped. The 1/4 inch compression fitting had a piece of plastic inside that pushed the tubing out, preventing a good seal."
5,Track listings,1. Spaceman2. King Sun3. Last Destination4. Miami Playtime5. High Life6. Apologies7. Ocean part Il8. Butterfly Kiss9. Woman Next Door10. Ocean part I11. Discolight12. Wedding Song
5,great deal,"it may not be brand name OEM but works just as good, and at a fraction of the cost, I'm very satisfied"
4,Great commentary on the parables,"This book offers a straight forward discussion of the major parables of Christ. It never strays off from the main theme and launches into irrelevant and long-winded 'sermons'. If it's precise, on-the-dot infomation you are seeking, look no further - this book fits the bill!All the parables are discussed individually, so there's no need to read the book in sequential order. Just dip straight into the parable that interest you!A great reference book for those who has a basic acquaintance with the Gospels. Beginners can benefit from it also."
3,good enough,The product works well for the most part but sometimes it decideds not to. it is a great product overall for a first time buy or a first time user.
5,Did what it said it would,I bought this productafter searching many websites. It does what it says it does. And I would recommend it for the money I pd.
5,GREAT little tuner for little dough!,"This little tuner suits my tuning needs just fine without having to litter my pedal board with overpriced pedal tuners, although this tuner does have the 1/4 inch inputs to incorporate them if you wanted to.All in all, it tunes my guitars just fine and probably the best tuner for the money out there!"
4,Chromatic for the Professional,"As a working professional(45years)I am often having to tune from standard a-440down to a-flat.Jimmi Hendrix and many other guitar and bass players find that dropping the standard E-chord to E-flat allows a more fluid playability a more heavy tone more distance in string bending.My favorite gigs usually require this.But sometimes you find yourself on a studio call and you generally have to bring it back to standard quickly.This Korg does the job.Plus you can set it to fine tune thirds,fourths,fifths for accuracy across the board which is required for a guitar to fully reach it's harmonic capacity.It's also good for occasional saddle adjustment.I've used very expensive Peterson strobe tuners which are just not practical for the musician on the go.The Korg CA-40 is dirt cheap and reliable.These are the reasons i own one and use it.Korg CA-40 Large Display Auto Chromatic Tuner"
4,For my daughter,"We bought my thirteen year old daughter a guitar and bought this tuner to go with it. I don't know exactly how it works, but she seems to be happy with it."
5,Awesome!,This tuner works great! I like that you don't have to plug it in and it picks up sound really well.
4,KORG CA-40 Chromatic Tuner,I had been using a tuner that clips on the neck of my ukulele and it can be a bit cumbersome to use. The KORG is easy to sit on my knee and tune with. It is VERY accurate and easy to read. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to be able to accurately tune your uke or guitar.
5,Very sensitive,"This tuner works fine and is worth the small amount I paid for it. It is very sensitive. I have to turn the cooler (which plays Bb) off before I use it. One drawback. You must shut it off when you're done, otherwise it will be ruined. I have another tuner that shuts off automatically. I always do shut them off, but I prefer the safety feature. Both tuners are accurate, simple, easy to understand and use."
5,great tuner,"this is a great tuner with good accuracy for tuning piano keys. it has simple menus, and product is very portable and inexpensive."
3,Korg CA-40 Tuner,"This is a fine tuner. My only complaint is that although it covers the range A0-C8, it gives no indication of the octave on the display (e.g., it just shows ""D#"" instead of ""D#3"")."
5,another great Korg tuner,I have 2 Korg tuners and bought this one just to try out another model. All models work well with no problems at all.
5,Exactly what we wanted.,"We were looking for a tuner for my daughter to use for her violin. Her violin teacher has one that is just like this, so my daughter asked that we purchase it. We have not been disappointed. She has used it for tuning as well as helping her with finger placement when in various new positions until she gets the muscle memory for placement. We are very satisfied with this."
4,Typical tuner,I've had several Korg tuners over the years (flautist) and they are good quality but sometimes don't have amazing response to pitch.
4,Quick and Handy,"This is a great tuner. It picks up sounds very well and quickly. You could be humming across the room, and it would probably pick it up. It's that sensitive. The little flip-up piece in the back allows it to stand. It is easy to use and easy to read. You just turn it on, play a note, and see if the green light shows up (the left red light means the note is too low, and the right red light means the note is too high). And it's nice that it tells you the note that you're playing. The only thing I wish is that it had a light inside because I have a hard time reading the screen (to see the letter of the note) without proper lighting. It can also be helpful for guitar players because it seems to allow you to keep it plugged in between the instrument and the sound system so you can still play (I'll have to look at those instructions again!)."
4,Korg Tuner,"I have owned many tuners over the years, and several of them are just plain terrible. I cannot stand when you pluck a note and the tuner needle jumps around all over the place! This tuner does not do that, and seems to be very accurate. Korg makes good stuff, and they include the batteries too! There are features on this tuner that I will never use, as I just use it for standard tuning, but if you need the features, I'm sure they are nice to have!"
4,mostly wonderful,"This tuner is very sensitive and easy to use. The LCD display has a very 'natural' feel to it as a 'galvanometric needle' display, and the LED lights finish the touch. The pick-up is sensitive.Certainly for my purposes, guitar tuning, it is beyond adequate.My complaint: The LCD display is hard to read in low light. Yet, it seems a suitable compromise in terms of its other properties of power consumption, size, portability, etc.It is an extremely good value for the price."
4,Good tuner,"my only complaint with this tuner is the fact that it doesnt have a transpose function, which this is not a big deal at all. I play trumpet, and it picks up on my instrument in all ranges just fine. super easy to use, and really useful."
3,However,Reasonably packaged. Hardware functions as designed. However my non musical inputs reqired help to get it to work on our Violin. Everything adjusted to sharps as received. Better instructions would be very helpful.
5,Great compact tuner!,"I have been using this little tuner for my classical and electric guitar tuning for the past 2 years, with no complaints. Large enough display with spot on tuning, and no lag, whether I use the mic or direct input. After two years, I'm still on the original AAA battery. Probably the best compact tuner I have used in my 40+ years of playing."
5,great tuner,"Already had one of these, but wanted an extra to use upstairs in the house (my studio is in the basement, but I have guitars on both floors).It works great, very simple to use; easy to read.I'd definitely recommend it."
5,Excellent Tuner,This is one of the best tuners for the price I have found. Does everything that you need in a nice large display.
5,Great Little Tool,"This thing is great! I built a Heathkit/Thomas organ in the 1970's and had a difficult time with the tuning procedure in the manual. I eventually tuned it using an old accordion as a reference. It was close but never right on and I don't have a good ear for this. I don't think anything like this was available in the '70's, if it was I was unaware of it as well as were the Heathkit people. If it did exist at that time I am sure it would have been very expensive, I would have easily paid the $15 for this even in 1970's money. The tuning of this organ with this tool was ridiculously easy and much less expensive then having it professionally tuned. I would highly recommend this tool."
5,tuner,"Nice tuner locks right on, just play any note or chord displays in a readout and the needle and leds tell you if it is sharp or flat, great for drop tuning and checking your guitars intonation. Like the input and output jacks so I can run straight through to my amp and just leave it on."
4,Korg CA-40 Tuner,"Seems to be accurate. I do not have to fine tune the guitar after using it like I did with my old tuner. Is easy to read considering my declining eyesight. Wish it had a backlight but other than that it is an excellent buy for the money. In fact, I may even buy another one for my backup guitar."
4,Great for beginners,Am a new guitar player. Always had problems tuning the guitar by ear. I love this korg tuner because of the input don't need to go through a mic which you will have to deal with the positioning and the environment sounds. Just plug in and tune. Allows you to tune very fast. Definitely recommended for beginners.
4,"Great, simple to use tuner","I just bought this tuner to use with my new mandolin, and reviewers here (and a family member) steered me right. The CA-30 and CA-40 tuners are good affordable tuners to support those learning to tune their acoustic instrument.On the plus side, the tuner is sized to fit in most instrument cases' equipment pocket, which keeps it safe and handy. Don't hesitate on this if the price is still discounted.I took a star off for a rather brief manual, and lack of FAQs and such on the Korg site. Though the CA-40 has a built-in stand, it has no backlight, which I would've preferred for dark stages where it could be used with an optional microphone.NOTE: This item has been tagged as a metronome, it DOES NOT feature metronome functions."
2,Can't tune a piano with Korg CA-40,"Korg CA-40 is advertised as having a range capable of tuning an entire piano keyboard - A0 to C8. It cannot and I've tried it on 5 different pianos. It doesn't pick up the bottom octave and a half nor the top two octaves. It just stops responding. When you're in the center of the keyboard, it works good and the display is easy to read but being that it's advertised range is not even close to actual, I am forced to give it a low review score."
4,Works great for my tenor sax,"This tuner is great and easy to use. It is by far the best I have seen. The only bad thing is the shape of the back...if you are tuning someone else, it is hard to hold, and is a bit slippery. Other than that, it's the best."
2,better then a pitchpipe for sure,I was going to get a pitch pipe and then saw this so i cancled my pitchpipe order and got this with 1 day shipping got here on time...but it needs to be set at 440mhz for a violin..I spent a hr tuning my violin not only for the first time but also touching a violin for the first time in like 10 years.well i though it was good but have to re review my review this thing sucks I found out my violin software had a violin tuner on it..it's more accurate then this tuner when im at A on the software tuner it's on B and this tuner so its not right plus it's really frickin touchy if a flea farts near it it would go off...waste foe $12 + $3.99 for over night shipping..
1,Hate It,"I am a beginning autoharp player and this tuner comes with just the basics of instructions - assuming that you understand everything. I have no idea what the calibration modes do, how to use them or how to adjust for another instrument. A little basics would be helopful for a beginner."
1,For the Perfectionist,My fault here I am not a musican and I had no idea what to do with this once I got it? You need to have a be a teacher in music to use this.
1,Makes a better paper weight,This tuner is not very good for bass. It is constantly a few cents off. At first it seemed fine but after a few months use I don't know. My intonation may be off but with this tuner I cannot set it. I have a Korg rackmount tuner and it is superb. This is low quality. May be fine with guitars. Wish I would have saved my money and got a better tuner. Now the return period is up so I am stuck with it.
5,Black American Soldiers Civil War - WWII,This book is great. This book allows one to peer into the harsh life of black soldiers. I was shocked how many on the WWII black soldier who re-enlisted had to give up their military rack just to fight in the war. I commend Mr. Nalty for telling the story of the Black Soldiers.
5,Wonderful,"The Father of her Child is an very well written, engaging romance. The relationship between Michael and Lauren is believable and sweet. There are very few of the typical tropes generally present in a Harlequin- the relationship is refreshingly honest. The only really unbelievable plot point is the manner in which the abusive ex is dealt with- but even that was fun and explainable in the context of the book."
4,Lots of fun,"I really enjoyed reading a category romance that didn't quite fit the category. You know that really downbeat moment that comes about 80 per cent of the way through almost all category romances? This one didn't have it, but it DID have a smashing (literally) scene instead."
4,Do you want to sell this album??,"Sweet Amazon, how we love you! But you MUST put the composers' names with their works!! How else can anyone tell who composed this particular ""Symphony No. 1"", for instance. In the meanwhile, let me say how I appreciate your new product. What a wonderful idea! Spiff it up, and then, Good Job!!"
4,What do I do with the insert while cleaning the cup?,"My daughter got this sippy cup from her best friend for Valentine's Day. They are both 2 and he had a great time coloring the insert and adding stickers. My daughter loves it and it is a great (BPA-free) cup. It doesn't leak or have any other issues. The only thing I have a hard time with, is keeping the custom insert from getting messed up when the cup is in the dishwasher. Plan on having the paper insert sitting around while the cup is getting cleaned. Also, it does get a bit more crumpled on the edges each time we put the cup back together. Otherwise, a fun and functional cup! :-)"
4,Great Product,Product arrived promptly and in good shape. I did not give 5 stars as I felt the shipping charge was excessive.
5,great cup/concept,I love Playtex cups in general. I wanted this particular one b/c my son has severe food allergies and it makes it easier to distinguish his cup in daycare from the other kids'. I wish it were more readily available!
4,Great product and hard to find,I was so happy to find this product online as it is no longer availabale at my beauty supply store.
4,sharing,"The entire work of Joyce has the same caracteristic of ""finnegans wake"" it begins where it ends. No one understood it as Motherwell did. The most amazing thing is that he translated his understanding of joyce's world not by verbal ways but by visual ways - drawing. In the Dedalus sketchboks we found these wonderful drawings showing the Joycian's characters as true as they were built by their autor. And still those drawings are not illustrations. Their are very particular. I can say ,with no doubt, that they are witnesses of a meeting played by two great artists. Both man tried to share with us their views of something , I believe that this something is the human experience. If you believe what I said is true them Motherwell has been well succeded in sharing with us his own experience in Joyce's work."
2,Not what you think.....,"If you are expecting good copies of some of their classic hits, you need to go elsewhere. If you are a real fan of the band, some of the unreleased recordings and orignal recordings are worth the listen. A precursor to their Sire recordings which showed that the group still desire to stretch and grow when not laden with redoing old hits."
1,The Very Worst of Price Guides,"This is exactly what I said in my review of the baseball price guide: ""I'll make this short and sweet. I thought this book would be helpful when going to sportscard shows. I felt I wouldn't have to carry a big book around. But this book is so superficial you are better off just taking the Monthly or Beckett Plus Price Guides. DO NOT waste your money on this book. I returned it to Amazon."""
4,Smaller then I thought it would be,The description is a bit vague for my taste. When I got it I was expecting a larger oven. 10 means in diameter and it holds 6 quarts which is on the smaller size for dutch ovens. Good size for cobblers and possibly meats. Good product and nice because it comes with a lid lifter for free. I really like the Commemerative lid which can also be used as a skillet. Nice feature.
3,Pros and cons,"Pros: good price for the size, I like the lid feature which enables one to use the lid as a skillet, and the National Park design is nice. Also includes a small channel for a thermometer cable. Cons: as other reviewers have noted, the coating on the piece from the factory smells terrible- I am working to re-season it now, and the finish is very rough/course compared with other Lodge pieces I have had; it will take several coats of seasoning to improve this. But mine did not have finish flaws/bubbles/chips as others have reported. I was torn about paying more for a made in the USA Lodge without the lid skillet, or less for this, and even now that I have received it I am not certain I made the right choice. If you are more concerned with price, this is not bad, but if made in the USA matters to you more (as if sometime does to me), I am not sure I'd recommend this one."
5,Best thing ever,My neighbor told me about dutch oven cooking and I bought this one and was amazed at the flavor of everything you cook in it. I've been using it every other day. I even use the skillet lid to cook my breakfast. Well worth the money and it's in great shape.
5,Great item.,Great dutch oven and good service. We've already used it several times. A nice addition to our collection of outdoor cook ware.
2,Past his prime,"Van Cliburn was undeniably a unique artist, who made many excellent recordings in the late 50's - early 60's. He then suffered what appears to be a nervous breakdown and pretty much lost his capacity to make worthwhile music. This 1972 recording falls into the later category. For the Brahms look to Fleisher/Szell, Gilels/Reiner, Richter/Leinsdorf, Serkin/Szell, Anda/Klemperer or a handful of others depending on your taste. For the Rhapsody look to Rubinstein/Reiner, Wild/Horenstein or Katchen/Boult. All of these are head and shoulders above this recording by Cliburn. For a good example of Cliburn at his peak, try the disc containing Tchaikovsky No.1 and Rachmaninov No.2 with Kondrashin and Reiner on RCA Living Stereo."
2,Not enjoyable.,"I give this 2 stars because it's not completely worthless, not completely devoid of musical appeal. But let us be frank, any piano performance graduate could play in same fashion, and many would do this better.There is very little ""music"" I hear in this recording, but much brash, ponderous and near methodical banging. Everything is heavy and slow, nothing is sparkling or melodic. This is not a good interpretation of either piece - both requiring long sustained melodic lines. His playing might have been better suited to Prokovief..."
1,Who's that banging on the piano?,"Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody has to be one of my personal top ten favorite musical works, but I can't bear to listen to this recording of it. Cliburn plays like he has a 16-pound sledgehammer in each hand. I forced myself to listen to it a second time, thinking something must have thrown off my judgement, but Cliburn's playing actually made me wince. Several times. Kondrashin and the Moscow Philharmonic turn in a very martial-like accompanyment, presumably to justify their esteemed guest's interpretation, but it's still all a dreadful experience.Nothing can justify Cliburn's similar approach to the Brahms. Or make me want to hear it again, for that matter."
3,overemotional and yet painfully repressed,"Bernstein got it totally wrong here in my view. The tempo is at times too slow or too intensely infused with emotion which makes the music sound repressed throughout. This can make the sanest person feel almost claustrophobic. So, this is just bad. Those who like this must be blind admirers of Bernstein who was of course a great conductor although this time he got it all wrong. There is nothing more to say here except sorry to those who get upset with me for telling the truth..I recommend Karajan instead for symphony no. 1,2 and 3, Kleiber for no. 4, and Bruno Walter for no. 2 and 3."
4,General Overview of Abstract Analysis,"I recommend this book as a supplement or for independent study in a broad overview of abstract analysis. That's why I gave this book four stars instead of five because I feel that it needs to narrow its selection of topics. Overall, it's a very good book."
2,Meh,This is an okay physics book although it's not terribly useful / interesting in my opinion. Stick with a real textbook and the problems it comes with.
3,Excellant commentary but get a magnifying glass,"The commentary is very good. The author shows different approaches to solve physics problems and which approach is better (and why). What is the downside? You will see an equation with a smaller font size. There is an inconsistency in how the smaller font size is applied. The commentary may be a page long with several equations. Usually one equation has the smaller font size. It appears to decrease to a #8 font. It does not stop there. Some of the labeling of the drawing is smaller. Looks like #6. This type of activity would not endear you to the TA or Prof. as they grade your exams. Hopefully, the next edition comes enclosed with a magnifying glass."
3,He explains the principles clearly but,"At times the font size for an equation appears to be about the half the font size of the other equations on the page. This happens sporadically in the book. Also, some of the labeling of the diagrams have an even SMALLER font size. This is annoying. Very annoying when you end up looking at the equation several times. The irony is that I took this physics course while I was in the navy via correspondence. The above was on the syllabus of thing not to do! In the end I can say this book helped me pass the course with a ""B"". He does show you how to approach a problem different ways. And the tests he has on the book ... excellent."
3,Missing a Topic?,"This book was great. Elby's explanations of physics are uncomparable with textbooks'. However, I was really surprised at the fact that a whole topic was omitted from both volumes of his book. He seemed to have omitted ""THERMODYNAMICS,"" a hardcore topic of physics. I thought that was unbelievable, but hey what can I say? Only 1/3 of my upcoming physics final will be on THERMODYNAMICS. Blah!"
4,Reclaim Your Time,"This book is great for someone who is stressed out because they are always so busy dealing with the urgent that they find themself forgetting the important. While many books on time management are great for motivation - this one brings time management tips to you in a practical manner - with questions for reflection and application at the end of each chapter.There were two sections of this book that I found particularly helpful. One dealt with the difference between being efficient - and being effective. Before reading this, I had never realized that a person could show 100% efficiency in something but never have it be effective in helping anyone! The second section that helped me was a list of 7 tips and ways to say no. One of the most helpful tips was to learn to ""go with your gifts"" when making the choice between two good things.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn to reclaim their time."
2,Poor detective novel but interesting Japanese culture.,"This book was poorly written in the sense that the conversations just didn't make sense. Immediately upon meeting a character, Rei would ask them - ""who do you think is the killer? do you think it is your boss"" etc. If you read this book, you will understand how unrealistic the main character is as an investigator. Also, the dialogue is stilted. Sometimes there is a use of informal contractions, but in the same conversation, characters will switch back and forth from formal language. However, this book is a very interesting description of modern Japanese culture and may be worth reading for this aspect alone. Unfortunately, I became impatient with the way this book was written overall, and could not get past the first half. Perhaps the author should simply write nonfiction accounts of Japanese life."
4,The Floating Girl,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Her characters are so interesting and she has you experiencing living in Japan today. I've purchased other novels by this author since finishing Floating Girl.
2,Rei was a turnoff for me,"I haven't read any of the previous books, and when I opened this one, I liked a Japan I could recognise; but the style became really tiresome by the time I was halfway through the book. Who cares for a litany of brand names after a while? The story would have worked equally well without them.And I was pretty put off by a Rei Shimura who made incredible leaps of 'intuition'. Japan's full of people. Why should any particular passerby be the people she's looking for?It's a mystery. There are bound to be wrong conclusions and red herrings along the way. But with the way Rei makes her conclusions, I couldn't even respect her as a detective.All in all, disappointing. Perhaps Massey's earlier, and later work's better."
3,My least favorite of the series,"I really love this series by Sujata Massey. However, this book was my least favorite of the bunch. I still give it three stars because it's NOT BAD...but her other books are so much better, especially The Bride's Kimono, Zen Attitude and The Flower Master. I'm looking forward to reading The Typhoon Lover.For die hard Rei Shimura fans, of course you should get this to make your collection complete, but I'm just warning you I felt this was not as engaging as the other books in this series. For those of you who want only the best, perhaps you should skip this one."
2,Doesn't live up to Salaryman's Wife,"After reading The Salaryman's Wife, I was excited to have discovered a new, unique mystery writer. Unfortunately, The Floating Girl doesn't come close, and makes me think that the author's first novel will end up being her best work. I felt that the story was clumsy, simple, and severely lacking in suspense. I never felt attached to the magic of anime or most of the characters, and the ending was anticlimactic at best."
5,Polar M61 Heart Rate Monitor Watch,I can't think of anything that I don't like about the watch. It does what I was looking for; telling me what my HR is while exercising and giving me an average HR per workout session. You can manually set a range that you want your HR to be in between or it can automatically come up with one for you (it will alert you if you go above or fall below these limits). The transmitter fits comfortably and is easy to put on and take off. Well worth the investment.
5,Polar M61 --super good deal for beginners!,I bought it for $75 and has been great for running and swimming. The only thing I wish it had is a way to read your heart rate in percentages.
1,DROWNING - do not drown your money on this one,"The very first time I used this product in the pool it was filled up with water. It is supposed to be water proof to 3 atm and it proved wrong.I tried to claim the ""international warranty"" and haven't received a response, though local dealer believes they will claim misusage (like I had not read the directions before use). Such a poor service on that end too.AISoto - Queretaro, Mexico."
3,First HRM Watch,"I've exercised with it five times now, and I'm pleased with the stats it reports. The design is quirky and bulky, and the exercise button is easily activated by accident. The manual is not intuitive at all, but I patiently read through it and eventually made sense of it.I like the looks and ergonomics of my last Timex IronMan watch much better, plus it kept 50 stop watch entries in memory (and the watch only cost $40), but that band came apart around the buttons (poor design) which I could not repair, so I upgraded to a HRM watch - choosing Polar. Polar should seriously thin the watch design. I wear it daily to work in the office, and it's too bulky. I'd also like to gave more than one exercise session stats saved at a time."
4,Polar M61 Heart Rate Monitor,"I've been using the Polar M61 in my runs 2-3 times a week for two months now. The watch is very sensitive and picks up changes in heart rate almost instantly. The band is quite comfortable. I usually forget that it's there minutes after I put it on, but I do have friends that said they had to wear body glide to prevent chafing. Overall, the Polar M61 feels like a very well-made piece of equipment.Sometimes I forget to moisten the band before heading out. It's usually not a problem for me as a runner because I usually start perspiring almost immediately.One thing I wish this particular model had is the ability to calculate split time. If I had done a little more research to find out that it doesn't, I probably would have gone with a different model. I do, however, like the more subdued and compact look of this one compared to some of the other models."
3,"fragile, easy to accidentally reset if you bump it","-At first I found this quite useful, the ""test"" feature does appear to measure fitness level change. I have used it at the gym and for cycling. The most used features have been the file and the range alarm.-DO NOT DROP IT ON A HARD SURFACE. It is not a Casio or Timex, it does no handle bumps and drops well, usually resetting it. The last drop finished it off.-It is annoying that the chest strap battery is sealed in and not user serviceable."
5,Simply a wonderful product!!,"This monitor is everything I thought it would be and more! This was my first monitor so I didn't have anything to compare it to, but for over two years I have gotten full bang for my buck. Every feature works great and up to expectations. OwnZone, OwnIndex and the fitness test all perform flawlessly. The fitness test is especially valuable to let a person know how their aerobic capacity is changing as he/she gets stronger. I have also put this watch through a fair amount of abuse and its still going strong. I'm sure there are watches out there with more features, but I love everything about the M61 and I would buy another one in a heartbeat! I even change the batteries myself, although I dont recommend this for everyone. All that and it even keeps good time! Can be had for $[...] on Amazon.com. I paid way more than that and I still consider it a steal. You want to spend $[...]+, be my guest, but for my money the M61 is way more than a basic monitor at a very basic price."
3,Expected to be better,"Considering the original price for this heart rate monitor, I thought that it would give me more information than it does. I have had this monitor for a month now, but I am still learning how to use it. What I don't like is that it doesn't show you your target zones and how long you have been working out in them. It just kind of gives you how long you were in the ZONE but that's not what I need. In general, it picks up heart beat great, counts the calories according to your height and weight. The whole Ownzone is not very helpful to me."
5,Delightful !!,"What a delightful film. My grandchildren love it. It is entertaining as well as educational. For cognitive development everyone should be able to speak and understand a foreign language, at least at a basic level, and for our country Spanish is the one most likely to be used. This DVD is a pleasing and fun way for young children to learn basic Spanish vocabulary."
1,Incorrect Spanish used,"We just finished watching it and I was very disappointed. There were several instances of incorrect Spanish, misspellings (one example: quatro instead of cuatro) and the speaking parts weren't even done by a native Spanish speaker. Also, both my 5 and 8-year old did not like it even though the packaging said for ages 3-8. There are so many other options out there. I would not recommend this one at all. (Background: preschool Spanish teacher, BA in Spanish)"
5,67mm Cokin Adapter,Works as advertised. Well made and arrived undamaged.Packaging was vaccume packed and strange to open. Cokin products appear to be well made.
3,"Wide Ranging, Broad Overviews","As the title suggests this is a wide ranging book which touches on a lot of areas of gardening. I approached it from a container/patio gardening background and found that there was only a small section devoted to that unfortunately. But, it did produce some interesting tips like using spent tea bags or broken plastic nursery pots when providing drainage at the bottom of pots instead of the traditional shards of pottery. There were also interesting sections on water gardening which I'm going to delve into in the spring. The rest dealt with larger gardens proper, including lawn care, animal/pest control, plant care, concrete/brickwork etc. Similar in scope to the previously reviews Virgin Gardener by Edwards, it is a more compact and transportable read. I'll use it as a reference when I graduate beyond the confines of my patio."
5,Turn Right At the Fountain.,"My wife and I, and our friends, have been using this book as our ""European Bible"" for many years. It's like having your own personal tour guide with you. You are in the right place at the right time of day. All of the major sights are included, plus many others that are off the beaten path, but well worth while. The phrase ""Don't leave home without it!"" is certainly applicable here."
4,"Wondeerful collection, one caveat","I have nothing to add to the rave reviews above (below?) -- I too grew up with Fiedler, and wish there were someone like him today making classical music accessible and fun for all ages.If I'd been doing the selecting, however, I'd have dropped most of the George M. Cohan medleys and added more Leroy Anderson -- ""Christmas Festival Overture"", ""Fiddle Faddle"", ""Clarinet Candy"", ""Blue Tango"", all those wonderful light, inventive pieces the Boston Pops made famous. Anderson is one of our great underrated American composers."
4,Good Buy!,"This product keeps the skin fairly moist and the price is very reasonable. I am not sure of the amount of Q10 in this product, as I did not notice a dramatic decrease in wrinkles after half the jar is gone. I may purchase this product again to give it more time."
2,Not for acne prone skin,"Do not use if you have acne prone skin. I ended up with a massive breakouts everywhere the Eucerin cream was used.To test if it was this product causing the breakouts I switched out this Eucerin wrinkle cream for another moisturizer and maintained the same routine for two weeks (the acne cleared up and was no more than usual). I then switched back to the Eucerin cream while maintaining the same facial routine as before and, within a week, my face broke out terribly again.This Eucerin cream might be a good product for wrinkles but not for those with acne prone skin."
4,One of the best wrinkle creams,Like all of us~I have used many wrinkle creams. I found this one to be one of the better ones. I was given a jar to try and loved it. It is difficult to find but Amazon came through.
1,LIES LIES LIES,"The description on box says NON-COMEDOGENIC! That is a LIE!I used this product on one side of my face for a few days! The comedones appeared on ONLY that side! Then I stopped. The comedones went away. Then I tied again, on only one side of my face! The comedones came back after a week.....I accept that that the fine wrinkles were very slightly diminished, but the announced 'sensitivity' advertisements about not making irritations or comedones is complete LIES! THROW THIS 60 dollar Product back at the seller rather than use it!"
5,Gorgeous color imagery from Mexico,"This book shares the light, color, and poetry of Mexico with its readers. The photographer's passion for his subjects comes through with every photo. It is also an interesting view into the unique Mexican history of fiestas; the context of the traditions within daily life is very intriguing. I would highly recommend this book to those interested in either Mexico or color photography. It is a beautiful and sensitive work."
5,Norma's Regret?,One interesting part of the book is the question whether Norma still had one big regret in life which was not getting married when she had the chance. The decisions one makes in life??
4,Camping in the Carolinas,"Johnny Molloy had a dream assignment; to explore the campgrounds of North and South Carolina with his tent, vehicle and laptop. He came back with 55 campgrounds and created ""a guide for car campers who hate RVs, concrete slabs, and loud portable stereos"". The author writes with such enthusiasm and asks ""have you ever been to the Outer Banks in fall, with a cool breeze and ward golden light spilling onto its sands?"" He briefly discusses the area's history. Each campground is rated for beauty, noise, privacy, security, spaciousness, and cleanliness. He also talks about the active outdoor possibilities such as hiking, biking, canoeing or fishing in or close to the campground. A great guide to have for camping close to home"
1,Never Again For This Skillet,"If I could give no stars for this, I would. I've been using electric skillets for more years then I care to say. I love cooking with them and when my last one simply wore out from so much use, I bought this one. What a mistake. After only minimal use, the middle of the pan began to burn extra hot and all the food was sticking and burning. Then the coating began to peel from the pan. The middle began to buldge slightly so the surface was not flat for even frying. What a nightmare!! This pan was less then two months old! And I do know how to treat and cook with electric skillets - just in case you were thinking I did something to cause this. I have never been so disappointed in a product before. However, it did have a new place in our home - the trash can. Guess I should have read the reviews first. Now that was my mistake!!!"
1,Rival Skillet,"I bought this skillet in March,2006. It worked great at first. It was such a breeze to clean. Last week I was making dinner in it and it completely shut off. Apparantly the motor burned up or something. Because I bought it on line I can not take it back to the store. If I want anything done I have to send it back to Rival in California and prepay all shipping charges plus handleing charges. Which they don't even say how much to send for this. I am very dissappointed with the whole thing and will think twice about ordering online again."
1,Broke after 3rd time,"This was a Christmas presant for my wife. She used it 2 times after Christmas and it broke. After contacting Rival, they don't even showed as selling this model."
1,non stick nighmare,"this review if for the model S16G, but i bet that the non stick finish is the same.i grew up with a mom and two aunts who had these and used them succesfully for years, cooking great, and sometimes not so great meals. when i started to acquire appliances for the kitchen, i asked them what brand they had, and all of them said rival. i bought the S16G to make french onion soup, turkey stuffing, and bacon and egg breakfasts. after using the product the second time, the non stick finish just deteriorated, causing everything to stick to the area over the heating element. for a brand new appliance, it looks like its been through the ringer. i am going to toss it, and my $50 away. I DO NOT RECOMMEND."
1,Rival S16SG 12 by 16-Inch Skillet,I would rate this a -5 if I could. Nonstick started coming off right away. Difficult to change heat setting. Turns off while cooking. Quick heating altogether. DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING VERY DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. I have a 20 year old Proctor-Silex I paid under 20 dollars for and everything still works....
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this skillet and at first, it was a dream. Unfortunately, I did not see the review about the improper heating of the pan. I too, experienced the middle of the pan becoming discolored and sticking. It is impossible to clean this area. I threw away my money on this product. DO NOT BUY."
1,Wonderful while it worked!,"I bought this in April, 2006 and I'm afraid I have to add my voice to the others who say the very same thing...it just stopped working 2 months later! I absolutely LOVE this skillet and am VERY disappointed! Why are there no options for returning an obviously defective product to Amazon?! Hopefully, this will serve as warning to others who are considering this purchase."
2,hard to control temp,"it is well made and a nice weight but the controls are very hard to setif your bring somthing up to brown the only way to turn down the temp is to shut if off you can dial down the temp but it will turn it back up and try to burn your dish,and the lowest settings are too high for a slow simmer if i had a choice id rather have infinite control with a knobI still use my old skillet for most things but this looks good in my kitchen"
1,Not recommended,"The digital readout kept giving an error message. Even after following the instructions of turning the unit off and letting it adjust to the ambient temperature before turning it back on, the message reappeared at about 250 degrees."
1,"Non Stick, my foot","We got this skillet last summer, and we seasoned it just like the instructions called for. The very first time we used it, food stuck to it. As a matter of fact, it stuck every time we used it. It stuck worse than the five year old Presto we were replacing, so we went back to the Presto. This is the worst and cheapest non stick finish we have ever run across. The digital temperature control would have been nice, if it hadn't been for the terrible finish."
2,skillet,"This product is very delicate and the controls break off easily. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The controls, if the don't break, don't work properly after a while."
1,DO NOT BUY THE RIVAL S16SG! YOU WILL BE SORRY!!,"This item is very large and was great in the beginning. Once I used it, maybe, 10 times the coating began to bubble and then peel off onto my food!This item IS NOT WORTH BUYING!"
1,UNNECESSARY RESURRECTION,"Purportedly based on a short story by DRACULA scribe Bram Stoker, WAY OF THE VAMPIRE is a ridiculous, poorly directed and acted, waste of celluloid. Van Helsing (a stoic but bland Rhett Giles) is cursed with eternal life until all the darkest princes are destroyed. After a beheading of Dracula (a cameo by action star Paul Logan), Van Helsing lives through time until we meet up with him in present day Los Angeles. Vampires are a pitiful lot now, unable to hunt due to the curse of being caught and destroyed. However, led on by their leader Sebastian, they return to the hunt. Meanwhile Van Helsing assembled a motley crew of vampire slayers and the confrontation begins. The movie is hopelessly dull and offers no genuine thrills or chills. Another movie that gives support to the overkill of the Dracula legend, and proof that a truly original vampire movie or at least a refreshing update is hard to find."
2,Van Helsing is Immortal,I happen to catch this movie on Chiller last nite. Apparently Scifi(SyFy)has push some of their movies to Chiller. This movie had a good ideal. Having Van Helsing fight off vampire in Modern Day LA. I sorry I can't vampire are scared to feed because of Van Helsing. S**t it didn't stop the vampires in Blade. He's is half vamp. Helsing didn't have has strength or speed. Why didn't this vamps buy a blood bank or get the homeless. In LA there is plenty to live off. They won't be missed. That part really piss me off. The main villian didn't have any real plans. There is black vamp chick. She was always yeahing and dude was like yo. I just want some booty. I don't what was worse the vamps crew or vamp helsing crew. You just wanted both of them to died. Please somethign bite n stake these actors. I can say that Van Helsing crew is a bit more organize. It's a fun bit laugh at. But don't buy or rent this movie. If your interested in seeing that bad. Watch on Syfy or Chiller.
1,I couldn't even finish half of it,"It was horrible... I couldn't even sit through half of it. I started watching it, then tried watching it on fast forward and still had to turn it off."
3,Prequel to DRACULAS CURSE ?,"Bram Stoker's WAY OF THE VAMPIREWith Rhett Giles, Denise Boutte.Theasylum.ccLots of atmosphere in this little pic that could, Think its only 3 years before The Next Wave.Rhett Giles took this role and perfected in `Draculas Curse'.Denise Boutte steals EVERY scene she is in as Vampiress and truly came into her own in `DEATH VALLEY : Revenge Of Bloody Bill'.Vampire and hero have a connected past and both are immortal, Until modern times reunite them.Soundtrack is by SCORPIONS Ralph Rieckermann, And it sets the tone for a film that tries really hard to give the viewer a feeling of gothic vibe at choice times."
5,The Odyssey,"If you want to read a good book then The Odyssey is a book for you. I finished reading the book today. It was adventures and romantic.I liked the part when the Scylla's six heads ate the goat.Odysseus (The King Of Ithica) trys to get back to his lovely wife and has to go threw alot of dangeruos adventures but will he ever make it well, to knowe you have to read the book.I recomend you to read this book trust me you'll get a kick out of it.So go out and buy this book today you'll be happy that you got it. Oh and one more thing once you start reading it you would never want to put the book down."
5,The Odyssey,"THE ODYSSEY IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE.IT HAS EVERY THING FROM ACTION TO ROMANCE.THERE IS MANY MORALS THAT YOU CAN LEARN FROM THE ODYSSEY.ODYSSEUS THE MAIN HERO IN THE STORY IS REALLY COCKY BUT MATURES INTO A MAN WHO STRIVES TO SEE HIS FAMLY AND KINGDOM.TELEMACHUS IS TRYING TO FIND HIS FATHER BUT FAILS.BUT SUPRISINGLY HE SHOWS UP AND ALL IS WELL.MAYBE SO.IF YOU WANT A STORY WITH ACTION,ROMANE AND ALOT OF OTHER GOOD THNGS READ THE ODYSSEUS, YOU WILL LOVE YOURSELF FOR READING IT."
3,My Opinion of The Odyssey,"I'd have to say that this book was a good book because it gives you almost every kind of novels.It gives too much so the book gives little part on one thing like the action, the romance, and the others. I would suggest that your age should be about 11 to read this book.The story was about a man named Odysseus wandering around the world longing for his home and its up to you to find out what happens in his voyage by reading The Odyssey."
5,Odyssey Review,"I think the Odyssey is a real great book.I think it showesa valuable lesson of ages, about 2,000 years ago.The Odyssey inspired me to be strong, and to never give up on anything in the world.The first time I saw the cover I thought to myself, this is going to a boring book to read.One thing that was wrong was that I judge a book by its cover.When you read this book you should get the movie to read and watch as you go further in the book, so remember to read this book because it real amazing I think that you will like it alot. This book will have your kid or relitives want to read.THE ODYSSEY is one of the best booksive ever read in the whole world."
5,One of the best retellings of Homer's Odessy,I have read many version of the Odessy. This one IS THE EASIEST TO UNDERSTAND.
5,Good tool in services,This book is a wonderful aid for the offering time. It gives a non confrontational way to address the topic of stewardship each week during the offering. There are about 50 short stories that are tasteful and Biblically sound that illustrate how are giving ought to be.
1,"Looks good, works poorly","The shower head looks glossy and nice, but fails at its only function - providing a good pressure shower. Even though the head is big, it produces a weak, flaccid spray, that is worse than the 10 year old shower head I was replacing. The construction does not look very sturdy, and the brass polish appears to come off easily if using any tools to tighten (make sure to cover with cloth before applying any tools).Disappointing! I am in the process of returning the item now."
2,Uncomfortable.,"The bead's paint job? Not sure what to call it, but.. it immediately starts to chip off as you wear the ring, causing painful stabbing with the sharp edges. I ended up taking it out after a week. :/"
1,Embarrassment,"I am usually a fan of Mr. Hansen's work. But, this book is a product of intellectual laziness and should never have been published. If Sherman were alive today he would be on trial for war crimes. Patton was a competent commander in a sea of incompetence. Patton never fought in a battle where he did not enjoy numerical, supply, and complete air superiority. He never had to rise up to meet a foe as an underdog. Patton fought in battles that were largely mopping up operations against inferior foes. The cult of Patton does not make sense when his efforts are examined empirically.Trying to attach noble attributes to a war criminal and grandstanding personal promoter are laughable. Working for money is a necessity, but I did not expect Mr. Hansen to use his name for easy profit."
2,A Travesty,"Lionising Sherman while dismissing Grant as a plodding General is laughable.I am far from being a knowledgeable military historian but even I know the reason Sherman's March was so successful was because George H. Thomas destroyed Hood's army at Nashville, leaving him no effective resistance in his front.It was Grant who destroyed a CSA army at Chattanooga and captured two others at Donelson and Vicksburg and was the one man in the Union Army to consistently win victory after victory by sheer determination and will.The March was an excellent logistical triumph but Hanson's chapter on Sherman could be dismissed by a high-school student.For a real look at who was responsible for the Union's triumph read John Keegan's essay on Grant in The Face of Battle."
2,The Soul of Battle,"Reviewer Kelly J. Snowden has it right. This book is based on a terrific premise and would have been a 150 page best-seller. Unfortunately, Hanson wrote more than 400 pages, setting a new standard in tautology."
1,IDEOLOGICAL TWADDLE,"I expected biography and military analysis; it's Victor's personal opinion of 3 military leaders, filtered through his PC ideology. In fact, he doesnt like the military at all. What he likes are unwashed armed mobs who prevail over people who bathe.He has few kind words for the great military leaders of history.This is the sort of twaddle pedagogues cobble together today."
2,sort of interesting,"I saw a bit of an interview with the author on Book TV and got this. I really WANTED to like this book. The (stated) premise of the book is strong, and bringing Epaminondas's exploits to a wide audience seemed pretty interesting to me.My problem was that right from the get-go it seemed to me the author had a pretty weird tendency to draw political parallels between ancient Greece and today which just aren't appropriate or realistic. They weren't key to what he was trying to say, either, so I probably could have soldiered through the book. I put it down, though, since it was distracting trying to figure out where he was really coming from.I admit that his dismissiveness toward Alexander and Grant seemed borderline childish to me, the way it was written. Perhaps that also made it hard for me to take the good parts of the book seriously."
2,SShopper,"Advertised as intermediate/advanced, I would say this is more intermediate, maybe on the lower side. I'm not in the best shape, but this was really easy and I didn't break a sweat. Maybe it was just too short - video is about 25 mins actual running time. Plus side - can be done in small spaces and can be an easy wake-up routine that wont disgruntle you too much in the AM."
4,UN LIBRO PARA ALGUIEN ESPECIAL,"Para esos momentos tan dificiles pero felices, este libro te ayudará a tener un parto feliz, ya que te sacará de todas las dudas que tengas durante tu embarazo. TE SERA DE UTILIDAD.."
1,Demasiado simple,"Este librito parece escrito para el futuro bebe mas que para los padres, no solo por el estilo sencillo sino sobre todo por los contenidos (basicos y simplificados). Solo lo recomendaria a alguien que quisiera dedicar el menor tiempo posible a aprender las cuestiones mas basicas de la concepcion, el embarazo y el parto. Quien desee tener mas informacion hara bien en adquirir otro libro mas completo como, por poner un ejemplo en el otro extremo, el famoso ""Que se puede esperar cuando se esta esperando"". Finalmente, me parece caro para lo que se puede encontrar en su interior, mas aun cuando de sus 125 paginitas, 25 forman un calendario en blanco (a rellenar por la madre, se supone...)."
5,"Me acompañé, me resolvió todas mis dudas en","mis dos embarazos...Y deveras que tanto el embarazo como el parto fue felicísimo.Las mujeres embarazadas requerimos todo el cariño, la tranquilidad y el conocimiento que nos puede dar este extraordinario libro...Por mucho que sepamos, aqui aprendemos más y más cada vez..porque todos los embarazos son diferentes,¿no es cierto, amigas?"
1,Not easy to use,We have 2 older feeders that is the same style and we love them. Easy to clean and simple to use. Attracts allot of hummingbirds.We purchased 4 more and found out the top is almost impossible to put on. It's just too tight. I'm very disappointed.
3,"Beautiful Design, But RUSTS, Guilty of Buying a Second One!","I purchased my first Birdscapes Hummingbird feeder about 8 months ago, due to the design. It looks classic, and high-quality, compared to the other cheap plastic looking ones. After about 5 months, I noticed that the flowers faded from the sun and cracked and rusted, and the small metal rings on the inside of the flowers have severely rusted. My hummingbird feeder lives under a slatted porch roof so is partially protected from the elements. The rest of the feeder still looks great, but the birds have stopped coming :( The birds are clearly requesting a new feeder. I just order another one, because design is the most important thing, and I just couldn't bare to look at a cheap piece of neon red plastic hanging outside my living room window. I hope the company figures out that the parts are rusting and take care of the problem. I am disappointing that I have to buy another product due to their inability to make a product that lasts."
4,Just received - and it's pretty,"Nice looking feeder, great finish on the top - but wonder if I should somehow shellac it, to keep it from rusting. Glass bottle screws into a plastic coupling - which seems could be trouble, as bottle doesn't line up completely straight. Time will tell..."
5,no more wimpy plastic feeders for me,"This unit is made of REAL metal and REAL glass. The hummingbirds love it and so do I. This fall was the end of the first hummingbird season that I've been able to take the feeder down and clean and store it over the winter. All previous feeders were mostly plastic and mostly useless after one season. I believe this feeder will be around for years, keeping the hummingbirds happy and well-fed."
4,Will make do with rust as it is otherwise excellent,"I've used these feeders for at least five years. The hummers love them, and like to rest on the perch. It is sturdy and looks attractive, with the copper colored top and bottom. Unfortunately, the bottom rusts after a year or so. Rather than replacing them at that point, I just scrub the top and bottom with steel wool, and then spray them with a paint meant to cover rust. I then use a small brush to paint the flowers with red enamel. I didn't bother to paint the flowers on one of the feeders, and the hummingbirds still like it. The feeders will last for years now. We can't imagine a summer without the enjoyment of these lovely birds."
4,Forced to give 4 stars due to rust,"I have had this feeder for 2 years, living exposed to the Pacific ocean. It has rusted and therefore is a little unsightly or, if you can excuse the pun...rustic! The red color of the fountain flowers has also faded completely, BUT....the birds still seem to LUUUUUV it and currently spend more time with this one than the Humzinger!If you are ok with cleaning bottles, this is a gr8 feeder.I use it with the Perky Pet powder nectar and I assume this is what attracts the birds since the petals have faded brown."
2,Pretty but started to rust,"This feeder is pretty and decorative. The issue is for the money, I was surprised to see it starting to rust under the top and around the flower area."
4,"Great look, high quality",This is a great feeder. It has a great look (better than red plastic) and it's easy to clean. Definitely a step up from the ordinary hummingbird feeder.
1,Rusting Problems,"Though this feeder looks great, the fasteners that attach the ""flowers"" to hummingbird feeder rust. The hummingbirds drink through the aforementioned fasteners. I do not know if this will discourage hummingbirds in the future, but if I was buying a new feeder, I would not choose this one."
1,Rusty water not healthy for the birds,"After one season, the rust began to form on the metal basin thus poisoning the water. There's no way to clean the rust off. More and more corrosion over time. I don't want to kill the little beauties, just feed them. I bought instead a metal free feeder and have had no trouble."
4,"Rusts, but in a good way.","Yes, it rusts, but I dig that weathered look, and it actually fits well with our rough-hewn naturalistic garden, The flowers have stayed red, that's all the hummers care about looks-wise. I've seen some fake boutiques filled with new ""antiqued"" furniture sanded and hammered to look worn, but this is real shabby-chic.Of the four different hummer feeders I've had it's been the best. It's been easy to clean too, though I sometimes use a bottle brush if there's crud inside.The steel wire cable did wear through after a couple of years, but probably because had hung it on a thicker cable and it was more friction than expected. It went strand by strand, with plenty of warning so you can wrap a little duct tape on it if need be, but I waited too long and it snapped in a wind storm and the ""shatter-proof glass reservoir"" broke.BTW, don't waste your money on fake nectar, it's scam. Just sugar and water, ask Audubon, ABA, Cornell, whoever."
2,Looks nice - But Functionality not quite right,The plastic screw-on bottom and top are not easy to attach to the glass container. I would say it is down right troublesome.I would not purchase this item again due to the problem.
3,Hummingbird feeder a disappointment,"I wanted a metal feeder because the squirrels chew the plastic ones. The first problem was that the feeder perch was bent-- crooked. Oh, well. But the second problem was with the way the bottle screws into the base. The inner parts are plastic, and it is the bottle that tightens the two sections of the base as it screws in. It was hard to get it to screw in correctly. If it isn't exact, it won't hold together. I kept it, but I was not really happy with it."
2,Several problems with this feeder:,"This feeder is NOT more durable due to metal parts as some reviews state. None of the 'working parts' are made of metal; the parts that screw together are the usual cheap plastic that eventually cracks. Although the bottom reservoir comes apart for cleaning, it's very difficult to clean the glass tube. If you live in a windy desert (where Hummingbirds live) the feeder will tip in the wind and empty out. If the wind never blows at your house, you'll be fine. I have several feeders and they don't seem to be designed by engineers..."
5,best feeder I have used,this feeder was bought to replace one that had been damaged by a storm. The old one was 3 years old and had worked better that the others we have had. The feeder will rust but the birds don't mind. It could always be repainted.
1,Messy,"I had a bad experience with this particular Hummingbird feeder. It must be filled upside down then you flip it over to get the metal disc to slide down to create the seal. Unfortunately, a seal is not created, therefore I spilt sticky, red, hummingbird water all over the kitchen floor! This might have been avoided had instructions been included. No such luck. After I cleaned up, refilled & headed outdoors, it still leaked, all over the freshly washed floor! It was okay once it was hung up, until the ants attacked! By that time, I was done. Into the Garage Sale box it went."
1,Rusty,Within four weeks this hummingbird feeder had rust spots on it and the red flowers are faided. Plus I never saw a bird drink from it and I have been feeding humming birds for over 20 years.
3,Good but corrodes and no glass replacement,"I have two and find two problems.1. The metal corrodes when they are outside. One I left as is, the other I sprayed with an industrial lacquer I've used successfully on other outdoor metals. Both corroded; I haven't been able to clean them with any substance.2. I just broke the screw in part of the glass while cleaning it and don't find any replacement source at the vendor."
4,Solid if inessential live album,"While live Smiths was usually awesome to listen to, this album, recorded during the end of the last tour the Smiths ever undertook, while good, isn't essential except to diehard Smiths fans. The performances are good and interesting, but it's not their most inspired performance, although it was one of the better ones from the end of the tour. However, I read somewhere that the band initially wanted it released as a 2CD set to include the whole concert, while Morrissey crypitcally refused and instead compiled this 1CD set that was released. Knowing Morrissey, I guess we'll never know why he did that, as the complete show would have been a treat."
3,I know it's Over,"And you will too when you listen the this CD. Not that it's that bad, it's just a let down, a big let down. The band is sloppy, too fast, and Morrissey vocals are openly over the top playing off on some derivative of his former self. Almost as if he could care less of what is now just all a big joke. Maybe I'm being too rough but that is what it seems like! Clearly the band final days were felt. All songs are inferior to the studio versions. This opposed to Hatful of Hollow which blew the studio versions away in many cases."
3,Good but too short...,"I am on of the biggest Smiths fans there is. And yes, you must get this if you are a fan. But, you can't help but wonder why (especially on cd) why Morrissey (apparently, he decided what songs were to go on this album) skipped out on many great tracks that the Smiths played on this night.Songs like: ""Frankly, Mr. Shankly"" , ""There is a light that never goes out"", ""I want the one I can't have"", ""How soon is now?"" and others were sadly omitted. The overall sound is very good but you can't help but feel like your being swindled here. I hope ""they"" decide to release another live album to make up for ""Rank""."
4,Great selection live,"Hard to believe it's been 20 years since the release of this album, which came out after the band disbanded and just before Morrissey ventured out on his own.This is not a ""must have"" but showcases some of the Smiths' best work (albeit mostly from The Queen is Dead).Recording quality is average."
5,one of the few truly great live rock albums,the smiths only official live album 'rank' is a treasure among live albums.. morrissey's charismatic stage presence and vocal talent obviously seem to steal the show.. but this is a great band effort with some great guitar playing by johnny marr... the song selection covered all their albums up to that time and featured their current single 'ask'.. There is a great excitement to this album.. the band sounds fresh and daring.. it is a shame that they would break up so soon.. but that is the way it goes.. morrissey would go on to what is still proving to be a great solo career..
5,Its one of the best c.d. out there,I got it a month ago and i havnt stoped listing to it sience. Its got everything from ska (less than jake) to hardcore punk (H20). If you are into the punk/ska scene that this cd is a must.
3,HELP,IT FITS OK. NOT AS WELL AS I HAD HOPED IT WOULD FIT. IT TOOK 3 PEOPLE TO GET IT ONTO THE OLD SEATS AND WE HAD TO MAKE SHIFE IT INTO PLACE. I FEEL I WOULD HAVED LOOKED FOR SOMETHING ELSE IF I KNEW WHAT I KNOW NOW.
4,"Easy to use, works very well",The transmitter/monitor watch set works very well and it's accurate. I use it on all my indoors and outdoors training sessions. You definitely need to moist the back of the transmitter for it to pick your heart rate reliably. Can get tricky during outdoors training in cold weather because you may not sweat as much. Use your imagination! :)
2,Not too sure,"I'm not exactly sure if this product works like the way everyone says it does. Either way, it taste very bitter and has a strong odor. Since it doesn't taste that great, put it in tea or soda and you can't tell as much."
4,Great book,"This book is exactly what a lot of parents today need. Stop accepting mediocrity, stop bargaining and pleading with your kids, raise your expectations for them and BE THE PARENT. Start early or you'll regret it. This book is an easy read, short and to the point. It is somewhat simplpistic, but not everything needs to be complicated. It really applies to young children only, not so much for kids over five to six but great for the younger bunch. I have recommended it to patients and friends as a starter on how to discipline their children."
3,personal commentary on the Rule by a lay Benedictine,"De Waal has made a name for herself by adapting Benedict for the laity.This latest of her works is perhaps the least accessible, andit by no means a place to start in getting to know the saint of Monte Cassino. Christianswho already order their lives by drawing from the centuries-old ""Rule,""however, will want to read it cover to cover. She goes through each chapter and gives, not a scholarly but a personalcommentary on its meaning. Many references to other works of Benedictinescholarship. Don't have a copy of the ""Rule"" handy? (You must have one to getanything out of this work at all.) Liturgical Press will send you one free ifyou return the postpaid card that comes with de Waal's book. What a deal!"
4,Gee Bee,"A very informative book about a very special group of airplanes. Clearly building the replica plane (and debunking a few myths about the original) was a labor of love for the authors, and it shows."
5,Gee Bee,"Take an exciting trip back via the replication of The Gee Bee. Relive the nail biting expectations of the Gee Bee design and the myths that were dispelled in the modern version of this 1930's air racing phenomenon. Enjoy the next best way to fly the Gee Bee, short of being in the cockpit."
3,Not Anka's Best....,"Although it's nice to have most of Anka's RCA Victor singles collected on one cd, some of these songs are not really very good at all. Anka can't really blame the British Invasion for his poor chart showings after 1962. Just give a listen to a waste of good vinyl like ""Hello Jim"" or ""At Night"" to see that Anka waxed some real clunkers for RCA. Also, missing from this CD is Anka's pretty good version of ""Goodnight My Love"" from early 1969. On a more positive note, these tracks sound a bit better here than on the old Rhino ""30th Anniversary"" disc from the late 80's. Like the other reviewer said, stick with ""30th Anniversary"" unless you've just GOT to have all of these Victor tracks. One other note: two versions of ""Remember Diana"" appear on this disc; the more familiar single version and an alternate take that I've never heard. The track is listed only once on the CD."
4,Incomplete,"I don't have this one but I know most of the songs. Thanks Heaven RCA didn't include none of the awful re-recordings from the ABC Paramount hits. Two things are left, Goodnight My Love version from which I had once the vynil copy and most of all, an obscure but finest song from RCA as it was ""Sylvia"", I guess it was a B-side. Can anyone tell me where can I find this one? Regards. Raúl"
3,Watch out for the brew basket!,"The only reason this gets such a low rating has to do with the design of the brew basket. The brew basket does not lock properly in place. You must hold it in place as you remove the carafe - or it will swing out! Sure defeats the ""pause & serve"" feature! My work around has been to use the carafe from my previous coffee maker. It is the same height, but does not have such a deep impression in the lid. Therefore, it does not pull the brew basket out as you try to get a cup of coffee. I have 'pause & serve', safety, and a not so new carafe."
1,This is a fire hazard!,"The switch smelled burnt whenever I would turn it on. After only 2 months, the hotplate burned out. This is a fire hazard and should be recalled."
5,Why Aren't These Guys International Megastars?,"Listening to Halo makes me wish I had goen into the music industry so I could help make King Konga a household name.It's all about the rhythm section - King Konga intertwine a unique blend of Carribbean rhythms and Delta Blues that results in their own special sound. The title song Halo takes you to the beach and servess up a shot of tequila. All the songs will have you dancing and grooving. Love it!You will not regret this pirchase and make sure you stick it out on track 6, you will get a bonus at the end!PS - Go see them live when they come to your town, you will be amazed!"
5,Serious little toaster in the Viking style,"Nothing flashy...just solid construction in the typical Viking style: built like a tank, and it looks like it'll still be running in fifty years.Cooks toast and anything else you can stuff into a toaster with complete evenness, even when several items are toasted back to back.Cool exterior and easy to clean, especially with the pull-out crumb drawer."
4,Cadilac Price with Chevy Options,"Looks great, toasts great, and built to last. Definitely bigger than you'd expect. I bought this because I was trying to stay away from all the bells and whistles (LED lights, digital displays, etc.), but I expected the best functions.My gripes: 1) the width of the slots is just adequate to fit traditional bread. If you have a wide loaf, say rye, it won't fit. You have to turn it vertically and flip it halfway through. 2) the slots are thick enough for bagels and such, but they do not adjust (clamp down) for thiner pieces. So if you have a thin slice, it will lean at an angle instead of standing staight up-and-down in the middle. 3) The toast does not sit high enough in the slots. So with the small side of an English muffin, you need to use two hands to get the toast out.Now these are all small things, and I still rated this toaster a 4, but there is no reason why Viking should not have incorporated these basic designs into this premium priced toaster."
3,BIG toaster,"I bought this toaster based on the comments I saw here. One poster said it is built like a tank which seems to be true but they failed to mention that it is the size of one, too. It takes up a lot of room on my counter. I tested it over the weekend and if worked fine. One disappointment is the doneness control. It is very loose which makes me wonder if it will go out later. I don't know if that is the case in all of the toasters or just mine. I bought it a Macy's on sale for $174.99 from their website. The toaster was not available in the Macy stores in my area. I know they give the dimensions to it but I paid no attention to them. I just assumed it would be an ordinary sized toaster. If counter space is important to you, note the dimensions before you buy it. I would never pay $250.00 for it. On the other hand, it does say Viking on the side to impress your friends and guests."
2,Beware! This book is not accurately titled,"I purchased this book. Unless you have a) photographic memory or b)a pretty good handle on the 1006 + 1945 characters already and just need a review every now and then, this book will be useless to you. It will be difficult to actually learn the kanji in such a way that you can recognize and write them at will, because this book is more like a dictionary listing terms and definitions.Even if you have a lot of time, there are smarter ways of learning Kanji. The Jorden-Harz books ""Reading Japanese"" for kanji and ""Japanese The Written Language"" for kana and kanji, are much better tools.Also, you can check the excellent ""Kanji in Context"" books from www.amazon.co.jp This series includes 2 workbooks and a better reference book. While it costs more to go this route, you save on time which is more precious in any case.It's not a bad book. The ""Guide to"" part of the title is deceptive though."
4,Another well done from the Tuttle Publishing House,"A clear & simple book on the learning of Japanese script.I cannot recommend the works of Tuttle Publishing enough in language learning, be it Chinese or Japanese, they always make learning an enjoyable routine."
2,Aweful choice...,"I had to buy this book for my kanji class. What a joke. Throughout the book there are stroke order mistakes and some of the characters, themselves, are incorrectly written. We spent a lot of class time correcting mistakes in the book. The romanization of words was not helpful to me because I can't read them. I prefer hiragana and katakana over romanization but that's a personal preference. I recommend ""Remembering the Kanji"" book 1 and 2 if you're looking for a self study."
3,not as good as other products,"After reading the reviews, I was hopeful that it would work as well for me as it has for others. Unfortunately, the product is average at best.The bottle is a good size, but it seemed to take a lot to cause itch relief to my scalp compared to other products (scalpicin, etc). This is likely due to lack of hydrocortizone. So I'm using a much more product than expected, given the price.Pros:-relieves scalp itchiness-slight cooling sensation when massaged into scalp-nice neutral scent (not to feminine of a smell)Cons:-take much more product to relieve itchiness compared to other products-lacks active ingredients found in other stronger products-not quite as effective"
3,Leave-In Treatment for Scalp Psoriasis,"I bought this planning on using it on a particularly bad spot of Psoriasis on my scalp. It does seem to help, but the messiness outweighs the usefulness of this product to some degree. I use it directly out of the shower before bed and always shower in the morning. I can't imagine leaving it in during the day since it has such a powerful fragrence and ends up matting the hair after it dries. I'm still undecided on whether or not I'll buy again since the price of this product is so low."
1,Not noticeable effect,Often after shampooing (with various products) I would get a dry or tight scalp and itchy feeling that could be quite intense.Scalpicin usually helped with the immediate symptoms but I thought this product might have more of a preventative effect.Clearly this stuff helps some people but for me it had no noticeable effect at all on my symptoms. And the thick consistency made it hard to apply evenly as I have long hair.
1,makes matters worse,"It does not make any flakes go away, in fact they get A LOT worse after using as recommended. Maybe for an hour, the product allows you to ""control"" the flaking. I'm SURE there are better products or better ways of doing this.The product contains Ether and Salicylic Acid. My opinion is that these two ingredients are the products downfall. Both drying and irritating, these may actually tear up the ""good"" skin cells that are left on the scalp."
2,Where was the editor on this one?,"I sure hope Mr Lamit designs Pro/E parts better than he designs books. After 8 years of higher education (no, not dim, just got 2 degrees and a Masters), this is unquestionably the most difficult-to-follow and poorly edited textbook I've ever had the displeasure of using. This is the quintessential engineer-trying-to-write-a-book book. Hardly a page goes by that isn't absolutely overwhelmed with call-out boxes, ""Important Reminders!"", unnecessary inset notes, diagram indication arrows flying all over the place, and general layout chaos. Pro/E is a difficult program to learn, and this book doesn't help matters. It is thorough in its coverage, but be prepared to be frustrated."
3,WARNING: Not Macintosh compatible,"You have to read the fine print on the Olympus web site very carefully to discover that this printer is not compatible with the Macintosh OS. According to their Technical Support, there are no plans to develop a driver for the Mac.I am able to use mine as a PictBridge printer, printing directly from the camera. Its prints are fair to good, but not excellent. But since I cannot print my stored images from my computer, I will sell the P-10 and buy something else, and it probably will not be manufactured by Olympus."
5,Music that will make your Hawaiian soul soar,"Hapa harmonize like no other duo. When their voices join in the telling of Hawaiian legend, lore and love, all hearts soar. Unparalleled guitar work - the sounds that come from that guitar make you laugh out loud with pure pleasure. The world is a better place with Hapa."
5,A powerful love story!!,"Kat is definitely my favorite romance writer and I loved this book tremendously. At times it was hard to read, because of some of the tragedies these 2 face, but their love is deep enough to pull them through. I found the story very compelling, the characters wonderful, and the depth of the emotions rich and rewarding. I had read Devil's Prize first, so knew of the characters from that, and I'm so glad I finally found this one to find out how their story came about. Kat always writes in such a way that I absorb the characters into my life while I am reading the book and for days after."
5,Sweet Vengence,"This is a great book. I got so wrapped up in the story line that I cried when they cried. I love to read a story that affects me this deeply. As usual, Kat Martin has done it again.If I could give this book more than 5 stars I would do so."
2,"5"" Pads Holes don't Match Disks","I am telling this so Porter Cable will start Makeing the 5 Inch Vac. Pad, match the 5 Inch Hole in the Sanding Disks.I wondered why the 6 Inch Pad Matched the 6 inch Disks,then I noticed that Porter Cable used the Same Size Center as the 6 inch.When you use the Center the same as the 6 Inch the 5 Inch Holes don,t match the sanding Disks because the metal in the Center is in the Space that the Vac. Holes are Supposed to be.You hold them next to each other or use A tape and you see they are Blocking part of the holes in the 5 Inch Vac. Sanding Disk.I Hope Porter Cable Makes changes but it would Cost to much for them to do that.So The 6 Inch Match but The 5 Inch cover's part of the Vac. Hole so shop somewere Else,Like I am Doing. Good Luck and check them out when you order them.Maybe this will Help Some Body like Me who is Disabled ,Thats why I Order on Line.Later Polebender II"
3,"WELL U WANNA KNOW WHAT ITS LIKE, DONT YA.....","Youve gotta respect Boyz II Men, they know how to sing. On this album they start off all funky (trying to reinact destiny's child and P!nks style - not saying thats a bad thing).However after the ""bouncey"" (and by bounce i mean ""bouncey"") ""Bounce, Shake, Move, Swing, things die down to pure Boyz II men ballads.After the first listen they all tend to blend into one, but im hoping thats gonna change.This CD is not bad, but its not brilliant, with contributions from Shakespear & Kandi as well as Shep Crawford, this CD has the ingredients to be good, however at the moment im still unsure.Stand Out track: Step On Up!"
5,The best R&B album of the year,"I love this CD so much . The songs are amazing and so touching. Not only are Boyz II Men excellent balladeers, they also are great songwriters. I think that Shawn and the guys are just so creative, there's nothing they can't do. I love all the songs like ""Pass You By"", ""Thank You in Advance"" and ""I Finally Know"" but my absolute favorite is ""I Do."" That song is so beautiful and the harmonies are amazing. I'm going to play that song when I get married. Anyway, the CD is definately one that any music fan should not miss. Sure there are many talented bands out there right now, but like the CD stickers says,""The Originals Return"" and they're going to stay on top."
3,not up to their own high standards,"I'm sorry to say this as a long time Boyz II Men fan, but their newest album is simply not up to par with their previous levels of excellence. Most would agree that ""Evolution"" falls short of maching the quality of ""II"", however their latest attempt is not much better. ""Dreams"", ""Pass You By"" and ""What the Deal"" stand out in an otherwise mediocre CD. Perhaps the anticipation and high expectation for this group was further heightened by three years producing and recording, but only to culminate into songs that don't quite measure up. My humble suggestion for the Boyz would be to hook back up with Babyface, James Harris III and Terry Lewis for their next CD. Otherwise, this talented group will never return to the level that they reached in 1994 with ""II""."
2,not a 4 or 5 star effort,"This is far from a 4 or 5 start outing. However there is the stand out track ""I finally know"". I play this one several times in a row when it comes ont my mp3 player. Too bad the rest of the CD wasn't this good."
5,Amazing Recovery,I have been a fan of BIIM since they their music fist came out with River Runs Dry. I have all of their albums and I have to say that this may be the best yet. It's music is more up beat than the last two albums but it's amazing. You can DANCE to the beats of the first songs. I'm glad the Boyz are back and better than ever.
4,An impressive comeback,"Well, the boyz are back!! Their newest effort is very solid, and I have loved listening to it. Nathan, Shawn, Michael, and Wanya write almost every song on the cd, which definately impresses me. They have some great producing by Shek'spere and Kandi on some of the opening tracks, like #1 Beautiful Women and #3 Good Guy. and of course, their ballads (my personal favorites:) are wonderful. I would definately recommend #6 I finally know, #11 Never go away, and #13 Know what you want, even though they're all pretty great. The only reason I didn't give this cd five stars was because I am kind of partial to their album, II. I don't think this cd is quite up to that level, but other than that, it's great and it's one of the cds I always keep nearby."
4,Glad I Gave Them A Chance,"Here it is, over a decade since they made their mark in the entertainment industry and Boyz II Men still have the ability to make quality music that distinguishes them from the rest of the bunch. I have not been into Boyz II Men since they released their second album, II. But, after hearing a couple of songs from this album, I was reminded of how good they are. My favorites are Step On Up, I Finally Know, Pass You By, Dreams(arguably the best track), I Do and Do You Remember. Boyz II Men show us what real love ballads are supposed to sound like."
4,Nice Work Boyz!,"I think that this album is great! I love the first track 'beautiful women', although it would probably get the feminists fumming, it is good to groove to.Boyz II Men doing the latino thing? At first I thought that it was funny (especially the bit where Shawn sings ""then I could keep all these beautiful women""), that sounded funny seeing as they are afro-american. But hey, its a good song.""Step on Up "" also rocks. The background vocals are so great! I thought it was Michael Jackson at first (who is it by the way?)After 'Evolution' many are totally put off the guys (seeing as the whole album was totally depressing to listen to) but this one makes me believe that they are back (fingers crossed). This album better sell through the roof, which I hope it does inspite of the fact that the album was available like a month and a half before release date on the web (theifs!)In conclusion, this album is great for the car! Lots of sing a long tracks! C-ya!"
5,THE BEST ALBUM OF ALL TIMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This album is so amazing. I love every song on it. My favorites are ""Thankyou in Advance"" that song just sounds so good that it makes me want to fall in love I will never get tired of it as long as I live. My other favorite one is ""Know what you Want"" that song is the da bomb too! It's so pretty that it makes me want to cry. I just can't express how much I love this album. I wish I could tell Wanya, Nathan, Shawn, and Micheal how great this album truly is.I have over 50 CD's in my collection and I swear this is the best album that I own now. EVERYONE GO OUT AND GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Best R&B Album EVER...,"All what I can say is that... this album is the best album ever of my all collection, sweet rhymes mixed with legendary voices that sweeps into your soul and never leave you alone without imaginning and illsutrating yourself flying in heaven... Whenever I go out anywhere, this album is like a must to my Walkman, and seriously... Boyz II Men are just growing more and more. I can't tell what's my favorite song, cause every single song is a world by it self... and it is such an amazing combination between all types of R&B styles in just one disc that is really a breath taking... and if you consider yourself a good R&B listenner, you should get this one right streight from the closest store RIGHT NOW !!!"
2,bad,sorry but this album just ain't good the boyz may be the greatest singers but they just dunt know how to craft a great melody... yep babyface's production is being sorrly missed on this oneand for those who dunt agree just check the charts this is no where to be seen (and please dunt blame the music industry or boy bands..)
4,They've done it again!,Boyz II Men always amazes me with there lyrics. It is as though they can look into couples hearts and know exactly what they are feeling and what they need to hear. They also get the single people with the way they always show that love is on the way you just have to be patience and wait.
4,Good Product,"This is a good product. When I first bought it, it cleared up my skin nicely. However, it seems to dry the skin if you use it for a long time."
2,A disappointment,"I have dry, sensitive skin, and I hoped that this soap would be an effective and gentle cleanser. But it was a disappointment. The first thing I noticed about it when I opened the package was the strong fragrance. No product for sensitive skin should contain perfume of any kind. This soap does not lather well. It does not do an effective job of removing makeup. It is also very messy in a soap dish, leaving a thick puddle of white residue. There are far better soaps on the market for sensitive skin, and I recommend you avoid this one.Eileen Rieback"
5,Great narration....,"This book has gotten some moxed reviews, but I found it entertaining. However, I am reviewing it as an audiobook. It is fun to guess who the actors are supposed to be- ""The Pheonix"" is totally Cher, ""Shaggy and Scooby"" seem to be Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche, and And Carla Selena, aka ""C.Sa."" obviously is like J. Lo. The abridgement is also very good, and didn't leave out important story gaps.The content of the book is pretty decent, but the narrator does a great job going from vioce to voice, giving each character a unique sound or accent so there is no confusion as to who is speaking. Her Southern accent is spot on. A good book on CD!"
1,I wish Amazon offered a money-back guarantee,"Alex is an unlikable, self-centered, vain woman who alternates between ""poor me"" rants and ""it's my way or the highway"" demands on her assistant (who, beyond my comprehension, is actually her friend and doesn't seem to mind her condescending ways).This is a Hollywood-focused attempt at the insight offered in ""The Devil Wears Prada"", but, unfortunately, falls short. Instead of being acerbic, it's just whiney; instead of being comic, it's just sad. The good thing is, when I was bored enough to ""tune out"", tuning back in brought me closer to the end (I finished out of devotion to my book club).If you want an insider's glimpse of Hollywood, view ""The Player"" of ""LA Story"" instead. This book doesn't deliver."
2,Dry and Boring,"If you're interested in dinosaur systematics and how one digs up a fossil in California, then you'll probably think this book is just fine. If, however, you are interested in learning about dinosaur evolution, behavior, ecological roles, trends, etc, don't bother with this book. One has to strain to pick out any interesting information.PSWho are these top 500 reviewers that write ridiculously glowing reviews for mediocre books? I don't think I've ever seen one give less than five stars. I wouldn't be surprised if they're getting paid for all their wonderful advertising."
5,"a frightening, exciting journey into the unknown","I wasn't sure of what to expect with this book, but was struck by suprise. Once starting it, I simply couldn't put it down! Staying up all night for two nights should say something for this book. Sara fights to understand where she belongs in her world...her internal, imaginary one, the idealistic one her teaching school set her up with, the depressing one her father wished her into, the fantastic journey her mother wished for her, and the one with her new people (you'll just have to see, don't want to give it away). I think this book would be enjoyable to any person to read, man or woman, as the struggles Sara faces, we all face (secretely or not). I found my own self in her world, wondering in which one she would eventually find herself."
4,I Feel Connected to Sara,"I received this book as a gift from a friend who knows I was born in New Mexico and am attracted to stories such as this.I started reading it and couldn't put it down. After 5 cups of tea and numerous indents on my couch, I finished it! I loved the whole story of how this woman came to find her true self after years of struggle (mostly due to men!).She is captivating and vunerable, stong yet fragile. The story brings to life a different time and place than what we are living in. Yet... all woman at one time or another find strength and courage and come into their ""own"" so with that... we can all relate to Sara.A great rainy day... cup of tea... read!"
1,Magically Learns Complex Indian Language Overnight,"Kate Horsley has some really awesome books out there. This is not one of them. While it starts off interesting with Sara being hated by her family (for being female?) and falling in love with a religious instructor, it really goes down hill when the couple makes there way West. If you want a romance book that objectifies American Indians and mocks their culture, here you are, because that's basically the last 1/3 of the book. I was extremely disappointed and if I hadn't read Pagan Nun or Changeling first, I never would have after reading this embarrassment."
3,It was okay.,"I just moved to New Mexico from Pennsylvania and also had read that Julia Roberts liked this book in O magazine.Anyway, I didn't like much of it or get the ending. She killed her husband and this was acceptable!I do get that the book is about survival and all, but I supsect that maybe the woman was crazy! If her own people thought she was crazy then maybe there was something to it. It was a very unusual book but doubting whether the woman was sane or not doesn't help my opinion of it.It was a fast read and entertaining though and has also gotten me interested in learning about New Mexico's history and more about the Indians. I must say I feel a lot of compassion for them after reading the book."
2,ok,Not what I expected. Did not enjoy it at all. Not what I like to see from this author. Not recommended to purchase.
3,great but short,"Big fan of his books, but this one was really short. It had a great meaning. Great deal for the price"
4,TAPNSEE,Oil degreaser little pricey but it does work well.STRAIGHT OR DILUTED IT DEPENDS ON HOWMUCH GREASE THERE IS.
2,Kind Of Flat,"This book starts off with a good hook, but then the story starts to drag. I really tried to like these characters, but they just seemed a little flat. A complex plot flies off in too many directions. If you are into police procedure and conspiracy, this one might appeal to you, but I found it to be rather tedious."
1,Cardboard characters,I thought the writing was cliche-ridden and the characters were one-dimensional. I suggest Mr. Bishop read some Ridley Pearson or James Lee Burke to see how characters should be drawn. I will admit the plot idea was pretty good.
5,Foundation for Programmble Hardware,"This book is used for the classic junior level microprocessor class at Montana State University - Bozeman (where Cady teaches) and is the starting point for modern digital design. After an ""Intro to Logic Circuits"" class this book then gives the essential foundation to build upon with more advanced design classes. The microcontroller book (also by Cady) comes after this one."
3,A bit boring for a war novel,"I agree with the other readers who prefer novels with more character development and human element. The high-tech aspects are very well presented, and one ends the book wanting to know more about sonars, communications, etc., but as a game this seems a bit boring. How come the hero's countermeasures always work against the enemies' torpedos and the enemies' countermeasures never work against the hero's torpedos? How come the hero's torpedos nearly always hit & kill and the enemies' torpedos never hit?"
5,Great fun in a Los Angeles class SSN,"As a big Tom Clancy fan, I enjoyed reading SSN so much that I bought the game. The books was fun; not a lot of character development or background, but it really helped you feel what it would be like on a SSN in the middle of a war. Possibly not as realistic as it should be; 60 + kills without a scratch, but, as an American, there's nothing I like reading more than our guys goin our and kickin some butt"
1,Machine Generated Text,"I bought this book as a reflex, being a fan, only to discover that someone has written a simplistic automatic Clancy text generator. Not only does this book not read like a TC book, it does not appear to have been written by a human of any kind. The absence of plot, character, or even well constructed sentances indicate this was written by a 16 bit WordBasic macro"
2,Tom Clancy?,"When I bought the book, I was expecting a novel, but whatMr. Clancy wrote was a myriad of experiences that were notrealistic. Writing from a game, where you win on the firstshot at playing is not real life. The novel did not flowlike other Clancy novels, the plot was not tied togetherwell. I expected a ""stay in your seat"" novel and read, butI could take a lot of breaks, well, thats the way it iswhen you play a game and can save your score. Come on Mr.Clancy where are you?"
2,Painful Fiction,"I have always found Tom Clancy's novels somewhat difficult to swallow. He books always contain technology that always seems to surpass all other nations of the world. In SSN, a Los Angeles Class submarine is called into action against the Chineese navy when the Chineese invade the Spratney Islands. In a nut shell, this U.S. submarine not only takes on and destroys every submarine and surface ship the PLAN can send at it, but it also destroys many of Russias most advanced submarines, operated by Russian sailors. I lost cout of the number of ships and subs sank, but it had to be well over 30, and all by a lone U.S. sub. This was a painful read as each and every mission was very predictable, as well as very unbelievable."
2,Not much of a Clancy book this time,"Don't take this book thinking Clancy is doing it again. If you like sub warfare, I guess it will be good for you; for the Clancy's fan, better look elsewhere.The story is about only one submarine hitting more than 60 targets in a half secret war. Most of the story don't make much sense (in my thoughts) where the US are not sending much of the US fleet against China and bet on that one submarine.And don't get me wrong, I've read 90% of Tom Clancy's book so I do like most of his work."
1,Unspeakably bad,"This has to be the worst waste of time I can remember reading. I gave it one star because 0 stars wasn't an option.There's no characterization, no plot development, no suspense. The political developments that set the frame for the submarine warfare are implausible. There's no parity between the Russian/Chinese forces and the American's, so there isn't any conflict. Everything the US sub does works perfectly. Everything the enemy does fails.I gather that this is a novelization of a computer game. If so, it's a walkthrough of a game where the player has done everything right. Like all walkthroughs, it makes the game look boring, by concealing all the opportunities to go wrong.If you see this one in a yard sale for a dime, save your money and your time."
2,SSN is more of a laundry list than a book,"US Sub vs. Contender #1 -- US winsUS Sub vs. Contender #2 -- US winsUS Sub vs. Contender #3 -- US winsetc, etc, etc....this is the first Clancy book i have ever considered not finishing... it is horrible! Not only is the narrative very hurried, it is extremely bland... there is not a bit of suspense in this entire book.Clancy is a very good author, SSN is definately one of his less exciting works...Save your money (or get one of his Jack Ryan books)"
1,An Awful Waste of Time,Eleventy times the skipper gets his orders. Eleventy times the torpedos run hot and true. Eleventy times the enemy gets sunk.Not one personality in this book. Skip it.
2,SSN totally lacking in suspense,"I had a real problem with the way SSN is written: the narrative style reports every sub battle in a passive, after-the-fact style that leaves no doubt what will happen. Even if you know the good guys (assume Americans) will win every battle with nary a scratch, at least include dialog and elements of tension that suggest other possible outcomes. I would find it implausible that any U.S. sub could outthink, outmanuever, and outgun so many opponents. Beware these ghost writer books with Clancy's name on them."
1,Repetitive.....Repetitive.....Repetitive.....Repetitive.....,"This is not one of his better works, unless you really want to become intune with the routines of a submariners thought process. It is very repetitive as you will find out if you give it a read."
2,Not one of Clancy's best,"This was not one of Clancy's greater novels. Some of the action scenes kept you rivited but, after awhile it was hard to believe one submarine could sneek up on the entire Chinese fleet and sink over 100 ships and subs. Also, there was a lot of repetitive sayings such as ""open the outer doors"" ""make tubes one and two ready"" etc.. every action paragraph. Finally, The book is easy to follow and I have to commend his knowledge of warfare but, this was not one of his finest writings."
1,patriots only,"I never have any trouble finishing a Clancy, which is usually way too soon, but this time I really had to urge myself to keep reading for the good part to come....to no avail. I'm sure the real American patriot will disagree, but this book is surely the most unrealistic I have ever read."
2,A Lesson in Acronyms,"I wish I had read the customer reviews before buying this book. I will finish it only because that's my policy, though I keep hoping something different will happen. Unlike Hunt for Red October, this one barely has a story, and what story it has is simply repeated over and over again. Read the first quarter of the book and you've read the whole book. Pop some popcorn and rent a video."
2,"Too much action, too little suspense","I loved the original Clancy books (Ryan Series), and was very disappointed with the garbage of the ""Net"" series. I was hoping this would be a return to the glory days; it was not.The plot was a little thin for this reader, and while I enjoy the action aspect of most books, this one had way too much of it, and each encounter had anticipated results. If he was fired on, he evaded successfully. If you were shooting torpedos, you always hit the mark. The action was there but the suspense wasn't.That is not to say that SSN was a bad book. It still provided a few hours of enjoyment, but not the true excitement one would expect from a Clancy novel.Tom needs to stop counting his money and return to that which made him popular."
1,SSN - A Submarine Combat Thriller?,"Tom Clancy's ""SSN"" ranks high in my list of ""most unenjoyed books"". The book cover states that SSN is ""a submarine combat thriller complete with stirring plots and characters."" I wonder if the reviewer bothered to take the time to read as far as the second page? This novel contains no character development and no plot; only American propaganda, where the American hero makes no mistakes, and every Chinese captain is inept and glory-driven."
1,ssn,"This is just like a 'Sgt. Rock' comic book. No character development, the enemy is inherently evil and incompetent, and the hero kills everybody while complaining about what hot sweaty work it is. Even the techno talk is repetitious. Definitely a low point for Clancy."
1,Clancy sinks himself,"I can't believe how poor this ""novel"" is. SSN is totally devoid of character development - the writer (which was probably not Clancy) did not even bother to name the Cheyenne's officers. Dialogue and action were monotonous (open doors one and two...), and featured the Cheyenne single-handedly annihilating the entire Chinese navy.I now know that it was meant to be a guide for the SSN computer game. Should definitely not be a standalone read. I like Clancy a lot, but this one will not be making my book shelf.STAY FAR AWARE!"
1,Terrible Book,"After the first few battles, you knew that the Cheyenne was not going to get killed. It was about as interesting as watching someone else play a video game with cheats enabled so they couldn't ever be killed. Don't waste your time on this book. Tom should be embarrassed."
4,SSN,If you like war and submariens then I think you would like this book. The book is about a sub called the uss Cheyenne which goes to the China sea once the US is at war with Chaina. It talks about alot of battles its been in from the beging to the end of the brief war against China. It also talks about some of the weopons they used in the war.
1,From now on I will read the reviews,"2/3 of the way through this book, and no plot, no suspense, no character developement. Our countermaasures always work, theirs never work. Boring, Predictable, un-beleivable. Then I brought up the reviews! At least I'm not alone. If only I had done that befpre buying I could have saved my time, money, and respect for Tom Clancey."
1,"If you read the first couple of chapters, youve read it ALL","I read half the book and just couldnt finish it...it was awfull! Clancy has really gone downhill from ""Hunt for Red October"" and ""Red Storm Rising."" The story is unbelievable , predictable, an insult to the readers. Can you really believe that one sub scored sixty victories in one operation? READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE YOU BUY IN THE FUTURE!"
1,Not up to Clancy's standards,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. I think that about sums it up. No character development whatsoever. Even a tiny glimpse into the personality of the faceless enemy would have been welcomed. While I am sure that American submarines are the finest made and manned, I find it implausible that each and every enemy vessel, faced by Cheyenne, was manned by an incompetent crew and led by an equally incompetent captain. If this was intended as a users guide for the compter game, then I was either mistaken or misled when I purchased this book. Storyline...Cheyenne sails, Cheyenne kills multiple enemy vessels, Cheyenne re-arms, Cheyenne sails, Cheyenne kills multiple enemy vessels, Cheyenne re-arms...you get the idea. It's hard to believe that the same author that brought us ""Hunt for Red October"" had a hand in ""crafting"" this mess."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I like Tom Clancy but this is not him. Even in the Amazon listing it doesn't show it but the fine print at the bottom of the cover says ""Created by Tom Clancy and Martin Greenberg"".Either Clancy is cranking books out too fast or he's selling his name.One chapter might as well be a cut and paste of the previous.I've read two books now that were ""co-authored"" by Clancy and neither was worth a damn. I will never buy another one."
1,"Boring, predicable","If you like wrestling, Rambo or Superman, you'll like this one. It is Superman in a Submarine. He knows all, conquers all obstacles. The outcome is never in doubt. Repetitious, duplicative, predictable."
1,All of my respect for Tom Clancy is completely gone,This book is the equivalent of watching a twelve year-old play a computer game. I bought it in an airport to read on the plane and got more entertainment out of the flight safety card. I'll never read Clancy again until he repays me for this travesty!
1,"Belongs in a software box, not a bookshelf","Having read so many excellent Tom Clancy books, I can't help but feel cheated. While I still consider Clancy a great writer (how many other authors can write 1,000 page ""nailbiters""?), SSN is truly a waste of time, money, and paper.From what I understand, this book relates to a software game he made. This story should've been in the box with the game manual, not as a book. Clancy could've been ahead of the curve and written a thriller about WWIII involving China and America ... instead he wrote the same boring lines over and over again. No thought, no involvement, and no interest on the part of the reader. SSN was a real stinker. I wish I had read the reviews here before I bought the book!"
1,how about 0 stars,"One star is too much, how about 0 stars! If you are unlucky enough to have bought this book,and have not read it yet, save yourself some time and pick out any chapter and read it. After you read that chapter, throw the book away,you have read the whole thing. The endless redundacy of ""make tubes one and two ready in all respects"" and ""units from tubes one and two running hot,straight, and normal"" is mindless. Maybe you get a mindless book, by writting about a video game. Has Mr. Clancy written his last great novel? I don't think so! Has he written his last sequel to a video game? I sure hope so!"
1,Clancy at his worst,"Tom must have been really bored when he wrote the book. UN sanctions against China? With China a permanent member of the UN Security council it would be rather difficult to get the UN to take ANY meassure against China.As far as submarine strategy is concerned, the book is full of errors and inacuracies. I wonder what role the coauthor (a British Sub Captain) played. Were they getting drunk together, while writing the book?Complete waste of time and money.Don't bother with it."
3,Reading a game. Yippe:(,"Granted it's got Clancy's incredible knowledge of submarine warfare (and warfare in general). But it is just shoot, sink; shoot, sink. There's no character or deep plot development at all. So read it if you have the game and need to be more proficient. Not for a good bedtime adventure"
5,Details and Details,"In this book, the descriptions of objectives, its sense of realism, and strategic thinking made this book fast paced and easy to follow. The drama was very good and it is a geologically correct setting, I can't see why a ""Chreme Puufed Doughnut"" can't be a relaxing break from other books."
2,This book is a cream-filled donut,"It appeals to you while reading it and you might even gobble it quickly, but nausea comes soon after you're done.plot -- nopecharacter development -- nosirreerealistic action -- ix-nayreasonable denouement -- nonIt's sad to watch Clancy devolved into Don Pendleton."
1,what happened?,"Clancy has sold his name to the highest bidder, not the best storyteller. This book has about a page worth of plot-- ""identify sub, shoot sub, next sub please"".Please Tom, stick to the great novels and quit letting these hacks throw your name in bold on really bad books."
2,Not his best,"I'm a big fan of Clancy's older works, but his new efforts leave a lot to be desired. Clancy shmoozes with military personnel, gets interesting inside info, and then further ingratiates himself by writing extremely flattering books about them. I'd like to believe that a single SSN could take out most of the Chinese Navy, but I'm a little skeptical, and the bit with the deposed Chinese leader was just too much.........."
3,Surely not written by Tom Clancy,"SSN was suspenseful; I'll give it that. But it was highly unrealistic. It's about a submarine called USS CHEYENNE that goes to war with the Chinese. To make a long story short, the USS CHEYENNE takes out the whole Chinese fleet of submarines(Not to mention some surface ships), and also some Soviet submarines, all by itself. It was also clearly not written by Tom Clancy. Maybe the initial idea came from him, but not the writing. And we all know the reason we like Tom Clancy is not only for his complex plots, but also for his addictive writing style. Good book. Unrealistic. Not written by Tom Clancy."
4,Not all bad,"I liked it...But it was hard to beleive how the Cheynenne sank the entire Chinese Navy alone. Also, why do the Cheynenne's anti-torpedo devices ALWAYS work and the CHINESE and even other AMERICAN ships not work at all?"
2,Not Clancy's best,"This obviously was not intended to be a work that standsalone. You need to have played the CD-ROM game in order to appreciatethe ""novel"". Actually, it is the absolute worst Clancy book that I have ever read. The character development is mediocre at best, the plot is logical but rather unimaginatve as compared to all of his other novels, and the descriptive passages are pathetic. I know Tom can do better, but I think that he just wrote this for the gamers. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK WITHOUT THE GAME. YOU WILL BE WASTING YOUR TIME AND MONEY. However, the work does have the one saving grace of being well-researched as far as the military tech and tactics are concerned. I am still a fan of Tom Clancy. **"
3,Mr Clancy what heck are you trying to pull off ?,"Well bought this book expecting to be like the other Clancy'sbut ""beep"" (wrong) , in this book you'll read how the americans will kick Chinese rear-end easily on the Spratley islands .Easy victory , if the chinese were so easy why even bother sending equipment to Taiwan ?In short US SSN kills one after another Chinese Sub without being threated a lot ... one would think there would be some heavy confrontation but no every kinda seems to easily fall into the American favor ... How about writing a book where you loose first and win afterwards ? should be more exciting ...Better next time"
1,Terrible!!!,"This has got to be the worst book I have ever read in my life? I swear after the first two chapters its just copy and paste the rest of the way, what a bore fest this one turned out to be, my advice, which is free, stay away from this one!!"
2,All these Reviews are Right...,"All of the reviews on this Clancy are right - it's got one SUPER HERO - who single-handedly wins it all...made completely out of CARDBOARD... And that's the ONLY character that there is...everybody else is just 3 or 4 letter job titles (OOD, COB, etc.). Part way through I waxed nostalgic for Hunt For Red October...which had GREAT characters...and SUB scenes that kept you glued to your chair... Moral: it is important to distinguish between books written by Clancy (where he's the only name in the Author slot) - and books that Clancy has lent his name to for economic reasons (which have multiple names in the Author slot). Grab up all you can of the former - and as few as you can of the latter. If you succumb and buy the second type anyway - pretend it's by somebody else because, actually, it is..."
3,"SSN: not Clancy's best....but not his worst, either","While this is not the usual top notch novel by Tom Clancy, it wasn't meant to be a fully fledged novel. It is a companion book to a CD-ROM game published by Simon and Shuster in 1996. If you are a fan of the game, and some people are, then it's a bit of fluff to read while on a long plane flight or bus ride.If you aren't a fan of books based on games or expect great literature, then this book is not for you."
2,This book is a cream-filled donut,"It appeals to you while reading it and you might even gobble it quickly, but nausea comes soon after you're done.plot -- nopecharacter development -- nosirreerealistic action -- ix-nayreasonable denouement -- nonIt's sad to watch Clancy devolve into Don Pendleton."
2,Disappointed,"I've not read much of Tom Clancy's work, but based on what little I have read, I held out much hope for this book. It definitely did not deliver.While the action ""scenes"" were quite fun, they were also rather repetitive. There was very little plot, and no character development. The end result is a story that is about as believable as a Rambo movie. I very seriously doubt that the entire Chinese navy, which was being constantly augmented with Soviet boats and crews, could be eliminated by a single sub. I don't buy it, and neither should you."
5,A war submarines fight in a war against China,"Tom Clancy's SSN is about a submarine Cheyenne and her crew in the Pacific Ocean that has been put out to watch for other Chinese war ships or submarines. When America is forced to go to war with China, Cheyenne is given the order to destroy any Chinese ship or submarine that they find on their never- ending battle throughout the Pacific. Towards the climax, the crew learns that the Russians are selling Typhoon Class submarines (the largest yet created) to the Chinese, which has already put them into the ocean. This book combines interesting facts about submarines and the ocean with an adventurous story by Tom Clancy."
1,Super Sub to the Rescue!,"Carrier group out of the picture? no problem, send in super sub!Seas full of enemy subs? no problem, send in super sub!Russians getting involved? no problem, send in super sub!No character development? no problem, send in super sub!No plot development? no problem, send in super sub!Clancy loosing it in a big way? Maybe there is one thing super sub can't save."
1,Not Worth The Money or The Time,"A dime store ""novel"", at best, which, after reading a few pages, I realized was not anything close to a real book. Should not have been represented as a new Tom Clancy novel and certainly should not have had the promotional references to character development on the back cover. Repetetive passages about perfect submarine kills with no true represetation of realities of life at sea, maintenance or weapons problems. I fault the bookstore for displaying it as a Tom Clancy novel, and I fault Tom Clancy for not clearly labelling this as NOT a novel."
2,Unrealistic in the Extreme!,"The American L.A. Class submarine Cheyenne killing more than 60 Chinese vessels and essentially winning this limited war single-handed without getting so much as a scratch? Get serious! I know Chinese submariners and Russian submarines may not be quite the equal of ours, but this was ridiculous. Even the way it was written stunk - no emotion, no drama, no excitment. I think Mr. Clancy's popularity is going to start sliding badly if he keeps allowing his name to be associated with such as this."
1,Mr. Clancy has no respect for his readers,"This is one of the worst books I ever read. I did not go further than page 192. Platitudes, repetitions, and military jargon diarrhea are what this book is all about. Where is the plot? The Chinese Navy is portrayed as providing ""sitting ducks"" for the glory of USS Cheyenne. Feeding a computer with randomly chosen Navy manuals would not have produced worse reading.Never again will I buy a book by the same ""author""."
1,Endless Repetition of Same Torpedo Launching Sequence,"This is possibly the worst book I have ever come across. Obviously, SSN is about submarine warfare - launching torpedoes to sink the enemies. Repeat the same battle scene once, twice, ..., 20 times, does that give you a novel? It would be nonsensical even as a computer game. As a book it is, simply, a waste of paper in the environmentally conscious world."
1,No way.,"On the basis of the many hours of great reading I have enjoyed from the pen of Tom Clancy I refuse to believe that he had any part in writing this amateurish waste of time. The book is boring, grammatically flawed, repititious, lackluster and totally without any redeeming feature. Clancy could do better than this during a visit to his dentist, indeed, to his proctologist. Don't even think about wasting your time or money on this miserable waste of paper."
1,Reads like a linear video game,"Not a bad read, but the plot is simple and 1 dimensional. It does describe the technical aspects of submarine warfare, but the plot was repetitive. Enemy subs sighted, go to them, destroy. The video game would be more exciting, with more variations. And for $15, this book wasn't really worth it."
1,wish I had the option of zero stars,"Very weak book, with bad writing, boring plot, little action. Clancy needs to hire better ghostwriters."
2,An obvious promotion for his computer game.,Only in a computer game could a single submarine sink 60+ ships without a single bit of damage. No character development to speak of and very predictable. Made a great coffee mug coaster while I was reading Computer Gaming World (hence the 2 stars).
1,Junk,"This book feels like an idiotic computer game set at the easiest setting. The most ridiculus is not having one submarine destroy almost single-handedly the chinese fleet, but having the USA military command send it to do so. Absolutely worthless. Compare to Red Storm Rising if you are interested in tactical and strategical military action."
5,Engaging war drama (audio CD version),"SSN is by far one of the best audio drama's I have purchased and would definitely recommend it (audio cd) to anyone considering purchasing it. I buy a lot of audio books both on tape and cd and I would recommend this audio adventure to anyone who loves an engaging war drama. Exciting and action packed, SSN stands above all others in audio production and special audio effects. I am looking forward to Tom Clancy's next project along this line. (I would like book publishers to know, this is the new standard they need to measure up to. Don't just read the story to tape, bring it alive and engage the listener.)"
1,"Repetitive chapters, some pretty action","Pretty much disappointing. If you don't have the computer game it's a waste of money, otherwise it's probably nice to see what tactics were used in each of the 15 scenarios.Probably a hell of a help for those playing the computer game.Lacks in character development, unsatisfying read.In short: BLAH! :("
3,"ASW Tactics, Si....","For Clancy purists, stop. For folks that have an airborne ASW orientation, read on. This exposition is best read by reading the interviews at the end of the book first, as the authoritative Brit ASW captain has validated the content, which itself rates 4 on a scale of 6. Canuks are arguably the best airborne sub-hunters in the biz, right behind the Brits as the subsurface best, no question. USN training and selection criteria are still outmoded, as Clancy himself has dug a hole with the Yanks. Good read, especially for me as a former airborne Nugget-only VNEra S-2 driver. Thanks to the Brits for sharing the jinks and inside skinny as much as is permitted in a rather classified area."
2,I'm glad I am not alone,"I am glad that I looked at the reviews on this book. I am about half way through it and keep getting lost in the Navy and submarine acronyms. I was beginning to think it was me! The book is definitely not one of Clancy's best. Normally, I recommend his books to everyone. However this book might only be of interest to former Naval personnel. I wonder what audience he was addressing?"
2,Rather disappointing,"A rather disappointing book from master writer Clancy, which resemples a ""shoot-em up"" game where all enemy submarines are easily killed by a US submarine (USS ""Cheyenne"") in 15 highly unrealistic scenarios. The class 688I boat is able to sink more than 60 Chinese submarines with astonishing ease. Her torpedoes never fail while Chinese weapons always miss their target and fall victims to decoys or mulfanctions. Clancy would have made a better book if the Chinese were reacting defensively and didn't have such an outraging incompetence as to have a diesel electric submarine in a war zone with its snorckel not operating! I'm interested mainly in the tactics of underwater warfare and here Clancy gives only a few tips. a very one-sided and completely unrealistic fictional book where Americans do all the damage and Chinese play the role of the siting ducks."
3,"Not A Great Novel, But OK As A Companion To The Video Game","As a rule, I love Tom Clancy's work. His major novels are superb. On the other hand, his throwaway novels - The Op Center series and others just done in paperback, are not very good.This book falls somewhere in the middle. Viewed as simply a novel, it would be very disappointing and certainly not up to Clancy's potential. When looked at as a companion guide to the SSN video game, it is fairly good.The purpose of the video game is to give players a slight feel for the issues involved in submarine warfare. Obviously it is not close to reality and this book is not either.I would recommend it for someone who is playing the video game to have a bit more context. If one is looking to buy it just as a story, I'd skip this one. Get 'The Hunt For Red October' and you'll be much further ahead."
2,I'll wait for the movie next time,"I found this book to be overly-technical and rather predictable in the plot. However, the synopsis, while outdated by a few years, is feasible. Many military experts do see a war with China within the next few years. Whether it will be a hot war or a cold war is up to the current Presidential administration.To tell you the truth, I expected better from Tom Clancy."
3,"If you understand the context, you might like this book...","If you read this book like a novel, you'll probably share many of the negative opinions that others have expressed. I think, however, that the book really is meant to be taken differently. In one sense, it appears to be a companion to the similarly-titled computer game. In this context, the book illustrates for the neophyte gamer how some of the game's scenarios might be successfully played. On a broader basis, the book also provides the non-gamer with a fictionalized sense of the tasks given to modern submarines, and how they might execute those tasks. So, as a novel, it's definitely sub-par for Clancy. As a fictional means of illustrating modern submarine warfare, it's actually a pretty good, interesting read."
3,"Decent, but needs a little work",This book had a great technical aspect. His descriptions of submarines and how warfare is carried out is tremendous. The plot was somewhat simple with almost no characterization. This does not even come close to a thriller by Patrick Robinson. Try again Mr. Clancy with more character flair.
3,"""Technically Good, But Needs A Better Delivery""","Mr. Clancy does a pretty good job showing you how a modern submarine operates in a combat situation. Unfortunetly, ""SSN"" is written without the usual Clancy flair. More should have been done to flesh out the characters. Plus the situations seemed to go off a little more perfectly than what you'd expect in a regular Clancy novel. Still, some good combat scenes, like ""Cheyenne"" against 7 Akula subs. Also the attack on the Chicom surface fleet was done well. Good interview at the end with Clancy and a Bristish sub captain. Still, the story could have been done better."
1,Clancy should put this in mothballs,"Wow-this stunk! It will be along time before I get another audio tape, because I'd rather listen to commercials while I commute than this junk. Clancy should hire better ghost writers."
1,Don't waste your time with this book!!,"This was one of the WORST books I have ever read. No story. No characters. Poor tactits. To sum this book up, Shoot...Kill, Shoot...Kill, Shoot...Kill. The End. If you want Excellent submarine fiction, read all the books by Michael Dimercurio."
2,It's entertaining,"Well, there is not much depth to the book, but if you are looking for action, you might find this entertaining."
1,Never turn a video game into a book,Dull book. Please do not turn any more video games into books if this is the type of product we will see. This was more like a how to win this game book than a story. I never finished it.
2,Not a typical Clancy - unfortunately,"Occasionally when I read Clancy's novels, I get frustrated with the volume of pages filled with futsy technical details. With this CD I found myself wishing for the details that I so often get bogged down with. Also, this CD fails to develop the characters in the way I have come to expect from Tom Clancy. All that aside, if you are not looking for a typical Clancy, this proved to be an entertaining albeit shalllow experience."
1,Technically Clancy but terribly weak plot,"As a cold war sub-mariner (MM1(SS/EWS), I couldn't wait to get my hands on SSN but finished it only out of pure dicipline. A far cry from Tom's other works."
1,SSN: a dud tin-fish,"Tom Clancy's ""SSN"" is a book written around acomputer game. As such, it is terrible trash. Here's theplot: A US Los Angeles-class submarine sinks three quarters of the Chinese navy and one quarter of the Russian navy without suffering a scratch. Here's the dialogue: ""Make tubes ready in all respects . . . tubes fired electrically . . . units from tubes running hot, straight and normal . . . two explosions."" Repeat, as needed, for about three hundred pages."
1,This is bad...,"There wasn't anything redeeming about this book at all. It was like reading the action sequences in a movie script (a bad movie script). Why would Clancy publish a book that's this thin on story? Does he still write, or is he a brand name now?"
1,This book is horrible.....,i read half the book. then i threw it away. the i took it out of the garbage and burnt it. then i pissed on the ashes. hahah. seriously it was the worst book ever. i should have just burnt the money i used to buy it. it would have been more exciting to listen to a tape recorder over and over and over and over. just my opinion.
3,Truly only the book of the game,"Yes, well - not a Tom Clancy novel as we know it, but more a mission by mission explanation of how to win the game of the same name (by the same author). Yes, one submarine taking on the whole Chinese navy is totally unrealistic, but lets face it, that's the game. Clancy actually does very well with this book, in that it reads pretty much as one would expect a submarine simulation game to be played. There isn't a hell of a lot of suspense - find the enemy sub, get his bearings, shoot the fish, boom!! Next chapter - get pinged by a frigate, get his bearings, shoot the Harpoon, boom!!! A light entertaining read while playing the game - don't expect another ""Red Storm Rising""."
1,Why was this book Written!,"I never write reviews but I hope that i may stop someone from buying this book. I got to page 200 and couldn't put it down fast enough. I think Clancy did a copy and paste with every chapter, they all sound the same. Please save your money and invest in a good book."
1,A Lousy excuse for a Book even if it is a good Computer Game,"Simply put, this is one big commercial for his computer game. If you buy the computer game, the book might come in handy. If not, you're wasting your money.This is a series of fifteen chapters which apparently correspond to events in the computer game. There is some common thread throughout the chapters, mainly that we are at war with China over the Spratley Islands and that Clancy's sub skipper, one Captain Mack Mackey, goes about various missions as we go to war. Tom Clancy in his introduction, freely states that the book is modeled after the computer game but he also says that his goal is to give the reader ""a strategy guide to submarine warfare"". There is some strategy. The strategy is to sell the computer game. Take the ""interview"" with his friends... a significant amount of that interview discusses how closely the book follows the game. Enough said.Dont buy it unless you're going to buy the game too."
1,"""Ouch""",It was painful trying to make myself finish this terrible book. This has to be the worst by Clancy and I usually love his writtings. Save your money!
2,Great Concept - Falls Short,"We have been using this book for about a month with our 7 & 9 year old. While the concept is great (short story presenting a problem then kids pick from 3 multi-choices after reading a scripture), I often find it frustrating for a couple reasons.First the 3 choices are often 2 ridiculously obvious non-choices followed by the third obvious answer. Second the scriptures used are often either irrelevant or such a stretch fit to the situation presented as to be irrelevant.It seems to me that the author had a great idea but got caught mass producing 365 situations. Hate to be a party-pooper, and happy that the book fits for some, but 'forewarned' for others who may find it like me. Strongly suggest a pre-read prior to purchasing."
2,"Fun, but choices are dopey.","We enjoy this book purely because we love laughing at the stupid multiple choice answers where it's so obvious which one you should pick. 99% of the time it goes something like this:Bob's friend broke a promise. Should Bob:a. Scream and hit his friend.b. Run away from his friend and never speak to him again.c. Forgive his friend.Yeah, pretty much just a waste of time.To add to that, the scripture references often don't even relate to the situation at all.Good idea, but falls ridiculously short of being even close to a good use of time."
2,"great concept, but ...","I agree with the other reviewer. The bible verses often do not seem to fit the story or they aren't appropriate for the age group. Often, my daughter (age 8) would ""get"" the intent of the devotion, but would then be confused by the ""scripture answer"" in the back of the book. I also find it tedious to keep flipping to the back for the answers. However, it IS a great conversation starter."
5,Very helpful,I would actually give this book a 4.45-very good & helps to bring the bible to real life by using it & applying it to realistic situations. A great way to get the family to talk about all types of issues that may come up in life
5,Take My Eyes,"Brilliant film, depicting domestic abuse, its affect on the victim and how it can take hold."
5,Red Wing Dinnerware by Ray Reiss,"Spendid coverage of most Red Wing dinnerware. Separated by years, it shows pictures and prices of individual pieces. Indexed by line and pattern, there is a picture guide to lead you to the pattern you are looking for. Easy to glance through to look for patterns. A must for the Red Wing buyer and seller. Don't make a deal without it. Reiss is the best."
2,"Really Bad for me,mabe GOOD for you !",The actors did a great job I just didn't get the tradition's . I can see some people really enjoying it. I really like all the actors. (Just did not enjoy it.)
5,"WOW!!, 50 cents!!!!!!","Found this disc at a yard sale, the young lady taking my money wearing a Britney Spears shirt, quote: ""It's my big brothers, it stinks!"", I just laughed. Great disc!, hard driving blues, saw them once in Indy, they were smoking! and this cd is smoking!!!!, too bad they are no longer together, what the previous reviewers have written, I echo!!!!!!"
3,Does the job,Charges my batteries but sometimes the red light indicating full charge comes on rather quickly and I am not ready to believe it can charge that fast
3,"Very uneven -- some good, some horrible","I give this the same rating as some of the other reviewers but I disagree as to the best and worst cuts. Little Richard's ""I Feel Pretty"" is a hoot and a holler, worth the price of the album by itself. Yeah, of course it doesn't sound like the cast album, but so what? Same for the rap ""Krupke"", Setzer's ""Jet Song"" and the ""America"" cut with Patti Labelle and Sheila E. These are sincere tributes from people who understand the spirit of what Bernstein and Sondheim were writing about, translated to their own idioms. Much more so than the terrible cuts with Trisha Yearwood and Phil Collins, esp. after Aretha did such justice to ""Somewhere"". And what the hell were they thinking with Kenny Loggins and Wynonna?"
2,Self-indulgent crap,"There are a few high points to this disc which I suppose make it worth owning, but on the whole I find it extemely off-putting. ""Somewhere"" will bring tears to your eyes, but, alas, the producer seemingly didn't have the balls to tell AF to wrap it up--and so it becomes tedious, the opposite of tasteful self-restraint. And Patti LaBelle? Well, she is the patron saint of masturbatory yammering. On the other hand, Brian Setzer cuts loose on ""Jet Song"" in a way that'd be certain to put a smile on the face of Mr. Bernstein. There are some nice interpretations, but all in all, it has an inorganic, overproduced, Yamaha DX7'y sound."
1,Horrible.,"I echo another listener's sentiments: ""what have they done to 'West Side Story?'"" This recording takes the absolutely beautiful music of the original musical and mangles it almost beyond recognition to offer up a modernized, rap-infused version for the culturally devoid listeners out there. My advice to someone unfamiliar with the musical: listen to the original broadway recording and don't bother with this."
4,"Little Richard on ""I Feel Pretty"" alone is worth the price.","Bought the CD through Amazon after hearing the Little Richard cut, ""I Feel Pretty"". Playing to type, LR gives one of his all time best performances. This cut alone is worth the price of CD.The rest of the CD - fair (Tevin Campbell - poor song choice for his otherwise cooool voice) to good (Selena - expected better) to outstanding (Aretha)"
3,Some fun -- some so-so.,"I enjoyed most of the music (even though I like the original much better). Some was very tedious, while some was very creative. I wish this CD had included the notes and performer information contained in the original release. Had to borrow a friend's CD to copy those notes."
3,Textbook,"I need this book for class, it is exactly what the professor wanted so it is working out so far"
3,Delivered fast and in great condition,"Book was delivered fast and was in perfect shape. I can't really comment on the content, I am not a stats person and have nothing to compare it too. This book is required for my grad level stats class. It was 10 bucks cheaper here than bookstore at school! One thing I can say is that it does have answers to odd numbered exercises in the back. That has already proven to be helpful. That way when you are doing the homework you can check as you go to make sure you are on the right track."
2,Statistics Text,- Lots of good written statistics examples.- Language is understandable.- Poorly organized
4,I Caught You a Delicious Bass,"Our son, a fan of the Napoleon Dynamite movie, will be 14 next week. He and his dad are ALWAYS quoting lines from the movie (which is actually is more funny than the movie for me!).When I saw Amazon had a talking Napoleon doll that said 18 phrases from the movie...well, i just had to get it.You push a button at the base to hear each phrase. I wish there were more than 18 phrases, but hey! The audio clips are loud and very clear--no hissing or muffle.I received the doll in 5 days, which is super fast! However, I see the doll is now TEN dollars higher than what I paid for it. It's a good deal at $24.95...but $34.95? That's pushing it, in my opinion.If you know a fan of the movie, I think they'd get a kick out of this talking figurine.UPDATE: The volume is VERY loud on this. We've had to tape all the holes in the base where the sound comes out. Way too loud, especially for kids. I'm talking hearing-damaging loudness."
5,The ring of adaptorbility,"This adaptor ring opens up a new world to me in my photography, without pictures would not be any good.Full stop."
3,"Interesting, but not a page turner","As one who is both a American history buff and a lover of mystery, PrivateEye novels- I was very drawn to this book.I am not familiar with the author James MacKay- he is very deep in hisresearch and writing.If you can get through the first 2 chapters of the book, You'll find avery interesting novel."
2,Filled with Minor Errors,"I was looking forward to reading what appeared to be a well written biography of Allan Pinkerton. On the surface, it is well written and entertaining. Unfortunately, there are questionable details reported through out the book. As a historian myself, I know some of the minor details regarding people in the Civil War years are wrong. Other facts are very questionable, and not footnoted, so we don't know his source. One example of this is Mackay's claim that a woman dressed up like a Confederate Solider was in fact Pinkerton Spy Hattie Lawton. There is nothing in the writings of the clerk who identified the soldier as a woman that suggest she was Lawton, and this fact is conveniently not footnoted. Another, more obvious error was a photo that was labeled as the Pinkerton headquarters in Chicago - the photo in question is actually of the New York branch. Errors happen, but should not happen so often."
4,another great Chieftains cd,REALLY nice-listening cd with beautiful irish music performed by a great group along with mix of fantastic musicians.
4,Wean them into loving Celtic music,"This is the album to buy for someone who you wish to convert to loving modern Celtic music. A who's who of great musicians from Sinead O'Connor to Mick Jaggar to Van Morrison with The Chieftains. Sad songs, happy songs, mostly sad.The Long Black Veil is a re-make of an American tune, which is utterly beautiful. The Foggy Dew is the other tune which is probably the best along with the title track.Along with a wide variety of musicians, and musical styles, the music retains its innate style from Celtic roots."
5,5+5 powerfull,"the most powerful stuff ive heard. in my opinion it is strong as the delta blues, it rock and rolls more than our rock and roll ((in most places)) on this cd.if you like heavy Rock(60's-90). give this a listen with favoraite alchahol.i hope you the best nose bleed."
5,"Marvelous, soulful variety!","I've owned this CD for some time and enjoyed its wonderful variety. As usual, the Chieftains, Paddy Mahoney et al, do not disappoint. This time they incorporate their versatility with some Top Flight members of the musical community. The results are engaging, fun, uplifting and melancholy in turns, as all good Celtic musical efforts should be. The fiddle, the pipes, and the tin whistle uproariously abound and distinguish themselves proudly in this masterful work.I heartily recommend it to all Chieftains fans; any good music fan for that matter!"
5,"Lots of variety, lots of fun","This is overall a brilliant collaboration. Strangely enough, some of the most offbeat songs on here are the best...Tom Jones, the Stones, Mick Jagger. But the song on here that never fails to floor me is Sinead O'Connor's ""He Moved thru the Fair"", accompanied by the barest twiddle of flute and strings."
4,Botanica is a band,"It's easy to dismiss this band as a collection of hired guns. Paul Wallfisch spends time with Firewater, Kid Congo's been in plenty of bands, and Abby Travis has toured with Beck and KMFDM; however, this is no project thrown together during everybody's down time. It's a tight as hell, sad and groovey masterpiece. Botanica will apppeal to any fans of Nick Cave, The Tindersticks, or Scott Walker.Malediction is dark without being maudlin which is a tricky gambit to pull off. This is what the goth scene should be listening to: depression that sips cocktails and smirks at you instead of painting its face and hiding behind a wall of dyed black hair.This is the sound of style in New York."
5,Like your favorite Jim Jarmush movie......,"and some kind of sick revival meeting on hollywood boulevard...plus rem, souxsie and the banshees, daniel dax, nick cave, abba, tom waits and james brown--all mixing it up for you. this is real and good. see what bohemia is really all about... delete that ben folds 5 cd and buy this. Perfect gift for the audiophile!"
2,Botanica's 'Malediction',"Reading the reviews of this cd made me think I had found my new favorite band... I was sadly mistaken. Botanica's frontman should get some singing lessons or hire another lead singer before he puts out another album. I was surprised by the 'pop-iness' of this album considering the other reviews I read here. Although it's not terrible, it's certainly not going to get many more plays by me. If you are still interested, I would reccommend buying a cheap used cd from one of the other sellers; this album isn't worth retail."
4,Sister-in-law gift,She asked for this specifically as she had heard it was good. She started reading Christmas night and said it was what she needed and was good for her.
2,Inspiring only for the right kind of personality...,"This book made its way around my company. I fear that part of its attractiveness is the fact that it is so thin. I think that for the right kind of personality, this book is inspiring. I could see giving this to a person who perhaps needed a self-esteem boost or was trying to define their self-worth. However, there are just not enough common themes to resonate as a development guide for everyone. I lost patience with some of the long-winded passages; for example, there is one where the author relays an entire conversation with someone which could be an insightful tool but in this case it felt like filler. The book also plays into the current trend of parable-style books which is becoming trite. In this case, its cutesy visuals using circles as metaphors becomes tired and makes the book feel as if it is not quite aimed at an adult audience."
2,Too much psychobabble,The Nibble Theory has some interesting illustrations. And it's central point - about the uniqueness and value of each individual - resonates with western cultural values. But the book is long on psychobabble and short on provocative insight. 80 pages could be better used by a clearer presentation of new ideas.
2,Is not worth the trouble,Turn out to be uncomfortable to wear for any length of time and broke down after a short period of time. I cannot recommend it.
1,Piece of junk,"Maybe if you had JUST the right shape of ears, this would be a usable headset. It's certainly small and light, which is what I was looking for. However, it's quite unusable - there's no adjustment possible at all, since it's just a hard lump of plastic, with a little plastic cone that's supposed to somehow fit into your ear. If I press it in, I can sort of hear things (though it still doesn't sound great), but it doesn't stay put at all on its own. On top of that, the microphone has a horrible hiss to it.I was really disappointed, since a small, cheap headset like this was just what I was looking for - but now I'm still looking. Avoid this one."
2,mediocre,"The part that is supposed to hold the earpiece behind our ear doesn't really do that. In addition to that, the sound also isn't the best.Mediocre piece of equipment, at best. I do not recommend it."
2,Worked for a while ... then fell apart,"I purchased this headset for my laptop -- I travel all the time and this was always packed away in my laptop case or luggage. Within one month the cord for the headphone portion no longer worked and had broken/frayed SO I used the mic alone and my computer speakers. The microphone cord started giving me problems 14 days later, and the earpiece lost its ""grip"" and the mic would slip down all the time. By month 2 this product was completely useless. My coworker purchased the same product and didn't have problems as quickly as I did (which is why I gave it 2 stars and not 1) - so perhaps the moral of the story is this is NOT a headset consistent in quality. My traveling might have had something to do with wear and tear, but in such a short period that shouldn't be the case. Better to spend your money on another product."
3,Not what i thought it would be,"This item was not exactly what i thought it would be, i was looking for something with a usb part and it didnt have that. i thought it did. that was the only issue with this item. packaging was great and all the other things too."
2,Returned the next day,"I bought this at Bestbuy since I got into using skype being a night owl and with thin walls I don't want to wake anyone us with my speakers and my loud talking since my laptop mics are integrated at the top of the screen which I was told had an irritating on and off buzzing. First off There is no ear bud, to rubber padding no nothing to actually keep the thing in your ear, it's just a plastic cone with a hole in it. I need glasses at all times and I expect problems now and then with any product that loops onto your ear, this is the first item in 10 years wearing them. It's flexible yes but doesn't stay well, it has no grip, and I had to put it back on my ear every few minutes cause with no bud it was the only thing keeping it in place. Because it was never actually in my ear my computer and it's volume were all the way up for me to hear and it wasn't great.The only positive was the mic. It wasn't worth the money, returned it the next day and am looking for a better product."
1,Consistent performance ...,".. it stunk on every machine I tried it on. With the microphone boost off, it would barely pick up my voice. With the boost on, there was a constant buzzing noise. If you held the mic right in front of your mouth it appeared to work better, but then the earpiece wasn't near your ear.My headset is different than the one pictured. It has a cloth covered pad for the earpiece instead of the earbud mentioned in other reviews. The stiff plastic ear-wrap is barely tolerable.The sound was acceptable for a headset this cheap. No need to point out it's made in China, every headset I've looked at is."
3,decent,"good price, however you get what you pay for.The mic works great, but the speaker is poor, and cuts out often.The fit is uncomfortable and does not stay on easy"
4,Mobile Gear Review,What's Up?This product is a great addition and arsenol for the Dee Jay. Specifically the Beginner and continuing Dee Jay. The price is economical and it provides a couple of features that are very useful and prepatory for the Dee Jay. It has two back openings in the rear of the center rack that let you wire your equipment. It also has a good cover lock mechanism so mobility is safe and easy. An A+++ product from Oddesey Dee Jay Gear!
4,replacement battery for Sony A100,"I have no complaints on this battery, it held up well and recharged fast.i am more then happy with my purchase."
1,Lousy charge and short life,"This battery does NOT last worth a you-know-what. Put it in the Dremel and you have about 5 VERY short minutes of charge before it peters out. It takes another hour or more to charge fully, and then after about 20 charges, your battery is toast. Honestly, if I had researched this Dremel and knew how short the battery life was, I would have bought a corded one, and saved myself money in the long run! YOU SHOULD TOO!!"
1,Bad contact pads.,"I have been in desperate need of a replacement battery for my Dremel which I primarily use to do my dogs nails. I was extremely disappointed after receiving my new battery and charging it that when I connected the battery, the contact pads were so bad that I have to hold the battery firmly against the Dremel in order for it to work. Now I am the proud owner of another non functional Dremel Battery!"
3,DREMEL BATTERY,I needed a battery replacement. Battery had short recharging life. I ordered two batteries so as to always have a charged battery. Ordering two qualified for free shipping.
2,Extra Battery,"This new spare battery did not fit into my new Dremel 4.8V Cordless Model #754 unit.I had to grind and sand down the plastic-type prongs so it would go in and out of the unit easy. Then I have to add a bit of ""3-N-One"" oil to its' sides.... da! da! da!.So much for stuff ""MADE IN CHINA."""
1,Poor battery life,"I bought this battery to replace the battery that came with my Dremel. I used this to grind down my dog's nails less than a dozen times, and the battery no longer holds a solid charge as when first purchase. Additionally, I have to charge the battery overnight for it to hold a decent charge. Needless to say, I ended up purchasing a corded version of my Dremel as the batteries obviously have power and charge holding issues."
2,Poor battery life,"I have bought 3 of these batteries so far. Each one has only lasted 8-9 months which gets expensive at $15-20 a pop - and I've only used each one less than a dozen times. I'm planning on trying a corded grinder hoping it will last longer. The ones I'm looking at cost more but with the amount I've spent on replacement batteries so far, it would have paid for a corded model plus some."
3,Why can't they make a better battery?,"I purchased a dremel years ago for my dogs nails and although I love it, I hate the short life of the battery. There is barely enough life fully charged to do all her nails. For about 9.00 more you can purchase a brand new dremel that comes with the battery.[...]Unfortunately I have been unable to find a battery for less than the 15.00 advertised here on amazon.com"
5,Lola,"I tried to purchase the extra battery pack when I had purchased the Dremel Tool, but it was not a stock item and could not be ordered through the store. I searched for quite awhile before I found the battery on your website. Thank you, the price was right and the service was great. 5 stars for product and 5 stars for service."
1,Rippable Tearable shoes!,Do not buy these shoes unless your just starting to skateboard. Otherwise just stay away. I got these when they just came out and boy was that a mistake. After your first couple ollies or kickflips you can already tell theres signs of ripping. I ripped a hole right to my foot in about 6 weeks. I'm not going to recomend this shoe to anyone.
3,OK but not what I hoped for,"I like to hear choirs sing hymns and had an old audio cassette I was trying to replace so I bought this. This sounds, to me, more like elevator music versions of hymns. Not really bad, but not the same reverence as I am used to hearing from a soloist or choir. I'll keep up my search."
1,I had to eat it,"It worked with Windows XP but wasn't compatable with Windows 7. I ended up purchasing a new all in one printer, so I ate this one. PS got no help from the mfg."
2,Shouldabeenbetter,"After a strong debut on BEC Recordings (""Armageddon Massive""), this Orange County-based ska-punk band had a path to follow. But rather than improving on the Ramones / Sublime / Sex Pistol-ish sound, this follow-up album just meanders all over boring. There's nothing new here, but that doesn't mean it's terrible; the last five songs are worth hearing, and the best five on the disc. If you want to know what the Dingees could do at a splendored young age, then I highly recommend the previous effort."
5,Haven't used it yet!,"But looking forward to it! The device was easy to set up and install. It has a green indicator light. That's what I needed, one more green indicator light! Can't wait to get my camera out of ""The shop"" (the pawn shop) so I can try this thing. I didn't think ahead I should have bought one that reads and writes to the cards but I was thinking price instead of features."
4,A good buy.,"This knife was chosen for the Special Forces Cold Weather Survival Knife. I own one, from day one very sharp, takes and holds a fine edge. I used it to slice and saw in desert hardwoods, no problem! Mesquite cuts easily, pine like soft butter! It works excellently for what I got it for, and I don't think it would be easy to destroy."
5,Available for film work!,"I was also a pupil at this school during the time the book is set and Mike James was a good and honourable teacher and one of about two or three members of the staff who didn't live with thier heads up their ..., he was a decent guy and did not deserve to be put through this ordeal. ... the school for their judgement and ... the beady eyes of the Deputy Head, for he was a fool. I would also like to wish the author the best of luck in the future. And to Simon Garofalo who wrote the review below - YEEEEE. JDG"
4,Excellent Toy for kids and not so young too,"this product is created to offer a great deal of fun & enjoyment, I recomend this for kids from 6yrs old upt 60 years old kids."
4,Great mixes from the oldskool!,"I grew up listening to TTD as a child. Songs like SIGN YOUR NAME and WISHING WELL. I got this collection to recapture apart of the past. It's good to have these and many classics on one CD. TTD is a beautiful man,with beautiful talent!"
4,"So far, so good!","I ordered this for my wife about 2 months ago. She uses it at least 5-6 days a week and so far it works well. The removable comb helps her guide the straightening iron through her hair. Previously, she had a HAI Nano XT ($120) and it worked wonderfully for 2 years before it stopped heating up. Let's see how long this one will last."
2,does not work as good as i thought it would,"This product does not work on my hair or my daughters hair as well as i thought it would. It does not seem to straighten it beyond a wave. My hair is not curly, it is only wavy, so i figured it would actually straighten my hair, but the performance is just not there.We are not satified with this product."
5,great product for economic price,"The product meets the requirements of a nice hair iron straightener. The best part is it has dual voltage so it can be used worldwide. I purchased this for my sister abroad. I hope its still working since I have not heard any comment. My first order was lost in shipment, but Amazon customer service send me another one without extra charge right away. So I am glad with my purchase."
3,Decent straightening Iron,"This Straightening Iron works well on my long thick hair..heats up fast and is hot enough.. My only complaint is, the adjustment knob for temperature is hard to reach, and the numbers are hard to see, too small."
4,Good Product,"Heats up quickly. Arrived quickly. Easy to use, seems to have a tiny safety edge. The price is excellent. I'm sure it's as good at the more expensive ceramic brands."
4,Works wonderful,"this is the first straightening iron I ever purchased...never really started using one until recently when I tried my friends. I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on my first, so I went with this one based on reviews. It is great...gets nice and hot and straightens my hair great. I have thick, wavy hair and it does a wonderful job. Very happy with my choice."
4,works good,"I like the Babyliss Pro 1 1/2 inch iron but I'm finding I like my daughter's 1 inch Babyliss one better. I like working with smaller sections of hair and the 1 inch seems less bulky to handle and much lighter. The 1 1/2in iron works good, heats up fast, is very sturdy but the temp dial is hard to read. The numbers are written SO small that I have to get readers out to see what temp it is set at. I just keep it at one setting and seldom adjust it."
2,Left Hair dry and brittle,"I have fine, thin, with little wavy hair (so I need little straightening) and even with the temperature control this straightener left my hair dry and brittle. My hair was frizzy and looked awful after using this for just one day. I did give it another chance and got the same result ... It definitely got my hair straight but also made it look really bad ... I returned it."
3,not great,"This is the first flat iron I've bought and I was not impressed. I have wavy hair and while the iron does straighten it somewhat, it still leaves my hair wavy. It definitely doesn't leave my hair shiny and it does seem to damage it, making it look dull and dry even though I use a spray made for flat irons to protect my hair."
4,MAGNIFICENT BABYLISSSSSSSSSS,"This is my wifes reaction to the BABYLISS PRO BAB2590:After waiting, researching and keeping an eye on the different ceramic irons, I finally chose Babyliss. For a long time I wanted the TURBO CHI but the prices were still outrageous. Sure it might live up to all the hype but it is still way up there in pricing. Well after a few months of searching finally I found the BABYLISS PRO BAB2590 and it is fabulous! I have had an older Professional Luxor and sure it works but didn't quite get hot fast enough. I have very curly hair and don't care to spend a long time in getting it all straightened. The first time I used BABYLISS....OMG...IT HEATED IMMEDIATELY & IT STRAIGHTED IT RIGHT AWAY. I DID NOT BLOW DRY FIRST EITHER. My niece loved it as well and is asking for one for Christmas. All I can say is THANK YOU BABYLISS!!!!"
1,not worth it,I have VERY long and thick hair. I already have a straightening iron that was quite expensive. It just has a much smaller plate. So because I got the curling iron of this brand I figured I'd try the wider plate straightening iron. So not worth it. Not only did it not work very well on my hair but the notch on the inside pulled my hair out like mad! It hurt like heck and didn't do anything for my hair. I've already sent it back for a refund.
5,awesome product,this is a great product. It heats up very fast has a temp control that's awesome. I've had many other straightners none compare to this one.
5,Awsome!,I should have bought 2!! this is the best straightener i have ever owned! I love the attached comb on it.
4,it works fine and gets warm quickly.,"It gets warm really fast I like it. but sometimes my hair get stacked into gaps in the straightener. till now, it didn't burn my hair but not to burn your hair make sure that you use the correct temperature. I recommend it."
5,Great Iron,The Babyliss pro bab2590 is a wonderful iron at a reasonable price. It works great to straighten my wavy hair. I was able to get my hair straight without having to blow dry my hair. It heats us very well. My only wish would be that it had a kind of locking stitch like my other iron. But overall I highly recommend this product and the selling shipping it quickly.
4,BaByliss Flat Iron,"It took some getting use to this product because it had a wider flattening surface than i had used before, but now that i've used it a few times and adjusted the heat, i love it."
3,Quick heating,"The babyliss pro ceramic straightening iron heats up very quickly, but it also gives a frizzy, burnt look to the hair"
2,It died,I liked this flat iron for a while.. but I bought in July 2012 and it died in December 2012. I've gone through several flat irons over the last 10 years or so and they all seem to break at some point. But I tried Babyliss thinking it was a good brand - I did not expect it to die after only 5 months. It turns on now - I see the light - but it does not heat up. I am now going to invest in a more expensive flat iron so hopefully I don't have to buy a new one so often.
1,I know now why it was so cheap,"This straightener is not good by any stretch. I am a babyliss fan, and this one was terrible! spend an extra $20-$30 and get one that works well!!!"
4,Amazing... but,"I was very surprised by the quality of this flat iron, especially by the low price. I have very curly hair that snarls and can be unmanageably hard to style. I like the fact there is a comb, which is very helpful if you have curly hair. I am only giving it 4 stars as there needs to be a comb on both sides of the iron so it will do a better job to go through the hair and iron better."
2,Doesnt Hold HEAT,I just want to say that I bought this because it was the Porcelain Ceramic I was looking for so I orderd it it had the sleek look not to bulky as some are an how ever I was attempting to do my daughter hair with it an the HEAT SUCKS on it it doesnt get as HOT as it says it does I would'nt order this if you want the stlye of shine an flow this is not the ONE for hair
3,Ok product,"After reading the reviews I thought I was getting something fantastic.You get what you pay for. This flat iron is just like any other regular ones. No magic, no tricks, nothing special.Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad product but far far away to be a 5 stars iron."
4,Love it!,"I never spend a lot of $$ on flat irons, hair dryers or anything else but when my flat iron went out I HAD to get another one and fast. I asked my friend who is a hair stylist what she could recommend and she told me about BaByliss products so I ordered this one and I love it. Heats up super fast which is great for me in the mornings becasue I love to sleep in till the last min. :)Took quite awhile for me to receive the product though since they were out of stock but glad it finally came. I would absolutely recommend this product!"
1,BEWARE OF SELLER & PRODUCTS,"The same day i received this product, i plugged it in for 1st use. I smelled plastic burning so i unplugged it and saw that the plastic had melted over the plates. It was completely defective. I contacted the seller and he insisted that i replaced the new one he sent me with one i had already owned. He emailed me a few very vulgar nasty emails so i filed a complaint with amazon and am still awaiting a refund!"
2,Maybe just not for me,"My daughter has long thick hair, it kept grabbing her hair and it smells like it is burning.I bought two of them, we aren't using either of them."
1,"Plastic began melting 10 minutes into first use, comb pulls your hair out.","I decided to order this flat iron based on the good reputation of the brand that I had heard about. I received it on 12/6 but never used it until last night,12/21 after wrapping some gifts I decided to treat myself by flat ironing my hair which I only do in the winter. I set the temperature between 390 and 420 and after about ten minutes of using the flat iron (and getting my hair pulled out buy the comb on the flat iron), I began to smell something that smelled a little off I looked at the flat iron and plastic around the plates were melting. I slid my fingers over the hair that had been straightened and looked at them. They were covered in black and sliver almost flakes."
3,I purchased it March 2011. It just died,"It was a good flat iron while it lasted. It probably would have died quicker if I used it more often. I may have used it a couple times a week, if that. I only used it to tame fly away hair so probably had it on for 5 min a use. It worked great each time - until I turned it on today. It got comfortably warm to the touch and than it cooled down. Done. Kaput. Tried it again this evening just to make sure. Didn't even get warm."
4,Good information,"This is a book of collected essays by several authors, including the famous Ian Kershaw, that features some very good information. The book deals with several aspects of life within Nazi Germany including how the Nazis came to power, youth, the ""Hitler myth"", the policy against the Jews, and the way the Nazi state was run. The differing installments are well-written, and although some parts can be dry this book is a good introduction to what daily life was like within the Reich."
5,Best all-purpose scrubbers!!!,"I have used these scrubbers without any heavy duty cleaners on fiberglass tubs to remove soap scum, ceramic tile floors to remove hairspray, stainless steel kitchen sink to remove coffee and tea stains, pots and pans and the list goes on! They are all purpose and work great especially for those who do not like to use chemical cleaners! Also great on lime and rust removal!"
4,Ramey the Great,"Sam's voice was so clear and rounded,placed perfectly.His acting you can't ask for any more.Fabulous!!!!My biggest surprise was Ms.Studer.I remember her only once before and never knew what happened to her after her Met debut.She was very good.Ofcourse this performance has Riccardo Muti genius in it what can you say.If you haven't seen it or heard it do yourself a favour"
4,An epic performance,"This is an outstanding performance: well-staged, acted, and musically very satisfying. I didn't know what to expect, other than a lesser-known Verdi opera, and found it engaging and moving. It deserves to more popular. Samuel Ramey in the title role is as always a thrilling presence with a magnificent voice. Note: Having lived for awhile in Hungary, I learned that Attila is hardly seen as a barbarian but a national hero. Many name their boys after him (accent on the 1st syllable, BTW)."
4,entertaining,"Bewitched was different from everything I've read. It was cute, entertaining, really funny in places and was different from most books that were out. I don't usually read anything with witches in them, but this was cute and no evil was anywhere in this book. So that kind of surprised me."
4,Charming,"A sweet romance novel that had me chuckling, as well as rooting for the heroine (the witch) and the gruff Duke. I loved the tale, which wove a charming story and developed characters one cared about. After reading so many romance novels, here was one a little different. Fun and romantic."
5,Delightful,"When I think of magic, it's the laughter of children at play, or the lullaby a grandmother croons to soothe a crying baby. It's also in the eyes of a loving husband and wife who revel in their devotion to one another and in what they've created together. An excellent book with lots of magic."
3,Alec Was Such An Jerk!,This was a cute story to me Alec is The Duke of Belmore who has lived his whole life based on getting his Father's approval. He doesn't know anything about kindness or love thus making him such a jerk to everyone. Alec's life has been pretty boring and predictable but that all changes when Joyous enters into his life. Nothing is ever the same and predictability is thrown out of the window! Alex was such a jerk and he made me mad more times than I want to count he was so mean to Joyous and hurt her feelings so many times that I wanted to choke him! But you learn in the book how can one show another what they were never taught or given? To me this book was worth the money and the time I don't think you will regret getting the book. Hope this review aids you in your final decision to purchase the book ;)
3,harlequin with humor,"I only gave it 3 stars simply because I loathe Harlequin type books. This is mostly Harlequin style. If you like that, then you'll love this. For those of you like me who do not enjoy those type books, the underlying story is quite funny and filled with adventure. ""Oh Lord, what could possibly happen next?!"" is a question you'll find yourself asking between spurts of laughter. It was fairly easy for me to frequently skip past the three pages describing a kiss (or some other bit of romantic nonsense) to get to the heart, if you'll pardon the pun, of the main story. I liked it, and it was fun, but in my opinion not worthy of more than the three stars I gave it."
4,Surprisingly fun romantic read,"I don't read a lot of romance books- I prefer a bit less steamy sex scenes. But I enjoyed Jill Barnett's writing style and the characters were engaging and fun. I enjoyed the magic and wonder of a simple, yet intelligent young woman's viewpoint clashing with a very tightly-wound autocratic male's view. There is humor, love, and heartbreak. Nice little read to make you feel great about rose petals, happy endings, and magical young ladies."
5,Jill Barnett creates magical moments!,"BEWITCHING sparkles with fun, romance and magic. Alec and Joy are a magnificent couple. She's so adorable as the inept witch and he's the brooding hero. She loves him, charms him, and makes his life worth living. The rose petals- what a lovely, imaginative touch to the romance scenes! And the ending? Sure it was a little hoaky - but in her introduction, Barnett says that she used to hang her hair out the window like Rapunzel, she married her first true love - would an author like that NOT give you and ending truly worth the words ""happily ever after""? The romance genre is, after all, the ultimate escapism! I used to think no one could equal Julie Garwood and Judith McNaught as the best romance writers but I have added 4 new ones to my list: Jill Barnett (BEWITCHING, WILD); Jillian Hunter (FAIRY TALE); Jo Beverley (FORBIDDEN MAGIC) and Mary Balogh (THIEF OF DREAMS) Bravo! All these books are worth reading - at least several times!!"
2,Could't Finish It,"I am a huge fan of paranormal romance, and after seeing the rave reviews, I held off on reading it until I knew that my schedule would allow for a wonderful reading treat. What a dissapointment! The story starts out interesting enough, but goes nowhere. The heroine is entirely too sweet, perky, and naive, and tends to thrive on emotional abuse. The hero (a zero in my book), is an emotionless, cardboard snob that is almost impossible to like or even identify with. The plot is practically non-existant. Believe it or not, I ALMOST finished it before I realized that it was taking me twice as long to read as other books. Since I have a huge collection of more promising books to read, I decided to end my suffering and move on."
5,An enchanting love story!,"This is a funny and romantic tale with just the right amount of ""steamy."" The characters were delightful and believable. The magic was charming and funny. And it was nice to read a love story without so much angst getting in the way. Yes, there was conflict, but it was so entertaining that I didn't find myself getting frustrated. This was my first read by this author, but I'm on to the second one now. I can only hope it's as good as the first."
2,A badly padded and slow-moving story,"I find this book most disappointing. The story is flimsy ,drags terribly and stretches my patience. You will only like this book if you like your heroine to be silly, childish and dim-witted which is exactly what Joy is like in this story.Her silly prattle is irritating and her inability to comprehend why her husband keeps telling her not to use magic or they may suffer dire consequences if she is discovered by the ton to be a witch is infuriating.The trouble is that she is such an inept witch that her spells go awry more often than not and bring havocs. There is nothing I like about the heroine and the way she lets her ermine eat away the footman's hair is reprehensible.She might be the Duchess, the animal her pet and he the servant. But this kind of exploitation of hired help is another quality of her that turns me off."
3,"Hopeless heroine, horrid hero","Our heroine, the Scottish witch Joyous MacQuarrie, is a loser at everything she attempts. She stinks at witchcraft, can't cast a spell to save her life. And I found her pathetic. Whoopee she was an eternal optimist that smiled a lot. But I kind of thought of a fool everytime I pictured her. A silly, ""Ramling Rose"" kind of fool. I became very frustrated that she was good at nothing and no job she ever attempted worked out right. The Duke of Belmore was nothing I would have fallen in love with either that's for sure.In the end, Stephen saved the story. Somehow his reveal saved the tale.The lovestory itself ended predictably, but satisfyingly.I think overall this protagonist just wasn't my cup of tea.I will heartily applaud Barnett for the pink roses thing, Beezle (hated the hair eating tho), tree-hugging, and the dancing statues on the roof. Wonderful!"
2,Looking For A Funny Read?,"The review's I read make this sound like a fun read, but I can only thank the gods I bought it on Kindle's ""Deal of The Day"" instead of full price. This may be the first book I delete, it was very silly."
2,Not For Young Adults,This is not a young adult book. It has explicit sexual scenes that could have and should have been left out. When you read the description of the book you think it will be like the television show bewitched that is set in the late 1700's. I thought it would be a romantic comedy. There were some funny parts when she messed up her magic but the sex scenes were too much. I am always looking for books that my daughter can read and this is definitely not one for any young teen or preteen.
4,funny,I enjoyed this book the characters are funny and I feel really sorry for the Duke he is trying so hard to keep magic a secret.
5,Bewitching (Barnett),"I loved this book! It's a sweet, funny, sexy, sometimes heart-tugging, historical romance, with a touch of magic.Our main man, Alec, drove me crazy. One minute I wanted to hug him, and the next minute I wanted to strangle him. Joy was absolutely adorable. She tried so hard to manage her witchcraft, but even I cringed when she attempted a new spell. The rest of the cast, including the animals, are a riot. I do not have the words to describe the rose petals, other than it was the most romantic thing I have ever read!Jill Barnett has become one of my favorite authors. She really brings her stories to life, with nicely drawn settings, colorful characters, and great endings. As soon as I finished this book, I downloaded the sequel, ""Dreaming"". I can't wait to read the story of Richard and the infamous Letitia Hornsby!"
3,Surprise Romance novel,"I guess I didn't look at the description close enough, I usually don't read romance novels. I guess it's a good thing that it didn't seem like a ""sexy"" novel until the first infamous ""scene"". By then I was hooked. The ending was a bit disappointing however. Like the author had to end it all of a sudden."
3,"C+, Cute","If I were a fan of historical novels, this would have gotten bumped up a grade.It's very cute. The story is adorable. The plot line is different than most of what I come across.Jill, the protagonist is a bubbly, innocent, spitfire. Alec is a brooding, practical, nobleman.Throw in few humorous episodes and you get this.Would have been funnier had she accidentally exploded some elves. But I digress. That's just my twisted side.Cute, historical novel."
4,great read...,"Wow what a complete suprise! For once I didn't feel as if I was having deja vu while reading a romance novel.The story was original, and the romance was great. This has become one of my favorite books which considering its genre say's alot for this book. Please read if your looking for something original whithin the romance section!"
3,"A cute story, but not a keeper..(3 3/4 stars)","""Bewitching"" was a sweet book. I absolutely loved Joy. She was extremely likable and good hearted. I will say that I had a problem connecting with Alec. I just couldnt see what Joy saw in him..he was rude so often..I did soften a bit towards him as the story went on, but I just couldnt 100% love him. I also felt that the character of Stephen felt a bit forced and thrown in just to give Alec a reason to ""see the light"" so to speak. All in all a fun book, but not one Ill take take to the isle."
2,Drags,I really tried to like this book. I really did but after a week and I'm only 45% I just can't take it anymore. It's a great story line but nothing to give it the extra push to keep me interested
4,Magic,I really enjoyed this book. It was very refreshing and magical. It almost had me believing in magic. This book was very humerous and enjoyable. It made me laugh and I loved the surprise at the ending. If you want to get away from the tension of the world and step into fantasy land this is the book to read. It was great and it kept my interest through out the entire story. However it was not a book that I stayed up all night glued to the pages. It was a fun read and I loved the characters.
5,Enchanting!,"I loved this delightful tale of an unworldly and woefully inept witch and a dour duke. But then I'm a sucker for Beauty and the Beast type stories anyway. What I'm not an avid follower of is paranormal, the dark seamy stuff. Jill Barnett's Bewitching is as far from that as can be, in spite of heartstopping mistakes and English pigheadedness (on the part of the duke, of course!)You'll love Joyous and, eventually, Alec, ""her Alec."" Treat yourself to an emotional ride with a most satisfactory ending!"
2,Pass on this foolishness...,"Let me just say I love books that have magical themes and involve witches, etc.,. This was well written and some of the situations are truly humorous, but the book was just not well plotted and the characters were beyond foolish. Oddly enough if the element of magic were removed from this book it probably would have been better (a country bumpkin, fish out of water type story, not original but it still can be done well). The heroine is just an idiot, and NOT charming as I suppose she was intended to be. I finally gave up on her when she accepts a sleigh ride as an apology for a terrible affront from the hero. He is not much better. All in all, not a great book for fans of Barnett."
4,Intriguing,"Richter was very intriguing. I like him for being unique. His playing here is wonderful, and I particularly like seeing him playing the ""Winter Wind"" Etude of Chopin with the cameras filming from above. It's hard to see him playing the Mozart Sonatas since he insisted on playing in the dark with only a small light beside him. Don't hesitate to get this one, but prepare to be a bit frustrated by seeing him playing in the dark."
4,Richter,"The cons were appropriately explained, i.e., limited visual exposure of the artist, the quality of the sound, the forced fragmented editing of the pieces."
3,Music,"Great music, but difficult to play. You must que each selection. You can not put it in a changer."
1,Best to look to another brand,"We've had the same set with Christmas colors for three years. After the first year, the ""whistle"" unit (housed in the tender) no longer worked. And about 10 minutes into running the second year, the engine stopped. Found that the engine was wired so that the power wire was rubbing a drive wheel.The engine is built with an underpowered motor, such that a fairly high power setting is required to get it moving and then it runs fast; there is only a tiny operating range before it will fly off on a curve. The engine is very top heavy and the curves have a tight radius to them. Finally, when taking the entire engine apart this year found the plastic gears flimsy, badly supported and worn even with recommended oiling.I still have some of my fathers Lionel trains and these can still be counted on to run today; the new stuff being sold is meant to be in the trash quickly."
4,DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER,"I purchased this item off of Amazon last night as a Christmas present. I got a confirmation from Amazon, only to get a follow-up e-mail from the seller. It has been backordered to the 21st. These things happen. So, I called to see if there was some way I could pick it up, get it overnighted (buy something similar, etc. I was told that it was my fault for buying through Amazon rather than their site. (The woman was also incredibly rude). I was also told that they would do nothing to be helpful and that if I wanted help I could go to Amazon. I have purchased many things from Amazon sellers and I understand that things happen around Christmas time. But, to be told, essentially, that Amazon purchasers are not welcome is unacceptable. I will check to make sure that this seller never offers something I am going to purchase."
1,You get what you pay for.,The battery I purchased will not hold a full charge. My camera reads it at 60%. Tried to contact the seller to replace but got no response.
1,dissapointed,"purchased the DB-ENEL3E by CTA as a less expensive alternative for NIKON EN-EL3E battery for my NIKON 300S. Chose this battery as a middle of the road alternative, as less expensive batteries are available.CHARGED battery upon opening, as it was not fully charged, as indicated by the battery charger. Placed in camera next morning, after seeing a fully charged sign on the charger and received a low battery message immediately from the camera.I would not recommend this product."
1,do not buy this item,they claim this battatry work with nikon d80 the camera did not turn on nothing at all its waste of time and mony to buy it
3,Probably works well for cameras other than D90,"I purchased this planning to use it for my Nikon D90. No luck. Doesn't recognize it. Worked with my brothers D80 though. Not sure about the battery life, probably works well."
3,why pay more?,"I have only used recharged the battery once, but it appears to work as well as the original Nikon battery. However, the real test will be with repeated recharges, so the jury is still out."
3,Didn't work in D300,"This battery is advertised as an EN-EL3E replacement, but it won't work in my D300. It appears to charge OK in the D300 charger, and I can measure proper voltage across the terminals, but the D300 just shows the low battery symbol when it's inserted. A Google search for ""D300 generic battery"" turns up similar stories. I'm returning it for a Nikon brand.This battery is probably fine in the other cameras specifically listed in the description."
3,"NOT ""freshwater"" fish as I know them to be","My two sons love to fish with daddy. We live in New England, and they catch a lot of bass and basic bluegill. I was hoping these placemats would offer an insight into identifying more of the local fish from the lakes, but instead, they are all brightly colored fish that can't really be caught in our area. I think perhaps this is a good tool for other areas, maybe Southern?? But even then, I'm not sure. I'm keeping them because they were inexpensive and they will still use them. They just won't get the info out of them that I was hoping for."
3,chain should have been little more thick,i was expecting little more. not 100% satisfied. Not sure how stong it is. i dont want to test it anyway.
3,Its ok,"The pendant is small, i am not sure if it is real sterling silver.....it looks weird. I am a little bit dissapointed"
1,Crappy chain,"I was very excited to get the necklace because it had decent reviews and the price was perfect. I put it on as soon as I got it a gave a slight pull on the chain to make sure it was on and it immediately broke! It is very disappointing, especially because I was planning on wearing with with my husbands dog tags while he deploys! The heart pendant itself is cute, but now I have to go buy another chain!"
4,great for the price,the chain was a bit flimsy but otherwise a great purchase for the price. I bought this for my teen age daughter and she loved it.
3,nice item,This was purchased as a birthday gift for one of my daughter's friends. It was a nice gift for a teen girl. The chain is very fragile but the product looks nice.
5,Ryan's Room Dollhouse Furniture,"My toddler loves her ""house"" and all of it's furniture. Ryan's Room products seem to be very durable and well made, simple and cute. We just boxed up the smaller pieces until she is less likely to swallow the,. I believe these toys will last for years."
5,Very Pleased,"I just received several Ryan's Room sets. All are a beautiful, natural wood with a high level of craftsmanship and seeming durability. My only complaint about this set is that the ""bedspread"" is so packed with poly batting that it has more of a body-pillow shape than anything resembling a flat blanket. The dolls have to carefully be placed on top and not bumped or they will roll off the curvature of the ""bedspread"". So, I took some craft felt and cut little sheets and blankets which could also be made of cotton quilter's fabric when I have the time. And, now we have floor cushions or body pillows for a daybed effect. Other than that, it's a great little set with miniature toys."
5,Keyboard: Made for MAC but works great with PC too,"Support many elderly friends with PC use and training. Needed white keyboard for 80+ person with limited vision. After getting a black keyboard (when I had ordered white) elsewhere and having to return, found this one at Amazon. My client is happy, and it was no stretch for him to use the key marked with Apple's command symbol as the Windows key normally on a PC keyboard. Pros: It is attractive, sturdily made, compact, and quiet. Plus, the black lettering on the white background is just what he needed to make using his computer fun again. Cons: The Apple 1-button mouse lacks the right button, so was not useful for this client."
5,Been a long time coming,"I've been using Microsoft mice and keyboards for a long time because of convenience/price considerations, so it was a pleasure to return to a mac-styled keyboard/mouse combo from Macally. It just feels right and works smoothly with my old workhorse Power PPC dual. Been using Macs since 1986 so I know the diff."
2,USB Ports Do Not Draw Enough Power,"I purchased this keyboard set when a spilled cocktail took my Apple keyboard out of commission and I didn't want to pay $50 to replace it. This, though it lacks the aesthetic qualities of newer keyboards, is a perfectly fine replacement EXCEPT for one thing: the USB ports on the keyboard don't draw enough power for an iPod to function (sync, charge, transfer music). They also don't draw enough power for my USB scanner to function. Since the existence of USB ports on this keyboard was one of the major reasons I chose it over other options (I was also considering wireless keyboards, most of which don't have built-in USB ports), this is a major letdown. I will probably keep it, out of sheer laziness, but be warned that the USB ports here are effectively useless."
5,"New Vision, New Ideas, New Method",This book does not reduce the complexity of the finance to the laws of the physics. Ilinski offers a new vision of the finance based on the method of physics. Without doubt a great triumph for the gauge theory of all things.
4,A delight,"I agree with the reviewer below that maybe Lacy himself is a shade more intense on ""Bye-Ya."" But drummer John Betsch just kills on this CD, and, for those who don't get a chance to hear the Lacy trio in person, this unedited live show is a joy. Lacy even sings the lyric of his song ""Bone""!"
3,7mm Slim DVD (100 Pk),Package arrived intact and fast. What more can i say it's a bunch of empty slim dvd cases....it does what it is supposed to...hold dvd's.
2,Disappointing Quality,"I ordered two boxes. One box of 100 was just fine. The other box contained highly defective product. Out of the second box of 100, 19 of them ripped when I tried to open them, and an additional 8 of them lacked part of the spine, totaling 27. Additionally, I had to be so careful opening them that I seriously doubt some of the others will remain intact when I open them again to retreive the DVD's I placed inside. I had intended to order more to continue converting my DVD collection, but I certainly will need to reevaluate my options now."
4,Miss Zukas does it again,"I enjoy the Miss Zukas series very much. The contrast between Helma and Ruth makes for a good read. Overall, I have enjoyed all of the books in this series. The plots and writing are good, the only negative aspect of the books are the head of the Library, Moonie nut or whatever her name is. Her I cannot stand. If I was writing this series, I would make her the next murder victim with Helma Zukas solving the murder and becoming the next head of the library. I think that would be a good way for the series to go."
3,She's running out of plots already,Somewhat far-fetched; can people be as stupid as these characters
5,Simplifies the process of attaining higher abilities.,"I bought this book hoping to introduce simple and concise exercises to my youngster. What I was delighted to find, was a step by step manual describing basic flatwork right up to and including more difficult grid and course work. Excellent book which I highly recommend."
5,It works!,"The layout, illustrations and occasional words of wisdom found in this book can only help develop positive results for both horse and rider. What I especially liked is the variety of exercises and the gradual progression from basic fundamentals to the challenge levels. More importantly though, after three months of practicing some of the more basic and intermediary flatwork exercises with my four year old horse, the results are obvious even to the greenest of eyes. With no boredom setting in! Truly a well thought out book of exercises that ought be part of any training programme for horse and rider development."
4,Another great but fluffy translation from the LCL,"Loebs are excellent translations of the ancient passages and include the original on the previous page, so that you may have the latin (or Greek) on one page then the english on the next. This particular Loeb was translated back in 1914 and is somewhat ""fluffy""-it is literal in someplaces yet very artistically translated in others. But this is it's benefit. If you can translate Latin then you can compare your translation to theirs and vice-versa. This is an excellent method to practice one's translation skills.Another particulary useful help in the Loeb series is their inclusion of the Life and Works of the author. These include useful tidbits of where we find their works (ex. other authors) and the times in which they wrote. If one does not wish to have the Latin text then there are other translations which are cheaper and just as informative (ex. Penguins)and a little more literal than the earlier Loebs."
4,Kept me interested,I've been a reader of Buckland for ages and just recently started reading his fiction. This book was an interesting read that kept me going forward.
5,The Return of Good Music,"I love this album. Its complete with beautiful lyrics and vocals, slammin funky grooves, and a killer beat throughout that make you remember why you love music. I thoroughly respect donavon's work on this album, as it challenges his previous work and promises to bring ""good"" music back into style. I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Quality tracks,This CD is quite different from his usual style but gee its good. The smoothe funky sounds make this CD special. Highly recommended.
4,Frankenreiter didn't disappoint,"This is a bit of the 70's groovy music beat...but his soothing voice still comes through. I liked this one due to his voice and tone, but prefer his more folkish beats in other of his albums."
2,Move by yourself,"I liked it when I previewed the music on Amazon. I listened to it for a little while, then I just forgot about it.Wasn't something I thought about, afterwards."
1,Disappointed...,"I bought his first album a few years ago and liked it... He wasn't one that I told my friends to rush out and buy--but I listen to it occasionally. His new album sounds exactly like his old one--same songs, same beat, etc. While his music is mellow and relaxing, there's nothing substantial about his songs. I listen to the music, but don't remember the words. I'd rather spend my money on something else."
4,Fantastic Book!,I highly recommend this book. It has helped write the Different Flags screenplay. Eugenia RenskoffDifferent Flags
5,the next best thing to a personalized analysis,"Keane's approach to screenwriting emphasizes building on the foundations of concept and character, not just plugging variables into a screenplay formula. The chapters are organized in order of importance _for the success of the script,_ always posing tough questions upfront that can save the writer days of rewrite. Every time I start a new project or get stuck on one aspect, I go back to this book relying on it to point out story weaknesses as well as bring up practical business considerations. This guide is the next best thing to a personalized analysis, making the most of your abilities. Keane's anecdotes, advice, and tips carry weight because he writes from inside the entertainment industry, selling scripts that get produced today. From inkling of an idea to finding an agent, Keane's book is the most thorough and definitive screenwriting guide I've ever read."
5,The tools you need to get started!,"Chris Keane's book is absolutely powerful for the screenwriting novice, such as me. His instructional approach is easy to understand and encouraging. He explains how to begin -- how to keep motivated -- and how to pursue. His simple exercises show how to develop your story, character and structure -- then, he lets you know what to do next. Mr. Keane is a gifted writer and an excellent instructor. I highly recommend this publication for anyone wishing to achieve a screenwriting career."
5,Best Screenwriting book ever,"As a beginning screenwriter the advice in this book can not be ignored. This book will give you the confidence to write that first draft, the most important step. Addressing everything from structure and formatting to agents and Hollywood business, this book is a must have for anyone who dreams of seeing their work made into a feature film."
5,Fits and serves its purpose,"Not much to rate here, the ring easily threaded onto my Sigma lens and adapts the Cokin P filter holder to my lens as advertised."
4,A great bargain if you know what you're in for,"Fifteen years after his death, DG has decided to give us ultra-bargain box sets of Bernstein's late recordings. As is well known, he could be eccentric in this period, often too slow and self-indulgent. Those flaws are at their worst here in the Sibelius Sym. #2 form Vienna and the Elgar from London. But the other Sibelius, particularly Sym. #7, shows real depth of feeling and justifies Bernstein's expressive indulgences. The Four Sea Interludes are moving for being part of the last public concert he gave in Tanglewood with the BSO, and the orchestra plays wonderfully for him. The rest of the performances fall somewhere in between these extremes. They will all remain controversial, I imagine, but there's a great deal of enjoyment to be had here if you know what you are in for."
4,Good price for another view of Sibelius,"Bernstein recorded a cycle for Sony and it is out of print. You can get it as part of a 60 disc collection. I hear it is quite ordinary. I have part of it. I agree that the 5th there is well done.This is Bernstein's view of slow tempi. They fit quite well with symphony 1 and 2. The 5th and 7th disc is also interesting, but have not made up my mind on it. I have a favorite of the 5th and it has much less drama. But this one is OK too.The discs had to use filler for the first two discs, though Sibelius tone poems would have been better. But this is all they had.Live recordings, good sound, slow tempi. Interesting. But I think I prefer Segertam for that concept. Still, quite enjoyable.The Elgar and Britten pieces are fine as far as I can tell."
1,Eucalyptus drowned by other (mal)odors,"The bath soak had a hint of eucalyptus that was overwhelmed by rancid odors. I was not able to even use it. The ingredients list is not the same on every bottle. Is Aubrey's experimenting with the formula because of this problem? Also, I wonder if they do any stability testing of this product - perhaps Aubrey's preservative just isn't working."
2,Directions difficult to follow,"Very poor directions. Trial and error is the only way to put this thing together. At least the instructions weren't in Chinese, but there is confusion in what they are trying to get you to do. Further, extra odd pieces came with it which have no function."
3,Larger than I expected,"I needed an exact fit for inside of a cabinet. The dimensions listed were correct, but didn't include the nubs that stick up. It didn't fit."
4,Sturdy,Fit well on closet shelf to hold extra bottles of wine. Some flexiibility in spacing between rows. Went together easily.
4,Excellent solution for smaller count storage needs,Received this today and assembled in ~10 minutes. Very simple yet elegant design.Wanted a small solution for downstairs pantry wine storage. Dimensions were spot on. Fits pantry very well.
3,Not so stackable?,"I have several hundred bottles so had hoped to stack at least 3 of these units on top of each other at a time, so each column held 36 bottles. Unfortunately, it seems that only 2 can be stacked at a time, so i have many short, 24 bottle units dotted about my floor, which I have to crouch down to see. Not true when it says ""stack as many as you like,"" or, if it is true, I can't figure out how!Edited: Okay. I eventually discovered how to stack a few of these. They work just fine and look nice. I think the cost of shipping and handling is out of wack with their price, though."
5,Changing but still the same,Sunscreem's original hybrid of hard core techno beats with plenty of live guitars in the mix with a lot of soaring vocals courtesy Lucia Holm is forever inprinted in my mind - CHANGE OR DIE - although not as bold and fierce still manages to capture the Sunscreem energy - the epic force of Exodus makes it a true rave anthem - the lush layers of When and Looking At You intoxicate and the pop lyrics of White Skies and Secrets make Sunscreem a true band in every sense of the word with a resume of style few could ever try to duplicate. Keep on screeming!!
2,Too much introspection with no action for me,"This one was a very difficult read for me. Just too slow, too much introspection, way too much focus on religion (dinosaurs or not, religion still has a place in society). I was expecting a bit more of a sci-fi book here and it's really fantasy. Which is fine if that's your thing. I just really disliked this book - a shame too because I love the idea of dinosaurs as a sentient, evolved civilization!"
5,COLLECTIBLE 7 OF 9,"This item is in great condition. made a perfect birthday gift to my collector boyfriend. the packaging is in good shape, and the character looks so much like Jeri Ryan."
5,GREAT HISTORICAL FICTION,"Carrie's family is ambushed by indians. She is put under the care of an englishman named Beaver Dick. To Carrie's horror she finds out Dicks wife is an Indian. Carrie instantly hates her. However thru time Dicks wife {jenny} displays such kindness and gentleness Carrie starts to feel love toward her and her kids. This historical tale is well written and is constantly interesting for kids and adults alike.Word of caution for sensative youngsters, This does not have a happy ending."
5,Very Good,"This is an excellent book. I have now read it 6 times because I like it so much. The main character, Carrie Hill, is saved from an indian attack. She is told her whole family died. She goes to live with a man and his indian wife and children. She is angry about finding loving and caring people who are indians. She finally discovers how wonderful they are though and excepts them, and learns to love them with all her heart. This book is set in the beautiful Tetons. The plot, exposition, and everything in this book is absolutely wonderfully written. I quick but awesome read."
3,Expect a Miracle,"In the title it states ""you won't be disappointed"" maybe I need to re-read the book. I was a little disappointed."
2,Ligthweight buckle,"Don't buy this buckle if you are hoping for the old ww2 heavy-brass web-belt buckle. These are smaller and much lighter gauge metal than the original. The reviewer who gave it four stars must not have had any experience with the old-style buckles. I do have to admit, that these lighter buckles are everywhere and the heavier ones are becoming very scarce and hard to find. However, other manufacturers to make heavier buckles, just not in brass, unfortunately. Billings (MT) Army Navy Surplus store [...] claims to have the heavier brass buckle, so I may try there next."
4,The best Cirque CD,"This is by far my favourite CD of Le Cirque du Soleil. Rene Dupere's melodies are incredibly arranged on this CD, making it enjoyable from beginning to end. I recommend this CD of Le Cirque to all the others."
3,Three Stars,"Excellent CD but I got it for a skating program and there is a lot of singing on it. Otherwise, its pretty good."
3,Great Interpretations but Patchy Sound Quality!,"This is a great idea to package classical cds for the masses. The cardboard box which holds 5 paper sleeves to keep the cds is very well designed and the low price for 5 discs makes this great value for money. The only gripe I have with this is the patchy sound quality. We get great sound levels and production on some of the symphonies but noticeably on Symphony No. 9, the sound quality seems to suffer a little and this is also the case for parts of Symphony No. 6. Otherwise, this is a great way for collectors of Bernstein's works to start a collection."
3,Broad shoulders,"These Bernstein/WPO performances and DG recordings are good of course, how could they be bad. Even so, this symphonic cycle doens't make it into the top ten of Beethoven's symphonies and it should certainly not be anyone's first or only choice.Fans of Bernstein will probably give it five ***** stars before or even without a hearing and it is a very attractively priced for which I'm grateful.Personnaly, I prefer a conductor who tries to the best of his ability to play the composer's music and less the conductor's interpretation of the same.Still, Beethoven has broad shoulders and there is place on them for many a conductor with their own views. We are happily spoilt for choice."
2,Mis-labled lable,The Beethoven 9 Symphonies conducted by Leonard Bernstein is a good CD set. I have the vinyl version from the late 1960's. My biggest gripe is that the CD's are mislabled as to contents. I had to relable them myself. I don't like that. I will think twice before I purchase a product from this vendor again.
5,5 CD set of Beethoven symphonies,"I ordered this five-CD set and received it in a timely fashion. There was a caveat in the packing notes indicating any problems w/ the product would have to be noted w/in 7 days. So I listened to all the symphonies [which were great, of course] but four of the five CD's ""skipped."" I was not happy with the product condition so I followed directions to return. I was not getting a reply via the route described in the paperwork so I emailed the company, informed them of the problem not only with the CDs but with attempting to obtain an RA number and they quickly mailed a postage-paid return envelope to me. I returned the product on 3-20-10 and checked with the company on 4-5-10 to learn they have still not received the returned CD set! I am still out the money I paid and I will not buy CDs/any product from this company again."
2,why bother?,"I have been listening to the Beethoven symphonies for 50 years. More than any other symphonic output, or for that matter, any other genre of classical music, they are central to the core of classical music. Perhaps if I had listened to this set earlier in life, I might feel differently about it. But to it so recently, I just can't summon any enthusiasm for it. I find it bloated and pretentious. Both Bernstein and the Vienna deserve better than this and, together, they owe us better.No one summoned more majesty for Beethoven than Bruno Walter with his pick up band. And then there is George Szell's classic cycle, perhaps the best ever to capture the heart and soul of the music. For modernists, ther is Sir Charles Mackerras in live recordings with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra/ Philharmonia Orchestra. Norrington and the London Classical Players is very good. Finally thre is a young, vital Bernstein with the NY Philharmonic.Please check some these out."
3,There is some persistent,"These are Beethoven's 9 Symphonies conducted by Bernstein with Vpo (1977-79 years). There is some persistent. The persistence might be clearly understood, if you compare these with his works ofBeethoven: Symphonies Nos. 1-9; Overtures; Violin Concerto (Limited Edition)with NYP (1961-64 years). I think that the persistence is caused by Bernstein's decline, though the decline is helped in Vienna Phil's good performance and the good performance of the excellent song hand in ninth symphony. This complete volume might depend on the listener's preference."
2,"Boring, uninspiring...","I had great hopes for this book and it is indeed, easy to read, as another reviewer stated. But the ideas are quite uninspiring, and while the concept of feng shui are described, I was not inspired by them. I don't quite see the logic of how buring incense would help me deal with my clutter.This is a good book to get ideas on feng shui but to really deal with the clutter in your homes, offices and lives, you should look elsewhere."
1,Spoon River Travesty,"Spoon River AnthologyClarification: Amazon will not allow anything lower than one star; however, this mess deserves NO STARS.In the 1980's, an educational film company produced a 20-minute documentary about Spoon River Anthology, including excellent readings from the work and views of the actual gravestones in the Petersburg, Illinois, cemetery and of the town itself. In addition, short interview comments by Petersburg residents demonstrated the strong, lingering hard feelings natives harbor about revelations in Edgar Lee Masters' masterpiece.Unfortunately, this DVD, which is neither thoroughly nor accurately described by Amazon, is a hollow representation of something, but it does not do right by Spoon River Anthology. It is nothing more than a few dull recitations performed on a dull set by uninspired actors doing an easy gig for a few bucks. Viewers will gain no insight from this ripoff. Skip it! Better yet, Amazon: Drop it from your catalog!"
5,A philosophical and clarion warning,"The Globalization Of Nothing is an articulate economic thesis by Professor George Ritzer (University of Maryland) that articulately postulates the short and long-term effects of globalization. Claiming that societies worldwide are moving away from ""something"" (defined as unique and distinctive indigenous social forms), toward the ""nothing"" (globalized products that are centrally controlled and blandly the same worldwide), The Globalization Of Nothing warns that societies all over the world today are rapidly losing unique customs, local businesses, gathering places, even the hallmark of personal interaction. The Globalization Of Nothing is a philosophical and clarion warning regarding the creeping and homogenizing impersonality of severe economic forces."
2,Pfizer Pet-Tabs VS. Virbac Pet-Tabs,"I find it very odd that there are two different manufacturers of ""Pet-Tabs"" and their labeling is practically identical: Pfizer and Virbac. I'm not sure how that is legal. If I buy ""Pet-Tabs"" from my vet, they're always Pfizer, but when I ordered these I realized they were quite different and didn't know why until I realized they were made by Virbac. The Pfizer tablets seem to be of higher quality--moister, denser consistency, darker color. Overall, fresher. The Virbac ones are paler, dryer and more powdery when broken apart. Buyer beware..."
3,aight,it okay nothing like that other stuff i recover off of here. solid golld seameal for horse is the truth.
3,Break easily.,It looks cute and is a classic appearing Brown Betty teapot. I had 2 of these. The first one I didn't warm well enough apparently (I did put hot water in it) and it cracked. Be sure to warm the pot very well first or else allow your boiling water to cool more before putting it in the pot.
5,As advertised,This capacitor was just what the doctor ordered.It performed as advertised.I would recommend this to a friend.Thanks for the fast service.
4,Almost 2 Games in One,"This game was created in a unique way. You can choose each of 2 versions of Arthur from a storybook. As the version of Arthur is chosen, the game unfolds independently of the other, but within the same world. Subtle scenes & dialogues will change, depending on which path is chosen. The graphics are older, but still lovely & imaginative. Recommend following this game up with the Arthur's Knights II Secrets of Merlin."
5,It just keeps getting better...,"This is my all-time favorite manga series, and with each new volume, the stories just keep getting better and better. This volume increases character development, especially in Carrot.Anyway, onto the actual stories. The first one is about Carrot coping with the fact that he is the God of Destruction. Marron is worried about him as well. This story is short compared to most chapters of SH.The second story, magic carpender, is all one big shot (Instead of it being split up into several chapters, like most extended stories, it is a 150 page chapter). The Sorcerer Hunters go back to work disposing of Evil Sorcerers, but this time it isn't just a Sorcerer they need to face. This has to be one of my favorite stories, and I could read it over and over. It made me cry... *snif*If you never read the series, I highly suggest you start at the first book and go from there. You won't regret it, SH is an awesome story."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Rec'd this as a Christmas gift in 2009 and less than 2 years later it no longer works. Went to make my boys pancakes one morning and the thing wouldn't heat up. At all. This has been used less than 15 times and cost around $50. What a waste! Also, I agree with what others say in that the non-stick surface is a joke. I used butter all the time so my pancakes wouldn't stick."
1,"doesn't heat, terrible product, manufacturer should be ashamed","Griddle doesn't heat properly. It starts to heat up, and then stops. I've removed the plate and tried a number of different ways to get the product to work. The manufacturer should recall this item. It's shameful that someone can sell something like this...it was a gift, and we will never buy low-end Rival products. Throwing it away, and it is brand new out of the box."
2,"Good idea, poor execution","I was very disappointed with this griddle - ended up returning it. Putting pancake batter on the cooking surface cooled it by almost 100 degrees (according to my IR thermometer), and it was very slow to reheat -- resulting in badly cooked pancakes. It appears to me that the removable/washable cooking surface means the temperature sensor isn't close enough to the cooking surface, so it reacts very slowly to changes in surface temperature -- it takes a few minutes before it even notices that the temperature has dropped and turns on the heat.I was also disappointed with the size. Too narrow to cook medium sized pancakes side-by-side, and too long to conveniently fit on my counter. Shorter and wider would have been a better choice for me, so that's what I'm looking for now, although I would have kept this one if it had done a good job of cooking pancakes.On the good side, it did an excellent job on a grilled cheese sandwich."
1,Doesn't Heat Up,"I bought this griddle and was excited to give it a try. I was cooking sausage at church at our men's monthly breakfast alongside one of the old griddles. On the highest setting, this thing took twice as long to cook and never really got anything crispy. I tried it at home on bacon - same thing. I took it back and exchanged it for an identical model - same results. The readout says 425 degrees, but it is nowhere close. Buy this only if you like to warm things up!"
1,"Lousy product, do not buy!","Similar to other's experiences, my griddle's non-stick surface burned through the first time I heated it to 375 to cook pancakes. In just 3 uses, using only silicone type utensils on it, pancakes stick so bad they are ruined. Rival is absolutely useless with customer support. IF you read the reviews and still choose to try your luck, save your receipt, you will need it to get Rival to accept your product back."
5,We all have our own experiences,"I was surprised to read the negative reviews of this product. I've come to respect Rival's brand, and when I saw this item I couldn't wait to try it. It's simple to use, unbelievably easy to clean, the digital display is a bonus. My only wish is that the grill plate was exchangable with a ribbed one. I've had not problems with anything sticking and the finish is smooth and intact. I'm actually a little hard on appliances, and this one (as all Rival's products I own: a skillet, waffle iron, slow cooker) remains in excellent condition and performance. Sorry others had a bad experience."
3,"Keys, please","The MP3's are fine, as MP3's and accompaniment tracks, however, while you are offered a ""high"" ""middle"" and ""low"" track, nowhere can I find that it actually says _what_ key these tracks are in, which would be useful when attempting to sync them up with sheet music."
2,POOR SOUND RUINS THIS RECORDING,"There are probably no better ""Turandot"" and ""Calif"" on record than Birgit Nilsson and Jussi Bjorling. But strangely enough, RCA has remastered the sound of this historic recording (made even more interesting with Renata Tebaldi singing ""Liu"")so that it is flat, dull and unexciting. Not my favorite opera, it is, at least, always hair-raising. But not this set of CD's. In fact, the vinyl recording had better sound. I don't think I would ever rate sound quality more important than singers' performances, except in this opera where opulant sound is everything. If you are looking for a complete ""Turandot,"" look elsewhere."
3,"Nice shoe, but sole too flexible, causes pain in ball of foot","The shoe is nice, soft, supple leather, sole appears to be a good traction one, but not for dress wear; It also looks like it will wear down fairly quickly compared to harder soles. It seems comfortable at first, but the sole is too flexible if you have a foot problem, as I do. It causes excessive pressure on the ball of the foot and that leads to pain and to swelling, even when wearing orthotics inside it. If your feet are fine and you have no orthotic issues, and you want a good casual shoe that will be used outside or on slippery surfaces, this will probably do you well. I don't wear miine--ony used them several times."
2,Melodrama,"As Deirdre Bair's scholarly 2003 biography of Jung foolishly underestimates and dismisses Sabina Spielrein and her ""countertransference"" affair with the married Dr. Jung, the plays the once psychotic Dr. Spielrein is inspiring since the discovery of her diary and letters equally foolishly melo-dramatize both her and the relationship to the Wagnerian max. The truth of Dr. Spielrein's influence on the history of psychoanalysis and analytical psychology is yet to be told; Sabina is for melodramatically irrelevant entertainment purposes only."
5,Works great for teen,My daughter went on a school trip with her insulin and it traveled great. Twelve hours on a bus! We will get a lot of use from the Medi-Fridge Micro Cooler.
1,Dissatisfied,"If this case is just like the red one I bought (and it looks identical except for the color) I would not buy it. I bought mine because the one I had only had room for two vials, and I needed room for 3. When it came it looked cheap. The bottles don't sit tightly into the foam so if you stand the case on end, the bottles fall and hit each other. The freezer packs don't stay frozen very long. The pockets for syringes, etc. are too small. The velcro tore on one pocket less than 3 weeks after I started using it. Even the zipper is hard to close around the corners of the case, and you have to continually be pulling one side of the zipper down over the corner to zip it.I will invest in a better case and spend the money."
3,Disappointing.,"Both my friend and I purchased this book. We agreed that the foods in the cook book remind us of home and make us homesick reading her introductions to the recipes...however, making the actual recipe was disappointing. Alot of the measurements and ingrediants were wrong in some of the recipes. I was truely disappointed. For me it did not come together."
3,So-so,The case does it's job - protecting your Treo. It gets dirty easily though and is bulkier than desired. I notice a difference in the weight of the Treo with the case on or off and I sometimes find it hard to use the covered buttons. Ideally they would make a thinner case and I would suggest getting the black one.
3,different alternative,"the cover is very cool. and sleek looking it protects very well .But one thing they dont tell you, is that the screen that comes with the cover gets scratched very easly with day to day use . but over all i think its a good product after all."
3,Treo 650 SkinTight rubber holster,"The cover did a good job of protecting the phone and really helped the grip of the phone. The rubber is soft and provides a good grip to hold onto, making it nearly impossible to drop the phone! However, the holster is plastic and broke within 2 weeks of use. I still used the cover to protect the phone. The rubber also prevented the phone from falling out of my pocket."
5,Excellent!,"This watercolor instructional is by Taylor Bush. I don't know why her name is not on it. Also, I've reviewed her dvds before but my reviews are no longer here. Very strange.I've never met Ms. Bush, but her dvds are wonderful and I want her to get credit for them.She also offers a video called Happy Palette. I own both of these. If you love watercolor, you will love her dvd's. The focus is on the painting, always. You see very little of Ms. Bush, but are invited to watch, close-up, as she paints and does a wonderful non-intrusive narration. It's a very good way to really see what an artist does. She explains it all as she goes.There is a bonus dvd with it - All the Pretty Colors - that really tells you about colors, pigments, mixing, etc.I recommend all three of the DVDs by Taylor Bush -HAPPY PALETTECLAY POTSFLORAL BOUQUET"
5,Great Book,"I loved this book. Well-written, comfortable read for a great evening. One you can share with your daughter, mother, and friends with no apologies. Buy and enjoy!"
4,Fantastic fantasy,"Called unwillingly out of retirement, Matthias joins with Hyrn to vanquish the demons ravaging their world. A would-be suicide mission, made doable with soulsteel weapons forged by Matthias, turns into a journey through time and unimaginable worlds. Along the way we are confronted with the relationship with our demons. Is it possible that we can become attached to some, maybe love them? Maybe they can become us or we can become them or both.The author challenges our sterotypes with a thought provoking and imaginitive story where power, love and honor are not always where you expect them. How does this all end? I was surpised and entertained. Good stuff!"
1,Bad purchase,"This book has no content. You can barely read a bit about the websites featured there, and most of them are outdated. Although the book is published in 2001, websites there seem to be old.I didn't agree with the choices of the websites this book features either. It seems like it has been put together by someone who really doesn't spend that much time on the Internet."
5,Fantastic new author...,"(from the back cover)In a single moment, Grace Duet's life changed forever. After a near fatal car crash left a gaping hole in her memory, Grace wakes up in a strange town, with a husband she can't remember and a killer hot on her trail.Positive that she has forgotten a deadly secret, Grace sets out to find the missing pieces of her puzzle, but her efforts are hampered by the people around her. It seems everyone in town is hiding a secret or harboring a grudge--including Grace's new groom. And for Grace, the closer she comes to understanding what transpired in her missing days, the more danger she finds herself in.Written in the finest tradition of contemporary mystery novelists, Lori Davis weaves a story of deceit and danger that will keep you guessing until the very last page."
4,I LIKED IT,"I READ THIS BOOK LAST WEEKEND. IT WAS LONG ENOUGH TO BE INVOLVING, BUT SHORT ENOUGH THAT I WASN'T GIVING UP OTHER THINGS IN MY LIFE TO READ THIS BOOK. I LIKED IT, THOUGH. SOME PARTS SEEMED SLOW, BUT THE WRITING WAS INTERESTING AND FUNNY AND IT WAS FUN TO READ."
2,Buy something else,"This is a radio interview with Nick Pope, minus the interviewer's questions, set to a series of about a dozen still photos of airborne anomalies that keep cycling through. Certainly not much to look at. The interview content was okay, and the only reason I rated it so highly. You are better off logging onto You Tube - they've got better videos for free. Full marks to Mayan Animations, though, for publishing credible UFO material."
3,Works for WindowsP or lower version OS NOT Windows 7,"I've used this software for years to build and maintain my website, but the software will NOT work on Windows 7. UGH! Have a floating website..."
2,Should be called peanut butter snack book!,"I was hoping to find some help in the snack dept, as I have a limited variety of ideas for my partially food-allergic kid. He is allergic to a few items -- one happens to be peanuts, the other egg whites, but that's it. And unfortunately, 80% of the recipes in this book include peanut butter, nuts, or eggs! Nothing more original. I expected some of this knowing kids love PB, but most of the recipes are inclusive of one of the 2 allergens my son has, so this book was a huge disappointment.If you're child is allergy-free, this book is for you. Nevertheless, it's still peanut-butter heavy. Given the incidence of kids with allergies in today's world, it would be great if more cookbook authors gave a section/chapter of their work to allergy-free recipes for kids."
2,Too much fat!,"This book contains way too many recipes with high fat items. It also doesn't contain the nutritional info for the finished items, which makes it useless to me. If you're thinking ""healthy"" means moderate to low fat/calorie, then this isn't the book for you!"
2,Yumm... trans-fats!!,"Wonder when trans-fats became healthy - there's so much margerine called for in this book you'd have to buy half a case! Sure, you can substitute butter, but fat is fat is fat. On a possitive note, the recipes come out well using reduced fat peanut butter - also used butter in half the amount with some success. Not thrilled with this book."
2,it is a fair book,"It is just like all the other kid recioes out there. I have not used it once. I find better recipes in Parents magazine, and Family Fun magazine."
2,typos galore,"I bought this book to do exactly what the title says, to be ""introduced to Fortran 95"". The book starts by describing what a computer is, and on the next page discusses ""implicit initialization of derived type objects"". Where is the intermediate material??? In addition, the authors of this book might know the Fortran language, but they certainly don't know the English language. There's at least one typo on each page. Also, as stated in another review, the sample problems have errors. I found it difficult to learn from this book, and i'm going to throw it out and buy another one to use. I couldn't find the answer to any of my questions in this book, instead, I've had to play around with the example programs to find the authors' errors. Carelessly written book."
5,What a wonderful CD!!,"When I ran across this CD, I took a chance and ordered it. I am well-pleased with the results! Poulenc's music is wonderfully witty, and it's a real toss-up when it comes to choosing between the English and French versions. Both of the narrators are charming and bring lots of personality to the charming classic story. The other Poulenc pieces are very well-done; at these prices, blow youself to the complete Naxos set of his chamber music."
1,Old product,Product received as ordered. Adhesive film on bottom of units could not be removed to attach to bumper. Called manufacturere and was told they never had this problem and that I must have bought old product on line. Suggested I replace adhesive strips on bottom as it was not there problem.
1,Not working???????,"I went by a herd of antelope & they weren't fazed by the deer whistles. The brochure said elk, moose, deer, reindeer, caribou. I assumed the antelope would be a part of that group but maybe not. I haven't seen any deer so I'm not sure it works???"
5,Deer alerts,These work great. When I drove my a herd of deer in a field they all perked their ears up and looked at my car so I knew it worked.I'm glad these were invented.
5,deer alert sav a life,Reasonably priced and easy to attach and non obtrusive in place. Bought these after great word of mouth and I guess the best thing to say is hopefully they do the job and not have to say you ever had an accident because it did the job.As a previous reviewer said his whole family had them except his sister and she was the only 1 to have had an accident with a deer. I'm hoping it works on other animals as well as to avoid them. Purchased 6 total over 3 shopping times all from Ace Hardware. Came in a timely manner and packaged securely.
2,Disappointed for the first time.,"I recieved the CD on time, but when I opened the package I found the CD jewel case was broken and I replaced it with a new one then when I played the CD I found that tracks 7,8,and 9 would not play out of a total of 12 tracks.L.W.Thiel"
4,my kids love it; I'm lukewarm,"My kids love this book, and several phrases (""a pox on those scurvy harpoons!"" and ""nantucket sleigh ride"") have become standard family lingo in a short period of time. The story is a fun tall tale, and the pictures charming. Other than the aforementioned phrases, the writing could be crisper and more elegant, but it's held up reasonably well to re-reading every night for a couple weeks now, so that's better than most."
3,More of a character study than an expose of molecular biology,"I don't think this book is meant to be a lay review of molecular biology. It is really an examination of the lives of several key figures in molecular biology. Getting to know these players helps the lay reader get a feel for the humanity behind the scientific headlines, and was for me, at least, comforting in that regard.There were numerous typographical errors in this book! Where were the editors?"
3,The Genetecist Who Played Hoops with my DNA,"Difficult material on genetics made more readable by focusing on the personal traits of great researchers. It helps if you have some professional background in the bio-sciences. This new, complex world of DNA and genetics will only continue to surprise us in the improved techniques and the great possibilities of treatment for genetic fault diseases. I found the book very interesting."
5,Classic in the making!!,"Truly a masterpiece! Kuku's music is sooo soulful. The melodies are elegant and the lyrics are thoughtful! Kuku's approach, which strips music down to its basics, is refreshing. The tracks are built around acoustic guitar, bass, and bongos, with occasional sprinkling of a flute, organ, or piano. Definitely not overproduced. JUST Right! The CD starts with ""Love,"" that sounds like a fresh ocean breeze at sunrise. It continues with sensual ""Sunrise in Bed,"" and energetic ""Overwishing."" Then come encouraging and uplifting ""It's alright to sing so blue"" and playful and catchy ""Call it Whatever."" The arabic-influenced ""Lifer or One Nighter"" makes you want to flow into the night.This is a great CD! Kuku's accented vocals are strong and melodious. His 5-octave range is amazing. Would have never thought that he did the backgrounds on ""sunrise in Bed"" himself.Great CD. Pick it up today!! Can't wait until the full album, ""Unexpected Pleasures."""
1,"Frege, Wittgenstein and... boredom",Most boring of the handbook college students that I have read. I recommend to read the authors studied in this book in their original works.
3,un comentario en español,"Tengo el 4 volumen de esta colección y he de deciros que dicho volumen consiste en 3 libros antiguos de wrestling fotocopiados. La forma es deficiente pero el contenido es muy interesante.Me parece una compilación bastante cara, puesto que no recoge nada original y las fotocopias no son para nada de buena calidad."
4,Excellence,"Yes, this is an excellent book. I will recommend reading it together with Lermontov`s ""Hero of our Times"" (ru: ""geroj nashego vremeni""). Enjoy !"
2,Puerile,"I forced myself to read every last word of this book because it is a classic. Borrring! I appreciate that it was indeed something for it's day, but except as historical literature reference it does not stand the test of time, which is in this case 200 years."
1,HOW CAN ANYONE READ THIS GUY????,"I am a book lover; read ALL the time, and thoroughly enjoy the classics; that is, until I came upon Stendhal!!! I tried and tried to read ""Red & the Black"", even ""The Charterhouse of Parma'...and just could NOT get into these books!!! I do not know what it is; his writing style, I want to say.....it just seems so cold to me.....no flow to the narrative, etc.....Would sure like to know what others think who really enjoy reading this guy!!!Please share what you like about his works!!! I'd be interested in finding out!!!Thanks!!"
2,Difficult to get captivated by his writing style...did not like it....,"If you like the endless verbosity and meaningless realism of Balzac, you'll like Stendahl. I found him BORING....Before you jump to conclusions, I've thoroughly enjoyed works by Victor Hugo, Dostoevsky, Voltaire and other French and Russian authors of Classics. I just wasn't captivated by it and found his writing style average for a supposed CLASSIC."
5,"By gosh, it WORKS!","I got a new PC with a built-in gigabit NIC card, so I bought an Airlink gigabit PCI card for my old PC plus this Airlink 5-port Gigabit Ethernet switch, That way, I could network the two machines at gigabit speeds -- especially useful for over-the-net backups and transfer of 30GB of data from old PC to new PC.I plugged them in, installed the NIC driver in the old machine, and by gosh, it WORKED! Transfer rates were faster than with my old 100Mb/s network.I uplinked this switch to my broadband modem (through a hardware firewall) for Internet access, and it flawlessly auto-detected the lower-speed Ethernet connection and that worked, too.Based on my experience so far, this switch is a solid product and a real bargain for the price (I paid just under $35 in 2005; I just bought a second one for $20 in May 2008)."
5,Solid Switch,"This thing is solid,, heavy, simple, plug and play, and .... thats about it. No issues, no hassle, no failure."
4,Guitar music for beginners,"This book is great for guitar chord beginners. I teach many young children and this book has helped them not only memorize simple chord fingerings, but it has helped increase the speed of their chord changes. The book is full of nursery rhyme type songs that everyone has heard. This makes playing the songs fun and easy for children. I would suggest this book to beginners or any guitar player that has children. The songs are fun and entertaining."
3,Awesome at first... Not so much later,"I purchased this cover in July for my 1974 Chevy Nova which I have not begun restoration on. I was very excited when I recieved it. It fit well, seemed to be crafted well, and secured easily with a small bungee cord thru the reinforced center holes. I thought it would buy me enough time to finish my current project. In September I noticed a very small hole near the driver side headlight, and thought to myself 'Oh well, its still holding up well for the price'. I sewed on a small patch and went on my merry way. By late November the cover was falling apart like a wet paper towel. I am still a month away from finishing my current project and starting the Nova and still haven't taken the cover off once. Initial quality seemed fairly high for the price but now I am left wanting, out $60 and a cover."
5,A beautiful and practical book for enhancing your home!,"I purchased this book several months ago and have been thrilled with it's beautiful photography, clear instruction and easy (yet clever) ideas for gardening indoors. My home is not set up for big outdoor gardens, so these small container and tabletop gardens have been a godsend! I had never thought of decorating my kitchen and bathrooms with live plantings, and wow, what an improvement! I am buying copies for my friends and family. This makes a wonderful housewarming gift. Don't miss it!"
3,Very basic information,"I was hoping for a discourse on plants that work well together when potted together, grouping objects and living plants in interesting arrangements, keeping the living matter alive. Unfortunately, this book was limited to single species of plants living in its own container occasionally decorated with marbles.It did, however, have some good information about the length one could expect a cut plant to live, flowering durations, and the like.If you have a very difficult time keeping plants alive, then this book would probably be a good resource. The instructions are easy to follow, nice photos, etc. If you have any experience at all in gardening, I recommend trying to find something a little more advanced."
5,A beautiful book,"This book is beautifully done. The images are inspiring and it is an easy read. The esentials of cultivation, care and aesthetics are clearly explained. It is not a textbook by any means, but it is a wonderful resource for anyone wishing to bring the joys of gardening indoors."
3,Depth of a magazine,"The book uses a light treatment, like a magazine to me. Good layout and design of the book, more attention given to that than content. If I had paid full price and shipping I would not have been happy. No garden photos I will duplicate, just ok."
