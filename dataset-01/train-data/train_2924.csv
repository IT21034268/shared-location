3,Ok for the money,I have a Shih Tzu that needs help getting up on the bed. These steps are tall enough and he does use them but they needed to be weighted down as they will skid on rug or wood. Not quite as sturdy as I would have liked but do the job.
3,"Not a bell ringer, but okay.","I got this for my older cocker spaniel who couldn't make the jump to our bed about 30% of the time. She uses the stairs, but they move easily. Often, as she takes her last step to the bed, the stairs scoot away from the bed such that she can't use them to get down. We also have a toy Manchester and she uses them to get on but to get down, the steps are too narrow or too fast a rise and she has to leap off. For the price, it isn't a bad product, but that isn't exactly an endorsement. Plus, the peg on one side broke (hard plastic). I just used an old cork from a wine bottle shaved down a little and it is holding."
2,"I liked the looks of it, but the dogs did not like it.","I purchased this product so my weiner dogs could get on the bed easier. However, even with coaxing with treats, neither dog wanted anything to do with these steps. The colored pads that come with it have a slippery feel to them and I think that may have been part of the problem. But in all honesty I don't know if the product was the problem or just my dogs."
2,Bought for my mini dachshund,"Solvit PupSTEP + Plus Pet StairsI had purchased this item for my mini dachshund hoping to help her on and off the bed and couch. Unfortunately it just wasn't as stable as it should have been and the width on the steps was just a bit too narrow, even for her small body. I just was not comfortable with these steps and my little dog would not have anything to do with them. So unfortunately had to return them and will try to find some sturdier steps."
1,Hated it.,"We bought these stairs for our 11 year old Australian Cattle dog because we got a higher bed and he was whining to jump up. I thought these stairs were horrible. The product features states that it supports up to 120 pounds. Our dog is 60 pounds, and he was hesitant climbing on them because they were prone to falling over due to flimsiness. I thought they were cheaply made. The steps are narrow as well. Like the picture shows, I think this product is better for smaller dogs. We promptly returned the stairs to Amazon. I would not recommend them."
3,Doggie no likey.,"The quality and appearance of these steps are quite nice and tall enough to reach the couch or bed, but our Pom will not- absolutely not- use them. Granted, our Pom is larger than most at 11 pounds, so the steps just seem too narrow and steep for her. The steps say up to 25 pounds, though. I'm trying treats and training, but she no likey- not even for a treat. An indoor ramp might be better but they are too pricey. Next idea...?"
2,Steps too narrow for dogs... OK for cats,"After I ordered these steps for my dogs, my friend said she had purchased them also, but her dogs wouldn't use them. So, I borrowed hers and my dogs wouldn't use them either. The steps were too narrow for my dogs... even my Pomeranian wouldn't use it. At that point I wish I had not ordered them because I knew they would not work and I would need to send them back. However my cat liked it, but I didn't need it for her. So from my experience, I would only recommend these steps for cats.When my steps arrived, I returned them right away because after trying my friend's steps, I knew they would not work for my dogs."
4,"Takes some training, but works well.","The PupSTEP is nice, but sometimes they slip on the smooth plastic areas and the reason why I gave it 4 stars. It does a nice job, but it takes some training with the dogs."
1,maybe for a hampster on a flat surface,"Got one of these for my large, old, arthritic dog. The cats wouldn't even use it inside on a carpeted surface. It worked a few times outside next to the back of the SUV on a flat surface, but when I used it a few times on a slightly skewed surface away from home, the thing completely fell apart, with the dog on it. Luckily she wasn't hurt, but I can't say the same for my shoulder after having to hoist her rump into the car (which was also embarrassing). I really wish someone would make something lightweight yet durable, that did not require connections to the car, and that was wider. It slips on any outside surface, forcing one to hold it against the car in position, and the steps are way too shallow for most any critter."
5,Solvit PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs,Works great for the car for my 50 pound dog. Folds up to take with us. He is older and needed this set of steps to continue rides in the car.
5,right for the price,Not the prettiest but work great for my papillion to get on furniture. I would recommend this product for owners of small dogs.
4,light weight steps perfect for my senior cats,"My two beloved kitties are about 14 years old and having trouble making the jump up to my high rise Tempurpedic bed. I see a bit of clawing of the quilt on the way up. Solution, offer them stairs to the bed. They looked at it, smelled it, but didn't climb it. We had to do a few training trials and voila now they quietly climb the stairs to the bed. Very cute."
1,waste of money,collapsed every time the dog stood on it and she only weighs 7 lbs we donated it to a chuch garage sale
1,Does not work on ceramic tile floors,"We are already at a disadvantage when it comes to shipping, since we do not live in the contiguous/continental US. Many vendors do not wish to ship direct. We had to make arrangement to ship to my girlfriend in California and then reship to our home.Unfortunately my dogs will have nothing to do with this product. The stairs are not very stable on ceramic tile floors. Even placing a small area rug under the stairs does not fix the problem as far as the dogs are concerned. The steps now sit in the garage awaiting disposal.They may work on carpet."
1,Was disappointed in the PupSTEP,"I purchased this product for my Italian Greyhound with the expectation it would be great to take the stress off her long legs. I have found that the steps are so close together that she has to hunch her body together to use them. They are not as sturdy as I expected them to be. She only weights 12 lbs but they seem almost fragile. I did not think they look very good in my home as the entire thing is plastic. I will give this purchase to my son for his older, smaller dog and hope they can use it."
2,Dog Steps,"I was hoping my dog would feel comfortable using these steps to get into my tall bed (she has bad knees). However, the steps just weren't high enough to reach the top of the bed. She refused to use the steps. The steps are sturdy, lightweight and well made. My 2 1/2 year old grandson used them to climb on my bed and then jump off! Then, he carried them into my closet and bathroom to find out first hand what was ""up there!"" I was going to return them, but now I'm thinking I will keep them around for him!"
2,"""PupSTEP""","I purchased ""two"" Solvit PupSTEPs. Both arrived very quickly. However, both boxes were damaged. Though seemingly intact. One was assembled immediatly put to use. Our 108 year old (dog years)dog loves it.The second was assembled two weeks later for our vacation home. This unit was found to be missing the packet of padding for the steps and non-skid feet for the unit. Because we were anxious to put it to use, we cut and fitted ""peel-and-stick"" floor carpet squares to the unit. It works, but the factory pads fit and look much better.I like the units and only wish that a ""five"" step unit (higher!!) was available."
2,Product is okay,"The stairs are a little shaky which causes my dog to avoid them and try to jump up and down instead. Not a great product but the delivery, etc. was good."
3,Solvit Pet Stairs,"These are nice stairs, lightweight and sturdy. The height is a bit low for the newer, deep mattresses; however, it is a good height for sofas, chairs, etc. Dogs don't take to this naturally, there is a training curve but it's fairly short. Overall, if you have a smaller dog, this should work quite well for you."
5,Solvit PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs,"Ordered 2 and they both arrived next day. I couldn't believe it! Easy to assemble and they're working out just great for my cat who's recuperating from multiple double back leg surgeries. At first, didn't think he was going to use them, but he just needed to get the hang of it. Without them, he wouldn't be able to get on my bed or look out the window. Don't know if I will ever be able to put them away, but knowing they will collapse basically flat, is a real plus. Had done some online comparisons, and ordering from Amazon was a good deal."
3,Plus Pet Stairs are helpful,"Steps were basically just as pictured, came quickly, however, the actual steps themselves seem to be quite short for our dog (Westie). She will still use them but seems to have to focus to actually make each step quickly. Works well as she was unable to get up on the bed any longer as she ages and these make all the difference"
3,4 step stairs,"Higher than regular dog stairs, which is very good, and this one is handy because it folds for storage under the bed. Only drawback is that the treads are not as deep as other dog steps so my tiny maltese and yorkie(both under 5 lbs)had a hard time getting used to it - not enough room for front and back feet - it's still awkward for them, but they're doing it. If you don't need the fold-down feature, I'd recommend getting other stairs with deeper treads."
4,Mostly a good deal,"The steps were purchased so my 3 and a half lb. yorkie, Teddy, wouldn't jump off of our kingsize bed. It works for that purpose and he has mastered climbing the stairs as well although he does it with some hesitation. The only complaint I have is that the pieces of 'carpet' on two of the steps have come loose from the plastic. I will have to get some kind of epoxy and re-glue them to the steps, so that is a little inconvenient, but overall I am satisfied with how these steps work. We have a small space in our bedroom and they are just the right size to use off the corner of the bed."
5,doggie steps really work,"It is easy to set up and fold away under the bed. It took a few treats, one on each step, to get her to walk up and onto the bed. She can still jump but wanted to train her to use the steps, too. Works great for my small dogs. Had a great price as time's are tighter."
5,Great steps for our cat!,"Our 11 year old Siamese was having trouble getting up on our bed and so we ordered these steps for her to use. At first she ignored them (except to scratch them!), but within a couple of days she was RUNNING up and down them! They worked perfectly for our purposes."
3,"Works Great, but watch out for the shipping and handling charges!","The steps work fine, but I would not have bought them had I know that the separate shipping charges would be almost half the cost of the product, making them quite expensive for what they are. Advantages include being able to tuck them under the bed, compact enough that they don't take up too much floor space, and easy for my too small cat to learn how to use. After only two or three lessons she was happily coming up on the bed to sleep with us. Disadvantage is the final cost. If you can handle the final price tag of about $50, then purchase it."
4,pupSEP plus is a plus,I recently purchased the Solvit PupSTEP plus pet stairs for my toy dachshund so he could get up and down off of my new bed. It is considerable higher then my last bed and I was concerned as he has had back surgery in the past for a blown disc due to degenerative disc disease.It took him a few times using it for him to get the hang of it. Now he is a pro and I do not have to worry about him re-injuring his back!! Great product. Sturdy. My 1 and 2 year old grandchildren think I purchased it for them!
4,great product.,"The only issue I have with this product is really minor. Whenever our dog gets really excited and tries to climb therstairs too quickly, they get a little unstable. They've never fallen over or anything, it just scares our dog when she's on them. When she climbs them in a straight forward, calm approach then they work like a charm. It took about a month or so for her to get used to them and to use then regularly. I recommend this product to everyone who has a small dog."
4,Treads,Liked the stairs from Amazon but treads were too slippery. Glued astro turf on treads for better traction. Our Yorkie is a happy sleeper.
3,"Good and nice that it folds, but defintely shakes",I have a pug that is about 24 lbs. and she is pretty intimidated to go up it because it shakes while she climbs up. I think this is a problem that happens with dogs that weight more than 15 lbs.
5,Perfect,The stairs are just what I was hoping for and my dog is using it every day to get up on my bed.
1,The Dogs Hate It,I have 2 mini Daschunds.They hate these steps.They are to short . they willnot use them.We are sending back.My dog will not use at all....
3,PupSTEP plus pet stairs,"The item was cracked and missing a piece at the top on delivery. Not very satisfied with the condition of the product on arrival, but the actual product works well for my senior dog."
3,Good for very small dogs,"The steps are very small, so I would recommend only for dogs under eight pounds."
5,Works great once your dog likes it!,"The steps are very sturdy and work well once your dog is trained to use them. I own an overweight beagle who struggles and needed to be lifted onto the bed. It took lots of treats and praise, but now uses them and works great. We are still practicing going down on them...but seems like they will work great!"
5,dog steps,"I bought the steps because my elderly dog has a dodgy knee. It could also be because hes overweight, but I prefer to think of is as muscle haha. He has trouble jumping on the bed at times and the steps are great for him to climb up to it. Took him a while to go anywhere near them but a bit of bribery (food always works with Charlie). Hes up and down them all the time now so Im very happy with the product."
1,Plastic piece of crap,"This item was returned immediately. It was steep and cheap. There was no way my dog was going to use it. Amazon, however, was great about the return."
5,Great steps!,"These are perfect for my daughter's tiny chihuahua to be able to get up on the bed. I also love that they fold for storage! They are nice looking, lightweight and a great value."
2,pup step,"The steps were not as tall as I thought they would be. It would be helpful if on the size you put height, width, depth.The steps were a lot steeper than I thought they would be and there was no traction on the steps and it scared my dog."
4,Fine for my wife's dogs,Yes this PupStep is light weight- it works great for a 20# dog. The first PupStep arrived with a crack in one side even though the shipping (original PupStep)box was undamaged. An email to Amazon had a replacement on my doorstep in 3 days (over a weekend) at no charge; I used the Amazon prepaid return label to send back the broken original one. Happy with the PupStep and Amazon's customer service.CKCSs in VA
4,Chihuahua won't use stairs - yet.,"The stairs are exactly what I expected. No problem there. The only problem is getting my stubborn, stupid ? Chihuahua to use them. Yes, I've used treats and coaxing. Nothing seems to work. I have had them for two weeks and am not giving up."
3,Ehhh,"The steps are too narrow, it's like it is more difficult for my dachshund to use it than to just jump. We are trying really hard to get him to NOT jump, but I really don't think these are helping. My mothers dogs had the same issue with it, so, she got one that had deeper steps, and her animals really like it."
5,These steps meet all mu expectations.,These steps are light and easy handled. They are very study for a small animal. Twenty pounds or less. These steps worked very well for our little Chester [Poodle].
2,Didn't work for my dog,My dog was afraid of the steps because they're not deep enough. Have you ever tried walking up or down stairs that are too shallow? Not a pleasant experience. My dog didn't like it either:) sorry I had to send this back and I'll go back to picking my dog up myself.
4,Getting up,"Purchased Solvit PupStep for our MinPin through Amazon.com. At first she was a little reluctant to use them, but she took to them with no problem. Our bed is so high, she couldn't get on without assistance and now she is on her own. I looked online at different ones and after researching ordered these. They have met our needs."
4,It's a great buy,"It is light weight for anyone to lift. It's about 7lbs. Folds down where you can store in a closet, under a bed, or any small space. My bed, a king size, sat pretty hit off the floor but the steps came about 2 inches short of the top which was great. I wouldn't recommend for a pet over 30lbs because there isn't enought room between each step to allow your pet to climb properly. I have a cockerspaniel who is 25lbs. He was slightly intimadated by the steps because I live in a ranch with no steps at all but if your pet is okay in climbing steps, I would recommend this product to you. Great for Cats too!!"
2,Solvit PupStep,Serves the purpose but is rather cheap materials and not as sturdy as I thought it would be. Wobbles quite a bit which make our dog hesitant to use. If I bought again I would get a ramp instead. Seller did expedite service and delivery.
4,Revelation: God's gift of hope,This book has been a good reflection about the book of Revelation in the Bible. It enhances well the bible study.
3,"Good product, nice to have something for the Expansion Slot!","I don't have an issue with the lack of the power supply or AC adapter because I seem to collect them, and PS aftermarket ones with the typical #2 tip which works with HP, is very common.The issue I have is that the thick cord has frayed a bit near where it attaches to the body of the Docking Station, which has made me nervous. This happended in only a few months of use, but is probably my fault to a degree as I was demanding the sort of flexibilty that the AC adapter cord provides. In other words, I was moving the cord much in the way in terms of repositioning ability, as the ac adapter provides and not as a relatively stationary device as it was intended.Simply stated. I was hoisting it around, typically as I would lay on my back, and place the laptop on my belly and compute and surf for hours, then put the notebook down beside me, and twist the cable, then hoiste it back on my tummy."
3,HP Quickdock,"Product totally met my needs for price quoted. Wish HP would wake up and add HDMI output, but otherwise worth it."
4,Mostly great product,"The dock is a great idea and it does what it what is suppose to; however, in my situation I need a longer cord from the dock to the laptop and I can't seem to find one. The product ends up being less useful to me because of that. At the very least there should be an accessory that can be purchased that will extend the cable's length. If you don't have that problem you will probably like this product a lot."
4,Simple Dock does what it needs to,"I bought this docking station to simply interface with my television, stereo, external hard drive, and Gyration wireless mouse and keyboard. The plug is a little difficult at times to line up, but the dock successfully interfaces with all of the above devices without any trouble - and gives a home to the myriad cords and connections. As has been implied in other reviews, HP's tech support seems to know nothing about this device or its capabilities (I contacted them to try to resolve a few questions I had before I purchased it). It does not come with a power supply, which would make it it even more useful, but doesn't require power except from the laptop for the tasks I am using it for. I simply leave the laptop plugged in on its own power supply or run it on battery."
2,"Over priced, does not work well at times","BRIEFLY, THIS DOCKING STATION IS NOT GREAT.It does not have or come with a power supply and you must use your laptop AC plug for power. That means you will have to lug it back and forth with you if you use this at work and use your laptop at home too or vice versa. Unless you want to spend another $50 to buy an additional AC adapter!!! Another great HP screw over!!! After all, isn't the point of a docking station to make it easy for you to use your laptop in multiple places and by not having to plug and unplug multiple cables???Do you have a DV4000? This dock does not pass video through that model either, as well as on some other models even though HP says it does. HA!I think the universal dock with video by Kensington would be a better choice and you can find it cheaper."
2,What is Quick About It?,"The entire purpose of a docking station, in my opinion, is to be able to quickly connect your computer to other peripherals without having to continuously plug in power. Since this unit requires you to use a separate power adapter, it is tedious to use, since you will still need to plug and unplug your adapter into this in order to use it. You will need to have an extra adapter (i.e., spend more money), in order to ""quickdoc."" Right now, I have to crawl under my desk to retrieve my power cord when I need to carry my computer, which means I am doing this at least twice a day. I just want to plug in and plug out the computer and be done with it. I am not happy."
4,"Power supply issue no big deal, but computer fails to sleep when docked","I'm generally very pleased and this dock has eliminated our need for desktop PC. Yes, the dock is missing a power supply, but an easy work around is to run a 3 prong extension cord up to the docking station so that you can easily unplug the laptop's original power supply when you need to take it with you. The dock has worked great for us except that the computer will not go to sleep automatically. It's mysterious and the settings say it should shut itself off, but you have to explicitly power off the computer each time."
2,glorified extention cable,"i purchased this with the intent of using the second vga port to have two external monitors. i have done the same thing with a dell laptop/dock combination in the past and really liked that setupunfortunately this is really just a glorified extension cable that only copies whatever the laptop vga port has. the description is very misleading because it says you can extend your viewing with an external monitor but it fails to mention that it won't actually let you use two independent vga ports at onceit's nice to have the extra usb ports but that's about it. even the ethernet port is just an extension of the built in port, you can see the link/activity lights on the laptop blinking when the cable is really plugged into the dockif you do move your laptop around a lot then this is nice for getting all it hooked up quickly but if your laptop is stationary just save yourself some money and get a usb hub or look into a usb-vga adapter"
1,"Pretty, but pretty useless as well","I purchased one of these for my HP DV-1000 laptop, which was notes to have ""some reduced functionality"" when I purchased it. It should have been written ""almost no funtionality."" Practically none of my peripherals work in the expansion USB ports, except for one thing (Hauppauge WinTV-HVR950), which isn't supposed to work with a USB expansion dock, but it works just fine. Other things (printer, scanner, digital camera, et.al.) refuse to work.I had a spare power brick from another computer that gave up the ghost, so I didn't have to shell out for a spare one, but most people will either have to come up with another $50 for a spare or lug their power supply with them if they want to use their laptop away from the docking station.I wouldn't buy it again."
3,A New Look,"The Art of Dying is a grippling look at an artists' colony in Southern California. It includes an intriguing Christian heroine who doesn't draw the line where love is concerned and a British hero who can't remember who he is. Fascinating minor characters like the twins, Selena and Serena, and Detective Sergeant Hogsworth make this book a pleasure to read. It held my attention to the end and the end was satisfying.Nina Coombs Pykare"
3,Actually a little disappointed,"I bought this sewing guide looking for the advanced time-saving construction techniques used in the garment industry. Sadly, I didn't find them in this book, despite the glowing reviews. It is a good textbook and reference manual on basic sewing. The information is clearly presented with excellent and plentiful illustrations. However, the skills depicted are ones I mastered quite a while ago. I will keep this book in place of others in my library, but this was an expensive experiment. I would not recommend this book to anyone over an intermediate skill level."
5,Wade,"An excellent book for both the beginner and professional sewers. The sewing techniques/instructions are clear and concise. Mrs. Crawford included lots of details on sewing machines, required notions, etc. I only wish that the book came in hard cover form, instead of soft cover.. Highly recommend."
2,A Guide to Fashion Sewing,"It took two, people, to figure out what one illustrations, and we still got it wrong, need better explannation on the visuals."
3,No Photos! All Black and White,"I recently returned to sewing after years of being away from it. I was looking for some books to look at as a refresher as well as learn some more advanced techniques. I checked out 7 books from the library including this one and this was my least favorite. It's pretty basic, offered nothing that several of the other books didn't but primarily, because there were no photos. All the images were illustrations in gray tones. It seemed more like a text book and intimidating. Not fun and inspiring. The information was good but the lack of photos and color made it intimidating and I didn't want to read it."
5,Geat Book!,Wonderful book as I saw it at my friend house and ordered mine.Good images and easy to understand! Recommend for beginners andother to refresh the knowledge.
5,great book,i absolutley loved this.... if you are into greek phlosophy this is a must have! it explores al different kinds of points of views every one of them strong. i really recomend this book!
4,well worth the money!,"wow! i was surprised big-time.... i use to have a four channel mixer, i decided to remove it, and replace it with the gemini pa-700 pre amp... as stated, it sounded a whole lot better than the former mixer i did use... with the options of knobs in front to set the sound your way is nice, bass boost switch and tape monitor switch is good to have... anyway, i would highly grade this pre-amp as a very good one from gemini.... i looked at different pre-amps but the set-up and quality was not there, compared to this one... anyone whom wishes to up-grade.. go for it.... with the gemini pa-7000..........."
3,Nice Pre-Amp,"This unit replaced a very old 10 band EQ that sat on top of the amp rack. Now, just 1.5 rack spaces and a nice clean sound."
2,Rebranded cocktail sauce,"Not bad, but be warned that it tastes like a cocktail sauce. If you have anything else tomato flavored in your chili this will put it over the top and cause your chili to taste like it should be eaten with defrosted shrimp."
3,okay,It was more difficut than it was fun but overall I enjoyed it. I hope other people can enjoy making models as much as I do.
1,"Following some of this ""instruction"" could get you killed","I can't begin to describe how bad some if this instruction is. The first thing I noticed was it looks like two guys got together and said ""I'm out of beer money, lets take two hours and shoot a video"". Really poor production quality. NO instructor, at least in the USA would have a student concealed carry a firearm that does not have a round in the chamber. All that racking the slide crap after the draw is utter nonsense. There are numerous other technical problems with what they are teaching. Please seek real instruction from a more qualified source than these two experts. The life you save may be yours. If you want a comparison to a really good video, look at the Magpul series."
5,A Great Resource,"Not as slick of a production like Magpul or Panteao but every bit as informative. I like the fact that it provides tactics for those who carry their pistol in condition three (magazine in, no round in the barrel) as opposed to condition one (magazine in, live round in the barrel). Everyone should have this in their library to refer to."
2,not worth $40,"It was decent, but not worth $40 in my opinion. Maybe $10 would be appropriate for the amount of material covered and the fact that overall it was poorly directed. Could have used a little editting and reshoots for some of the obvious mistakes made by the instructors. Overall not nearly as much content as the description would lead you to believe. For example... balistics test of cover... one shot to a concrete block. Sorry... I really wanted this to be worth it, but pretty cheesy."
1,Don't buy this vacuum,"Nice vacuum if you have wall to wall carpet.If you have wall to wall tile ""like we do"" and throw rugs don't buy this vacuum.It's made to go under furniture, which it does well. But because of that you can't liftthe front of the vacuum over the leading edge of throw rugs.You have to lift the entire vacuum and place in in the middle the rug.If you get anywhere near either end of the rug it is sucked into the vacuum and you have to turn it off.When you get to the end of the rug you can't drag it back, you have to lift it.To vacuum a throw rug 20"" by 30"" you have to lift the vacuum about 8 to 10 times.3 rugs per room time 5 rooms I have to lift this vacuum over 100 times.Your back gets soar.The hose is also to short and pulls the vacuum over, if you are not really careful.This vacuum was a big letdown for us."
4,Perfect fit...,The engine mount was a perfect fit for my 98 Honda CR-V. Beck-Arnley makes parts that have earned my trust.
5,Wonderful and practical,"This book is full of wonderful activities that are practical for the preschool classroom. I found the activities to be varied, engaging and age appropriate. I appreciated that there were activities for various types of instruments as well as rhythm band. I wish there was an edition that included an audio CD, but it is pretty easy to collect music from my classroom collection to go with the activities."
3,Only the basics,"This book was not what I expected it to be. It is for someone who has no knowledge of music or rhythm. The ideas were so elementary that it was insulting to me. ""Here's a cymbal, crash it 4 times,"" etc. Recommended only for those with no knowledge of percussion or rhythm."
5,A Pre-School or Special Ed Music MUST HAVE!!!,I teach some preschool and special education Music classes and this book is WONDERFUL for them. They really like the songs and activities in the book. It's very easy and simple for the kids to do and they absolutely love the songs. I even use some of the songs in my first grade lessons.I personally highly recommend this book and looking for more just like this!
4,Handy compass for the key chain,"The compass is almost too big for the key chain, but I make it work. I was planning on getting Suunto's gem compass (bit smaller), but that was out of stock. This includes a nice thermometer; however, it is best for a ballpark reading of +-2.5 degrees. The compass includes a bezel, which could be useful if you're trying to stay on a certain heading for awhile, but I would not use this for orienteering.It is frequently useful for checking if I'm walking an unfamiliar city, or also while driving. Nice product."
1,"Clicking on ""Add to cart"" adds a different compass to the cart","The Suunto Comet is a great compass. But be careful. Check your shopping cart. As of today (12 January 2011) clicking on ""Add to cart"" adds a different compass (the Clipper, not the Comet) to the cart"
1,It's from my carelessness but...,"also from the US stubborness not to get along with international standard. Every scale is indicated by yard-pound system, not by metric, (although the product is made in Finland) and very inconvenient."
2,Stereotypically leftward leaning,"I just finished a class with the 2001-2002 edition. Part of the book is very objective, other parts fit the stereotype of leftward leaning curriculum perfectly. It gives the perception that part of the authors really attempt to be objective, but at least one author's perceptions are left of center to the point that either he/she does not realize, or else does not care how leftward his/her perception is.On balance, most of the book is pretty good, and pretty objective, but certain parts - especially the portrayals, and interpretations of events in the civil liberties, and judicial chapters will likely be more frustrating than to many of the older students who have been a part of the ""Attentive public"" for a few years. I call out these sections because these two in particular I noticed a considerable amount of editorialism put forth as objective fact."
5,Works Great,It looks great and does what it was meant to do. I got this for my hubby and he just loves it. Great product.
3,Guilty Pleasure!,"I'm a huge fan of director Russ Meyer. He was light years ahead of his time. His 1966 release contained hammy acting and a script that was raw. Whatever you do, don't take this movie seriously! ""Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" was an example of mixing erotica and action together to make an entertaining and unintentionally funny film. I couldn't help laughing throughout the film. It's one of those guilty pleasures Roger Ebert and the late Gene Siskel was talking about."
2,Cult Classic Camp,"If you're drunk or high, this movie might make sense...otherwise, ""FAUGETABOUTIT"".It does feature a excellent villain in the character of Venda. This woman is truly evil and has no redeeming characteristics whatsoever. And she is the standard Russ Meyer female, so....."
3,So-so cult film,The Bottom Line:If you need some butt-kicking women thrills you could do worse than this exploitation film from Russ Meyer (though there aren't that many such films to chose from) but don't expect it to be very good: like most cult films it's more revered for its attitude than for its bravura filmmaking.2.5/4
5,Welcome to violence-- the word and the act!,"A stunning acheivement in low-key (by today's standards) cinematic sleaze! This movie is often accused of being a live action comic book. As a comic book artist, I heartilly agree! Memorizing every frame should be a prerequisite to making comics.From the deadpan irony of John Moran's script, through Meyer's direction and cinematography to the terrifyingly sexy performances by the Pussycats-- especially Tura and Haji. This movie has a weird chemestry all its own.One of my many favorite lines has cute little Sue Bernard asking the titular psychotic go-go girl trio, ""Any of you girls care for a soft drink?"" to which uber-latina Haji responds, ""No no. We don't like'a nothin' soft-- everything we like is'a HARD!!"""
3,Camp Camp Camp,"In one of Russ Meyer's less naughty films you find the story of three tough ladies fighting for their lives. With little flesh but much suggestion this early exploitation film is a load of laughs with a bevy of beauties. Along with the fact that many music samples have been picked from this film. See if you can find them. This is a hard to find flick, but much more fun than many of today's exploitive films and less sleazy. This is simply tacky."
3,Can anyone explain to me why is this $119???,"Really guys? this better be some sort of 5 disc set w/ a couple visa & amazon gift cards, otherwise why is $119"
3,Beware of this version!!!,"Faster Pussycat is an AWESOME movie!!! Hot women, hot cars and violence!!! What more could you want? My only problem with this dvd is it won't play on my dvd player. I can only watch it on my computer. R.I.P Tura xoxo!"
5,I stand corrected!,"Dear Music Fan, I am impressed at vast amount of information you know regarding EE. I would love to know more and of course more about my brother (through the eyes of his friends). Please understand that the facts you've shared on [Amazon.com] are facts about EE before my brother joined the band and never spoke about with the family. Thanks for the info and for keeping his memory alive. How did you know I was his sister? I'm curious. Keep writing [more!!!] THANKS."
5,Save Energy Wash Your Bedding on Cold,I love this product because it allows me to save money and avoid global warming by washing my bedding on cold while killing the dust mites that make my nose stuff up at night.
2,Harsh Detergent!,"When I ordered this product, we were at our wits' end with a dust mite battle. Every night was so itchy and miserable, and I was hopeful upon finding a detergent that claimed to cleanse fabrics of these incessant pests. It seemed like all of our problems would be solved by using it. But, when I received the detergent (after waiting longer than for most shipped packages, by the way), and washing our sheets and blankets, I was severely disappointed in the product. Although the detergent seemed to strip the mites away, it also stripped color and fibers out of all of the linens, including my grandmother's handmade quilts. It also somehow caused everything to shrink, so that we couldn't even force the sheets back onto the bed without intense effort. So, overall, it got rid of the mites temporarily, but ruined everything washed in it. Now I have to spend hundreds of dollars replacing everything (the things that aren't priceless anyway)."
3,Dan's Girl,"Since babies don't came with an ""owner's manual"" they created one to help you anticipate and handle your new baby's basic needs without worry. This helpful handbook covers feeding, bathing, first aid, health childproofing, and sleeping (good luck!)Noewly revised, this book gives new parents the techniques and confidence they need."
2,"Good, but not a best book to read","Compare the costs paid and benefits gained from reading, I am sure that there are other books better than this. Most contents in this book were described in very long sentences, although they actually need only 30% of all words. Some good points are to the pictures illustrated in some chapters. My recommendation to those with limited paying capacity, you should buy Heineken's book instead. Trust me."
1,Pitiful.... Simply Pitiful,This book is terrible. The writing in it is aweful. It is vague and ambiguous. It assumes knowledge and understanding of the subject prior reading. NOT a good choice for a class text or for a beginner in epidemiology.
3,Alright,The product does keep the ipod in place and it's a much better deal that what you can get at stores such as best buy for $32.I ordered one color and received another but I did receive the package within the week.
2,Cheap!,"You get the $4.95 you paid for. The case is nice but does not cover the screen. But the clip and armband which I primarily bought it for, look cheap and function poorly. The belt ""clip"" is merely a piece of plastic that I still am not sure how to attach and the ""armband"" will not stay on while walking much less running. Do Not Buy unless you would like the case."
4,iPod Skin kit,"Product is very good, only disappointment was that it doesn't cover the screen, which I was worried about scratching. But overall I'm very pleased."
5,Fado at its best,She is so great. Some of her CDs have more of an orchestral treatment. I forgot how this one differs.No matter. I love all of her work.
4,Nice Collection of Westen TV Shows,"Westerns were the procedurals of their day, so there is a wealth of great guest stars in the episodes on this DVD. My favorite here is the very British J. Pat O'Malley's earnest attempt at a silver prospector's accent on an episode of Shotgun Slade.One of many fun things about watching dollar DVDs is finding ""hidden"" episodes. The back of the DVD lists the second-to-last entry as being an episode of Judge Roy Bean, but in actuality it is a second episode of Bonanza. A good one, too. Here's a full listing of the 9 episodes on this DVD:Bonanza - ""Day of Reckoning""The Lone Ranger - ""The Masked Rider""The Rifleman - ""Day of the Hunter""Shotgun Slade - ""Skinner's Rainbow""Annie Oakley - ""A Tall Tale""The Adventures of Jim Bowie - ""Birth of the Blade""The Deputy - ""Hard Decision""Bonanza - Unknown episode titleAdventures of Kit Carson - ""Badman of Brisco"""
3,"Nice style, poor support","The book is well written and has an approach and style that lends itself to learning GarageBand easily. It is just unfortunate that there are errors in it (things it tells you to do which do not work), and there is no web support and no way to report errata to the author or publisher - actually quite surprising these days. So it would rate higher if it were correct or had a way to provide feedback, but as it is I am left wondering if the OReilly book would have been a wiser purchase simply because they support their books."
4,Not the Prog band Pendragon!,"Oops - if you are looking for the English prog band by the same name (Clive Nolan, Nick Barret, etc.), this ain't them. My bad. This is a US (Rhode Island/Boston) traditional Celtic/Irish band... Ya know, fiddles, whistles, bodhran, etc... Fortunately, I also like traditional Celtic music so it's not at all a loss, just a temporary disappointment...Anyway, this is a disc full of reels, jigs, sea-chanties, and generally good Irish dance music. Female vocals (reminds me some of Maddy Prior from early Steeleye Span), great fiddle (the late great Johnny Cunningham guests...). If you like Cherish the Ladies, Silly Wizard, et al. you will probably enjoy this. It's well played and well-produced."
2,Got what I paid for.,"I bought this CD because I really liked one of the numbers I heard on Pandora Radio. Most of the others, however, were not that good."
1,Balsa Wood Splitter!,"Yea, I was a sucker and bought it. Don't buy this unless you plan on splitting soft wood."
2,Too light weight,"Would only work on the softest, driest pine. I welded a 20 lbs piece of round stock to the top of it; now it works."
1,Good for a paper weight,"Biggest waste of money I have ever made! It took me 16 hits, using a lot of strength with each, to split the edge off of an 8 inch long piece of soft maple. I could have split it with one stroke of a hatchet! I am extremely dissapointed.Bill NybergMarlton, New Jersey"
4,"MYSTERIOUS, MYSTERY!!","I just read this and thought it was one of the best mystery romance books ever. I figured out a little of it as I went along but was amazed at the surprise right at the end. How wonderful to write such a different type of story involving a marvelous man in a May to December romance. I loved her Raven and the Rose as well. Am about to start on her Lily and the Leopard. She is a wonderful writer. If you like good romance, a great mystery, and some very unusual characters get this book."
4,Do I Hear A Waltz?,"It was a surprise to me to find such an old title--over a decade--on display for recent purchase. But when I started reading this soft, dreamy novel that was the only time I checked for the date. It's because in the current climate of hard edged, all purpose alpha female leads, this novel featured a clever, ultra feminine lead. Wafting about as an artist's model, draped with beautiful fabrics by open windows with soft breezes coming in, this heroine was definatly not of the more recent batch. Still it was refreshing. The male lead is older, but wiser and still not afraid to compete with younger and more foolish ""boys"" for the hand of the ""lady"". A lovely book to comfortably read and enjoy with few surprises."
2,Lord of the Night Not my favorite Susan Wiggs book,"She is my new favorite author. I have been reading the fire trilogy. Started out with the last one Firebrand. Could not put it down. Lord of the night is about a beautiful young girl who is a painter. She was living in a convent and has decided to become a courteson to pay for her painting. She meets a venecian chief of police. He is very stodgy, old, and manipulative. He is not my favorite male hero. Everytime you start to like him he does something stupid again! Hard to get into this book. The foreign words make the book hard to follow. I feel as though I am reading a foreign book at times. Maybe you will like it better."
4,VERY NICE LAPTOP / NOTEBOOK,"At first I was also dubious of the purchase. However, once I installed a few software and deleted the many useless softwares that it came with I was very much satisfied.Although it came with only 512mb of memory, I installed Adobe CS2, the full 7 or 8 programs for graphics professionals and it works fine. Of course, the best feature, and I have searched around for this, is the incredible bright and crisp screen. It does not even compare with the HP Xbrite, Toshiba Trubrite, and Gateway Ultrabrite.The negative aspects are the standard battery that comes with the machine that only lasts about 2 hours and the weak graphic card and integrated speakers (but, if you use earphones you get a better experience).The best reason I like this computer personally is because I got a great deal at Office Depot for less than $699 on a weekly special."
5,Works perfect,"This litter box works perfect, I don't use the included door though. It is a weird off-clear/yellowish color but as long as I scoop every 2 days or so (I only have 1 cat), there is not a smell. The clips to attach the top to bottom are hard to click but why would you need to carry around a litter box anyway, my top sits securely onto the bottom anyway so there is no need to clamp it. The plastic is pretty sturdy, I have had this box for almost a year now and still like it, my cat seems to as well."
3,Some plusses ... one big negative,"We really like the design and the use of a harder plastic material for this covered litter box. However, for some reason, both our male siamese & female tortoiseshell cats find a way to regularly pee out through the back edge and onto the floor from where the top meets the bottom section of the box. (And the two halves are fully engaged when this happens). YMMV"
2,Generic,"This album is not his best. Night Grooves is excellent, so I was very disappointed with this one. The classic ""Cause we've ended as lovers"" is the one real highlight. If you like jazz that is not overly sweet and bland, and has some edge, try Night Grooves instead."
5,HHM Keeps getting better,"Whoo! With the addition of Leslie at gutiar, they just keep getting better and better! Can't wait to hear more from them. The songs are great and Celia's voice is as beautiful as ever."
4,Gumwrapper Curb rocks.,"I enjoy the Blue Dogs and the Pat Macgee Band, but Gumwrapper Curb is by far the best band on this album. Small, talented bands like this one need your support. Please buy this album and support up and coming music. Go Gumwrapper Curb."
2,Should be titled Grand Street Cryers and misc.,"This CD should get 2 stars out of a possible of 19 because it has only two good tracks on the whole thing: both by the Grand Street Cryers. I don't know who they are and have never heard of them before, but I bought this CD because a friend recommended I listen to Trish Murphy and instead, I fell in love with GSC. Since then, I've purchased all their albums. My recommendation: save your money and buy the two Grand Street Cryers' CDs instead."
1,Broken in 1 month,"I purchased one about a month ago, and this morning it broke. There has been no extraordinary use of this unit, only daily clipping on and off of my belt. The hinge mechanism is extremely low quality. The price of this accessory is great, but you definitely get what you pay for. Now instead of 1, I have 2 pieces of crap."
3,Not as Gripping as the First Book,"The first book in the series had me excitedly waiting to see the conclusion of the story between Brierly and Melfallen, as well as finding out what happens with her daughter Megan and the other witches.However, although the second book was good, it couldn't hold my attention and I usually read a book of this length in 1 or 2 days. It kept switching back and forth between characters, introducing some new people out of the blue. Plus, there was not enough of what I think is the main character, Brierly. I wanted to know more of what she was going through.Still, it was an interesting book, maybe just a little hard to keep going at times."
2,Painful,This was a strange and difficult book to read. It may be a literary wonder but it reminded me of a book in high school that you were required to read. Every line ... every paragraph ... every page became painful. I was so happy to finish. I read the book because it is in 1001 Books to Read Before You Die ... I definitely could have lived my life never reading this book and been okay with that!
1,Review of IF ON A WINTER'S NIGHT A TRAVELLER,"I think the reader would have to be smoking whacky tobaccy to get anything out of this book. The White Pages would have a more interesting plot. And to those who assert that the book is esoteric, therefore only the intellectually elite will be able to resonate with it, I say CODSWALLOP! I'm all for brave, bold outside-the-box literary attempts but this book is completely outside comprehension. Words fail me when it comes to describe my distaste for this novel, indeed in much the same way that words failed Mr. Calvino I hasten to add. I'm disappointed that I had to give this book one star. Zero stars would have been more appropriate."
4,Damn you Calvino...,"Italo Calvino has surpassed himself. He has taken the ""relating to the character"" feeling to new heights, by making everyone who picks this books up, a character of the book. He takes you to the edge around 10 odd times, in 100 beginning sof 10 unrelated stories, but holds you back from plunging into the story line. He gets you so frustrated...no thts not the word...mmm ok I will use the word, but with no negative connotation...He pulls the ground from under you with every turn of the page. A must read for anyone passionate about reading for reading's sake."
5,be prepared for a journey,Read carefully and you'll find that you are traveling -- Calvino takes you for a ride in this one. It's fun and intellectual. And Calvino is a master at the art of telling a good story.
5,profound fun,"At one level this is a coming of age story, but it is far deeper than its surface adventures suggests. The procession of wise beings who introduce the hero to altered states, western thought and spiritual sexuality are well worth the read.A brilliant synthesis of wisdom and a good story besides."
2,Safe but weak,"I live in an apartment and needed a paint stripper that was non toxic since I have to do my handy work in the livingroom. I needed to strip the paint from a 60"" wide windowsill, and two flat panels of my radiator cover (30"" x 25""). I did everything according to directions, covered the applied stripper with plastic and waited overnight. The stripper took off one layer of latex paint. So I applied a second coat and wrapped the panels in plastic and waited 18 hours. The stripper took off another layer of latex paint, but the 3 layers of oil-based paint underneath was intact. I had to repeat this process 4 more times and used 3 quarts of the stripper before the paint was completely removed. This was quite costly, made a tremendous mess that I had to live with for almost a week, and during the process I regretted having started the project.If you are taking off one layer of latex paint this stripper is fine. For anything else, I think another poduct is needed."
4,Don't judge a book by its cover...,"Hahaha!! This anime DOES keep its sickness like the true and wonderful South Park, but... it's too bazaar for any human to handle... but if you happen to run upon this... Be prepared for the worst... because your going to laugh your ass off of this crazy anime, and after watching it once... you know your hooked... if not... well... use it as a freesbie for your dog!!Ja'"
2,What were they thinking?,"I absolutley love the Ping Pong club. Own the first VHS volume, and now the DVD. I was shocked when upon putting in the (first) Ping Pong club DVD, It starts at Episode 23. What the?! One would think the first DVD collection for a series would start at the beginning of said series.. Not towards the end. Aside from that, I've been having numerous problems with the subtitles not working. Many instances where they're talking and Subtitles do not appear. Often you can skip bac kand watch the scene again and said subtitles will appear. This happens alot. and it's absolutley infuriating. Happens on both my DVD rom drive and RCA stand alone DVD player. The English dub is horribly bad. And The video quality is adequate at best.Proceed with extreme caution."
3,"Fun an entertaining, if a bit predictable.",I really liked this show when it was on Kids WB. I don't know if this is all of Season 1 or not but it was a good selection of episodes. Some of them did seem to repeat the same theme/story over and over and were pretty predictable for the most part but this is a kid's show so I take that for what it's worth.One gripe - based on the cover art I thought one of the DVD's had episodes from Season 2 since it featured Kon-El in the cover graphic. This package is only from Season 1.
5,Fun,Both my boys love watching this series. For some reason they never get bored and laugh in all the same areas. I don't like to own many of these shows but this one is good enough to have in your collection.
1,Not really satisfied,"I have had several great experiences ordering items, this is the first time I was not satisfied. Quality of product was not very good."
4,"Lord Taylor lives the ""British Dream.""","I was quite impressed with Lord Taylor's accomplishments. From humble beginnings in Britain to the House of Lords, he gave us his version of the ""British Dream.""He also gave me some valuable insights into the issues of race and politics in Britain. I was moved by his method of reaching out and making friends with racists, rather than giving in to hate. I believe this is the best way to bridge the racial divide. I would love to meet him one day."
1,It is just a bag of rocks. It has no effect,I bought it two weeks ago and it has been in my basement since then. It absolutely did nothing.
2,Case + Car + mini charger,"After a long wait (out of stock?), I finally received the product from iGoneMobile (could have been 1-2 days faster but they were very approachable). The car and wall chargers work great. Unfortunately, the wallet case (the most important part of the order) does not fit the Cingular 8525/HTC TyTN as advertised. I am contacting them to send it back for exchange and will let you know what happens next."
5,All of their albums are great!,"I've got all their albums now, including Sugareen and Jawbreaker. They are fun, energetic, and are better than most of the stuff on the airwaves. Their live shows are great. Buy it!"
4,Gotta Love it,"Great sounds, From Michigan, I cant take it out of my car. This band was touring with verve pipe and the xgames last year. keep up the good work guys."
2,Live Energy not present in studio,"Before ever listening to ""Six Ways From Sunday"" I saw 19Wheels live and was impressed by the energy on stage. The guitar was thick and outgoing, and the vocalist got the crowd going. Despite their concert, the album is nothing special. They spout out standard alternative riffs drowned in distortion, especially on ""Come on Jenny"" and try so hard at an honest song with ""Good Enough"" and then at chorus fall to an obnoxous whine. A religous country song is thrown in at the end, for anyone who is looking for something to put them to sleep...quick. The one song worth hearing, ""Colorodo"", is a standard pop-alternative-rock song just as you'd expect it, but it wont annoy you like the rest of the cd will."
3,Does Not fit all electric guitars,"The case is good, but it is stated to fit all guitars. It does Not fitthe larger Gretsch Guitars such as the G5445t model."
3,Kinda Fit-All,"I bought this case for storage of a variety of different guitars but primarily had a Gibson Les Paul in mind for it. Turns out the Les Paul is too long for the case and the headstock rubs on the top of the lining, the first row of tuners hit the inside lining as well. It will ""fit"" but I'm not sure I'd trust leaving it in there. I've not had trouble with other guitars in the case, though. It was a nice fit for a couple different PRS SE models. The neck is cradled nicely inside the case and there seems to be very little movement of the guitars inside. The padding and lining inside seems fairly nice. Overall the outer case seems to be made of average materials and the locks/latches on the front seem very cheap, but I guess you can't expect a lot for a case in this price range. Had I to do it again I would not buy this case and would probably look into an SKB. If you're looking to put a Les Paul in this unit look elsewhere but it should get the job done for most other electric guitars."
4,Awesome Case! A little light.,"This is a great case that fits most guitars. Right now I have my Fender Stratocaster laying in it.I also have a Schecter that fits in it too. I haven't tried my les paul though, but I'm guessing it would work too.The inside is very soft and doesn't scratch the guitar at all. The outside is pretty durable, but i wouldn't trust taking it around everywhere.I just use it for storage in my house. I have another Gator Case that i bought about 2 years ago and its much more durable and safe.All in all, if you are just using this case for storage inside then this is the case for you.But if you are a traveller, I would spend the extra money and get the more durable one."
2,Too Small,I have 8 different electric guitars - all shapes and sizes and this case only fit 2 of them - one of which is a cheap student guitar. The Fit-All designation is not that accurate. Its only about an inch or so off in either direction - I can never understand why case manufacturers don't just go the extra mile. The case is actually very thick though - which I suppose may be good in terms of protection but the aesthetics leave a bit to be desired. Overall build is good - I'm just bitter about the Fit.
2,Doesn't Fit,I bought this to put my Dean Custom 350 electric guitar in . The Dean is about 1 and a half inches too long so the case won't fit the guitar . Also one of the latches was installed crooked so it is slightly hard to close / latch . Also the case is open inside . No compartment lid to keep wrenches and accessories from loosly moving around inside the case scratching / dinging up the guitar finish . I am now in the process / hassle of trying to send it back . I have to pay the shipping on a product that I was told would fit .
1,Does not fit Gibson Epiphone Les Paul/Requires to pay mailing costs to return,"I recently purchased the Gator guitar case advertised to fit ""almost"" any guitar type. However, almost does not cover several guitar types, including most Gibsons.Furthermore, the company (Zzounds) required payment of the shipping costs in order to return the case, which were approximately $15-20, plus extra penalties for opening the guitar box. These costs were not mentioned prior to the purchase.I am really dissatisfied by the treatment of the company."
3,"Aware II is a bit bland, but still worth checking out","I bought this CD at the HORDE fest in 1996. The Edwin McCain, and Shannon Worrell (Dave Matthews sings backup) songs are wonderful, as is the rest of the CD. My only conplaint is that it gets a little bland, but it's definetely a CD worth checking out."
5,Delivered on time. Works perfectly,So amazed that I could finally found a charger for my camera's battery that I can afford. Love it!
5,one of the best sitcoms out there right now,"Where to start?! All around great writing, characters, actors, and comic timing. I've already watched and rewatched! Looking forward to the complete second season.The product shipped very quickly and came in great new condition."
5,Modern Family Season 1,"This is simply the funniest show on television. I had only seen one episode prior to purchasing the DVD so I really didn't know what to expect. When I cracked the case and started watching from the beginning, I was hooked FAST. This show is successful to me on so many fronts. There are tons of characters that you just can't get enough of. The situations for each of the families are unique and fresh and really, simply put, FUNNY. I also like the fact that there isn't a lot of sexuality or even references to sex. The show is very clean with only slight nods toward the adult humor that most sitcoms seem to rely on. This makes the show a great one to watch with ANY audience or age group and it also makes a great background show for parties and get togethers. I really can't get enough of the show, and there are a lot of extras on the DVD like bloopers and such for fans of the show. Go buy it today!"
5,Full of laughs and heart,"It's a great show! It's fun, witty, clever and I look forward to every episode."
2,Bad disc,"One of the discs in the case can't be read. Kinda makes buying the ""complete"" first season pointless. Probably just a glitch."
4,Funny Family Entertainment,"I usually stay away from the network sitcoms with the fake laugh-tracks so resisted watching this one as well despite several recommendations. Well, finally I got to it and have not been disappointed. The mix of characters is wonderful and it is somewhat true to life. A good comment on family life. And best of all, no laugh track! One is not needed. Highly recommended."
5,Modern Family is the BEST!,"This is my favorite episode of the first season: ""Run For Your Wife""The kids go back to school (except Phil)Phil challenges Claire to a raceCameron dresses up Lily and photographs her impersonating Diana Ross (during the ""Ghetto years"")Mitchell still isn't feeling comfortable being a Dad and Cameron encourages some one-to-one time with Mitchell dancing with Lily to his favorite songThey take Lily to the doctor due to an dance related injury.""Fa"" soup is a subject of a discussion with the Asian MDCameron becomes hysterical(and hysterically funny) when they accidentally lock Lily in the car.And THAT just happens in the first half of the show!No wonder they were nominated for so many Emmys (and won several). Their sophomore year is just as great as their first season.Enjoy! Laugh!"
5,Hilarious!,We watch this during lunch and it makes a hectic workday that much more enjoyable! Can't wait to get season 2!
5,Love Modern Family,I received this as a gift last Christmas so bought another for a friend who also loves the show. Having this DVD set of the first season on hand was great this summer when I needed a good laugh. I plan to purchase the second season too. This show is great even if you have seen the episodes when originally aired--they are fun to watch again and again.
5,One of the best shows!,"This is such an orignial, funny, poignant show that keeps getting better. I plan to purchase the other seasons as well, but got started with season one as a Christmas gift for a family member. Well worth the price!"
2,"Rating for DVD, not the show","Let me start by stating: I LOVE this show, I think it's the best show on TV, and I think it deserves all the awards. There is nothing I don't love about this show.However, I'm extremely disappointed in the quality of these DVDs. Whoever made them did an awful job, at least as I try to run them on the computer. They refuse to run in any program other than this bizarre one bundled with them which ends up freezing my computer ever few minutes. They're also extremely quiet, to the point where I can hardly hear them with my computer at max volume. The video quality in general seems low for a DVD, I feel like I'm watching a VHS or something. Not to mention the 5+ minutes of trailers that play at the beginning of the DVD.The only reason I rated this two stars is because I can't stand to give Modern Family only one star, it's such a perfect show. But these DVDs are the worst."
5,Unbelievably funny!,I really can't say anything that hasn't already been said. I've got all of my friends and family watching now. Even my teen sons laugh at the humor. It's about time something this good was on network tv.
5,Funniest Show on tv,"I had heard good things about the show, so I bought season 1 to try it out. It was even better than I expected! Very funny, smart, and sweet. Loved every episode!"
1,Review of the overall product,"The CD's did not work properly as they skipped and wouldn't let me enjoy the show properly. To the credit of the manufacterer who I ordered from, they gave me an immediate refund."
1,Boring,"I thought this show was a BLAST after reading the reviews and knowing it won an Emmy for best Comedy Series. So I bought it willing I was going to have a great time watching it.However, this is the WORST show ever from ABC. It's pure TORTURE to see an entire episode.First, the format is annoying by the DANGLING camera swings which go continuously.Second, for the fact that it shows the pathetic life of 3 pathetic families.Third, the script is obvious and ultra-cliche.Actors are very good, though the lines, production and script are hideous. Try to watch the pilot before you buy this."
5,Hysterical!,Very funny take on all the possibilities for the composition of today's modern California family. No stone left unturned and a few surprises along the way. The whole family loves it.
4,Modern family,"I bought the first season used for a present. I love this show, I got it faster than expected and haven't watched them yet but they were all there and it looked brand new."
5,The best new comedy of 2009,The best new comedy of 2009. Each new episode funnier than the last. The second season is even funnier than the first. Not too heavy on stereotypes. Family friendly too.
3,Has its moments,"Some of the situations are great comedic fun, others don't always hit the mark for me. I'm hoping there is improvement over time with the next seasons."
5,LOVE it!,"I never watched Modern Family until this past Sunday afternoon, then I started watching it and finished every single episode that's been released so far (42+) by Wednesday. Yes, it's that good.This show is hilarious,the characters are lovable (and even relate-able to some extent). The lines are great and it's clean for the most part (good for the family). I had a blast watching every one of the episodes. And as funny as it is, there are great principles about family, sharing, relationships, etc. in it too, though that is not necessarily what people watch it for.It's a little like The Office in that the camera sometimes cuts away to a scene with just one or two of the characters talking to the camera, sharing their true thoughts and feelings. Modern Family also takes advantage of using awkward situations like The Office. I love both.I'd definitely recommend this TV show if you've never watched it before, you can check out a couple of episodes on Hulu first."
4,I laughed so hard I cried!,"I have only seen a few episodes of Modern Family before watching this box set of Season 1. It is a comedy show about a family and somehow watching them makes my family's craziness not so bad! First off I knew I would like this show because it stars Ed O'Neill who was the famous ""Al Bundy"" in Married With...Children. He plays the dad and step-dad of the show and is married to a much younger woman! All the characters though are crazy and funny and make me laugh, which after a long day of taking care of my own kids I need a few laughs! There is so much going on that it is hard to get bored and hard not to laugh! I love that it is multi-racial and the characters are different so the show does stand out as a comedy. There is adoption, a step child, a gay son, and something for everyone."
5,MODERN FAMILY FIRST SEASON,"JUST WHAT MY GRANDDAUGHTER WANTS AND AT A TERRIFIC PRICE, VERY PROMPT ARRIVAL. A GIFT, UNOPENED YET. AM SURE SHE WILL LIKE IT."
1,Damaged,One disc skips through most of the seasons and the last disc does not even play. Very dissapointed. Can I exchange?
1,Cheesy and awkward,I was surprised that this show has so many favorable ratings. I thought it was cheesy and awkward. Some parts were funny and the concept of the show is great but the execution is horrible. I feel like they exagerated all the stereotypes of the characters and none of the relationships seemed believable. Waste of my time.
1,"Great show, poor video quality","I love this show, but this streaming quality is horrible. I don't even think it is 480p. I stopped watching it halfway through the pilot episode (first episode)!"
5,Modern family series,This is our new favorite show and it's great to have all the episodes on one CD. Buy this if you want to relax and laugh.
5,Hilarious show!! Even better without the commericals...,"Started watching this show a couple episodes into the first season and from there I was hooked! This is one of those shows that anyone can relate to, because everyone has some quirky family members that don't fit the typical mold of a family they used to show on tv comedies."
4,I thought I bought the whole season,but if I did I only got the pilot which was terrific but less than what I thought I was getting
5,"5 stars for the show, 1 for the video quality","My wife and I loved the show, it was hilarious and pretty clean! However, the first time we tried to watch it the server wouldn't connect, so we waited a few days and then the video image was grainy on full screen. The image quality improved when the pop-out was used but then the sound was lagging the video for the entire episode. We'll be going elsewhere to watch our instant shows/movies."
5,We loved this season!,We started watching this show in its third season and wanted to see the series from the beginning. My daughter and I actually turned watching season 1 into an all day marathon.
1,There's Nothing Funny About This Show,"Of all the lame shows on TV today this one is the lamest, by a long-shot. It's boring, politically correct, extremely cliched, and utterly pathetic. The comedy is tired and low-key and is never irreverent or groundbreaking.This show gives a tri-perspective of three families. One is gay, the second is interracial, and the last is straight and white, albeit they're all pathetic and cliched, especially the gay one, it seems like they're just there for the sake of being politically correct. How is this funny?Of course like almost every comedy in the last 10 years the male lead characters are portrayed as the most ignorant and gullible, except the gay ones of course. The females are slutty and unoriginal.What happened to the good old days when gay shows were statistically normal and there was one funny, original gay comedy on TV, i.e. Will And Grace.And did I mention cliched, hell even the DVD cover rips off Party of Five."
4,good stuff,This product came in better condition than I expected. It is an awesome show and Amazon always has decent deals. I couldn't pass it up. It was gift for my wife's birthday and she loved it. Keep making it happen Amazon.
2,Disc was bad,The first disc did not work properly. It skipped and looked like there was something wrong with it even though it was new.
2,HUH?,"I'm at a loss here. I truly cannot understand why people like this series. It abounds in cliches and silliness. The characters behave absolutely stupidly, according to their pre-determined character guidelines. There are no surprises. I expect one of two things in a series: either the unexpected to capture my interest in what could happen next, or a reflection of real life, so that I can laugh at how the writers captured the real thing. There is neither in this series."
2,THEY NEED TO WORK ON THE HUMOR BIG TIME,I heard a lot of good things about this one but found the humor mediocre almost like it was dumbed down for the generic masses. By the second episode I lost interest. I did feel the backgrounds were interesting but more humor would have helped a great deal.WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; HUMOR: D minus; MY GRADE: C to C plus.
5,Great Show,Hands down one of the best comedies on television. The cast is amazing and the writing phenomenal. Cameron is the best with his quick wit and great timing.
3,They don't play from this one at shows...,"I see the naysayers' reviews of Parachute are not popular! For sure, Guster is one of my favorite bands and I have all of their albums. (And yup, L&GF is probably their best, or maybe Keep It Together, or Easy Wonderful). For me, however, Parachute got retired permanently. I tried, I really did, to give it a fair shot. I can certainly understand other people liking or loving it; but to me, it's fairly nondescript and lacking warmth. Guster has said that they don't play songs off this album at shows, and I'm guessing the reason is: they don't like it much, either. Just a guess. Nonetheless, if you like the song samples, you'll probably like the CD, so go for it."
3,Go to LOST AND GONE FOREVER,"Guster's PARACHTE is good (the standout track is ""Window""), and shouldn't be overlooked for its unique use of percussion instruments, but LOST AND GONE FOREVER is absolutely phenomenal, with utterly priceless gems such as ""What You Wish For,"" ""Happier,"" and ""Two Points For Honesty."""
5,Parachute over me...,"Guster is one of the best bands out there. If you liked Goldfly, you have to get this one. They have a great melodic blend. This is some powerful music."
4,Great Album!,"I too went to school at Tufts with these boys, and I can recall many a party where they were the featured band. Their original demo tape's songs were fantastic and they can be found(in updated form) on this album. Great stuff, and not as polished as their following two albums."
5,"Fast Moving, Harmonious, Acoustic Alchemy!!","Guster's beautiful blend of voices, acoustic guitars, and charging bongoes combine to make this CD quite an enjoyable experience to listen to. Their lyrics expound on love and life, and are poetry in their own right. With vocals that remind one of Vertical Horizon, or Jackopierce, this first album is a definite must have for anyone wanting to add a simply awesome, memorable CD to their music collection!"
5,One of the Best CD's in the World,"This CD is so awesome that it is hard to find words to describe it. Even though it was the first album Guster released, it was the last one I listened to all of the way through. It is really hard to choose my favorite Guster album, but I feel this may be it. I'm not going to use pretentious musical terms to describe Parachute. Instead I will simply say, this CD will dry your tears and make you remember why you want to live."
4,Gusterific!,"Wow, if you ever are going to call yourself a music lover you must first call yourself a Guster fan. I just found out about this group (three guys from Boston, MA who met @ Tufts University) this year, and already I cannot imagine life without them. Though Parachute is but their first album, and as all 1st's are its not their greatest, (it's kinda like losing your virginity, a 1st album that is, the other 2 are just highly evolved masterpieces) it's still a must to have. Don't tell anyone, but Guster has replaced the spot for me that once only Dave Matthews could fill. So, take this advice and buy this cd (or tape if you must, maybe both!), try to be the first of your friends to have it! Guster is something the whole family will enjoy so go ahead, spend the meager bit o' dough and enrich your life today w/ Guster :)."
4,A Good Place to Start,"If you are a new fan of Guster, this album is the way to go. They are a great band with fun songs and while I like almost all of their albums, this one is still my favorite."
4,Not their best but very good,"This album just doesn't seem to have the great rhythms that the other two do. The only reason for giving four stars are that my favorite two Guster songs are on this CD. They are, Cocoon and Happy Frappe. These are are great songs."
3,"Not their best, but it's GUSTER!","Great album, just not my favorite by this band. I much prefer ""Lost and Gone Forever."" If you don't own any Guster, buy that one first. You'll still want to come back and buy this one."
2,Not their best work,"This cd is decent, but their newest cds are the best. I would not recommend buying this cd; however, I do recommend Guster's latest works."
1,Awful,"I bought this book because I love Rosemary Edghill's writing. This early book of hers is not worth reading, no matter how much you like the author. It is a Regency romance, a genre I normally enjoy. However, this romance included every cliche and plot twist of the Regency Romance genre. It is as though the author thought she would only get one book in her lifetime published, and decided to put in every plot she could think of into it. Don't buy it, even for curiousity's sake: It is truly that bad."
1,Broke apart after a few days,"Horrible mountBroke apart just like the OEM one after a week, but the OEM one lasted 16 years before busting apart LOLAmazon will not let me return and I have no idea how to get a replacement from beck arnley - i would recommend going to an auto parts store and paying the extra few bucks for this reason."
3,So-So Information for Event Planning,"My fiance and I purchased this book as we are planning a medieval wedding. The title and description of this book implied that we would find lots of valuable information on that topic. Well, we found lots of valuable information for feast planning, or putting on a re-enactment (a la Society for Creative Anachronism), and very little concerning period wedding traditions. The most interesting parts were the recipes/redactions and the instructions for medieval dance steps. There are also several pages that contain sheet music for period songs. If you are looking to put on a reenactment or feast, this is the book for you. If you are looking for anything else, I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,Very Cheap Looking,"I bought this dinosaur because my son really wanted a Carnotaurus after watching Dinosaur King. Unfortunately, it is very small, just a couple inches tall in the middle, and frankly looks pretty goofy. It looks like the quality of something you could purchase at the dollar store. It doesn't compare to the dinosaurs from Schleich and it is one of the least played with dinosaurs in my son's collection."
3,Smaller than other similar items.,"I was kind of disappointed with this one. I've ordered several other similar dinos from the same manufacturer, but apparently, there are a couple of different series. This one was not as high quality as some of the others I've purchased and is actually smaller in size, so, it doesn't ""fit"" as well with the others. Overall, though, its a Carnotaurus, so, my son loves it."
1,Complaint,I wish you'd have a list of the songs in the CD so I could decide whether I want to buy it or not.
3,extremely liberally biased view of politics,"I used this book for PoliSci 101 and although I found it easy to read, I was bothered throughout by the assumptions that every person shares Grigsby's liberal political views on abortion, homosexual issues, etc. I felt as if this book was trying to convert all students into democrats, as if it were THE WAY. The message throughout was, democrat=good, republican=bad. The text even misconstrued the Republican party roots by calling it quote, classical liberalism, unquote. I would rather a textbook to be more unbiased and present information without a liberal agenda attached. However, this may be why it appeals to university professors in the first place."
1,Strathwood Forged Stainless Steel 4-Piece BBQ Tool Set,Impressive stainless steel barbeque tools. Forged from 1 piece of steel. Everything I was looking for. Until I used them and washed them and watched them rust...poor grade of stainless. Dont store them in your grill cabinet. If it gets humid (even with the grill cover on) you WILL have rust.
2,Good quality for actually too large for me,This appears to be a good quality set - but for me the tools are actually too large. Hard to store and even harder to use. I should just have bought a regular set at Lowe's or Home Depot.
4,So glad it's still in print,Wonderful book! My only complaint is how uninteresting the cover is. I love how the print is per the original publication.
5,Detail and Insight from Borges,'El informe de Brodie' is full of criminal encounters with great characterization making the crimes and events believable. Borges gives insight into the minds of criminals like no other.Gritty details pour out as events unravel into stories that present crime with vivid criminal moments. Violence grabs the imagination as the pages are read.Borges exposes elegantly and is great to read.
3,cute- but not usually very funny,"The Mr. Potato Head comic is cute...it's sometimes funny, but when it is, it's more cute funny than anything else. I'm in the middle of this book now, and I was hoping for more. Some fans might love it, and I wanted to love it myself, but I don't. I just like it overall...and some of the strips are just completely unfunny. There are too many Dear Mrs. P comics- and none of these are very funny to me...the best ones are where Mr. Potato Head himself is the star of the 3 windowed story. Some of the jokes fall totally flat, and that was surprising to me, seeing as how it's a strip from Davis...and another guy I've never heard of before.I wouldn't recommend buying this book, unless you happen to be in love with potato head...I'd get it at the library and enjoy what you will of it that way. It's not bad, but it's not great."
4,Kanazawa Karate,"Very good DVD, helped me remember Shotokan forms I learned many years ago. Also in practically new condition, no damage or blemishes. Very satisfied with price & condition."
1,Falsely advertised,I have trained under Kanazawa and was excited to see that he had made a dvd containing all the Shotokan kata only to find that 6 out of the 26 kata were demonstrated in it. The cover and Amazon advertisement clearly state that all kata (and it names a few) are contained in the dvd but they're not even mentioned. This is clearly false advertising for this item. Please DON'T purchase it. It's useless.
1,Kanazawa Mastering Karate-Kyu Kata,I enjoyed watching this dvd.It explained only the application for the complex and intricate techniques that wasn't straight-forward without boring the audience with the more basic application.I am looking forward to seeing others in the series - Dan Kata and Kumite.It contained very interesting and useful information.
5,Great blu-ray at this price,Cannot go wrong at this price. Great movies now on blu-ray. I am yet to watch Twister in this set. Have seen the movie too many times.
3,Twister/Poseidon/The Perfect Storm Blue-ray DVD,"I have only watched Twister so far. We were a bit disappointed in the reproduction of this classic as some seems become blotchy, pixelated, and lacked vividness in color. Other parts looked very good. In fairness we have not watched the other two movies as of yet."
3,was expecting more,looks like a counterfeit Chinese blu ray operation. case and dvds look cheesy and cheap but the quality is all i care about and they are definitely blu ray!
3,Getting what you pay for,"I saw one at a local Harborfreight and thought, it's $2.79 eh I'll tri it out. Well it's not worth more than $3-$5 I'll put it that way. The tip they provide it not the best, it wants to blow out way too easy unless it's turned on about all the way. The aluminum body won't expand enough to allow a standard canister to fill it with a lot of fluid/pressure. If you turn it down low it will do as it says and last about 15 minutes, but on a low setting it wants to go out way too easy. The thing I do like is that it does put out a vary long and hot flame, witch is nice for large wires and small copper pipe. Another thing it's bigger than it looks, it "" round and ""7-/34 which is a little long considering the thin easily bendable tip.For $4 dollars give or take it's not bad."
2,Dangerous and cheap!!!,"when i first filled it up with butane it worked fine but it uses up the fuel extremely fast. it would probably last 5 minutes, if that when its full. once it ran out i went to refill it a second time and it filled up great no problems but then i went to light it and all the butane exploded out of the top and i have been unable to fill it since. now it just leeks out and i am scared to light it again. i would not buy this unless you are not a big fan of your eye brows."
3,not enough info,I would like to know how many tiles are in the package for $31? no where in the description does it state how many square feet you get if ordering.
1,My skin had a bad reaction to this mask.,"I must have super-sensitive skin. I kept the mask on for 20 minutes as per the instructions and when I took it off, found that my face was bright red and it burned. It looked like I spent an hour out in the direct sunlight. So much for ""Gently removes facial impurities"" and ""Soothes minor skin irritations."" If it was possible to give this mask zero stars, I would have. The only positive thing I could say about it is that this product arrived rather quickly."
5,Have to love Thanks To Gravity,"I was introduced to Thanks To Gravity through a friend and within a very short time they became my favorite band. Being a highly critical musician myself, who has heard almost everything recorded, I reserve my number one spot for this band. Everyone that I have shared their music with absolutely loves them."
2,cute tush!,"Although the doll is quite inspiring, and he does have a nice butt which would rival Ken's, the fun factor is a bit uneven. I just worry about the lead content in the paint. Interesting collectible in any event."
1,Big mistake,"I got this for my son, and now he thinks christianity is just another ploy for selling garbage. Like transformers or star wars. ""Why does Jesus care about making money?"" he asked. I had no good answer. Now he has stopped attending church. Plus the arms dangle loosely. Poorly made."
4,"Excelente, increible produccion!","El estilo musical de los Secretos es country/pop. Este concierto les acompaña una seccion de cuerdas y estos cantan sus mejores exitos. Junto con el tributo a Enrique Urquijo estos dos cds los considero muy buenos. Claro escuchar a Enrique cantar ""Ojos de Gata""y a Antonio Vega interpretar ""Agarrate fuerte a mi Maria"" es dificil de superar, en parte porque ambos vivian la letra ambos teniendo problema con sustancias controladas. La musica es colaboracion de Alvaro y Enrique con exepciones como ""Ojos de Gata"" y ""El Boulevard de los Sueños Rotos"" donde colabora Sabina. Muy bueno, excelente sonido y puede ver el concierto en UTube."
4,Important for anyone practicing or consuming Psychology,"I use this book as part of my ""Politics of Psychology"" course at Antioch University Los Angeles. Cushman provides a wonderfully idiosyncratic reading of the development of the discipline and practice of Psychology in the United States. Using a social constructionist lens he presents a strong argument intent on demonstrating the various ways in which economic, political and cultural concerns gave shape to the contemporary practice of psychology. Cushman's work is puncuated with interesting stories told in his warm and enriching style, but it also provides careful argument and analysis along the way."
3,One of a kind cd,I own this and the Ferguson's arrangement of Earth & All Stars is great.My choir starts each year with Johnson's Earth & All Stars and now the Ferguson arrangement is published by GIA. The traditional Beautiful Savior is in one word beautiful.
1,Biomedical,"This book should not be considered for an introductory course to mechanics, ever. The text contains very few examples and the problems following each chapter are no easy task, even with 4 hours of lecture a week. The introduction of index noatation and tensors seemed to assume that the reader had some prior knowledge. Also, not all derivations of formulas are given, some are just thrown at your face with little explanation of how they came about."
2,"Forced, not natural","This piece is of course so overplayed and over-recorded, but if, like me, you still really like it, that makes us hypercritical of all the versions. This one seems to follow the tradition of Gil Shahan's among others, using modern instruments and a novel approach to flash the piece up. But where Shahan's was revelatory and fresh, this is just too heavy-handed, the emphasis and dynamics overdone, the rubato expecially seems forced and overly romantic, nothing seems natural. I do like the break-neck speed in some movements. But it doesn't sound intimate enough."
5,"Anne-Sophie""s ""the Four Seasons","this is absolutely Anne-Sophie Mutter at her best. I never thought she could best her Four Seasons performance with karajan. This performance is not as stoic as she was then. You can sense her youth and liveliness and thus I closed my eyes and felt all the beauty of the Four Seasons, as they should be heard."
5,Breathtaking,"I have many recordings of the Four Seasons, my favorite being two by the I Musici, both different seasons from different years, wonderful renditions. My memory of the best live performance was of Andor Toth in Colorado, as a kid. I even have a thrilling effort by a Japanese Koto Ensemble and saw one arrangement for harps, in the record store. I have long been impressed by Ms. Sophie-Mutter's Mozart but heard her do the Berg on TV. I went out and immediately bought the Vivaldi, it being the only one of her records in the store. I heard a recording or the Philadelphia, owned by a colleague, on the way to a gig once. It featured Ansel Brusilov, as soloist. Up to now for technical wizardry and musicality, that's the one I had been searching for. Alas, non-existent. This one with Annie Sophie-Mutter, however, gave me goosebumps. Such technique, such music, such feeling . . .!"
4,A fantastic performance dulled by poor recording.,"This is a fantastic performance from all the musicians. TheVivaldi is full of life and suffused with warmth and passion. Sophieattacks the music beautifully, allowing the listener to surrender to the beauty of the music. However, there is a really annoying underlying deep rumble throughout the recording which makes it sound as though there is a tube train running underneath the concert hall all the time - or that the CD is playing on a cheap vinyl turntable. A shame, because this performance is definitive, a one off. END"
2,Not her thing.,"Anne-Sophie Mutter is a marvelous artist, but not one born for the Baroque repertoire. This recording sounds too beefy for Vivaldi, textures are thick and the overall view is too romantic. Surprisingly, Mutter virtually ignores what is going on in Baroque music these days. For the best 4 Seasons in the catalogue the choice is obviously Fabio Biondi and L' Europa Galante on the OPUS111 label. For the Tartini Devil Sonata go for Andrew Manze's superlative performance in Harmonia Mundi."
2,Old fashioned and rather boring,"At this point it's useless to argue about the benefits of period performance practice. Gut strings just sound better than steel ones in Baroque Music. Mutter has nothing to say about Vivaldi. I found this recording hopelessly predictable. Go for Biondi in OPUS111 or Il Gardino Armonico in TELDEC. They may not have as nice legs as Signora Mutter, but they certainly understand Il Prete Rosso a lot better."
2,Looking sexy but sounding less so...,"And I don't mean that in a good way. While I give credit to ASM for her obvious intelligence and her commitment to artistic exploration (you can always tell that she's thought every note through), I also think that her artistic aspirations can backfire, as they seem to do in this CD. She obviously wants her Vivaldi to sound ""fresh,"" ""modern,"" ""romantic,"" ""hip."" What her recording of the Vivaldi ends up being, however, is an interpretation that screams, above the music itself, ""Hey, this ain't your mama's Vivaldi!"" Her need to push boundaries exhausts me after a while.There are certainly some glorious moments, but again, they're overshadowed by a lack of subtlety and also by an ensemble that seems to be better suited driving a Mack truck than playing Vivaldi. You can hear them coming from miles away.And all that self-congratulatory stuffing between the CD covers...what's up with that?"
5,Lively and lustful,"The romantic purists that don't like this recording give the impression that Sophie steals all of the original intentions that Vivaldi had when he wrote this music. I firmly believe that nothing could be further from the truth. Her liberal dashing of ""musical hot sauce"" throughout the piece truly breathes new life into what most people consider a worn out ol' faithful. As others have said in this forum, this recording takes background music, and makes it a masterpiece to listen to, not just hear.Of the several recordings that I have of this piece, this is the one that I choose to play most often; not just because I love The Four Seasons, but because I really enjoy this rendition."
4,Deutsche Grammophon adopts MTV culture,"Someone in DG has done a terrific job. This album will sell millions, and the quality of the music is not an issue at all. Anne Sophie Mutter has taken the same path as Pavarotti and Bocelli, and crossed the lines into pop culture. I don't think this is too bad, but if you are reading CD reviews, then you're probably a serious listener, and want to get a decent performance.Mutter's 4 seasons is good, some movements even excellent, but let's face it: nobody plays Italian baroque like that anymore. This CD wouldn't have been published if it hadn't been for Mutter's great looks.However, as Mr. Gammelgaard mentioned in his review, there is one performance which dwarfs all the rest: Il Giardino Armonico (Teldec) - An amazing, authentic baroque performance. It's a part of a magnificent set of concerti by Vivaldi. You won't regret spending a two-full-price amount on it.Don't fall for cheap pop design!"
2,Fraulein Mutter Ist Heis!,"No doubt the sexy young fraulein is hot. She is an excellent soloist, and it goes without saying the DG marketing machinery is cashing in on her captivating physical appearance. I listened to this CD however and said no. The primary reason for my rejection is the sound engineering--it's overdone. I'm not one to insist on authenticity, but with the technology now at their disposal, sound engineers can go to far. This is supposed to be baroque music!"
1,Californian,"Did I miss something? The best thing about this CD is the photograph on the cover. I've heard worse versions of The Four Seasons but only on budget labels.There are some good moments but overall the band sounds like it needs a lot more practice. Ms Mutter plays Vivaldi and Vivaldi loses. You can almost hear the Trondheimers struggling, and not always managing, to keep pace. At times, the production is reduced to a mush of sound. This recording probably sounds a lot better on the radio or a cheap CD player than on a decent sound system. Perhaps that's what the production team was aiming for. Vivaldi for commuters."
1,"Please, give us a break!",I think it's insanity to record the music of Vivaldi today in this manner. Isn't it clear that period instruments are superior in every aspect when it comes to performing baroque music. The reason that Mutter even is aloud to record it is because the record company knows that she will sell many records however she plays the music. I don't think any other company would aloud a less famous star to record this music today. Check out Il Giardino Armonico's recording instead and discover the music when it's performed without any pathetic fragments of romantic 20th century playing. The one star value is maybe because of the nice layout of the record. Something to put on your wall when you have realized that Mutter and her friends are not really up to it!
2,Too brilliant,"I bought this recording because Anne-Sophie Mutter's Autumn on her Meditation CD is so lovely -- but that version, as it turns out, was conducted by Von Karajan. The playing on this version is brilliant, but it's just too brilliant for me: the attack is so loud and aggressive that I couldn't settle down and enjoy the music nor even listen to the whole thing. The big lesson for me is to buy versions of her recordings in which she herself is not the conductor. I plan to donate this one to the local library and get the complete Von Karajan version. But in no way is this bad playing. It's just a matter of taste. If you like loud, flashy music, you will love this recording."
4,Great Author!,"Again I will say ALL books by this author are worth getting! Just got this for my 2 year old son for X-mas and he loves it! It's main content is numbers 1-10 and describing words (jumping, green, skinny...). It's great! Check out these too...Snowballs, Vegetable Soup, Nuts to You, Ten Black Dots, Planting a Rainbow."
3,"Colorful, but no classic","This is a very colorful book. There are some design flaws, some text is difficult to read and the text is more suitable for a 1-2 year old, the illustrations are well done and my 2yr. old son is entertained."
5,Great for preschool!,We enjoy this book in preschool as a counting book and also as a wonderful link to drawing our own colorful fish. The children will use this book many times after the initial reading.
4,John Lennon In My Life is a riot,I very highly recommend this book to any Lennon/Beatles fan with a good sense of humour and an open mind. I Loved Every Page Of It. You wont be able to keep a straight face while you read it. What A Clown!
5,"A recommended addition to personal, professional, academic, and community library 20th Century Photography collections","Sinners & Saints is a compendium of homeo-erotic images in which photographer Anthony Gayton pays homage to the iconography of the male in the tradition of pictorialist photography. From romanticized mythic imagery, to Victorian style nudes, to stylized contemporary pin-ups, the visual theme of eternal masculine beauty and desire is provided from beginning to end without textual interruption. Enhanced with a bi-lingual essay on ""Youth, Beauty And Desire: The Photographic Work of Anthony Gayton"" by Peter Weiermair, Sinners & Saints is an impressive body of work and a recommended addition to personal, professional, academic, and community library 20th Century Photography collections."
5,The Court Martial of Daniel Boone,I was surprised that this was a first edition signed book! what a find! I am always intrigued by Mr Eckert's work!
3,Good novel but not one of his best,"Although this is based on a true story, much of the story of Daniel Boone's courtmartial told in this book is fiction. The history of the events surrounding Boone's courtmartial is very interesting and is surely worth telling. Although the author is very talented in writing historical fiction, this was not one of his best. Maybe it was the courtroom drama re-enactment that was not that interesting to me. In my opinion, the author's other works such as The Frontiersmen, Wilderness Empire, and The Conquerors were much better. Regardless, this is still a good read, especially if you are a fan of the history of the early American frontier."
5,definitely a money saver!,"for us, the draft that this kit stopped really decreased the amount of heat needed to warm the house. i suggest not using the hair dryer to shrink it and just reuse it next year with new tape; although the tape is expensive. overall, the product works. the permanent fix is to get better windows and don't be penny wise pound foolish."
4,Keeps the cold out... if you do it right.,"So I am admittedly not the most savvy with things that are related to taping a window shut with plastic but this wasn't too hard. Any errors, aka, wind that pushes the sheets out and squeaking plastic has to do with my own inability to attach the plastic to the window properly. Definitely read the directions!"
5,3M window film,"Don't bother with ""off"" brands, you'll just be wasting your money.... They go on easy, are very clear and help save $$$."
1,Disappointed,"I bought the 3M brand because it was supposed to have a stronger adhesive than the Frost King brand I used last year. Unfortunately, after about 6 weeks, the plastic on *every* window is pulling away from the adhesive. Much worse than the product I used last year.I've seen some people say the lack of adhesion is due to not cleaning the surface properly, however, this doesn't account for the fact that the plastic is pulling away from the *tape*, which is still stuck to the window still."
4,Draft be gone!,Our house had newer double pane windows when we purchased the house but the previous owner went cheap on the windows and when the wind blows in the winter you can literally feel it. Can't afford to replace the windows right now so opted for this 3M kit. Bottom line it works and our room is no longer drafty and it is also stays warm longer.
5,Great Product,"Super easy to install, works well, keeps out drafts, good price. Enough tape and plastic for the stated amount of windows. Recommended!"
4,Not too hard,"Seems to work fine. The windows I did cover are large, so I didn't expect to get five windows done. But I got three tall ones done and the entry to our attic, so I'm happy with the amount included. I had two rolls of double sided tape, which was more than enough, so happy with that as well.Not too hard to apply. I was afraid I'd need three hands! But the material has just enough weight to it that it was fairly easy to attach to the tape. Shrank up nice and snug with the hair dryer.I've only had the windows covered for about 24 hours now, but the air coming off of them is no longer cold, like the other windows in the house. I think it's helping. Time will tell."
2,Don't buy if you have older windows with inward protruding window sills,"If your indoor window frame isn't completely flat, it will fall off after a short amount of time. This is a great concept, but you need a completely flat surface, with no inward protruding window sill, to make this work properly. Might have better luck with the outdoor version."
2,misleading,"size is only 210 inch not 252 inch as advertised 17.5 ft x 12inches per ft. = 210inch not 252 inch 5.16 x 12 = 61.92 not 62 inches but that is close enough. the 210 not the 252 inches sucks....the 42 inches by 62 inches is a big piece not received (enough to do another window or two). The size was the main reason for this purchases I would not buy again, I would send back but not worth the trouble for 16 bucks. will go back to frost king."
3,effective,"I question the effectiveness of this item but if it is worth it, relative to cost savings, then I recommend this item. Installation is somewhat time consuming if you have a lot of windows but if you are good with your hands or if you are smart then this is easy to install.Please note that the tape sometimes pulls off the paint on your windows when you remove it at the end of the season."
3,Good product but overpriced,"I have been using Frost King to plastic my windows for over 10 years. Based on reviews, I decided to try 3M. The 3M product works just as well as Frost King, but is overpriced. The 3M tape is much easier to use (I wish they should that in rolls alone so I could that with the Frost King pre-cut window-sized plastic), but the plastic is the same quality.My biggest problem is that it advertises enough plastic for 5 windows. This is a lie. I got 4.5 windows from this, and 2 are smaller the average sized windows. I have NEVER had this issue from Frost King. Also, I got 2 rolls of tape, so some of the tape had to be thrown away--what a waste! Frost King gives you extra tape and plastic in case you need it.Overall good product but way too expensive for only 4 windows. I'm going back to Frost King and save some money. I have never had a problem using it over many many years."
1,No Way,"Very disappointing. May be good in some situations, but we cannot get the tape to stick to latex paint surfaces. Surfaces were meticulously cleaned. The tape peeled right off."
5,Terrific Product,We've used the 3-M window insulator kits for several years and have found them to be superior to other brands and substantially reduce our heating costs throughout the winter months. Even though we have double paned windows we would still get cold drafts before we started using the insulating window kits. We've tried other brands but found the film to be much thinner and annoying to install as the film would tear very easily. You may pay a little more for this brand but in our opinion it's worth every penny. It's simple to install and the tape that is included is the best there is. It holds extremely well and removes easily without damaging woodwork. Now I watch for sale prices through the warmer months of the year and stock up so I'm always prepared. In my opinion this product absolutely deserves more than 5 stars!
1,3M window insulator kit,"3M 2141W Indoor 5-Window Insulator KitI bought two of these kits..I was so excited about how good it looked on the windows. The house was considerably warmer. This lasted almost a month. Then the plastic started falling off the double sided tape. The tape stuck to the window frame very well, but the plastic pulled away from the tape. I won't be buying any more."
1,Don't bother !,"We just bought this stuff to help insulate our windows. Maybe there is some magical trick we don't know but it would not shrink at all. We just short of put a hot iron to the plastic and NOTHING happened. A total waste of time, do not bother."
1,Didn't make my child's playroom any warmer,"I bought this item to try and make my son's playroom a little warmer. I live in VA so the winter's don't get too cold, a typical day is in the 30's but we have lots of windows that let the cold air come in. Our house is only two years old so the windows should be good, obviously that's not the case. I was hoping that the insulator kit would raise the room temp a couple degrees and it did no such thing. The room is as cold as it was before. The installation is easy, but in my opinion, just doesn't do the job."
1,What a pile of junk!,This garbage isn't worth a dime. The tape used to secure the file barely sticks to anything and pulls off with almost no effort. The file tears no matter how careful you are with it. I had to put it up twice just to get to the point where the blow drying of the wrinkles caused the film to shrink just enough to pull large chuck of tape off the window sill.This stuff is garbage. It isn't worth the money or the frustration that is involved in getting it attached. You might as well take the money you would pay for this and burn it to keep warm as it is just as affective.I will never buy this again.
2,Faulty tape,"While the portions of the product we received that weren't faulty and do the job of insulation where installed, unfortunately half the product was essentially wasted because one of the two rolls of tape received was bad and had no adhesion. Surprising from such a well known name like 3M."
4,"Works well, careful in direct sunlight","I purchased this to use on my parent's large and drafty house during the winter. The plastic goes on well, the tape is easy to place and doesn't fall off. We made sure to wipe down the window sills prior to applying the tape, and had two people to place the insulation up in order to ensure a good tight and even fit.One thing to note though, is that during particularly sunny days, there is a distinct warmed-plastic smell that unnerves my mother, as she believes it's bad for our health. I'm somewhat inclined to agree.However, my parents noticed a slight decrease in their heating bill, so they've kept the insulation up. It's actually been over a year and the insulation is still there."
1,waste of money,"The 3M tape is constantly becoming unglued to the window sill, making the entire product useless. Seriously, do yourself a favor and just buy the cheap stuff at Lowes. I won't make the mistake of buying this product again."
5,Used it for years,"I've used this stuff since the day it was introduced, in two different houses, on junk windows and low-E, double-pane windows. It always brings an improvement in the feeling of how cold a room is. I've been doing it so long, I'm quick with the installation, and have my own little routine for getting it done almost perfectly every time. My spouse follows me with the hair dryer and handles the shrink part of the work. Doing a dozen-plus windows every season."
5,3M Window Insulator Kit,We've used 3M window insulator kits since the product has come out. The tape is superior to all other similar products! We wouldn't use any other brand!
5,save money and stop drafts,this is a great product. i have old windows and this is a cheap and simple solution to lowering heating costs. dont miss out on this great invention.
3,Works great,"I put this over a window which has a little opening on top doesnt close fully.. fairly easy to put on,,i missed some spots and put an extra layer of plastic over , blow dryed and everything is sealed in. I was worried my cat might rip the plastic since he loves looking out the window, so far he hasnt touched it, that how good the blow dryers seals it into the window, fingers crosses that he doesnt one day :).. My room feels much warmer, I live an apartment and its working great!"
2,Not all that easy,"Idea is good but not as easy to install as it claims. Peeling paper off tape is difficult, job takes a lot longer with a lot more effort and patience than instructions would indicate."
3,five 3.5 windows? not for me,"I'm disappointed with the product description because it states that it covers five 3x5 windows. My windows are 3x5.5 so I knew that I wasn't going to get all the windows covered that I wanted. Unfortunately, I was only able to cover 3 windows, because of how the sheet of plastic is cut. The directions inform you to cut to width so you only have to measure the 3 ft out and cut because the length is already determined at 5 ft. This being the case, I had to roll the sheet out and cut it every 5.5 ft instead so I only got 3 sheets (with lots of leftover width) out of the package. It would have MUCH nicer if the width was predetermined and I only had to cut to length.On the other hand, this product was very easy to install, and it turns out crystal clear once I put the hair dryer to it. I can't tell how well it is going to help out my heating bill yet, but I still need to pick up another pack to finish off the other windows anyways."
2,Expensive,Maybe it's my fault but the idea of buying a giant piece of plastic and two rolls of tape for 25 bucks just seems ridiculous. It works okay but my windows still have chills coming through from the winter air. I don't think they work that well and what this kit actually costs in comparison to what I paid makes me a bit upset. :p
4,Only covered four windows.,"There definitely is not enough here to cover five windows. Oh well. Other than that the product works exactly as intended. I have not had tape issues, as some reviewers have."
2,Only as good as the weekest link.,"The tape does not stick all that well. I am a very meticulous in the process and it takes me about an hour per window. The use of a heat gun rather than a blow dryer seems to work well. Re-enforce the corners (two small pieces 90 degrees to the actual corner you are making and one 45 degrees... basically a W with small pieces in each corner before setting down the long strips) or it will peel up within a week or so it may do so just to spite you anyways. Lousy tape from a company that specializes in adhesives, get it together 3M !"
5,delivers the goods,great product was very easy to use but i did run out of tape it did 4 big windows 40x 50
5,Don't be cheap,"The stuff at bigboxmart does not work. This does. Outside of replacing those drafty windows, then do the job the best you can. Order some of these kits and keep the wind out."
5,Great product,This product was easy to install and has made a huge difference in the temperatures of the rooms. Stay with the name brand. It is worth the little extra money. You will make up that money in saved energy costs.
1,Bad Product,"Received item fast as always from Amazon. But product was junk. Usually I swear by 3-M but this one the tape was not sticky and would not hold. The film had been folded so long that some parts of it tore when unfolding it. Maybe I just got ahold of an old package that had been sitting around awile, but out of total frustration with the film tearing and the tape not holding tossed this whole thing in the trash."
3,Product change?,I buy the 3M window film every year because it is SO CLEAR and I refuse to buy the cloudy plastic provided by the other brands. I am a bit disappointed in the product this year. It does not seem as clear as it has in the past and the packaging is changed. I am concerned that they may have changed the product.
4,good but be sure of the measurements,at first instance look like a cheap plastic but when you installed is really strong. be sure to have the correct measurements because depends of the side you cut the plastic you can loss a lot of material. I mean if you open the wrap from top to botton or if you used left to right. I can feel the cold air but is not that strong like before. to make it better I cover the window twice. you don't need it but I wanted to be really sure.
3,It does help,"Granted, I don't think I did a very good job putting this insulation up. But I actually found it slightly difficult to get it right. I can't fault them too much for my own incompetence, though.I do believe it made a difference. My windows are so thin it basically feels like they're open in the winter time, so obviously a thin sheet of plastic insulation won't completely block out the cold air. But I do think it did its part to help keep my room noticeably toastier than the previous winter. It's inexpensive, so I think it's worth trying and I will be putting it up again next year."
3,Didn't work for me,"I thought this product would make a substantial difference after applying to the windows in my bedroom. I didn't notice any difference before and after, it might have helped a bit. I would really recommend you to double check the size of your windows before buying this because it will be tricky to cut it in order to make it fir your windows. You can barely see that there is a plastic film on your windows so it doesn't disturb if you have a view. Blowdrying the whole thing is a pain, in the end (if you do it right) however you might notice a difference."
5,Amazing Difference!,"I ordered this product, not only because it is made in America, but because we really needed to do something about the heat loss from the old windows in our home. What a difference it has made already! We have reduced our oil usage significantly, and have noticed that each room feels warmer, rather than drafty. Easy to install too!"
2,removal problematic,"I've just finished trying to remove my 3M window seal. Prior to today I was very happy with this product, it really helped with drafts. Following today however, I doubt I will ever use it again. As I tried to remove the tape from the window sills I discovered that two outcomes were most likely: 1) the tape pulled away from the adhesive leaving a sticky and dust attracting goo behind (that has been really had to get off) or, 2) it peeled away the paint. A disappointing ending to what had been a great use of this product."
3,It serves it's purpose.,It serves it purpose but the 5 window package only covered 3 of our windows so we bought more. It is working out okay.
4,Window Insolation Results,"I purchased 2 kits of the 3M 2142W, window insloator kits. I got the insulator put up just before the extreme cold we have had here in Florida. I was absolutely amazed at the difference the insulator made in the interior temperatures in my home. I would recommed this product to anyone that does not have double pane windows."
5,"Excellent, highly recommend!","I have used an ""off"" brand of window film in the past. I should have trusted 3M to start with. The adhesive is excellent, goes on well. My only concern is if the adhesive will come off next Spring.The other brand I purchased at Home Depot didn't work as well, the adhesive didn't stick to the film very well, then in Spring, I couldn't get the adhesive off.Both keep my house much warmer (when the adhesive sticks).I highly recommend this."
1,DO NOT BUY. Tape doesn't stick to painted surfaces.,"I just tried applying the tape and it would not stick to any of the available surfaces. When I think 3M I usually think quality, but not anymore. Severely disappointed in this product. The surface I was applying to has been painted with off the shelf paint, nothing special. This tape would not stick no matter what I tried. Cleaned the surface, heated the tape up a little with a hair dryer, scuffed the surface with sandpaper. Sorry 3M, bad product."
4,I think I feel warmer....,"Don't unfold the plastic covering. Other than that it seemed fairly simple to install. Could not see any difference when applied heat. It is fairly clear and my fear that it would be unsightly was unfounded. In our 70 year old home anything helps, but this did not turn our old, single pane, no storm window windows into anything more than windows with a sheet of plastic over them. The breezes have stopped (especially around the air conditioner). The price makes it worth the effort. Give it a try, if all fails move south .... far south."
5,Vixen,Love Vixen....waiting for them to have a dvd collection of all their videos. A lot of other bands are doing that why not Vixen?
3,CORAZON/MY LOVE,"Bought the CD to enjoy one of the songs and thought the rest of the album would be just as good; however, I was disappointed, which makes me want to go back to ordering singles....."
4,A nice collection of different styles,"This is one of Dan's better solo efforts. It combines various musical styles including folk, country, and regae. My favorite songs include Driftin', Sailing, Blue Skies Blue Eyes. A very good effort."
4,Island folk - I like it!,"I like this better than Bodden Town (and I liked Bodden Town). This album blends various styles and influences like folk, country, and island music. The best songs are Driftin', Sailing, Blue Skies Blue Eyes. A very good effort, his best solo album since Cross Over."
4,Island folk!,"I like this better than Bodden Town (and I liked Bodden Town). This album blends various styles and influences like folk, country, and island music. The best songs are Driftin', Sailing, Blue Skies Blue Eyes. A very good effort, his best solo album since Cross Over."
4,Remember when music like this was on the radio?,"There are very few places that you can find music like this anymore. Quite a bargain, too. Highlight are Comfort by Athenaeum, and AFH by Slackjaw. Counting Crows fans pay attention... this is an album for you...."
5,"Works great, exceptional value",These filters are an excellent value. They work fine for everyday use and the average user would not be able to distinguish their optical quality from those costing much more.
3,Sent Wrong Item...,A similar item was substituted without notifying me. I had to call to complain and get a refund amount for the difference. Substituted item was OK and vendor refunded me the difference.
5,Stunningly beautiful music,"I would describe this music as a mellow and unusal mix of music where Enya meets Maria Callas, and I am a fan of both, so that's a good thing. It is so good that Billboard Music called it the best classical crossover of the year!I would call this music techno opera scene from the future with beautiful opera singing, just to give you an idea of what this music is like! Also, the singer from the Fifth Element soundtrack, Inva Mula sings the song ""Mon Amour"".Also singing on this cd is a singer named Shakila. She sings on ""Kokab"" and ""Khodoya"". These three are my favorite tracks. Though the cd in whole is a joy to listen to.We'll say that ""Operatica-Shine"" succesfully bridged the Middle East to Europe via southern Spain.So if you're a nu music dj, pick up this cd, so you can really spin an eclectc mix of music - Savannah Skye aka DJ Dakini-NYC..."
3,Oh dear...they've taken their eye off the ball,"This is not much like their first album (which was a mostly clever, sometimes ham-handed combination of operatic arias and modern electronic instrumentation).But Shine is pretty much the same ethno-electronica that was pervasive throughout the 90s. Think Deep Forest, Anubian Nights, Enigma, B-Tribe, and even Sting's ""Desert Rose"". Yawnnnnnnnnnnnn.Their first album was good mostly because of its orginality (operatic arias are definitely a challenge), but any old fool can slap a ""cool"" Middle Eastern chant over a modern beat.What bugs me about both albums is that they don't maintain that singularly operatic quality--it seems to be a sonic delicacy reserved only for a few tracks.So, with a very few exceptions, this album is a bit contrived."
3,I was misled,"I was misled by the title into thinking that this would be more operatic than it actually is, however this is not a criticism, in fact it's a bonus. 'An unusual mix of tracks that are a light and soothing mix of dance, futuristic electronic beats and opera.The songs are quite different so it does take a little getting into, but there is lots of depth and quality. A number of better known artists/tracks are featured including Inva Mula, who appeared in the opera scene in the Sci-fi movie ""The Fifth Element"".This could be a love or hate type album, but if you like music with feeling and originality, then give it a go."
4,It's Your Money - You Earned It!,"Look at your paycheck...not the take-home pay line, but the gross pay line. It's a lot more isn't it? Wouldn't you like to take home your WHOLE check? Well that's where the Fair Tax starts.The Fair Tax is not a flat tax rate...The Fair Tax starts with abolishing the IRS and replacing all taxes with a progressive version of a national sales tax.

4,Dance for the Dead,"A no-nonsense, no-frills, and fast-paced read. Jane Whitefield is a native American Houdini on a life mission to save others. Her escapes from danger are clever and provide the reader (or listener) a sort of ""how to"" on avoiding detection, capture and/or death. This is not the usual who-dunnit or action thriller. The native American thread woven through it is fascinating and Jane is a remarkable and unique heroine. There isn't a dull moment. After listening to the audiobook version, I immediatelly went out and bought the first book featuring Jane: ""Vanishing Act."" It was equally compelling. If there was a negative about ""Dance for the Dead,"" it was the audiobook reader, Lindsay Crouse. Her monotone reading became, well, monotonous. But the author's story overcame her flat recitation."
3,Disappointing Ending,"This was the first ""Jane"" book I've read and while I enjoyed it and will read others, I was very disappointed in the ending - not to give it away (so stop reading here if you haven't read it) but how does Barraclough go from knowing EVERYTHING Jane does early on (the highway scene) to being stupid enough to be trapped in an abandoned warehouse with Jane? Not believeable for me, and disappointing."
3,Needs something.,"You know when someone is cooking something on the stove and they want you to taste it? You take some off the spoon and it tastes good,but it needs a little something to make it better. Maybe a dash of salt? or pepper? That's the way I feel about Thomas Perry's books. He writes interesting characters, I love Jane W.,and his plots are plausible and engaging, but there is just something missing that I can't quite put my finger on.I found the romance with Dr. McKinnon to be rushed and contrived. It's not unusual to develop romantic feelings for a long time friend but it is unusual to propose marriage to her right after making love for the first time. It would have read much more realisticly to let this relationship develop over two or more novels.Dance for the Dead, was my fourth or fifth Perry novel. So far, I haven't been blown away like many other reviewers have. Until Perry finds that dash of something, he'll always be a 3 star writer to me."
4,Dance for the Dead,As always Janes there to help you dissapear.Sometimes the process is kind of long but the storykeeps you on the edge of your seat.Dance for the Dead is no different.A GOOD READ
4,Saving Goodbye,"The second Jane Whitefield mystery novel depends to some extent on VANISHING ACT for backstory. DANCE FOR THE DEAD by Thomas Perry presents a fully established character who must meet desperate challenges to secure safety for her chosen person and another she picks up along the way. One man will stop at nothing to hide his activites and spare no expense until Jane is running for her life.It also opens an avenue for Jane to achieve a special relationship with a long time friend, Dr. Carey McKinnon. Some of the best dialogue in the entire novel occurs during the brief moments when Jane and Carey are together.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
4,What a great year!,"2001 was my favorite year of baseball in my 35 years of following the game. Barry Bonds' 73 homers, Luis Gonzalez getting over on Mariano Rivera to steal the World Series from the Yankees, and the debuts of Pujols and Ichiro made this unforgettable.The Sporting News does a fine job taking it all down for us."
5,super fast delivery,"I ordered this case and the very next morning i got it, super fast delivery very happy with the case it is all i asked for and more....thank you alot. oh you if your reading this and thinking of buying a nice case this is it my friend dont pass this up. you will be happy"
5,Works great!,"Works as designed with no problems. I have not experienced the issue with the inner circle teeth being torn as a previous reviewer mentioned. I too set the weight of the kingpin on the truck bed hitch at hookup but not so much as to lift the landing gear off the ground. I expect to see some wear and tear on this product but will be happy if it lasts one season, especially for the price. Anything is better than using grease! I would recommend this product."
5,Use this on a Jayco Pinnicle 31RLTS,"Works great and fits perfectly on my Jayco Pinnicle 31RLTS fifth wheeler. i put a tiny amount of vasaline the the insert, i was told that it will last longer that way."
5,Business 101 But Easy to Read,"This book should be required reading for every college graduate because the author tells the truth about what's important. Like, ""It's not the size of your office, it's the size of your paycheck."" It can prevent you from making mistakes, like ""Never sit down in the lobby while waiting for a client"" How does he know this stuff?"
1,The worst of it's genre,"Not even worth the 1-cent price shown above at the used shops. This book is the very worst of a plethora of cute career related drivel which has flooded bookshelves since the mid eighties. It reads exactly like what it is - a book basically written (probably in a single weekend) so its author, a professional ""consultant,"" could cash in on the endless supply of bosses who buy such tripe so they can leave it in the break room for real employees to read while waiting for their lunch to cook in the microwave. Full of obvious and pointless advice like ""Take courses at your community college."" or ""Never get drunk at your office holiday party."" this book is an insult to anyone who actually works for a living. I would give this turd less than one star if I could."
1,incomprehensible English,"While the *visual* demonstration of the various stances in this DVD is fairly clear, Kancho Hirokazu's broken English makes it nearly impossible to understand what he is saying or what the names of the techniques are. As instructional material, it is very poor, since one can't understand what he is saying. I have seen other karate DVDs where a fluent English voice explains what the particular sensei in those DVDs is saying (e.g. ""functional karate""). I don't recommend this DVD."
5,Cool,"I love this book, I read it and I couldn't stop myself. When I saw how big it was at first I thought it was a waste of time but actually it was really interesting. I liked how they were stranded on an island with tons of pearls. Very very creative! Buy this book, it is the best adventure story I have ever read! END"
4,Good Basic stretches with good instruction,"I picked this up the the other day so I could explore some other stretching options. I like the basic illustrations on the rear of each card that demonstrate how the stretch is to be done. The front of the card contains information on how to do the stretch, how many times you should do it and a tip that might be who the stretch is good for, or a referral to another helpful stretch. You can pick several cards for each stretching session.The pamphlet that comes inside describes the benefits of stretching, how you should approach stretching and some pre-defined stretching groups of cards for specific lifestyles, i.e: office workers, golfers, etc. . ."
4,Basics,"This book is great if you want some tips on basic stretches to do everyday. I was personally looking for a book to accommodate for dancers, but this book does have a lot of the basic stretches that some dancers forget about on a daily basis. If you want to improve your flexibility, then this book is a great starting point."
5,"An excellent, excellent product","The authors of this Stretch Deck really came up with 50 superb stretches, some of which I was unfamilar with. It would seem they have all the bases covered from head to toe. I like these ""decks"" because I don't always have the patience to go to a fitness class or watch a DVD and if I know and understand many of the exercises I can do them myself at home. Olivia Miller also authors the Yoga Deck which is another superb product."
5,Envision EN7419 ROCKS,"I bought this sweet baby from Compusa for $179.00 and the moment i plugged it in, i just fell in love with it. this monitor has specs comparable to any Sony, Viewsonic or NEC and looks sweeet. It is priced almost half of what a good Sony or Viewsonic and backed by 3 year manufacturers warranty. havent seen any dead pixel. response time 16ms and 450:1 contrast ratio. i did my homework before actually buying this and i am glad i made the right choice. saving some money is nice too."
2,Great Price but be prepared to sacrifice quality,"The thing that bothered me most about this monitor is the dead pixels. I never knew such a problem existed until I bought this monitor. I get a new one about every month, and boy is it annoying. The picture is crisp and clear and has very little ghosting, but you will have to replace it in a year or less. I am shopping for a new monitor right now, and I am avoiding Envision products."
5,Quiet Goodness,"Simple, timeless vignettes that capture the feel of Booker T. Washington. It is a short piece, but one filled with quiet dignity of men and women who went the extra mile to be good citizens in every day settings."
3,Looking beyond skin color,"Heroes In Black Skins is a compilation of short stories that show how former slaves show compassion to a world that was less than caring about them with glimpses into loyalty, societal responsibility, responsibility, etc. all the qualities of that make man human. Wouldn't it be wonderful to see these ""heroes"" as just that and not Heroes In Black Skins? But then, that was the point Booker T. was making...right!?"
5,Good Book,"It was very informative. Good iunformation, just not enough . I would like to have more people in the book. I enjoyed what I did read."
1,Lame,"This is a collection of stories Booker T heard throughout his life. They are all jumbled together without rhyme or reason. He makes little reference as to who told the story... just say's somthing like ""I heard this from a man in Ohio"". This would be a very poor purchase... especially if you are a history buff."
1,Fell apart after a few years,Started out fine but over the course of about 3 years:1. Paint/finish pealed away in big chunks.2. Started leakeing where hose connected to faucet. I don't mean where it screws on but the metal fixture in the faucet handle.3. Won't fit back in body so sticks outWould not recommend this faucet ever.
2,Not worth the money,"We purchased this faucet as a replacement for one we had that leaked. Installation was difficult. We have had it about 18-months now, and it does not fit back in the handle after you take out the sprayer arm to say, rinse out the sink. It has about a one-inch part that won't go all the way in flush with the rest of the handle. It also has stopped turning left to right very well, so the rane of motion is now very limited. It stained and chipped as well around the edges of the surfaces. I will not buy anything from American Standard from now on. Very disappointed."
4,Mr. Northrop would have been proud!,The B-2 has already proved everything Mr. Northrop believed in - the flying wings were the way to go. This book not only describes the B-2 but all the flying wings that preceded it.
5,Daddy Daughter Dinner Dance Danced into my Heart,"This extraordinary book is so heartfelt and beautiful. It is a testimonial on how families any families can find a way to care for one another though they may not be your ""everyday"" tradtionalfamily. Indias drawings, and singing voice are amazing. In addtion to the book being absolutely delightful,the music CD is so special. ""How do you say I love you?""-- you just say it.This is a must read for anyone who has a heart. It is infectious with love! Hurry and write another one, Bill Quateman-- you're making a positive change in this world, and this is a gift to all of us!"
2,healthy styrofoam,"better than most rice cakes I've tasted. With 6 g protein per serving and 3.5g fat,they are healthier alternative to chips."
2,Hmmm :),"This poster could have been my favorite , but it was printed on cheap flimsy paper . I'd recommend finding a shop that has clearer images and sturdier paper ."
4,A great single for a great track,"This single was pretty good. The b-sides (Melatonin and A Reminder) are reasonably good. My favorite among the two is a reminder, because it truly does represent sounds from both OK computer and Kid A. The reason i gave it four stars instead of five is that, for the price, the single does not contain enough. if melatonin were a bit of a stronger track, it might have been. overall, though, this single is a good purchase, for the bsides. if you just want paranoid android you might as well buy the album."
3,low brow comedy/mystery...fun to watch,This comedy/mystery is fun to watch.Abbott@costello seem to be enjoying themselves. The supporting cast is excellent//perhaps the best of all their films//Abbott@costello meet Frankenstein might match it//. Guess what ? NO MUSIC! Every sequence shows how the team milked all their comedy material..The microphone used in the radio quiz show scene is the actual one from the Kate Smith Radio Show that they appeared on in the late 1930's. It was a good luck charm.... I know every Abbott @costello fan will enjoy this film.
4,High energy A & C with more laughs than most,"I've seen most of their comedies but this one slipped past me until recently. Costello is really revved up in this one doing his Curley Howard imitation, tripping over everything and getting outsmarted by just about everyone. His opening scene as a soda jerk making a limburger cheese sandwich is hilarious. Abbott has some great moments also, trying to show Lou how to use a water fountain and trying to explain that watts are volts. This is a fun movie and a special treat for fans of A & C. An added plus...No boring songs!"
5,good tape measure,This has a good mechanism. I like the vinyl coating. It doens't cost much. Every home needs a good tape measure.
2,Adventures in Packaging,This works fine once you get it unpackaged. The hard plastic requires strong sharp (at least when I started out) scissors to open. Where to cut is not intuitive. It's particularly hard to get the plastic loose from the belt clip. I will keep the product now that I got it open but deduct two stars for the thoughtless packaging.
3,Great Tape - Horrible Packaging,"This is a beautiful, cost effective tape measure. You won't find this brand in the big box stores. Great that Amazon carries these items and provides ""Prime"" shipping. Getting the tape out of the plastic packaging was very difficult - Larry David of Curb Your Enthusiasm could relate well to unpacking this item."
3,Great price and value for money,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. It was received on time. Overall a solid product, great price and value for money."
1,Dollar store quality,"I pulled it about 3/4 of the way out--maybe 9 feet or so, and the thing just broke off it's roller, and does not retract. A complete POS.It's always been my policy not to buy cheap equipment because it costs more to buy something cheap two or three times than it does to spend more for quality once. I decided to ignore this rule, and a broken tool is the result. I'm going back to my original policy:Spending once cost less than saving twice."
4,Great tape,"Cannot beat the price, seems it will last just as long as the more expensive options. Hard plastic tape, good pull back and lock."
5,a nice tape measure at a great price,"I wanted to buy an extra tape measure that I could use when I was too lazy to get my ""good"" tool.I was very pleased to find the Komelon was of much higher quality that I expect and works just as well as my much more expensive tool.It's a great deal for less than $4. I'm very happy"
4,Great,"Item came as described the pull out tape is strong and not flimsy, highly recomment, it did not get a 5 star cause it did occassionally jam however just need to tug on it a little and it will reset itself. Overall very happy with it due to size and performance."
5,"Good product, great value","I am a professional woodworker and use tape measuresAll day everyday, this one has quickly become my favorite. Itis easy to read and not so large as to get in the way"
2,Why bother?,"This falls under the ""why bother"" category. There is no challenge covering an Aerosmith song unless you can improve it by reinventing it. You won't hear any creativity here. Some of the various artists are Mark Slaughter with Albert Lee; Ted Nugent with Tony Franklin and Vinnie Colaiuta; Vince Neil; Mickey Thomas with Earl Slick, Tommy Shaw; Ronnie James Dio with Yngwie Malmsteen; Fee Waybill with Tim Bogert and Tommy Aldridge; Jeff Keith with Tony Levin (on stick no less); Jani Lane with Chris Holmes; Stephen Pearcy with Tracii Guns and Aynsley Dunbar. The one song that stood out over all this other pedestrian crap was ""Same Old Song and Dance"" by Jack Russell (Great White) who teams up with Jeff Baxter and Edgar Winter."
1,ni se,lo compro por el nombre espero que este bueno porque estoy harto de que mi novia lea puro mafufo oriental.
2,Useful but flawed,This capsule history is a mix of material derived from official histories interespersed with personal recollection. The author covers an enormous span of material with reasonable succces. New to American readers are the insights into the developmentof the British bomb. An otherwise readable account is marred by numerous mistakes which detract from the credibility of the rest of the book.The book is a nice one-time read.
5,Aprende espanol ahora!,"I began using this series prior to traveling to Mexico to do healthcare mission work in the rural underserve areas and I can't tell you what a blessing this series has been to me and my work. If you want to learn functional Spanish and you're not necessarily interested in the Spanish language as an academic area of interest, then you should stronly consider this series."
3,Works... but not sturdy enough,"The case doesn't close very securely and the phone can easily fall out if dropped. I had to superglue velco strips on the clasp to keep it from opening when falling. Also, the belt clip doesn't stay screwed in when in use. It often unscrewed over the course of a day, and the case+phone would fall to the floor. I solved this by supergluing the threads so that it wouldn't unscrew anymore.After 4 months, the case finally snapped in the back. I'm not sure what happened, but I think that the case couldn't support the weight of the phone with the extended battery.Otherwise, I feel this case has provided ample protection against falls and whatnot after my modifications above. I've dropped my phone several times, and this case has kept it safe (except for the antenna) each time. There were a few occasions where even the phone fell out despite the velco clasp. But this is better than nothing."
2,Might be good for Cats,"Positive it was shipped quickly.Other reviewers have mentioned using this as a cat or dog toy and that might be one way to make use of this, becauseit is not an effective horse training tools. We do not use a whip to touch the horse but need something to keep the horses attention. This was ineffective and disappointing. Paid $7 more and got just what we wanted but had to wait for shipping that took 2 full weeks."
3,Dressage Tapper,"I use this tapper to get my horse's attention at the shoulder or flank. The length is perfect. The bright color makes it easy to find in the arena sand. It's not a rigid whip though, if that's what you need."
3,Just what we needed,"However, the model I chose was a bit small for our bathroom and I ended up getting a larger heater."
2,Not really necessary!,"I bought the Wedgits Delux set for my 5 year old and got the building board to go with it, certain it would make playing and building with it easier. 99% of the time the Wedgits are in a completely different room in the house - the building board totally forgotten. Could have purchased another set of Wedgits instead (that's where all the fun and learning is anyway!)"
3,unnecessary,It's a really unnecessary accessorie. If you're building on carpet a lot it would be helpful but the kids never seem interested in it when they're using their wedgits
2,wedgits not as exciting as they look,"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter with the ""pink"" wedgits set. She loves pink, but she didn't love this. My son played with it a few time, but looses interest quickly as it is not as fun as legos. One of the small wedgits broke very soon after we got it, but that did not affect their interest in it. It just isn't as exciting as it looked to me in the store."
4,Purchased as a gift,I bought this as part of my grandson's Christmas gifts. It's smaller than I expected but it meets the need we purchased it for.
4,Dual purpose creme,"I do like the creme more so than the oils I was using. Only drawback so far is that if you forget to seal the container tightly it forms a scab which has to be removed otherwise mixing it in will only cause ""pieces"" to collect on your clients skin."
4,pretty but petit.........,"This is a soft flowing nightgown very slinky and sexy, but the sizing seems a bit off, I wear a large but ordered an XL to be on the safe side and could barely pull it over my back side! Runs very small indeed, I would say the XL is about equal to a size 10. Elegant lacy stretch top and satiny smooth skirt but only for the petit or slender."
2,a disapointment,"well, just looking at the cover you might see to half naked females makeing out, it was for this reason that i bought this anime. i thought it was lesbian hentai, but it is NOT! I would describe it best as a comidy with a hint of fan service. the picture on the cover comes from one of the characters dreams, the two girls really never even touch. so if your lookin for a bit of a laugh then go ahead and buy this, if your lookin for hentai, take your money elsewhere."
5,"Well, Sure, I Guess....","Boredom and an extra 2.50 make for an evil cocktail, and I ended up renting Strange Love. Which, I give five stars because there was nudity and sex, and in retrospect, that's all I was looking for anyway."
1,Bad Example,"I DVR'd this movie on TCM recently. Thank goodness I had the capability to fast forward. I thought perhaps this would be a sweet 50's movie about a husband tempted, but who ultimately chooses his love, his wife. Not at all. Do not let any one below the age of 25 see this movie. This movie sets a bad example to all people, particularly girls, about how to handle a cheater. This movie makes the cheating husband look like a victim and women only look catty. Avoid at all costs! This movie should come with a warning!"
1,really bad service,"I cannot review the dvd as I have not yet received it. I am seriously disappointed in this whole process. I ordered this item through Amazon and was sent the wrong item. Then,in order to attempt to get the item I ordered, I had to pay for the return of the wrong item and three weeks later and 5 dollars postage, I am still waiting for the item that I ordered and have already paid for.This whole situation has caused me to think very hard about ever ordering from Amazon again."
1,"Not as good as ""The Women""","Don't waste your money and time on this, the oridinal is much better with an all female cast with great stars--Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Paullette Goddard, Rosalind Russell, etc.--and directed by George Cukor. Much, much better than this remake."
3,Worth a Look,"The Opposite Sex is a color musical version of The Woman that incorporates men into the cast. It stars June Allyson as Mrs. Hilliard, a woman whose husband of ten years is having an affair with a showgirl, the sexy Crystal Allan (Joan Collins). The two have even more connections; their lives are tangled in a web of gossip spread by the catty women of New York in beauty parlors and in powder rooms or anywhere else they can get a moment together.The cast is outstanding and the music is fun enough, but the film is much too long to hold one's attention thoroughly. There is too much talk and not enough action.The movie is much different than the original. Although some of the names, scenes, and lines have remained the same the fact that men are seen certainly changes the film. Also, Allyson's victimized wife is much more likable than Norma Shearer's sheepish version. In turn, Collins' Crystal Allan is easier to hate than Joan Crawford's catty gold digger."
3,Jungle Red!,"I do love this movie. What stands out the most is the focus on the salon everyone wanting Jungle Red nailpolish.Joan Collins(the cats meow)is to die for,did ja see her nails Jungle Red baby.Then June Allyson trying to be a goody - goody,(yeah right) when she approaches Joan Collins regarding her husband and daughter not fighting the urge one bit to keep from slapping the ear-rings off her ears. JUNGLE RED! The amount of adrenaline in that hand which almost knocks Joan Collins to the ground is one hell of a scene.The title song June sings sends endorphins up my spine.The gown she wears is of course in the shade of ""Jungle Red."""
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!,"This is my favorite movie. I am so glad it is finally on DVD. My mom would always have my aunt record old movies and musicals off cable TV when I was little and this happen to be one of them. I fell in love with this movie and June Allyson the first time I saw it. I frequently check Amazon for June Allyson movies and was super excited to see ""The Opposite Sex"" on DVD, so of course I purchased. I have seen the Meg Ryan version and I don't not care for it at all. I have never seen the original, so I can't say it's best out of the 3. I just know it is my favorite movie, I could watch it everyday and never it tired of it."
3,please put on dvd.,June Allyson was one of the biggest stars of the 1950s and her movies deserve to be put on dvd. This is another good movie with June Allyson.
5,The opposite sex,This movie never gets old....the remake with Annette Benning and meg Ryan is a dud! There is no comparison and this is highly recommended.
1,Terrible product,"These trimmers look nice and thats about it. What a poor product. I have been doing hair for 6 years. I work in a salon 5 days a week. I just bought these trimmers you have to push very hard to get them to cut the hair line. They are terrible. I guess you get what you pay for, save your money and time go with something else very very poor product."
4,This was really good!,"I was amazed at how much I actually liked this book. It all seemed very ""Yahhooo!"" flag waving at first, but not unlike a season of ""24"", it was more than I thought it was going in! It was a complicated plot that unfolded very nicely, and, I don't want to give anything away, but anywhay, it's very cool. And the Atlantians are awesome! The art was really detail-oriented and fun to look at, it really helped progress the story. This book also hits on several different themes, including environmentalism and race relations, very cool stuff. A must read!"
2,Didn't help much,"First use seemed to work well, but that was right behind taking Prevacid. The next time (a few days later) it didn't seem to help much. I needed to take tums to finish the job."
3,Colorado mystery,This was the first Zigal mystery I have read. Kurt Muller is an interesting protagonist. He has almost as many faults as whose he investigates!
3,Review,good story in a series of detective novels regarding a sheriff in a small town and the people he grew up withs
4,i'm a fan of serial books...,"having said that, i wasn't sure i was going to like the muller series. after reading three of the four, i can tell you that i do enjoy the reads. they are light and fluffy mysteries with a bit of a hippie-innocence feel to them. i also appreciate that the story doesn't rely too much on blood and gore for its plot to flow but does have a good amount of suspense, which i like. would they make me pre-order the next book in the series? no, but it would make its way onto my ""read"" list."
4,An individual coping with a brain tumor,"I wanted to read an individual's account post surgery who had a brain tumor. I believe this gentleman gave an interesting and thought provoking story about his experience. Moreover, he shared his ongoing problems and successes. I commend him and wish him a long healthy, happy, life with his supportive family.Evelyn O'Reilly, RN, EdD"
1,Do not buy this Invicta Lupah,"Mine turned up on time. But, with a broken bezel as a consequence of the poor quality. Do not buy one of these."
4,Does the job!,"We have an old, fancy one piece toilet that has an American Standard 212 seat. Fortunately this was stamped on the back of the toilet seat, so I could search for the seat on the web. It is an elongated and curved and quite special seat. I as able to find it on Amazon, it was delivered reasonably quickly, a week or so, and it worked. Hurrah! Much better than getting a new toilet, even though the seat itself cost more than a new inexpensive toilet. That's because it is rare."
3,Good quality but too expensive,"Had a 35 year old toilet that worked fine, just a broken lid. This matched perfectly, looks good, and installed easily. Just found the price offensive."
1,Who are you kidding,"Buy this book at your peril. The author of this book has, it would appear, done alot of research and he wants you to know it. The book is difficult and language laborious. This might be an ok read for advanced sociologist but for your average computing proffessional or student of computing its a waste of time."
4,Solid Sophomore Release!,"It's easy to dismiss Jake Andrews as just another SRV impersonator from Texas. In fact, Jake's first release, ""Time To Burn"" was so under promoted and unappreciated that he found himself looking for a second label for this second release. However, one listen to this CD and the listener soon discovers that this is an individual with an abundance of talent in his guitar playing as well as his vocals and song writing ability. The CD itself has a heavy, ZZ Top meets SRV quality more in the vein of Gov't Mule than a Kenny Wayne Shepherd or an Eric Johnson. Check out ""Better Start Now"" and ""Prince Of The World"" to get an idea of what this disc is truly about. The tone on the first track sounds a little muddy and may not be to everyone's liking however, after that, it's rockin' blues nirvana. No signs of a sophomore slump here."
2,PRETTY AWEFULL,"ANDREWS first CD showed promise and his very original voice was a bonus. While the songs were OK, the guitar playing was very good. On this release his voice starts grating on you from track one ( think a wheezy DOYLE BRAMHALL singing off key ) and it doesn't get any better. He has nothing to say and the guitar playing is without any fire or originality. The production is muddy and doesn't help either. All the songs are superfluous attacks on most BLUES cliches without adding a thing. The lyrics, if they can be called that, are a muddled assembly of blues cliches that make absolutely no sense. If JAKE was still 10 or 12, the guitar playing might be impressive, but at 24 it sucks and is a backward step when compared to his earlier effort.If I listed the better offerings available in this category, this review would be pages long. This is one very poor offering from a muso who should have done a lot better."
4,Good introductory pamphlet,"A very nicely done brief discussion of British teaware, mainly cups and coffee cans. The text is short but informative. The pictures are excellent, well selected, and clearly reproduced, with useful captions. Good on handle types. My only objection is the price which is steep for such a very short book, though I feel it was worth it to me because of the fine pictures which I will continue to refer to."
3,Not as helpful as I wanted,You would think that it would have had EVERY company from England in this book but it didnt so i really needs to be updated and more pics added.
4,"arthur's great, wish it was longer","We like the Arthur series, these computer games seem kind of easy to beat though, I think it took just one day for my 7 year old son to beat everything, but the game is repeatable."
1,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NO COLORS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This thing does not show the image in colors, just black and white! And the returning policies are very poor; this prevents them to give your money back. Please save your time and money, and do not buy this junk."
3,"When they say ""Colonial White"" they don't actually mean white...","The item itself is fine. It fits, was easy to install, good quality, etc.My ONLY problem is that it is NOT the color pictured. It isn't even remotely white, or off white. The color is more like... smoker's teeth yellow, but darker. But, returning it and then waiting for a replacement in the right color was going to take more time and money than I was willing to spend on a $6 part. A $2 can of spray paint took care of it."
2,No effect,"My 10 year old (120+ pounds) took one of these with each meal, along with her normal digestive enzymes. We were hoping it would help her with weight loss but we saw no difference."
2,"Pretty, but a disappointment","I was really looking forward to this book, but was disappointed by its narrow focus. I wish Kidston had shown more examples than just her own home. And while I did like her decorating style, it was most irritating to keep flipping back and forth between text and photos, trying to figure out if the picture next to the text was an example of what she was describing (and often it wasn't) or if the photo 3 pages ahead was really what she was describing. I came away feeling that I really hadn't gathered any usable information for my own home."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"As a big fan of the ""Shabby Chic"" books...I thought I'd try this one as well. I came away pretty disappointed. One of the biggest frustations with this book was that the text did not relate to the visuals on the page...Often the photo was several pages ahead or didn't appear at all. And I'd say visual references are pretty important when writing a decorating book. Am I supposed to imagine what this room looks like? The photos that do appear aren't very good...many left me wondering what they even were. If you like this style of decorating, stick to the Shabby Chic books by Rachel Ashwell. They are a much more inspirational and well written series--and the photography is much, much better."
2,Not quite what I expected,"A very Pretty book - yes. Practical book - no, not for me. I'm in the process of redecorating my whole house...these suggestions were a bit to ""precious"". If I had a country house or a beach house this would be perfect -- but for everyday living -- it leaves something to be desired. I wanted something a bit more ""meaty"" than crocheted hanger covers, and knitted throws and charming cloth bags for loose corn and lentils. As I said - very pretty but not for me."
5,Awesome Book,"This is a great decorating book. It has a lot of ideas for ways to incorporate vintage style in practical ways. I love vintage style! Its an early book for Cath Kidston, and its a little different that the more recent books she's done. But its still wonderful. I'd say a bit more shabby chic than the more recent ones."
3,Fair,"Pretty pictures, but too many were repeated ~ if I wanted to see the same picture twice I'd buy two of the book! It needed more shots with a wider angle. Also quite a bit of reduntant text."
5,"love,love,loved it",loved this book!very easy reading with beautiful photographs.i found this book very insipirational.i know have some great gift ideas for the future.kellie
5,Another Great Love Story..,I am a lover of Ms. Jackson's love stories. I have and will continue to read them all the time. They are great and they always have a great storyline. Keep the coming..
5,True Love,"I read the book from the Madaris Family Series and I love anything Brenda Jackson writes. I am a avid reader and I think she is one of the best writers around.Lanie,Pat brewer"
3,"""True Love Conquers All""","True Love was a good novel to read, even though it did get boring the more I read. Sometimes, the supporting players' storylines are better than the main characters'. The novel should have focused mainly on, Breanna and Trent, Callie and Paul, and even Thomas for that matter. Nick and Shayla.....snooze city!!!!!"
3,ok,"Another good one from Brenda Jackson, I actually liked the romance of Trent and Brenna more so than the lead characthers Shayla and Nicholas, I felt they moved to fast, but still a good read."
5,Love!!!,"I wish I could find a man like Blade! I read this book in one sitting, I love it so much. I am big Brenda Jackson fan"
4,Love Is What Really Matters,"I finished True Love in one sitting -- no surprise there, I loved it. Ms. Jackson's characters are always interesting and her style of writing holds your attention to the very last sentence. Brenda Jackson is one of the queens in the writing industry, a star in the making. After reading one of her novels you are guaranteed to want to read another and another until you've read them all. I've been following her career from the beginning and the quality of her work just keeps getting better. My favorite novel by Ms. Jackson has always remained ""One Special Moment."" ""One Special Moment"" actually made me slowly exhale at its conclusion and not many novels have had that effect on me. Ms. Jackson is definitely one of those authors you can take to the bank because you'll never walk away saying why did I waste my money buying this novel. With Ms. Jackson's novels you'll always be left wanting more -- take that from someone who knows."
3,OK but...,"a bit too much distraction. I mean the story line is followable, but once my heart goes to one scene, the story jump to someone elses story. You know, Trent. And by the time we get back to Nick the feeling is fresh and new. Basically everyone is linked to everybody in the company. so, it is really like the operasoap kinda story. U could say this after you read the conversation.. very dramatic and hmm.. too simple!Read it. Not too bad really, but not the best either."
5,"""True Love"" Conquers All","Brenda Jackson does a masterful job of weaving connecting stories yet each one stands great on its own. The story of Nicholas and Shayla shows true love leaves no room for hate, revenge, or anger. It also shows love is not enough but needs more components to survive. This is beautifully shown with Nicholas and Shayla, Trent and Brenna, as well as Paul and Callie. This story fits a line from Mrs. Jackson's previous novel 'Secret Love'. ""Nothing is as safe as a secret forever."""
4,"Good Quality, but not Great","I would've given this 5 stars, but the grease fitting wouldn't screw in like it was supposed to. I had to chase the threads, so not a major problem, but still, I've never had this come up before. I would still buy Moog products, though. Overall, they are much better than average."
3,Length and Breadth,"Goes to some extent covering the length and breadth of wireless baseband transciever and techniques. However really becomes encyclopediac than a solid treatment of concepts. Good chapters on space time coding though, but really not a recommendation for serious concept mongers."
5,kept me laughing all the way through,"This book really lifted my spirits. I have MS and also happen to be a Teri Garr fan, so I really was interested to see what she had to say about life. It was hysterically funny a lot of the time and sadly funny some of the time. I was very touched by her personal story.Thank you to Teri for sharing her story!"
2,This book was a disappointment,Ms Garr writes about her interaction with other stars and very little about her illness. I felt it was a book about who she rubbed elbows with and not much else
4,"Delightful actress, delightful writer","Even if she didn't write it all by herself, still the tone is very-terri. (I agree with the reviewer who said ghost writers ought to get more than a little credit.) Honest, funny, uplifting, and inspiring...lovely book."
3,More about Hollywood than MS,"From the review I'd heard about this book on NPR, I purchased it as a gift for a friend with MS thinking it would encourage her. As I glanced through it, I realized the book really is more about the entertainment industry and Ms. Garr's friends and family. This is interesting reading but only the last few pages in the book address MS and then not in a way that seems meaningful to someone who is confined to a wheelchair."
4,Awesome...mysterious,"Janet wants a horse bad, and her parents wont even let her buy half ownership in one. Angry, Janet goes to bed and dreams that she is riding a mystical white mare...and finds out the mare is real and that its owners are living in the arroyo. Or are the mare and her owners real? You'll find out! It is a mysterious book. I loved it. It tingles the senses. The only problem is, Janet is acting like a brat because the white gelding, a lesson horse she rides, isn't perfect and beautiful with a flowing mane and able to jump five feet, so she's mean to it. She acts like the only horses are those who jump the moon and have brilliant color and dainty legs and are like dogs."
1,Do NOT buy this Dvd!,"This is by far the biggest waste of money out there. IT is NOT a movie. It is two stinking episodes of a show with ok action, a decent storyline and bad dubbing. Plus if you want to see the rest YOU CAN'T its the only one of these! I made the mistake of not returning this after I got it for my birthday. If you buy this you will definitely be sorry."
1,a waste of time,this movie start cold way until the end of the film. There isnt even a real ending.The bad guy lives happy in his place while the 4 so called dragon kings go home.a complete waste of time
2,Does NOT natively work with World of Warcraft,"If you want to use it with World of Warcraft (which I imagine LOTS of people might like to do), you'll need to convert every screenshot you take into one of this programs native formats (.jpg, .bmp, or .gif). These are very standard formats and I guess Blizzard deserves some of the blame for saving all screenshots (in the Windows version) as .TGA files (a not-quite-so-standard format). But I have NO IDEA what they were thinking, releasing an app for making your own comics out of screenshots and not including native functionality for the most massively hugely popular Role Playing game EVER! Support .TGA files and the app would be really fun and useful. I didn't use it enough to objectively rate the functionality if you want this software for other games besides WoW. Seems decent, I think."
5,What a wonderful new toy! What a great tool!,"While comic book creator is a great amusement, it looks like it could actually be quite useful in creating readable, printable comics. Beyond comics it is quite a useful educational tool for learning visual storytelling. To me this means things like advertising, instructional aids and movie story boards.This is pretty easy to use: if I can figure it it out and start using it write away, certainly a child can!"
1,Caution!,"Go to the company's website and check out their forums. There's nothing but problems with this program. I have it and I'me very dissatisfied. The layout and tools work very well, but when it comes to actually turning out a finished product in any format (jpg, pdf or bmp) I've have NO success. I've waited paitently through 3 versions of the program with no improvements in this area."
1,Watch out for that license!,"If you read the license, you find that you probably give away rights to anything you use in a comic book. It also looks like you can't give away copies of comics you print, certainly can't sell them, and can't let others copy them.Unless you want your child's face on a cereal box without your permission, you probably don't want this software."
2,Try the demo before you buy,"Pros: very easy to useCons: Very simplistic, few menu options, limited number of included images.As an amateur Photoshop user, I found this software too limited to do anything useful. I downloaded the demo version from the manufacturer's web site, and tried to make a sample Sci-Fi comic page.None of the included background images were even remotely useful. So I decided to skip the background and look for some clip-art characters to use. Again, there wasn't much of a selection.If you've used Photoshop at all, CBC has very limited usefulness. If you're into designing your own online art, I would recommend Photoshop Elements 2.0 (~$100)."
4,Great service and good product,I bought this for my grandson for Christmas. He was so excited about it that he left his other gifts in order to try it.
1,Not what was promised,"This program is limited to a few word bubbles and sound effect fonts.It is difficult for a novice to understand how to get his or her own pictures into the comic. The word bubble sdo not rotate, so they could be pointing anywhere except where you want them to.It looks really great on the cover of the CD, and that's what sold me.It was a disapointing christmas."
5,Great!,this comic book creator is awsome i can finnaly create my stick figure comics without hand writing and drawing them with a pencil! its worth buying!
3,"I wanted to like this, but it was too limiting","There's some good things here (some nice fonts, for example), but ultimately I found using Comic Book Creator too frustrating. For example, the speech balloons reproduced with jagged edges. Also, the clip art bundled with the program is pretty lousy, though you can import your own.Worst of all, one has to choose the page layout as a first step. So later, if you decide you want to insert a frame between two others, it can't be done.Perhaps there are workarounds for these problems, but they weren't immediately apparent."
1,WARNING! OBSOLETE and UNSUPPORTED!,"I bought a copy of this and discovered that the tools included are not enough to make anything very interesting. When I tried to find additional content, all websites that mentioned Comic Book Creator explained that the software was no longer available from any source. If you buy this software you will have bought into a dead end. Before the company went out of business, there were content packs for all kinds of subjects from Marvel Comic heroes to pets. But not anymore."
3,Fun to get started with.,"This is a fun software to get started with. My husband felt it was a little elementary and not what a serious comic book designer would want. However, it does let you use your own artwork if you want, or images from other games, clipart, etc. We haven't really explored it all yet, but so far so good. If you are truly looking for something you can publish your own work and sell from...this isn't it. However, its fun to play with and hone your skills."
4,Ambition and madness,"The Pantos Cantos takes us back to the days of Modernism when artists had heart and desired to experiment. These days, writers have to pander to illiterate readers, ambitious editors and know-nothing marketing departments. This is in-your-face art for art's sake, gloriously elitist, ugly, difficult, sprawling, all that good and high art should be. Who needs readers? Who needs post-modernist defence of the popular and accessible?"
5,"An incredible tale of courage, beautifully told","Strictly a non-western book about the West. Slave trade among the Indians, overcoming racism that was/is part of every group--I've never read these topics covered so vibrantly. Working to build a life, getting lucky, meeting catastrophe and facing challenges: these are not only what we consider to be the strength of the American character, they are the strengths of any human fully living his or her life. Then, as now, life was complex, bringing about complex choices. Those that are the most difficult often place another's welfare ahead of our own. That brings out the finest in us--finding strength in many situations, that's what Heaven is a Long Way Off is all about. A terrific read for anyone."
5,Would I do the same?,"What an inspiring book with a great message. Many of us are faced daily with opportunities to make a difference in people's lives. WAI KIKI has had several in his lifetime and this book tells about his will and ""ability"" to ""make a difference"". Many of the stories gave me chills and left me asking myself ""would I do the same?"", WAI KIKI is an amazing individual who had the ""call"" and then did something about it.This book is uplifting, riveting and heartwarming and is a good read for anyone."
4,The Bible of Baseball Cards,"If you collect baseball cards you absolutely must have this book. It catalogs virtually every baseball card ever made, including variations and errors.Why only four stars and not five? Subtle reasons, mostly. The main reason is that this book, despite being released recently, does not do a very good job of covering the professionally graded baseball card market. This is even more surprising as Beckett does have a grading service of their own. As such, the sections covering the history of baseball cards and how to grade cards is lacking and is pretty much a reprint of what's been appearing in Beckett books like this one for over fifteen years. They really could have done a better job of modernizing those sections.However, as a reference book to help identity cards and give approximate values, this book cannot be beat. Buy it now!"
2,German rock,"a typical German rock album, a typical Peter Maffay album. it seems to me that he must be very popular in Germany. or maybe somehow was very popular. i think that i liked this music better, if i understand the lyrics...anyway this album could be very interesting for some old hippies;)"
2,enigma is right,"What I found as an ""enigma"" after reading this book is howother people thought that this was a good book! There is nothinghere that has not been discussed elsewhere. I would recommend ""Brotherhood of the Bomb"" to learn about Oppenheimer and his contemporaries."
5,"An involving, highly recommended biographical survey","Oppenheimer: Portrait Of An Enigma is the biography of the preeminent American nuclear scientist has been a long-awaited book: Biographer Jeremy Berstein spent two years at the institute where Robert Oppenheimer was director, observed him nearly daily, and is in the perfect position to blend history with personal observation. The nuclear physicist Oppenheimer was key in creating the atomic bomb, and was a genius both scientifically and otherwise: Oppenheimer's science, background, and most of all the personal talks between biographer and scientist spice up a revealing, involving, highly recommended biographical survey."
5,Ingredient,I used this just to make chalkboard paint. That obviously is not its intended purpose but it worked magnificently! I was able to paint everything I wanted and still have a BUNCH left over.
3,"Compact, but not very easy to read","I got a good deal on this bible, and it looked nice, and I wanted this particular translation for my son. He likes it, but it's kind of smaller than I thought, and the binding makes it hard to open and read. Not very easy to read, just physically holding it open."
1,I wish I could rate zero stars,"I bought this CD last Friday and knew I had made a mistake within 30 seconds of the 1st song. I only made it through the 4th track before removing it from my CD player and returning to the store to exchange it. I can respect complex time changes, but being good at math does not make for good music. I heard nothing that could be considered a melody and also nothing that sounded like actual instrumental talent. They may know how to play their instruments, but they do not know HOW to play. Also, the production is terrible. The praise of this album strikes me as some kind of joke. It's that bad. If you want to listen to instrumental rock/metal made by talented muscians who know how to play and write music that is not painfull to listen to, check out Gordian Knot ""Emergent."""
2,ancient,"This book's writing is based on data from the end of the previous century (late 1800's into around 1920). Crummy pictures and drawings..all black n white. Just because they have recently reprinted a book, doesnt mean it is a recently written book by recent researchers or photography. But if you like to read ancient old data, this is the book for you."
2,Sparse funeral review,"This is just very basic sparse funeral planner. I was hoping and expected a complete plan to plan my loved one's funeral and it is really not that, would recommend buying a book not this very thin booklet. It is something that you would expect to get from a funeral home or a funeral planner."
5,Same color as standard lights,I ordered this from Amazon after being dissatisfied with CFL flood lights from the local home store. The problem was that the color and intensity of the light did not match the other incandescent flood lights (in the kitchen). This bulb matched perfectly and lit quickly.
4,"Soft white, some warm up time","Bought three of these for recessed lights, nice soft white/yellow glow (not the harsh white), there is a warmup time (about 1 min) for the lights to hit maximum brightness, but the time is not bothersome for us."
1,Defective bulb... didn't work at all,I bought two of these bulbs in March to replace high-ceiling bulbs. Finally got to installing it today and realized that one bulb doesn't work at all. Dead on arrival! Quite disappointing to say the least... my bad for not testing it before installing it 20 feet high!No issues with the other bulb. Takes some time to light up to full intensity but the brightness level is appropriate for high-ceiling use.Now I have to figure out how to get a replacement... :-(
1,Very Slow to Warm and Brighten,"Once this bulb warms up -- about 90 seconds -- it's fine, BUT there is a perceptible delay between switching it on and any light, then it comes on VERY low and only slowly brightens. I am not happy with it and probably should just send it back."
1,stay clear flickering problem,"takes time to warm up. does not dim, brighter than a normal 65 watt light bulb.I replaced 7 in my kitchen and now it looks like a garage its so brightupdate six months later.... had to replace all the bulbs because they were flickering so bad it was like a strobe light in my kitchen. stay clear"
4,Good replacement,Good replacement to the normal bulbs. This bulb does not generate a lot of heat which is what I was looking for.
3,A Deer Hunting Manual for New York State in the 1970's,"This book is very good if you want to know how to hunt in New York State in the 1970's. The chapter on processing the meat is very good because the guy is a professional butcher. His techniques on hunting are based on how to hunt in thick woods in the East Coast. I found none of his advice useful, because I hunt out West. To give an example, he recommends a semi automatic rifle with open sights. Out where I hunt almost everyone hunts with a bold action rifle and a scope."
1,The positive reviews have been faked by the author.,The book is one of the worst books on grappling and submissions ever written. The author has faked all of the positive reviews but everyone who has any legitimate grappling experience has openly stated this book is worthless. The author makes a lot of claims but do not waste your hard earned money on this book.
1,This man is a FRAUD!,"Why on earth would anyone want to learn martial arts from a con-man? The author's only intent is to ride brazilian jiu-jitsu's wave of success. Prior to it's popularity, the author was anti-grappling! Other highlights in the author's career include calling the cops on visitors of his school and allegedly beating up his wife (ironic thing to do for a rape prevention instructor). The author also holds the dubious distinction of getting 'banned' from 5 martial arts discussion boards due to his bad attitude. Spend your money on the 'Fergie Follies' instead."
1,PUUUUUULLLLEEEEEEZZZZEEEEEE!!!!,I have had dealings with this man (recently) He in my opinion is just trying to cash in on the grappling wave that is cresting currently in the world today!! I saw and read his book. What a farce!! I teach Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and would NEVER recomend this piece of garbage to my students. 1. Submissions? 2. (legitimate not fantasy) submission ground positioning? 3. Self promotion plain & simple. 4. By the way since when is Ron Van Clief a grappling authority??Rafiel Torre East-West Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
1,Not worth your time unless your a total novice!,"Please, if you are already a student of the submission game, do not waste your money on this book. It is non-descriptive and lacks any real substance."
2,where's the beef?,"When you buy a book called submission wrestling, wouldn't you expect to see a lot about submission holds? Well, maybe some people wouldn't, but I did. Though his book doesn't give out false, or bad information, the information within could be easily found on a few websites involving submission fighting, submission wrestling or brazilian jiu-jitsu.Perhaps the next book will contain more information about submissions and control and less self-promotion. I doubt I would risk spending the money on it. If you want a more comprehensive book I'd go with Gene LaBels new title or the fighters notebook, which contain more unique and well illustrated submissions that I can count."
4,Honest Opinion,"Rob is a great wrestler and has distilled his knowledge into this book. Seriously folks, this is a good supplement for learning moves. Anyways = a great book for your training. Very well spelled out."
1,Do Not Believe The 5 Star Reviews!,This book is completely worthless! The 5 star reviews were more than likely writen by the author. If you want a book on grappling buy Royler and Renzo Gracie's Jiu Jitsu book or Rigan Machado's book. All I have ever heard about Robert Ferguson is that he is a shameless self promoter. There is no person that I know of called Doug Gracie! Saying that Ferguson helped develop the Gracie family's jiu jitsu is damn near libelous!
1,This is poor book.,R. Ferguson once again as always shows just how much he thinks the public will actually beleive this.
5,Basics never change,"I have been training in the martial arts for over 10 years with little knowledge of grappling or submission wrestling. This book was great for me because it explained the basics and gave me insight into what makes grappling work. This book is not for the advanced, but it is a true winner for anyone wanting to take an intellectual approach to learning grappling."
2,World's loudest toy,"My son was given this dump truck as a present. It's sturdy and well-made, but unfortunately, it is deafening! I'm no stranger to loud toys: I have 4 kids and we have our share of noisy toys -- but this truck is far-and-away the LOUDEST toy any of my children have ever had. When my son plays with this tuck, the music and recorded truck sounds can be heard all over the house -- even on different floors and through closed doors. Not only does my son say the truck is ""really loud,"" and refer to it as ""my loud truck,"" but his siblings get annoyed by the loud noise whenever he plays with it, even if they are in a different room.It's a nice toy, but it would be much improved by either adding a volume control switch, or just taking the volume down a notch or two . . . or ten."
5,Great Beginner's Resource,"I just finished reading through my copy of the book and found it very useful. I'm glad to finally find a single book that covers all end of development - database access, web access, reporting, etc. I found the supporting code on the apress website for download. I think this book is easy to read and follow for a beginning .NET developer that wants to learn .NET and C# and how they are used to create real projects."
2,Questionable treatment of object/relational mapping and,"First, I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned the lack of complete, runnable source code as the most serious failing of this book. This is completely unacceptable. A number of folks have logged into the publisher's web site and complained about this.Regarding the content and explanations of concepts. I'd say, ""not terrible"". But I did not like the author's approach to object relational mapping. Make everything a stored procedure? Hmmm controversial, to say the least."
1,"Book concepts are good, Application is NOT Compilable!",Don't buy this book unless you want to spend hours trying to put text files into a solution/project structure. The concepts are are good but the project source is given in the form of several text files which doesn't make sense. It tries to build a application called an IssueTracker which I couldn't figure out how to compile let alone deploy. Forget this book. If the book just had a compilable solution it might have made sense.
1,Flimsy clock that does not keep time,"I accidentally posted the following review for the AB25A model, as the picture associated with that item looks like the clock I have. However, my order history tells me that my clock is an AB-25:This alarm clock is a terrible piece of junk. I purchased it from Amazon and within a month it stopped keeping accurate time. It lost as much as 30 minutes per day, prompting me to be late for work on more than one occasion. Amazon very graciously replaced the item with the same model. The replacement worked for a while, but within two months, the light that allows one to read the time in the dark stopped working. Another few weeks later the clock started to drift off the accurate time again. This clock is useless. You cannot read it in the dark once light bulb burns out, and even if you could read it, you could not trust the time it shows."
5,very Good protection!!!,Very good brand and the brand itself has a great reputation. Fits the guitar well.
2,Not Big enough inside,The case is made very well but the inside doesn't have enough room as it wouldn't fit my Stagg acoustic guitar and close without possible damage.
5,Great Case,"Took This Case on a plane a few weeks ago...had no problem what so ever. Sturdy plastic, hinges and buckles are sturdy as well. Great case. My only issue is that my fender acoustic is a tight fit...i believe at the bridge. It still fits great but i'm not sure if its causing unnecessary pressure. But the guitar made it on and off the plane no problem at all, and like i said, sturdy, good case. WELL WELL WELL worth the price!"
5,"Nice, but didn;t fit!",What a nice deluxe case. Wish my guitar would allow the lid to close. Very sturdy construction with a cushioned interior. Disappointed!!
1,guitar case,"The case itself is GREAT, but it is shorter than indicated on the website and hence the guitar does not fit, and the situation has not been resolved yet. Frustrating."
4,Fun filter,B+W makes the best filters on the market. This one is no exception. The filter feels heavy in your hand and the construction quality is solid. This is a nice filter to play with when there are lots of light sources in the area. You can transform a string of bulbs hanging outside into a string of stars. Or it can be used to accent a few light sources in the scene. My only regret is getting the 4x. I think the effect of the 6x better suits my taste.
5,McIllvaney is Incredible!,"Probably the most eloquent sportswriter I've encountered, he combines his wonderful writing technique with a thorough knowledge of the sport gleaned from years spent ringside. Best of all are his comments on the sport of boxing in general, which succinctly describe the multitude of paradoxes that exist within an environment that is at once brutal and, in its own way, incredibly noble. McIllvaney understands boxers and their suffering and transmits their lives so realistically, it's as if one knows them personally. You can't go wrong with this one!"
1,Perfect size for camping,"We take our guinea pig camping with us and it's the perfect size for our 5th wheel. It also makes a great cage for when you are changing their main cage. It's made well. I wouldn't recommend it for a full time cage, it's too small for a very active animal."
3,One of the weaker books on herbs.,"I hate to give this book a less than excellent review because I do like Michael Savage aka Michael Weiner. My main problem with it is it really never goes out on a limb and tells you which herb will cure what problem. It just paints a general picture with broad strokes. It's almost like the writers were spooked by the Medical Mafia, so there's very few recommendations that aren't hedged."
4,Very useful guidebook,"A very useful and well-organized reference book. Definitely one of the better books of the genre.I was surprised to learn, though, that the author is better known as Michael Savage, a very popular AM talk radio host heard around the country. I really find his political observations insightful and provacative, and I find his recommendations on vitamims and herbal remedies no less so."
3,Not quite as good as their more recent albums,"I am a big fan of the Austrian industrial/electro band L'ame Immortelle. The only problem is their music isn't or wasn't available at a decent price here in America. Not too long ago, the band finally re-issued their early work at a more affordable cost. One of the cds by them I wanted was ""Lieder Die Wie Wunden Bluten"" because I heard the lovely ballad ""Life Will Never Be the Same Again"" on the band's MySpace page and just had to have the cd. I have to say that ""Lieder Die Wie Wunden Bluten"" took me a few listens for the music to grow on me. The problem lies in the gutteral, cookie monster vocals of Hannes Medwenitsch which I found absolutely annoying. This is one of those rare situations where I prefer the band's more recent works than their older material, and this certainly applies here to L'Ame Immortelle's LIEDER DIE WUNDER BLUTTEN. I really wanted to like this album as much as their recent material but I honestly can't."
2,Sonja is great...but,"The male vocals in my opinion, ruin this cd. The demon, glutteral, style voclas are so distorted, you cannot make out most of the words. But Sonja's vocals soar...when she is permmitied to sing, which is only in a few places. It could have been so much better is the male vocals were not so prominent."
1,Disappointed,I bought 2 of these. One for the living room and one for the bedroom. 3 weeks after they arrived the one in the living started flashing like a strobe light. A week later the one in the bedroom lost all the colors except yellow which left the room dark mst of the time. I would not reccomend this product.
1,When do I get to see the mist?,A friend of mine got a similiar item that had an impressive amount of mist coming from it. I believe she had a button that controls how much steam you want. Unfortunately this one does not give you a choice nor did I see much steam at all. The dish part is so flimsy broke part of it the second day it was used. Still managed to run it and it still sucked. Not at all what I anticipated it and was bummed about it. I wouldn't if I were you.
2,fountain,had it two months the legs just broke no reason for it mywife was sitting in the chair in the same room and heard it fall
3,Mist maker died kinda quick,Kinda disappointed how quick the mist maker died but it lasted most the winter months and kept my apt humidified so I wasn't getting static shocked constantly.
4,happy memorial day,"it is altogether fitting that i should be listening to this recording a memorial day weekend, the first four selections sound like dirges, forms of solemn anthems, but incredibly rhythmic, as is the whole cd, the rhythm holds everything together and gives it majesty in a democratic way.things pick up with hop hip bip bir rip, with mitchell's sax as a ball of twine dropped that slowly begins to unravel before spinning crazily down a steep hill with everyone else in mad pursuit. hop hip etc reminds me of coltrane's my favorite things.bessis harris is a series of wonderful solos by the group members.fallen heroes attempts a talking horn, my guess as a eulogy.big red peaches is an upbeat tribute to robert johnson's hot tamales, hot tamales can be heard on cassandra wilson's belly of the sun. not to be disrespectful or anything, but listening to leola the second time around i heard a bit of big red peaches and for a brief moment had a vision of a big hip woman."
2,This album is NOT for everyone,"I am a pretty open-minded person when it comes to music, but I just could not get myself to enjoy this album. The music was erratic and moody, as if it was the soundtrack to a nightmare. I only recommend this album to listeners who can appreciate the art behind the music, not casual jazz fans such as myself."
4,Nicely done,"I am using this material and it's English companion to teach young pastors in rural Guatemala. It is not a page for page translation, so it took some extra time to synchronize my lessons with their text. Better than the Holman guide."
1,Not A Good Choice For Your Pigs,"Guinea pigs are prone to choking. The Sun Seed Grainola Bar has seeds that your pig could choke on.I don't know much about rabbits or chinchillas, perhaps this would be a better product for them."
3,Neither good nor bad,I didn't feel any different than with a cheapo foam insert. Maybe I was looking for a miracle insole... Didn't get it with these.
1,50 / 50 Chance With This Company,"Unfortunately I can't really comment of the flat/comfort insoles I ordered from Sorbothane. Tried ordering the men's insoles, Sorbothane sent the way too small women's insoles instead; even though the invoice inside the box even said men's. They had a 50 / 50 chance of sending the right thing and didn't. To me that says a lot about a company. If you order from them, good luck."
5,GREAT STORY. WELL RESEARCHED.,"Puts you right in the middle of 17th century Versailles, and you get a real feel of how people lived back then. Good research, wonderful story-telling. I wish the book could have followed Marie-Anne right up to her very last days."
5,Innovation on a large scale,"This is one of the most stunning films I have seen in any genre in a long time. The animation is crisp and fresh, the themes are exciting and though provoking, and the imagery is unlike anything that has proceeded it. The filmmakers have create a world that can't be referenced or compared to any that have preceded it. The viewer is rewarded for watching this move repeatedly, be it finding another layer of the story or noticing something beautiful they had not seen previously.This should be considered a mod sci-fi classic. Any fan of androgyny, williful pretension, or adventurous mind-blowing owes it to themselves to get this disc. I can't stress it enough."
4,A Fine Film,"Surreal and visually stunning, the Utena movie is a treat for fans of the series or anime fans in general.It should be noted that the film is not a continuation of the series' events. It is actually a quite satisfying retelling of Utena's story, with many inside jokes for series fans to enjoy along the way.I wouldn't suggest this to younger anime fans, since the film's themes are rather mature. But if you're of age, this film would be a fine addition to any anime collection."
1,"Well, I hate to say it, but I didn't like it","I was really looking forward to this movie. I came on board by reading the manga of Revolutionary Girl. It looked interesting, exciting. But when I got this, I felt like I was looking at a Lesbian Pink Floyde movie. At the very best! I didn't understand it...though I am smart enough to be disatisfied by the molesting scene, the lesbian scenes, and the incest hints. I might be a fairly conservative person, but I have enjoyed abstractions and scandelous actions in Neon Genesis, Coybow Bebop, Series Experiement Lain, and several other titles that are for adult viewers. I really didn't like this movie. Maybe it was too condensed (as some viewers say that its the tv series smushed down to eighty some minutes). But the scandelous sections dont make up for that. I just didn't like the movie. It just didn't work very well."
2,Poor,"The movie was really bad if you got the english dubbed anyway. It was very confusing and totally unlike the book at all. It didn't explain anything. Like for instance, near the end of the movie they say, ""let's go to the outside world!"" when you didn't even know that they were on an Inside. Most of the movie was music and the plotline was very well written. Also there was a lot of nude scenes. Maybe it's cause I only got to read the first book so I don't understand it all 'cause we don't have the show in America, but I didn't like the movie very much so I sold it to someone on the second day after I watched it."
1,"The series soars, but the movie sinks.",Where do I even begin? I absolutely LOVED the series. I couldn't get enough. I was flipping through the newspaper and saw the movie advertised. I was so excited. I got the movie later that day. I called my friend up who was also really excited by the series. We put in the movie and watched. What a disappointment it was! The movie takes all the fun out of the original series. It takes the humor and fun out of the series and replaces with soft porn. I made something very pleasant and made it oh so painful. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I wish I could get my money back. The DVD might make a good coaster. Peace out!
1,Revolutionary Girl Utena-The Movie - not like the series.,"Having been a fan of the entire series of Revolutionary Girl Utena I would advise any like-minded fan to avoid this movie. Granted the artwork is beautiful and a serious collector would likely be interested in owning it. However, many things have changed from the original series. The relationship between Utena and Anthy has turned dark and calculating and the other stories are too rushed and somber for this film. Plus you only get to witness a few duals with very little ""sword magic"" and the ending will leave you completely wondering why you wasted money on this and why the director wasted his chance to make a movie based on his truly wonderful series."
1,"Absolutely awful, don't get it if you liked rose collection","I don't know what all the other reviewers are thinking. This movie was awful, there was no continuity within the movie itself and no plot. The animation itself was incredible, but the story makes absolutely no sense. My husband and I both hated it so much we are almost turned off the Utena series entirely. We may still try a black rose collection when it comes out. Take my advice do NOT get this DVD, I think I am going to sell my copy. I wrote this review to warn people to stick to the rose collection and that is it."
2,A huge disappointment,"First of all, I loved, loved LOVED the series. What this movie has going for it has gorgeous imagery and the same caliber of voice talent of the series, but otherwise it fails in all the ways the series was intriguing and, well, likeable. Anthy's character is, instead of the tortured creature of the series, a flirtacious, giggly schoolgirl who practically forces herself on Utena and evokes little sympathy to carry us through to the ending. Much of the dialogue, heck, entire scenes are utterly incoherent to those who haven't seen the entire series. The seductive manipulation of Akio- gone. The well-developed modern mythology? Gone. The deep backstories and character insights? Gone. In a word, this movie, as a condensed storyline, managed to suck the wonderful aspects of the show out, which leaves a pretty but feeble creature of a movie behind."
2,Not worth it,"The movie is OK, but it's really not worth it. I have to admit that I was *very* depressed after watching the movie, it just isn't that good. If you haven't seen episodes 14-39, spend your money on some fansubs fof 14-39 instead of the movie. In my opinion, the Black Rose arc and the Akio arc are far better than anything found in the movie. Also, I don't quite care for how the characters are changed in the movie. And let's face it, the remix of the theme song just ruins it.Also, what's up with dropping the title? In Japanese, the title is Adolescence Revolution... too risque for the American market? :-)"
1,"Buy the series, not this movie","Let me start by saying that i loved the first two dvds of the series. Here I am crossing my fingers that they release the rest.I bought the movie, thinking I could get a glimpse of the ending of the series. But I was terribly dissapointed. The movie hardly tracks the lovable series. It is gloomy, dark, and uncomfortable to watch.The themes of incest and rape are very prominent. A little too much. There are no jokes or funny situations like in the series. You sink emotionally and dont come back up. There are many things that go against what you know from watching the series. And I couldnt care less for the car racing at the end...it was out of character...all of it.Perhaps there is artistic value, if you repackage it as something else but Utena. But if you are a fan of Utena from the series, you will end disappointed like me."
4,"Confusing, but good movie","I can totally see why people did not like this movie. It's hella confusing...but god help me I liked it. It felt so weird to see characters I knew from the t.v. show be different in the movie. I liked the difference though. The movie was ultimately weirder than the show and I recommend people to watch the show before the movie or if you've seen the movie to watch the show. If you watch this keep an open mind. Do not expect it to be exactly nor mostly remotely like the show. The movie is it's own entity. Also, please do not watch the dubbed version. The japanese version with english subtitles is much better than the dubbed version. Basically the dubbed version sux."
4,weird but cool nonetheless,"I've seen the OAV's and thought they were a bit on the strange side, but this one takes the cake. There is a lot of symbolism in the movie that you can miss if you don't pay attention. Okay, even if you do you could still miss the point, whatever that may be. I do love how they draw their characters in Utena, and the animation is very well done. Warning: this anime is not for children."
1,Beware,"What a major disappointment. This was intended as a gift for Christmas. I really wish that I had listened to the other 1 star reviews and avoided this product completely. We tried it on a bottle of room temperature wine for an hour before the desired temperature was on the readout. We felt the bottle and it was clearly NOT at 42 degrees. I double checked it with a infrared gun and it was still in the 50's. So not only did it take too long, the reading is inaccurate. I had looked into returning it and found that I would have pay for the shipping charges. Please look elsewhere for a better product and do not waste you time or money on this chiller."
1,Doesn't really do anything,"Well, I bought this ""brand new"" from a thrift store for $4. From the bits of wrapping paper on the bottom, it was obviously donated after being received as a gift. I bought it for use with beer, and found that it didn't really work with 12 ounce bottles, okay, fine. But then I go up to a 750 mL bottle, and it still doesn't remotely work. It's pretty obvious that it heats from the bottom and senses the temperature there, so if your bottle doesn't have a flat bottom, it's going to have no idea what temperature it's at. I put in a bottle from the fridge, hoping to warm it up instead of waiting for it to warm up on its own, and I have to set it above room temperature just to get it in warming mode. Thirty seconds later, it's ""warm,"" or rather, the bottom of the chilling compartment is. No effect on the bottle. Now if I could put water in there or something it would make sense."
1,Sorely Disapointed,"I recieved this cooler thinking it would have a smaller footprint than the Koolatron I had, I was wrong, the base is large and round, where the Koolatron is oval and large. This was not my only dislike, this unit sounds like a thrashing machine, the fan is very noisey, and the unit does NOT cool worth a hoot. I put a bottle in it and an hour later it was slightly chilled but not cold > > the Koolatron was way better in the cooling department. I finally boxed it back up and returned it, and ordered another Koolatron, a much better cooler for ths same approx. price."
1,Wine bottle chiller,"I'd stay away from this product, especially if you want chilled wine. Put a bottle in and wait and wait and wait and...........it will never get close to cold. Bought it as a sweetest day present for my wife and I feel like I cheated her."
1,Disappointed!,"Don't waste your money. A HUGE disapointment. Does not actually chill wine. I suppose it will help to ""maintain"" a temperature, but I never have a bottle open long enough to keep it at a specific temperature. After all...the reason you open it IS to drink it!"
5,The Best Collection of Italian Favorites,"I have never liked Jerry Vale very much, but when I first heard this CD, it touched my Italian soul. There are so many of my favorite songs, I don't know where to begin. I love most of the selections but the one most special to me is ""Tell Me That You Love Me"". It has to be one of the most romantic Italian ballads of all time....just beautiful. This is my second purchase of this CD since the one I had was accidentally destroyed. You can bet I will treasure this one with my life"
4,Scrapping on the PC,This was a gift to one of our family. She just love how easy it is to use. She has been using it to make a photo record of the growth of our Grandchild over the past years.
3,"Makes pages, not books","The graphics are high quality; however, this software only allows you to make one page files. If you are looking for software that will make books, this is not it."
3,Good as a starter kit,"The kit is basically easy to use and you can get started without having to read too many instructions. It takes up a lot of memory. I've used it for a couple of projects and they've come out fairly professionaly done. The e-mail postcards are next to worthless and are basically free advertisements for Hallmark which turned me off to the whole set. If I pay for it, I don't want to become a walking billboard from some corporation.I'd recommend it to beginners. bg"
2,Hallmark Scrapbook Studio Deluxe 3.0,At first I was pleased because of the price. Then I found out that this is a very old version. That made me somewhat unhappy.I wish I had known this before I purchased it.
1,"Definetly not ""food grade""","I bought this item because I was looking for a bargain and the price tag appealed for 24 canisters. After using a half dozen chargers, I checked the inside of the dispenser with my finger and discovered a sludge-like residue smelling like machine oil and difficult to clean. I bought 2 of these 24 packs thinking I would save money but now I have to dump these in the trash. These chargers work but the quality control in the manufacturing of the canisters themselves need to improve."
4,Fantastic,"I forgot how much I enjoyed Butler's work. I found this book for sale at the used bookstore and snapped it up. W/O being cliche, I found she wrote the inner talk of the characters' well.This book had me thinking about the storyline. And, I enjoyed the way she commented on race and class issues without wagging her finger at the reader. She is by far one of the best sci-fi writers. I don't know why I took a hiatus from her work, but I'll definitely read some of her newer stuff and go back and re-read the others."
5,Great Read One of my fav. O.Butler books,I enjoyed this book very much. They way she introduced each character was like starting a new book. They each seem unrelated but all have a strong power that connects them. I highly reccomend this book.
5,OEB Fan,"If you are a fan of Ms. Butler's writings, you do not need a review to prompt you to read her works. If you are NOT a fan - pick up any one of her books and you will be transported to a world as vivid as the one you wake up to every morning! Ms. Butler's books capture your attention from the first page and keeps it there until the last word is read . . . ."
4,Good conclusion but slow at some points,"This books functions as a conclusion to Butler's series about a group of humans bred to be telepaths from the beginning of time. The story continues some previous characters and introduces several new ones sometimes too many with too little information to allow the reader to empathize successfully. This book is excellent if one is looking for strong women or ""minority"" characters in social science fiction."
5,Another five stars,"Excellent followup to Wild Seed, which was great. I recommend all of Butler's books, especially Kindred. Look her up and read her books, many of which are in a series. She is a science fiction writer for all people, who has a lovely personality."
5,Keep it coming,"When I began reading this book I didn't know it would be the catalyst of the patternmaster series. Actually, after having read several Butler books and figuring out there were series, I would just read the books according to publications dates.Mind of My Mind is a good book that explores another realm of human development. This time instead of going into extraterrestrial realms, Butler keeps everything ""grounded"" so-to-speak. The characters, as always, are intertwined in some weird relationship scheme. (Is there something in her life that has her do these polygamistic type relationships?)Buy it, read it and expand your mind."
4,Beginning of the Mildred Keith series,"This is the first in the Mildred Keith series, a companion series to the Elsie Dinsmore books. Mildred's family moves to the 'frontier' after a financial loss, and lessons learned along the way serve to strengthen their faith.Very different from the newer releases by Mission City Press, the books are not interchangeable. Still worth reading, however."
1,This tastes so gross. I would never order this again.,I had two chips and couldn't go on. I brought several bags to work and almost everyone avoided it. I ended up throwing out the whole box(12 bags).
1,Fraught with error,This series is at best misleading and at worst dangerous. There is no discernment at all in the sources chosen. Many were condemned as heretics. What is useful is so abbreviated that it is practically devoid of meaning in some cases.
4,Keep on changin',"Not too much left since the last Europe's release (Prisoners...). Mr. Tempest solo career has turned into a totally different kind of music, which doesn't means that its quality has ever gone down. Not at all.His first solo album ""A place to call home"" shows us the clue in terms of the music Joey wanted to lead. It's a great album. But this Azalea... definitely takes us to a different space. For us, who are Europe fans, it becomes a dellusion at first. But when you listen to it, you really pay attention to it, then is when you realize how a singer can improve his voice at a level unknown. Quiet music, no guitar heros around, kinda folk irish influenced (so he says). Highly recommended. Read the lyrics: they get really high standards (especially ""Lucky"", ""Dance for you"" and ""The one in the glass""). I repeat: it's not Europe so far.And...to those who expect they're back soon...it will happenTill then."
3,Only for Europe sentimental fans,"Even if it is not a bad music, you must be 1000 % a Tempest (not Europe) fan to consider it a great album. It is like loving Ringo Starr's music, just because he was a Beatle. But, one, Europe is not Beatles (they will, fortunately or not, always be remembered just for ""The Final Countdown""), two, there is nothing original in this album (3/4 of the today american bands plays this music), three, Ringo is a very original figure and even if he has never reached the success of his partners, he is still ... a Star, and finally, four, Ringo has never betrayed his fans, playing something completely different, 100 % american, far from the melt-in-the-mouth european hard-rock (the Scorpions would never do this to their fans). The three stars are alone for the last song. Please Joey, forgett about a solo career, just go back and join your old band. I think every Europe fan would thank yoy ten times more for that! An Europe come-back would really be something ..."
4,LAPD continues.,"Shah's LAPD detective heroine, Brenden Harlow, is a quick and interesting vacation read. Shah gets better, novel by novel. A bit tedious in parts, but with enough interrelated plot lines and complexity and turmoil to keep the mind moving."
2,for beginners only,I bought this book after having played the game for about a week and a half. In that week in a half I had already learned most of everything in the book. Unless you're just a total newbie to cars I wouldn't suggest buying this one. You'll do just fine diving right into the game. Most of the info is out of date and it doesnt even cover the rare cars and parts in the game which is one of the main reasons I bought it.
4,Great Matching Toy,"I use this toy for color matching. The pieces are very flexible, hold up well to play, and are not too hard to connect. The only thing that would add to the fun would be if you could put different heads and bodies together to create your own animal combinations. This doesn't work because the animals are not all facing the same way, so the heads are backward if you put them on the wrong body. It is still a great toy."
5,A Long Lost Treasure,"Being that I generally read about Custer, mountain men and the Plains Indian Wars, this was a bit of a departure. But it was so good that I read it twice in the last ten years. It is part frontier adventure, part love story, and wonderfully and realistically told. Being that the author is a woman, I was quite surprised that it wasn't overly sentimental by any means. Also, check out her book titled The Great Adventure - a brilliant mountain man novel that contains some of the same characters."
1,The Ishtar of Books,"Bought this book at a library sale. Fortunately it was only one dollar since it perhaps the worst book I have ever read. Normally a book this bad I would put down after the first chapter but I was compelled to complete it since the author is a resident of the area where I reside and could not imagine that a local would write a book this awful. To anyone considering wasting their time with this nonsense, use it for kindling."
2,Deceiving,"The only thing I can say about this book is don't buy it!Tommy Monaghan didn't deserve that. The first 4 books of the series are so good, I'd advise to stay on that good impression.This last one is messy with a lot less humour and many more casualties.Right I was deceived by Garth Ennis who made much much better than this."
5,Track Listing,1. Darkus Twisted2. Out Of Here3. Flying High4. Apology5. Roughead6. Forthcoming7. Chelsea Smile8. This Time It's Different9. Top Yourself10. Lucy Gray11. I Can Water My Plants12. Trout
4,Very pretty bike.,This was a Christmas gift for my 14 yr. old neice. She loved it and loves the color too. Good quality bike at an excellant price. Throw in free Amazon shipping and you can't beat it.
3,Good Low Budget Cartridge,"I picked this up as a replacement for one headshell and got another for backup, these are nice and loud but the needle is EXTREMELY sensitive, if you want to try out scratching I do not recommend buying these, but you need a cheap replacement/backup for regular club/party mixing these are perfect, the GT on the top gives it a pretty cool look too."
1,Rides way too low,"This cartridge rides way too low on the deck and the cartridge will scrape against the vinyl, which can easily damage the vinyl."
2,Not what I Expected,I was very disappointed with the package when it arrived. It was open and damage. I'm just glad the actually DVD still worked.
1,Another half-baked rip-off of an important group,"I'm becoming weary of these hastily-assembled, poorly selected compilations. Is this from the band's classic Columbia catalogue (that's been so shamefully neglected by Sony)? I doubt it. And why is there only 12 songs when the CD likely can hold twice as many as this? I'm continually mystified as to why this group - which single-handedly rescued Irish music from Bing Crosby and paved the way for the Dubliners, Chieftains, Wolfe Tones, etc - has been treated so shabbily. Tommy, Liam, Tom and Paddy deserve better. If you want decent Clancy cds, the best bet is In Person At Carnegie Hall and Reunion."
2,"Material great, paperback poor quality","I purchased this book for a class. The written material is exactly what I needed, but the workmanship of the paperback version is really poor. I knew I was purchasing a paperback, but I didn't expect to get so little for $100. Some pages are already falling out because the glue binding is so shotty."
5,lost inches,"I have been taking the lipotropic pills for 3 months. I have lost 10 pounds. I have lost inches in buttocks, thighs, and stomach , arms. People have commented to me that I lost alot of weight. I have been on low sugar,and limit carbohydrates to 60 grams a day, Drink lots of water. I can not take the full 6 tabs a day that the instructions call for because it makes me sleepy and tired. I take 2 in the morning and 2 in evening. They work."
2,Undecided,"I bought 2 bottles, took the 6 pills at a time with meals and did not notice any difference in anything...."
2,Not what I was looking for.....,"Hands on Algebra appears to rely heavily on Algebra tiling. That is, using tiles to demonstrate factoring, polynomial multiplication, etc. I was looking for more of a projects book. If you are looking for a book on how to use tiles in the classroom, THIS IS IT. Otherwwise, look elsewhere."
2,Who has the time?,"I have been teaching Algebra I to high school freshman for 8 years. I bought this book hoping to find some new, clever activities or games. Instead, I found a fat book all based on Algebra tiles. I do believe Algebra tiles are useful and good for laying down a strong conceptual framework, but I would never use them all year long. The students would get burned out on tiles, just as any other activity or manipulative. I can't comment on whether there are any powerful lessons in this book, I haven't had time to read through it carefully. When I need an activity, I need one quickly. I have tried referring to this book four or five times, but keep putting it back on my shelf because the activities take too long to read through and understand. Maybe during the summer I will have the time to look at it closer."
3,Nothing special here.,"This is early Trane, and is really only for collectors. Trane does an adequate job here but doesnt show any of the fire or flair that makes him stand out so later.There are a few nice ballads here, but you're better off picking up Lush Life or Soultrane if you want that type of music from this era of Trane."
2,ok for light use,"I needed chopsticks and chose this because of free fast shipping. The country where I live in does not have reusable chopsticks so I basically did not have an alernative. I have had these for 6 months. I never let them soak in water and rinse them right away. However, the laquer on these chip and fade away with repeated use - even with handwashing in a gentle, nonabrasive bioegradable soap. If you use chopsticks 3x a day and live in the USA, buy metal chopsticks that will last you for life. If you live overseas and have no other options, then you can use these until you get your hands on a nice pair."
4,Brilliant,"Godard's misunderstood film about a cell of Maoist students in 1967 France is not so much an endorsement of revolutionary politics as it is an exploration of it. Although the film clearly contributed to the revolt at Columbia uprising, and later the student May uprising of 1968, this is in fact a highly nuanced account of the variegated tendencies of radicalization among the French youth. We encounter an outdated renunciation of Marxism-Leninism, which sadly converted large swaths of radicalizing youths to Mao in the 1960's, and still has some resonance on the left today. This is a delightful mixture of politics and pop culture as only Godard can provide, that is, with passion and form."
3,Where's the End Title,"Great movie. Decent,not exceptional transfer. Nice extras. However, where is the end title to the film that Richard Brody mention in his new Godard biography. After the shutters are closed their should be an end title that reads ""The End Of A Beginning."" It has gone missing. This is why Koch Lorber is not Criterion. Can any of you Godard experts out there help with this? Thanks."
2,Dreamgirls,the key in which the songs were in was not posted in the description. The quality of the tracks were great except for he fact that there was not possibility of selecting a higher or lower key for the songs.
2,software bug and poor technical support,"This device worked with most, but not all, presentations that I converted on a Windows 2000 PC. The conversion software does not provide any error messages so problems are impossible to debug. Technical support by phone was nonexistent and not much better by email."
2,software bug and poor technical support,"This device worked with most, but not all, presentations that I converted on a Windows 2000 PC. The conversion software does not provide any error messages so problems are impossible to debug. Technical support by phone was nonexistant and not much better by email."
4,Great except for packaging and one bolt,"Similar to the other reviewer who mentioned the bad packaging, my hitch receiver arrived with two big holes on either side of the box and no extra padding to protect the receiver. Looks like it shipped in the manufacturer's box; it was not over-boxed by Amazon. The receiver itself fit my 2002 Jeep Liberty perfectly. The only challenge was getting one bolt secured because the threaded hole was right behind the exhaust pipe, so a thick socket wrench would not fit in the gap and I had to use a traditional wrench. It took about 20-30 minutes to make painstaking 1/4 turns at a time with the wrench. Other than these issues, the receiver looks great and feels very durable."
5,FITS PERFECT!,Just as others have said. Fits perfect. Had it installed in 15 minutes! Great deal and quality part! I would purchase again in a heartbeat.
4,Sparkling wheel,"Ok , who reviews a sparkling wheel ? I'll tell you, these toys go way back and they are hard to find. The ones I bought are very well made. Here's the trick. For some reason infants and small children are mesmerized by these wheels. About 30 years ago I had my infant daughter on a flight Boston to Miami. She was screaming and I felt terrible. AnElderly gentleman came over ang gave me one of these sparkling wheels. She quickly became enthralled. He told me he carries several on every flight. so since then I do the same. They work! Saved me listening to crying kids on many flights."
5,Call Centers for Dummies,"This is an excellent, comprehensive overview of call centers, including specific metrics to be tracked and measured. Call center locations, set up and on-going operations are also covered."
3,Historical Document .....,"I am a long time fan of the band, and just got this CD to be complete with Talk Talk in the music library. (Thanks to the previous reviewer here of this item). Initially this is a let-down because there's not much new at all. The instrumental B-side 'Stump' is interesting, and if not totally then just less than .... original. The B-side ""5:09' is a composite of instrumental parts from 'Taphead' and 'New Grass' with part of the long dual-sax solo from Laughing Stock's 'After the Flood' spliced-in with dubiously successful mix-editing. Three tracks here are virtually just as they are on Laughing Stock. The rest display a rougher sense for composition. Well, listening to this may grow on me. But besides the concept of this being an assembly - I suppose due to lack of any liner notes on this CD issue - of the (3) Polydor singles as they originally appeared a decade before, this CD barely holds itself together."
4,It is heavy and kind of manly,"It is not a pretty watch for women, and it is kind of heavy (but I heard heavier watch means well-made watch). I own this watch for more than 4 years already (yes, I am a late reviewer), and it still works great! I mean, the leather was worn out and needs to be replaced, but the watch itself is still very accurate. I tested this watch when I went to the ocean, and the salt water didn't kill it. I sometimes wear it when I was in a shower, and nothing happened yet. Overall, it is a good watch if you cares about its function more than the style."
5,Remarkable Concepts And New Ideas,"This is a time travel story with a difference. It is interesting and funny. A remarkable novel of considerable entertainment value. Mr Joyce's sence of humor is distinctly warped. My only complaint is that the book is a little on the short side. Even so, this is one for the serious collector as I can see a bright future for this author. The story really rolls. Never a dull moment. Would make an excellent movie. I wish the author luck, but hope that his next book is a bit longer."
1,Okay...this is weird.,"I bought ""The Secret"" from Amazon and am very pleased with that. I enjoyed Dr. Proctor a lot on that so I thought I would give this a try to lose weight.Dr. Proctor barely speaks on this audio CD. I was not very inspired.This CD is mostly Michele singing the same song over and over again. Perhaps one is supposed to be dancing during this whole thing--I guess that would work to lose weight. But then we all know that that is one of the things we are supposed to do. Fat people aren't dumb--they're just fat.I actually fell asleep because the one song is so monotonous. Perhaps it's suppose to work sublimally while asleep.I don't understand why anyone would give this 5 stars. I would love to talk to them and ask them if they lost weight and why they gave this product 5 stars.I'm sending this back."
3,great content - bad recording,"I hate to give this product a bad review. The content is great, but the recording quality is horrible. I have ordered this from two different vendors and also from another website. The recording is scratchy and skips around."
3,It made me laugh which is a good start. to positive thinking.,"While this CD may not be for everyone I can absolutely see it being helpful for others in their quest to manifest perfect weight. I really admire and respect Bob Proctor and his message, although short, is a good one that really sticks with you. Definitely food for thought, as it creates a positive image to hold in both the subconscious and conscious mind. The music is infectious because as silly as it might seem at first, you end up singing it to yourself long after you've stopped listening to the CD. Honestly, I feel it's worth a try for anyone who has the desire to BE their perfect weight."
5,Came university mathematics professor recommended,"As suggested by my cousin who is a mathematics professor, I began my daughter on this curriculum. It is simple yet effective. Concepts come easy and lessons are just the right length. Looking forward to continuing her on this curriculum in future years of home schooling."
3,More of the sword-and-sorcerous duo!,"The sequel to FROSTFLOWER AND THORN, opens with a young sorcerer, Windbourne, locked up for murder! Because of her friendship with the sorceress Frostflower, the warrior woman Thorn knows that there's no way a sorceron could commit such a crime, for to commit violence upon another living being causes the sorcerers to lose their power! She takes it upon herself to spring him from the clink and, with the help of Frostflower, the trio set out to clear Windbourne's name. Their new companion, however, is rather sanctimonious and repressed, so when he's not preaching or being holier-than-thou, he's agonising over the dirty dreams he keeps having! Once again, Thorn outlaws herself for another blasted sorceron, and once again, the two friends set out for adventure in the Tanglelands!"
4,Comanche Moon,As a big fan of Lonesome Dove I was pleasantly surprised at the production and direction of this TV Movie. As always with the writing of Larry McMurty its dialogue is always a pleasure to listen to. The use of subtitles for the Commance language makes for more realistic characterisations of the native americans. How the actors coped with this problem I do not know but it works. The location filming made it a pleasure to watch on a large plasma screen. Lennie Niehaus's score was up to his usual high standard. Highly recommended.
5,Comanche Moon DVD,"Really quick shipping made for a quick viewing of the Comanche Moon segment of the Lonesome Dove Saga. If you like Lonesome Dove, you will like this."
3,The Lonesome Dove Saga continues with Comanche Moon,I was not too impressed with Comanche Moon because of the actors portraying Gus and Captn. Call. I'm was spoiledby the outstanding acting of Duval and Jones in Lonesome Dove.I do love this whole story though and had to see Comanche Moon to get the years in between Dead Man's Walk andLonesome Dove. Comanche Moon was just ok for me. But you do need to see it so you get the complete story.
1,THIS WAS REALLY BAD,I watched this with my dad and we both came to an agreement; this was terrible. I felt like I wasted 3 days waiting for something to happen that would grasp my attention. Nothing did!What the hell was the point of this besides wasting my time?This shouldn't be bought--it should be given away for free.
1,commache moon,I haven't received the dvd as of yet. they said it would take about three weeks. Maybe the shipper needs a reminder. Thanks Clarice Dooley
1,this movie sucks,This is a worthless pice of junk-makes no sences!This is not a family movie - is not for anyone with good taste
2,a Characiture of the origninal,The story is a prequal to the original story and helps set the stage but is only average in acting and production. It looks like a staged mini series with a somewhat concocted story. As part of the series its worth owning and watching but only once unlike the original which you can watch repeatedly and be rewarded.
1,A Bad western movie!,"The acting and dialogue are bad. The film is slow and boring. The are no ""fighting scenes"" in the whole movies. What I mean is that in all those scenes, only one side was shooting at the other for a couple of minutes. Then it ended.Save your money on this."
4,Part of Lonesome Dove,"We got this as a completion to our Lonesome Dove series. It kinda fills in the gaps of who and how things came about. Unfortuately, hollywood again has put a sex crazed woman in it to make it inappropiate for children."
4,And Then There Was Lonesome Dove,Larry McMurtry's prequel is not the instant classic Lonesome Dove was but this adaption of his novel is still worthwhile. Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are credible as McCrae and Call while Val Kilmer gives a bravura performance as the eccentric Captain Scull. The supporting cast all do well especially Wes Studi as the Commanche Chief Buffalo Hump. Filmed in Widescreen HD and with high production standards this should please most Western fans.
4,Comanche Moon,Good video. It helps tie into the other DVDs in the series. Well worth purchasing. (Help! I've become a Lonesome Dove Junkie!)
4,Comanche Moon does not disappoint Lonesome Dove fans,"I really enjoyed this movie for 2 reasonsFirst-KArl Urban is quickly becoming my favorite actorSecond-I am a HUGE Lonesome Dove fanIf you followed Lonesome Dove closely and wondered about the back stories of any of the beautifully written characters, then Comanche Moon will answer most of those questions. It doe sa very good job of giving you the back story on Call and McCrae as well as several other great characters that we love from Lonesome DoveI would not recommend watching Comanche Moon before you watch Lonesome Dove though. I am not sure I would've enjoyed it so much if I had not seen LD.overall i think it's a great movie -and I was plesantly surprised with Steve Zahn(sp?)"
2,Comanche Moon,"This is a totally different version of Lonesome Dove but, is definitely not a second chapter to the original movie."
4,Continuing teh Lonesome Dove story,DVDs arrived in good condition. This is the continuation of the Lonesome Dove story. It's entertaining and worthwhile if you enjoyed Loinesome Dove.
4,Good series.,It's fun to see the Lonesome Dove characters when they are young and their stories are just starting out. You find out why they go to Lonesome Dove. The cast in this movie does a really great job. All of them very believable in their rolls.We really enjoyed it.
5,Commache Moon-DVD,"Excellent! Follows the story line of the book, with a few deviations. Good finish to the rest of the collection, which I have."
3,Not particularily user friendly,"I bought this unit from Best Buy. It froze after about two weeks so I returned it for servicing. It came back ""nothing wrong with it, consult the manual for instructions as to how to operate it"". I still cannot turn it off manually although it does turn off with the remote. It seems slow to program and to respond. The picture is good on both VCR and DVD. It does not take up much space which is its main attraction. Given sufficient space I think it much better to have two units that operate independently of each other."
2,I am returning this model..,When you load a tape in the VCR part the tape gets stuck and it feels and looks like the unit will break. 300 bucks is a lot of money for something with such a poor design.
1,bad quality,"It was a OK price, but bad quality. After I used it for about 2 weeks, the tray of the DVD player stopped working! Glad Amazon refunded my money."
3,Disappointing - Many DVD's skip or freeze,"We bought ours a couple of years ago when it was the only affordable DVD-VHS combo at our local electronics store. Almost immediately we noticed that some DVDs would have trouble playing. Having nothing else to play them on, we assumed that it was the disks. We even took some DVD's back to the store and exchanged them as damaged. Since then we've found that disks that wouldn't play on the Samsung will play other people's machines without any trouble. Running a head cleaner doesn't make any difference. We're looking for something new, now, and trying not to make the same mistake.When it works, which is most of the time, it's great. But when it DOES act up, it really ruins the evening."
1,Disappointed in Samsung,"Want to watch a movie but don't have time to watch it all at once? Don't buy a Samsung DVD player unless you don't mind leaving the unit on all the time! Turning this player off and back on starts the disc back up at the beginning, forcing you to relocate your spot in the movie."
2,"Great idea, poor delivery!","I thought this would be a great deal, and for some video users it is. However, the videophile that I am requires some advanced functions like frame advance and slow motion in reverse as well as forward. The VHS quality was not very good. Slow motion and fast forward were very poor quality. The DVD and VCR both play well as long as all you want to do is watch the movie (or TV show) from beginning to end! Get this, to fast forward in DVD you have to press AND HOLD the FF key. Real hard to get used to.If you just want to watch videos, not bad, but give me the real stuff!!"
2,good DVD player,"The DVD player works great, and the VCR did for about a year. Now our kids get frusterated because they can't watch some of their favorite tapes. There is no sound, and the picture is ""staticky"". Tried using a head cleaner several times, and still doesn't work"
2,Samsung DVD-V1000,"If this DVD player worked as advertised it would be a great unit and I do like the space savings aspect.The main problem I have is that the DVD player has difficulty accessing menus on some DVDs. It displays the menus wrong and won't allow selection of some items.Another annoyance seems to be with the actual decoding of the DVD during playback. Usually during the course of a movie there will be one or more glitches, which amount to a slight pause or skip. Sometimes the video appears scrambled momentarily.Worst of all, the unit I have seems to hang up or get into a mode where it doesn't respond to any buttons (even the power switch). To correct this problem I have to unplug it from the wall outlet to cycle power. (Really inconvenient!)"
1,Poor Quality,"Great concept to combine the DVD and VCR. It worked great the first three or four times, but then the power button and remote quit working."
2,Worked well for a year,"I bought this unit to replace a VCR in our bedroom. Worked well for just over one year, before the tape loading mechanism failed. The local electronics shop could not fix it, and recommended sending it to the manufacturer for service. Of course, it was out of warranty by six weeks! Never did get it fixed. The good news is that our credit card company had an extended warranty program, that doubled the manufacturers original warranty. They just sent us a check for the full purchase price! Time to shop for something new.Remote is a bit complicated to use, not very intuitive. Picture and sound quality were okay. Given my experience with this product, I'd be hesitant to buy from them again."
1,"poor quality, cheaply made","I bought this because with a replay box, a satellite receiver and a vcr I was worried about being able to wire yet another box intomy TV which doesn't have infinite inputs.I have only had it a week and we will be returning it.I have owned VCRs for years and this is the first one Ihave had that tapes get stuck in.In addition my children who have been putting tapes into mySony VCR for years have a lot of difficulty getting the tapein here. If they try and insert the tape backwards (I know)instead of not letting it go in, the tape goes part way in and gets wedged and won't eject.Obviously you shouldn't put a tape in backwards but a unit shoulddeal with a common error in some way that doesn't require a tripto the repair shop.Technical support from Samsung was useless.I read all the reviews on Amazon and decided to take a chance.Now I am sorry that I did.Skip this product which is not cheap and get something better made and more robustly designed"
2,I do not like it.,I do not like it. It is only for information but you can not pass your oral and practical with this book.
5,Exactly what I need!,"As I am going to take the Powerplant part of my A&P test soon, I really needed this book to see what I would be expected to do. While some of the information is available from the FAA website, this book is so much easier to read and understand. GREAT BOOK!"
4,Discretion advised,To amazon's web-site that is. The packaging was discrete; what would my doormen think?
2,how do you play!!!!,i got this game 2 yaers ago from a school catalog and i still dont know how to play. i feel bad for making my mom pay for a lousy game that i cant play right. dont waste your moms money. even though its 1 dollar!
1,You should shut up,"Very disappointing; not really a self help book. The author spends much of his time talking about his celebrity contacts, and that offer no real insight in the cause and effect relationship between his concepts and their problems. What really, is his concept. I could solve most of my problems by not talking, humm a novel idea."
5,Great tool to reclaim your sanity,"This book reaffirms what we all know but have forgotten: We really do have the tools to make wise decisions, do what's best for ourselves, and trust who we are. What an inspiring message packed in a tiny and easy-to-read format. Reading this book is a treat--it's one I'll be re-reading soon."
3,Good TV show SPORTs show - Ode to Joe Tees-mon and Mike Adamle,"Thiesmann played 15 years in the CFL/NFL and Mike Adamle was behind on thedepth chart; Walt Payton in Chicago,John Riggins in New York (J's) andEd Podolak with the Kansas City Chiefs.Larry Csonka, the greatest FB in ProFootball History later replace Joe T."
2,"Worked well, sometimes...","I really liked this little thing, most of the time. For no reason I could identify, however, it began to ""echo"" most irritatingly on some calls. Sometimes I could hear the echo, other times I couldn't but the person I was talking to would complain, so I had to switch it off or call them back. I was going to take it to someone who could figure out what was going on, but my Schnauzer chewed it up!! No, I'm not kidding. With the problems I had with that dizzying echo, I decided not to replace it with the same item."
4,The lucky grain of corn,This book is no good for those unfamiliar with the Bengali alphabet but it is good for those wanting to learn sentence structures etc in a fun way.
3,Elite Fuzzy Logic Rice Cooker,"This seems to be an adequate rice cooker. However, the manual is quite unclear and inadequate. It doesn't specify that the rice cooker will shut off automatically when the water is used up from the cooking process. I had to call customer service. They didn't know how to use it either. Once I figured it out, the rice was fine. I use brown rice, so it took all of the 55 minutes allotted for rice. It would be nice if this had a timer to allow a little more time for wild rice."
5,Great value for a fuzzy logic rice cooker,"I am quite happy with my rice cooker and cannot understand what trouble a different reviewer had - I hope they knew that rice is measured in Japanese cups and that the cooker has a max capacity of 8 Japanese cups.The rice cooker is well made, looks good and works great. You add rice and water (water and rice ratio for white rice is 1:1 to 1:1.5) hit start and about 20 minutes later the unit beeps and switches to warming only (the unit initially assumes 55 minutes for the rice program, but turns off when done). The manual is a bit weird, but the operation is pretty straight forward. The pot has an anti-stick coating (brand name Teflon, with sticker and all!) and is easily removed from the cooker for cleaning. The cooker also comes with a rice spoon, rice measuring cup and a steaming basket."
1,Amazon experience negative; retailer experience very positive,"Amazon had the product listed incorrectly so it appeared as a Sudoku game. When I received it, I realized it was not what it was advertized under. This is when the retailer stepped in and replaced the product with a good Sudoku game at no extra cost. Great retailer, but will not trust Amazon advertizing again. Also there is no way to contact Amazon directly with issues like this."
1,Naimark on Patents,Every engineer and scientist should have a fundamental understanding of patents. I got mine from this book in the 1960's but it is now far too out of date to be relied on for anything but the grossest idea of the basic process of protecting intellectual property and the application process. A first time reader should obtain a book that is recently published
4,Great!,"""Trash Can"" is a non-album track only found on this CD-Single. ""Reason is Treason"" is actually a different version/remix of the album version, and in my opinion, is better.The videos are cool too."
3,Old Sesame Street,"These DVD's are of old Sesame Street and my son was not interested in the ""learning about letters"" or ""the great numbers game"" videos. My son loves elmo and sesame street but for some reason these just do not keep his attention."
5,Just a very beautiful book...,"If you look for Disney history, it is a must.If you look for animation resources, this is a must.If you look for a well-made book, this is a must.Great on the coffee table, on any shelf, and even better, in front of you...All this goes for Lambert's Mickey Mouse and Blanche Neige (Snowwhite) books, as well! Get them, and hope he makes some more..."
4,Another Great Textbook,"Absolutely loved this textbook. Although the layout is extremely simple, maybe even bland, the content is fantastic. Great selection of stories that will spark classroom conversation and debate on many different topics. As I have said before about other textbooks, most, if not all of the content in this book is available online, but the idea is to get it all into a book for classroom use."
3,"Good Book, But Better Bought at a Used (less than 10 dollar) Price","I needed this book for my English Class, and for the short time I used it, it was sort of helpful.Be sure that your teacher will read more than three stories from this, otherwise its a waste of money if you spend more than ten dollars. You can find many of these stories online, and print them off rather than being this entire (fairly large) book.The price is rather inflated as you can tell by the trade-in price."
5,Intense Moisturizer,"Really great product for very dry hair. Works especially well if you leave product on hair for thirty minutes, cover hair with plastic shower cap with product in hair while sitting under the dryer.Rinse product out with cool to luke warm water not hot then blow dry and style as usual.Excellent product for dry and or damaged hair puts moisture back in hair."
4,Any opinion on other Mizani conditioners to mix with protein,So I just purchased the Affirm 5 in 1 Reconstructor for my daughter who has a relaxer and her hair sheds quite a bit and she has some breakage. From the reviews this seems like just the thing I need. It also sounds like I could be mixing this with the 5 in 1. I have the Humecto Conditioner now. Does anyone know if that will work just the same?
5,Excellent guide,"Found this an awesome guide to living a better life. I had shied away from Doreen's work because I thought it might nBe too ""out there"", but I have read several of her books now and have learned from them all. This is the best so far."
4,The Lightworkers Way -Doreen Virture,This is a very down to earth book and I am sure most of you will see a side of yourself in the pages. You will really see the human side of Doreen Virtue and all the struggles she went through...(just like most of us) and be able to relate to her. A very good Read.
1,Occult In Disguise,This is nothing more than occult and devil worship disguised to look pretty. There is only ONE true GOD and He certainly isn't Doreen Virtue. Following this woman only guarantees that you will be misguided.
4,i like it,I am still reading this book...because of time constraints but so far so good I am really learning a lot but then again I am a big fan of Doreen Virtue work.
4,Doreen is always a pleasure to read,This book is for beginners and a great review for seasoned lightworkers. A very nice read for those interested reconnecting with their higher guidance and sharing it with the world.
5,I enjoyed this book,"As the author ofThe Second Virgin Birth, I enjoyed The Lightworkers Way. I found it different and interesting."
5,The Lightworkers Way,I received the book well before the date promised. Am happy to add another Doreen Virtue book to my book collection.
4,Love this book!,I received this book in the condition describe. I love this book and would recommend it to anyone seeking info on the metaphysical.
5,This Book Describes who I am - I now have a title.,"After reading many many hundreds of books when my spiritual journey began, this one made me feel like I made it home. This is me, this is my life and what I'm supposed to do. There is a name for people like me, not just a psychic or healer but Lightworker and it sums everything up perfectly! I love a good book that I can't put down until I've read it cover to cover. This one has been with me for 10+ years, highly recommend. Rhea[....]"
4,Another Alamo to Forget,To top it off - the Texans win the battle of the Alamo in the video game.Despite the History Channel logo on the box there is no history in this video game. The Alamo backdrop could just as easily have zergs from StarCraft fighting Davy Crocket.ALSO: the game is buggy and the controls are terrible.The game does sell for a discounted price of 20 bucks but if you are an alamo fan save your money.
1,Terrible,"I've enjoyed other History Channel battle simulations, but this one is just terrible. Poor controls, no history, and pointless game play. This should have been called ""History Channel: Rebuild Some Adobe Walls."" Give this one a pass."
4,"""Show me your bookcollection....""","I agree with the other reviewer of this book, that it is definitely only for the hardcore Lovecraft-fan! But if you, like me, have read and reread the masters tales, then this bibliography of his bookcollection makes for fascinating reading!It gives us a hint on where Lovecraft got his inspiration, but also a better look at who this man was! Theres an old saying that goes like ""show me your bookcollection, and I will tell you who you are!"". This is definetely true for this book!"
4,Great action-packed novel!,"I enjoyed reading this book more than other books I have read. It was very similar to the movie, which in a way was a good thing. I like how they added lots of comedy twists with the story. The only thing that stopped me from giving this 5 stars is how it was written. I don't like how they broke the chapters up into who was telling the story. It would have been a lot easier to read if the story was told in just one point of view. I would recommend anyone to read this book."
4,TOTALLY CAPTIVATING,"Believe me once you pick the book up, you can't possible put it down. It took me only 1 day and a half to finish this hard-hitting book. It makes you want to see the movie just to see if the events from the book are in there.For those who know absolutely nothing about this book or plot, let me fill you a little bit. Mr. and Mrs. Smith are world-class, head-strong deadly assassins, and in the midst of them meeting each other and getting married, they keep this secret totally hidden. Well, until now. You see they were sent after the same target and in the mix of it all, they start to attack each other. SO pretty much, they find out that the person that tried to kill them was there lover and the whole novel is them pretty much trying to settle the dispute.I hope this was helpful, and happy reading--REMEMBER THE MOVIE COMES OUT JUNE 10, 2005!"
1,boring,"One of the most boring ,dull concerts I ever seen.Don't get fooled by claim that is such a wonderfull one.Its not"
3,rekearning indigenous wisdom.,A giood story told in clumsy style an amateur would use. indigenous rises is somethinig i like.and i have never done a review before. i don't mind helping amazon. that's an interesting fact. though amazon can be a bad employer.
1,"Bizarre, interesting, and disturbing book","If you're reading this book purely for fiction, don't read this review as it may be a spoiler to the plot. If you're reading it because you are interested in Indians, or traditional ways, don't read it. If you're interested in new-age jigsaw puzzle spiritual development, this book is just for you!Very interesting read about the development of a spiritual path of a psychologist. Jesus as a snake was trippy. Karma, reincarnation and psychodelic drugs in the context of ceromony, not so much. The idea that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were karmicly linked to the sacrifice of the Japanese people because of a ceremony done to get revenge on Cortez at al., over what happened in Mexico, that also led to the development of the A bomb in New Mexico and Navajo code talkers being the ones who gave the instructions - I wouldn't call this ground-breaking postcolonial literature, although it's very interesting."
5,It was an excellent read!,"Someone recommended this book to me. I bought it and wasn't really interested in mystery/romance. Needless to say--I couldn't put it down!! It keeps you on the edge of your seat, eager to turn the page and read on. You think you have finally figured out the mystery and it takes another turn. And the ending wasn't at all what was expected!!"
3,Didn't quite deliver,"I thought the book's premise was interesting and had much potential, however in my opinion the story just kept getting farther and farther ""out there"". It seemed even the author couldn't dedide where to go with the story."
2,Terrible....its inconsistency made me laugh at least..,"After reading this book, I found how admirable famous writers such as the late Agatha Christie, John Chrisham or Michael Crichton are. The tricks created by the author are clich?, and the characters are so typical. Sometimes the characters?words and behaviors are not consistent (i.e. David's conversation with ex-midwife and answer to Melanie a few pages later, and David's whimsical physical status at the motel in Texas). I wonder how this book could be published without correction by some professionals (such as editors)."
1,A completely ridiculous book.,"The plot was absolutely absurd. I agree with Antioch, the love story was insipid and totally cliche. I cannot - in good conscience - recommend this book to anyone over the age of 12."
2,Didn't Tie Up Ending,"Don't read this if you worry about a spoiler. First of all, great story, but the way she tied it up was plain stupid. First of all, the son is the son of the killer? They tell you that and never tell you how or why they adopted him. Second, Meagan was gone for 4 years. Where the hell was she? Stupid. Don't waste your money on these books."
2,It could've been better,"I must say that Lisa Gardner is definetly one of those authors who fall into the category of either very hot or very cold. The first book I read, The Perfect Husband, was nothing short of never ending suspense with a believable plot. On the contrary,The Other Daughter fell way short. This book went on for way longer than it should have, and the ending was not only disappointing, but completely unbelievable. I understand it is a fiction novel, but still...she could've done better. On the bright side, the book did have some interesting and exciting areas, but they were too few and far between,except for the last few chapters of the book where everything seemed to be happening at once. I would not say this book was a total loss, but after seeing what Ms Gardner is capable of with her previous writings, I found this one to be a little disappointing."
1,So disappointed!,"After reading The Perfect Husband I was excited to have found a new 'favorite' author ... but I couldn't even finish this ridiculous book (The Other Daughter), had to put it down half way through, what a waste of time."
2,Couldn't get into it,"After reading crime novels by Lehane, Pottinger and even the odd Evanovich, this offering from Lisa Gardner was not worth reading. The characters don't have a life of their own, they are I found them boring & the plot was too unbelievable to mention. The story has far too many unexplained events & Lisa doesn't bother to explain major storylines - like Melanie's memory loss etc .If you are after a good crime novel that will leave you reeling afterwards, try something from Dennis Lehane or Stanley Pottinger. But leave The Other Daughter on the bookshelf & save your money!"
1,It's taken me a month but I'm finally done!!,"I bought this book to read on a plane journey. It was so corny, cliched, and implausible I decided to stare through the window at the clouds and nothingness outside. Since then, I've picked this dud up several times in an attempt to finish it, but always threw it on the floor in disgust. It's a guaranteed coma inducer. I used it as a sleep aid almost every night. Two pages and I was a goner! Thanks, Ms Gardner, for more than a month of speedy nod-offs."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book primarily because of the high marks it received from other readers. I was bored with it almost from the beginning but stuck with it to see how the author would tie up the loose ends. I was very disappointed. There were so many things just did not sit right with me. And I would be very interested to know what drug is available out there that would cause such permanent and severe memory loss, if such a drug exists. So needless to say, I do not recommend this book to other readers."
3,Predictable,"It was interesting reading, even though I had figured out the plot long before the end. I was surprised because usually Lisa Gardner (whom I love) is better at disquising the bad guys."
4,Classic Gardner,"Great book! Classic Lisa Gardner ""Who done it"". The book kept me guess until the end - not only was I trying to figure out who the bad guy was but it took me awhile to figure out what they did. Great read."
2,Absurdity!,"This is the third Lisa Gardner book I've read. The others were so so but this one is a ""woofer"". The plot is totally implausable. All these disfunctional people, (an adulterous alcholic, a womanizer, a homosexual, a physically impared FBI agent, an amnesiac, several of these are also criminals, multiple liars, and thieves, conpeople with multiple idenities all in the same little group) have a secret that they keep for twenty years? Two people can't keep a secret for any time at all! There is amnesia that is never explained. A child disappears (killed, but not), reappears after five years and no one realizes it is the same person. Everyone is sneaking around with their crippling disfunctions, both physical and emotional. I got to the last four pages and just threw the book down thoroughly disgusted that I had forced myself to keep reading hoping for some resolution that would make sense. This one is a real dog."
1,Avoidable,"I gave up the book about a third of the way in. The language feels contrived, the plot full of glaring loopholes and the characters make me clutch my hair in grief and want to yell, ""Can't you think??!"""
3,"Suspensful....but definintely not ""sheer terror""","It was an addictive book...but I was continuously looking for the ""sheer terror""...never found it. The romance was the best part. I never belived the serial killer was still alive, never once was ""affraid"". The ending surprised me a little, but not a whole lot. I really think this book lacked real talent. But, if you want a a plain ole mystery with a little romance...this is the book you are looking for....BUT, if you are looking for ""sheer terror"", this is the last book you want."
1,the other daughter,"I was very, very, disappointed. The book was shabby, filthy, the pages had bits of food or other debris on them. It was disgusting and I had to read the book with thin rubber gloves on."
5,Truly Unbelivable,"For anyone who has ever wanted to read a book that keeps you engrossed and hanging on every turn of the page. There can only be one thing to say about THE OTHER DAUGHTER...""You get what you deserve"""
1,The Other Daughter,"Even for a fictional piece this book was totally unbelievable. Stupid. Author never did explain the motives behind the acts, or how Melanie lost nine years of memory. I've read much better. A real disappointment."
3,"Great beginning, disappointing endnig","I loved the first half of this book, it was a real page turner, but unfortunately it went on way too long and the plot rather than thickening got messy. This was the first book I have read of hers but will try again hopefully with a cleaner ending."
4,Not her best but good,"I love Lisa Gardner and while this story wasn't her best (that would be The Neighbor, IMO) it was good. Lots of twists, and while there were a few things that were never explained, the ending was great, a total surprise to me. And her characters were as interesting as always."
4,Really good read,"page turner. very surprising ending. I can usually figure out who's behind the mystery, and this one really kept me guessing."
4,THE OTHER SISTER,"The book was very good, with lots of twists and turns. I enjoy Lisa's writing and look forward to her other books."
3,"Good plot, but ...","I, too, bought this book based on the many positive reviews and was hoping for a gripping suspense novel. While the plot was okay, with many twists and turns, I found parts of it hard to believe. The love story seemed to have been added as an afterthought and made me laugh at times.I was able to guess part of the solution about a hundred pages into the book, but there were still enough red herrings and surprises to keep me interested.As a non-native speaker I usually refrain from commenting on the style of writing in a book, but in ""The Other Daughter"" it seemed very plain at times.I would recommend ""The Other Daughter"" as a good read for a rainy Sunday afternoon, just don't expect too much of it. Lisa Gardner is not (yet) in the same league as Carol O'Connell, Patricia Cornwell and the likes."
3,Not as thrilled as others.,"I decided to buy this book based on the excellent review it received from the readers. However, I did not enjoy this book as much. The begining of it was interesting, but towards the end it became predictable on unenjoyable."
1,Completely ridiculous and boring,"This was the most disappointing book that I have purchased on my Kindle yet. I had previously read Love You More and enjoyed it, so I thought another book by Gardner would be a safe pick. I read the sample and didn't like it, but based on some the of the reviews I thought that it had to get better. It did not. The characters are not well-developed and the author did nothing to make me like the main character. I kept reading waiting for a great twist at the end, but instead it was stupid and unbelievable. My recommendation is to save your time and money."
2,Totally Unsurprised,"This is the first book that I have read by this author. I was given the book by a co-worker and I can honestly say that I will not look for any other books by this author. I had figured out the ending at least half way into the book. It seemed so obvious and a federal agent just believing what other people have told him and not thinking of other possibilities?Also, why was the amnesia never explained? That was the only reason I kept reading. Total disappointment."
4,The Other Daughter,"This was an intriguing, suspenseful novel that was hard to put down. It was easy to relate to Melanie's distrust and fear about her family, and I was glad to see her find a friend in David Riggs. Their romance felt contrived and forced, however, partly because of the short time they knew each other, and partly because she was so angry with him most of the time. The ending was done well, and Ms. Gardner did a fantastic job tying in all the characters as suspects. While I can't say I was surprised by the identity of Meagan's killer, I was surprised by who WASN'T involved. Perhaps the biggest (and best!) surprise was the revelation of Russell Lee Holmes' child."
2,Total let down from my fave author...,"Lisa Gardner is hands down my favorite author - I've read everything she's written and have her new book on hold for it's March release! That being said, this is the first book by her that I read and at the end was thinking: Seriously? It had so much potential but the ending, honestly, stunk! It wasnt even remotely believable and it did seem to kind of drag on through the middle. There were so many potential twists that seemed to be set up, but never came into light. I'm having a hard time reviewing without giving away key plot points (this is my first review!) I would HIGHLY recommend literally every other book by Lisa Gardner, this one, I would skip..."
2,"Okay, Lisa...you had me on ""who done it"" but to get there...","The reason I couldn't figure out ""who done it"" was there were no ""real"" clues or facts. Too many twists that when reviewed left me saying, ""WHAT?"" The scene at the end, when Harper shows his true colors was too bizarre...especially when I was trying to trust Melanie's judge of character...which is obviously very, very poor...does this mean that David will turn out to be a wife-beater? PLUS you never explained her loss of memory! How? Why? Huh?"
2,Not A Great Read,"Her first book, The Perfect Husband, was awesome but I have to say that this book was a let down. I just couldn't get into it and thought it too drawn out."
5,best book ever,"a story that has a lot of twists and turns, to keep you reading till the end, and you want more.an easy read.Ronda Moore"
4,"Great plot turns, not sure all were explained, but it definately had me hooked!","I believe this may have been Ms. Gardner's first book, and I think the writing a bit weaker than her other books I've read. However, the plot is rather complex, which keeps me wanted to know what really happened. From that level, it's a huge success. My gripes are minor, very minor. Too much dialog to explain stuff. It's not very realistic dialog, but you gotta get the info somehow. Too much romance. Not unique to this book, and I'm gay, so straight people doing it just makes me turn the page.In the end, I stayed home on a Friday night to finish the damn thing. That should tell you something."
3,A suitable diversion,"The Other Daughter is a book with a feel of sheer fantasy-- the kind of story that fascinates young girls at slumber parties. The author manages to keep the reader engaged despite some loose plotting and a severe lack of plausibility. The romance never rang true and happened far too easily. The book may have been better had the romance angle been left out entirely. As the author matures, she may develop into a fine writer capable of truly gripping suspense."
3,Love the Author - A Bit Predictable,"I am truly a HUGE Lisa Gardner fan want to mention that I have read almost all of her books except 1 or 2 so I buy whatever book she writes whenever they come out without doing any research because so far I have never been disappointed until this one but only a somewhat. The story seemed to drag a bit and things were unfortunately a predictable in several spots. It wasn't difficult to figure out who Melanie was right from the first rattle out of the box. At the end, there is a mention of Harper getting the devil tattoo but there is no story that goes with it so who cares - also the romance is bland... I will definitely keep reading her books and if you are stuck in an airport this one will make the time go by but it just didn't have the strength that her other books have. I pulled this one out of the archives as I had skipped it in the line-up and the books written after this were AMAZING so I will not worry too much about one little story..."
3,My Least Favorite by Lisa Gardner,"I don't think that Lisa Gardner could write a bad book if she wanted to, but, having said that, this was, BY FAR, my least favorite of all of her books that I've read. The twist at the end was very good, I didn't see that coming, so on that hand, the ending lived up to my expectations. As for the rest of the book, it just wasn't written that well. The characters weren't as rich as I have come to know Lisa Gardner's characters to be, the writing did not flow effortlessly, as her more current writing does, and the comedic timing that I've come to greatly appreciate from Lisa Gardner's books was also lacking, totally and completely.This wasn't a terrible book, but by no means was it great. I'm glad this was not my first Lisa Gardner book. Let's just say that she has certainly honed her craft since writing this book."
3,Quick read. Kept me interested.,"First time reading this author. I was originally looking at the top 2012 lists of books. An advertisement for ""Catch Me "" caught my eye. I figured I'd try something else by the author first. ""The Other Daughter"" was it. It kept my attention, it was filled with the suspense of who did it, and my intent of ""take me away from my life"" was fulfilled. I read these sorts of books, but also try to challenge myself as well. It's a good quick read that can keep you interested but not frustrated at having to remember a lot of character details. Now on to ""Catch Me"""
3,Better than The Perfect Husband,"While not a great story in my opinion, it was far better than Gardner's previous tale. I will admit that I originally gave up about half way through. I put the book away, read 2 or 3 other books by other authors then decided to come back to it.I saw the ending coming a mile away. The connection between the original killer and some other characters was as plain as the nose on your face. If you don't see it coming, are you really reading the story?I've heard the rest of her books are better than this. I hope so. So far I'm not impressed with Gardner."
3,Good but not great,I just finished this book. I don't think it is as good as her first book. It takes a while to get into it. It got better and the last 100 pages or so were better. I like the suspense and the carry over of past characters from Perfect Husband. This is unique to those who have read both books. I am looking forward to her next book in any event.
1,Wher's the Vermouth,Product was vinegary. I had expected the olives to be similar to the Tipsy Onions. Both are labeled as having vermouth and the onions had a sweet soury taste. Seems to me that both products should have about the same level of overall taste in ones mouth.
5,"""Toothbrushhead"" A Heartwarming Tale of Redemption!","This classic CD by Momus tells the story of Timmy, a boy mocked by his schoolmates as ""Toothbrushhead"" due to an unfortunate birth defect. Accompanied only by his dog Spear, Timmy visits various surreal lands, where he meets bizarre characters who teach him that it's not the shape of his head that counts, but the warmth of his heart. When Timmy returns home, it's with a renewed sense of self-worth, and love to share!This is certainly one of Momus' better offerings, and his first release that actually tells a story. Songs like ""My Dog Spear"" and ""Think Of Your Problems"" really bring the story to life, and are hummable to boot! ""Toothbrushhead"" is truly a rock opera for children of all ages."
5,5 Stars is not enough,"I agree with the previous reviewers about both sound and performance. This recording is miraculous, even in CD sound. I do not own a SACD player yet, but this disk tempts me to get one.I was a bit puzzled about Amazon's price--I bought it in a major retail store as a twoer with a factory sticker to that effect, suggesting that BMG's price is $11.99 for both disks. Even at 11.99 per disk, though, it's still a bargain."
1,Sorry!,"We need to temper the glowing reviews here. This is an old recording. It sounds like an old recording. The worst part is that is the chorus is very, very ordinary, and they sing with poor tone and a very much note-for-note style of non-legato delivery that is dull at best (aggravating more often than not). No clue why some find these ""living presence"" recordings good. Much as people may like to fool themselves, general performing standards really HAVE moved on since then, as have recording standards. Even SACD can't save this. Move on."
3,"Good coverage of Sabre system, but needs updating","This book is a great source to self teach Sabre if you have some experience in the travel industry. If not, it looks like the book would be a great text book to go along with a learning class. The simulated disk helps you practice what you've learned. Very complete coverage, but an up-to-date version is really needed here. Overall good source to learn Sabre system."
2,concise but outdated floppy,"the book is excellent for reviewing Sabre reservations system, but for almost $100, the price I paid, it was VERY disappointing to see it came with a very outdated floppy, which did not work on my computer and which did not work on three other computers (all with floppy disk capability). A DVD should be available instead. For this reason alone, I would have returned it, but I had already written on the book! Although it was expertly written for someone NEW to the Sabre system, I don't recommend it just for the floppy disk situation alone. Too expensive."
2,Really poor quality,"The zipper tore within the first two weeks of my using it, and I only used it once or twice a week. I lost one of the two zippers then, and then a few months later I lost the other one. Now it's unusable.Also, there's no zippable small pocket for things like your wallet and keys. And the U-shaped top zipper is really awkward."
1,Awful odor,"The quality of the bag is decent for what you pay. The problem lies with the odor that emanates from the bad - it is terrible! My whole car smells like the chemical used to manufacture it. I have washed the bad, twice, on hot with a fairly strong detergent; the only result: I destroyed the lining of the bag. I wouldn't purchased from this company again."
1,what the hell not even close to picture,the bag pictured is not even close to the pink sack that arrived at my house 2 min ago. this is extremely disappointing . i ordered a duffle bag. i recieved a flimsy drawstring bag. i am so upset because i have been looking for a good duffle gym bag. heres what i recived[...] i paid 25 bucks for this and the recieved item is a joke.
3,A lot smaller than I thought..,"Doesn't hold as much as I thought. Shoes will take up almost the entire bag. Seems to be well made, though. Wish it had a couple more pockets inside and/or outside."
3,A little small but does the job.,"It's a bit small, so can't really fit all of the gym stuff. You have to really pick and choose your gym items."
2,Gasoline,"I read all the other reviews and thought to myself, the smell can't be that bad. I figured that I would just leave the bag outside for a few days to air out. Well 4 weeks later, the bag still smells like gasoline. I'm sure the smell will eventually fade, but I don't want my clothes to absorb the smell so I still haven't used the bag."
3,too small,okay but too small to hold anything other than a few towels etc. The shoe compartment can only hold shoes for a small woman. Your out of luck with anything over a size 11. I can keep junk towels in it in my garage.
5,Alternative Ending,an excellent book no doubt. But you can go to robertwhitlow.com for his alternative ending. I think it is better. Would love to see what others think. Thanks
3,Not the best of Whitlow's work,"Whitlow is often compared to John Grisham and rightly so. Like Grisham, Whitlow seems to be exploring other types of writing. Unlike Grisham, Whitlow just doesn't quite bring it off. Reading Jimmy reminds the reader of several other pieces of literature, but these similarities just seem to reinforce the wandering nature of the writing. The book can't quite seem to decide where it's going. It's not as enchanting as Grisham's The Painted House. It's certainly not a modern To Kill a Mockingbird. There's a bit of Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury. There are even echoes of the Bruce Willis movie The Sixth Sense. But the overall story line just does not mesh together smoothly and is entirely too predictable especially coming from the author of The Trial and The List."
2,The Cover Tells it All,"The lack of excitement that Jimmy displays while sitting at the window is a pictorial synonym representing the lack of excitement in this book. Although it is a good story filled with a variety of emotions, it was predictable throughout. I could not believe that this slow reading book was authored by Robert Whitlow. As an avid reader, I have read all of his ""trial"" books and found them to be some of the best fictional literature. I believe if I would have started with ""Jimmy"", I might not have considered another of his wonderful novels."
5,Product received as advertised,The used book I ordered was in excellent condition as advertised and was received in a timely manner.
4,book was for younger group,The book was written for a young teen. I had a hard time with the style that the author provided.
3,"""Jimmy"" by Robert Whitlow","This book is being made into a movie. It is filming here in Concord, NC and I was recently an extra in this movie. I had never heard of this book and wanted to read it before the movie comes out.The book was listed as ""in good condition"" I expected good. I got poor. Book was well read, and that is ok but it was stained as if something had been spilled on it and allowed to run down all the pages, and it has an odor. It did arrive on time and I will read it, while using lots of hand sanitizer."
5,Legal thriller from the mind of a child,"Robert Whitlow brings Jimmy, a fourteen-year-old boy with a developmental disability, into your life and he will touch your heart and leave you changed. Mr. Whitlow has done an excellent job writing a legal thriller from the mind of a child. He has created a world where relationships and the love of God drives the story to its amazing conclusion."
4,"A beautiful, catching story","Jimmy is all about the characters. You won't find a lot of bone chilling drama or mystery here. What you'll find is a wholesome story about a boy who sees the world a bit different than you and I. I was very pleased with this book, and I would highly recommend it.I have two things where I think the book felt flat, however. First, the book is touted about a boy who sees angels. Angels (who Jimmy calls ""Watchers"") do appear in the book in various places, but I don't think the theme was developed as well as it could have. These ""Watchers"" could have been expanded upon to play a larger role in the book. Second, I think the ending is a let-down. The alternate ending on the website is a bit better than the ""official"" ending, but I still don't think either one tie up the loose ends of the book.Still, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Jimmy, and I would gladly tell anyone I know to buy this book."
4,Neat Book!,"I thought this was a neat book for SpongeBob fans like me, but the 10 buck price is a bad price for it. If it was a chapter book instead of a bunch of lists it would be worth it, but it's not a chapter book. Anyway, Patrick's lists in the book were hillarious! But some lists were a little stupid like, ""How to survive waiting in line at the movies."" STUPID. Or ""How to survive waiting to go to the bathroom."" Once again,STUPID. Or,""How to survive losing your spatula."" S-T-U-P-I-D. I recomend this book, but theres just some parts that should not have made it to the book."
4,I love this little sponge,"What can I say, I love SpongeBob. He's funny, and works on two levels, one for the kids and another for the adults. I will say that this book is only for the collector. It's moronic and rather silly, even for SpongeBob--so if you collect SpongeBob stuff, it'll look good next to your stuffed Patrick, but otherwise, skip it and pick up one of the dvds."
5,camp spongebob,Dear SPONGEBOB I watch your show ever day after school and i even buy your book you are like my favorite charater out of all like when you say im ready over and over. I like when MR.Kribs tell you not to play with those hooks and you and patrick play on them any ways andyou way going to work and you got caught by that hook and you went to the krusty krabs and his daughter was there and you had to pull offyour close GOT TO GO TALK TO YOU LATER
4,Very pretty earring/pendant set,"The items, purchased as a gift, arrived on time & in great condition. They were larger than I anticipated they would be, but were very pretty & appeared well-made.The peridot were bright & well cut. The silver was delicate-looking but not flimsy at all."
1,Not what I ordered and RIDICULOUS shipping charges,"I ordered bath confetti which came in the wrong pattern and scent. Also, by the amount of shipping costs I thought I was getting MUCH more confetti. Although it gave a weight for the confetti amount, having never ordered it before, I didn't know how much I was getting. When I tried to contact them to tell of the wrong product, no one responded."
3,"""Sand County Almanac"" is a better combination of essays","I tend to throw all the naturalists/conservationists/environmentalists into one big group and think of them in similar terms. I temporarily forgot that Aldo Leopold came to the field with a hunting background. And even though he writes about being forever affected by the regretable dying fire in a she-wolf's eyes in _Sand County Almanac_, none of that feeling is conveyed here. There's a lot of hunting in this book. A lot. Part II is one camping trip after another, with a fair amount of innocent animals providing food along the way. If you're like me and would rather not witness the carnage, read just four or five of the selections: ""A Man's Leisure Time,"" ""Country,"" ""Natural History,"" and all of Part III. You probably won't miss anything crucial by doing so, and you'll get the gist of Aldo Leopold's ideas about conservation and the land ethic. His philosophic musings make for worthwhile reading. It's too bad more of them don't appear here."
5,The Best of LAD,"This is by far my favorite LAD cd...the writing,playing and production is better than the others.If youre not famaliar with LAD...try this one first!"
4,A Nice Story of Life Behind the Fences,"I was born in the Atomic City during the 60's, and grew up hearing the stories of my parents life 'behind the fences'. The book provided a glimpse of the way in which people endured hardship and sacrifice in the name of national security and for an often misunderstood (and rarely discussed) science. Many of the places mentioned in the story still exist today. This story may have meant more to me as a native to the area than to those simply looking for a story about the Manhattan Project, as it focused more on the daily lives of the people than the scientific matter."
3,The Human Story of Oak Ridge,"Those looking for technical, scientific information or Manhattan Project secrets wont be satisfied with this book. However, it provides an incredibly detailed account of social issues, and the effects of a secret city on a person's psyche. It highlights stories of human sacrifice, class warfare and living under Big Brother's thumb in the name of National Security and scientific proweress. Its yet another story of how the government attempted a secret project and succeded, but as a dismal failure on the human front.Unfortunately, the story was written by a couple of UT (Tennessee) professors, who are not exactly professional writers. Gramatical errors and poor sentance structure plague each chapter. But despite the quality of writing, this is an incredible story that I could not put down!Anyone interested in The WWII home front, baby boomers, E Tennessee history, and governement secrets would find this a fascinating read!"
5,An essensale gide to basic prefomance horse training.,As A Former student of montes I remember the days this book was in progress on the Foreman ranch.Every line was proven and rehersed over and over to make it as clear as possable.As a ridding instructor I find myself refuring people to this book over and over agin.Althogh some of the style has changed the basics are becoming more and more important with the incresed levels of compation.This should be the first book for aspiring horse handlers.
4,boudica dreaming the bull,"having read dreaming the eagle and the hound this book is a natural follow on and has all the characters and exciting visions of our past ancestors and the way they lived and died. the two religions clashing ,the roman's and the britain's,and thier beliefs seemes even more important than the colonian aspirations of the romans trying to conquer britain. i loved all three that i have read and look forward to the next one."
4,Great Portrayal of Characters,"This was a very compelling narrative with excellent characterization. I wondered whether Manda Scott or Robert Graves (I,Claudius) had a truer portrayal of the Roman Emperor Claudius. I think Manda Scott is probably more authentic than Graves.I noticed that there was relatively little presence of Boudica in this book. There was a great deal of focus on her husband and brother. I didn't mind this because her brother had some interesting internal conflicts."
4,second book in the boudica series,"Really enjoyed the first one - this second book is all about war; very blood thirsty, harrowing and heartbreaking. A little bit difficult to read actually, although I know that it's all necessary. I hope the next book isn't so warlike :)."
4,A fighter for a free Britain,"I am finding this sequel equally as absorbing as the first part of the trilogy. I find I am learning to appreciate my ancestors (and my history teachers) more. There is so much to admire in the characters and beliefs of those who lived so long ago, and yet so much that is timeless. Manda Scott gives life and depth to those long-ago warriors."
3,Dreaming the Bull,"This second book in the series is not as easy to read as the first. Perhaps it is because it deals more with Boudica's brother, Ban, (Valerius) that it was not quite what I was expecting. having stated that, it is necessary to read this book to fully understand what goes on in the remainder of the series. Scott brings to life the times of the ancient Britains, her understanding of the tribes, the relationships between the tribes and the interaction between the Britains and the Romans provides a knowledge for the reader whilst still being an enthrawling story that is difficult to put down."
5,A Pleasant Surprise,"Piazzolla fans rejoice! When I received notice of this album, I looked over the list of songs and thought OK, I know most of these and its going to be the typical compilation of the SOS, but I'll buy it for the few songs with which I am unfamiliar. What I got was a pleasant surprise! I am floored by some of the tremendous arrangements presented here. Of 20 cuts on the CD, I had not heard 19 of the arrangements before and this after many years of listening to Piazzolla. BMG Entertainment, which compiled the compositions on this CD has done an excellent job of mixing older material with the contemporary. I like every song but Lo Que Vendra, Nonino, Preparense, La Primera Palabra, and Chiquilin de Bachin are standouts. The CD opens with the Piazzolla signature tune Adios Nonino and closes with a smashing rendition of Verano Porteno. If you are a true Piazzolla fan, you are going to like this one!"
3,"They were good on vinyl, but much better live!","All of Canned Heat's stuff is great. But the reason I'm writing this , is, I wanted to know if there is anybody out there that saw Canned Heat Live At Bull Island Rock Festival (near New Harmony, Indiana). I have seen many live acts, but I have never seen a group relate to the audience like they did at this festival. We were standing right next to the stage, and I swear these guys were having a blast. They were still riding the high from Woodstock, 2 years earlier, but I swear there was something going on magical with these guys. Sorry I didn't review the cd, but I just wanted to share some positive Canned Heat history with you."
5,Great Music,Great for dance practice or for a party. Good selection of Cha Cha music for dancing as opposed to the music of a particular band.
3,"Fairly well written, but of very limited utility","I have to wonder why Wizards keeps publishing books about areas that almost no one has any interest in playing in. Shining South continues this trend. Wouldn't a book about the Old Empires, the Vilhon Reach, Chondath or the Tethyr/Amn/Calimsham region be far more interesting?Shining South is fairly well done for what it is, but unless you plan on using Halruaa, Dambrath, or Luiren in a campaign, its not terribly useful. Dambrath is an interesting nation, run by half-drow priestesses of Loviatar, but it is so remote from the rest of Faerun, you'd have to set your campaign here to use this information.I will also say that Wizards now provides far less detail on these new nations than the FRCS provides. There is no over-all national population breakdown and not every city receives a write-up, making the usefulness of the book even more questionable.In summary, the book reads well, but its of almost no utility to the general FR player or DM."
2,not what I expected.,"This book, based on personal experience was a bit New Age for me and I was looking more for factual information instead of mystic thoughts."
1,poor quality,"For die-hard collectors only. Very poor visual and audio quality. I assumed it would have been decently watchable to have been put in dvd, but nope, it's not."
5,Rudolph!,Any one who watched this movie as a child will know this movie. It brings back memories and holiday cheer. If as some one older you don't like the songs you can still have fond memories about the movie. For those uninitiated this is perhaps the most recognizable claymation movie of all time and renders the story of how Rudolph came to be as a holiday character.
1,Squeaky,The shoe is comfortable but runs wide and squeaks with every step. Looks like a man's bedroom slipper. It's comfortable to wear around the house or in the yard but that's it. Not an attractive shoe.
3,Gentle Souls Golum Slide,Pros: Beautiful leather is buttery soft.Cons: I have a high instep and found the top of the shoe is too snug and bruised the top of my foot after wearing the first time. No arch support. Wish I could get my money back.
5,Impressive and Complete Review,"This cdrom provides students with a complete review of all the types of grammar questions that appear on the CBT. I was particularly impressed by the variety of sentence constructions,the diversity of sentence lengths, and the excellent way that the program reinforces student learning. I teach intermediate and advanced level German students, and they have uniformly improved their scores on the structure (grammar) section after studying the examples given. I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs to get a higher TOEFL score."
3,My Fish Don't Seem To Like It,"I take care of a large outdoor pond with about 5 Large Koi, 10 Medium Size Koi, and 30 smaller fish, in addition there is a turtle and two frogs. The pond is covered in lily pads and other water plants. I was feeding the fish food made by Hikari and the fish seemed to go right after it and it never lasted more than a minute. I switched to Pond Care Summer Food for two reasons it was cheaper and I was curious to see what Summer Food was about. My fish dont seem to go after the floating pellets at all. I can reason that there is so much plant life that it is hard for them to see the pellets and that it is so hot (average 105 a day in Vegas) but I know that before I made the switch the fish attacked the pellets and now they seem to float for some time before the fish go after the food.I will be switching back to Hikari when this bag is done."
5,One of the best,"This album is one of the best album song by the Moments, my favorite is ""Next time I see you"" ..I have every song they ever made, but I wanted it on cd, for this price I think I gotta find a way to record to cd. I really glad I got chance see them in concert on Crenshaw, back in the 1980's, before Harry Ray pass away..Rest in peace Harry Ray."
5,Guitar Strings,"If you're acoustic guitar needs to be re-strung, LaBells guitar strings are the best for my needs. I recommend that you give them a go."
3,"Not bad, but very glitchy.","I like the mouse, but half of the time it doesn't like to work. I'll move it around and the light that indicates that it's working will blink... but the mouse on the screen does nothing. It's also sometimes really slow, or really fast.Half of the time, I actually switch to another mouse that I bought around the same time. I kind of wish I got the one with a cord or a more update version of the wireless mouse."
4,"A great holster, but...","I just received my new holster today. I loved it, although after using it for two whole hours, the plastic clip broke and the phone fell to the ground! I am hoping it was just a fluke, but I'll have to wait and see whether Amazon will give me another one in its place, so I can't give it a complete ""thumbs up"" yet.One other caveat: it does NOT fit the ""extended battery,"" only the slim battery with the reduced amount of ""talk time."""
2,Buy 10 of these - you'll need them,You should expect this holster to break the first time you bump into something. The part of the holster that attaches to the belt clip is very weak and will break very very easily.
4,Does what it claims,"I brought a few small electrical appliances from Israel to the US and this transformer performs great, all devices work as they should. Its a bit cumbersome, but gets the job done."
5,Right choice at right time,Initially we had bought a transformer in the near by Indian store but it was useless in one go.... But till now i have used this 5 times and it is running really really good... When using this please dont overload the grinder as the fuse goes off... Extra fuses are a plus in this product... Overall i recommend buying this product without any doubt... The best of all... Thank you amazon...
4,Good Buy,"This was a really good device. I was able to plug in my electronic drumset that I brought from Qatar, and it worked. The convertor is simple to use and it is efficient. So far it hasn't given me any trouble. Seems to be working just fine."
1,Terrible :(,"It blows fuse every time, bad quality!!! Totally doesn't work!!! Don't waste your money. After about five minutes of useing, fuse blew. I replaced it with another fuse and it blew again. I don't want to use it anymore."
1,Fuse popped the first time,"I bought several of these for a big trip to Spain. I was disappointed that it was so bulky and heavy, so I had to return 3 of the 2 before I left. I brought one on my trip anyways because I have been stranded in Europe before without the right power converter for my hair straightener and blow dryer. The very first time I plugged it in and tried it, I could hear the fuse pop and then nothing.Fortunately, I got 2 other smaller models 'just in case' and they were sufficient for my trip. I would not recommend this unless you know a little bit more about these converters than I do and buy extra fuses and are patient enough to fiddle with it."
4,Heavier than we expected but works a treat,"We have used this for a baby monitor that we brought to the US from the UK, and also for a blu-ray player, neither of which worked on the 110V local supply. It works a treat. Just note that it's pretty heavy and quite bulky, so this is definitely not something I'd routinely pack in my suitcase for short tips."
4,Works great!,"I bought this to utilize a DVD player purchased overseas, and it works well. I haven't had any issues with it, the only thing that I wish were different is the direction of the overseas plug type because it tends to put the bulkiest part of the plug on the floor."
2,comes complete with volatile solvents,"As others have noted, upon opening the plastic bag the transformer is packed in, you're hit with an overpowering smell of some organic solvent.The only reason I can think of for this is that either they had no burn-in period whatsoever and just packed the item before the chemicals had cured, or that they mixed the chemicals wrong and they'll actually never set. the latter would be more serious, as it could lead to product failure.after 4 days in a semi-enclosed space outside, and two hours of running, I can still smell it a little. eventually it might suit my needs. It does seem to work fine.But if you were buying this to go overseas later this week, it would be useless. Your luggage would smell like a burning plastic factory"
1,blew all the fuses in 5 mins,"I bought this to power my British x-box 360 in America. Initially it worked, but after a minute or two of use (not even long enough to start a game), the fuse blew. Replaced it with the provided extra fuse, but this also blew too. All 3 fuses were gone within the first 5 minutes. I'll be returning this and looking for a different brand to replace it.Power Bright VC100W Voltage Transformer 100 Watt Step Up/Down 110 Volt - 220 Volt"
3,"WORKS, KIND OF.","This converter would be great if it came with a fuse that could actually handle 110V of power. I went through every fuse that was provided in 5 minutes. I had to finally go out and get my own fuses. If you buy this item, make sure you get your own fuses before you try to use it. Otherwise you are going to end up very frustrated."
1,"Terrible, total waste of money","I have a number of UK products I wanted to use in the US, including things like a heated brush. This product is useless: it blew with every item I tried to plug into it, even though I was careful to stay well within recommended wattage. I have no idea what it might work with - a toothbrush, perhaps. Impossible to know."
1,Show off your bad taste,"Here is a coffee table book that will demonstrate your lack of taste to all your friends. It's a perfect compliment to one of Kinkade's over-priced, mass-produced, numbered reproduction art products that some people hang over their Levitz sofa. Be sure to check for the letter of authenticity to be sure it's a genuine copy! (Now where did I place that velvet Elvis?)"
1,Gwen Stefani? #1 song for God knows how long,"I returned this...it's crap! It doesn't have Luda, Gwen Stefani, or even Em on it. Eamon's not on it either. Instead, they put stupid Fat Joe on here. Definitely don't buy this, it's terrible!"
5,Fantastic,Outstanding ... amazingly clear intro. Effective diagrams (some of the best I've found in ANY math book). Interesting examples/applications ... a+++
3,Not all items were delivered. . . . .,This book was labeled as BIOLOGY with CD-ROM - but the CD-ROM was missing when we got the book. Where as one of our friends ordered the same book from a different vendor and got the book with CD-ROM and in a better condition. First time we are disappointed with AMAZON purchase.
2,My Review on Shadowland,"Well before I say anything else, I want to say that I LOVE the Princess Diaries, Teen Idol, and All-American Girl but I just couldn't get into this one. It seemed kind of boring to me actually. I don't think it can compare AT ALL to the ones I listed above"
3,Why not help kids out a little bit?,"Meg Cabot's books are great... it wasn't my favorite series ever but hey, they were still good. But I'm not writing about the books. I'm writing about the search pages. Yahoo, Amazon, Google, etc. they haven't been giving the list of characters. I have a report due tomorrow, and I read the book months ago... ( the teacher gave us a due date & then changed it til after Christmas)... I can't remember what that girl's ghost's name is... I mean come on... would it kill you to give a list of the main characters!!!! Grrrrrrrrrr! O, & by the way... that isn't my real e-mail address. :-P"
4,A new meg cabot adventure,"Ever since I read ""all-american girl"" I loved meg cabot. I read all the princess diary books. I found the mediator and decided to give it a try. It was very good. It's about a girl named Sussanah. Her mom get's re-married and she moves to california. she is a mediator which means that she can talk too and see the dead. A ghost named Jesse is in her room. This is one part I don't like. Before she can even get too know Jesse, she yells at him to get out. Anyways, the first day of school, she sees this ghost who shot herself because her boyfriend broke up with her. Long story short, she has to battle the ghost.Theres one more thing that I didn't like. She is mean to the dead dad. If your dad was dead, you'd want to talk to him right? Instead she doesn't really like talking to him."
4,Great book!!!!!!!,this is one of the greatest book i have ever read it about this girl named Susannah Simon. she has to move to california were she will have to live because her mom got marrie to Andy and he lives there. Susannah is a mediator which is someone who can speak and feel ghost. Soon she find that a ghost named Jesse lives in her room who actually died there.As she gets to know Jesse a there is a nother ghost who has revenge in her mind and Susannah is in her way.this is a great ook. if you liked the other books writen by Meg Cabot you would really like this one. if you do then there are more books about Susannah and her ghost people.1. shadowland2. ninth key3. haunted4. darkest hour5. reuion6. twilight
3,3.5 Stars for Shadowland,"3.5 Stars - A fun, light, easy paranormal read - this book is nice beginning in the Mediator Series. The main Character Suze is true to most teens - going her own way to deal with the ghosts she's trying to send to the ""other side"". She's head strong and knows just how she likes to do things, which maybe isn't always the right way. However, throughout the book it makes you question whether or not she'll be able to get the job done.With some mystery - ghost's and a head strong teen, I look forward to find out more and what's coming next for Suze, not to mention finding out more about Jessie and to see where his part of the story leads.If your looking for a light mysterious read with ghosts? Then this is the perfect series for you."
5,Shadowland,"I am a book lover, and I'll read almost anything. This Book (series really) is one of my favorites. The writing isn't brillant, but sometimes the storyline counts more. Its about a girl who moves from New York to California. All she wants is to start over, but wait... there's a ghost of a 150 year old cowboy in her bedroom. It's funny, but serouse at the same time, sort of like reading a book by Fred and George Weasly. Well that was how the language was anyway."
5,One of the best books,This book is one of the best books out there today. Jenny Carroll is one of the best authors. Her use of Ghosts into real life and expressing the truth that they are around us is brilliant. I give this book 5 stars for it's quality in a readers intrest.
2,OK read,"The Mediator series is alright. It's not awesome, and the writing is not genius, but it's a story. At times, I felt kind of dumb reading this series because it seemed to drag on. The main character is a bit annoying too. Read if you have nothing better to do."
5,perfect,"ok, so I was bored.Its spring break and to spend some quality time at the beach, you need a book.I was desperate, I looked all over the library and only came out with this book. I was dissapointed. I don't normally read stuff like this, but I just need SOMETHING to read so I picked it up.I couldn't put it down. I had to go back the next morning to the library to see if they had the next one in the series... thank god they did.I loved the ending. It was perfect. It was one of those books u read, then u set down thinking ""wow, that was really [good]BR>it was too.. i mean. I read some good books. And im a sucker for series (Fearless-Francine Pascal and Sweep-Cate Tiernan)but this one really topped them all. I love how they ended it with the Beatles song Here Comes the Sun. do do doo dooo.."
2,disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book. Not what I expected. I read the fifth book of the series some years ago and enjoyed it, but I found it hard to believe this was the same series."
3,shadowland,"What is the book about?This book is all about a high school sophomore girl named Suze, who has the ability to communicate with the dead. She is mainly focused on putting the ghosts unresolved issues to rest so they can move on to the next world. Her mother remarried so she is now living with her new Step Family and going to school at a private school. She comes to meet the priest there who is also conveniently a mediator as well.What did I think?I thought this was a pretty quick easy book for me. It's not a book I was crazy about but I didn't mind it all that much. It's kind of hard to find a ""BAD book."" In my spare time if I have nothing else to read I might pick back up the series."
4,"Fast-Paced, Ghost busting action!",This fast-paced novel doesn't disappoint. It's chocked-full of sarcasm and ghost busting action. The only thing that didn't really set well with me was all the cashmere the characters wore...[...]
4,"Wonderful, Meg Cabot!","I was iffy at first on if this book would be any good, but as I got further my suspicions were prooved wrong. The catchy plot and mysterious characters kept me interested the whole time, I havn't read anymore books in this series but I plan on it for sure!"
5,Loved it!,This book has become one of my favorite series. It was a very intriguing story and kept me interested the whole way through every book.
4,Quick read. I read this in one evening.,"This is a great, fast paced book, that I read in an evening. The main character, Suze, is a strong female lead. She kicks ghost butt, and takes no prisoners. I find it interesting that Suze is so outwardly violent towards ghosts and yet she seems so scared and venerable on the inside. The quality of the writing in this book has compelled me to seek out the second in this series, which I am hoping is just as good as the first. There are hints of romance in the book, but the story does not go too far in that direction. For my tastes, I would have preferred more romance. A great pick if you are looking for strong female leads, with paranormal adventure."
1,Perfect Manual,"This book is a perfect manual for creating a 100% self centered child and an authentic narcissist.This book is also not very practical. Not everyone has the luxury of quitting work and charging $$$ for 30 min consultation to support their homeschooling and organic grocery shopping habits.It is also not clear what are the author's education credentials because her style, syntax and grammar an not indicative of someone who completed graduate school."
5,Love it or Hate it. Just read it.,"I definitely do not love this book but its probably the most important parenting book that i've read. Even if you put it down cursing about the absurdity of the author's recommendations, something inside you will have clicked. you dont have to adopt this thesis. you just have to synthesize it with your understanding of what attitudes shaped you and how those attitudes are now assumptions you have and that society shares mostly, about how to raise your kid in a manner that is inherently coercive and violent. if you become aware of this and see how this method affects who we become as people in the world and the global possibilities if we change the way we rear our children to be nonviolent and less coercive .... well then, youre on your way to a higher state of consciousness even if you dont like the book!!!"
1,Completely out of touch with child development - buyer beware,"The concepts espoused in this book have a superficial allure, but in practice, simply don't work and are often harmful to children and families. None of it is based on science or a comprehensive understanding of childhood development. It's more of an esoteric self-help book than a useful guide to raising healthy, happy children. 99% of the times when I've put Aldort's advice and ideas into practice in my own family, everyone has suffered.Buyer beware."
2,Disappointed with the book,"I had really high hopes for this book after reading many, many positivie reviews. Unfortunately, I was really disappointed. It did not offer advice/suggestions that jived with my line of parenting.Let me also add that this book might be wonderful for others...it just wasn't wonderful for me!"
1,Smug and self-satisfied,"Didn't like this book at all. The author frequently holds her kids up as examples of piano prodigy etc so is essentially using them to justify her competitive streak (albeit manifested differently from the norm) as a mother. Don't encourage kids to be competitive, ok in parents though?? Also the idea of never putting kids in situations that are hard for them isnt practical eg where she suggests that if kids get ratty in the shops this is understandable (yes, I agree with this part), solution: so don't take them with you to the shops. This for me is not a useful strategy as for many parents that either means go hungry or leave kids home unsupervised.... Surely discussing strategies to support kids through difficult situations is more useful (would be for me at any rate)"
2,Strange,"I thought this book was definitely an alternative parenting style, then when I read it I was like, whooooo, this is really alternative. Probably works for some people, but I doubt would work with my kid. I enjoyed reading the book for taking some ideas from, but definitely wouldnt adapt 100 percent to her teachings. I was definitly disapointed when right after I purchased the book I found out she doesnt really have her PHd, and her reasoning behind that is fishy.... however the book was an interesting read, but not for us."
5,Life changing,"I haven't finished reading this book yet and it's ALREADY changed my life. My parenting perspective has shifted, there is more love and less dominating and controlling between myself and my 3 & 5 year old kids. I plan to finish the book and then read it all again... oh and give copies to all my Mom friends!! If you have an open mind and are willing to try a new plan, then this is a must read."
2,"Used to love, before realizing the stress it was causing me...","I have read and re-read the pertinent parts of this book (not fully through yet, because my son is yet 2). I gave it a 4 because I wish there was more on toddlers in it. I have also purchased her CD's and had a consult with her. She is doing fantastic work. I would recommend her work to anyone who wants to parent gently and consciously.---February 2013I am editing this because this book has resulted in long term stress for me as a result of trying to live up to Naomi's standards. Constantly asking myself what I was doing wrong because my son was having tantrums, etc. There are a lot of gems in the book but I was taking it way too seriously and also recently found out that her PhD is not even real (which left me feeling rather betrayed)."
4,Every Parent NEEDS This Book,"When it comes to parenting, Naomi Aldort ""gets it"". If every parent raised their child in accordance with this book, the world would be a far better place. ""Raising Our Children"" is this generation's ""How to Talk So Kids Will Listen"". And, its better. Every parent NEEDS this book.~ Nick Kanieff, Personal Coach and Parent"
2,Too far out there,"I bought this book for my daughter, who has a 4-year-old daughter. But I haven't even dared to give it to her. I think aspects of this person's approach are probably helpful--but it just goes too far. The approach seems so completely child-centered that I don't know how children would learn to fit into the real world. I think the Positive Discipline approach is more workable."
4,Beautifully written adaptation,"Although the fables are not exactly true to the classics I remember, the updated language works perfectly for reading aloud. Never awkward or stiff, the language is very well written, and the illustrations are lovely. This is a favorite of my 5 year old daughter (and mine too, since I love that they stories are a great teaching tool.)"
3,decent collection,Decent selection of fables in this compilation and well illustrated. I don't particularly enjoy the non-traditional phrasing of the morals at the end of the stories.
3,A young band with a big sound,"Just heard the Keller Bros. open for John Hiatt in Denver and thought they were a lot of fun--maybe they're a little better live, but the album is strong and has a terrific big sound and lots of energy. I like Mike Keller's voice, and they have a lot of polish for a young band."
4,poppy but unique,"im not a big fan of the pop punk scene but this band has a unique stlye and the lead singer has good vocals. its a good cd. ""puppet show"" was in the movie ""Bum Fights"""
4,One of the best bands in Las Vegas,"If you want a taste of what the Campas have to offer, this is a great CD to buy, and don't hesitate if you haven't heard them, because they're really good, and one of my favorite bands... But if you're short on cash, you can just surf on over to mp3.com/happycampers, and most of these songs are ready to be downloaded for free. However, if you're from Vegas, and you can get a copy of their first CD, I would suggest doing that. Their first CD is a classic, and while S'more Core does kick [butt], many would agree that their 1999 release ""Campfire Songs"" is much better. But all in all, if you want a taste of the Happy Campers, or what Las Vegas has to offer, this record is worth checking out. And I just can't wait to see what their next CD is gonna be like with their new drummer Jay Losey (from another awesome vegas band, 7 Foot Midget). :)"
4,Very good,Very well written and packed with great sexual tension. I would have liked more written on the relationship of Jada and Rome because of the seriousness of Jada's situation. But this did not take anything away from the book. Very nice....
5,THE BOOK WAS WORTH THE WAIT,"THE BOOK WAS WORTH THE WAIT I MET HER IN DEC AND SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS WORKING ON THIS BOOK.AND IT WAS GREAT.FUNNY,HEARTWARMING AND GREAT PLOTS.NOT SLOW MOVING JUST RIGHT I LOVED IT FINISHED IN ONE DAY.AND THE BOOK STARTED NEW ROMANCES I CAN NOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.I MET MRS JACKSON WHEN SHE WAS LOOKING FOR BOOKS HERSELF I DI NOT KNOW WHO SHE WAS SHE ASKED ME WHO WAS MY FAVORITE AUTHOR AND HER NAME WAS THE FIRST I SAID ALONG WITH FRANCIS RAY AND GYWNNE FORSTERAND SHE SAID HI I AM BRENDA JACKSON I WAS FLOORED AND SHE IS JUST AS NICE AS HER PICTURE.PLEASE READ THE BOOK THE WHOLE LINE."
5,My Favorite Madaris Novel,"Forwarning: I'm a huge Brenda Jackson fan, so I'm trying my best not to be biased.Nettie & Ashton became my favorite couple out of all the Madaris novels. The substories added depth to the characters and overall story. I love how you can pick up anywhere in the Madaris Novels and not feel left out for not reading books that were released prior. It also gives you peeks into the lives of previous characters you feel in love with. Best of all, it introduces you to new characters leading the way for even better romantic stories.After reading ""Surrender,"" I searched over 4 bookstores to find the story of Alex Maxwell and Christy Madaris.However, in ""Surrender,"" Ashton's part Native American heritage adds to the appeal of his character and helps him to seduce not just Nettie, but the reader as well. His character adds a sense of mystery that you can't help but be intrigued by.Overall, this novel is packed with drama involving multiple characters. This is definite a must-read."
2,Love Brenda but...,"This one could've been written better. I'm not feeling the whole thing about him having dreams about her having his babies and that she's going to become his wife all because he's part Cherokee Indian and that's just so unrealistic. It's like she made her character act as if because he's part Cherokee Indian that everything he said was supposed to be right no matter what. And it was kind of creepy at one point where he was in her room and she asked what he was doing and he said he was kidnapping her and then he knocked her out by doing some star trek move. NOT COOL!!! No Brenda, I know this book is almost 10 yrs old and I'm glad you put back in publication but this was not one of your best works."
5,Surprisingly fun read.,"I read this book to keep going in order with the Madaris series thinking I wasn't dying to know what happened with Ashton and Nettie but I'd check it out anyway. This was Excellent! I loved Ashton and his whole American Indian manly thing. Come on now, not every man can pull off that kind of underwear :) There was a lot going on in this book for sure, but it's written well enough that your mind is not scrambling to keep up. As usual it's awesome to see the latest goings on of the Madaris crew and getting a glance of the characters yet to come. As always the Steam these men can generate is extremely fun to read. I'm almost scared to keep reading the series because so far I've loved each character, I hope they continue to be this enjoyable. LOVE the Madaris series!"
5,Soulmates,"Colonel Ashton Sinclair is dedicated to the U.S. Marines and Netherland Brooms is a divorced restaurant owner. The two met 3 years ago but Nettie ignores her attraction to him and explains to him that she does not date military men because she needs the stability. Ashton is part Native American and had a vision about her so he knows there is no other for him.Ashton is so lovable; he loves his woman and instead of giving up on her, he shows her that he's not going anywhere until she realizes they are meant to be together. When she decides she wants just one night, he lets her know he wants forever and that together they can work everything else out. I could go on and on about this book--it's just that good. Ms. Jackson does an excellent job, as usual!"
3,Not one of her best.,"This book had way to many characters and subpolts going on. I felt that sometimes those subplots took away from Ashton and Nettie's own romance story. I know that the Madarises have a big family and a lot of friends but man was it overwhelming! Also, Ashton's antics were a bit overbearing in a stalker kind of way. He would not take no for an answer. I guess that was the kind of man she needed (Lol).I think this book would have been better if those subplots had their own book becasue they definetly had the potential. It was nice to see what the rest of the Madarises and their friends have been doing."
2,Ms. Jacksons Latest Masterpiece!,"Brenda Jackson has done it again. This story includes old and familar charaters from her books. The Madaris', The Maxwells and the rest of the gang, and they are all here in rare form! I finished this book in one day and would highly reccommend you sit back grab a cool drink and enjoy the ride!"
1,Unbelievable and Boring,"This book is frought with poorly substantiated and senseless fantasy elements. The fact that the hero (and I use the term loosely) can ""forsee"" his future conveniently allows the author to simply make the main characters fall together without any sensible reason for doing so. There is no basis for the actions of the characters and no explanation of their feelings. The plot takes one to many unrealistic turns to be believable, and the language is hackneyed. A huge disappointment."
1,No backing up to correct dictation errors,"Lots of fancy features that work fine.But I dictate long professional letters. Of course I occasionally misspeak and need to back up (a few seconds or a couple minutes) to record over my mistake -- otherwise I waste my typist's time, and I have to pay her to type stuff then erase it.This backup and re-record feature has been standard on $50 tape dictaphones for decades.The DS-30 can not back up and record over mistakes. You said it, you're stuck with it. I confirmed this with Olympus tech support. They suggested I buy a $450 ""professional"" model instead.This is not a machine for dictating professional letters."
4,Very satified except couple improvments need to make for DS-30,"This is very elegant small guy, so far functions very well. I got very satisfied from the sound quality and sensitivity. I use this to record the prof. lectures. One flaw I think they could improve is putting a clip on it, so it would slip around in my bag or pocket. Overall, this is great product. Recommend!"
4,Great voice recorder,This is a great unit that has excellent sound quality and MANY options. Basic operation is very simple but you must study the instruction manual to get the most from the DS-30.
5,Great for Recording Lectures,"I upgraded to the DS-30 from the VN4100PC and the difference in quality is very noticeable. I originally purchased the VN 4100 PC for my daughter to use in college to record lectures in class (not a lecture hall mind you but a normal size class room). While the 4100 would be okay for recording your thoughts or ideas, it was inadequate for recording in a classroom setting. You had to strain to hear what the professor was saying, making the whole experience of listening to previous lectures a less than enjoyable experience. That's when I upgraded to the DS-30, which records in stereo. More importantly, the quality of the recording is dramatically better than the 4100. If you want to record lectures the DS-30 is the one to buy! Yes, it costs more, but it's worth it."
5,DS30 for music,"Even though this recorder is designed primarily for recording voice, it does a fine job with music. I've used it to record piano and voice and other musical instruments in live performances. The results are altogether satisfactory for all but the most critical purpose. The ease of use and long battery life are big pluses. The recordings are saved as WMA (Windows Media Audio)files. These can be easily transfered to a PC via USB (Cable provided) and then converted to CD format or MP3."
4,Good one for learning music or language,"It is a best product in the DS- series of Olympics. The product is value for money and its completely stuffed with features. Though, the audio quality is not excellent, it can be good device for a audio based learner to have.Hav funShreedhar"
2,"Good sound quality, but does not support MP3 recording and is a little bulky","This product is more bulky than some of Olympus' older recorders and it still doesn't support MP3 for recording. For me as a Linux and Mac user, going through the Windows file format is always a slight pain. I returned the product to Amazon."
2,High Alert,"The manual doesn't tell you this, but you have to reformat the recorder everytime you use it and download audio because it doesn't delete. It stays in the cache. This should be an essential part of the instruction book but it isn't. I learned after having problems and calling the techs."
2,"Unlike her other books, this one develops much too slowly.","I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the First American series, until this book. The book develops slowly, dwells on details far too long, and has no real characters to identify with until later in the book. Those that one is later drawn to are glossed over in the early part of the book, or become so muddled with details, that I found myself speed reading. Over half way through Time Beyond Beginning seems to fall into the style of the other First American series. From that point it becomes entertaining."
1,Time Beyond Beginning,The book was never received and Betterworldbooks provided no way to contact them about it that I could find.
2,a booooor,"Had the book been about one third the length, the author might have had a chance of making it go. As it is, it is simply boring. A waste of time."
2,Disappointed,"I have followed the Cathy comic strip for many years. I have come to know her characters and even have felt that she was following my life. I ordered this because I wanted a keepsake about the wedding, but found upon its arrival that I could not enlarge the print on my Kindle. I sadly returned the book.Cathy; please come backHow was the weddingDid you ever have children"
1,Dissenting viewpoint,"I have read CATHY and followed the strip, because i read that page in the newspaper. I've found the writing to be going downhill, the artwork is still as awful as it ever was and the way Cathy gets a conflict is to manufacture it herself. If nothing is happening she decides she's too fat. Or Thinks he dog doesn't love her. Or Irving doesn't love her. Something.If you think this strip is excellent you need to get you head out of the litterbox and look at other cartoon strips like BREWSTER ROCKET, FOX TROT, LIO and other things you can find on Amazon. This strip was dropped out of the local paper recently and no one complained."
3,Good Collection,"It is a definitive collection of her greatest hits, I was specifically interested in a couple of tracks Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree and My Whole World is Falling down that I had never had previously in my collection and these were both present as per original."
3,Brenda Lee Collection,"This CD arrived in a timely manner and was in good condition. I purchased it as a gift for my mother and so far as I know, she is very happy."
1,I'm Sorry,I loved Brenda Lee's 'I'm Sorry' and one other song and think she is best when doing bluesy stuff but most of these songs reflect a rock or popular style I do not like. Unique voice but commonplace on rock stuff for the most part. I should have simply downloaded I'm sorry and forgot about this CD.
3,"""Sound is Not Good ""","Can't understand how everyone is raving about this, love Brenda and love her music but whoever did this should have more OJT for the sound is like it's inside a box."
3,family,This is just a good light hearted read in the superhero community. Yeah there are fights but the main concept of this book help established the bonding of these individuals into something of a family. This was evident as seen in the later titles of Idenity Crisis and Infinite Crisis when it was pay back time for killing/hurting one of their own.
3,technique gets in the way,"this is really really really really prog. super technical playing by all. a lot of talent here, but i just find it very hard to listen to. oh, but i totally love the names to the tracks- made me laugh. obviously creative people behind this. so yeah if you want to rock out... this is not that album. if you are horny for chops, this is the album."
1,Damon Che is Don Cab?,"Don Caballero have always had members leave, but this is ridiculous. Che is not Don Cab even if he is an amazing drummer and started the band. Ian Williams for one is a huge reason for the Don Caballero sound that I always gravitated towards and without him the band is incomplete. Why Che decided on naming this new group under the Don Caballero name rather than Speaking Canaries or something else baffles me. More importantly, the music is BORING on this album. It's like the new members only influences were Yes and ELP sans vocals. In other words, no spontaneity, hardly and time changes or dynamics and weak predictible guitar/bass lines. Avoid this album like the plague and pick up any of the Battles EPs or better yet get the real Don Cab works like Singles Breaking Up or What Burns. There is a ton of other great instrumental bands old and new in this type of vein that blow this ""new"" Don Caballero to pieces."
5,This is a great CD with lots of Mandolin sounds.,"I just purchased this CD and both my wife and I are enjoying it very much. The songs Azalea Waltz and Pass Me Not are especially appealing as they remind the listener of music associated with the Colonial Age in America; sort of Minuet style, but not chamber music. None of the music is hardcore Bluegrass (no Banjo), but rather a great blend of the four string instruments with heavy emphasize on the Mandolin and soft Fiddle. I highly recommend this CD, especially if you happen to play the Mandolin."
5,Excellent CD of Instrumental Bluesgrass,"This is a great cd. I was interested in getting some instrumental mandolin music and found this one and it made me a fan of Butch. The cd is excellent and gets played over and over. Everyone in the family likes it. The songs tend to have three or four piece groups with many uptempo tunes which have driving bass lines. This is a good cd for a drive in the county, though you may find the gas pedal going lower than it should."
4,Essential for capturing the rhythm of the body,"I just bought this book and I find it's full of really valuable information - the sort that's rarely taught at art schools in figure drawing classes. Art classes more often focus on the contour of the body, or the mass of it, and rarely teach how to convey the energy of the body, which is so essential to making figure drawings that ""live"" - that have that ""wow"" factor. This book illustrates really well, how to see the rhythm inherent in the human form and how to use that knowledge to create forceful, dynamic drawings."
4,Great for beginnners!,"This book is great for beginners. It has many sketches that students can use for ideas about techniques and style. My only disappointment I had was the quality of the scans/pictures of some of the sketches. Some were a little dark, and hard to read. The paper is also somewhat flimsy. Other then that, it's a great book for those who are trying to learn how to capture movement in a form. Highly recommended!"
5,Two thumbs up!!,A very useful book to give more life and energy to your illustrations and animation drawings!
2,Hate it!,"I was so disappointed in this clock. If I had seen it in a store I never would have bought it. The settings are located on each side of the clock and are hard to see and difficult to set. I hated the night light and it cannot be turned off without turning off the alarm! Even turning the clock to the wall did not keep the light from disturbing me. An alarm clock and flashlight is a good idea, but in this case the flaslight does not stay on unless you hold the button down.I bought 4 of them, planning to use as gifts, but will return 3 of them since I don't know anyone that I would give them to."
1,Stopped working after a few weeks.,"Well, I initially thought this was a fairly good clock (although its buttons were not very secure against accidental pushing). And then after just a few weeks of uneventful light usage, it stopped working - no sign of life at all."
4,Travel Alarm Clock,"I like the fact that the night light stays on. The numbers on the display are large and easy to see. This is what I was looking for. I was hoping to pay less, but I got what I wanted."
2,"OK concept, poor execution","Most nights, I wake up several times and check the time (worrywart). If there isn't a lighted clock nearby, I end up fretting for awhile until I get fully awake and fumble around for my watch. This clock should have fixed the problem. However, it is very dim and only visible from just the right angle. A secondary annoyance is that if it is jarred the battery slips in its compartment causing a power interruption and losing the time and alarm setting."
1,Not good quality,"Every time I travel, which is weekly, the clock needs to be reset. Evidently, it does not like the rigors of being in a suitcase."
5,Leaving Tokyo for Las Vegas (in a Flash)!,"I buy watches like Imelda Marcos buy shoes! I've been a ""watch kinda guy"" ever since I was able to tell time. Like sunglasses, whether designer types or unique ones, I have a weakness for time pieces. I've received quite a few compliments from my co-workers for the ""Jackpot""; now, all I have to do is read up on all instructions for the added features for my watch. KATCHINGGG!!!"
2,"Unique, but cheaply made","This is a pretty neat watch with some serious downfalls. First, the leather band is scratchy and poorly made. The digits on the face are a bit faint and hard to read and the sounds that the watch make are very annoying. It is cool to be able to play slots on your phone though. Its more novelty then something I want to wear everyday."
5,Gibraltor,"This is a great re-structuring view of Women artists in the Victorian era. Once you've read this, everything looks different and it makes you want to re-visit novels like Jane Eyre and Middlemarch and Sense and Sensibility just to see how much they have changed. Madwomen is a work of creativity as much as criticism. It changes you. Once you have read this, you find yourself in a whole different ocean."
4,"an excellent, if outdated, book","As a former student of Prof. Gubar, I can attest to the importance of this book within feminist literary circles: Gilbert and Gubar, Inc. created a piece of scholarship that transformed the way students of literature read literature. The book's place among feminist literary criticism today attests to the importance of their mission--were it not for Gilbert and Gubar, someone else, perhaps today, would be performing this kind of work. The fact remains, however, that the proliferation of feminist critique, whether from Robyn Wiegman or Lauren Berlant, makes this text an essential primer for feminist criticism, but not as compelling as the works it tacitly bore."
2,Wanna make a living with a B&B - this book is not for you,"We are looking to open a B&B that will support our family. This does not fit the author's defintion of a B&B, and this book is definitely geared toward a smaller operation. If you are looking to open a few rooms in your home to earn some extra income, this book would probably be useful."
3,"Plentiful information, but somewhat disorganized.","This manual is geared toward the smaller operation, a home-based bed & breakfast. It reads easily for the person making the transition from living in a home to using the home for a part-time business.The information is somewhat scattered throughout the chapters, some is covered twice. Information could be categorized better.I did an inter-library loan of two books. I like the graphical layout of this book much more than the others. I am now going to purchase my own copy where I can make notes."
5,A Great Resource,"I gained a lot of knowledge about starting a B&B from this book. The author goes into great detail about everything you need to do or think about before you start this venture. The information is just a little out-dated, but still pertinent."
1,not worth the price tag,poor production - basic concepts for beginners only - compared to free videos on full tilt academy - this dvd is crap!!!
5,The ideal reference for the Minnesota vacationer,"Written by the father and daughter team of David and Monica Wright, Great Minnesota Taverns is a cheerful and informative guide to historic and entertaining taverns located all over the land of 10,000 lakes. From lists of Minnesota beer festivals and events, to beer publications, tavern web sites, tavern descriptions arranged by geography, and so much more, Great Minnesota Taverns is the ideal reference for the Minnesota vacationer or local resident looking to enjoy the best tavern ambience Minnesota has to offer."
3,There are no coincidences in life,"I was attracted to this book because I was planning a trip to Mexico city to visit the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The forward is by Janice T. Connell and I love her books on Medjugorje so I purchased it.The book did not turn out to be a travel guide as I expected. Instead it has general information on the background of the Apparitions at each of approx 50 sights, many I have never heard of. Good reading, just not what I was looking for.I still plan to read it all the way through and perhaps it will lead me to visit a shrine I am not yet familiar with."
5,Next Best Thing,"If Jantzen's view of art history seems lifeless and distant, Henry Sayre has something to say to you. It's the best survey I've seen in terms of making art accessible and demonstrating a continuing tradition. The CD-ROM is an excellent bonus, especially for readers who have never seen an artist at work. Ever wonder how a print is made? There's a demonstration."
5,very pleased,"I was under stress to get this book asap for my summer semester class, I explained this to the seller and she ups'd to me and took on the expense herself. EXTREMELY GENEROUS!!! definately a great seller my highest recommendations"
3,"Fast Delivery, ok Product","Although I received this product in a timely manner, an entire chapter was missing from the book. I went ahead and kept it only b/c i did not have time to reorder another one due to my needing in for a class. Make sure to ask if any pages are missing!"
1,"NOT WORTH BUYING, ITS TABS ARE INCORECT","Beware when purchasing any AMSCO books that tab AC/DC.... some are correct, but alot, infact TOO MANY are tabbed incorectly... i dont just mean there in wrong positions... i mean they havent even tabbed the same song... its half and half with this book... half the songs are ok and correct.... half are bad and sloppy...dont pay any more then $10 for this. There is too much that is incorect. AMSCO dont even take the time to realise they have incorect tabs, because there still putting the same WRONG tabs into there latest books! Avoid AMSCO, or dont pay alot.This particuler book features WHO MADE WHO and they tab the opening chords as D5, C5, A5..... the song is in C5, A5, G5...the whole song is completly tabbed wrong!Dont purchase these sloppy, carelesly contructed books by AMSCO"
1,Not so great,"Billy's voice is now just ordinary, a victim of puberty, and his choice of material is tired and boring. Buy some of his earlier work because this is pretty poor."
3,Keep the voice and get new songwriters.,"I have been a fan of Billy's since 'One Voice' back in 2000. I was mesmerized. He followed this up with his Christmas album later that year and it's still my favorite Christmas album. Then 'Dare to Dream' blew me away. I bought spare copies of these three albums in case they got scratched.When 'Heartsongs' came out in 2003, I found it moving. No, not quite as good as previous CDs but very good on its own. And I didn't get an extra copy. But I waited for the follow up, hoping there would be one. And then, two years later I was on the waiting list for 'Everything and More' and it was, well... not everything and certainly not more. True, his voice has aged well which was a fear of mine. But I just couldn't get into the songs. This is just a ho-hum CD.I understand the Billy fans will not find this review helpful and I wish I could blindly follow."
3,Everything and Less,I am somewhat dissatisfied with this latest effort from the talented Billy Gilman. His vocals are fine. He amply demonstrates his ability to sing any kind of song. It's the material he has to work with that is disappointing. Most of the songs have a staleness to them. I'd like to see him do more covers. Please put BEN on one of your future releases!
4,"A good album, but still rooms of improvement.","No doubt, Billy's Voice is soothing and refreshing. The album is good, but not perfect.The album is a mature version of Dare to Dream, the CD cover and the music genre resembles that particular CD.There are some good songs like peaceable kingdom, is anybody out there, looked into the wings and I am not mean anymore etc. They are of high quality, but not impressive enough. There is no song in this album that can stand out of the other.What I want is a total breakthrough of Billy, but I can't see anything like that in this album.While Billy is nearly 17, his voice is still not very stable, I think the pneumonia during his vocal change has totally ruined his voice.I am glad that his songs are still easy to listen, and i like most of them, but Billy needs to pay much more effort in order to make a great breakthrough in his music career."
2,Pray for him,His voice is fine. These songs are horrible. Who wrote them? Certainly nobody with talent. Billy needs to ditch this squeaky clean image. He's not singing to kindergartners anymore. He just comes across as fake on this album.
1,"great voice, depressing lyrics. sorry BG","I think he has a great voice, very much like Jesse McCartney's, but i also think that the only upbeat songs on this album are hey little suzie (the cause of all that), and missed you onsunday, but the rest are slow and depressing. i've only listened to the clips, but this will definitely not be on my 'buy' list. sorry to all you fans out there."
2,Billy's growing up,"Billy Gilman's certinaly growing up. You can tell by his voice change. But his singing's just as good, if not better, than his original CD ""One Voice"". I hope that he stays true to his country roots and sing country songs."
4,Billy Gilman: The next chapter.,"What more can I say but ""Wow!"" This Billy Gilman disk shows both maturity in his voice - I have his first 2 CD's from a few years ago as well - and the same great quality in the songs. I was very curious and excited when I found this CD to hear what his voice sounded like now. I was not disappointed, and I don't think other fans and listeners will be, either."
5,Wow - The Voice of an Angel is BG,"I think that this album only proves that Billy Gilman is only going to get better. His mature voice is pleasant to the ear, especially during AWAKEN THE MUSIC...WOW! What a song, what a wonderful marriage. I can only say that it definitely owes it's essence to QUEEN (the rock group). I can't believe this song even exists on the album; what a delightful surprise. I have to say that it is definitely the best song on this album. The electric guitars are great. It is only natural for us, his fans, to evolve along with this great artist. I can only see a great future for him with his new voice. Welcome back Billy, but to me, you never left, you just grew up a little, letting your voice mature and grow into the great sunflower that it now is. Waiting for your next album. For now, I'll enjoy this great album."
2,Dissapointed,I've heard so much about the book I figured I'd have to get it. When I finally read through it I was dissapointed to find no new info and cheap hand drawn illustration. For anyone who wrenches on a large assortment of bikes I recommend the Hanes Manual on Mountain bikes. It has blow by blow pictures just like their car manuals and it's cheaper.
2,"Not good for ""mechanically challenged"" people","I admit it. I am a clutz when it comes to mechanical things. Because of this lack of talent, I need lots of photos and illustrations for me to get through any sort of repair work. Zinn has a book that will appeal to those who are mechanically adept, but as for the novice or individuals like me who lack spacial relations, the book will be very confusing. Much of the book describes, in words, what you should do instead of showing you in a step by step way with photos. ""Take the gibetz ring off of the whatchamacallit and be careful not to put tension on the g-string..."" This sentence wasn't in the book, but it might as well have been. I found this book to be very hard to understand."
5,Love to mountain bike,This book was excellent! The author seems to have a lot of knowledge and a little humor goes a long way. I have two bikes a hardtail that's pretty old school and a current full suspension which the book cover in depth. Love it and I did recommend it to all my friends.
5,great value!,Lots of pictures & easy to understand language. Diagrams are detailed. This bookneeds will helphave save money onfor simple bike maintenanceand &I repairs! Great for a newbie like me!
5,Wow!,"It's all I can say. Wow. When I got my bike I was pracitcally afraid that I was hurting it by holding the handlebars wrongly. Now I've had my headset and derailleurs apart, tune my derailleurs in a snap, have trued my wheels including one that seemed hopelessly out of round, and have everything on the bike dialed to fit me perfectly. This book includes a great appendix on bike fit. If you own a mountain bike you should own this book."
4,"Still the best guide, but ...","If this the first Zinn MTB maintenance guide you buy, you'll find tons of useful info. If you own the previous version, you'll see most of the material remains the same. The major (and welcome addendum) is the inclusion of rear shocks. However, few models are covered. For front shocks, there is still major and extended references to old forks, which I am in doubt if people still use them, and superficial reviews for new ones. There are a few new items added like tuning rear shocks, Stan Notubes, slime, tubeless etc - but this info is readily available in web sites. Overall I give this book 4 stars average - five if this is going to be your first copy, three if you have already one."
3,Good book but over-rated,"I think that this book is over rated for 2 reasons. First, the pen and ink type illustrations are not as useful as photos, which the book does not have. Second and more importantly, good how to / fix it books explain how stuff works. If you know how it works, you can diagnose most problems and fix them. By contrast other books (incl Zinn) mostly just tell you the steps to fix something. This is great as long as your gear and problem perfectly match the one the authors intended, but not so good for having to diagnose other problems (or fix stuff in the field where you don't have the book). Based on these criteria, I prefer Mel Alwoods book, although I usually read both before attempting a repair."
5,Excelent content,Excellent book full of information about MTB parts including differences from one brand to another. Full of drawings that helps understand how things should be done.
5,A Book for All,"This is an excellent book. It is explained simple enough that even a novice can understand, and learn, how to do everything from adjusting rim brakes, to adjusting bearings everywhere, and even bleeding hydralic brakes, if that is your cup of tea.It is in depth enough that if you already have some experience repairing bikes, that it can give you some pointers you may never have thought or heard of."
2,Where are the step-by-step photos?,"This is not a bad book. It is huge and quite comprehensive and probably has a solution for every problem. But where are the step-by-step photos that is much needed in a how-to book esp in the realm of bike repair! There are not even photos in color or b/w. The reader is forced to comprehend the ""art"" by some simple cartoon drawings?! Mountain bike repair is not exactly a simple thing to pick up for the normal person and the lack of photos make it even harder. Lastly, it is not a book you would want to read cover-to-cover. Granted, books like these are more for reference, but the writing is not even that great for the cover-to-cover attempt."
2,"Could be better, mediocre value","It's a thick book but yet I find it lacking in many procedures, seems like about 50% (or more) of the time I have an issue I can't find it and end up going online. I have a pretty good grip on basic maintenance so I use this as a reference manual and it just doesn't deliver, I would try the Parks book before this one."
3,Could be thinned out a bit,"Seems like there is a bit too much fluff.EDIT: but, the hand drawn illustrations are far superior to photos when you need to show bolt and washer stacks for say, hubs."
1,Thoroughly Lacking,"This reference is consistently bad. Please Zinn, just stop. I swear, every time I have tried to use this manual, I have not been able to complete the task. I have degrees, I have read my share of books, but rarely have I come across something this useless. Take it from a paying customer, buy something else, anything else. Use the internet, its free. For god's sake, just use youtube."
4,A must have for your mountain bike,"Whether you have a shiny new mountain bike or one that has been on more than a few trail rides, this book is a must to have in your collection. For about [price] and the price of some tools you'll be able to perform the most common maintenance on your bike yourself. Not only will this save you money (tuneups aren't exactly cheap these days), but you'll understand your equipment much better and be able to handle unexpected situations on the trail.The book is a large format with two columns of text per page and hand drawn figures (basically no photos). Each part of the bike is covered in great depth in pseudo-outline form.The only downside is that the figures can be a bit difficult to understand. I can see how they can be more clear that photos, but some combination of the two or perhaps just more figures would have helped. I've found it is always best to look at the figures alongside my bike so there is no ambiguity."
3,Very advansed.,This book is probaly very good but it is way over my head as a beginner working on my own bike. I will stick with it and try to learn as I go.
1,Potentially useful book ruined by poor writing or editing style.,"For me, this book died during its Prologue. After a couple of pages, I started noticing more and more instances of poor grammar. From then on, until I tossed the book aside at the end of Chapter 2, I was constantly distracted by grammar issues to the point where they caused me to steadily lose interest in any technical merit the book may have.The author mentions his website [...] as a place to find related information, and to contact the author. However, he has abandoned this URL, and a ""For Sale"" page is now displayed. Nice.Although I am only an interested amateur in the subject matter covered in this book, I served as a Senior Technical Editor for McGraw-Hill, Inc. for over ten years, and therefore feel qualified to express my above opinion."
3,Good for a party,"These chopsticks are ok. I do like all the colors that it has, but the finish on the chopsticks makes them really slippery. They are not like the chopsticks you use in restaurants. I would recommend them for a party or one time use, but I'm still on the lookout for better chopsticks."
1,Warped and Crooked,8 out of 10 of the chopsticks in my package were severely warped. Very disappointed. Would not buy again.
4,hhhhhhhmmmmmm,this book is really funny and a good collectible but it took me about 45 minutes to read it. it is really funny and like all the other spike milligan books its mad!!!! it has got a mix ofpoems animals and a storie. this is a great book but i wonder why nobody is reviewing it(probably busy reading the book over and other again. If i could i would giv this book a 4 AND A HALFbut you can't do that.buy it trust me u wont be dissapointed.
4,Good Book,"i really like this translation of the New Testament. it is very easy to understand and reads like a novel. the division into these short ""15 Minute"" sections are a great incentive for me to read it every day. to have someone elses commentary along with the text, helps to inspire my own thoughts and insights. i also like the references to the old testament, and i frequently look up those scriptures to gain a better understanding. this little book makes a great gift. i can only recommend it."
3,Romain Slocombe makes it worth it.,"This book is a collection of interviews of prominent figures in the global underground art culture. Some of these include Lydia Lunch and Mark Hejnar. The interview that makes this book stand out, however is French filmmaker and photographer Romain Slocombe. His 1993 photobook Broken Dolls (Kowasareta Ningyo) is one of the seminal works in the fetish photography genre of braces and bandages. The interview features several selections from his works, as well as discussions of his films and performance art. Overall, the book is interesting, but a little tedious."
5,"What's Inside You, Brother?","Never Drank the Kool-Aid is full of virtuoso performances, but the reason you must buy it and read it is ""What's Inside You, Brother?,"" a personal essay in which Toure invents a first person narrator to describe a third- (and, for nearly half the essay, a second-) person Toure as he tries on a new persona, making himself over as a boxer not unlike Sonny Liston, well-acquainted with ""the body English of the back alley, the backroom, the back corner of the prison's back cell."" And even as he remakes his body into something lean and strong and fast, he is grappling with notions harder to pin down: blackness and whiteness, poverty and privilege, who I am and who they say I am. No one, not David Remnick, not Joyce Carol Oates, not Gay Talese, has ever written better about boxing, and boxing's not even Toure's main concern."
5,"Refreshing, honest and realistic look at urban culture...",I was entertained from the first page. I thought I knew Toure' but now I understand so much more. I want to hear more stories. Please keep writing!!!!!
4,Better quality than a paper filter.,"This Fram Airhog filter is definitely a better quality filter than Fram's entry-level paper filter. I can see the better breathing potential in the Airhog due to its construction and, if cared for as prescribed, it seems it will last long. I don't know how this compares to similar type filters available such as those offered by K&N, Accel, etc. The only complaint I have is that the inner circumference of this particular Airhog filter is larger than its paper-made counterpart and fits loosely around the throttle body. I don't know why this is, but I figure I'll deal with it because it was an inexpensive, although discontinued, product and I don't want to deal with the return procedures."
4,Good Guide,"This is a very complete guide to prepare for the TExES test. They cover a lot of area and have great depth. There are some minor mistakes in the book - typos and fragmented sentences, so you really have to focus when reading. I passed the test using only this guide and studying from it for about 2 months. I would suggest to anyone that this is a great buy."
5,Still working,"I've reviewed this item before. I had purchased it when the seasons changed to try to avoid bringing home any bugs to my daughter who has Leukemia. I think it is working. I'm staying illness-free even when I feel like something is coming on, it seems to pass. Good stuff."
5,FANTASTIC Shackleton bio,"I'm a bit of a Shackleton buff but have struggled to find the right book to introduce him to my daughter. After several disappointments, we found ""Trapped By the Ice."" It is terrific! I highly recommend this book - have given several copies as gifts."
1,Ridiculous,"The method suggested by the creator of this product described is ridiculous. To ""play"" guitar in this fashion requires just a little more musicianship than it takes to ""play"" your ipod. Please."
2,"Film seemed old, lacked good color and clarity","Color was very poor. The beauty of Hawaii could not really be seen. It looks as if it was filmed in the 80's. Definitely not even close to HD. Was slow and boring. Very disappointing as I like documentary type movies, but this one was not it."
5,I Can't Believe Its Not Available,There is no doubt that all of the Callanatic exercise videos are simply the best and most effective tapes (not) on the market today. Someone's not paying attention. Check out ebay; old tapes are selling for mega bucks. These things should be reissued on DVD's. The sooner the better.
1,major disappointment,"You will have paid for an informercial - fully half of this video is a pitch for the whole series. the exercises are very good, but only briefly demonstrated, then you're left on your own to do them...You could do as well with a book. Given the amount of advertising you have to put up with, they should sell this for 50 cents a copy. Deservedly out of print!"
4,Beginning Callanectics VHS,Beginning Callanectics VHS. The VHS came the day after the DVD arrived. I promptly sat down and tried to watch it. It kept stopping and ejecting after about 20 minutes into the tape it folded up on itself. but from what I saw I enjoyed the exercises greatly. As soon as I get more energy I will try what I saw.
4,Comentarios What Do You Want from me?,"Muy recomendable pero sólo para los fanáticos de este grupo o de New Order o Joy Division.Es un disco que trae 3 versiones del single y un tema adicional.Muy rescatable la versión instrumental del tema, como nevedad.Pero repito, muy recomendable pero sólo para los fanáticos de este grupo."
5,Love Her Voice,"Really like her voice. Very differant, smooth with a lot of feeling. Would have loved to have heard her in person in one of her shows."
2,jasmine,"recieved this plant yesterday and it is in good health, but it is really small. if you are thinking of making a hanging basket, i would suggest purchasing at least six of these babies."
5,Happy Camper,"I must admit that I had my doubts about how well a plant can be shipped across the U.S. and survive. So I was pleasantly surprised to receive my night blooming jasmine in almost perfect condition. I did discover a couple of broken branch tips but other than that, the plant looked fine. It had been well watered prior to shipping and the broken tips soon re-sprouted new tips and is growing well. I can't wait for it to begin flowering."
3,Not sure what light it needs,"I got this plant in good condition and bigger than I thought. The label says full sun and it got sunburnt when I put it out. I've put it since in partial shade, but I noticed it still has yellow spots on all the leaves. I have to do some research if it's the sun or there's a pest. It's growing pretty fast though, but no blooms yet."
4,Night Blooming Jasmine Plant,"I received the plant in a timely manner. The plant was packed in a secure package with two 4 inch plant pots. After receivng, I immediately planted the plants using Miracle Grow Plant/Vegetable grow plantng soil. They are being watered twice daily, since there has been no rainfall. The plants don't seem to be growing much, but appear to be doing well. There are a few months to go before the end of the ""growing"" season, and I hope the plant will grow heartly to produce a nice and fragrant plant. At, this point, it is still too early to tell.An update to the above: The plant grew well, but being in Ohio with a short growing season, it only grew about 4 feet. It does bloom and gives off a really nice fragrance of jasmine. I am happy with the purchase!"
2,Only lasted a few months,"I was really excited to receive this plant since a lot of the reviews said it was wonderful. However, that was not the case for me. When I received the plant most of it's leaves had broken off during the shipment. It then continued to grow but would lose the leaves it grew within a few days. Eventually it had turned into just a stalk. Later found out it had bugs which had moved to my other plants. Tried replanting into new soil to rid the bugs and during the process it died. Would have loved to have this plant but it didn't work for me. I think mine was too young/new and during shipment it was just damaged to a point where it couldn't make a recovery."
3,Never bloomed and I killed it,I don't live in a good climate for this plant. I followed all the directions but couldn't get it to bloom. I took it inside when it started getting below 45 degrees F but I managed to kill it. It did live for 6-8 months before dying however.
2,High hopes,"I knew this was a small plant but I was not expecting a single rooted cutting. I ordered a gardenia with this and it arrived lush and in perfect condition. This arrived frost burnt and squished. There is still a viable stem and good root system so I am confident I can get it to survive, but I would not order it again."
4,Still living after 9 months,"Still living after nine months. It was pretty small when i ordered it. Did not grow much all during summer last year but after bringing it indoors for winter in NJ, it has really started to grow well. Cant wait till summer for it to bloom."
1,Sick,"Arrived sick looking as a one-and-half stem plant. In spite of my TLC eventually died. Had seen similar comments prior to buying it, but, unfortunately, ignore'em. Please do not waste your money!"
2,"Scrawny Withered, Feeble, Sickly Plant Nub","Granted it is a cold winter and challenging to ship a live plant,the posted reviews about the quality of shipping procedures andmature plants encouraged my purchase.Really, the plant wasn't packaged well - just a matter ofmoving inventory and recording sales. A sad plant in a plasticbag, with an old chemical hand warmer included more for appearancethan effectiveness (they last for hours not days) stuffed into a boxwith angel turds.The plant wasn't quite d.o.a. but more like in the throws ofcardiac arrest.Save your money, buy seeds and germination materials instead."
1,Quick Death,"I received 2 apparently healthy plants, which I immediately planted, watered and talked to. Both were dead within a month. I have grown night blooming Jasmine in the past with no problems. I contacted the seller and have received no response."
1,Waste,Plants died they are bad cheap sick plants waste waste of money and your time plant companies don't stand behind plants
1,Didn't work for me,"I bought this plant three months ago, potted it, watered it, kept it in the sunshine and..... nothing at all. Just an ill looking green plant with no blossoms and no aroma."
5,Nail Polish - fine but with shipping = $13.00?,I knew which nail polish I wanted and am completely satisfied with the product. It's unfortunate that a $3.50 (approx) bottle of nail polish actually cost me $13.00 with shipping charges!
1,Wrong color for cotton candy,"I recently ordered the cotton candy #77, have ordered before, the color is hot pink not close to the color on the screen and what i'm use to, the pearly soft pink color. if you send products you should make sure the color is true to represent what is shown for customer satisfaction."
1,"sent wrong product....cotton candy polish is a pearly, irredescent color...not hot pink.","You sent me the wrong product. Cotton candy is a pearly, irredescent color, not hot pink.I ordered 2 bottles of it and you sent me 2 hot pink colors.It looks like nothing in the picture posted.The picture looks pearly white."
1,error in reviews.,"The two previous 'reviews' seem to be for some other production. I haven't seen the dvd but saw this movie in the late 70's, one of the best from that period as I recall. Also, there are apparently packages out there that have a different movie inside."
3,Not too bad,"The title is a little misleading-- the end result of reading this book won't be compelling fiction, it'll be better than winging it though. His ideas don't drill home unless your desperate for advise on writing. There's nothing in this book that can't be taught in another, except maybe for his reccommended reading list in the back. I don't want to sound like I'm insulting the book, however, because it does provide useful information on writing and publishing, but I've read better."
5,David Crow is a genius!,David Crow plays with the maturity of an aged-veteran and the energy and dexterity of a young man. He has played for the Osborne Brothers and is known to make the occasional appearance at clubs and law schools in the Nashville area. This album showcases his wide range of ability and is a must-have for any fan of great fiddle-work.
3,tech problems,"The music and performance is very good. Themes are well performed. De Marcos is very good putting together musicians.I got two copies of the DVD/CD, and both DVD's has problems...they stop for a fraction of a second several times. It is no a major issue but it is not what you expect when you buy a DVD."
4,Very good Guide Book,This book covers all the civil war sites in Virginia and goes into detail about each battle covered. It is a great guide book for the civil war enthusiast visiting Virginia.
3,not what it looks like,This is a good product but it looks different online then when you actually receive it. Dont know how to describe it. I am not entirely disappointed but I just expected something different.
1,"Gustav Becker Clocks, A Guide to Identification & Price",TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. If you want to look for pictures of old Beckers this book is for you. If you want anything useful to find what kind of a clock you have look elsewhere:-(
2,my thoughts on the locker 1+2,"If you like asian horror movies, then this is definitely watchable. It is entertaining if you like that sort of stuff. The plot is pretty typical. This one involved a locker where if you put a love letter in it to someone then you will experience true love or something like that. Turns out the locker is cursed by a vengeful dead girl and anyone who gets involved with it dies. Similar to the story of the grudge but instead of a house it is a locker. This movie is watered down compared to a lot of the other stuff i've seen. If you want a really deep plot and a real sense of creepiness or unease then this is not the movie for you. I suggest you check out the one missed call movies, ab-normal beauty, silk, witch board (Bunshinsaba), ringu, ju-on, the eye, or reincarnation."
2,the locker deffinately was a dissapointment!!,"ok this film was a huge dissapointment mostly because it had sooo much promise in the beggining and then basically died at the end as though they were running low on time and just threw in a stupid ending in order to get the film done and over with. throughout the film i was for the most part impressed and left guessing by the story line as though they were going to tie everything together, but at the end they killed the whole movie because they quickly and uncreatively tied everything together. my recomendations, watch the beginning, skip the end and make up ur own!!!"
3,Freaky,"This double feature is interesting. Even though the film appears low quality, the story is interesting and some of the effects are pretty eerie. I enjoyed the exotic setting and the glimpse of Asian folk lore. There are a few parts that give you chills.It's not as dark or high quality as some of the others I have seen(A Tale of Two Sisters, Ringu, One Missed Call, Ju Rei), but will keep you entertained. I will admit that it does contain some cheesy parts.I don't recommend this type of movie for viewers interested in the high special effects of American or western films. Instead, this is for viewers who enjoy the story and peeks into other cultures."
5,Totally Awe Inspiring Debut Novel,"WOW! All I can say is this was a great debut novel! It captured me from the first words, the first page. I read it in 1 1/2 days. I couldn't help but enjoy Cady's fiery personality. And once I found out what made Keren act the way he did, you couldn't help but sympathize and fall in love with his character. They were perfect together. And the supporting characters were definitely memorable and people you hope to read more about in Mrs. Hubbard's future novels. This was a story that at times left me in tears and at others times had me LOL. I truly enjoyed Mrs. Hubbard's writing style, her attention to detail and her ability to make me feel as if I was watching a live performance. A Definte MUST READ!"
5,Little Man Clarence!!,"When I read a romance I expect to fall in love and I did. Cady the Volcano and Keren the Iceberg are F-A-B-U-LOUS!!BUt my favorite character was little badd-a** Clarence, Cady's nephew.Every family has a Clarence, and little details like that are what make Suddenly You so good."
5,Keep Them Coming!,I bought this book and spent the day reading it. Ms. Hubbard drew me into each character especially Cady and Keren. This is a very good storyline. This is a great read for people who believe in living life to the fullest and for people who need to learn how to live life to the fullest. I look forward to more books from this author.
3,ho hum.,"I put 20x80 binoculars for viewing astronomy. It does the job, but its max height is not tall enough for the average man. Short of 6' and you need astronomy bino tripods to be the height of a man and rated at 3x the mass of your binos. These don't quite cut it. But their price is good, that keeps it from being a 2 star. I've traveled with these without a special case, just a suitcase. Part of the tripod broke and I had to wire it back, so it doesn't travel well. If you are looking for astronomy tripods, look elsewhere."
2,Not the Greatest :-(,"This tripod was purchased for use with high power celestial binoculars. The quality is so-so; they move and when using binoculars of this magntitude, even the slightest movement is problematic. I don't know how they'd be for other applications."
3,Broke rather easily,This did not fit on the treadmill that I have so I set it on the coffee table and was getting ready to decide what to do with it when one of the cats knocked it over. Just falling from the coffee table it got a huge crack and part of it broke off.
4,blowin bluegrass,"Bluegrass harp players are hard to come by and good ones even harder. This work by George Thacker is a masters guide to classic bluegrass harp playing. He is backed by a quality no frills tight b-grass group. His playing and arrangements are to be studied by any harp player wanting to make the move from blues to bluegrass. This album is a beginning in the effort to legitimize the harmonica as a soulful, joyous and authentic bluegrass instrument."
1,Worse than the old one it replaced -- don't bother,"I bought this battery to replace the original one that came with my cell phone. The ""new"" one holds a charge a shorter time than the old one does! I have to charge it every day, whether I use it or not. I feel ripped off, to tell you the truth."
3,Equity Markets - Quantitative Analysis,"The monograph is useful for investment professionals seeking to develop quantitative models of equity performance or to understand the performance of those models. Proves that the ""drivers"" of above-index returns differ between markets and differ over time. Clearly written good exposition with interesting references, but are YOU really interested in the subject?"
4,Lyra2 gets the job done,"PROS:-perfect for a run or the gym as it has an FM tuner and does not skip (pretty much all mp3 players do not skip). I can't believe all mp3 players don't have a radio, too! (that is why I chose this one)-good controls, easy to figure out how to navigate songsCONS:-not as small as other mp3 players-speakers are over the ear type. sound is good, but can get annoying on the ears after an extended amt of time.-The software does not work on Windows XP, so be sure and upgrade the musicmatch software as soon as you install or your system will crash. I found the realjukebox software takes too long to get your mp3s onto the smartcard that goes into lyra.-Downloading music to the player takes a bit of time to learn. You cannot drag/drop onto the smartcard through windows explorer, rather you have to go through the musicmatch software."
1,Pathetic,"An incredibly poor amateur production that, based on its fire star rating, is being promoted by one of those responsible for creation. In fact the same individual is responsible for all the five start ratings for this embarrassing series which is an insult to the intelligence of Amazon.com customers, and the kiss of death to the reputation of its previously highly regarded author. ""Mastering Karate"" gives new meaning to the word pathetic."
3,Inside the turmoil of revolution,"It is 1989 & Aurea Cioban is a student at the University in Bucharest when she meets Maurice Calistrat, a young lieutenant stationed at a nearby military base. Soon a passionate love affair develops.Love, however, is not blind & a combination of jealousy, fatalism, & ambition begins to take their toll on the young couple's courtship.SHEPHERD wanders into a world of superstitions & deeply rooted beliefs, steeped in Romania's rich history of mysticism & folklore.Absorbing & intricate & everso sad."
4,Traditional Flamenco,"Album of traditional Flamenco by the guitarist Mario Escudero (wearing his Niño de Alicante aspect); Mario's wife Anita Ramos on castanets; vocalists Enrique Montoya and El Pili; and the dancer Mario Álvarez. I should guess it was probably recorded some time in the 1960s. There's also an uncredited 2nd guitarist, unless it's Mario double-tracked.Contents:01) Sevillanas02) Granadinas Noche granadina03) Bulerías de la Samaritana04) Fandangos05) Verdiales Torremolinos06) Zapateado de las campanas07) Seguiriya Los ojos míos08) Taranto Levante09) Danza Mora Danza egipcia10) Fandangos Temas de HuelvaIt's an atmospheric album. Tracks 4, 6 & 9 are instrumentals, with the Danza Mora being especially attractive.The total time is 38'01""."
1,What a piece of CRAP!!!,"I don't know where to begin. The acting is terrible, the story sucks. I made it to the end but almost shut it off. Thank God I only spent $1.00 rental on this one which was still too much. I can't believe they spent money filming this in 3D. Nothing like the Amityville Horror which blew this movie off the map. And to say this piece of crap is better than A Haunting in Conneticut you need your head examined. Pass this one by on your video rental shelves. You would get more enjoyment out of playing a game of checkers by yourself."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Do not waste your money. My husband, brother, and I laughed and joked about this movie the entire time. Just EVERY possible stereotype horror flicks tend to have. Just ridiculous. Silly. Stupid. Acting was just horrible. There was nothing about this movie that I could even say I liked, except for when it was over."
1,Horrible Movie and 3D,"The movie itslef was one of the worst ones I have ever seen, and I've had many..hehe...The 3d was horrible too, no wonder why this blu ray 3d was soo cheap."
2,Terrible film,Skip this one because it could have been better but it wound up being not so great. The haunting in Connecticut was much better.
2,Bad Casting,"This film has got to be the worst casting film I have ever seen.The lead role played by Bill Oberst Jr. is one of the worst actor's by far.Not only is he the most fuglyest actor but in the movie his wife is played by Courtney Abbiati witch is a little hard to believe.I just could not believe they could cast this lead role to such a bad actor as Bill Oberst Jr.The movie itself is good,but if I had to watch this guy in any other movie's I would want my money back"
2,Horrible,"This movie absolutely dissapointed me in EVERY way!!...bad acting, bad plot & the 3D was awful!..Why even waste your time making a 3D version to this horrible movie!!...it was not exciting in any way..3D is supposed to be exciting with alot of special effects...this movie had none!!I was expecting ghosts to jump out at me or something!..NOT EVEN WORTH WATCHING & DEFINATELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!"
3,Entertaining and ok 3d,"Ok there were PLENTY of holes in the plot,but the 3D and the scares kept me interested. As i've said on a number of my reviews...at least it is not expensive. For the bucks it costs,plus pretty good 3D,and a few chills,its worth adding to a 3D collection.Don't expect a horror classic,just expect pretty good 3D and a ok horror flick."
1,Dont waste your money,"Could have been a good story line, but bad directing and even worse acting really made this movie increadably bad. Just my oppinion, don't waste your money or time on this one."
3,Spooky Salem,"The movie was o.k.The previews were more scarier than the actual movie.The actor's & Actresses were ametures but overall is was a light scare on a night you don't want a BIG scare,lol."
2,Poor quality.,"Was not what I expected, the 3D was not good quality at all, it was the old fashion type of 3D, did not work with my 3D TV and my 3D glasses. Works on 2D with the old type glasses, but very poor picture quality. Sorry I bought it."
2,Lame Movie,"I have watched this 2 times in 3dAnd yes I thought I would give it a second chance , But yes like the first time I wasent impressed"
1,A Haunting in Salem (Blu-ray 3D),Low budget movie with unknown and armature actors. I was hoping for a scary horror movie and was extremely disappointed. Even the house pictured on this movies cover doesn't exist. If you want my advice don't waste your money.
3,Good B-movie,This is a great movie if you like to goof in a movie with friends who have a good sense of humor and at least a little intelligence. I had fun and quite a few laughs at the expense of Sherrif Hoggle(see Labarynth for reference). I gave it one less star to help dissuade those who might mistake this as having a budget large enough to be a blockbuster in disguise
3,A Haunting in Salem (BD3D),"If your fascination is in a good ""B"" spoof, regardless the resolution, 3D or not.Then this is tailor-made for you ...3D is 3D SO! You would be better off, watching something like.USA's circa 1980 & 90's ""Up All Night"" hosted by Rhonda Sheer & Gilbert Godfrey.And if by chance, you were more entertained by the host(ess).Then without any question, you will love this one.HAPPY VIEWING, from the *Lone Star State < Hook `em Horns >"
2,There's a reason it's out of print.....,"This is a decent game, though I can't believe people are trying to sell this for the amount they are. Let's list the good point... notice, singular, not plural.1) It's got Monopoly, Boggle, battleship, and Yahtzee....Now for the bad:1) No save feature2) limited gameplay without two copies of the game for multiplayer3) Boggle is missing so many words that it's overly frustrating to play4) Monopoly is near impossible to play due to the lack of a save feature5) It's out of print, so the real price of $20 which nearly makes it worth getting is gone.Bottom line is, don't waste your money and spend over the original $20 that this game cost. It's simply not worth the time or money to get a decent $20 title. Wait till either another printing of the game, or a better version is released.Hope this helps some of you who think this must be the greatest game out there."
2,Too buggy,"These games could be fun, but the cartridge is riddled with bugs. For instance, as you race to select letters in Boggle, about one in five of your stylus taps will be mis-registered, screwing up the word. You have to slow down, which misses the entire point of the game. This is the only DS game I've played that has any trouble telling where you've tapped.There are similar interface, gameplay, and AI glitches in all four games.Don't bother with this one -- your money is better spent elsewhere."
2,bugs,i have to say...i am disappointed. i found bugs galore in the boggle game. if i click on one letter it thinks i am clicking on a different one. it is really frustrating...yahtzee worked fine for me but overall the 4 games are not that great.
1,Terrible,"The developers have gone out of their way to make these games ugly and unpleasant to play.* Boggle - ugly, doesn't know some basic words* Yahtzee - ugly, but okay* Battleship - ugly, tedious, clumsy* Monopoly - okayFor example, when I say Boggle is ugly, I mean because they are using a 3D engine to render the cubes, and the letter forms do not look good in this mode - all mis-shapen. They should have used nice clean 2D graphics with aliasing to improve the apparent resolution.Trust me, save your money."
4,Very Good,"I was at Old Tucson when this movie was made! I thought subject matter good, fair acting. It was a TV movie and has become one that is very little known."
5,Sword of the North by Richard White,"My aunt gave me this book years ago and it has disappeared. I looked here and discovered it was out of print but was able to get a used one!! The book is about my ancestor, Henry Sinclair, whom my aunt traced when doing geaneology work many years ago. I am SO thankful to have found it!"
3,I guess it works but this is the wrong one.,"Either Bosch or Amazon messed up their descriptions for my car. I'm sure for other cars this is the right number but it said this is the downstream one but it's actually the upstream for my civic.It did turn the check engine light off but I'll have to see if it will pass emissions like this. If it does, I'll give it a 4 star rating. If not, then I'll be returning it."
4,Fits and works fine for my accord 1998 V6 coupe,Fits and works fine for my accord 1998 V6 coupe. initially had to reset the OE sensor check engine like again but after that it worked fined. Good price and fit. Just watch out for the longer wires which was not a problem with the included plastic ties.
2,whistiling o2 sensor,i bought this o2 sensor installed it. but it keeps making a squelling noise and if i touch it while running. it stops. whats the gareenttee?
1,Junk product - defective upon installation,"I think the title says it all. My car code was pulled saying this sensor was a problem. I bought this sensor and installed it. Code still came up, so did some more digging electronically. Turns out, the sensor is still the problem, all the wiring is fine. I don't have hours and hours of free time, so I didn't get to this within the 30-day window for getting defective products replaced by Amazon. Apparently, the products they sell only are guaranteed to work for 30 days, not 75 days.Long story short, don't buy Bosch, and don't forget to read all the fine print with Amazon. I will deal with neither ever again if I can at all help it."
1,New & Improved? NOT,"I have access to Peterson's original book (older than me?) and to the first edition of this one, published in 1974. I recommend buying used copies of the old ones. They contain the same info and are easier to use since the charts are bigger."
4,Very Helpful,I purchase this book for a little more insight of the 4 gospels... It has been very helpful and acknowledging. It has help me understand more the life and purpose of Christ and hove we are to learn more and cherish each day the purpose of the sacrifice of Jesus. And that we are to live a holy life and be a born again Christian to be able to go to heaven. Being a born again Christian is to leave the ways of the world and live a spiritual life.... The Bible is our guide to a spiritual living.
5,Real healing,"Laurel Elizabeth Keyes takes you through the long history of toning as used by healers, shamen and priests from many ancient cultures. She then explains very clearly how to tone for yourself and for others. After just the first try I felt fanatastic, and have continued to do so! This is a very practical, easy to understand book with lots of sound advice - no pun intended! I thoroughly recommend this for anyone searching for their own wellness, relief from pain, healing for themselves and others or personal development."
3,Northern Industrial Mortising Attachment review,"The Attachment appears to be solidly built and was easily assembled on my Ryobi DP101 drill press just from the pictures. It produced clean mortises from the first time I used it.The Operation Manual was accurate and clearly written.Suggestions - 1 - The attachment is supposed to be removable. A knob or lever would be preferable to the hex nut supplied to tighten the chisel holder on the quill.2 - Metal split ring bushings instead of the plastic ones supplied. I'm nervous about tightening the nut on the chisel holder for fear of breaking the plastic bushing.3 - Flexible leaf springs instead of the rigid curved rods supplied to hold the workpiece against the fence; the sides of the workpiece may not be smooth or parallel.4 - Redesign the case so that each bit has its own fitted slot. My bits came in cardboard boxes squeezed in between the other parts in the case.In summary, a good hobbyist tool which I would recommend to other woodworkers.Edward Beckles"
2,Not the best Quality,"The mortising attachment as a whole works well with my General Industrial drill press. However, the mortising chisels are poorly designed and cannot handle hard woods like sugar maple. The mortising chisels have what appear to be a ""dome"" design (instead of the traditional ""cone"" design) which compresses the wood and does not push it toward the auger bit when drilling. The points are soft and actually bend inward when trying to penetrate hard woods. The price is low but unfortunately the overall quality and usability is also low."
4,Liked it!,Received from Northern tool in good shape. Instructions were OK. Fitment to an old bench drill press went smoothly. All in All a good buy.
3,It's Okay,"I like the fact that I can use this in the oven or microwave, because microwave food sometimes is not so appealing. However these are not so good for freezing. The lids don't fit so securely, no matter how many times I put them on, and my food gets freezer burn constantly. But for reheating there very nice."
2,Oops!,"I didn't realize that the lids were not microwave safe, only the dish is. Now I have a TV dinner plate with no lid. I guess it was my mistake, but who would have thought they wouldn't make a microwavable lid? I found a better set of plates for a lot less. I just can't recommend this product."
5,Works For Me,"Although a little small, it holds my meal. If the lid gets a little loose, put a rubber band around it. Won't freeze, works great and can hold a post it note of the contents"
3,Microwave Plate,"There's not much more that I can say about this than what's already been said by other reviewers, except to say that the actual INSIDE dimensions of this plate are 8 1/8"" X 6 3/8"" X 3/4"" Deep. And like other reveiwers, I agree that you'll need to use a rubber band or 2 to hold the lid on. I own a lot of microwaveware by this company and this just isn't up to their former standards -- if you're looking for a little entree plate this will do, just don't tip it or you'll end up with everything mixed together."
1,whoops it spilled,"This is good for keeping foods in the refrigerator, but is not very reliable when taking it to work for lunch. The food spills and gets all mixed up"
3,Smaller Than Expected,"I agree with one of the other reviewers that this plate is small. It does the job, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone with a hearty appetite."
5,What can I say?,"Christine Caine is not only an amazing speaker, but also has a gift for writing. With her book ""Undaunted,"" she takes us on her own personal journey where she found the courage to let go of her past and move forward with the call God had for her life. This book is a great read for anyone at any level in life. Christine uses God's Word and her past (including adoption and sexual abuse) to share how the reader can overcome and answer the call that God has for their lives. This book is inspirational, and yet it also encourages application. After reading Christine's book, it's clear that we must press forward with our walk with Christ. We cannot stay stuck in the past. Christine pulls the reader in with this book, and she only releases the reader when it is time for the reader to continue onward on his or her own journey to answer the call God put forth for their own lives."
5,Love the book!,"Great book, awesome author, and perfect timing on shipping! Christine Caine writes from the heart and her books are very encouraging. Definitely a must read!"
5,Inspiring book from an inspiring speaker,"Really enjoyed this book! Even though I have heard some of her stories preached before, reading them in Undaunted made it more personal and took the message to a whole other level. This book will change many lives."
4,Good read!,"Our Church's ""Sisterhood"" studied this book and video series and found it to be an edifying and uplifting account of ""when life gives you lemons...make lemonade"". God has equipped us to do just that! Christine Caine shares it from a very personal place."
4,Good Read,"After hearing Christine Caine speak on a couple of occasions, I bought the book. It is a great read! I recommend it for anyone needing an extra push to live surrendered to God."
4,Helpful and inspiring,"The opening was the most gripping part of the book. Following that I found some very solid information and reminders about what God wants for our lives. The format was anecdotal and sprinkled with insight and application, although I found it a bit choppy. Overall a very good book well worth the read. It's the kind of book one finishes and then says not only ""What can I do?"", but then steps out with confidence knowing that God has plans for each of our lives if we dare to be undaunted."
5,eyeswideopen,"This is a fantastic book; a real eye-opener. Having grown up in the mountains away from large cities, I have been protected from the real world. After reading ""Undaunted"", I am determined to become more involved with people in our society who have not been so protected, through working with the local women's resource center, pregnancy resource center, and any other group dedicated to helping people who are struggling."
4,Left me wanting more,"As good as a book this book is, it left me wanting more. I was so moved by Christine's work in the anti-trafficking organization, A21, that I wanted to read more about what she does and how she does it.The book opens with her talking with a group of girls rescued from the sex trade. When one girl asks why she did not come sooner, Christine reflects on what brought her here. The next 120 pages, Christine gives her back story. There is so much to her back story, that I forgot where she was going. In some ways, the back story was too long. By the time, she circled back to her work with A21, the book was almost over.Her life is interesting, and her many analogies are based on Biblical truth. The book is just too long on back story and too short on her current mission. Even still, her story brings hope to many.Zondervan provided me a free copy of this book in exchange for my review which I freely give."
4,Very good,Challenges us to do the work God calls us to and she reminds us how we have been equiped to do so.
5,Great book!,"Christine Caine is a wonderful speaker, very passionate and interesting to listen to or read. This book is terrific and ignited passion in me to listen closer to what God tries to lead me to do, instead of trying to lead myself to do what I want to do."
1,Continuing in a Craptacular Direction,"Richard Morel and his band ""Morel"" continue to churn out lyrically vaccuous, sample-heavy electrono-rock that desperately wants to be Depeche Mode for the current day. Not only does Morel have absolutely nothing to say, he has a (barely) three-note range singing voice and seemingly no actual musical ability. Great electronica comes from artists who create their own fabulous samples with their own instrumental skill. Morel simply pulls out stacks of ""DJ Loops!"" pre-made discs and cuts and pastes together a mural of boredom. His live performances are even more tedious, as he stands in the middle of the stage in a loosely fitting suit and drones like a sugar-free honeybee. An absolute MUST-AVOID!"
3,Fatal flaw,"I had to bring this boombox back because it has a fatal flaw. The radio tuner stops on every radio station! That means if you want to reach 107.7, you must start down at 80 and press the button at least twenty times - stopping at each station. Once you program the presets this is less of an issue, but do you want to always have to rely on the presets and remote control? This is such a poor design it's hard to believe."
5,Rachmaninoff,"This film by Tony Palmer shows performances of Rachmaninoff's works by Valery Gergiev and others. It includes scenes of a Rachmaninoff museum, and places where he lived in Russia. It recounts historical events, his travels and concert tours, and interviews with some of his grandchildren. Best of all it shows many home movie segments where Rachmaninoff is cavorting, smiling, and showing an intimate and surprisingly lighthearted side. Sir John Gielgud gives voice to Rachmaninoff's letters and reminiscences about his life. I don't see how anyone could watch this wonderful film, and not come away loving Rachmaninoff more than ever."
4,"Good performances, dubious modern-day material","I agree with the person giving the DVD a one star rating and talking about mockery of the ""motherland"". While the performances are good and I WOULD buy this DVD again, the footage of modern-day Russia is very misplaced and does not add, rather detracts from one trying to get a sense of Rachmaninoff's Russia and I feel should have been left out. Footage of Rachmaninoff himself however has been extremely interesting to see.I did not find the narration to be very informative. In conclusion, while the historical footage and the performances are excellent, modern-day Russia footage and narrative are disappointing and left me with a feeling that something was missing. I would've liked to learn more historical facts from Rachmaninoff's life, rather than just reading of his letters/diary, which are not always revealing. That's not to say they are uninteresting, just don't create a full enough picture."
3,"But for Gielgud, I'd have merited it only two stars","The voice of Sir John Gielgud alone made this DVD worthwhile for my money - plus some fascinating raw footage of this 6ft. 'scowl' and a few of the piano shots. But I was sorry that a man of Tony Palmer's caliber should bow to Hollywood-style gimmicks. The grotesque close-ups of Gergiev were particularly irritating and did a disservice to this great conductor. Why not a view from a few feet away for Heavan's sake, which would have much more effectively enhanced the drama of his interpretation. And the passe 1930's gimmick of soft-focussing the orchestra, bathing them in fuzzy light - hello! Maybe this is what film producers think today's public still wants, maybe it is! Ironically, in Rachmaninoff's own view of America: 'It is all about money.'"
1,Meaningless documentary,"Musical performances in this documentary can be rated from decent to excellent. However, their mapping to the different periods of Rachmaninoff's life is often meaningless. The worst parts are the visuals of modern Russia, that look like mockery of Rachmaninoff's love to his motherland."
1,SPOKEN LENGUAGES,THE SPOKEN LENGUAGES ARE JUST RUSSIAN AND ENGLISH. POEPLE WHO SPEAKS OTHER LENGAUGES CAN NOT UNDESTAND IT.
2,Good music but not impressive DVD,I bought this based on other reviewers' 5 star ratings.I was somewhat disappointed.
3,"Very cool movie, and the price point is nice!","I got a chance to view a screener copy of this movie, and I really enjoyed it. It's a solid story, that's quite original, with some solid acting in it. It IS a low budget flick and it shows, but at the same time you can see the good production values in it. It has some very funny and outlandish characters in it (especially writer/director Adam M) and it's entertaining from start to finish. With most small/no budget movies they're either SO BAD THEY'RE GOOD or just plain bad, and this one stands out from those. It's got good sound, was shot well, and the locations help to up the production values. It's definaly worth a rent, if not a buy (especially at amazon's price!)"
5,Mic stand,"This is a great stand for the money. Our venue wanted to charge $25.00 to rent a mic stand for the evening. Hmmm, do the math on that one! This was also sturdier than the rental mic stand.We will continue to use this for all events & certainly come out way ahead of the game."
4,Solid Stand-Great price,"What I love about this stand is the solid base - used it out live 2 days after purchase - no worries. Telescopic stand makes it easy to shove in a gig bag. The only drawback is having to unscrew and screw in base everytime I set up. Dont know how long the threads will last over time, but for the price u cant beat it."
5,super,GREAT quality especially for the price. You will need to purchase the actual plastic piece to put the mic in separate.
3,ok,"The first time we bought this the clip was broken and I had to buy a new one at the music store. We have only used this for the kids to play with, so it has served it's purpose."
3,Decent Stand for a Decent Price,"Bought this stand for my home karaoke set up. It sees a moderate amount of use, sometimes by inexperienced and slightly inebriated persons. Definitely a good buy for the price."
3,not bad for a while but broke,"Heavy microphone stand and pole, which is great to keep it upright, but the pole snapped off the base. We tried to epoxy it a few times but ultimately it pops off again."
3,Really tough to get the mic clip on this,I bought this stand in conjunction with the recommended mic clip only to find that the threading on the stand was faulty. My friend and I really had to force the clip into the stand in order for it to stay screwed on.
3,Grape not for me,"I would have loved it, but I really didn't like the grape flavor and I haven't tried any other flavors. I like grape flavor in some things but not this. I wished I had picked two flavors to compare them."
5,History of a Premier Fantasist,"Triskell Tales takes the reader through 22 years of chapbooks written, as gifts, for family and friends each year. The poems and stories vividly illustrate de Lint's development as an author. Even the very earliest pieces display a charm and simplicity that's simply delightful, without distracting from the quality of the later work. The writer's talented wife, MaryAnn Harris, has wonderfully illustrated this album of nostalgia and magic that is a MUST for all de Lint fans and readers of quality fantasy."
2,"The artists are the original artists, but the songs are not the original songs they sang when they first came out.",Most of the songs are not the version that first came out. Have to get use to the different version. Some are ok some I don't like.
5,Truly wonderful,48 of the greatest songs of the era. It 's a great blend of genres that can be used at a party to please everyone.
3,One Hit Wonders,"One Hit Wonders is a fair to good 3-Cd set. The only drawback is that some of the songs are not by the original artist. On a few songs, the tempo or beat of the music is also different from the original song. Otherwise, it is a worthy purchase."
1,One Hit Wonders - NOT! purchased from Amazon,"I don't know where they found these songs, but they are NOT the original songs by the ORIGINAL artists. I would almost pay someone to take this set off my hands. An extreme dissapointment, with NO FOREWARNING that these are not the original hits by the original artists. This is one of those remakes by one or more band members (supposedly) for each song. Don't waste your money on this as you surely will be very disappointed! Perhaps you should check out Dick Bartley's One Hit Wonder CD's."
2,Why not use the real songs,The songs are ALL re - recorded. It is still the original artists but the Arrangements are different. Too bad I was really looking forward to hearing these songs.
1,"Warning,Danger Will Robinson!","This is a bogus, deceptively advertised product. None of the songs are original recordings. They are poorly produced remakes and whatever company produced this dreck assumed that the buying public wouldn't be able to notice the difference in recordings or arrangements. Trust is a two way street. We trust the buyers of these products to be honest with us, the consumer. We trust that we are investing in a quality product. The only useful purpose for this CD is to balance a wobbly table leg."
1,I won't buy this,"but I have to say the title is completely misleading. Most of the artists listed had multiple top 40 hits. Paul Revere and the Raiders anyone? Archies? Len Barry, The Association, Animals, Lynn Anderson, Kim Carnes?"
1,Morons......,"Track 15, the title to the song is ""WENDY"". They list it as ""WINDY"". How can you trust anything when the label itself is flawed? The entire collection ranges from the early 60's to the late 70's.Oh, and then there is LEIF GARRETT. Who is he again???"
1,CD is a redo by one or more artists in the group not the original recordings.,"Well save your money this is one of those cd compilations that has been deone by one or more of the groups arists.To the un proven ear you might be fooled but side by side with the originals you can hear the difference,Save your money and buy the originals in other collections here on Amazon.It is very unfair that there is no mention of this to buyers before they spend there money on junk like this."
1,Not the originals,"I bit. I bought this and to my dismay found that the songs are not the original hit singles. Oh well, we get burned sometimes."
1,Amazon should not even allow this for sale on their site!,"Well, I guess if you buy alot of music (which I do), you're bound to get ripped off every now and then. But this could all be avoided if Amazon required some kind of warning for such obvious cheats as this set. This bunch of songs are truly pisspoor imitations. I couldn't find anything that would have warned me to save my money and steer clear. Hey Amazon---are you listening??"
1,Waste Of Money,"What a waste! These cd's are not what I thought I was buying. ""Indiana Wants Me"" is not done by the original artist. None of the songs are. It sounds like the person was on drugs or drunk. The original song has sirens. This version doesn't. I am not very happy. Very disappointed. PLEASE DON'T BUY!!!"
1,Not very good,"In this book only one view, that of driving a reefer, is highlighted. Almost no mention of flatbeds, car carriers, etc.Urban myths are used as facts such as getting shot by gangs when flashing headlights at them and techniques are mixed up. Gordon recommends using the stab technique when going down mountains. The correct technique is snubbing the brakes, totally different from stabbing them.The worst part is encouraging trainers to use students as a team to make more money for the trainer. This is a terrible way to teach. The trainer should never be in the sleeper when the student is operating the truck. The student gets a small salary for the week and the trainer gets paid for all the miles the truck runs. Very greedy IMO.There is some good advice in the book but the bad out weighs the good."
1,Not needed,"I bought this cable for use with the stereo DEH-4200UB, but I discover that I can use the normal Ipod cable without anything else. So it was just a waste of money."
5,"Yes, it's an IPOD cable but 10x better","Yes, you can just use a regular ipod cable, I tried several including an expensive Griffin. They all had the same problem, if you move your phone much, the charge feature will often disappear. With the pioneer cable, that problem went away. The fit is far better and more secure. If you don't care about charging, then you don't need a cable anyway, just use the bluetooth. This cable was worth the money, as it's far superior to any ipod cable."
1,wth?!?!,Wow!! this is a complete rip off it is shot as hell and over priced and not needed u can just use the one for the ipod or go to any wal-mart or electronics store and get another one for a 3rd of the price i thought the cord was needed for control over the ipod but its not!! DO NOT BUY!!
1,DONT BUY ANY PIONEER DEVICE IF YOU THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PLAY AND CHARGE YOUR NEW iPONE/iTOUCH,"I just learned that Pioneer does not make an iPhone/iTouch compatible USB cable, AT ALL!If you have an older ipod the folks at Pioneer have a decent product, but if you try any of the new Apple products you will be severely disappointed to learn that your device will not charge your newer (Post 2009) device.Don't waste your money, look elsewhere for another brand that is actually selling products for the 21st century."
3,2 meters!,"the description says (6 ft.)and yet what I got was not even a foot 1/2...but was needed because I kept getting error readings from the head-unit, so I figured I'd give the recommended hardware a use for the device."
1,No Good,"This Products does not work on the avhp5700dvd bought,it with thecd-ub100 and the screen says N/A and it doesn't work. Would not waste yourmoney on this."
1,too short! actually worthless to begin with,"should have looked thoroughly through the reviews from others that say this cable was very unnecessary to connect the ipod to the deck. It would have been a lot better if the cable was a long as an original ipod cable, just so it matches the dark interior of most vehicles. Other than that, there's no major issues with this cable, except it's very short and a waste of 21$"
5,iPod cable works,This works perfectly. I like the connector cover that protects the pins when not in use.
5,Plus to your car stereo,"I bought this item to connect my iPod with my car stereo. What I like the most is the color because you can hide it in your dash and it won't look funny when you have your iPod attached to it.Works very good, iPod lock system is easy to remove and connector cap avoids dust from getting into it.This device has enough cable distance to fit any dash of any car. If you want to use it as a backup for your original iPod connector, is great."
4,Must-buy!,"If you own an iPod and a compatible Pioneer head unit, this is an accessory you simply must purchase!I am using this with aPioneer DEH-P7000BT Receiverand aiPod Classic 120 GB (6th gen)and couldn't be happier with the added beneft of controlling my iPod directly from the receiver, all the while keeping my iPod charged.If I'm so happy, why did I only give it four stars? Because in my humble opinion ~$30 is practically highway robbery for a USB cable with an iPod head on one end. But if you own an iPod, you're probably already used to this superfluous markup on accessories.Apart from that, there really isn't much to say about this product- it is a cable, nothing more and nothing less. Be sure to check compatibility with the head unit and iPod you plan to use befre purchasing, just to be safe."
1,Waste of money,Overpriced and very short. Don't waste your money. Not needed with Pioneer radios. Just use any Ipod cable dor a third of the price.
2,Expensive iPod to USB cable...,"This is an overpriced Ipod to USB cable, if you need to connect your iPod to your radio, use any iPod cable and connect it to the radio's USB connectors.There is no sense on buying this cable if you can get other for half the money....the only 'plus' this cable has is the connector cover, but its not worth the high price..."
4,Works great,i just installed Pioneer DEH-7300BT it works great really like it a lot bluetooth works great on it. Waiting a cable for my Iphone 3gs use it a Ipod. I plug in in works great. The only thing is i wish that make the cable longer. I had to move my window mount / cell phone holder to center on my windshield.
5,a reader from MA,"This book is about an endearing relationship between a little girl and the willow tree outside her bedroom window. ""Hello Willow"" should spark the interest of anyone who has a child with a creative imagination that could make any inanimate object come to life. The simple and clever text is complimented by the beautifully amusing watercolor illustrations that help carry you through the story. The illustrations really make this book come to life. My children love this book and so will you. I recommend this book to anyone with a wildly imaginative child."
2,Seen Better,"I found the idea of the book to be good, but the execution was poor. The writing was weak and unimaginative. This could have been the beginning of a magical adventure but instead it turned out to be a very predictable read. I wouldn't recommend it to others."
2,"OK Premise, Not a Great Book","I'm in agreement with the reviewer who gave this a 2. Basically, I liked the premise but thought there wasn't anything really great or original about the book. It's OK, no one will be offended by anything. It just isn't a great book. I read it to my pre-school group and it didn't seem to grab them. The boys were throughly disinterested and the girls kept talking to each other. Oh, well. I have read other books that are fantasy/play themes that hold their attention better."
2,Disappointed.,"I was very disappointed with this book. Although the idea seemed promising, I'm afraid that the writing was unimaginative and predictable. It did not hold my daughter's attention and I finished the story by myself. The illustrations were alright. Overall, I wouldn't recommend the book to others. It's not a memorable effort."
3,"They look nice, But.....","These look pretty nice.. The coasters are nice and deep to avoid run-off. The main problem was the holding bases came bent, so I had to grab tools to try to straighten them up. It worked , so I am okay with them. Better Quality Control on products is always a good idea...."
4,Quality,"This is a fine looking product, and it will meet my needs. It is over priced. I would purchase more when it goes on sale or I have a coupon."
3,Coasters are nice but holder...,"These coaster are actually quite nice. The holder, however, is crooked and does not sit flat on my table. From reading other reviews, I'm not the only one that has had this problem."
4,Almost Perfect,"These coasters are great. The tops of them have rubber strips to stop your drink moving. The bottoms are rubber covered, too. They are aesthetically pleasing and will go with most decor. The only thing I don't like about them is the stand/holder that comes with the coasters. It does not sit flat, but rather tips a little bit. When I looked at the bottom of the stand to see why it wouldn't sit flat, there is a cut in the metal that has been poorly welded together. Annoying, but the coasters are still good value and do the job."
4,Heavy Duty,I really was pleased with the heavy duty quality of the aluminum/metal that they used for the base. I like the fact that the black portion was a rubber like material instead of plastic to hold onto glass better.
3,Not quite right,"No concerns here re the price of this item. The coasters are solid and seem well made. I like the look of the items. However, the ""stainless steel wire holder"" has 2 rough spots on the bottom which could scratch a table, and is bent. It does not sit level and is not symmetrical. I do not use the holder."
5,I luv em',"This coasters are bad-ass! heavy duty stuff, i dont know that the other guy saying that it had scratches all over it. as far as i can tell its the finish of the metal that has very fine scratches."
4,Coasters - Good Product,"Good product. There is little that can be said about coasters, other than that they work, and these certainly do."
2,Not the best,They look great and are OK if there is no condension. Wanted something to take water from the bottom of the glass as stoneware does. These coaster did not do it.
2,poorly made,"The coasters look nice, but they have many scratches on them. I think it is the way the made them. The rubber strips on top look as if they were glued to the top, then cut into strips with a knife. There are scratches that go along the rubber strips and off the end as if they cut down the length of it with s knife. Some of them were not even cut straight or still have little bits of rubber along the edges. I think whoever made them should have taken more time. They look good from far, but when it sits in front of you they look poorly made. Other than that, the steel seems sturdy with a nice rubber pad on the bottom. The outer lip of the coaster is good to hold some condensation that drips off the cup so it won't ruin wood furniture."
1,Not as heavy as they look!,"I purchased these thinking that for the price ($21.00 from Amazon when I purchased them) that they were a solid chunk of stainless steel which had been machined to have an area for the cup to sit. In reality, however, they are a very thin sheet of steel that has been stamped into the shape shown. They are very lightweight, and if you press on the bottom of the coaster, it is so thin that you can actually warp the metal. I'll be sending these back because they feel like something I can get at the 99-cent store."
3,Its already dated a bit,Its a brief summary of what we know and what in 1997 we were looking at. Nothing very deep but readable. Some of the issues have already been solved such as Fermat last theorem.
2,Skip this one,"I hold a doctorate in a highly technical field and even I had a tough time following the extremely scientific writing. This is not a good choice for the layperson. Much better is Kako's ""Visions"". Skip this one, grab my recommendation."
2,Skip and Thud,"I would skip this one. It is comprehensive, but far from scintillating. It is not a page turner (except to the extent that the reader is repeatedly compelled to turn to the end of the text to follow the numerous endnote calls, many of which I considered overly pedantic and unnecessary). I forced my way through it because I hate to start a book without finishing it; but it was a chore. In this category (future of science), I enjoyed M. Kaku's ""Visions"" and F. Dyson's ""Imagined Worlds"" much more."
2,Maddox missed his target audience by more than a few degrees,"Heaven help the reader who tries to decipher this book without a B.A., B.S., M.A., M.S., M.Ed., and Ph.D. Although intended for the general public, Maddox has completely missed the mark with his highly technical writings. The only chapters that I could fully comprehend were those in which I have completed college courses. The rest is a boggling mass that defty defies comprehension. Unless you're a professional, or a highly devoted amateur, the book will hold little value for you. Don't get me wrong: I love scientific journals and have always taken the label ""nerd"" as a compliment but this book was not worth while. The only people who will fully comprehend the book are those who do not need to be told What Remains to be Discovered."
3,Nice review of our know-how's status quo,"The most significant feature of this book is its author caution to indulge in speculative thinking. Thus, this text is a useful account of the state of our ignorance in the scientific realm. Something that is missing is a collection of views of developments to be expected, on the basis of what we now know; speculation is not bad, provided it's kept in check. There are a number of misleading typos and one or two instances of what seem to be conceptual errors (something difficult to believe in a man like John Maddox, with his long experience on scientific stuff.)"
4,Something for Everyone,"John Maddox has written a readable account of possible future discoveries and the directions science will take in this future. This book, What Remains to Be Discovered, is not fully comprehensive or authoritative but the author, instead, selects certain important topics and digests them into small enough sizes to be understandable to a wide variety of readers and large enough to cover the selected topic with appropriate breadth. It is sometimes a struggle for the non-science minded but the the author always manages to get across the basic idea and, more importantly, just why this idea will be so important in the future. I enjoyed this challenging book more than I had any right to do."
3,I agree with all of the other reviews.,"Oddly enough, I agree with all of the previously submitted reviews. There is a lot to like in this book, as well as many flaws. Maddox set himself an impossible goal of explaining where all of science stands at the end of the century, and damn near did it. However, as a reader who is not a professional scientist but is thoroughly familiar with scientific literature and concepts, I found quite a lot of the book boring. Maddox' basic thesis that Horgan is wrong, however, is spot on, and needs to be repeated as often as possible."
4,Great for the Bongo Beginner,"An great simple book for those people aspiring to become a ""bongocero"". It provides information on tuning, musical drum notation, basic bongo techniques and rhythms. It should keep you busy until you are ready to move onto the next intermediate book of the bongo series, ""The Bongo Book"" by Trevor Salloum."
4,Great for a real beginner,"It's a great book for real beginners, where you ca learn to read music and very easy exercises to star with. But, you will need another book to be able to play rithms. The other books starts where this one finishes."
4,Reasonably well-written book for a novice like me,"But I would have preferred a slightly different format.The mingling of multiple languages in each page, gave me the same disheartening feeling of reading a User Manual for some consumer electronics products. May be Mr. Salloum or Mel Bay would consider this in their next edition of the book and in other future publications.The music CD is quite useful."
1,Cobol and VB on .NET - tough to read,"I really tried hard to get somthing out of this book. The author just wont sit still long enough to get to the point (show me how this works)... darting from one thought to another without finishing the original thought (except to say 'This is beyond the scope...', then offer some random comments completely off the mark). The book is comprehensive (about 1000 pages and 7-8 pounds), but not clearly written. I am sure the author knows what he is talking about, he just does not know how to include the reader into the process (except to refer to a hundred different places for 'clarification'). Maybe next time (if he bothers), he will write a much shorter book on the subject, keep his flittering comments and comical bursts to himself and concentrate on giving the reader something of value for the time and money invested in trying to learn something from this book. A big disappointment."
1,Not Much Here,I didn't think Chadwell could write a book I wouldn't like but she succeeded with this one. I don't really care for 'romance' stories all that much but that would surely cover the type of book this is. I thought it might be one of her first efforts.So I forgave her.
2,Bride fire,"I was disappointed to find that tha author was not the Elizabeth Chadwick that I expectedHowever I did enjoy reading the book, tho the ending was abrupt, as there was no further mention ofThe lost daughter and other loose ends that left a dissatisfied reader."
4,Western Stories,"Sharon is determined to win Ridge and Layne is determine to win Creed. The short stories are fast moving tales that you can finish when you don't have a lot of time to sit and read. Their themes are the same but the plots put you into very different situations. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
5,All that could be asked for,"Apparently the first-ever release of this 1950s classic in RCA's Living Stereo CD (and now SACD) reissue series, this collaboration between Artur Rubenstein and Fritz Reiner has all of the fire AND sparkle demanded by the more angst-ridden of Brahms' two piano concerti. Here and there the recording shows its age, but the magnificence of the music-making here transcends any minor sonic limitations."
1,Disapointed,This is just a stereo recording. If you think that SACD is being offered you will be disapointed just like me.
2,Me gustaba mucho hasta que....,"A mí me gustaba mucho este libro. Lo consultaba a menudo y lo recomendaba a todos mis amigos, sintiendo gran orgullo por mi compatriota... hasta que caí en la cuenta de que un buen 80% (ochenta porciento) de lo allí detallado fue tomado directamente de la enseñanza de Alice Bailey (de la Escuela Arcana) SIN HACER LA MENOR MENCIÓN de este hecho. El nombre de Alice Bailey o referencia a ella no aparece por ninguna parte en este libro, ni mucho menos indicaciones de que se tomó ""prestado"" el material o de qué libro de Bailey.Esto me desilusionó mucho ya que R. Cedeño se auto-presenta como un gran sabio, cuando lo único que hizo fue copiarse de una que posiblemente sí lo fue.Y por otro lado, el que haya estado relacionado de alguna manera con Conny Méndez (y que le hagan el mercadeo como tal) no significa que sepa de lo que está hablando, ni que sus intenciones sean buenas o idóneas."
1,Check out the Internet reviews before buying anything from Lou,"There are bad reviews all over the internet from this guy for doing what he did when we bought a juniper from him. He promises one thing and sends another. He then promises to replace it, but the replacement is as bad as the original. Be careful. This guy isn't a merchant you want to do business with."
1,Don't learn philosophy from a novelist!,"Maybe someone in the Amazon community can disabuse me of this notion, but this book seems almost entirely worthless. If you want a very quick introduction to these philosophers, you would do better on Wikipedia (especially the German version). Gombrowicz is, I think, one of the principal novelists of the last century. His short stories are tremendous; ""Cosmos"" in the new translation is a masterpiece. I thought that even if I wasn't persuaded by his take on philosophy, I might learn something about him, or about his novels; and I also thought I'de be entertained, because he can be fabulously funny.But I can't get any insight into his novels from this; it's apparently intended to be whimsical, but for me, at least, there isn't much whimsy here. And I would not read it for information about these philosophers.But if someone out there can make the connection between his novels and this book, I'd be happy to hear about it."
1,WPC54A / WPA54A Combo under Win2k,"The units work for 5-30 mniutes then lock up, and <ctrl><alt><del> does not bring up the task manager. A cold boot is required.There is no updated driver since 4/18/02 and this appears to be a known issue - see:Newsgroup: comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.networkingfor details.I would not recommend these for operation under the OS Windows 2000 pending the release of a certified driver.-= Chris ß =-Update: Unit now somewhere in a US landfill or in India getting hacked...

1,DOA? DON'T BUY THESE EARPLUGS.,"I got these earplugs mostly because they come with a chord and a case. Otherwise I would have continued to use disposable ones. The earplugs do not actually come inside the case that they come with (at least mine didn't), and they came with the three rings on one earplug completely bent. There is no seal between my ear and the earplug and therefore they are and always were completely useless. I just thought it was more trouble to complain about them to Amazon or Adorama then they're actually worth.TL;DR: DON'T BUY THESE EARPLUGS. (unless you just want the case)"
3,"USB issues, alternative firmware.","If you're planning on using this device with alternative firmware, be aware that this model (wl-520gu) has known USB port issues. It's unclear if the problem is hardware or software. Depending on what you want to do, you may or may not encounter problems; for example, printing and usb disk access seem to work for most folks, but I could not get my USB 3G/EVDO aircard working for an internet connection. I tried various versions of openwrt, dd-wrt, and koppel(USB 3G enabled firmware based on ASUS source), with similar results. Info about the USB issue(s) can be found via your favorite search engine.If you're planning on using the router for printing, be sure to make sure your printer is supported on the Asus site. It does raw pass-through printing - there is no queue (not cups based). Giving this 3 stars because it seems pretty decent as a wi-fi router otherwise."
2,Suddenly not compatible,"Purchased this router a year ago, and although I had problems setting it up, we eventually got there and it has run fine since. But I recently bought a new computer - a Mac - and suddenly had all sorts of problems. After spending HOURS on the phone with different ASUS customer service people, I was told that this router is not compatible with a Brother printer (which it has been hooked up to and working with for the past year) and that is is not compatible with a Mac computer, and that Mac computers are not compatible with Brother printers.I'm purchasing another brand, and advise everyone to consider otherwise, too."
5,ASUS WL-520gu with tomato 1.28,"I use the ASUS WL-520gu, loaded with Tomato 1.28 (ND), for my business.Very stable device and the price is right. Free shipping by Amazon is a plus.Flashing Tomato is a bit of a problem because it cannot be done with the installed ASUS firmware.You must first downgrade an older version of the ASUS firmware, namely WL520gu_2.0.0.8_EN.tr. Get it from the ASUS web site.Next rename the tomato.ND.trx firmware to WL520gu_2.0.0.9_EN.trx to fool any sanity checks in the downloader software.Finally flash the re-named tomato firmware.I do this using my MacBook Pro (Mac OS X 10.7.2) and Safari.Please note that tomato 1.28 does NOT support the USB port in the router. I don't need it for my system.Tomato works great on the WL-529gu.---Bernie"
2,Slow,Seems to bo slower than the Belkin I used to have. Software is not up to date. Hard to configure security and stay connected to internet. Only advantage is the USB printer port. Would not recomend
