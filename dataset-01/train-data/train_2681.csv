2,UNBELEIVABLE,"Although I admit I could not put this book down I must say that this was because of the total banality of the writing. I lost count of the times I interrupted my wife's leisure time to assail her with extracts from this book. (The SAS Commandos booed) when the killer whale didn't attack the US Navy seal. (the SAS Commandos cheered)when it did attack him.I can only describe this as the literary equivalentof the tv version of Batman and Robin, but at least that was supposed to be over the top and silly.Will I read another book by this author? Idoubt it.."
1,I cant even give it 1 star.,This was the worse book I have ever read! A couple of US Marines taking on 50 SAS Soldiers? HO HO HO.. What more can I say?
1,One of the worst books I have ever read,"This book is unreadable for a number of reasons:-amateurish style. I cringed at least once per page at his awkward phrases and childish descriptions;-ludicrous action. One fight scene goes for roughly 100 pages, getting more and more unbelievable as time s-l-o-w-l-y ticks by;-cardboard characters. How many cliches can Reilly fit into one book?;-ridiculously unbelievable situations. One or two might be okay, but almost *everything* that happens will insult your intelligence.Overall, this thing makes me wonder if it ever saw an editor. Certainly not a competent one. I heard that Reilly paid to have his first book published himself. I can see why."
1,Please make the dreams go away,I really enjoyed reading about the destruction of a sub using a magnetic gun to shoot a grenade through an open missile hatch - UNDERWATER.I was so happy the scuba diving hero avoided the torpedos fired at him.I felt I was coasting on a new plane of consciousness.I guess I just felt proud of what I was spending my time on.
4,Matthew Reilly - Ice Station,"I found this book in a bag of paperbacks offered by an co-worker. I selected it because it looked like a book that offer escape and it did. I generally don't read fiction because it is realistic but just a good read. I recently downloaded two more Matthew Reilly books and paid for both of them. If you are looking for escapism with a sexy good looking leading man, this is a good place to go."
3,A little too fantastical for me...,"This author was recommended to me by a friend and fellow action/adventure reader. I wasn't really sure what to expect as I hadn't read anything about the author previously. Once into the book, I was hooked immediately. The action was swift and the characters were well written. It came to a point though where the events became too unbelievable. I'm a big fan of the James Rollins Sigma Series and this topped even those books for outlandish escapes and survivalism. In retrospect, I wish I would have known that going in because it would have made the book more enjoyable with proper expectations set. I have just started Area 7 and with the knowledge of how Ice Station was written, I'm sure to enjoy that one just a little more."
3,Action or plausability??,"I have rated this book as a middling 3, because it really depends on what type of book you are looking for.If you want action, death-defying scenarios, and a victory for the good guys, BUT most importantly are prepared to sacrifice some elements of reality and plausability in the process, then this book is for you.However, those looking for a 100% accurate and realistic account of military events will be disappointed. Whether or not you liked the book, (and I myself loved it), you cannot overlook some of the blatant 'research' errors contained within the book, nor can you accept the fact that Shane Schofield has not died by the end of the book, or even after the first few battles.It is a terrific book in terms of packing a punch, but the realism that is usually required for books of this genre is lacking, much like his other works. However, especially if you are a male teenager, there is still a lot of enjoyment to be had out of reading this book."
3,Anarctic intrigue,"Mayhem has occurred at the Wilkes Ice Station, a U.S. research facility located in the inhospitable icy wasteland of Antarctica. Eight scientists while diving beneath the ice shelf detected an apparent alien spacecraft in the deep recesses of an underwater cavern. While in communication topside with the station the team was attacked by an unknown entity and all were killed.An urgent SOS for help was broadcast and hopefully received by other research stations in the Antarctic. The message was received aboard the U.S.S. Shreveport docked in Sydney harbor. In communication with the Undersecretary of Defense, Lieutenant Shane Schofield, leader of a crack Marine Force Recon Unit was commissioned to investigate at Wilkes."
2,Just Couldn't Get Into It,"While the novel was most certainly action packed, I think it suffered under the weight of all the action. While it presents a great premise and plot, the numerous Indiana Jones type escapes just got to be too much. I recently purchased TEMPLE by the same author and hope that he spends a little more attention to character development."
5,yeeeeeeee-haaaaaaa!,"Dear Reviewers Who Gave This One Star. Get a life, would you? It's not Shakespeare, and it's not meant to be. What it is, is an incredibly fast-paced action piece where characterisation is secondary to pure adrenaline pumping action! And it's a great achievement - anyone who can make their writing so visual, so frenetic, so manic must be some kind of genius! And if he's stretched plausibility a little, well, who the hell cares? Films forget about reality all the time - who says books can't do it too!Personally I think you're jealous because he's 24 and published.To everyone else, take a deep breath, suspend your sense of disbelief, and hang on tight. You're in for quite a ride."
1,"All Action, no sense.","Reilly has a great sense of action and what will work on the big screen - Unfortunately, this does not translate into a working knowledge of how things work on the page. Although this book has more action crammed into it than most adventure series, Reilly's one dimensional characterisation, confused prose and liberal views on the use of little things like nouns and verbs, render it a poor homage to Grisham and Spielberg."
1,Not worth it -- no fun,"I have to agree with the negative reviews. *Everything* has been sacrificed in an attempt to make a fast-paced action book: there's no plot, character or realism. The book is full of contrivances that serve to keep the action becoming derailed but they ring very hollow. Lots of cliches; lots of impossible escapes. In a few scenes, you skip ahead because what you are reading is just so embarrassingly awful. Reilly can't write and is trying to turn an overambitious screenplay into a book and, ultimately, a movie. Just not fun. Skip this and his others; try Clancy or Coontz or Patrick Robinson instead."
3,Exciting,"This book is ridiculously implausible. The protagonist is a US Marine but he might as well be Superman. It's gratuitously violent and an insult to my intelligence. Nontheless, it's exciting as hell and I can't stop reading it."
2,too much,"Like rich chocolate, this book is good but it's just too hard to swallow. so much action that suspension of disbelief becomes impossible because one forgets what 'real' is. Just one fight after another, lots of italics and exclamation points. This is fun stuff but its just too much action. i can't believe i just said that but it's true."
2,"So little story, so much action!","First the reader gets interested in this ""alien spaceship""-topic, then he has to go through some 100 + pages of violence. Like this it gets on. It reminds me of the ""straight to video"" flics where they could not afford Steven Seagull. Much too much mindless and very farfetched action without any plotpoint (flying an aircraft through a tunnel in an iceberg that topples over... please! )"
5,This is why I love to read!,This was by far one of the most exciting and entertaining novels I've ever read! This was truly a non-stop action thriller that I just couldn't put down. The visuals that appeared in my brain were better than the last ten movies I've seen! This guy combined a phenomenal military thriller with a gruesome horror story that left me begging for more. (Let's just say that the next time you think killer whales you won't be picturing Shamu doing back flips at Sea World.) This book was great!
1,Utter trash,"This book is at approximately the maturity level of a 13 year old. No characterization whatsoever, a story line that has no credibility at all, dialogue that makes a Superman comic book look like literature by comparison, and complete lack of internal logic. Unbelievably poor, puerile, and chauvinistic; not even acceptable as light airplane reading. I rank this book as the worst I've read in several years, even making very large concessions to the fact that it is meant to be escapist entertainment. Forget it."
2,Not Impressed,"I've always heard ""If you're going to write a novel, stick to what you know"" The author doesn't know anything about the U.S.M.C. One, women are not allowed in Recon, no sexism, they just don't have the upper body strength to do the job, Two, Marines don't have ""medics"" they use Navy Hospital Corpsmen as their combat medical corpsmen, I know this as a fact, I was one. Three, they don't let Marine Captains drive Navy amphibious ships. After that one I gave up on this novel. The author needs to get his facts straight or maybe write about the Aussie S.A.S."
1,Fiction with a capital F,"Ice Station was an absolutely thrilling read for about the first three chapters. Thereafter the military inaccuracies began to irritate me, and made me question any other 'facts' that Matt Reilly came up with. Geological, biological, political ideas and scenarios all lost their credibility after a while. Clancy, Ludlum, and Le Carre all have found the knack writing their novels on the bleeding edge of reality and credibility; unfortunately Reilly ends up so far removed from that edge that I ended up laughing through the final chapters, and giggling to myself as the hero (who was quite obviously based on 'Batman') escaped certain death for every other page. Even Ian Flemming or Dale Brown aren't that cheesy. However, with a little more accurate research and a more believable hero, Reilly has got a cracking style of writing and despite myself I shall probably get his next novel: just for a laugh."
5,Greatest & most vivid NOVER ever: SMART too.,"Damn all the bad review of this book. As an X Files fan the idea of an alien spaceship is enough to get me to read it. This novel is detailed, fast paced and vivid WITH substance. I got this book for the Australian read a book for AU$5 promotion and the paperback quality it was printed on was superb and the best printing paper I have ever seen in my life. What I really loved about it was how the words on paper created a vivid, descriptive and clear picture in my mind of what was happening in the book. For once reading a novel is better than watching a James Bond or Terminator 3 movie. Read this book. You will end up caring for the characters. It's the BEST!"
4,Action!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Good fun, great action, be prepared to suspend disbelief so far that it might snap. Bruce Willis will play 'Scarecrow'. Only two things really bugged me. Matthew Reilly's annoying overuse of exclamation marks! Made the action sequences feel as though an eight year old was recounting them. ""Guess what...and then he did this!!!"" Also the proliferation of italics was equally annoying. I'm sure in Matthew's new book 'Temple' he will write the same ballistic cinematic action stuff but with a more mature approach. All in all, a top holiday type read. Good on ya, Aussie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Pittifully,Congratulations Matthew reilly you just made the listI hope he goes straight hell for this crime aganist Humanity
1,HOW DOES THIS STUFF GET PUBLISHED?,"HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ANYONE WOULD SPEND MONEY TO PRINT OR BUY THIS KIND OF JUNK. THE COVER SAYS ""INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER"" ! I AGREE WITH ANOTHER REVIEWER, IN THE ROUND FILE NOW."
1,One of the worst books I've read.,"It is pretty bad, it's for people who are willing to suspend their intelligence for the time it takes to read this book. It's a comic book in text form.But it's par for the course for a Matt Reilly book. It has implausible action, inane dialog and unrealistic 2D characters. You either love it or hate it."
1,This book is AWFUL!!!,"I was interested for the first hundred pages or so, then next hundred pages or so were just a rewrite of the first with a new set of enemies. I have to confess to you that I did not finish this book, but how could I this book is terrible. Who has time to read awful book when there are so many good book out there. My advices don't ever read this book is a total waste of time."
3,"Better than some of his other books, but...","Of the 2.5 books of his that I read, this one was tolerable enough for me to at least finish it. Of course, like his other stories, you'll need to suspend belief for much of it and ignore the glaring inaccurate elements, but if you can move past that, then you may find it to be an OK read. If you have nothing else to read. And you find this book after someone left it behind."
4,Great beach read,"I read this book while lying on the beach ... in Australia! It was a perfect escapist experience, easy to read, and honestly I could not put it down. Finished in a day and a half. Sometimes I'm in the mood for serious literature and sometimes I don't. This book is like watching one of those over-the-top, all-out action movies: suspend your disbelief; sit back; relax; go with it. It's a wild ride."
4,Pretty Good Thriller - Very Rollinsesque,"I had been disappointed in Seven Deadly Wonders. However, I decided to try Ice Station because I've always liked Antarctic Thrillers. And you know what, this wasn't half bad. The action was intense, and more importantly, correct in it's realism. Many thriller authors have little or no understanding of the US Military. However, Matt Reilly does have the knowledge and understanding of not only the US military, but of some of the European militaries, as well.One thing that I liked in this novel that wasn't well done in Seven Deadly Wonders was the character development. In Wonders, Reilly is constantly going off on tangents when attempting to detail the characters. In Ice Station, it's done much more smoothly and it reads much better.Probably the only thing I didn't like about the book was the US Military conspiracy theory, but hey, that's what helped make the story."
2,"Far fetched, too uch","It's interesting but too far fetched, yes I know it's fiction but come on.The pace is good, it does go on a bit in some parts and gets a little slow."
5,a non putdownable book!!,"Im not a novel reader, but when was advised to read ice station, i couldnt put it down. I was extremely impressed with the story, the maps at the front of the novel and the military information, although the killer whales attacking humans made it seem less real but everything else was fantastic.Matt Reilly made the marines into lovable characters such as Scarecrow and Mother and wasnt afraid to kill some off or badly injure them in some way.Once you read ice station you'll be hooked and i advise to read his other books like area 7"
5,I loved this book,I really liked this book and I don't usually read alot of books but this is was an exception to my rule. I couldn't put it down. It's full of action from the start to the end.I recomend this book to anyone. Matthew Reilly has done a great job writing this and I can't wait to read what he writes next.
1,Puerile improbabilities,"My biggest problem with this book is that I actually finished it.It is farrago of silly hair-breadth escapes, super-human feats of derring-do, hackneyed characters and, most damning, execrable research (SCUBA diving at 3000 feet?, lactic acid in the trachea?, on and on). Incredulity mushrooms after the first 10 pages rendering the remainder of the opus laughable. The only redeeming feature of the book is the depiction of the French as enemies (a notion anyone who has ever been to Paris will readily accept). This book has all the worst qualities of an already quality-challenged genre."
5,Action Packed Thrill Ride,"So its a little unbelievable but half of the action books/movies made are. If you can get over that, this book has you wanting to skip the next page to find out what happens. I couldnt put the book down. When I finished it, I wanted more. From cover to cover, this was an excellent action book."
2,"Might be a good movie, but as a book it sucked.","It started off good and exciting, but then it got so ridiculous that well... it was ridiculous.I know it's fictional, and i know authors often have a free license for things that are impossible, but some of the feats that were done, and things that were done with the maghook, was just absurd."
5,Crank on steroids....,"Check your belief at the door, strap yourself in and enjoy a non-stop thrill ride. Just remember to take a breath every once in a while. Fun, fun, fun. Loved every minute of it"
4,page-turner adventure,"Reilly's not a sophisticated writer(his books are essentially novelized screenplays), but he has definitely mastered the action scene. If you like adventure and don't require too much character development or a sophisticated plot, you'll enjoy this book."
3,Mutant Seals and Spaceships,"Reilly wrote this book to be made into a screenplay, nothing more. You can see his influence from action stars like Arnold, Bruce, Jon Claude and Jackie.The book is crisply written, it's characters have excellent backstories and the reader can't put the book down because the story never pauses.The only complaint I had, and it's a little one, is Reilly's obsessive use of italics. If you can't get the important point across without having to dress up the font, then do it in another way! It became a joke after a while to see how many times the text was italicized to press home the importance of the action.Reilly's good, but he needs to move beyond the 2 hour action movie format."
4,A farfetched entertaining read.,"Dirk Pitt, Indiana Jones, James Bond and Rambo all rolled into one super human marine. The story gets going from page one and does not let up for an instant. Even though it was one of the most preposterous stories I have read in a long time it was tough to put down, could not wait (or guess) the next incredible turn the story would take. Does not take any thought to get through, it was just plain fun. Maybe Scarecrow will turn up in a sequel with his old friend Trent and destroy half the world by themselves!"
1,"Sorry, way too predictable and shallow","This is the kind of book that gives action books a bad name. The worst thing -- for an action novel -- is that it is predictable. It reads like watching a gamer playing an action game at novice level. If you turn a corner of course there will be a bad guy there. If a new item appears - a weapon, a piece of machinery, an animal, of course it will be used in the next three pages. The plot is just this action, then that action, with no lead-in between them.The characters are just shallow action figures, no depth, no personality.Lastly, it is not believable -- all coincidences and ""deus ex machina"" to put the right things and the right info within reach at the right time -- but that would be tolerable, even fun, if the book was better written."
3,a bit ruff.,"The clevis is a bit on the ruff side, this could cut into the strap!A rat tail file will fix this."
3,Defective Closed Captions,"The hearing impaired reading that the set is advertized as ""Closed Captioned"" need to be warned that the captions are defective and mostly unreadable. Every so often they read fine, than gibberish. Too bad, the set otherwisd looks fine."
5,WHAT A LITTLE FIRECRACKER AS MADGE SAYS .,I CAN WATCH ALMOST ANYTHING DAME JUDI DENCH PERFORMS IN SUCH CLASS AND IT IS LIKE SHE IS THE PERSON THAT SHE BECOMES ON THE SCREEN FOR THE TIME SHE PLAYS ANY PART. YOU CAN BARELY TELL BETWEEN ACTOR AND PERSON. THOUGH YOU KNOW IT IS ONLY A PLAY OR MOVIE IT IS HARD TO TELL SHE DOES IT SO WELL. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THE MUSIC FROM THE MOVIE CAN YOU HEAR ME THINKING AND IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE TO GET THE MUSIC WHAT A LOVELY SONG. A WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF DENCH.B[...]
1,Too negative for my taste,"Although her tremendous talent shines through these early movies, I found the subject matter pretty depressing."
2,very disappointing,"""The Judy Dench Collection"" consists of captures from TV broadcasts, most of which are Black and White, even those from the mid 60's. Such a wonderful actress, but to be so poorly presented is shameful. A few of the movies are very clever, but the expected ""DVD Quality"" is just not there--just more TV shows."
3,Allot of ingredients or steps,"While the smoothies may be yummy, they require ALLOT of ingredients. Oranges, apples, strawberries AND then ginger or tofu or youghurt. If that doesn't bother you then the prep can be a bummer: pear nectar (make that first), then oranges with silken tofu AND soy milk & then blackberries!Don't know about you but I really don't have that kind of space or pantry. Some of these ingredients are expensive thus cutting down on homemade cheapness vs the store expense when you factor clean up in! Whew this not an easy book to tackle. If after all that I haven't dissuaded you then you'll truly enjoy it. It's got a lovely hand and beautifully coloured. A joy to the senses but it would have been IF more substitutions had been given but then the colour coordination would have been off."
3,"Recipes good, but paying too much for design of book","I really can't complain about the content of this book, I find most of the smoothies to be yummy and refreshing. However, I wanted one smoothie book to use with my blender and this isn't the only book I ended up getting. Plus, I've had this book for only about three months and I'm already getting tired of thumbing through it and seeing the same stuff. I really wish I had purchased a book that focused more on the quantity of recipes and less on the pictures of the recipes it did contain within (as this book does). I ended up purchasing Smoothies, Shakes & Frappes ISBN 1579121721 for about half the price and, with no disrespect to these authors, found this to be a better choice if it really is quantity of smoothie and shake recipes you are looking for."
4,Fun - But Healthy?,"Sixteen of the recipes require sorbet, sherbet, or frozen yogurt. Two more call for Gatorade, and three more after that are cocktails. These smoothies may be healthy TREATS, but they are not healthy enough to replace meals.As an aside, one needn't make pear nectar; no recipe is provided in the book. Most groceries stock it."
2,Not Such A Smooth Move,"Since I had been so happy with the Corpening sisters' first smoothie book, I was eager to give this second one a try, too. Unfortunately, I find these *specialty* smoothies quite off-putting. *All* of the smoothies are made with healthful ingredients, and to imply that some are particularly beneficial for your immune system, heart, energy level, decreasing stress, etc., is just plain misleading! Then there are separate smoothies for men, women, and children, including one calling for breast milk or formula! As a single mom, I want to make just one smoothie that is suitable for both myself and my son! This is just plain silly! I'm sure that the majority of these recipes could be altered so that you could/would serve them to everybody in your family at the same time, (my son does not want to share a smoothie called ""pms potion"" with me!) but why bother when the recipes in the first book are already completely drinker friendly."
3,Ingredient problems,All of the recipes looked good but some of them required items that we don't normally keep in the house.
3,Not my favorite smoothie recipe book,I didn't find this book as interesting as some of the other books that are available to read. That being said they still have some good recipes.
2,Where's the Beef?,"Just a few good recipes, if you like bananas. Too much eye candy and too few recipes. I'd pass on this one."
2,Pretty Pictures; Poor Recipe Content,"This book has a bunch of pretty pictures. But, that is not why I bought it. I expected to get first rate smoothie recipes. Instead, I got pictures of pretty glasses and colorful pictures of ""smoothie"" drinks. I guess you ""can't"" judge a book by its cover. Great for art; poor recipes."
1,Blenders down!,"This book has some great photos-but that's about it. I was thinking I would learn some basics for preparing smoothies-but I did not. The ingredients needed for most of the recipes would either be too expensive (unless in season) or too obscure to find easily-or both. I priced some of the recipes and it would be cheaper to get one from a shop then to make them myself. There was not a 'base' recipe so to speak..very different ingredients were listed for each recipe...All in all, I was terribly disappointed and some of the authors' comments raised more then 1 eyebrow when I ran them past experts. I'd say to pass on this book."
3,Slices thick; not made for 7 or 11 cup,"It's hard for me to give an accurate number of stars for this product because I didn't actually use it! I received this disc as a gift, but it was not the right size. I have an 11-cup Cuisinart food processor (of the DLC-8 series) and this disc is definitely made for the wider, 14-cup processors.But by the looks of it, the blade would definitely slice food into respectably thick pieces. The disc was solid, quality manufactured, with a very sharp blade.Also, if you're looking for an 8mm blade for an 11-cup processor, I don't think Cuisinart makes one. I've found them up to 6mm thick, but not 8mm."
4,Required Listening for Garage Bands,"I bought this CD because a buddy of mine kept raving about it...So I get and Crank it up and it is like no other band... The songs do not go away.. Hard to describe, easy to listen to and sing along.. I think that all the tunes have 4-5 chords max and the basic harmonies are refreshing! I must admit that I have played this over 50 times and it still sounds fresh. I guess its like a slick over produced version of the Kinks with a little Plimsoul or Smithereen vibe for good measure. My band has learned 3 tunes and we are trying to write more like these guys,, Simple, direct with killer hooks and simple harmonies.. You can't go wrong.. The Drysdales Didn't!"
5,Hook Filled CD From Chicago Area Quartet,"This is a great little album, chock full of infectious melodys and rememberable hooks. Features 11 original songs, and a cover of Del Shannon's ""Go To Pieces"".Expertly recorded and performed, this CD is also a great representation as to what the band sounds like live.Shades of the Kinks, the Beatles, and Badfinger, ""The Drysdales"" is a joy from start to finish.Scott McCarl from the Raspberries guests on a few tunes, and co-wrote and sings on one of them!It's money well spent. In the words of Webb Wilder....""Pick up on it!"""
5,A performance even the composers would love.,"Terrific recording of a talented harpsichordist playing works of several different 17th century composers. Performed with delicacy, expression, and musical virtuosity. Very inspirational for this music student."
2,Common Knowledge,No depth and no plan for how to cover the bases of network admin. Basically a pseudo-random list of opensource programs with really going into any details of application and configuration. Read any Linux magazine to get more detail.
4,A very good introduction,"This may not be all of Huddie William Ledbetter's essential recordings, but Indigo's budget-priced ""Good Mornin' Blues"" actually includes almost all of Leadbelly's best blues tunes, and several excellent folk songs as well...although ""Cotton Fields"" is unfortunately missing.""C.C. Rider"", ""Match Box Blues"", ""Packin' Trunk Blues"" and ""Rock Island Line"" are here, though, as is the original ""Midnight Special"", ""Gallis Pole"" (the basis for Led Zeppelin's ""Gallows Pole""), ""Goodnight Irene"", and ""Death Letter Blues"" (which has nothing in common with Son House's ""Death Letter"" other than the title).This is one of the very best single-disc Leadbelly compilations, and a great place to start.4 1/2 stars - highly recommended."
3,Staining,"This cake is fine in terms of taste and texture, but it is far too messy.The dye is so strong that a single drop of the batter will stain your clothing and be incredibly difficult to wash out. Not only that, but even after the cake is cooked, the red dye is still active and even the solid crumbs can stain your clothing. If I serve this cake on a plate then put the dirty dish in the sink and then rinse the dirty dish, the sink area will turn pink and I end up having to wash the sink after I wash the dishes!"
3,There's better collections.,"I don't know who makes the picks for these ""Millennium"" cd's, but this selection could be better, and longer. Where is ""Simply Irresistable"", ""Get it On (bang a gong)"", ""Johnny and Mary"", ""Mercy Mercy Me/I want You"", ""Some Like it Hot"", ""I'll Be Your Baby Tonight"", and ""Know By Now"", among others? I'm no fanatic, these are basic ""hits"". Though what's on here is good, I would go for ""Addictions Volume 1"", or the two disc ""Best of Both Worlds 1974-2001"", or the excellent, but out of print ""Very Best of Robert Palmer"". That's ""Simply Irresistable"". R.I.P."

5,Great for frustrated parents,I've been having a frustrating time with my son for the past 3 years and wished that I found this book much earlier than I did. This book presents alternative ways of approaching my troubled teen. I have applied some of the techniques; I'm seeing some positive changes only after about 2 to 3 weeks. I really recommend this book and the ideas in it.
2,not the best book,"hi, this book was not the best book, the recipes were not very good and way to simple. i live in the rio grande valley, 12 miles from mexico. and these are not even close to the recipes down here. i would not recommend this book."
2,Very few real world examples,"This is actually a good book, however, it approaches the subject with an extremely hypothetical view. Lack of real world examples has made reading this book a real bore.The book on the other hand offers in-depth information regarding the ""behind the scenes"" work of .NET remoting.Final verdict: Good value for money, but do not expect any code to work."
2,"Convulted, Mistakes, and Too Light","This is one of the worst .NET books in my collection on any subject.Here's why:1. Riddled with mistakes. Lots of the code does not work, and lots of the XML contains blatant syntactical errors. That certainly lowers my trust of a book, making me question the accuracy of the content.2. No decent examples. Although it's nice to get the ""internals"" of how .NET works, I'd preferred that the author spent more time on developing reasonable examples.3. Hard to follow. There's far too much jumping from one topic to another (and back to the fact that there are few examples). Many topics have only marginal coverage, like using Windows Services with .NET Remoting.Overall, a disappointment. I have found the .NET documentation and online resources to be better than this book. I'd recommend you stay away from this book. I'm confused by the other reviews for this book, as the readers must be interested in something that I am not."
2,A very misleading book,"I agree with the reviewer who was confused about all the positive reviews. It's a very linear book that oversimplifies a very tricky subject. As you're reading along the examples seems to make everything clear. Then you realize that the knowledge gained is superficial. Tcp channels are mostly non-existant and working with configuration files, is not only lacking, the first example simply has wrong, or just confusing, information. Soapsuds is not well covered either and requires outside reading. In fact this is true in many areas.It's a strange hybrid book. The beginning chapters are rudimentary, even sketchy, and the second half is overly detailed in a way that I found hard to learn from. There should be more real world examples. There are some things I've learned and some of the advanced examples are useful but it's not a book I'd heartily recommend. Finally, for me, this books organization distracts from it's use as a .net remoting reference."
5,A truly great resource on remoting,"What I love about this book is the fact that it shows not only working examples but also examples that seem intuitive and correct but are indeed wrong. In other words, the author tells how _not_ to program and why, which is very important.When building a distributed application, normal programming rules don't apply. Networks get disconnected, servers or clients ""die"", object serialization is used differently, and remote event handling is tricky. This books covers all of that, and much more."
2,cleaner,This cleaner may or may not be effective. It seems to work but I don't know if results would be the same with another cleaning agent.
3,Good Cleaner,This product did a good job. Used it in conjunction with the steam cleaning machine and my jewelry came out very sparkling.
3,The bottles were leaking,"Whoever, probably someone in shipping, took the leaking bottle and placed it in a plastic ziplock(tm) bag.....Thank you. You saved the shipment from becoming a soggy mess. Otherwise, the item works as advertised. Use it to clean the gas jets on my stove. Havn't tried it on my mother's 100 year old diamond ring yet."
4,works great but u only need a small amount,"I got this to use with my ultrasonic cleaner and the suggested amount to use was way too much because my engagement ring needed to be washed several times to remove the soapy residue that was left behind. I find that even a small drop of it does wonders. Do yourself a favor and don't use too much. Remember, less is more"
5,Mom loves it,Mom loves it and said she would order more when she usses it all up. must be a good product.
1,Probably a waste of money,After we got the cleaner we realized that a drop of normal dishwashing soap did just fine. Haven't used any yet.
1,Not needed,"After purchasing along with the ultrasonic cleanerand paying almost the same amount for the shippingas the solution, I was advised bythe manufacturer that this itemwas no needed to use with the cleaner."
5,great cleaner,Have used this great cleaning agent in my sonic cleaner and it cleans like a charm. It arrived well packaged and on time.
3,Purchased this with the ultrasonic jewelry cleaner,"This product will last a long time, as it only takes a few drops to the water in the ultrasonic jewelry cleaner. I see that regular dish detergent would probably work too. But, having this concentrate assures me I am doing the best job I can."
3,Good product,"Only used this a couple of times and believe its a good product, just not great. Yes, it helps get the items you want clean, however there always seems to be a film or residue left afterwards, which usually can dissapear after rinising the product off in plain water. The other note is that they say about using the cap as a measuring tool to use the product. It would be nice if they had a better cap that actually could measure the liquid instead of trying to fill a thumbil up a half dozen times for the larger tanks."
5,Jewelry cleaner exceed expectations,This product cleaned the jewelry perfectly and made to diamonds shine. I would recommend the product to anyone that uses an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner.
3,I think it does the job,"I am not sure if this does what it says it does....I mean...I have an ultra sonic tank and I use this stuff but I can't always get it to smell right...my watch smells like sweat when I don't wash it...stainless band...this stuff makes it smell alright for a day...but so does water, but I leave everything in there from when I go to sleep, then when I wake up, I put it on after it dries...but I don't know, I don't have anything to put this up against...but if I run out...I might buy it again..like i said...a day...and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg :)"
5,Love it!,"I purchased this along with the ""ultra sonic jewelry cleaner""... the two work beautifully together! I cannot remember the last time my jewelry was this sparkly! So pleased with the purchase!"
2,Not worth the money,"Dish soap worked just as good, if not better. Don't waste money on this, not worth it. A few drops of dish soap."
1,Product not recomended,This product didn't work. Besides I follow the use procedures. I waste my money out. I do not recomend this product.
4,Jewery cleaner,I use this in the utrsonic unit. I guess it works better than a couple of drops of dish soap. Not sure if I can tell the difference.
4,Jewelry cleaner,Like other people said use less then what's recommended...works GREAT with diamonds and good on other stones. I use it for my diamond and sapphire wedding ring
4,Works as advertised,"I bought this to go with an ultrasonic cleaner I was purchasing. I tried cleaning a ring with and without this, and I can say the ring seemed a lot cleaner after I used this item in the machine (of course, it could have also been because it was the second time through the machine!). The product doesnt have any kind of odor, and is clear and doesnt stain or tint jewelry items. I also used it in the machine while I was cleaning my eyeglasses, after rinsing well I have had no bad effects. The product works as advertised. You can, of course, always just use dish soap in an ultrasonic machine, and that is probably what I will do for my non-jewelry products such as my eyeglasses and CD's or DVD's. I will continue to use this cleaner for my jewelry for now though."
4,Very Good Stuff!,"Very efficient, you don't have to burn up a lot of time (or elbow grease) on shining things so they look great. Also doesn't wear through any plated items. Highly recommended!"
5,As ordered,Product is as ordered and shipped and arrived promptly. Bought it for my wifes new jewelry cleaner. Can't wait for her to put it to use.
4,Works well,"Works well, recommend use a heavier than instructed mix for very tarnished and dirty items. Excellent for fine jewlery, coins and glasses."
2,Triplett Wiremaster XR-5,"We purchased two of these triplett testers. We regularly repair and rewire existing networks in buildings. These triplett testers work great unless any power is supplied to them on the remote side. If a cat5 cable is plugged into a switch on the other side because it may be labeled wrong, plan on replacing the triplett. This happened to both devices within 2 days. This is the only time I have ever seen testers with this issue. We went to home depot and bought cheaper testers that seem to have no issue with this. I would only recommend this item if you are not working on an existing network."
4,Not bad for the money,"Not a bad product. Performs as advertised. I would recommend one improvement; a 6 pin to 4 pin Firewire test. As shipped, it only test 6 pin to 6 pin."
4,I've been waiting for a release like this!,"After two very disappointing and weak albums in form of ""Sound of lies"" 1997 and ""Smile"" 2000, it seemed that departure of Mark Olson left Jayhawks in the musical land of mediocrity. But the band have returned with their strongest album since ""Hollywood town hall"" from 1992.""Rainy day music"" is certainly an album similar to the early musical direction with a fair amount of country. This is alternative country/americana of highest quality, equally great as Whiskeytown's finest moments. As ""Stumbling through the dark"" begins, it's clear that Jayhawks finally have gotten back to their roots. This release is full of catchy and melodic tunes with beautiful vocal harmonies and arrangements. Just listen to ""Tailspin"", ""Save it for a rainy day"", ""Angelyne"" and ""Will I see you in heaven"" among others, and you'll discover that Jayhawks might have released the album of the year.I just hope this album get the recognition it deserves!"
5,amazing CD,"I had heard of the Jayhawks during my years of working at a book/music store but never really heard any of their stuff. Then a couple weeks ago they were interviewed on NPR's Weekend Edition and played some songs off ""Rainy Day Music"" and suddenly I became obsessed with hearing the full album.Every song on this CD is absolutely amazing. Their simple yet elegant harmonies, combined with the lyrics, makes for an album that trancends musical genres while paying homage to the great songwriters/musicians of the late sixties and early seventies."
4,Sad Songs?,"There's no doubt about it, these selections lack the energy of previous albums, but get the hint...the title of the CD is ""Rainy Day Music"". This album is full of sad, melancholy music, but very thoughtful. Reminds me of those days that everything was seemingly boring and mundane, but you eventually recognize the beauty and importance of every minute. The blend of their voices is definitely retro 70s, easy, simple acoustic guitar and rhythm. Sit back and remenisce..."
5,wow,"I bought this cd about a year ago, and I must have listened to it distractedly once, and then it got misplaced somewhere. I have recently rediscovered it and it hasn't moved out of the cd player since. I don't think I would be lying if I said this was the most heart-breakingly beautiful album I have ever heard. Angelyne moves me to tears everytime I hear it. The vocals and guitarwork throughout the whole album are magnificent. This is an album I don't think I will tire of anytime soon."
3,"""RainyDayMusic""Doesn'tSeemAsInspiredAsPreviousAlbums2Me","I've listened to every other album but ""Blue Earth"" by The Jayhawks--alot. The three songs I really like off this album are ""Tailspin,"" ""Angelyne,"" and ""Will I See You In Heaven.""If you get this album w/ the ""limited edition, bonus"" EP, the live, acoustic version of ""Waiting For The Sun"" is pretty novel.If I could only take one Jayhawks CD with me to a deserted island, ""Rainy Day Music"" would not be that CD."
3,Its no Smile,"or Sound of Lies for that matter. While I may not be a Jayhawks purist (I became a true fan after Smile), I prefer the Jayhawks' CDs, Smile and Sound of Lies over the country rock sound of Rainy Day Music. The tracks on Smile alternate between a polished pop sound and hard driving rock-n-roll. After seeing the Jayhawks live for the first time a couple of years ago, I concurred with the rumor that the Jayhawks were the best bar band in America. While Rainy Day Music is great for a rainy day, the CD lacks any jams like the classic ""Baby, Baby, Baby"""
3,The Return of Poco.,"Yes, this is a very good album, and the Jayhawks are a very enjoyable band. No, they are not the Byrds, or Buffalo Springfield, or the Flying Burrito Brothers, or CSN, or some of the other seminal bands mentioned in other reviews. Rather, they're the modern day Poco -- lacking the depth or vision of the aforementioned pioneers, but turning out beautifully crafted, wonderfully hummable little gems of folk-pop featuring strong vocals, tight harmonies, catchy melodies, top-notch musicianship, and disposable lyrics. Like Poco, too, each of their albums includes some lackluster material. (Yes, even ""Town Hall"" and ""Green Grass."") And I write this as a fan of the Jayhawks and Poco. Highly enjoyable music, but not essential or life-changing. For that, you need to turn to Messrs. McGuinn, Crosby, Hillman, Clark, Parsons, and Young."
4,quality continues...,"The post Olson Jayhawks continue in their fine musical wxploration by creating a fine folk/pop record. Lyrically, it is not as indepth as Sound of Lies, but better than the substandard Smile. Sonically, the music is mellow with hooks that come out and grab you at just the right and sometimes unexpected time. TRy to find the limited edition version with the EP disc of six additional songs/outtakes/live versions. Not just for the collector only, but also for the casual fan. And, even though the Olson led Jayhawks made great cd's, I think it is the other way around, the Jayhawks have continued on and Olson has gotten stuck in a rut (a good rut, but a rut nonetheless!) Get the disc."
4,Rainy Day Music on a Sunny Day,"An enormous indicator of an album's ability to move the listener is how the first run through goes. Rainy Day Music immediately gave one as comfortable an experience as an old pair of jeans. Make no mistake the is a band truly at the top of their game continuing under the radar of mainstream success, to their benefit once again, and exploring all the sounds and instruments of their influences. Sure there is the obvious Byrds-like jingle jangle, but it is also channeled through a Dylanesque vocal style only with lovely melody. Gary Louris continues to emerge as a songwrtiter who actually studies his craft, as the images of his words rivet the listener the same way an actor lights up at the reading of a good script. This should give fans just what we need in the climate of today, but don't rely on commerical radio the get your fix, get this one yourself."
4,Recalls Tomorrow the Green Grass and Blue Earth,"The new disc is sort of a return to form for the Jayhawks. The Wall of Sound production of ""Smile"" is gone, as is the Brit-pop of ""Sound of Lies."" Instead, ""Rainy Day Music"" has the acoustic flavor of ""Tomorrow the Green Grass,"" with even some touches of the country sound all over ""Blue Earth."" Gary's voice sounds a little older and a little more aching -- you get more of the plaintive high register singing that appears on the title track on ""Sound of Lies."" He really sounds great, nice and clear on this album -- emerging from behind the vocal effects all over ""Smile."" And the songs are just as tuneful and catchy as ever. The one thing I miss on this album is the prominent piano that you had with Karen Grotberg and Jen Gunderman. But a really strong effort overall."
2,Sentimental crap,"This album is embarassingly maudlin and cheesy; lyrically way out of step with the charms of previous Jayhawks records. Save for the opening two tracks, Rainy Day Music is a Hallmark card of a record, a real cringe-fest. Skip it."
1,boring music. zzz...,bought this for my wife. she hates it and so do i. lame. love some of their previous albums. but this one does not make it for me.
1,A recipe for Disaster! How not to do or learn Flooring!,"Very low budget, poorly organized and poorly presented. This DVD is guaranteed to get the novice or weekend Do-it-yourselfer in big trouble! The information it presents is HIGHLY incomplete. It does not present the material in a logical step-by-step manner and essentially what you get is a sound bite. It leaves out too many critical steps to be of any use! And forget about the helpful hints, tips, short cuts and friendly advice. Not here! I recommend the Hometime video series by Dean Johnson or just picking up a Flooring video at any of the large home centers, for a fraction of the price! This DVD should either be thouroughly updated or removed from the market!"
5,This tea tastes great!,"This tea tastes absolutely fantastic. It's a great afternoon tea with a very unique flavor. Only downside is the price, but I'd be willing to buy again, though not as often as I'd like."
2,Irrelevant rehash,"I can't really see a point to this book. It brings nothing new to the Arbuckle story, and the writing is weak. There's nothing here that wasn't covered in more detail -- and better -- in David Yallop's ""The Day the Laughter Stopped."""
3,"interesting and important story, doesn't come across that well","the subject matter is interesting, the movie is full of talented actors, shot in black and white with constant smoking throughout by all in an attempt to create the feel of the time. however, it fails to grip those watching so somehow you don't really care."
5,Inexpensive but it's real wood and works just fine.,"Not much else to say. It's inexpensive and has real wood. Typical made in China stuff but for under five bucks, why not? I can reach my fan now."
5,Wood Pull Chains,These work great and are long enough I can now reach to turn on ceiling fan or the light.
1,12 INCHES LONG,"My ceilings are 9'3"" high. This chain is only 12 inches long. I do see that it mentions this in the description, but I really didn't expect a one foot long chain. The standard pull chain for a ceiling light fixture is something like three feet, so just be aware that this is NOT a standard length pull chain."
3,Only 15mg of isoflavones per pill,"The product seems to be good quality, but it is a little misleading. Each pill contains 750mg of soy germ, but only 2% isoflavones (15mg per pill). The price seems good, but it really is more expensive than many other products out there since the isoflavone content is much lower than many other products."
3,Funciona a largo plazo,"El producto se ve bien pero no tiene la potencia de otros productos de su mismo componente, algo asi como generico. Igual por el precio se ve bien."
5,power in a small package,"The TroyBilt blower packs a punch & will definitely consolidate some leaves. Only issue for some might be the weight & vibration over extended periods. However, a shoulder harness makes the weight manageable."
5,great product & service,"Got this product for a shower gift at a great price from chef's kitchen. very nice product and wonderful service, shipping on time, etc."
5,The best!,"Love love love these cups and this flavor is the absolute best. They've stopped carrying them at the store I usually buy them (the one with the little red dot inside the the big red circle...you know, a 'moving ____' or '______ range' or even 'I used a big arrow and put it on my bow and bit the bullseye on the _____.' Right?Anyway, these are the bomb and I pray Amazon keeps carrying them."
4,Easy Breakfast or Snack,"I store several of these at work for when I need a quick breakfast or snack. They work great, because they container works as a bowl. All you need is hot water and spoon. The flavor is good, but I took 1 star away because the amount of oatmeal in each container isn't quite enough."
3,"Amazing fingerstyle guitar, but lose the string arrangements","I first heard Mr. Dykes on an acoustic guitar sampler CD--his contribution was a piece entitled ""Hurricanes, Earthquakes, and Tomatoes,"" and it blew me away. It combines incredible technical skill with lovely musicality. That one song is simultaneously cerebral, emotional, subtly intricate, and over-the-top fun. A true tour-de-force.The same level of musicianship is evident on Gitarre 2000, but here the tone is much more introspective. Which is fine...until the strings start. Quite a few pieces are overloaded with string arrangements that are annoyingly bland.I don't regret the purchase, and I do hope to enjoy Doyle Dykes' phenomenal talent on other recordings, but I sure hope he lets his solo guitar sing (and whisper, and shout, and purr) without muddying the works with elevator string arrangements."
5,"Gitarre 2000, the CD is fantastic!","In Gitarre 2000, with the use of some different guitars than in previous albums, it seems that Doyle Dykes is able to ""cut loose"" just a bit more. This CD is just more evidence of the gift and genius of the man, his heart, and his inspiration. Check out the new ""perfect"" recording of The Lord's Prayer on this CD. It's hard enough for a whole orchestra to be able to express the musical dynamics of this song. Yet, here is one man with only one guitar, and he can play a deluge of notes with power while achieving his trademark warm, clean tone."
1,Just not the same as the first Amber series with Corwin.,"If you love the first series of Amber books, featuring Prince Corwin, then I personally suggest you skip reading this second series, which is about his son Merlin. Zelazny goes so far away from what he started out with, it just doesn't make any sense at all at the end...even for sci-fi/fantasy! Even if you could ignore the fact that the second series just doesn't follow the same plot lines as the first, there are still just too many unanswered questions at the end of this series. And believe me, if you desire to know what becomes of Corwin or the ""new"" pattern, you will be greatly disapointed. So, whenever I'm in the mood for a trip to Amber, I pull out the Corwin series. The second series, I threw in the trash."
1,Should have stopped at Corwin...,"I agree whole-heartedly with the guy from Houston. This book is trash. Nothing against Zelasney, but after the first series the pressure was on for ""more Amber, more Amber"" and you can tell that he was stretching to give what the public wanted. This series should have never been written, as it leaves a bad taste in your mouth due to the COMPLETELY uninspired and dissappointing outcome of the beloved Corwin and his pattern. Also...Merlin isnt Corwin, and that's that. He just isnt interesting. And Chaos isnt Amber...IT isnt nearly as interesting. Finally...for the die-hard Amber fans that havent read these books...they will just piss you off and rain on the parade that was books 1 through 5. If you havent had the pleasure of reading about Prince Corwin, however...you never know."
5,Track List,1. 9:31 Arioso from Cantata #1562. 6:18 Sonata #1 Second Movement3. 6:12 Praeludio from Sonata #74. 6:40 Sonata in G Major5. 10:50 Air from the Suite in D Major6. 6:49 Cantabile from Sonata #37. 12:37 Concerto #1 in D Major
4,The Battle to Stop Playing Has Begun...,"This was a great game. I first had it for the PC, a horrible and regrettable mistake, for the graphics were distorted and there was to much lag. When I bought it for XBOX, and turned on the console, I was amazed. There was so much detail, and the gameplay was faster and more playable. There are some CONS to this game too, such as you can only play as 20 different types of soldiers, the levels are too few and too limited, and you can't play as the Jedi Heroes that fight alongside you. The Co-op is a great feature that everyone should use. On the Historical campaign you both are on the same team, which In Galactic Conquest, a mode in which you go from planet to planet conquering everything in your path, and instant action mode, a mode where you can just choose which battle to fight, you can decide whether to be on the same or different teams. Overall, I am glad I bought this game for XBOX to add to my Star Wars Collection."
4,fun & easy,"this game is one of the best shooters i've ever played. no story, thats ok don't need it its a star wars copy of battlefield 1942. its a fun shooter vehicles for me easy to control..... but could be better,like maybe more vehicles &hope there is an expansion"
1,BIG Disappointment,"Like another reviewer said...I believed the hype, so I have no one but myself to blame. When the advertisements said that you could ""be ANY character in ANY battle using ANY weapon and ANY ship..."" I was dumb enough to believe it. It's true if ANY character is any NAMELESS character from battles, most of which were not inthe movie.Um, hello? Lucasarts?! No one wants to play Rebel Sniper #1...they want to play Luke Skywalker, Han Solo or Darth Vader. They don't want the same battle time and time again (capture the Command Posts again?!) - they want to be in the Death Star dogfight in an X-Wing, or flying the Millenium Falcon through the asteroid field. That's what the hype indicated we could do. Come out with THAT game for Xbox, and I'm all over it.I'm returning this one."
3,good but sucks,First I was so excited to get this game and it says 120 stages and only played 12 stages whats wrong with lucas arts they told a fat lie man but if your a fan that like star wars but if you try it it only has 12 stages also I beat the whole game and you cannot I repeat cannot play as jedi and they are hard to kill this game is not fun.
5,best starwars game ever!!!,first off i do not own the game have just rented it several times. I really want this game. it is great that you get to choose sides and not just play as the good guys. i love homing spider droids even though they are quite weak.
5,Star Wars Battlefront is my new favorite Xbox Game!!,I think this game rocks because I can use the force to knock out The Rebel Allliance. The other thing is that this game is so fun to play on my Xbox and I can pick what sides to play for and I picked the Galactic Empire! This game rocks! Star Wars is #1!
2,Star Wars Battlefront,"Unlike in the movies, on this game you can't play Jedi. There should be more character choices and different types of weapons."
3,great game for all big gamers out there,finominal if kids ask for this for any acassion get it for them they will be so idicted to the game they will be off your backs for a long time i garintee that
1,As disappointing as the most recent movies,"This game is POOR. Chalk me up as a mark ... a victim of the hype. I'm not a hardcore gamer but the concept sounded interesting. Hook, line, sinker. (...). All you do in this game is run around shooting things up for NO GOOD REASON at all. If you hop in one of the vehicles, good luck trying to figure out who's on your side. There's NO STORY, very little correlation with the movies & really no reason to waste your time with this game because bottom line, it's BORING.(...)it's in your best interest to RESIST THE URGE and let this one go, just let it go."
4,Great game and concept,"I'll admit that being able to go around as a stormtrooper and kill everything in sight is fun. Wicked fun. This game delivers if you want to have a good time playing a FPS involving Star Wars. The major drawback to the game is the targetting. It's like using a sniper rifle in Halo 1 but the reticle is the size the one for the assault rifle. You can turn on the auto-aim option to help with accuracy but then the reticle tends to follow an enemy on screen and it's more difficult to shoot over an ally's shoulder. Another drawback is that you can't jump/fall and shoot at the same time like in other FPSs. Plus, fighters are hard to learn how to use as are other vehicles. You can still do fine as a footsoldier but it would be nice if the vehicles were a little easier to use."
3,Pretty Cool,"This game is much better than any other star wars game I've played. It's cool to play as different people and be involved in different battles from the movie. You can get in most vehicles and even be a destroyer droid. One of the downsides, though, is the weird vehicle controls. But overall this game was pretty cool. (I'd pay 10-15 bucks for it)"
2,Nothing New At All,"If you own a favorite FPS then you will quickly tire of this game. My main issues are the menu are crap. Theres is no ""lobby"" such as GP2 or R6:BA. Hosting even a 4 player game with no bots from my dorm room (t1 equiv.) is even laggy. And why cant 'Heros' die??? Dont expect anything different. THeres no CTF or any 'game types' either.Even though i got the first update so far it still freezes on a blue screen. If I wanted that I would have bought a PC CHip mobo and installed Mac OS on it.The game play is great though. Starwars fans and non-fans will dig it. The music is cool as well. But they could have given us more than just run, shoot, crouch and jump. Dont get me wrong, the vehicles and such are great but youll quickly tire.Id go with the PC version. Youll be dissapointed reguardless but at least its got better graphics .Official Amazon Plug : Buy this game when you see it used on Amazon for less than twenty bucks."
5,great game,this game rocks especially the at-at and the at-as and the republic gunship those are the absolute best and the snowspeeder so get this game
2,Disappointing...,"I had high hopes from this game. I'm a big fan of Halo and Rainbow Six, and also a Star Wars fan. So I expected this to be awesome. I was wrong. This game isn't in the same class at all. What I liked was the music and scenes from the movies. The gameplay is poor. The voice communication, which is superb on Rainbow Six, is choppy and cuts out. This one will be collecting dust on my shelf for sure. My advice, rent this one first to see if you'll like it."
4,Great game,"This game is the best-selling Star Wars game out there, and now I can see why. Being able to relive all of my favorite epic battles from the movies was an exciting and fun experience. All the classic vehicles were incorporated into the game like the AT-ATs, AT-STs,X wing, Y wing and many more! If you like large-scale multiplayer games then it is worth the money, but you may not want it if you're more of a single player person because just about all of the games' content was directed towards multiplayer gameplay. Overall this game is definetly a Star Wars fan MUST own, if you don't buy Battlefront you might be retarder...seriously I'm not joking you might be."
3,"Fun, but not what you think","First off, let's make this clear, STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT is not a real First-Person Shooter (FPS) -- not in the way of HALO, DOOM, or RAINBOW SIX. It's more like the Dynasty Warriors-hack-and-slash version of a FPS with just a dash of (just a little) strategy.It is a really fun game when you enter an all-out war filled with hundreds of soldiers (mostly controlled by the AI + whatever players have joined in) and anything goes. Wonder how movie heroes walk through a battlefield and not get attacked every second or see an attack from behind. Now you know. Strategy also helps (staying back and sniping 70 people may not win the day)The graphics are nice, the controls a little clunky but otherwise it's a great game. Just don't expect anything like Halo or Halo 2 because it's not that kind of game. If you are looking for that, better skip over this and get the upcoming STAR WARS REPUBLIC COMMANDO."
3,jangeo fetta,this is a war game but its as simple as walking my brother beat the empire levels in live three hours!!! i would sugest to buy this because it is sort of fun (you can't be jedi or sith like in battlefront 2)
3,A Good and Valid Criticism,"No book is perfect, not even Rich Dad, Poor Dad, so this book becomes a good and valid criticism of that book. That said, there is a great deal of worthwhile information in both books, which the author recognizes. Both are worth reading, but understanding that not everyone may become rich is also also a necessity."
4,"Garrow's Law, Entertaining and thought provoking","Garrow's Law, Series 1&2. are excellent!. One thing detracts from the viewing though. The background music is too loud, and doesn't seem to belong to the scene being viewed. Hard to explain that. The music seems to be random and makes no attempt to make a mood for the activity in progress. We do enjoy them very much, and wonder what a mightmare it must have been to be tried at the Old Bailey. I recommend these DVDs if you enjoy a historical look at justice back in the good old days."
2,True grit,"This a typically nasty television series, starting out with screaming and misery. A woman is railroaded in a crudely run court and is branded right in front of the judge, jury, and a howling audience. Along comes our hero, ready to create and distribute human rights. Good versus bad, and don't hold the cleavage. It's all quite predictable.Moreover, the music is far too loud. The hero's lines are sometimes difficult to understand. And the director often employs two second camera shots to keep the action rolling (and blind many viewers). All in all, this is not exactly wholesome or even interesting entertainment."
2,Less than expected,"Drama is too schetchy. Not enough meat to the story lines. As with a lot of American TV, there is a contest to see how much female breast can be shown. This means there is a lack of confidence in the story line, the direction and the acting."
4,English Law 19th century,"If you have studied the law, or are practicing the law, this series is interesting to see how the English judicial system evolved. Although it seems a little 'over the top' to our modern standards, it is still a rich review of how much conflict was caused in an effort to balance Prosecuting and Defense attorney perspectives. Whether judges had such heavy handed places in court is most likely true, as is the role/function that the Parliament played in persuading the outcome of topical issues/events that politically swayed in their personal favor. The romance portion of the story seemed to have been created to show how feminism has its place as far back as the 19th century court system.The series is enjoyable and I hope that further DVD's are created if the series continues in England."
5,Good historical video,"I bought this on a chance, some of the English videos do not have subtitles and are hard to understand. I bught both of the video for sale and enjoyed them very much. The story would have been easer to understand with subtitles. The acting was good, story interesting and played very well."
3,Correct...,This movie is a good movie and a action and suspense movie...the music is...BAD ! It's just this !
4,Successful play.,The quality of this DVD is fine. I was able to play it on my DVD players without any problem.
5,Panel Ball,I have a 12 year old select softball team! These Girls are young and they love things that are new. They really enjoyed the color on the balls because it kept their attention. It's a great training tool.
1,Predictable,"[...] figuring maybe my girlfriend would like it. It was hardly erotic, generally predictable and dull. A tough blond tries to take a nice person's job away from her. It doesn't work out; the tough blond also manages to have sex with a few simple minded males. Nothing creative about this film. Simulated sex has the usual positions, front, back, some oral. Who cares?This movie might have cast some real women in these roles, not the usual Playboy stereotypes. The script must have been written in 20 minutes."
1,NOT A SOCKET,"Just received this and I'm completely disappointed - it is not a socket at all, it is a drain plug! I thought I was ordering the socket to remove the drain plug, as the product title states."
2,Spellsinger's Mishaps,"the book wasn't exactly my taste. I've always liked Adriane.(I guess ""like"" isn't exactly right. I guess obsessed would do it.) But Kara and Adriane leared to like each other and trust each other.I noticed that Emily wasn't in the book a lot,either. Nor the animals of Ravenswood.By,Silver Uquq"
3,A Major Disapointment,"And I was actually starting to like Kara.If you like Kara, you might not after this book. She gets way toobsessed with this singer and lies, cheats, cuts classes, and steals. You do get a decent amount of foreshadowing but Karas acts make that not matter so much. Kara and Adrienne get into a big fight (what else is new) and ruins the whole book.I gave it three stars because the shapeshifter is important for the next book, and it does ok foreshadoiwing. I hope later books can make up for the way Kara acts."
2,Worst book Ever!!!!!!!!!,Ok well this book SUCKED!!! It's all about baribie kara. I was actully at first thinking Kara wasn't that bad for a character but beacause of this book now I think shes not a good character anymore. This book made me got really dissapionted. I really like the series and I will still continue reading the series but if she is going to steal Emily's horn AGAIN then I might as well not read anymore books about Kara.
3,My least favorite!!!,This book is NOT a good book. There is not enough magic and the main center of the book is Kara. That already puts it down in the marking. Kara just doesn't have the right to act like she is the Queen of the world. The only reason why I gave it three stars is because the ending is ok. Key word: OK.
1,HOR-RI-BLE,"Hi! I've been reading Avalon for quite a while and this was by far the worst. The only thing that lifts the book is the illustrations. I wanted a good interesting book that kept me happy and I thought this would be as interesting as the others. Boy was I wrong!! It all go's down hill from the beginning when pop sensation Johnny Conrad comes to Ravenswood fund-raiser. Kara acts like a total brat and disrespects all her friends. The wort part is she never even apologizes to Emily or Adriane. You might want to read this book because it gives lots of info for the next few books. In the end the book was a major disappointment.Love,Obsessed Avalon reader"
3,Another Great Avalon,"The three girls are once again trying to save Avalon. They have all been working together when Kara becomes a total loser and cuts classes, lies, and only cares about Johny Conrad, and is forgetting about Avalon, but Johny is really an evil skultum, and is faking the girls out. This is one of the best ones yet. But I give it 3 stars for some little kiddy content. Let's say when they sing at the end, it's supposed to be, you knoe, hip teens rocking out, but No. La, la, la, Avalon is cool. First of all, the other people out there really don't care about Avalon, and Be*Tween... if they know about Avalon, why don't you get them to help?"
3,HMM... Kara ehh?,I found this book Okay but I just didn't like the book. there was nothing magical. I can understand though that Kara took the jewel(unicorn horn). It's basicly about Em and the gang are having a band at Ranvenswood until this skultum comes after Kara well uses her to open the portal up Avalon. Kara betrays her friends and only cares about herslef.(like im surprised) I think for once Kara should be punised for all the things she did. Like lose all her magic though the series wouldn't be the same. I hope in Dark Mage Kara won't be the dar mage or else it 'll just be like in Scobby Doo Daphne always getting kidnapped(not like I watch the show!!!)
3,not what i expected...,"so it was an okay book. I never liked Kara anyway. Adriane was always my favorite. Kara is such a brat. This book was not what I expected it to be. The plot was okay, but I expected a much better plot. If you enjoyed the other books in this series, you'll be quite disappointed."
3,So-so...,"It helps with the immediate itching, but doesn't appear to last very long. Not to say it doesn't help somewhat, it's just you have to apply about every other day."
3,healthy skin,"I prefer Chlorahexidine based shampoos and conditioners for dermatitis issue skin but Hydrocortizone is often more readily availableand for basically healty skin with minor itchy allergy problems its a good product. It did not help any of my severe allergy dogs sores,hot spots, bumpy backs, etc and I've had allergy dogs for 20 years so have tried MANY different products. I would use this whensevere problems are under control as more a maintenace conditioner."
4,The Machine Isn't the Problem!,"I just read the post above in which another user blames the Lenovo 3000 J115 for slow performance.I bought my machine about a year and a half ago for less than 600 dollars from an Office Depot location, and I insisted it come loaded with Windows XP. I've upgraded the RAM to 1.5 gigs and installed another internal hard drive to give it a total of 750 gigs storage.I'm a high end video user. I edit using professional video applications and can easily mix graphics, photos, both standard and high definition video on a pro edit software platform. This little computer really is the machine that could. I've never had a problem.So, my guess is that the user above (or below, depending on the layout here!) is experiencing more of a Vista problem than a Lenovo problem. I heartily recommend the computer."
2,atrocious source print,"I would give this delightful ""time capsule"" double bill 5 stars if the transfers weren't so depressingly horrible. CURLY is a dreadful print, but at least it's watchable. DOC ROBBIN is so faded/overexposed that I couldn't bear to watch more than 5 minutes. This is the old 2color CINECOLOR process, which, granted, could never equal the perfection of the true 3strip Technicolor process. But miracles can happen by using today's technology. Look at the remaster of Lugosi's SCARED TO DEATH and you'll see the awesome results of what can be done with a CINECOLOR restoration. I'm going to shelve this DVD for a while in hopes that someone will come up with a pristine redo. Hal Roach Studios has been re-issuing some of their old titles using sparkling new prints--hopefully they'll get around to these 2 little gems someday soon...(as usual, the ALPHA packaging/artwork is absolutely gorgeous...)"
2,"Same Songs, New Cover","Freakout, Freakout Song, Nobody Likes Me,Science Fiction*.All of these albums have the exact same songs in the exact same order except for Science Fiction which has one additional song in the middle.song 3, ""I've written home to mother"" is a cut from ""Lay Down And Die, Goodbye"" as recorded by The Nazz (pre-Alice Cooper)The Two Stars go to the two good songs on the album.""Ain't that Just Like A Woman"" and ""Going Down To The River"".If you see this album, keep on walking past it.Unless You're a die-hard Alice fan and have to have it, which is why I picked up "" Freakout"" about 5 years ago."
3,Alice's Albatross,"I've been a fan of Alice Cooper's for about 25 years now and I like this album as the rabid fan that I am. Unfortunately for the uninitiated this is not a good place to start. Alot of people buy this album because it's cheap. In whatever form or title you purchase it as, this in not an official Alice Cooper album. This is a bootleg of the 1968 Toronto rock n'roll revival Alice played with John Lennon. This album has been titled ""Freak Out"", ""Snorting Anthrax"", ""Live In Toronto"" among other titles. The recording quality is not that good. Alice does not endorse this album, as a fan I can assure you that this product in it's many titles and numerous cover art adaptations is below the standard the Alice holds his work to."
3,A bit too familiar.........but good,"Good, but seemed a bit to predictable....might just be me, as I recently bought the DVD by Jason Robinson, and that was aimed at the same audience, but really, really funny and creative. If you like comedy, this one is good, but some of the newer guys like Jason Robinson, Godfrey, and Billy D Washington are the future."
5,Larry The Cable Guy DVD,Ordered aschristmas present and it came within 2-3 days of purchase very pleased!!! Only problem was my boyfriend bought the same thing for his mom :( oh well could be worse.
2,Standup use of the 5 funny words,"Maybe because I am past adolescence, but after 1hr and 15 minutes hearing the same 5 words used as a joke over and over, I was ready for Red Skelton. The normal words to trigger a laugh with pre-teens are; 1) SHI_ 2) FAR_ 3) AS_ and TI_. These covered 90% of his material. I am new to LARRY so I guess I just bought the wrong tape, I thought it was Jim Carry's stupid but funnier movie."
1,Never is there enough said about the racist past of Bowie,"Bowie was no hero! He believed in the establishment of a slave state. When Mexico abolished slavery in 1829, Bowie and the rest of the slave owning class declared war. The Battle for Texas Independence was a slave holder initiated war."
4,Reality Check for the Naive,"This book set me straight about public speaking. I haven't begun my public speaking career yet, which means I find this book filled with eye-opening guidelines that can only speed my progress to the podium. No book covers every base, but there are bases covered here that I didn't know existed. Good book."
3,"good on paper, but a mediocre event.","UFC 12 was a night of firsts in mma. This was the first event in ufc history to be not hold at least an 8-man tournament. The ufc decided for this event to set up two four-man tournaments and finally institute weight classes, a 199 & under class and a 200 & above. It was somewhat pointless however as the two winners, Jerry Bohlander and a debuting Vitor Belfort, were seperated by less than 5 lbs. It was a night when a heavyweight title was also created. Dan Severn fought Mark Coleman, who took over the spot of don frye, in a battle of two of the biggest competitors the ufc had seen up until that point. It was a letdown however as Severn was submitted rather easily by Coleman in under three minutes."
5,Love it,I love this product because clean doesn't have a smell and these crystals just magically evaporate and clean the air beautifully.I have two dogs and a son that plays football. believe me I've looked around for a solution.
2,OK Product,"You need to like the scent of this product, I think it is very different and may not be to everyones liking. Unless you give the container I good shake every once and awhile it seems to stop working after only a few days. When the product dries out it becomes like concret and is very difficult to clean."
2,Ok But just so so,"Way over priced for hat one gets... How does it work In my opine just so so.. Evaporates at a very fast rate. Does not kill the odor completely! Just cover it up for a while ?? Yes, I understand the source need to be correct, in my case it was but the odor lingers for a while and this product did not remove it as stated in the adv./Ad."
1,Yuck,"I thought this item smelled TERRIBLE!!!! If I could have given it NO STARS, I would have. Yes, it masked littler box odors, but it just made the whole room smell bad with it's awful odor. I returned it as soon as I could. I think the Bad Air Sponge works soooooooooooo much better. Even a Clean Linen Glade Plug-In smells better than this product. I don't know what the hype is about this product. I really thought it smelled awful. Terrible item."
3,A fun video for young children that love horses.,"My 3 year old daughter loves horses and ponies... and this video. We allow her to watch Pony Love as a reward or treat. She has an endless appetite for it; she even sings the songs from the video for her nursury school class. This video gets 5 stars from my 3 year old, and 3 from me."
5,The real Last Super,This is the way I feel the Last Super was really done. The setting is perfect. The colors are beautiful.
5,"A welcome gift, a riveting read","I was very impressed with this thorough yet well written history of the Navy. The USS Essex is a perfect vehicle for telling the story. I applaud Robotti and Vescovi on their accomplishments--fine research, even finer writing. Anyone with an interest in AMerica's fine history will appreciate this book"
4,"Patrick O'Brian, look out!","This book reads quickly and more like a novel than history. However, the information it contains is useful to the student of history. These two know their stuff, research well, and write concisely. I recommend it."
3,Leaves some interesting aspects of the Essex saga unexplored,"This is a very interesting book on a relatively unknown subject but as another reviewer has pointed out, only about half of this book is devoted to the Essex and of this half only one chapter is devoted to the events that led to the ship's destruction off the coast of Chile.In particular, the authors almost totally ignore the political-diplomatic implications of the presence of the USS Essex in South America in 1813-1815 in the context of the South American wars of independence and the War of 1812.Captain's Porter ""Journal of a Cruise made to the Pacific Ocean"" (unfortunately out of print) gives readers a much more interesting and complete account of the Essex saga."
4,Great keyboard,"I ordered this keyboard because it was cheap, USB, and looked nice. Upon receiving it, I'm pleased with it. Installation is a breeze, there are no drivers with it, XP recognizes it and installs it with no work on my part. It has an extremely slim profile with the legs down, and the feel and response of the keys is very nice.Two things keep me from giving this 5 stars.1. The space bar squeeks sometimes when it is pressed. I haven't been using the keyboard for very long, so we'll see if it goes away or gets worse.2. The backspace key is smaller than my previous keyboard's was. Because of that I end up hitting '\' quite often instead of backspace. Odds are I'll get used to it though.Outside of those two things, Kensington makes a decent keyboard, which will hopefully last for quite a while. All in all, it's a nice keyboard with a great feel to it."
2,"mushy, inconsistent keys","The keys on the one I received do not have a consistent feel across the keyboard. Several don't respond to the same level of pressure as the other keys. This makes the keyboard useless for someone who really types fast.This keyboard also mushy, in the sense that your keystrokes decelerate more quickly at the end of the stroke into a mush rather than a solid tap.In contrast, good keyboards for fast typing give increasing resistance up to a point and then less resistance down to solid contact at the bottom. You get a feel for where that resistance breaks (and the letter types), and you can type without hitting the bottom hard on most strokes. On a mushy keyboard like this one, you're never sure if your keystroke has registered, so after typing several sentences missing half the letters, you hit the keys harder to compensate.The spillproof design is interesting though. Not sure why more keyboards don't feature this."
1,Bonehead placement of keys ruins this keyboard,"If you aren't a totally once in a while keyboard user, i.e. once a week for a little while, BEWARE!!!!Whoever at Kensington decided to place the power on/off key where the pause-break key is on 99.9999% of other keyboards deserves to be fired.Once you get used to the bizarre placement of the keys on this keyboard, you have to re-adjust when you go use the keyboard at your relative's, friend's, internet cafe's, library or wherever.The Wake up, Sleep, Power, Print Screen, Scroll lock and pause-break keys are mis-located. Oh yeah, the backspace key, which is double wide on most keyboard, is only single wide on the KB4L, makes for real excitement when trying to do some serious, fast text editing. Why???? Why did they do that?"
4,"Excellent, but a quirky backspace key","This is a fantastic keyboard. The keys have the right weight and response, and the overall layout is perfect. The only problem I found was with the backspace key, which is half the size one would normally expect (i.e. It is the size of the ""a"" key instead of the tab or shift key). This is a bit problematic at times, and it's why I can't give the keyboard 5 stars. Otherwise, it is great and highly recommended."
1,"NOT, I repeat, NOT spill safe","Spills make this thing junk. Took an hour to tear it apart and clean it. The membrane is totally OPEN, thus the description is a lie. No metal backplate.Still have a D that works now and then. Soft flat keys that are mushy. Caps lock key that is always getting on when you DONT WANT IT.Not a key board for life, but a keyboard for the LAST time in my life."
4,great for when you get board of the way you type with the controller,great for when you want ps2 typeing to go fasterps. makes life easyer for you
3,no usb port,I just assumed that a usb keyboard would have a usb port for plugging in a mouse. This one does not.
3,key letters don't last long,"I have had this keyboard for 2 months and already several keys have letters worn off, my gateway anykey 2000 made in 1992 still has all letters crisp with no fading, really disappointed with this keyboard, key letters should last much longer than these have."
1,I hate it,"Was not worth the money, the design is bad. There are better keyboards out there for almost the same price."
1,Kensington hardware is infuriatingly poor,"Without warning or detectable reason, the Shift keys stopped working on my ""Keyboard for Life"" (give an ironic chuckle here, ha, ha). This is the third piece of Kensington hardware that has turned out to be frustratingly inferior. First was my wireless mouse that sometimes worked and sometimes didn't and caused software conflicts with other hardware until I removed it. Second was my Kensington trackball that also sometimes worked and sometimes didn't, despite my multiple cleanings and reboots. And third, and the last straw, was this keyboard. No more Kensington hardware for me."
5,Does exactly what it says!,Got this for my husband's desktop computer that he uses every day for hours on end. After going through 2 regular keyboards and losing them due to spills I decided to give this one a try. We are still using it to this day! It's lasted almost 5 years through multiple 'oops' moments and is still going strong. I wish they made wireless ones this durable.
2,"Too Stiff, But Built To Last","This keyboard is perfect if you hammer away for hours on end and are looking for something stiff and sturdy that feels like it will last for years. I, on the other hand, find it to be too stiff. It's an plain-looking, solidly-built thing, and I will keep it as a back-up, but this won't be a daily-use keyboard for me. It simply requires too much effort to press each key."
5,Goes with our dream trip someday,"This is a Christmas gift for my husband, a reminder of the trip down 66 we plan to take in a few years. Item is great for the price."
4,cute kids room decoration,"My son's room is decorated in a Cars 2 theme, so this sign was very fitting as a wall decoration. We have several other signs on the wall too, including one with his name. This sign was shipped on time by the seller and was in good condition. I did notice a small scratch on one side and one of the corners was bent downward slightly, but it is very possible that this happened during the shipping process. Overall, I like the sign and I would buy it again."
4,E-rotic rules!,"This album is really worth buying if you're an E-rotic fan.Although it's not as perverse as most of the other E-rotic albums,it includes a lot of great songs.For example ""Shenandoah"", with panpipe-music in the background,makes it a beautiful song with indian-style...but of course,there's also some fast party-tracks.It's worth buying!"
4,Beginners will love it too,Cherished Dolls to Make For Fun brings back some of the best loved patterns from the past in a very easy to use format. These toys will appeal to even the most modern kids if done in todays bright color combinations.Best of all they will be cherished without breaking the bank!
1,BS From A Right Wing Nut,"This is the type of BS that's at the heart of all the problems in America. It's the crucible of stupidity, ignorance, and bigotry that keeps being disseminated into the minds of the least rational of us. The individuals who made this select piece of trash hope to persuade those who have no real command of the facts, and who enjoy conspiracy theories, into thinking our President is leading us into some peril that we just can't see! Big business pays for this junk, and Right Wing weirdos supply all the backward thinking. This is the stuff that, frankly speaking, the Taliban would write to indoctrinate their beguiled into doing their bidding and serve some insane agenda.This film is made by anti-Americans hoping to create civil unrest and fear. It's just the same dimwit material you'd expect from Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, or any other low-tier morons.At best, it's geared towards 2nd graders and people who eat their boogers."
1,crash and dash propaganda flick,"2016 is no more than a crash and dash propaganda piece the republicans have obviously hoped would tilt votes their way, although their favorite medium remains am radio, which can be economically sustained and concentrated on the american illiterati. progaganda, as hitler has stated in his ""mein kampf"" (my struggle) is cited by adolph as an indispensable instrument of totalitarian power, together with others our not at all ""neo"" fascist gop exercises as a matter of tried and true protocol. ayn rand and machievelli are not their ONLY bedside reading. this limp ""october surprise"" comes as none at all, and i am certain has changed few, if any, opinions. in onder to be effective, such propaganda must be saturating and continuous, in order to drown out opposing ideas and voices. which is why the gop has been constrained to unleash this flood of it. they have a LOT of lying to do."
1,"Only if you like pure popoganda, and/or are a fan of Goebbels news reels","It is difficult to say what is most disturbing about this ""documentary,"" and I use that word only because I don't want to use vulgarity. If you are not as susceptible, paranoid, and ill-informed as D'Souza might be and/or D'Souza hopes his audience is, then the facts presented in this documentary are definitely NOT what will disturb you; also because they are not facts. Whether it be the histrionic dramatization of the importance of the information, the undeniable misrepresentation of realities, or D'Souza's personal obsessions, there is a lot to find disturbing. I will say this, the film is a masterpiece of the use of fear, as a method of manipulation for economic/political gain.""Exemplum de simia, quae, quando plus ascendit, plus apparent posteriora eius""--Saint Bonaventure (He doth like the ape, that the higher he climbs the more he shows his arse)I highly recommend you avoid paying any money to see it!"
5,Tell All,Thank you Amazon for providing some of the best movies around. The fact that I was able to purchase this movie and have facts presented in a factual manner was excellent. Thank you AMAZON for providing these products.
2,"Right direction, weak research, wrong facts, and quite boring","I gave this film two stars not because I disagree with the conclusion drawn, but because of how weak the research is and how little substance it contains (and because it is quite boring). If you really want to get an insight into Obama's past and real agenda (which I happen to believe is even more destructive than presented in the film), watch Dreams From My Real Father; that will wake you up and put to rest all the distractions from the real issues that have been brought up (the birth certificate, the relationship with questionable characters such as Wright, Ayers, etc., Obama's and Michelle's real accomplishments or lack thereof, the history of Obama's part in Chicago politics, and so on). For what it's worth, I don't think the implicit alternative (the other candidate?) will be all that much better :)"
4,"Seems slow for the first 30 minutes, but well worth it in the end.",Check it out BEFORE you vote. Its not radical propaganda. Maybe it will make you love Obama maybe it will make you hate him.
1,2016 from Amazon,Very disappointed in this. Didn't add anything to existing knowledge. Promos indicated it would be awesome. I found parts of it extremely boring.
3,It's okay!,"I like the educational background of the movie. But I still don't know much about who Obama really is, or what his agenda is for America."
3,As Expected,"Lots of advertising hype but nothing new. I have nothing more to say, this is just to satisfy the word requirement of this review"
5,"Watch, then email 3 Friends","I just watched this movie. OMG, riveting. The movie is well done, incredibly well done and compelling. It lays bare who influenced Barack Obama in his influential years, and finally makes available to the American public a fact-based presentation of his ""goals"" and idealogy when he says ""level the playing field"" and ""fundamentally change America"". It gives thought to exactly what is in store for America if he manages to get reelected (I pray not). I watched this movie, then sent an email to three people, explaining my reasoning why they should watch this movie NOW. I hope others do this as well, spread the word. Thankfully this movie is available from Redbox. Even those who ""love"" him, should see the movie, if out of nothing but curiosity. Love Him or Hate Him, you must see this movie."
5,Thought Provoking Film,This is one film every American should see. The Director provides a cogent argument as to why President Obama is the person he is. Regardless of your political ideology you should watch this film.
5,Another Masterpiece from Dinesh D'Souza,"Dinesh D'Souza did his homework and takes us into Obama's past, present, and the probable future if he retains power in the White House. One thing I really appreciated about this film was that it examines Obama's life and beliefs without being mean-spirited. There are no personal attacks, hateful remarks, or unfair shots. Everything is calmly and easily laid out in a conversational manner, sucking the viewer in without insulting their intelligence. There's also nothing in here about Romney or any Republican candidates. This is solely Obama's film and he is the main focus. - Time Warp TARDIS reviewI'm a big fan of Dinesh D'Souza after reading some of his books. He has a gift for artfully crafting his arguments with sound logic and doesn't resort to partisan remarks. If you like Charles Krauthammer, then you'll like Dinesh D'Souza."
5,Obama's Secret Revealed,"2016 Obama's America brings crystal clarity to four years of the strange, Un-American domestic and foreign policies that we have seen as a result of electing a President based on affirmative action instead of qualification."
4,Disgusting People,"This book was so informative, it almost makes youwant to throw up ! It is amazing how many people in this""United States"" can be so blind to the awful personBarack Hussein Obama is!"
5,Good documetary,Interesting and informative. Different take on the view of the future of the country. Recommended for the politically minded everywhere.
4,Obama's America,Interesting material that makes you think.It gives information that was not in the mainstream and I wish everyone could have seen it.It would give conspiracy theorists a field day.
2,2016,It was interesting. I don't think it proved the points conclusively that the filmmaker was trying to drive home. I did not vote for Obama in either election but this would not have influenced me had I had any questions about him. A lot of speculation and putting the filmmakers thoughts into what he perceived as fact.
3,View into a side of Obama not many have seen,"A view of Obama's past that haven't been seen before but,still we have much more to learn about the man"
5,You get the govenment you deserve,"An excellent documentary that puts into perspective and explains the ideas and policies which make absolutely no sense for the well-being of America. Then you realize, it is not the well-being of America that is Obama's priority, and this documentary explains why. I first saw this at the theatre and there were four people there, including myself. One woman left in the middle of it. Guess she wasn't hearing what she wanted. As I was leaving the theatre, I commented to a woman walking behind me, ""Scary stuff."" She said, ""Yes. And you know what else is scary? That we were the only three people in the theatre."" If you know of any undecided's, suggest that they watch this. Do it for your country."
4,2016 Obama's America,I wish everyone would have to see this but in America we can close our eyes to things we don't want to acknowledge It was very interesting. I would recommend it for all..
4,Review,I received the product promptly and enjoyed it throughly. I highly recommend this dvd. It is both educational and rewarding to watch.
2,Interesting,The movie was a little slow giving a lot of in depth background not only on Obama but also on the author. It did provide an interesting contrast between a minority individual that come to this country from another country and a minority individual that was born in the county. It also points out that President Obama's perspective of being black in the US is totally different and unlike the experience of other blacks living in the US.
2,Eh.,"I was not really impressed by this movie. I felt like it was trying really hard to make you believe that the president hates America. I don't think he hates America, he is doing what he thinks is best for America (whether right or wrong). The movie was mostly propaganda. Like everything else."
1,"Was excited, ended up disapointed","I love a good conspiracy theory, so I was excited when I heard about this movie. I bought it right away and spent 2 hours wondering when it was going to get to the good part. Waste of money. It did not deliver the suspence or ask the questions I was hoping for. I never do reviews but it was so horrible I just want to b***** about wasting my money on it :) save yourself."
5,Sad but true !,"Tells it like it is !!!......we are in for a very grim future if the prevailing ""gimme free stuff"" continues - be it only for a couple years...."
5,Well it is an eye opener.,"I understand now Who our President is and Why he is the way he is and where he gets his thinking from. I think this movie was done in very good taste. It really was not bashing Our President it was giving you a look into his life and Where his ideas come from. I still feel we are loseing our Country , our Rights and our Place in the world as a leader. Because of our President, We have lost our place in the World. I'm sorry but I think he was not what the people felt he was. His non- experience at really anything, should have excluded him from being President of this Great Country, Of Which we are not anymore do to him."
5,spot on !,"it shows him for what he really is. every one should view this. martin luther king, jr told us not to judge a man by the colour of his skin but by the content of his charicter."
5,why you voted this way,everyone should see this! then you will know why you should not voted this man into office too late if you did.
3,Really didn't learn anything new to change my opinion,The video was interesting and well done but the information provided was much of what I had heard or seen in the past. Worth watching if you aren't too familiar with this man but doubt that it will change your opinion positively or negitively.
5,2016 Obama;s America,Loved it. I missed it at the movies when it played. It enlightened me about his thinking of certain events and why he thought the way he did. I realize all the Democrats will say it is just lies and will not believe a thing contained in it.
5,Very informative,I thought this information was very helpful in understanding the mindset of President Obama. I rated this 5 stars because I feel that it's a very thoughtful and well done documentary.
4,MOVIE EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD WATCH 2012,YOU CAN WATCH THIS MOVIE QUICK. PAY & WATCH.GIVES YOU SOME INSIGHT.I STUDY ALL COUNTRIES AND USA IS GOING TO BE GOING THROUGH EVEN MORE CHANGE.EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE.ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIVE IN U.S.A.
5,Very well done.,Well researched and produced. This really explains why obama acts and thinks like he does. This amplfies my shock and disappointment in American voters who elected him again.
2,OBAMA AMERICA,"I was very disappointed in this movie. While it did answer a few questions about Obama and gave you some insight into the man, I was expecting a lot more. It seemed it was more about Dinesh than Obama."
4,Obama's America,It's too bad D' Sousa couldn't have put this movie together about 5 yrs ago. Could've saved the country alot of greif. A real eye - opener.
4,obama's communist america,"B0094V8OXG This just confirms, what i suspected 4 years ago. If you want America to stay a free country, get rid of obama. Time well spent to watch this."
5,2016 Obama's America,This is a film everyone should see if they truly care about America and want to know the man we call President.
5,Important Film about an Illusive Politician,"This film gives good background on a president who the modern media refuses to approach in a journalistic way. What the public gets from the media is ""Jersey Shore"" journalism - like the TV show, all we've seen is emotion + in your face dialog + a little sex thrown in. This documentary gives the ""who-what-when-where-how"" of traditional journalism. I was impressed by the parallel between the author and Obama - similar backgrounds with very different outcomes. My personal belief is that the president will imperil the country in his second term - and its been like the Wizard of OZ - pay no attention th the man behind the curtain."
5,Interesting theory. Very well researched.,A frightening theory to explain some of Obama's unusual actions as president. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in understanding Obama's disturbing familial history.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"this movie is a biased from the start. D'Souza has an agenda from the beginning. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time watching this film, but if you do play close attention to the misleading manner D'Souza asks questions by ""leading"" the interviewee to agree with his interpretation of facts. We all grow up with a view of our parents, but this doesn't mean we will always recapitulate their actions and beliefs. I am not a supporter of the President on many issues, but I am smart enough to know quality from trash and this movie is most definitely the garbage!"
1,A Neoconservative Fiction,I thought this would be an even-handed documentary imagining what the outcome of President Obama's policies would look like at the close of his possible second term. What I got instead was a grand conspiracy evocative of Tea Party extremists who believe that President Obama hates America. I made it to the end only out of curiosity.
5,You Owe it to Your Country to Watch,"Very, very well done. No matter who you voted for in 2008, no matter who you plan to vote for in November, you owe it to yourself, you owe it to America, to watch this movie."
4,"Some flaws, but convincing in the main","Disclaimers: I receive nothing at all for this review. I have seen the movie twice in theaters but not the DVD.This movie gives more time to ""the roots of Obama's rage"" in a psychological examination than is worth doing. The conclusions do amount to a theory that explains what are otherwise odd and contradictory policies and procedures. The movie explains Obama's anti-colonialist dislike of the United States that is convincing and is hard not to sympathize with. More refutation of it would have been welcome.Obama's brother George seems to be a smart man; I wanted to read his book after seeing his exchange with D'Souza.The movie concludes that Obama is a dangerous person to have in the White House, and sells the conclusion well, despite some stylistic problems and emphasizing some things at the expense of others. I hope all thoughtful Americans who will vote will see it, and those who disagree will compose some sound criticisms of it."
3,Interesting,"Can't hold a person accountable for their parents actions , but brings out the question of the media never mentioning any of these facts. Good flick. Held my interest. I'm still disgusted that obama was reelected. Like Bush said; Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. ( or in this case, all of y'all who vote for this charlatan )"
3,Interesting View of Obama,D'Souza leads the viewer thru Obama's background and allows the viewer to make/draw their own conclusions. I am not an Obama fan so this look at him was interesting but not very complimentary. Obama won the elction despite a poor economic performance so it is clear that the general public does not care about hs socialist background. This movie will fade into oblivion.
5,Use your OWN brain!,Please see this movie or read the book. I've done both. If you let others form your opinion then you have had your power taken away. Remember knowledge is power. Don't be a follower.
1,propaganda,"Pure and simple, this is propaganda, in its truest definition. Graphic images and dramatic music highlight the author's thoughts so as to draw the viewer's attention into a correlation of thought.I am not a Democrat. I am an informed viewer. This ""movie"" is pure bullsh*t to feed those who believe that everything is Obama's fault. Frankly, I'm sorry I paid four dollars to view this just to have an informed opinion.I give this one star for effort."
4,movie review,This was recommended to us by friends and family. We found it informative and timely. We would recommend this to others to watch as well.
4,Interesting,I thought it was a good movie. It helped explained some things that I had already suspected about him. Great movie for to watch before the election.
4,Very insightful,"Incredible movie and I have suggested it to friends and family. Very credible. Very insightful to the ""why"" of the things this president does. A MUST see."
5,Obama's 2016,"Was very eye opening, I wish that everyone could see it, and understand what could happen in our country, if we don't take a stand for freedom."
4,2016 - the movie,"Well done although not five-star produced; informative; creative, insightful. May God bless and keep the USA in spite of our government."
2,Who is Dinesh???,It always amazes me how people make up their on truths and try to pass them as facts. This is unbelievably biased and factually inaccurate. If you ARE looking for a good fictional docudrama about President Obama then this is for you. But if you are looking for facts and truth then keep it moving!
5,I recommend the book also.,I felt the video did a fine job of compressing the book into a good length. The subject would be shocking I think to a lot of people. I like the narrator/author's calm delivery. I would recommend this to any American Citizen.
1,A Fantasy from the mind of Danesh,"If you want to see a good fantasy, check out this film This film fits well into the factless world of the tea party. It would be enjoyed by those who take in a steady diet of Fox Noise."
2,who knew,I think the content was ok .. but the music was way too loud causing distraction to content. most the subject matter has been all over the net. so nothing was learned. i cant stand to watch him on tv or even listen to his lies.He gags me
5,all true,"obama is destroying america and too, many people are still his sheeple..they haven't a clue..some know who he is and those are the socialist that want america changed, but a lot of people voted for him that are swept away by his charma and his smooth words"
5,Obama's 2016,Now if the people who really need to watch this movie would and would do so with an open mind!! I saw this movie in the theater and look forward to seeing it again. Much of the movie is in Obama's own words. There is much that is not known about the President and reporters don't care to look into his past. I have never seen anyone that was NOT vetted like this man has been.
1,Made/produced well but lacking real relevant ideas and facts,"The movie is produced and made well but it is like a fairy tale story, i was lost many times about ""Facts"" or issues that were brought up and i had no idea where they came from and there was nothing even online to back them up. As i said the money behind the firm made it seem true and relevant but please look up the facts they state and do your own research."
1,Mostly falsehoods and conjecture,"An astonishing stretch of the director's imagination with some ""support"" from weak psycho-analytic opinions ofa few ""psychologists"". ""Triumph of the Will"" was no better a propaganda piece than this piece of garbage.Be careful of those who believe the claims made in this film, for they are the most likely to be manipulatedby the right-wing and will be capable of anything."
1,you see what you want to see,"this movie is written and directed to arouse and solidify an audience with their mind made up long before they watched it.Full of conjecture and theories specifically penned so that they are difficult to dismiss or disprove, but, more importantly, impossible to prove. With little more than an opinion and raging dislike for a man who's politics are not the same as the writer, this is a product of a hateful mind unable to see both sides of the issues. NOTHING is gained in watching this, unless you are trying to waste some time. Find a true, unbiased account of the President, watch with an open mind and form your opinion, on your own, with facts. You'll find nothing of the kind in this propaganda for the closed minded who will consider nothing but their own perception of the world."
2,"Just Keynesian economics, nothing to be afraid of.","The film was a disappointment. There are two schools of Economic thought, Salt and Fresh water economics. That's it. Obama is a classic Salt Water guy (Harvard, MIT, USC, etc). People who have little or no understanding of Economics revert to conspiracy theories, principles and ideals. Obama's presidency is nothing new, he simply is pushing the economic policies we had in place during the Golden Age (recall, even the much beloved Republican President Nixon (;^) said he was himself a Keynesian). What this means is, if there is no middle class, there is no one to sell to, which is why GDP was higher during the Golden age than any other period in history. But I digress... the movie does have some interesting takes, but for the vast majority of it, this movie is just another fact-less fun food for the far right."
1,OMG,"Have you no shame? This is just more of the vile extremist propaganda that has sadly become the norm only now we can add racist to the description. Use your brains people and I mean your frontal cortex, not just your amigdala."
2,Nothing New,The information featured in this DVD/Download is nothing that I haven't heard before--maybe all of the stuff that I've heard comes from this author. In the end I wasn't unimpressed; I just wasn't impressed.
2,Very dissapointing.,"I expected more factuality in this film, it was not at all what it was advertised to be. I could have done a better job."
1,Awesome if you like propaganda.,"This video is essentially a GOP propaganda video. It does nothing, but perpetuate more of the same vitriolic hate that plagues this country today."
1,Stupid,Do not purchase. One sided view that does not talk about what is promised from the title. A waste of 4 dollars.
1,And I base this on absolutely nothing......,"A film which goes on and on and on about Obama's father. The film tells nothing about Obama except ""what do we really know"" (apart from his entire life history which was spent in the US). The film also fails to show any connection between the beliefs of Obama's estranged father and Obama himself, yet clearly states that Obama is highly influenced by these beliefs - based on absolutely nothing. Classic bait and switch - no new evidence or facts."
3,OK so you tried to call out all the flaws of OBAMA,"I am not sure how I should address this video, as it may seem quite intriguing in believing OBAMA might be spawned from nothing with good intentions for the American people...... BUT then again which president of the United States did not have some skeletons in his closet.As I know for a fact the Bush administration (REPUBLICANS) has done nothing but put America into trouble where we can hardly breathe above water. The OBAMA administration inherited something that will take years to correct. Like seriously Dinesh D'Souza, get a life and stop trying to beat on a dead horse."
2,"little facts, lots of opinion","It's hard to believe that we pay for this biased reporting. Little facts, lots of personal feelings, probably propaganda. More like henny-penny, the sky is falling. Doom and gloom. I like a little more positiveness instead."
2,Won't watch it most likely!!,"Both presidential candidates are idiots at this point in the election. Being president may be among the toughest job to have, but come on, we have lost all touch with our roots. The biggest problem is no one seems to care or be doing anything about it. Obama has made mistakes, but who hasn't. Bush made the biggest ones, and basically left his mess for Obama to clean up. I'm not trying to defend Obama as I don't like any presidents we have had in my life that I can remember. Even if they made a movie about Romney, I wouldn't watch it, and I'm a conservative independent."
5,Scary,"Scary and thought provoking. Wish it were promoted countrywide, more than it was when in the theatres. The outcome may have been the same, but curious if it would have been different if more people were informed."
5,The truth is revealed,I watched this 2 times so far. Lots of great information and am pleased that this work has been done!
4,It was OK. Not exactly what I expected after hearing all of the Hype!,The film was an expose of the influences over Obama's life to where he is today. What he believes and why he believes it. It was a good movie. I guess that I just expected more on what life would be like after he was reelected in 2012.
3,Informative,Very informative. Gave real insight into the man and his beginnings. It helped me decide my vote and more about Obama as a person and why he is who he is.
3,2016. Obama's America.,"I hate to see the socialist adgenda of our government, one that our children will be dealing with more so than my retired generation."
4,2016 Obama's America,ThisDVD needs to be seen by every American in our great nation . It depicts where Obama's roots are and how he was raised along with his mentors. A must see by everyone. You will be amazed and shocked.
1,Nothing new,"I still do not agree with Obama, however, the depiction of his brother was misleading. The story is as much as most people expect, Obama did not grow up in America, he grew up abroad or in the developing nation of Hawaii (ask anyone who has served in Hawaii and they can tell some of the weird stuff that goes on there politically).If you like him you still hate this movie, if you dislike him you really learn nothing watching this movie."
1,Racism disguised as Journalism,Can we please get past this? This is not your Grandparents WASP country anymore. It is a melting pot like never before and we sorely need cooperation. Trash like this is what is holding us back and whoever is responsible for this tripe needs to be shunned and ignored.
3,Hardest choice.,"I voted today and came home. My wife had dinner ready; I played with my son. Later I sat down and came across this film. I gave the movie three stars, not because of it's workmanship; it's actually excellent. I gave it three stars because I am a Democrat who voted for Barack Obama four years ago and today I with great remorse voted for Mitt Romney. I could not shake the feeling that our nation is headed down the wrong path. It's the feeling you get when you think you've missed the exit sign on a strange interstate. You think you're lost but not sure yet and even less sure about how to get back on track. The realism of the movie and the disappointments of today don't make me happy. I wasn't happy to vote for Mitt Romney I was unhappy that I couldn't vote for Barack Obama. Thank you for helping me feel better about what I knew I had to do today."
4,HMMMMMM,"To rate this DVD I would say it was informative, but most intelligent people with their eyes open and blinders off would know most of what the DVD talks about. And i will leave it at that. It is hard to talk about this DVD as the subject is very controversial and so I won't make this a political review i will leave it at that....."
5,A True Flaw in a Man.,I like the fact it is coming from a Legal Immigrant's point of view. Only God knows how far we will fall. It's worth the time to watch 2 1/2 hrs.
4,Remarkable,"This movie was by far more informative in one and one half hours, than the mainstream media has been in four years about the poser and chief. Well worth the rental and well worth the time."
3,Not that informative,"Purchased this for my mother-in-law who was dissapointed in the DVD. Not that great. Didn""t really like it. Just okay"
3,Music overpowered the narrative,"The background music was so loud on the DVD that it was very difficult to hear the narrative. While I appreciate the content in this DVD, I only wish it was easier to hear what was actually being said. This dvd gives the viewer a clear picture of just how this man plans to take over America and turn it into a socialist nation. It gives very good clues so one can be aware of what's actually happening behind the scenes in politics. This is a must watch video for anyone who cares about the direction that America is going. After seeing this video, the viewer will know and watch out for the things our politicians are doing to ruin this once great nation. Take heed and make sure you pay close attention to the content of this video."
3,Kinda wishy-washy,"Didn't include many things that Obama had said on TV.Such as You did not build your business, someone else did that.I don't remember him or other Government personnel helpingme out when we started in the year 1975 of our lord"
2,Nothing I did not already know,"If you watch the news and keep up to date on what is going on, you probably won't learn much from this film. But, if you don't know anything about Obama, the movie is worth your attention."
5,Must Watch!,This country has seen a lot of bad things happen to it over the last 4 years. Now you know why. Obama.
4,2016 Obama's America,"This movie contained most of the material we had already seen on show's airing on the FOX NEWS network, but it was good to have it all in one DVD. We shared it with friends and family. I like that it ties everything together, but am NOT an Obama fan."
5,The Real Facts,"Every American should have viewed this DVD before you voted. The truth revealed by D'Souza was plain and simple due to His on authentic on sight interviews ( no hearsay here ). TOO LATE AMERICA, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE IN FOR ! I could say more but our freedom of speech will be next to be taken away from us along with many other freedoms that this country was founded upon by our for Fathers."
5,2016 should win an award for best documentary!,"Excellent production,with amazing sound, filming, interviews etc. Now understand this man's hatred of America, his desire to collapse our economy, all rooted in his views of our history of colonialism."
3,Alot of information about Obama's prior life.,"This movie was informative and interesting. It let me know something about Obama, since there is not much out there about his growing up years and his family. It brings him across as a real socialist formed by ideas from his father that he did not even know."
2,Just bought this for my son for Christmas,"I wanted to watch this and form my own opinion. And I wanted to watch AFTER the election. So I bought it for Christmas for my adult son. After we finished watching, he said one thing: ""Well I think I want my 90 minutes back"".Although this info is all probably true, I still find it slanted. And if you hit pause and look at some of the graphs and depictions of data, they are deceiving. I would give specific examples, but I think I've lost enough time on this video."
1,partisan drech,"somehow, i thought that this film would be enlightening to obama's way of thinking. but it is really just a piece of partisan drech. it's not in anyway objective or enlightening. it's simply ridiculous conjecture to paint obama as some kind of communist/socialist. just simply stupid and a full wast of my $4. if you have an open mind whatsoever, you will find this narrow and idiotic."
5,Masterful Depiction/Will scare the heck of you,"Very well done. Thought provocing. Makes you think twice about the possibilities. A definite video to be watch by all. A little to late for this past election, but sure will give you something to consider in the future."
4,Eye opening,This was a frightening revelation to me. I believe everyone who wants to know their president just a little better should watch this. In an unbiased approach Dinesh D'Souza reveals pieces of our president's life that lifts the veil for us to see what shaped and formed this national leader. A must see!
3,Conservative spin on a political collectivist.,"Let's just say it; the President is a collectivist-statist who is against the Constitution -- not unlike the Federalists (vis a vis Adams's Alien & Sedition Acts and Hamilton's worthless paper currency). His words and actions transmit this fact. This film, however, adds little to help me understand the President's soul. Watch it only if you are curious."
1,Most of this movie had been debunked,"For all of you sheep raving about how eye-opening this movie is, I suggest you go do some research about how most of it has been debunked and twisted. This is no different from Fahrenheit 911."
1,One Sided Opinion!,"Not even worth the one star you have to give, it is fine to look into the future,wonder if he knows the lottery numbers? but he does not look at the alternative Romney, a man who seems to put his personal wealth his priority, if not why will he not release his taz returns for a much longer period than two years like other Presidential candidates? what has he to hide. Yes we have high unemployment figures the UK and Europe also have the same problems, but Mitt Romney is one of those guilty of making workers unemployed whenever he has taken over companies, he has been totally ruthless, the book or movie do not look at this or if he may have money offshore? No the election of Romney will look after the Super Rich, perhaps he will take the country to war with an attack on Iran to keep the rich in military supplies pockets lined!"
1,An example of right wing propaganda. paid for as political mind messaging,"propaganda by radical right wingers, pure & simple ! lies paid for with purpose to grab attention of weak minded fools"
1,Pure schlock....,"After an hour of suffering through what could only be described as docu-drama, I had to turn it off in order to save my self-respect. Please don't make the same mistake I did. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
1,hateful,"This ""movie"" is a hateful right wing propaganda. Authors are using their assumptions to ignite fear and hate.Shameful.Boring.NOT WORTH $3.99"
5,Fiction At Its Finest,"I did see this movie. I think it is some of the best fiction I've ever seen. Very well done. However, after reading many reviews, I'm seeking clarification.So...it's not okay to respect and support the President because his father was from Kenya or he really wasn't born here or he just isn't American enough (whatever the reason you choose) but it is okay to respect and support a guy out of India who preaches American ideals to citizens born and raised from generations of Americans? I don't know about y'all but I get a little suspicious of foreigners telling me what's wrong with my country.I'm really just not following the logic here. And yes, again, I did see the movie and I have also read Obama's books. And before you accuse me of extreme Leftism and such, I'm also in the U.S. Military, White and Jesus-lovin' so please just answer me the above."
2,Poorly Done Completely Subjective Puff Piece,"Although there is some production value, I have no idea how this lasted in general theater release. The narrative is subjective at best, but poorly researched/ Some claims were made early on that the narrator and Obama come from the same background and meanders into some self-aggrandizing about glory days in college. Disappointed."
1,"Pure, Unadulterated crap","Saw this at a friends house. Unless you are the type that loves to believe every conspiracy theory blown out of Donald Trump's behind, you will recognize this as a pure piece of partisan make-believe."
5,Excellent movie- the actual truth about the Commie POS,"I saw this in the movie theater with my husband. I knew 99% already as I had bothered to not believe the crap and lies in the MSM vintage media in 2008. The anti- colonialism made all the pieces fall into place. I actually bought this to send to my father. The old fool is still wanting to vote for this Muslim Appeasing , commie bastard. Every fool considering voting for this traitor needs to see this movie. I am so angry at the destruction of our magnificent because losers voted based on a massive con game."
2,It's the end of the world !!!!!,"I'm ashamed to say that i paid money to watch this. I gave it 2 stars because it held my attention for the duration, but no more than 2 because it is hopelessly biased. I wanted a balanced report, but this guy is on a witch hunt. I'm not a big fan of Obama, but the demon from hell that he is made out to be in this is laughable...except not so funny when you realize that people believe it. Let's see a documentary about where the world will be in 2016 if Romney gets elected - world war III is a bit more scary than anti-colonialism."
1,BlaBla,I watch a lot of docs and follow a lot of politics. I regret wasting my time. If you haven't heard the basics especially in a form that you can believe them go ahead otherwise fast forward .
2,Nothing to rate here,Disappointed in this as there is just bad and scary things about this man. There is enough of struggles that we mightbe facing in the future without blowing it out of proportion.
3,Time will tell!!!,"I didn't get a chance to view it, but I will 4 years from now and see if I should have and 47% of the rest of the public should have."
1,No real point to this,There was no real point to this documentary and I was not conviced of the anticolonialism message of Mr. D'Souza. I feel I wasted a few bucks to watch it and more importantly an hour and a half of my life I will not get back.
5,Good representation of book.,I really liked this movie. I saw it first in the theatre and wanted a copy in my library. I really fear that D'Souza is correct in his analysis of Obama and his legacy in the US.
1,I wish there was a 0 star option.,"Ridiculous! A friend told me I should watch this. It's like a long political ad- Fear mongering at its best. If I am to believe the message in this documentary, I am also to believe that Bush orchestrated the events of 9/11! I get it- people don't like Obama, I didn't vote for him, but this documentary is pure propaganda. By the end of it- I couldn't even stand the sound of his voice."
2,OBAMAA'S AMERICA,"I JUST PLAIN DIDN'T LIKE IT, COULDN'T FOLLOW THE STORY AND EVEN GAVE IT TO MY BROTHER AND HE FELT THE SAME WAY"
5,Great,Loved it. 18 more words required. 14 more words required 10 more words required 6 more words required 2 more words required
5,This should be shown in every high school!,"This video is a must watch for anyone who wants to maintain our Country, as being free. The President is evil for our Country, and obviously put his Presidential Library in Iran!!"
5,2016 Interesting,"I thought the movie would be all about Obama bashing.The producer's view on ""who is Obama and what is his dream?"" was well done and informative."
4,So true,It's sad this country is so stupid to elect him after all he has done and what he will do next is scary
5,The facts will set you free,"Some people have a hard time with facts. Not me. Great documentary, especially using Obama's own voice to divulge facts."
5,A Must See Film.. Don't be fooled by the one-star reviews,"This film is incredibly done! The narrator sets about to lay out the facts of Obama's life and upbringing. Who influenced him in the early years? What cultural influences did he have in the formative years? How do you explain some of the things he has done in the last four years that don't seem to make sense? This video will lay out all the facts for you to make your own conclusion. If you have any doubt about who you want to cast your vote for in this election, please see this first. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE ONE STAR REVIEWS. BY THEIR DESCRIPTIONS, IT SEEMS THEY HAVEN'T SEEN IT. NO FACTS AT ALL ABOUT THE FILM."
1,This is a bunch of bias crap!,This guy hates Obama so this is what you will get a bunch of made up stuff of so called facts with a bunch of bias crap! Amazon should have a area to rate products like this a zero stars!!!!!!!
1,racist crap and word twisting,load of malarkey taken out of context by a biased film maker. GOP will do or say anything to get back power and control. Racist crap.
1,Right Wing Propaganda,"Don't waste your money like I did, unless you enjoy watching far-fetched right wing propaganda films. It never ceases to amaze me how seemingly intelligent people can totally discredit themselves by putting this type of garbage out to the masses to try to gain some sort of political sway, it's just sad."
5,Powerful!! Every Voter Should see this Before Casting Their Vote!!,This is one of the most powerful movies that I have ever seen! This movie shines light in the previously dark and murky corners of Barrack Obama's life. Dinesh DeSouza has connected the dots and masterfully painted the canvas of the real Obama -- and it is not a pretty picture. You will See Obama through a different lens -- and question his trustworthiness. Obama's world view is antithetical to the values and character that made the U.S. exceptional. Every voter should view this movie before casting his or her ballot -- Is this the America that you want?
1,Demonstrates why the American right wing is in decline,"That someone like Dinesh D'Souza could be called a conservative ""intellectual"" and can then put this utter trash together as if it was legitimate demonstrates the entire problem with the Right Wing in this country. Creating fantasies such as this; essentially applying Freudian psychoanalysis without ever properly interviewing a man; playing on people's worst instincts and fears about minorities--if the Republicans ever thought that this nonsense could help them win the election they do not understand the country. America is not nearly as uninformed, ignorant, and afraid as the producers and Mr. D'Souza would have us believe. How depressing for our country that they believe it themselves--or at least hope for it."
5,2016,"This president was not vetted by the mainstream media, this information should have been given to the general public befor the 2008 election. Would recommend this movie to everyone"
4,"People only believe what they want to, of course.....","People will only believe what they want to believe, regardless of what they are told, shown or can be proven within reality. Unfortunately, the fact that 2016 was written and produced by a very articulate author is not ""proof"", just conjecture, a conspiracy like all only non-complimentary comments/articles/books about President Obama. (RIGHT?) My wife and I have been watching political activities and voting for 46 years. Neither my wife nor I have EVER been more concerned about nor more frightened for our Country and our FREEDOM. Say what you will to deride 2016, De Sousa or me (or anyone else speaking about Obama), if Obama completes an 8 year term as President, it will no longer be humorous nor conpiratorial, just real. The best way to find out WHAT America will NO LONGER BE in 4 MORE YEARS, is to vote for Obama. You can then be right or possibly Wrong. At least you will not be able to blame someone else for what you will not like nor believe."
4,Job well done,"The way that Mr. D'Souza organized his material & presented it was great & very concise. My husband & I had seen this movie at the theater when it came to town. As we watched it then all I could think of is how the American people are being so deceived & munipulated by the man (Obama) & his political ""machine"". Mr. D'Souza did not accuse him of anything, but presented the facts as they are. You can tell that he spent many, many hours (? years) in research & putting this whole thing together. I wanted to get the DVD so that I could sit again & watch it in the comfort of my home. I know that I always miss details in movies like this one the first time around. There is so much information in the DVD that you have to watch it more than once. It is very well done & I recommend it to everyone, no matter what your political preference."
4,America is a grand country and only the ignorant will think otherwise.,America has not taken over any countries that I know of in my life.In this movie you will be able to see if what Souza says is true or not true about what we now know and understand about Obama and our country. Only those that are ignorant and unlearned and unschooled will ever think this movie is somehow geared to keep Obama out of his second term. The fact of the matter is we look pretty silly for bowing at Obama's alter.Educate yourself and save America from the future the radicals want for it. Don't take my little thoughts as your only information. Watch the film. It will make sense if you have ears to hear.
2,Strictly a Piece of Propaganda,"The film is a slick thinly veiled piece of ""neo-Birther"" propaganda. D'Souza would have the viewer believe that President Obama is an anti-colonial ideologue who is mired in the world view purportedly espoused by his father.D'Souza uses ""iffy history"", innuendo and clearly manipulates many of his interviewees by asking leading questions designed to illicit answers that fulfill his own ends. The D'Souza method is a throw back to the Big Lie Theory of the mid-20th century and should be viewed as such. The film fails to rise to the level of history and lacks even a minimum of journalistic integrity.Simply stated this documentary represents the worst kind of scholarship and reportage. Given the outcome of our recent election, the film happily fails. D'Souza's work is an insult to the intelligence of a majority of Americans and should be relegated to the ash heap of revisionist history."
3,"Engaging, but Deceptive","After hearing so much about this movie, I watched it with high expectations of a well-researched, properly informative film. What I got was a bunch of excitement and hypothesis.For me, the most telling statement was one made at the beginning of the movie: Obama returned the bust of Winston Churchill as soon as he got into office. If that is true, there is definitely a claim to be made about Obama's anti-colonial attitude. So, did he really return it? No. No he did not. There were currently two of them at the White House, one on loan to the Bush administration from the British Embassy. The second was returned.Read more about it here: [...]This clear misrepresentation of an event leads me to believe the entire film is a sham. However, it was compelling and well put together, so three stars it gets."
3,Its ok.,Ya you probly get the picture. It is one of those films that was sorta interesting but didn't really give me enough info to really make it worth my while.
5,Too bad more people did not watch it before election,Great insight into the background and motivation of Obama. Too bad more people did not watch it before the election.
5,2016 Obama's America,"Great, gave out to students at the college where I work; they were going to show it but got ""bested"" by storm Sandy. I also gave it to those who had not seen it to inform them of President Obama's intentions for his next term. Wonderful DVD. Guess it didn't work!"
4,Gary Johnson 2016,i cant belive anyone voted for this guy.He did absolutly nothing for Illinois.atleast all the white women can feel a lil bit less racist!
5,Outstanding!,"Very, very well done. No matter who you voted for, no matter who you plan to vote for, you owe it to yourself, you owe it to America, to watch this movie."
5,great movie,"Obama is too dangerous for america, this is a highly recomended movie to all american specially those who support obama ... WAKE UP AMERICA"
5,This is a definite must see!,This is an extremely well documented movie. I wish it wasn't so I could say that everything in the movie was made up or distorted and continue naively believing Obama cares about America. Unfortunately it is impossible to ignore all the facts and research layed out in this film. I strongly encourage all to see this and draw their own conclusions.
4,informative,"I wished he had gotten deeper into other aspects of his actions and past.Would love a follow up with the other supporters and ""his"" government people."
3,Preaching to the Choir,Interesting and revealing but I don't believe the obamites that are stuck in the same rut as obama got anything from it and those that disagree and despise his antics and socialistic policies are essentially powerless to change any of this...this country is in deep trouble. I don't think it hit the mark which I presume to be a blazing expose' of obama and his likely agenda for next 4 yrs. I wouldn't waste the $ on a theater ticket.
3,"Critical, well-produced story on Obama with limited positives.",This is a critical look at Obama and certainly seems timed to help the Republicans in the election for 2012 election in Nov. Lot of details that seem well researched. Many things in this video are not shown anywhere else since the author brought findings from his own research.Audio of people talking in some of the scenes is very hard to understand.Presentation on the positives of Obama is very limited.
4,2016 Obama's America,"The movie was very insightful. If you've asked the question ""why'd he do that"" i.e. not install the oil pipe line from Canada, it gives a pretty good reason. Also shares really good background information. Unfortunately now we'll all get to see Obama's 2016 America."
5,Great information,Everyone should have watched this before election. Very informative and useful movie.Well presented information and worth it to all
3,A little over the top.,"I am not an Obama fan, and I do think that some of his actions in his 1st term need some explanation, but I don't think he's Satan's own spawn. The anti-imperialism idea actually makes a lot of sense given his actions. The extreme right has to turn everything into a conspiracy theory, which is ridiculous. This movie was partly ""more of the same"" right-wing extremism, and partly truth."
3,Supplemental Documentary,"D'Souza put in much time and effort in sharing the background of this President--to include interviews of persons from Kenya, his half brother, and others who don't remember him as a student at certain colleges. From my perspective, it is insufficient, if one is looking to find answers about the life of this President. The documentary, along with others, is a supplement of investigations that may continue for generations."
3,???????,"I haven't watch yet, waiting for 4 years and then I will watch and see for myself if this movie is political hipe and spin or, well let say I hope its wrong!"
3,As the title indicates.,You can choose to Love him or hate him.It is what I expected it to be.Disc plays great.
2,Junk,The DVD didn't make a whole lot of sense that I could tell..... A waste of money and time in my opinion.
3,Just boring,"I had read rave reviews about this movie and eagerly waited for it's arrival. I a nutshell, it is not earthshaking, provided very little new information and frankly, I found it boring."
5,Obama's America DVD,I chose the rating because this is all true and a good factual DVD for everyone to watch. I am very glad to have this DVD in my collection so that I can share with others. This DVD speaks the truth! I highly recommend it for all!
4,March toward Socialism,Not enough folks are really aware of Obama's goals; socialism has never worked and never will.Most of modern Europe is a stark testimony to that fact.
4,Prerequisite to voting,"Many voters, even after the election, revealed how uninformed they were about the man they were voting for. This should have been a prerequisite for voting."
2,Right Wing Projection,"The right wing has thrown everything including the kitchen sink at our president and in the end they have self destructed. Ha! Keep watching movies like this ,Fox news, fat piggy Limbaugh and keep wallowing in your incestual stew. Don't take in any facts that don't support your position ala piggy Rove.. Keep doing that and we moderates and lefties will just take pleasure in your destruction. Or you can join us in the 21st century."
4,Not enough people saw it!!!,I knew most of what was in there! however it was put in perspective when seen all together! I feel that the main stream media didn't or wouldn't advertise this.So that is why I feel not enough saw it! If they did he would not have been re-elected and should not have!!!! Wake up America!! He is down grating our military and life style!!
4,This brings to light Mr. Obama's formative years.,"You may have been raised on Forth of July (Independence Day) and I cream, in other words everything American.Mr. Obama's childhood did not involve much of what we take for granted. Step into his world, and look at America through his eyes, the way he was taught, the way he thinks of America. Understanding him is here in DVD form andtakes only a short period of time. After viewing the DVD you will have a clearer understanding of the fundemental changes he is taking the United States toward."
2,Short On Revelations,"For the most part (for me), the first hour and fifteen minutes of this film has been covered over and over in several other productions and was nothing new. The last fifteen minutes, however, started toward what I feel could've (maybe should've) been the impetus of the film's excellent production quality. I cannot recall ever seeing an interview with the former comptroller general in this film and I think there could be a big story there. Potential for lots of information and revelations.The direction Our country is pointed toward is indeed scary, however, I feel a lot of shine is being put on the fundamental issue of currency collapse and all of the other topics covered in this program pale in comparison."
5,Good documentary.,"If all this information can be verified, it explains much of the thought processes and actions of our POTUS. Not boring."
5,supurb!,Every American should watch this no matter their political views... just consider the possibilities. I felt the background info on the family was especially informative. All our stories start somewhere.
5,Not a movie to love!,"This movie is so very informative, even after this last election. It helps to understand just how he is being so maniplative in reducing our country to a third world country - all because of how his father perceived the world of his time. Twisted and dangerous!!"
1,I THINK THE MESSAGE IS: HATE HIM,"A foreign born, naturalized citizen sticking it to an American born citizen over his foreign ideology, ha! Nothing against naturalized citizens but, you just have to appreciate the situation.Here you have a president with a record of governance right before you and still, you can sell a conspiratorial fantasy of contradiction to the facts. This man, DeSouza, is simply cashing in on the jubilant rush to moron-ification of a large portion of the nation. By this very act, he is the epitomy of American conservatism - any form of personal gain obtained through the denigration of another, usually by creating an outrageous sense of fear around them. He may be guilty of profiting from a sham but, he couldn't have done without the willing ignorance of so many, congratulations."
1,Complete Garbage,A partisan and biased film. It plays to fears that the election of Obama means the downfall of the US. This film is an amalgamation of conspiracy theories and fear mongering. The high production values are used to hide the lack of substance. It is intellectually dishonest and makes no effort to check its own bias.
1,Anti Obama Propaganda,"Our daughter recommended we watch this film before the election. My husband and I rented it and recognized almost immediately that it was an anti-Obama tirade, not a legitimate piece of journalism or an objective documentary. The commentary and interviews were so biased as to be unbelievable. We voted for Romney, but this film was so distasteful, it could have swayed us to vote for Obama. We may not agree with all of President Obama's decisions, but he is not who this film portrays! A waste of time and money."
5,Thought provoking.,This documentary reveals much of Obama's life that has been ignored by the mainstream media....Every other modern President has been subjected to a microscopic examination of their total life...but not Obama.
5,Obama :-(,"I never voted for Obama, and after seeing this video, never would! What a disease my fellow Americans have reelected to office!"
5,Good Book,"I normally do not read these types of books, but I found this one very interesting. I makes sense out of a subject that I do not understand."
2,Bias,I don/t know why I expected this to be without bias. It was a waste of money. Cannot recommend.this DVD.
4,Good,"Definately good but diffferent than what I expected. Had a couple friends over to watch it and they thought the same. President Obama's background and family history were well covered, and certainly brought to life some interesting family members that most people would not have known about."
5,2016 Love him Hate him You don't know him,"The whole world should have seen this excellent, excellent movie. No one would have anything to do with Obama if they had the knowledge that this film depicts. It baffles me how people are so blind as to not see the truth behind him. How could anyone have voted for him? This film is brillant, well-done, and depicted the truth behind this evil man. You think the last four years were difficult, just wait for the next four years. Because of Obama's beliefs as this movie showed, the USA will never get ourselves out of our economic difficulty. We are inches away from falling apart just as the European Union is dissolving. This movie is a definite must see."
5,Interesting,"I found nothing in it as far as facts about Obama's life that I would consider ""fabricated"". Dinesh D'Souza's opinions about Obama are his own and he is entitled to them although he and I share many similar opinions, thus the 5 star rating. I didn't find anything about the ""film"" that I didn't like. I would recommend 2016 to anyone with an open mind. If you hate conservatives, there is nothing to be gained by watching it, your mind is already made up. If you are a conservative, it's more like preaching to the choir but you may find out some facts that you were unaware of."
1,not true,totally distorts the truth. Obama was raised by his American Mother and grandparents.Africa had almost no influence on him.
1,Stupid,obama is in it and i was not responsible for ordering anything that involves him i dont care about him o
4,It spoke the truth,"Everything in this work was vetted. Did he embellish on one thing more than another. Of course he did. But in the end it didn't matter. Will people look in four years and say Oops we made a mistake. Well some will, and some it just does not matter. And sadly I'm starting to think since people couldn't get off their sorry lazy butt and at least vote, well then I guess they got what they ask for. And if Obama was your guy you are happy. We all have an opinion and that is just one of the great things in America. We are allowed to have our own opinion."
5,Liberals wont like it,"Republicans will love it, Democrates will hate it. The theme of the book, the movie, the ""story"" is we do not know Obama. The actions he has taken and words he has spoken tell the story. Everyone takes liberty on telling a story. The facts will always remain facts and our opinions will change. Todays Liberals' love of this man blinds them and therfor they squint at the truth and attack the messingers. In the future we will remember the worst president and the title will be held by ""President"" Obama. We will all discuss and cuss this president while standing in a government line for our share of the wealth. Then we will damn our government and the ignorance of this generation. We can change...vote for a man who believes the way this country was founded, our Constitution is our platform and Free Enterprise is the American way. Today the choice is a Republican candidate."
5,About time someone told the ntreueth about Obama and his administration,I am glad someone finally took the time to take a hard honest look at Obama and his policies he is the first truly unamerican president we have ever had in office and I hope that enough people realise that before he has the chance to bring this country and everyone else he touches to total ruin. The american people need to realise that we have to start actually looking at the people we elect for president before we allow another smooth talking socialist into puplic office which allows them the oportunity to destroy the future of our children from within.
1,nothing but GOP propaganda,"If you love Faux News, then you will likely love this.This film does not let facts get in the way of the message it wants to convey.It is poorly done and is nothing but a republican hatchet job.Avoid if you value your brain."
1,Extreme Right-Wing Fringe Propaganda,"This film is a complete fanatical right-wing paranoid delusion from the mind of Dinesh D'souza, who has been widely denounced by any and all reputable news sources for his fascist, non-fact based views. He believes that President Obama, who met his Kenyan born father only once when he was 10 years old, is now under the spell of what he calls ""...a post-colonial mindset."" This film is a racist propaganda film on par with the vile lies of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. DO NOT WATCH THIS ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA."
1,I don't believe it!,"After reading a few of these reviews, I thought , who is Dinesh D Souza?So unlike the rest of these reviewers, I actually researched it, rather than climbing on board the loony tune express, claiming this drivel to be absolute truth.It is simply breathtaking that people will believe and espouse something they have no real way of knowing. "" I believe because he/she/it says it's so!"" This in place of critical thinking. What an astonishing shame!For heavens sake man/woman, use your brains and think!Just input his name and Google will tell you all you need to know. Look for legitimate web sites, among those that will support this craziness.Who is Dinesh D' Sousa? A conservative, right wing, pseudo journalist, whose beliefs are grist for legitimate journalists, who find his writings a source of continued amusement. In other words, he is a nut. A fanatical one at that!Putting politics aside, am I the only one capable of rational thought?This is only one of many.. [...]"
1,D'Sousa knows Obama? The man has never met or spoke with Obama.,"To say that he hates Obama is an understatement. I honestly believe that this isn't about the decisions that he made but that they just never liked the fact that he won office and didn't support him in no way since he began. If you want the country to go in a right direction, cooperation from both sides is needed. All this pettiness needs to go and is not needed. Work with someone, not just say forget it and fight him. Fighting him won't work. You have to work with what you have."
1,I would suggest 'Barack Obama : Made in Hawaii'.,"If you are sincerely interested in Barack Obama's history you would do well to watch a factually accurate documentary on the subject and I would suggest [...]. Gloria Borland, past Hawaii resident, has made an excellent film on Obama's childhood in Hawaii interviewing 47 people including Barack's friends, teachers and family members. Obama did not grow up in Kansas as Dinesh states he was raised in Hawaii by his white, Christian grandparents. As far as 'Obama / 2016' this sensationalized Obama attack piece trots out every negative trope short of birtherism. It will confirm for Republicans that Obama is an evil anti-American intent on undoing American from the bastion of American power. Democrats will confirm that Dinesh D'Souza is a right wing, conservative, conspiracy wacko. As a documentary film maker, myself, I will say that Dinesh has succeeded in fabricating a right wing propaganda film. Think 'Reefer Madness'."
1,Disgusting!!!,"I can't believe you sell this type of ""documentary""...it is hideous, totally biased and revolting. I was very disappointed. I would like to give it 0 stars."
1,Did not see it.,I didn't see it. I wsnted the dvd not the download. Your site did not allow me to cancel after I realized what I was getting which frustrated me.
2,Not Impressed,Very one sided. Had couple of valid points and about 10000 unfounded accusations. I'm niter a democrat or a republican... Waste of money.
1,Garbage,Political propaganda from a jealous conspiracy nut. Instead of condeming Obama it clarifies why we need more leaders like Obama!
2,2016 Obama's America,"It scares me. Not being an Obama fan, I would never purchase it again. It is just not for me."
1,Poor Quality DVD,"I had already read the book but missed the movie in the theater so decided to buy the DVD when it came out. The audio quality on the DVD is so bad we could not follow it. The ""background music"" is anything but background, it was so loud we could not hear the narrative. Turned it off after about 20 minutes. My advice is to buy the book and forget about the DVD."
2,Really?,"So after reading the reviews, and looking at the ratings given, and content of review, I deduce thus;100% of those giving 5 stars think its only the other 47% giving it 1 star ;Pjust forums spouting/cliche rhetoric from fanboys.Not watching this, propoganda is propoganda, yawn.GET YOUR GOVERNMENT OFF MY SOCIAL SECURITY! trolol"
1,Worst Movie Ever,Worst piece of clap trap ever! Blatent proporganda! Was a waste of money and time. Written for exteme right wingers for right wingers. Full of lies and exaggerations. How do they get away with this crap?
1,Partisan hackery,"Some other greatest hits by D'Souza:In early 2007, D'Souza published ""The Enemy at Home: The Cultural Left and its Responsibility for 9/11"". The book was criticized in major American newspapers and magazines and called, among other things, ""the worst nonfiction book about terrorism published by a major house since 9/11"" and ""a national disgrace.""In September 2010 he published ""The Roots of Obama's Rage"".His own conservatives criticize him:Daniel Larison of The American Conservative: ""Dinesh D'Souza has authored what may possibly be the most ridiculous piece of Obama analysis yet written. ... All in all, D'Souza's article reads like a bad conspiracy theory.""This is a work in that long conservative tradition of creating a self-reinforcing alternate reality that only they see.So if you're a conservative, take a break from Fox News and Glenn Beck and watch this and then feel the camaraderie amongst yourselves about how much you hate Obama."
1,Absolute Garbage,"Nothing but paranoid conspiracy theories from a teabagger. Don't waste your time, this thing is awful. Absolutely the most ridiculous film I have ever seen."
2,propaganda disguised as a documentary,"faux documentary pushing an individual's agenda for a self serving purpose. prominently groundless and wildly presumptuous. clearly an attempt to scare and persuade undecided voters who choose not to think for themselves or perform their own due diligence, but rather be swayed by a dramatic musical score and some out of context sound bites."
3,Get me some Pepto Bismol,"When I usually write a review, I try to keep it to somewhere around four to five paragraphs, just enough to make a recommendation - or give a pass - but not so much that someone will have to read a ""manifesto."" Today, because of the political nature of the movie, I will keep it very brief.If you are liberal, you will not like this movie because you won't agree with it. If you are conservative, you will not like this movie because it will make you ill.After watching, get me some Pepto Bismol. Hopefully, I won't need it for the next four years."
1,All I can say is ....,"It's a good thing that we have such a clearly defined alternative in Mitt Romney. There is guy we can be sure of. Obama hates America. Let's put Mitt in there. Why, just look at his record as governor! That guy, he calls them like he sees them. There is a straight arrow for you. What I love about Mitt is how clearly he defines his vision for America: big change, big ideas, smaller government with a bigger army. It's like a road map to the American Dream. When I think of all the great men who have lead this nation, and all of the troubled times we have struggled through, clearly: Mitt Romney is the great man we've been waiting for."
1,"Extreme, Crazy, Unrealistic",Don't waste your time or money on this movie. Full of crazy and extreme plots that are not fact based.
1,Fail,Typical right wing fear mongering. D'Souza provides no evidence but some creative editing =. Not worth your time or money.
1,Fearmongering,"Very disappointed and not worth the money to see it. It was one sided and clearly biased. I found 2016 is not much different than Palin's Undefeated, pure right wing fallacy."
1,Sigh,You might as well watch Fox News. This is the same garbage they shovel there. Nothing factual about any of it.
5,WONDERFUL GREAT JOB DINESH D'SOUZA,WHAT AN INCREDIBLE AUTHOR EVERYONE IN AMERICA SHOULD SEE THIS FILM AND DINESH D'SOUZA DESERVES AN AWARD. SHAME ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THIS IS NO LONGER AMERICA. SO SAD FOR OUR CHILDREN.
5,Truth,"Every American needs to watch this movie! Eye opener! After watching, vote him out! I'm telling all my friends to watch this amazing truth telling movie!"
1,NOT a documentary - illogical fallacy methodolgy,"I'm surprised that this is categorized in documentaries. Throughout the film, obvious illogical fallacies are employed to support the propositions of the filmmaker. Not a scholarly piece of work. Facts are intermingled with suppositions and then resolved as fact. Fallacies: slippery slope, association, baby and the bath water, etc. Film was disappointing."
4,Obama's America,This dvd gave a lot of information as to the back ground of our president and his growing up years. Gave a lot of insight to the way he thinks and or believes.
2,Big hoopla about nothing,"I was hoping to watch something deeply insightful and actual/factual documentary. However, Mr. D'souza did not present any hard hitting facts but just plain theories without much basis. Lot of the statements seem to be derivations made by the author taking a lot of artistic license."
4,If you love him - don't watch this.,"Seemed factual and utterly believable.The government says our real income has decreased 10 percent since Obama has been in office. If you want to see this country turn around don't vote for him.Otherwise - buy solid assets - gold - silver, etc because our dollars won't be worth much at the end of another 4 years of Obama."
5,Everyone needs to see this,This is pure facts and it is scary that we have put this mad man in power. I highly recommend people watch this and make their own decision about him.
4,Great research,"Dinesh D'Souza did some great research into the man we know very little about and presented it in logical fashion. Not very exciting for sure, but very enlightening."
5,Game Changer.,"This film is an engaging, informative and deeply concerning film for anyone who is truly curious about who influenced Barack Obama and why he is so hell bent on enforcing the radical ideals he was indoctrinated with. I personally recommend not only viewing this film, but also purchasing a DVD copy so you may lend it to friends and family as well."
2,2016 obamas america,"not at all what i expected,of course most of these type of movies are not made for entertainment,one has to queston the truth of part of it"
1,Waste of time,What a biased piece of fiction. We can only assume that the director has the same thoughts and feelings as he assumes Obama does since they have some in common. Give me a break! Obviously trying to capitalize on his conspiracy theories.
1,Complete Nonsense,"Complete nonsense. Right wing propaganda. D'Souza is no forgeigner, but from Bombay, NEW YORK! He's a fake. This whole rediculous movie is twisted trash. Don't waste your money or your time."
1,Just the usual Right Wing Crap,"Really? There are actually people who believe what this movie claims. If you are a fascist right winger, you will really enjoy this movie. I wouldn't even call it subtle. (Although I guess it is subtle and restrained for what most of the right-wing says about Obama.This creed starts with the usual whining about how the ""mainstream"" media just can't report the truth. Right. If you like Fox, you'll love this movie."
1,"Right-handed Michael Moore, but less fun","I went to see this movie for the same reason I earlier went to see Fahrenheit 911: to see what all the fuss was about. I still don't know. If this movie is actually about anything, it is his mother's lousy taste in men. She's the one who actually raised the man and she is almost never mentioned. I guess I should admire the subtlety of the subliminal message of racial xenophobia but I can't even bring myself to sarcasm. The reason we have stupid politicians is because we have a stupid electorate."
3,Need to see.,"It was fine, but I already knew much of what it was saying. It is however something that we need to be aware of."
2,2016 Obama's America,The tape was very boring and hard to keep watching without yawning. Wouldn't recommend to anyone at any time. UGH
5,"Fair and Accurate, Mainly Obama's Own Words","Watch this for your ""ah-ha"", eureka moment...the pieces fall together and finally the last four years make more sense. We on team America want a coach who has our back and wants to win the Super Bowl, but we've seen him throw games, bow to the opposition, and weaken our chances for the championship and we've scratched our heads (and also banged them against a wall sometimes!) wondering what was going on. See 2016:Obama's America and you will better understand the danger we face with 4 more years of this President!"
2,2016 Obama's America,I didn't see too much of Obama in this movie to who the movie thought he was and who he actually is. Obama's America was not told but it's coming and none of us will like it.
2,dont believe all you see,"i believe the writer of this documentary has a personal venndeta with obama. i also believe he is seeking much notariety from this film, contraversy just for recognition."
4,Scary but insightful!!!,This is a very good video of how we can be so blinded by our emotions in something as important as our nation's fate in leadership. The video gives you a very good understanding of our president's background and how he sees our country & where it should be directed toward. Let me also add that this is NOT an Obama bashing documentary so please be open to the material that will be presented.
3,Important info to know.,It was informative but not as much as I was hoping for. I probably will share this movie with others.
1,Nothing new,Standard propaganda film that was designed to be released during the republican convention this year. Dinesh D'Souza has been spewing propaganda for the right ever since he immigrated from India. It doesn't really change anything in the big picture. The right wing look at a film like this as gospel while the left ignore it. The undecideds don't look to a propaganda film for valuable information. Films like these are common on both sides of the aisle.
1,2016 Obama,"Sadly this movie was disappointing. The writer is Michael Moore want to be without any bite, substance or believable argument for his story. Don't waste your time."
1,Utter hate from a known hater,"The film is nothing more than a NOT skillfully edited patchwork of fellow haters, quotes taken out of context, or re-edited to look like Obama is saying something else. D'Souza was a total scandal in his dealings with Dartmouth College and he continues to be nothing more than a bald-faced, well financed hater. He is living proof that under the GOP as he sees it, we will have the very best government that money can buy. Caveat emptor!"
1,Duh,"Huh. I thought neocon ideologues didn't make documentaries. I stand corrected. Congratulations, folks! Here's the thoughtful non-fiction film you've been looking for to counter the billion others out there that you refuse to watch. If you are among the rest of the world that appreciates journalism and critical thinking, this is probably not for you.Sarcasm aside, This film is so up its butt. The only thing serious about it is how many suckers take it seriously. That's some scary business."
1,Don't bother,"Watched it because I was curious. This is just a biography of Obama and what he's done this far. This doesn't really give anyone reason to 'fear' or 'distrust' him as the conservatives want. Overall, just a waste of money."
2,"Movie is good, if you can watch it","The movie was good , but i could barely watch it because it hung up so muchAnd this has never happened with netflix or hulu"
4,"Eh, not bad . . .","What I found most interesting about this movie is that it's not really a ""we hate him"" or ""we love him"" as much as it is a ""this is who we think he is and why he does what he does"".Unlike most political movies, this is more of an explanation than praise or detraction. It was an eye-opener for the people around me who saw it. I think Americans too often try and force people into molds that we find easiest to deal with. This movie sort of removes the subject from the mold many have tried to force him into and allows the viewer to redefine their understanding of Obama."
5,A must see for everyone before the elections.....,"I saw the movie in the theater a couple of month ago, and hope people see it before the elections, and realize who the real Obama is, and what are his real plans for the next 4 years, if he is reelected.... it's not up to him....it's up to us.....THE FUTURE is in OUR HANDS........(that's how it ends)"
1,D'Souza Hates America,"6 days after our country was attacked by terrorists on 9/11, this darling of the political right went on national television to praise the terrorists who destroyed the World Trade Center, ""Look at what they did. First of all, you have a whole bunch of guys who are willing to give their life. None of 'em backed out. All of them slammed themselves into pieces of concrete. These are warriors. And we have to realize that the principles of our way of life are in conflict with people in the world"" ([...]). Anyone who is eating the schlock he's serving up as fact needs to find a better source of information. Dinesh D'Souza is an anti-American blow-hard who deserves to ignored."
1,Chasing Ghosts,"D'Souza relies upon his cancerous mode of ""reasoning"" here to come up with his ""Obama is out to punish imperial America"" nonsense. Perhaps this kind of thinking is what caused him to announce his paramour as his fiance just a short time after he was separated from his wife (and thus still very married)."
2,who got him elected,he is clearly a muslim and hater of white people. not how he got voted in but who got him voted in. the people behind him are evil and out to destroy america
4,good info ....,"very slow but informative . few surprises , for the intelligent , truly open minded thinkers . definitely carries the reasoning WHY Obamster NVER should have been elected once , let alone TWICE ."
2,2016 Obama's America,It was a very slanted point of view. I could not find it all believable.I do not refcommend it.
5,Must watch,Gave insight to our President. Very thought provoking and somewhat scary. Where he is leading us is not what you think.
4,Required viewing before you Vote.,Excellent documentory of Obama's life. To bad not enough people saw it.Only thing missing was a little more history about Obama's mothers relationship with Frank marshall Davis. Obama's real father. And the other misfits surrounding Obama.The proof at [...] . Dreams from Obama's Real Father a must see.
4,2016 obama's America,Scary but great - nicely organized and put togetherAmericans should all do their due diligence before voting. Dinesh uncovers facts not opinions about our President which are terrifying and imply much worse is yet to come in the next 4years.
4,2016 Obama's America!,"Factual, scary, imposing warnings for what is ahead for America! Worth the time to view and consider. It will be interesting to see how D'Souza's words play out in the future!"
5,obama 2016,A must watch for any Idiot (Democrat) that voted for this clown. God help us all in four years...A must watch for any Idiot (Democrat) that voted for this clown. God help us all in four years...
1,Was not what we expected as a movie.,Thought it would be more of a movie but it was a documentary and not what I had expected. Actually fell asleep during it!
3,Obama Uncovered?,What the film says can be found in his two books. The film adds nothing to what we already know.
2,Oboma's America 2016,I thought it would be a documentary about his life but it was all negative stuff. I just wasn't into it.
2,Dont waste your money,"Allthough there is some interesting information to think about, it is quite ling and drawn out. It only confirms what i allready know that Obama is a socialist, a liar and an egomanic."
1,Didn't get to see it.,"I was enticed by the trailers for this title. However, my order did not process ans I did not see it."
3,Hard to follow,"Hard to follow the story, narrator was jumping around talking about one subject then another, then back to his original point. Guess we'll see what happens in 2016."
2,Not informative,Not what I expected I expected more facts on his life Like his schooling his work record It was to general
5,Unbiased and Informative look into Obama's past,"Saw this movie twice. There are no lies in this film, despite what the Liberal Media loves to say. Everything in the film is based on facts and evidence, as I'm sure D'Souza knew the film would be highly scrutinized and fact-checked."
5,Worth Watching!,"In my opinion every voter should watch this movie. We should be informed about a worse case scenario of 4 more years of what we have experienced. Personally I have experienced higher gas prices, more business regulations, more overseas competition, less religious freedoms, etc.Dinesh D'Souza offers a different perspective on why President Obama does things the way he does. There are times he acts in ways we aren't used to coming from our President. One is demonizing successful people and job creators/private sector, another is returning the bust of Churchil to England. Watch the movie to find out."
1,Ridiculous,This is a ridiculous move made by republicans to bash the President. People can make a movie that shows their point of view and make it seem like fact whenever they want. Don't buy into this garbage.
1,Anti-Colonialism,"Being anti-colonialism is common sense based on the facts of our world. Some people need to get out and smell the roses; go check out the disasters of imperialism. First Nation people should know this better than anyone. D'Souza's premise for this film is false, therefore the film is slanted propaganda--bleh! And, I HAVE SEEN THE FILM!"
1,The 1% must be getting nervous,"Just another piece of media displaying how the 1% keep their ""power"" -- by feeding us with deceitful fear. We are bombarded by bad news, unhappiness and fearful stories like this because this is how they keep control of our 'puppet strings'. Someone like Obama might just show the people that they have power, too. That they can run their own lives. These are scary ideas for those who try to control every second of our lives. (eg: Do you speak up about your work conditions or benefits? Or are you to scared you'll lose your job?)"
1,God bless the ignorant,"You know, it would be easy to create a film about any person in a negative way.Even a ""savior"" like Ronald Reagan would not be immune if a movie's sole purpose was to inflame the ignorant. If you wish to see this propaganda, rent it, being aware of it's purpose and try not to laugh in public (people who believe such tripe are dangerous to themselves and others). By all means, be certain not to buy it or its delusional conclusions."
5,2016 Obama's America,"This documentary is not controversial, not inflammatory -- just straight talk, straight facts. At the end, I found it very disturbing and worrisome. It's not surprising that the release date was too late to make a more informed decision when voting."
5,WATCH THIS NOW!,"This is an eye opening film and shows the true intentions of BO! It is somewhat ""dry"" in the middle but at the end D'Souza suddenly opens your eyes! Now I understand why BO has been angry and frustrated in the last two debates...he may be sensing that his opportunity to fundamentally Change and Transform America may be in danger. I also understand why he keeps ""good old Joe"" around as veep...he (BO) can't afford to have a strong VP who may interfere with or question his decisions and actions. The same holds for Pelosi and Reid."
4,Obamba fo yo mamba!,"Keep obamba in president you know he gave us a phone he goin do more ! This dudes a sick pup thinks like an ingrate the way his dada did, very deep documentary gets real good last 25 minutes first part kinda slow. You'll be disgusted by the time your done."
1,Garbage,"Only for red-neck Republicans; written by an Indian who wants desperately to be accepted.Beyond being a joke, it was also incredibly boring. If you were going to make up so much garbage, couldn't you have thrown in some cool special effects of aliens attacking from Mars?"
1,It's all fake,"This is a fake movie. It was made to only please the Birthers and Tea Party. Viewers probably also watch that channel they call ""Fox 'News'"""
1,Really Dnesh?,"Not impressed. I swear Dsouza must be the living, breathing personification of Gunga Din or something. Innuendo and supposition in lieu of facts is not helpful."
1,Are you people kidding,It amazes me on the propaganda bull that can influence people on twisted facts. Watch C-Span or the History Channel for the real facts you'll be amazes on who has the horns here. I once watch on the History Channel about the Persian Gulf war and how we screwed that up that cuased us to go back but I bet that was President Obama's fault too. Does it reality matter what faith you are because there are radicals no matter where you look in any faith. All I know is Mitt Romney even states he'll downsize the Federal government and remove where ever there is waste to him. For example the USPS and education is well in his sites. Wakeup people we are all in this together. By the way it's true about flying saucers I read it in the National Enquire and yes Elvis did go back to his planet.
1,You must be kidding.,"Didn't see the movie, just saw the filmmaker interviewed. I guess it is ideal for the tin foil had crowd."
5,Good Documentary,This is an excellent documentary that gives you a glimpse of how Obama came about his way of thinking. I recommend.
5,"The Most Transparant Admininstration, EVER!","I really don't know of a better way to BEGIN to understand the Mystery Man, Barry Soetoro, aka Barack Husain Obama. Even though he was able to refrain from having to answer any meaningful questions and get re-elected, this is a disk that should be shared with as many as possible.Maybe, being FORWARNED will provide an opportunity for individuals to get to cover before the s**t storm starts."
5,the scairiest movie i have ever seen,"i thought enemy of the state was scairy, this tops it. i cannot believe this country voted him in again. god help us all,"
2,I'm no Obama fan .....but even so this was Total Bollocks,Some interesting insights but he dis-credits the movie with overly biased journalism.It's a shame because I believe awareness should be heightened on the detrimental impact of this man & his socialist bias on this great country.Not credible journalism though.
3,Very interesting,"This helped me make my decision during the Elections. I gives a somewhat lopsided view, but interesting commentary about Oboma's book ""Dreams of my Father"". I would like to see if his predictions will come true, now that Oboma has been re-elected. His predictions are kinda scary."
5,Scary,Loved this movie. I think we already were aware of most of the content but putting it all together in one documentary form movie was great to see. I think it captures the truth of the man and it is scary
3,Very informative!,Helped me understand where and how our president got his socialist attitude. It also made me sad for the people he denies as his family.
2,An important film.,"This is an important film, it will be long remembered as will the talented team who wrote, produced and supported it. It will be spoken about and studied along with the works of D W Griffith and the team that wrote and directed ""Refer Madness"". In a decade or so, when the radical right has a new target, and a new crop of clueless conservative minded Randians, this embarrassing piece of reactionary fiction will be studied, and written about and remembered. We need to remember the works of hatred, the creation of fearful reactionaries. It's important."
4,inside obamas head,showed this onone of our movie nights and the movie was weell recieved dispite it being political....this was a very fair treastment of the subject .....recommend it....eb
5,very objective,"""2016 Obama's America"" is a perfect example of what a well thought out, and objective documentary should be like. Given the directors background with in the Reagan administration one might feel as though Dinesh D'Souza is Bias. Of course he's bias and of of course that matters, but his bias leaning toward conservatism is what made an objective vetting of Barack Obama possible. That is what has been missing since 2008 from our media sources concerning our dear ruler. Put this film on the top of your must watch list you will not be disappointed. That is unless you think Obama is a god."
3,Modern Day Hitler,I think there are more important problems with Oboma than the author described. I think he is determined to bring this country down to a third world country in order to get his social agenda fulfiled. After reading this book a unformed person would start to feel sorry for him as how he was raised. He is nothing more than a modern day Adolf Hitler. He will completely destroy this great nation if he gets a chance.
4,Obama's America,This DVD was nothing what I thought it was going to be... It is full of currant information and very eye opening and so far has totally came true.
5,Reality check,Too bad more people didn't see this earlier. It is a real reality check about what is going on. Real eye opener.
3,My review of 2016,The producer did some research. I guess we will find out in the next four years how prophetic this documentary was .
1,CRAP,"First and foremost, I am not an 'Obama-bot,' ...simply a movie critic that loves films.The documentary goes something like this: ""Once upon a time a Nigerian immigrated to Hawaii and had sex with a woman and had a son named Barrack Obama. Then the man left and Barrack grew up loving a man that wasn't there..........(insert psychologist that has never sat down with Obama to make an analysis of ""WHAT CAN GO WRONG WITH A KID THAT DOESN'T KNOW HIS FATHER.""Fast forward a bunch of personal right-wing nonsense and opinions about the film maker's background/life/experiences in America etc...............Then the documentary takes the following kind of turn: ""Barrack's grandma in Africa whom he never met, says that Barrack is a a communist, and is dangerous because of he never took care of a half-brother whom he met once when he was five .....blah blah blah............It's just really silly.""POORLY MADE documentary"" is an understatement."
3,America 2016,I was happy to see but it is a bit scary to see this stuff. Most people don't realize what can happen.
3,Interesting movie,"Interesting and I can see the point. very conservatively done, which I can understand even why. I recommend seeing it."
3,2016 Obama's America...,It shown me what kind of a man we have in office. Not pleased with him at all...but an eye opener...
2,not what i expected,"was so hard to hear the commentator as the music was way to loud! i was expecting better information, something we hadn't already heard"
5,The Worst of the Worst,Obama has been the worst President we have had in the last 100 years. I already hated his presidency before this movie came out but it's nice to see people opening their eyes to the facts.
5,Eye Opener,Once this movie started.....we couldn't stop watching. It is a fascinating review of the origins of our President's present behaviour. It is like a jigsaw puzzle.....as you watch it the pieces fall into place.......and you release why our President acts the way he does....and what he really stands for.VERY SCARY!Every voter should have watched before this recent election.
5,2016,This was a fantastic non judgemental movie that can truly help u understand our current president....would strongley reccommend to anyone who is having problems understanding why he does some of the things he does...classic example of an apple not falling far from the tree
4,Judgement,The main reason I purchased this film came from all the comments from family and friends who saw it. I found it an interesting commentary but was not influencial in making my voting decision.
4,Eerily Prophetic!,"Even after the election, this is a must-see. Why? You will know where this president is trying to take us...into third world country status. Why, you may ask? That's the purpose of the film. It chronicles the up-bringing and training of Mr. Obama in his most formative years, and the resultant ideology...NOT traditional free-market America at all! If this movie had been watched by more, the election would have had a different outcome, regardless of the banding together of a bunch of special interests. If you care about the future of our country, this at least deserves 2 hours of your life. A well-crafted documentary that I unfortunately feel will seem prophetic in a few short years."
3,have not reviewed,have not reviewedhave not reviewedhave not reviewedhave not reviewedhave not reviewedhave not reviewedhave not reviewed so I can't comment
3,moves too slow,"It moved too slow,the editor did'nt have to show the narrators every move on each air plane trip,this movie could/should have effectively edited down to a 1 hour documentary and got the point across a lot faster.my opinion only"
3,2016 dvd,"what I expected, no more or less. The DVD was easy to use and subject was a good presentation by the author."
3,I'm not sure why I bought this,"We have read articles by Dinesh and learned a lot, but this book depressed me terribly. He's a good man."
1,I am NOT an Obama supporter!,"Just so we understand I did not vote for Obama in either term. That being said, this movie literally bored me to sleep. I found that it drug out in ways that were not necessary to tell the story. And in some areas it didn't explain enough. I am not one to watch these types of movies, but with all the hype regarding it, My interest was piqued. Unfortunately I did not come away from this feeling as if I was educated more on this man who is currently in charge of our nation. And there fore I was not able to give this movie more stars."
1,Not what it was cracked up to be,"This video hyped up that it told us who Obama was, wrong. This video is a real waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Draws Weak Conclusions On Contrived Evidence,"D'Souza carves his own path based on thin evidence that Obama has some anti-American agenda based on his father's experience with colonialism. Colonialism, a practice that I believe our own founding fathers revolted from. The production value is good, but lacks any punch or substance. As I heard one previously review, it's a movie for the already convinced."
4,Understand Obama,"This documentary is very thorough in reviewing Obama's upbringing, especially settling on his relationship with his father and mother. His governing is shown to be directly tied to what he learned from these mentors and others."
5,America's decline,"In a time when so many people are ignorant to America's heritage because of the dumbing down of America's children created by the public schools, you can see how people can be wooed into the clap-trap just as the German and Russian people were wooed into the likes of Hitler and Stalin. We are on our way! 51 % of the American people are deceived.Joseph Goebbels, Nazi propaganda minister said after one of his rallies, ""If I had told the people to jump into a lake they would have done so."""
2,This is a loser,A disjointed and ridiculous documentary that distorts the person. and I even voted Republican this year! Would not recommend this to anyone.
5,Watch before Voting,"Compelling documentary that opened my eyes behind the moral philosophies of our president. The first documentary I found that did not spew rhetoric or political bias, just simply stated facts. I am glad to be informed of Obama's past and where his ideologies come from and am appalled by the blatant media protection he receives. In this day in age, it is understandable that dirt from people's past will come to the surface. But, after seeing this film and the secrecy behind this president, he simply is un-American and unelectable."
2,Half-baked,This film pulled far too many punches and revisited already tread ground in exposing Barack Obama. I found myself being grateful that I had not paid a full admission price in the theater.
2,Still don't know him (at least not from this film),"I gave this movie 2 stars because the part about Dinesh D'Souza was somewhat interesting. There was nothing scary, controversal, or even slightly scandelous about Obama. Checked the facts. Obama returned the Churchill bust AND OTHER ART LENT BY BRITAIN to them. Obama reacted to his sister's visit with the truth about his dad? Seemed like the normal response. Obama visited his fathers grave? Wow how wierd is that. Nothing to see here folks."
5,good film,"Raises some interesting questions about Obama's background. Even more interesting if you have read Obama's books. Same material as D'Souza's book, but not quite as much detail."
2,Rubbish,"This is rubbish. Obama is an imperialist like anybody else, he supports the expansion of the American Empire like anyone one else. ""What we want for Syria, what we want for Iran, when we want for Lybia...""It's the same old song, but with a little more compassion for his fellow man.He capitulates to political pressures, he compromises, he increases taxes, he increases the debt, like any good American President.At least he isn't Bush, who never vetoed a spending bill.But he's hardly Bill Clinton, who kept us out of war for eight years and left office with a surplus.Presidents like that don't come along every day."
3,Rehash!,Nothing new for those who cared - didn't make a difference to those who didn't - too bad it wasn't released earlier.
3,2016 obamas America,"The first hour was old news, the balance was great, there is so much more that could have been covered and was not . Acceptable if you have not fallowed the obamas 4 year record as President..."
2,Good but MAJOR flaw.,"I saw 2016 in the theatre, but major flaw is that the Kenyan Obama is NOT the real father. The President's real father is Communist Frank Marshall Davis, who raised him in Hawaii. I recommend the DVD ""Dreams from My Real Father."" It gets to the truth of the matter of how and why we have a Marxist Communist in the White House."
2,Hey can you please do one on Romney?,"Hey can you please do one on Romney? Where the hell is a Romney movie, everyone says they need more information before they vote, but all I see is about Obama and little to none on Romney, like he fought the court to keep the libertarian off the ballot. You don't believe me, look it up, get informed. Even better how about a movie that talks about a two party system that has ran this country since the beginning and Americans can't see that neither one has done nothing for ""Us"" you know as in this movie ""We The People"""
1,Wish I could give it zero stars,More teabagger propaganda crap from another Republican neocon hypocrite who can't keep it in his pants until the divorce comes through. How do you people sleep at night?!?
1,Spoiler alert!!!!,"Obama is a polygamist! Seriously, according to this movie! This is crazy stuff, I'm surprised no one has brought this to anyone's attention."
1,"Scary. Dumb, fact free, with a scary soundtrack, and lots of innuendo.","Completely hyped out of thin air. Scary Obama. You'll sleep with your lights on, if you are stupid enough to think anything of substance is in this movie. I couldn't find anything, and I sleep peacefully. Waste of my time."
2,"Presumptuous, superficial and based on stereotype","I want my time back! I really think this half an hour was a waste of time.It was presumptuous, superficial and it seems really clear to me that before starts his journey the author has already a specific idea about Obama and what he only did is to find information that supports his superficial idea."
1,Dinesh D Souza,"Just Wikipedia on who is making the film: Dinesh D Souza, a conservative political commentator, so of course the views are going to be skewed. Fact check everything before you believe in them."
1,Political fanaticism and independent critical thinking cannot coexist,"This ""film"" takes snips of real interviews and puts them so far out of context that the true meaning and intent of the spoken words is utterly lost. This is long-running political campaign ad that, sadly, talks only about why we should dislike our current president (who has reversed the worsening recession when he took office). Where is the film's integrity to truth? This seems like a tool to seperate people by making them dislike the ""other side"" - it seems to engender fanatical thinking.This great country was founded on clear, critical, independent thinking with a striving for what is right and good for all involved. I see us falling more and more into the habit of political fanaticism - where is the golden tolerance and striving for understanding that makes us such a successful country? Think of the nations/countries out there today that encourage fanaticism; is that how we want to live? I hope not."
1,Tired of all the SHILL reviews of this TRASH,"Right wing lies and slander as told by ""Moral"" Hypocrite D'Souza. The recent scandal in his personal life simply underscores his phoniness. The astonishing number of reviews giving this worthless tripe FIVE stars only goes to prove that no one ever went broke underestimating the ignorance or racism on the American public. Disgusting."
1,Pure FICTION.,"This film is nothing more than political manure slinging and lies. With every election the corporate plutocracy, and their republican puppets, sinks to ever lower depths of deception, propaganda, and dirty tricks. The makers of this film are guilty of malicious slander."
2,Expected More,I expected more out of this program. While I'm not an Obama supporter I feel that this documentary could have been better.
2,False premise,"Maybe this movie appeals to the faux news crowd, but it is not a good documentary. It is a one-sided film with a political motivation. Why is Dinesh not attacking the colonialist nature of Bush? Obama has not attacked countries on his own for territory. Bush did! If there was a desire to create American colonialism it is clearly the Bush dynasty that hates what America stands for, not Obama."
1,scary content but you should see it to see what we're in for!,"More people should have seen this before the 2012 election.....................we're in for a BAD RIDE with this man! Keep in mind, that half of us did NOT want to go on the ride at all.....IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN YESTERDAY!"
1,Lies,"Really just a movie for conspiracy theorists. Lacks supporting facts which allows the movie to make wild claims. Great entertainment though for the ""world is going to end"" crowd."
1,junkme2e,"There is quite a bit of factual information here, and quite a bit of spin. If you are a white American or a non-white American who is not comfortable with people who have a different ethnic or cultural background than you do, you will probably not want to vote for Barack Obama. I think that what this story demonstrates is candidate and President Obama's skill as a politician in negotiating the possible while staying in power. I cannot justifiably presume Obama's ideology from this story as the author does, although I would venture to say Obama is a realist and a centrist, although spun slightly to the left compared to the right.(!) He still has my vote. We are not all on our own. We are all in this together. Overall, I would describe this film as fear mongering tripe, and it does not reflect well on Mr. D'Souza."
1,Horribly Right-Sided Evaluation of President Obama,"At first, this seems as if it might be a well thought out, informative film; however, it is not. Granted, some of the history in the film is true (for instance, Obama's childhood family situation), but the main point of the film is all wrong. The author that spawned this ridiculous documentary assumes a theory of President Obama's motives that simply does not make sense. Though the film will try to convince you that this theory is correct, please think critically. This is an extremely inaccurate, slanderous, pro-conservative film - do not mistake it for an unbiased, objective documentary."
1,propaganda film,"this is clearly a political propaganda film with an agenda wrapped in the inauthentic cloak of a factual unbiased documentary. if you watch this make sure to realize that the editing creates an impression that simply does not match reality. no news organization, no journalistic organization would endorse this as a factual work."
1,uh.....,"i don't know what in the world those things are but uh... they look kinda soulless, i would be afraid to have one of them with me when i fall asleep."
2,This toy is definitely not what it's cracked up to be,"Well, I was curious about ""Giant Microbes"" so I ordered this one, but it may well be the last one I order. I was very disappointed when I stroked it; it wasn't at all soft; the fur was harsh and scratchy and it was a lot smaller than I expected. Overall, I feel this toy is definitely not what it's cracked up to be."
2,NO better than cheaper mocs,I have purchased a pair of these Jungle Mocs. They didn't even last! The cheaper $19. version in a sports stlye last longer. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
3,"They're great! And, they don't last long","I'm now looking for a deal on my third pair of these. They are far more comfortable and better made than the cheaper versions (of which I've tried 3 or 4 kinds on). However, they don't last more than a year and a half before the fabric inside the heal starts to rub away and the rubber over the toe starts to delaminate. And, I'm totally mad at the fact that NOBODY will discount these shoes. $64 is the cheapest you will ever find these shoes (in regular widths)...anywhere."
4,This book is a must have for every 9-12 year old!!,Virtual Grossology is a must have for every 9-12 year old. It fits right in with their sense of humor and gives a little education at the same time. Beware the smelly pages are really smelly and the illustrations and descriptions are not for the weak stomached. Grossness aside it is a fantastic and fun book.
1,Disappointment,"If I had wanted a picture book, done in a comic book format, this would have been fine. It was not what I was looking for - I expected a more intellectual treatment. Will NOT but Geary again."
2,Jack the Ripper (Treasury of Victorian Murder),"I did not like this book as well as some of the other readers. I found some of the pictures hard to see (There were a couple of pictures that I plain could not figure out what they were). Also, the writting is very small, so put on some strong reading glasses.Between the black and white drawings and the very small print, this book is a pain in the *** to read."
2,"ok, but not worth the money","The concept is a hardcover comic book re-telling the same old tired story, no new facts. Ok drawings, but definitely not worth the money."
1,$100?!?,"Absurd pricing. This book retails for $19.99, direct from the *non-profit* organization which publishes it. I HOPE this is just some sort of weird error."
1,disappointment,"I had heard great things about Mr. Stein his writing style; however, when I actually started to read his book, I found it to be a vast disappointment. While this book discusses the idea of compassion, it doesn't actually show it. Additionally, the characters were very flat and I found their reactions to be emotionless and unfounded, and at times, the narrator's detachment is positively irritating. Morevoer, the plot was very slow, an attribute which Mr. Stein's plodding and self-involved writing style did not alleviate. If it were not for the previously good reviews that gave me the inkling that the text would eventually improve, I would not have read past the first chapter. I hope that the author shows more empathy to his patients than he does to his characters."
2,Nice concept but kinda lame,"I like the idea of women playing sports in the nude, but these videos really are just women running around being stupid. It'd be nice if they made a video where the participants actually knew how to play the sport. Of course, most real athletes wouldn't do it in the nude, at least not for a commercial video. Watching the human body in motion can be a beautiful thing, especially when exhibiting skill. Granted, football isn't a good nude sport, but basketball could be. These videos certainly aren't catering to sports fans or even nudists. It's just more bubble-headed bimbos laughing at their ineptitude. Totally Nude Aerobics is a much better value - better video quality, better looking and more natural women, and more believable exercise. If they could only do that with a team sport..."
4,A little to much light,"The idea of watching girls play sports, and in the nude is enjoyable. You can sit and laugh while the girls try and play. The big proglem I saw is why do they just use one camera man, at time its hard to follow whats going on. Also there was to much sun, and at time the girls were just about taken out of the picture, and you were unable to watch."
2,an interesting book that doesn't quite ring true,"this narrative purported to stay in a child's point of view but faltered time and again. an eleven year old kid would not have the art vocabulary that the author forces into this child's dialogue.the best parts of this book dealt with a young girl's feelings towards a society and body that is forcing her to grow up too quickly. if you are interested in early puberty and being reminded of how many men and teens sexually prey on children, you might like this book. but you'll be disappointed with the author's lack of critical examination of this."
3,A CD WORTH BUYING,"I like all Webster Hall's music. On Disc 1 the only song I like is number 4, called Universal Language. It's a very cool song, it's sounds like a preacher giving a sermon on house music. On Disc 2 there are three great tracks, Space Vibration, Follow the Sun and Colours. There is another version of the track Colours on a different CD ( Tranzworld, Vol. 4 ), the one on this CD is the better mix/version. For the great low price I paid, being able to hear just these four wonderfully made tracks is nevertheless worth buying.Enjoy. President, Brooklyn Institute of Massage Therapy."
4,Tranzworld All Stars 2,"Hey, has anyone heard Tranzworld All Stars 2 yet? I know it's not brand new, but I think it's good. But, it isn't better that the first one. The first CD of Vol. 2 is so awesome, it's all trance and house. The second CD of Vol. 2 starts off good, but then as track 4 kicks in, it become somewhat...boring. It's mostly spanish type music made into trance. Don't get me wrong, it's a good CD, but Vol. 1 is still champion....for now."
4,Groovin' Jazz!,"I first heard Dave Frishberg with Herb Alpert's jazzed-up TJB in '74-75. He's a remarkable pianist, as well as a witty vocalist/composer. On this album he teams up with the great Al Cohn on sax and valve trombonist Bob Brookmeyer. It's a bit of a laid back album, and Frishberg plays in a variety of settings. My favorite tune is ""P-Town"", where the whole band gets some room to blow. Frishberg and Cohn play a few duets together, also. The late Nick Ceroli is the drummer, and he was also in the Tijuana Brass. Tasty music all around."
5,Scrumptious.,"This book contains a myriad of scrumptious recipes that work. It is also full of fascinating information on chocolate and its history. Moreover, it is delightful (and delicious) to just look at."
4,A Funny Bunny Book,"This book is about two long-time neighbors of forty-eight years, Miss Penny and Mr. Grubbs. Miss Penny is a nice lady that is an excellent gardener with a green thumb. She has won numerous prizes for her excellent vegetables. However, Mr. Grubbs is grumpy old man who doesn't share Miss Penny's talent of growing vegetables, and his vegetables are no where near her level. But like I said, he's a grumpy guy, so he plots revenge against Miss Penny by putting bunny rabbits in her backyard. I won't tell you the outcome of this story but it's a good book to read so you'll just have to find out for yourself!"
5,This CD is Great,"This CD never hits a sour note. From beginning to end, Roland spins in his trademark style that is both driving and yet upbeat. One of the best of the ""Circuit Session"" series. A must buy for those attending Perfect Day where they will have an opportunity to experience Roland's work first hand."
4,"Vocal house has its time and place, too...","If only you can make your CD player skip track 3, you'll have a fun, Night at the Roxbury-ish experience listening to this mix. That's not really a bad thing. What keeps me from giving it a 5 is track 3 though. Listen to the screaming chorus and you'll see what I mean..."
4,Circuit Sessions continues with one hot mix after another!,"Yet another awesome entry in the 4 Play Records Circuit Sessions series. DJ Roland Belmares delivers a hodge podge of different styles mixed together effortlessly. This volume in the series is a good follow up to the unmatched brilliance of Volume 7 mixed by Barry Harris of Thunderpuss. 4 Play should tap some other hot circuit DJ's to contribute to this series that just seems to get better and better. Monty Q, Kimberly S, Eddie X.... basically any DJ with an initial for a last name. Add this to your must have collection."
5,Excellent,"I've been using mine with win 98, xp and xp pro since 2001 and its still going strong. Its now on its 3rd PC."
4,Great for Learning Finnish,The Book is excellent for people wanting to learn Finnish. It gives you plenty of excersizes to do along with the lessons. I hear that this is the same text they use at Colleges in Helsinki for English speaking students learning Finnish who are studying in Finland!
5,Soul Graffiti Finds a Savior in the Streets,"Mark does not just write about philosophy or ideals, he tells the stories of a Christian life that is actively embodying the urges of Jesus Christ. Soul Graffiti speaks to those who see the world from an artistic, mystical, and sacred perspective. He speaks to the urban injustices that are happening right next door and how God is an active participant in the lives of the low and forgotten. As a student, artist, and socially conscious Christian, this book is an encouragement to my aching that Jesus' teachings were not meant to only be read, but lived. For those looking to serve a gospel Jesus -- a Messiah who is daring, dirty, poetic, and inspired by compassion -- Mark gives you eyes to see the Teacher's footsteps in the abandoned places less traveled."
1,don't buy it if you're a Grey Flannel fan,"received this alleged Grey Flannel ""eau de toilette"" spray and opened the box to find a light blue version of eau de toilette Grey Flannel. It didn't look like my existing bottle of Grey Flannel so I sprayed some on my wrist and face. THE SMELL ONLY RESEMBLES GREY FLANNEL. IT'S DEFINITELY BEEN WATERED DOWN! Suggest you spend the few extra dollars for the real thing.(As i'm typing this, Amazon reduced the price of what I ordered from $14.14 per bottle to $12.45 per bottle!!!!)"
1,WATERED DOWN TRASH!,"As a huge fan of the Original Gray Flannel, in which I still have a half bottle of the oil version (you know, the REAL version). Unfortunately, I must say this is the true ""WATERED DOWN"" version! What a waste of money. Sure I would have expected this to smell somewhat as the original, and yes, I did expect it to last as long as everyone on the reviews were raving about. Such over exaggeration. I don't care if it's a Toilette Spray, which I can understand why it's called that, because it must be for the toilet.This is truly a waste of money and time. This is NOT Grey Flannel, it is a poor wanna be clone which is watered down and lasts as long as the minute you spray it on. If you read my reviews you will notice I do not give props to garbage, however I do give props to that which is worth the value, and hype.Do yourself a favor, if you want a good smelling spray that lasts, keep looking because this ain't the one!"
1,"Uncomfortable, Dig into your feet.",Very uncomfortable. Feels like plastic support/straps are always digging into your feet from the side and underneath(at the front part of your outer arch)
2,"good style & ease of use, very poor quality materials","the reason I buy Sketchers (and pay the premium price!) is for style, quality and durability. This is the first time I am very disappointed with the quality of materials used by Sketchers. The breathable fabric lining and faux suede-lined cushioned footbed started tearing and now in about 6 weeks of occasional use, I have to throw them! Not worth."
2,Poor fit,"The order came in on time and looked as expected . Maybe it is the shape of my foot or the width of the shoe but on a recent trip to the Carribean, my feet were tore up in these things. Had to go back to sandals to get around."
4,Very Good quality for the money,"It is very good, comfortable and light, only it has a little gap in the front but acceptable.right now I'm using it in week end, but I'm planning to use it more during the summer holiday."
1,"Nice looking, broke in a couple weeks","I like these so well, I ordered another pair. The second pair broke the first time I wore them and these the heal seperated at about week 3. Save your money and buy somthinig else"
4,surprisingly comfortable but slow to dry,"Bought these for a hike in Puerto Rican rain forest. The sandals were comfortable without having to be broken in. The sole provides good grip on slippery rocks and the covered enclosed front keeps you from banging your toes. They took longer to dry after going through water than I had hoped, but did not rub when wet. Also made my feet sweat more than I expected."
3,Poorly made,My husband was so excited to wear these shoes as soon as he got them. He had them on his feet for five days in a row. He loved them and said they were so comfortable. Unfortunately the soft lining in the sole of the shoe came loose and completely fell off. It was really disappointing to see that it couldn't even withstand a week.
3,cappy,"Snug fit, hard to get on and off great for wadeing in water. Very comfortable wearing all day. Need to have a clasp to release making it easyer to put on"
4,Nice,Purchased for my husband and he found them to be very comfortable and stylish. Highly recommend.
3,Caution,"I bought my first pair of these a couple years ago, and liked them so much I bought another pair. But the second pair was not the same as the first. It was easy to see what was different. I'll try to explain it. There is an elastic band that runs from side to side, in front of the ankle. On the original pair, this band of elastic was sewn to the tongue in one spot. On the new pair it is sewn across the full width of the tongue, preventing any stretch of the elastic band. I removed the stitching, thus separating the elastic band from the tongue. Now it fits exactly like my first pair. I may put in a stitch or two, just like the original, but it's not really necessary. I'm OK with this, but I expect that many people would not be, so caution is advised."
3,warning - they run very small!,"Not a bad shoe, but I take generally take a size 10 so I ordered an 11 b/c I've had issues with sketchers before. When I took them out of the box and they are a 1/2 inch shorter than a 10.5 sneakers i have, not even close to a typical 11. I had to pay the return shipping (despite being a prime member) which really pisses me off since I ordered bigger but it still was not enough!"
5,great shoe great price,I purchased this shoe for 29.99 where it retail here in chicago for a minimum of 39.99. It is a great summer shoe to do whatever in..
2,Falling apart in only one month,"I bought a new pair Men's Journeyman - Safaris SKECHERS Sport - Sandal Sale - Style #50492 just last month in June of 2010 and the material on the heel is falling apart on both sandals. I can see a gauze looking material underneath. Other than that I loved these shoes. They looked good, were very comfortable and I planned to wear them all the time during the summer. So I am very disappointed that they are already falling apart. I should have got Keen's like my wife wanted me to do."
2,Nice but not Wide,"Nice pair of men's sandals but unfortunately they had to be returned. Sizing stated extra-wide, however, they were not. Felt more like a medium or wide width."
3,these are smaller than you usually order,"BE WARNED THEY RUN SMALL.....I bought my husband a pair of sketchers sandals last year, and he LOVED them...... and this year I ordered another pair the EXACT SAME KIND .....but these ones ran small so I had to reorder in a size up. Just note this when you are ordering..... the company that I got these through was quite good at returns ie. quick access to postal return slip and that was nice BUT I had contacted them about just sending the next size and they made me go through the whole ordering process again."
1,UGLY,"These are so ugly I can't see how anyone would want to wear them. AVOID, if you have taste anywhere else than inside your mouth. My wife said if she saw any guy wearing these she would offer them her seat on the subway. Strictly for nerds who would wear black socks with wingtips and shorts."
3,No Copying Permission,"Although the content of this book is clearly written and comprehensive, imagine my chagrin when I visited my local copy store and was refused service when I requested that the lesson pattern pages be copied. Directions for enlargement and type of paper to be used were printed right on the pages,but permissions were not secured to allow purchasers to use the patterns pages (which are intregal to the lessons) without getting permission from the publisher. Ridiculous!!!"
1,The clip broke rendering the product useless,"When I tried to attach the clip to a fan blade, it broke immediately. What am I supposed to do with stick-on weights if I don't know where to put them? This product is crap."
3,Beat Dominator,"Beat Dominator's ""Techno Bass"" is a classic example of good bass. Although it might not be one of the best, it was pretty good considering how old it is. if you enjoy older techno bass, pick this one up."
1,um,"In their album, techno-bass, beat dominator has created the album of a lifetime. Whether you are at the club, curling up with a nice book, or getting over a break-up, this CD will fit the mood. With their heavenly beats, and transcendent bass lines, beat dominator has created a album to go in the pantheon of all time greats. The new music Mt. Rushmore reads: The White Album, Thriller, Pet Sounds, and now, Techno-Bass. Toss this album in the stereo and let yourself be moved by the words, ""123456 Bass""."
1,Avoid this CD at all Costs!!!,"Techno Bass by Beat Dominater is one of the worsts CD's I have ever had to listen to. From the first track, the disk is non stop terrible. Lowlights include the annoying female voice in the background singing things like ""How do you say...BASS"" and the guy constantly yelling BASS and B-B-B-B-BASS!!!! at random points. The only reason to purchase this CD would be as a cruel joke or to try to blow out somebody's speakers. Even die-hard techno fans should probably avoid this one."
1,Look at the description. It's 2x3 and not 3x5 !!!!!,Look at the description. It's 2x3 and not 3x5 !!!!!Plus it is plastic flag. It would melt in the sun.
2,Disappointed,The information in this book supposedly from God was an insult to my intellegence. Most of it I believe was just common knowledge. Some of what I read was a little profound if your really young and did not read Neal Donasld Walshe Conversation with God. I will admit I did not finish the book because I just didnt think it was worth reading. I am really disappointed.
5,Awesome!,Looks just like the picture and my friend thought it was hilarious. I liked that the tag had info about Scabies too.
3,Item took long to be shipped,The product was in good condition but took long to be shipped. Order was made on Sept 23 and item was shipped on Oct 8. Seller did not reply to my questions.
4,Soothes red skin,"This lotion is good at calming itchy, irritated skin. It is NOT the same as the antibiotic lotion. That is the KetoChlor, this lotion is the KetoSoothe. I find that it is good to have both on hand. This one is good for relieving irritated skin, the Chlor is good for scabs."
3,Might be good for other ailments.,"My dog is always chewing on his feet & I hoped that this might help him stop, but alas it just wasn't meant to be. Still chewing?"
3,MFTV Highs and Lows,"A typical MFTV movie with a few interesting strenths, but tends to sag and go flat here and there, especially as it skips back and forth between the story and the trial. I bought the film mainly because it has a heavy metal theme. I'm a metal fan and longhair guy and I liked this aspect of the film, and I like seeing Helen Hunt as a headbanger chick. Some of you metalheads might enjoy a few of the cool '80's hair metal parts which are sprinkled throughout the film. The one thing that irritates me about this film besides it being dull here and there is that it indirectly portrays the typical, tired stereotype of the long haired metalheads as ""bad"" and ""evil"", something hollywood wrongly and unfairly always seemed to do with us. If heavy metal isn't your thing you probably won't like this film."
3,Pretty typical weak made for TV type flick,Honestly... I bought it cuz Chad Allen's in it. :) But the mullet... yikes.
4,An emotional turn,"Where Chapter 1 of Sakura Diaries tickles the funny bone, Chapter 2 tugs more at the heart strings. The first episode on the video picks up with a sitcom feel: Touma meets a rival for Mieko's affections in Mashu, the Keio stud previously known only as ""Vest Guy."" And Mashu isn't buying Touma's tale of being an economics major. But the last two episodes focus squarely on Touma and Urara. New light is shed on Urara and Touma's prep school classmate, Akimoto. The intense climax of episode 2, as well as a good dose of character introspection, leave you reaching for the Kleenex. But never fear, fans of the ""comedy"" in romantic comedy. Akimoto and the ever delightful, scene-stealing gal-pal Komi provide the laughs through misty eyes. Even Mashu helps out a bit (if he and Komi don't meet up again, there's no justice in this world). Over all, Chapter 2 keeps you as glued to your TV as the first installment did, and leaves you dying for Chapter 3."
3,Very different from the first,"Having enjoyed the first Sakura Diaries immensely, I eagerly awaited this volume. For the first half of volume 2 I was quite pleased, as there were several scenes that were laugh-out-loud funny. Midway through, however, the story took a decidedly not-funny turn. I don't want to spoil it, but I must say I was rather disturbed by this. I did think it was well handled, but be prepared for it. You'll know it when it happens, and it is NOT a fantasy sequence.I can't wait for the next one to come out, though."
3,Events go too far...,"Everything presented in the first DVD begins to develope through the second DVD. Poor Tounma finally snaps and agressive attacks Urara in a shocking, sort of, sexual situation dealing with his inability to resist her sexual taunts. Amazingly the writer makes the reprocussions seem absolutely embarrasing. However, as you find by the end of this series, things arent always as simple as they seem and the issues of control are complicated and layered pretty cunningly. Good stuff for the lovey anime fan."
1,No ending=bad series,"A pleasant enough series, but it does not end--it simply stops. It like there is another disk missing. As such I can give it only 1 star.A pity, but there you go."
3,"Rape was interesting, but treated poorly.","I was really glad that they did do something on sexual ssault, but Touma is a jerk! And I don't think it was given enough gravity. ut at least they did discuss it. As for the rest of the ep, not bad at all."
4,hubba hubba!,This movie was totally awesome -I've watched ity several times these last couple of days -especially when my girlfriend wasn't home! -hubba hubba!
3,Just so-so,"This didn't greatly capture my attention, though Keaggy is certainly a great guitarist. You may like it though. It's a change for Keaggy doing instrumental blues/rock, etc."
4,Great songs and licks,"Phil has always been a great musician. He has written many great songs, including those on this collection. It has been a while since he'd put together a total electric collection like this one. This collection has excellent variety. Super!This collection is great back ground music while working around the house, in the yard, at the office, walking through the mall, reading a book, or while working out.I wish Phil would have included lyrics to some of these songs. But then it wouldn't be a great back ground music collection.I recommend this to anyone looking for great back ground music."
3,like the holster the bottle sucks,I bought this because i needed a new holster for my job. The holster part is good quality but the bottle taht came with it sucks. the bottle doesnt even pump.
4,Good holster,"I accidentally set a full suitcase on top of the bottle and it held up. It has a small dent in it, but it still works. The pump isn't as good as the one the massage school gave me when I enrolled, but it does the job. I may eventually replace the bottle."
2,Massage bottle and holster,"DON""T buy it for the bottle. It LEAKS!!!! The design of the pump is really bad and if you tip it on its side or upside down it will POUR out!! Holster is fine...very long strap which easily can be cut or sewn to shorten if needed."
1,I would not recomend this product,"So i have many problems with this product.First the bottle they provide you with leaks! Yes! leaks! one of the first times i used it i left the bottle on it's side in my handbag and not only did it leak oil all over the handbag but it wasted an entire bottle of very expensive massage oil! it is not a one time thing, it leaks all the time.Second my massage uniform is white and the black strap left stains all over it. Plus i don't like the weird half bitten apple on the design. When i was buying it i didn't see the logo because it is kind of hidden by the bottle. I don't think it looks very professional and not suitable for a spa environment."
2,Sounds tinny to me,I bought this product for my 10 year old son. It looks pretty but the sound is awful. I can't believe I paid $90. for this boom box.
1,I love this toy,"""Now show us on the figure where the TSA agent touched you?""Perfect prop for taking your kids to court after being violated by TSA."
1,Perfect for catastrophic data loss,"This drive worked beutifully in the first 6 months, regardless of the infrequent unexplained miscommunication with the 3 PCs in our school lab. After I trusted it for all our lab work and research data backup, done just once every month, it suddenly gave clicking sounds and stopped working. After extended agony with the customer support, I got no understanding or even the will to help or just listen. Surperisingly, when I talked about this subject with some of my collegues in our University, I discovered that many of them, in defferent departments, suffered from the same problem with different models of the Wistern Digital external hard drives (USB/Firewire).After all the frustration and the torture with this piece of junk that I trusted with my work, I can say for sure, Buy WD if you are looking for the best machine to lose your data? Beleive me when I say Western Digital Hard Drives are absolutely the worst for your data storage. We've been there."
4,Very Nice Product,This product is simple and easy to use. It is exactly what it promises and even easier to use than I had originally thought. I would recommend this inexpensive product for anyone looking for a backup unit/external drive. Thank you Tiger Direct for selling it dirt cheap in addition I might add.
1,It doesnt work,"I have only owned this item as for 6 months and it simply stopped working. This is supposed to be my backup and now it absolutely doesnt work. The company requires I pay to fedex it them to Thailand and will not recover the data for me. By the time I ship it and pay for data recovery, if it can be, I will have spent as much as I did on the drive in the first place. Buy from a better company."
3,Freaky,"Does anyone else find it extremely freaky that a group named I Am the World Trade Center had a cd out before 9/11 but the 11th track of the cd is titled ""September""?!?!?!?!?"
5,"Fans of Fates Warning, Old Queensryche and older Metallica..","When I popped in the CD, I had no idea what to expect, except that a friend in college used to play their first CD all the time and I grew to love it. I wasn't sure if this was going to be the same one, but even though it wasn't I am completely overwhelmed by the emotion that just drips off this CD!!! The vocals just rip and then fall back, the interplay between the 2 guitarists is simply incredible and the drumming and bass work is solid throughout the whole CD. It is progressive, but not so much as to turn me away... this is easily one of the best CDs I've bought since Parallels and Operation Mindcrime!!! Now I need to get their other album. It is very dark, heavy, yet very melodic... and I remembered some of the choruses right off the bat, which is rare for me. If the band reads this, ""GREAT JOB GUYS, YOU ROCK!!!"""
1,Free on the bose website,"DO NOT PAY FOR THESE... Go to the Bose website if you need a replacement pair. They send you a pack (for free, don't even pay shipping)that includes small, medium, and large earpieces."
1,Update: As of 26 March 2009,"Just want to update everyone regarding the tips for these. Bose WAS previously issuing these tips for free, but from my conversation with Bose Customer Service today, they do not do this anymore. Essentially, Bose is not giving them for free anymore, and they must be purchased from them now. All in all it costs less than $8 for them. Just an FYI."
1,Leave it to BOSE! (Do NOT buy),"Wow. . . I lost an earbud the other day. Started searching and saw this bizarre (bordering on $20) price and was going to trash the headset.Then I read about the BOSE program, 2 clicks and my complete new set was on the way.Amazing.CourtneyNew York City"
4,No longer Free,Bose no longer offer the replacements for free apparently. They do offer the replacements for a fee for all sizes of the tips.
1,DON'T BUY,Don't buy these there free at any Bose store. Just show them your headphones and they'll give you new ones
1,Bose NO Longer Offers Free Replacement Tips,"I would give these a ZERO if I could. I love the sound quality, but the tips SUCK! They no longer offer replacement tips (mine disintegrated after 4 uses). They now charge $6.99. This is the 2nd Bose product I have purchased that fell apart after a few short uses. I bought the Tri-Port over the ear headphones, and they fell apart after less than a week of use. Beware of purchasing any Bose headphones. They obviously don't do any type of quality control before releasing a product."
5,Piece of Cake is Absolutely Flavorfull!,"Piece of Cake was originally broadcast on PBS about 10 years ago. It covers a squadron of Spitfire pilots just before the German invasion of France. The actions and interactions of the group is what makes this special. As is common in war, not everyone survives. The combat scenes are excellent, even with only a few actual working Spitfires in existence during filming. A must for WWII devotees."
5,"Best Spitfire movie ever, and human, too.","I've had my ""Piece of Cake"" from you for some time, and have re-watched it frequently. This three-disc (color) DVD, about a single squadron, is not only a beautifully shot, well-cast and well-acted movie about the early days of World War Two and the Battle of Britain. It is also the most gorgeous portrayal of Spitfires in action ever made (and this recognizes the classic, all-star ""Battle of Britain"" movie made in 1969, itself an excellent portrayal of ""the Few""). The film is, in addition, a human movie, including sensitive roles for the men and women on the ground who were an integral part of the war in the air."
4,Squadron life,A nice serie. Can enjoy the life of a Squadron in the times of War. Different caracters enjoyable. Flew Spitfires a little too early in time.
2,Not a Great Value,I saw this series when it was originally aired by PBS on Masterpiece Theater. What is just average is the quality of the reproduced video. It is pretty poor at best. The flying scenes go almost black and white and the rest is pretty dismal. Obviously little care was used in transferring the original film or video to the copies. This is a great film series and deserves to be of the quality of the original.
4,"Once the shooting starts, it's great","If I could describe ""Piece of Cake"" in a single phrase I would use ""off-centered."" As noted by other reviewers, a good deal of the story unfolds in the Phony War period. This is not altogether boring, but frankly, the series should have concentrated on the 1940 Battle of France and the Battle of Britain (the latter of which gets dealt with rather peremptorily).This being said, the flight scenes and combat are first-rate. For me, a particularly haunting bit was the last flight of the squadron commander Rex. The notion of a badly wounded man high as a kite on morphine trying to lead a squadron of fighters into the buzz saw of the Luftwaffe is sobering and pathetic to say the least.So for anyone who rents or buys this, I would say if you get bored in the first several hours start fast forwarding it to the combat. You won't be bored watching that."
1,Very poor transaction.,"I returned it and four others as it was not compatible for our New Zealand region, as we require Pal. It was our wish to have them changed over, but no one wants to know us. So, no more dealings with Amazon and we will spread the word."
3,"Was ""Moggy"" real","I remember the introduction given by Alistair Cooke about the many strange characters in the squadron. He said something like ""Veterans of the time tell me that they recognised all the characters as people they encountered but not all at the same time and in the same squadron"". This is confirmed by my own experience in Vietnam. I saw all the types over 2 tours, including a CO who insisted in tight formation flying. The typical helicopter pilot's idea of formation flying is ""same day, same way"". Eventually enough of the discontent of the pilots filtered upstairs and he was 'promoted' to a desk job. With that caveat, the series is well done and worth seeing.A point worth making is that at the begining of every war, the troops have to find out what works and what doesn't, often at the cost of lives. Tight formation flying was a case in point. Essential in WW1, deadly in WW2."
5,Those were the days,"i ordered this set of DVD's titled ""Piece of Cake"" and they were as advertised.I enjoy watching them over and over."
4,My opinion,"I am of the older generation and lived through the War (WWII) years. When I first saw this production years back on Masterpiece Theater with Host Alistair McLean, I enjoyed every moment of the moving emotional story of men at war and all the exciting action. I thought then, how well done this production was done in terms of story, acting and the truly authentic locales. I was particularly happy for the closed captions as I have always not completely understand the British accent when I saw this series on PBS Television. Years later, I am now partially deaf and CC would have been a tremendous DVD feature but Alas such is not the case. I still am happy I purchased it though just to watch the most magnificent flight and action of the incomparable ""Spitfire"" fighter doing what it did better than any other aircraft, win the skies over England."
5,A different story,"I enjoyed the cryptic remarks made by the bookish Intel officer. His take on the attitude of the Poles on prewar boundaries and the real probability of going to war with Russia was too funny. I have often wondered the samwe thing. If Poland was the agrieved party...didnt Russia attack them also? Or was it just the anti Germanism that still dominates movies. In other words maybe the Germans were an injured party as well. The Merican pilot was a likeable guy and he tried his best to bring democracy to the war...lotsa luck. All things considered, it was a real enjoyable offbeat look at real people in unreal situations."
3,Piece of Cake - A Bit of a Disappointment,"I loved the book. I guess they had to use Spitfires instead of Hurri's to show something flying, but it's too bad. The musical score is wonderful. My major complaint is the diminution of the role of Chris Hart (CH3), and the general watering down of the issues of operational tactics, service snobbery, parochialism and journalistic futility that really constitute the major thematic elements of the story. I really expected better from the British producers. The visual quality of the DVD is also disappointing."
2,"Add half-a-star, but this isn't up to the usual standards...","The first three hours, half the show, were dull, stodgy, and confusing. The second half was much, much better, with lots of aerial combat and some male-female relationships which seemed promising. However, the final half has too much tragedy, no humor except some attempts to lighten the mood which come off as cruel. I never really found a character to root for in the whole darn thing, save for Boyd Gaines, who plays Hart, the only American among this bunch of Royal Air Force flyboys. And it was hard, frankly, to even care much about him. It is sad when a six-hour miniseries about something as important as the start of World War II leaves one with kudos only for the cinematography, but that's how I felt when I finished watching this the other night. The aerial shots of the White Cliffs of Dover are what I will remember most, not the script or performances."
2,Poor story,"The footage of the aircraft flying is excellent. Unfortunately the characters are unlikable and the plot motivates you to stop watching. I was interested as I watched ""Piece of Cake"" because of my extreme interest in World War Two, however I can't say that I ""enjoyed"" it. The characters are hard to distinguish from each other and nearly impossible to empathize with.Unfortunately I just can't recommend ""Piece of Cake"". Poor writing, poor characters, poor character development (non-existant?), poor plot. Beautiful aircraft, decent acting and fascinating bits historical realism just aren't enough to save ""Piece of Cake""."
1,Horrendous Fiction,"I had the occasion to talk to Johnny Johnson once about this ""Piece of ..."". I was curious to know his opinion because the story line and characters seem to have little to no bearing on reality. Having accumulated a significant library on the subject of the RAF and BoB I was more than disappointed and found each episode increasingly appalling.I don't think I can publish the response I got from Johnny Johnson ... lets just say the story line is the WORST kind of fiction. Those who took part in this should be ashamed."
1,piece of cake should be a piece of c***,"overworked script, underworked, no name british actors, and an almost dream inducing (yawn) musical score combine to made a typically overrated brit film. about the run up and beginning of the battle of britain, this sleeper will have you taking leisurely strolls to the bathroom and the fridge. i mean, when the highlight of a five hour movie occurs in the first 2 minutes, well, you get the picture or rather..dont get the picture! YAWN !!"
5,Another Piece of Cake,"Bought this movie several years ago and just finished looking again at this series. There seem to be many poor reviews which I disagree with, so I thought it needed a clean approach to a very good story. I'm sure ""Johnny Johnson"" a Battle of Britain survivor would not like this movie. This film shows the terrible British tradition of ""class"" distinction, and their distaste for the US warrior. I think this story provides the real class structure of the British during the mid 20th century and the Nobles Noblige snobbery of that time. The acting is good and the flying sequences performed by real pilots without the use of computers was superb. Jeremy Northam became a first class British actor who starred in classics movies like ""Emma"" and ""Enigma"".I only wish this movie would be transferred to the Blu-ray format with 5.1 sound. If so I would make a new purchase for my movie library"
4,Good Book,"This book provides good information and indepth detail about chineese herbs that can be used. Most of the book is about the herbs and different combinations that can be used, but it's mostly for someone who is advanced in their knowledge of TCM. For a novice like myself it seems over my head. Most of the herbs described are ones I had not heard of and are hard to find. Personally I think this book is more for the TCM practitioner."
3,Useful but not necessarily user friendly...,I believe this can be a useful tool but one needs to highlight pages and herbs that one might possibly use for common ailments. Many diseases are not covered-I did not see anything dealing with hypo or hyperactive thyroid for example. There may be a better website and that is where I intend to look now.
4,13 Tracks From 1972 - 1979.,"Their were few bigger or more influential bands to come out of the 1970s than The Eagles.From the albums came:Eagles (1972):Take It Easy.Peaceful, Easy Feeling.Desperado (1973):Desperado.Tequila Sunrise.On The Border (1974):Best Of My Love.One Of These Nights (1975):Lyin' Eyes.Take It To The Limit.One Of These Nights.Hotel California (1976):Hotel California.New Kid In Town.Life In The Fast Lane.The Long Run (1979):Heartache Tonight.The Long Run.I first bought the album One Of These Nights and then the remainder above, but to have just one CD which covers many of their best songs is very welcome.Of the total of 60 minutes music I prefer the driving Take It Easy, the soft Peaceful, Easy Feeling, the soaring Take It To The Limit and the mystifing Hotel California.Larger collections are easy to find, but this one takes me back to the 1970s West Coast all on one disc."
3,MISSING A FEW HITS,"Never mind that this is missing ""Victim of Love"", ""The Sad Cafe"", ""Ol '55"", ""Doolin-Dalton"", ""Outlaw Man"" and the Christmas single (among others)...it's actually missing four of their greatest hits!Missing in action:* ALREADY GONE* WITCHY WOMAN* LIFE IN THE FAST LANE* I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY"
5,Strong Second Book,"I was delighted to find this new book by Barrientos, whose first novel Frontera Street I added to my growing shelf of titles by favorite Latina writers. I especially liked how Family Resemblance explored the main characters' roots - in this case Guatemalen - as a family mystery was solved. I also very much like how Barrientos has continued to create strong female characters, whatever their nationalities."
2,Family Resemblence,"This book was very wordy and the story drawn out. The point was made early on and it dragged along tediously. The main character was unsympathic, whining and a general bore. I read it because of an obligation to my book club but would not recommend it further."
1,Save your $,"Save your $, you are not going to get ""abs"" following this diet alone. Ab's are from a strict diet, exercise and luck (yes, genes are a big part of abs). This is REALLY basic knowledge so if you need basic knowledge that you cannot find free online go for it."
3,I'm on the fence,"On the one hand the book has inspirational stories of others success, recipes, shopping guidelines, meal ideas, and a quick summary of the Abs Diet plan. On the other hand it's a summary of the Abs Diet.I think it's helpful, it is small enough to keep in a person or briefcase for daily reminders. I just don't know if it's necessary.If you need the extra boost and motivation, okay, then I think you should get the Eat Right Every Time Guide. Initially I thought it would be more of what to eat at every opportunity guide. That's not really what it is. There is some of that in there, but that is not the whole book and it isn't easy to navigate the book to get the information you want fast enough."
2,get the first book skip this one,I found this one usless. If you need or have time to follow recipes it might be better but I gave this one away.
4,The Perfect Diet,"This diet is so easy to follow! There are plenty of different foods to choose from so it's not restrictive and doesn't get boring. Plus the recipes in the book are super easy to make (trust me, I'm domestically challenged and I can still do it). And who doesn't like to eat six times a day? I give it a big thumbs up. It's working for me!"
5,Life Changing,Everything I needed to get my diet on the fast track to success. Lots of great meal ideas most of which are quick and easy to fix. Full of helpful information for grocery shopping too. A life changing book
2,noncompatible,"I ordered this scanner thinking that it can scan documents into pdf format to be opened with Adobe Acrobat Reader; however, it needs it's own software to scan and open the documents. I am not satisfied with this product for the price spent on it. If you dont mind having to use the specific software to use the scanner - then this will fit your needs. I recently found out that you will have to download Digimax PDF software from the manufacturer's website if you want instand pdf files. The software will be for the M12 Plus model, but it works."
1,Plus Tek Customer Service HORRIBLE,"I was really excited about the size and quality of scans I got until the second time I used it when a mysterious black line showed up. I reinstalled the drivers, recalibrated, and cleaned several times with the same results. I am running Windows Vista Business.I tried calling PlusTek for assistance. Needless to say, it took 3 weeks, numerous emails and phone calls for them to respond and the only solution they have is to send it back. No immediate replacement. So now, my ability to scan and finalize jobs is down for three weeks plus the time for the repairs and shipping.Think I'll try another brand and sell the 'refurbished' one on ebay."
3,Much better than the last one,Although this is not Niche's best work...this is a great CD to listen to; a vast improvement over the last CD which was very unlike them.
4,Very good buy for these Braces,"My foot dr had suggested a richie brace which is much more expensive, but these seem to do the trick for me."
4,"not perfect, but nothing is","These make a nice substitute for taping, as they are strong and light. They are not quite thin enough that you will be able to to tighten your shoes the same, but they are pretty close.I have used and own several other styles, but this is my favorite brace I've found. I wear mine for basketball, and while they will not prevent a catastrophic sprain like I am recovering from, they provide the support and reassurance you need to be able to work your ankle back into shape.If you have unlimited free tape, and somebody to do it for you, go with it. If you want something strong, light, flexible without feeling unstable, and as thin as one can expect, try these."
2,BCO2 is getting long in the tooth,"BCO2 was published in 1989 and the latest references are from the late 1980's. Opening theory has come a long way since then which makes this book of limited usefulness in 1998. Unfortunately, BCO3 and MCO14 are not even rumored yet, leaving an up-to-date single-source reference unavailable to tournament players. If you must have a copy of this book, try not to pay too much for it."
2,this Invasion isnt worth the wait,"Luke Perry (The Fifth Element, Buffy The Vampire Slayer The Movie) plays Beau Stark who gets infected by some kind of intity that courses threw his body and soon after the whole entire planet gets infected just like Beau did but Beau is special, he is the key to a gateway...the chosen one. Rebecca Gayheart (Tv's Dead Like Me, Urban Legend 1 and 2) plays Cassy, Perry's girlfriend who with a band of un infected people, including Kim Cattrall (Tv's Sex and The City, Porkys) and Jon Polito (The Crow, With Friends Like These...) go on a search for an antibody to stop whatever Beau is going to do. Interesting subject by author Robin Cook is sqaushed like a bug on the side of the road with its dreadful acting with wooden performances altough Perry has some good moments. An Invasion with no fun whatsoever. Special effects are dull. Also starring Neal McDonough (Ravenous, Walking Tall, Tv's BoomTown) as Perry's partner in this invasion."
3,pRETTY GOOOD if u like this kinda music...,Nice cd .. If you liike this kinda music then you will Enjoy this Cd here .
3,Great user reference,"""Windows 98 from A to Z"" is the very comprenhesive book about using Windows 98. It can be used by absolute beginners, but it is more suitable for the people that are already aquainted with windows operating system. Sorting the chapters by alphabetic order is a very good idea because it can easily be used as a reference for all users. Despcription are very precise and filled with pictures. For a standard user this book can bring many news that are easily found and well described. This book is a good choice for every user of this operating system!"
3,Many versions of Islam,"Dr. Chittic has done a fine job introducing Islam in this book, however there are a few shortcomings and ommisions. People ask me if Islam is as introduced in this book then why so much violence and terror manifested by the followers of this religion. The answer is that there are many versions of Islam, in fact there are as many versions of Islam as there are moslems living in this world..."
4,Horn's motor needs less than 12 volts DC,"This is essentially identical to the Carrand Old Timer Horn, but at a more reasonable price. Both the Wolo 330 and the Carrand are made in China. I have both, and apart from the painted-on chrome of the Carrand Old Timer Horn, the construction, electric motor, and materials are the same. My Wolo 330 sounds a lot raspier than my Carand. The sound that comes out of the Wolo 330 can be described as ""oooorh,"" and definitely not ""ahoogah."" I think this is because the electric motor is either too powerful, or it's actually rated to run on 6 volts instead. Quality control varies, because I've measured impedance on several units, and they measured anywhere from 0.7 ohms to 2 ohms! I lowered the voltage and current by putting a 1.75 or a 2 ohm resistor in series at the positive (+) end, and backed off the adjustment bolt at the back of the horn until I got the classic ""ahoogah"" sound. Don't do this yourself; have your mechanic install it for you."
1,Dissapointed,"I had a aoohgaa horn about 25 years ago, i thought this one would be simular but the sound produced is a more high pitched and not giving the same effect. This horn is about half the size of the original horn i had and i would say 1/4 the sound quality."
2,Poor Sound,"Poor Sound Quality, even after adjusting horn. Should have better mounting bracket, possibly metal instead of plastic. Would choose another horn next time."
3,Draws a lot of current,I hooked it up to multiple dry cell batteries for 12V and it seems to need a car battery with much more current capability.
4,Pretty fun!,"There isn't quite as much ""Oooga"" as I was hoping for, but still fun. We have a old golf cart we use the putts around the neighborhood - this is a fun ad-on."
4,"Entertaining, But Digressions Into Modern Day Bothered Me","These stories are entertaining and informative. He tells a continuous narrative of early British history by piecing together vignettes.As a poorly-educated American I often lost the strand of the vignettes. Kings from one century merged into another. Basically, the idea I get from this book is that historically the lives of Brits were nasty, brutish and short.The book finishes with the tale of Wat Tyler. Britons are as oppressed at the end of the book as they are at the beginning.Occasionally this author lets us know his opposition to the recent US and UK led war against Saddam, and possibly, to other US policies in the Mideast. If I were Mr. Lacey's editor I would have deftly incised these passages from the text in order to produce a timeless narrative that concentrates on an ancient era."
5,GOLDEN REVIEW,THE LEAVES OF GOLD BOOKS WERE JUST LIKE THE ONE I'VE HAD FOR YEARS. THE TREASURED STORIES AND POEMS NEVER LOSE THEIR APPEAL. THESE WILL MAKE GREAT GIFTS FOR GOLDEN WEDDING ANNIVERSARY PRESENTS.
3,Easily broken,"This is, of course, a very inexpensive but useful item. Anyone who has installed one of these knows just how brittle the clear plastic can be, so you need to be careful of just how tight you screw down the switch plate over it. Anyway, mine arrived already ""pre-cracked,"" likely achieved in the sorting and stacking of mail somewhere along the line. It arrived in a small bubble lined envelope, but it's hard to ask a company to ship a single shield in packaging that cost more than the item. Order a dozen instead."
5,Wonderful autobiography,"This is a wonderfully written autobiography. Very interesting reading of a interesting life. You will learn a lot about the spirit of different times and places. The relation of Hemmings with Britten, Antonioni... Every page is a treasure."
2,"fraught with errors, redundant","I was fascinated by the subject and couldn't wait to read the book. Within the first 60 pages, I noted 5 errors. This book needed a better proofreading staff. I also got sick of reading that I had to understand the context of certain remarks to understand the 'deep meaning.' It was redundantly stated with every example. I understood Dr. Haskell's position that reading about many examples of 'deep listening' would make it easier to listen deeply, but to read with nearly every example that in order to understand the 'deep meaning,' I would have to understand the context of the remarks was annoying and boring. I love the topic, but I can't recommend this book to anyone. If you're really interested, see if your local library has a copy. Don't buy this book. You'll be sorry. I am."
1,"Nice cover and idea, nonsensical content",Absolute nonsense. Takes a few sources of anecdotal evidence and tries to turn into something scientific. Pass.
3,Not to bad,"I recently bought this unit. It's a wonderful option not having wires, arm bands or bulky units. Depending on your headshape, the unit can be uncomfortable on the ears. Unfortunatly, its bubble packed, so you can't tell how it fits until you buy it. Sony does have a model that comes without the TV/Weather tuner, which sells for around $40. I would recommend buying the unit with the AM/FM tuner - saves $ and a little more practicle."
5,Good stuff,"I've had these little suckers for almost a year now. I love them. Lightweight, sweat-resistant. The function buttons are easy to maneuver once you learn where they are and practice a little. I have used these in 2 different gyms, an apt clubhouse workout room, and outside and I get good reception in all areas. The mega bass feature is what sold me; the sound is excellent. I have been very pleasantly surprised."
2,NOT WELL MADE,I bought this type radio last year by sony and now it is broken. I liked it but it did get uncomfortable after long use and as I said in about 1 1/2 yrs it is now broken. I don't think it is worth it.
1,Disappointed,"This radio does not receive the one FM station I want. It was bubble wrapped and I couldn't try it in the store. It's great looking, but useless for me -- I'm going to take it back."
3,Good sound but fragile headset,"I gave this S2 to my mom for Mother's Day. After a few weeks, the very fine speaker wire that runs inside of the headband somehow became unsecured and exposed. It was then accidentally pulled as my mother removed it one day and the fine wire tore, rendering the unit unplayable.It has been almost impossible contacting Sony for repair. When I finally reached them, the repair costs for this small repair were unwarranted and I ended up purchasing a new unit at a discount outlet. Sony is engineering is good but their service is terrible. This is not a good prospect for a consumer in the long run."
4,I like them,"I'm a construction worker and I wear these around my jobsites. I like them because I can still wear a hat, and there's no antenna sticking up. They put up with abuse well, cloth ear covers wear out very quickly. The digital tuner, with presets, is really necessary for station changes. I can't be standing around fiddling with my tuner all day.I agree with the reception complaints, and I don't need weather or TV (although Sesame Street in audio only is amuzing). After all day my earlobes are definately sore, but I think that cannot be avoided if the radio is going to hang off of them.All-in-all this is the only headset I'll use. The orientation and the station pre-sets set it completely apart from all others I've seen."
1,NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BULLS**T!,"I bought this for 18 bucks. Quite a great deal for a Sony, eh? However, right at the first time I used it, I was totally disappointed! I couldn't trace my favourite station which I used to listen to on my car at all. Quality is really bad, not like a Sony one supported to be. Moreover, it was made in China, I personally avoid stuffs made from China coz I don't trust the quality of products from that country much. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR A GREAT NIGHT WITH YOUR GIRLFRIENDS, FELLAS!"
1,Don't even bother trying these,"This headset was the worst thing I ever tried. They were so uncomfortable I could not wear them. In addition to that, the sound was very tinny, even with the super mega bass on. Take a pass on these and look for something else."
2,a disappointment - I expected much better from Sony,"The headphones are unpadded and quite uncomfortable. The FM reception was poor - I heard plenty of static on some local stations. I believe Sony made a major design error in not adding an antenna to this radio. The 30 presets include 15 FM, plus 5 each for TV, AM, and weather. I wish there had been more for AM. Since I could get only one weather channel, which was about 60% static, the 5 presets went to waste. It is interesting to be able to listen to TV stations on a radio, but Sony needs to go back to the drawing board to make this device listener-friendly."
3,It's Okay But.....,"I would say the cons are, it does start hurting where it goes around your ear. Luckily the ear tips of mine broke off which makes it a little more comfortable. FM reception is fair. Could be better. It does need an antenna for better FM reception. It can do without the TV channels. Weather channel is okay to have. Oh, but your ears get sore, maybe if you wear them enough times your ears get numb to them."
3,"GOOD QUALITY, BAD FIT...","I had high hopes for the Sony SRFHM01V Sport Walkman radio. I was willing to pay a little more for quality. The reception was great, it was lightweight, it was a dream come true...until my ears started hurting. After about a half-hour's wear, the soreness started behind my ears where the ear hooks hang. (Ear hooks are nice to prevent the radio from falling off the head while looking down.) This was not mild irritation. I tried bandaids to cushion behind my ear and even weather stripping! These ""remedies"" didn't work. Then, where the earpads rested on my ears made my entire outer ears hurt. Putting foam protectors on the ear pads did wonders for relieving the irritation to my outer ears. I didn't find a solution for the ear hook pain, so I ended up returning the radio and got a full refund."
2,Where's the Reception?,"I bought these to use at the gym for working out and on the treadmill. Needless to say, it didn't work at all. No reception. Now, my bulky walkman I previously used worked fine, so I know there isn't much distortion in the gym, but the signal gets lost somewhere in these headphones.Do not recommemend!!I returned it yesterday..."
2,Overview of pk modeling,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this book is over-priced, especially when compared to the scant content. It's listed as 139 pages, but, considering the small 6x9 format, the book contains less than 100 pages of material.The material that is contained within the book is well-presented, and the chapters are logically sequenced, each building on the other. The illustrations and tables are relevent and supplement the text nicely. However, each chapter is but a short, cursory review, there is not enough detail. What Bourne presents here is more like an outline of what he could have written.This book might be helpful to pharmaceutical scientists who use ADAPT, BOOMER, MULTI, NONMEM, or other programs for modeling pharmacokinetic data. However, there is little here for practicing pk clinicians."
2,I couldn't believe it was only one package weighing 14 oz.,"I saw several different offerings of brownulated sugar. I'd missed baking with this as it seems unavailable since I moved West. Unfortunately, I didn't pay close enough to which offering I selected. Others were a much better value as you got several packages for the money. The product was very good, but who would willingly pay that price for 14 oz of brown sugar. I'll read the listings more carefully next time."
5,Page Turner!,"There are no words to describe how good this book was. It's a page turner that you never want to put down. It's a emotional book that pulls you in. It's about a struggling 15 year old boy named Kenny. His mother trys to control his life, and his father is an ex-con. Kennny gets fed up with his mom and desides to do somthing with his life. This is a must read and i hope u like it as much as i did."
3,"I had to read it, but I didn't have to like it.","The book is useful on theory. It did help me prep my thesis and confirm that I was properly applying academic theory. Not so much fun. If you are looking at this book, you probably need to read it anyway."
1,Worth about $1 check the dollar store first,"Piece of junk, poorly made and not worth the $10 + shipping that I paid. Especially to find out that the dollar store sells the same ones. Total rip off.The black light doesn't go on when you press on, you have to bang it on the table to get it to connect at times.Once batteries are installed the cover to replace is awkward and doesn't fit very good."
2,Portable Blacklight,"I thought it would detect much more.I purchased it to aid me in how clean surfaces and things were, but it wouldn't highlight anything.Either what I tested on were really clean (which I doubt), or the thing really didn't do what I expected."
4,Blacklight,"I bought this as a prank gift for a co worker who is obsessed with cleaning. He uses it every day before leaving to clean up random things. Best money I ever spent, seeing him think everything he sees as rat pee and go into clean mode."
1,Low quality budget product,I got this to go around an apartment we were looking at renting so we could check for stains in the carpets being that the previous people had pets. It lasted about 20 minutes got hot and melted the circuit board internally and would not work anymore. Oh well 20 minutes was enough to see what I suspected and did not rent the apartment.
1,Portable 6 inch Blacklight,"Ordered this for a science project- burned up first time we tried to use it- Which really stinks because we live in the mountains of Colorado and there just was not a lot of options fortunately I ran to Walmart got a desk lamp, black light bulb (last one they had) and a few extension cords-- Totally disappointed in this portable black light! One star is one to many in the rating :/"
1,Horrible product,"Once you put in batteries it will only last a few hours and it is absolutely impossible to get the batteries out to replace them. (I tried EVERYTHING) Product is only good for one time use, better to spend more for a stater quality black light you can re use."
1,Get what you pay for,"I foolishly only ordered one of these. It was faulty out of the box, didn't work, and I haven't been able to make it work yet. I'd imagine some of them will work as they are quite simple, however, I was not so lucky."
2,Not what I thought.,"I haven't been to a hotel yet to really use this. But it was not what I was expecting. It's very small, not sure how it will hold up. It seems to work ok for what I tried it on. However it's cheaply made."
1,Bad Idea,"I was so excited to get this. It arrived on time, I put the batteries in it and it started smoking. Wow! Thank goodness Amazon has a fantastic return policy. I got all my money back in less than a week. Thats why I love Amazon...good protection from bad ideas.Now I know why this guy sold so cheap."
1,Up in smoke,This is a horrible product. Within 10 mins of use it started to smoke and quit working. It's a total waste of money.
1,Broke and caught on fire within first 2 minutes,"I bought this light to use in my classroom for a Glo-Germ project. Every part of it was falling apart as soon as I opened it. Once I finally got it to stay together (using lots of tape), the internal wiring started smoking profusely. I am throwing this piece of trash in the garbage. Please do not waste your money!"
2,Black Light,Black light works but the quality is very poor. each and every parts are cheaply made . I broke it first time when I tried to put battery. Poor quality product. will not recommend to buy.
1,Very Weak,The light is very weak. It doesn't really do what I needed it for unfortunately. Buy a different light .
2,black light does not work.,The blacklight does not work. Please send a replacement light. I put new batteries in when I got it.Blacklight worked a short time. Flashlight works ok.
1,Defective Blacklight,"The product I received was outright defective and began burning the first time I used it. IT IS NOT UL / CE RATED. First impression is very underwhelming. The switch takes too much force to move, and OFF is in the middle position - the perfect combination for having to struggle to turn the device off. I used two hands to turn it on and off. The showstopper though was when I used it for a continuous amount of time for the first time. It had been on, sitting on a table on the handy kickstand for about 5 minutes, when it began emitting smoke and a smell of burning plastic. Unable to turn it off, I had to pry the batteries out to stop the slow burn. Before it burned, I turned it on twice for about 10-15 seconds just to see that it works. NOTE: This review is about the model sold in April 2012, the current picture shows a modified model. Hopefully the switch works better but I wouldn't trust it to not burn."
1,Smell of burning,Inserted batteries and there was a brief smell of burning and a haze of smoke. Black light never functioned but the regular one did. Contacted seller who never replied to my email.
2,Defective,"I am not going to say anything bad about the shipper, it is just my product happen to have been defective. loose battery cap and missing connector part to illuminate.I think it was a fluke error and I'm sure others have had better improvements."
2,Not so much,Worked great for about 60 seconds after getting it out of the box...then the UV light bulb went out. You get what you pay for.
1,got riped off,i orderd this and they took my money and never gave me the product cheats im still dealing with the shipper they have not yet responded to my e mails and i really dont think they will and its not amazons faut this product is from an outside scorce
1,Busted Blacklight,"It came in the mail quickly, But it did not work. Disappointing I gave it one star because it came faster than expected."
2,so so,"It wasn't as bright as I thought it was, but it did work. I just gave it to my 4yr old to play with."
1,Garbage. Do not purchase.,Doesn't work. Piece of garbage. Difficult to insert batteries. Poorly made. Avoid at all costs. I'm not faulting seller. Am chastising myself for not springing for a more quality item.
3,Not Impressed,"This black light is OK. I got it to detect pet urine stains. They do show up, but it has to be pitch black. I've only had it a few weeks and it already flickers like it's going to die any minute. I guess it's worth a few bucks."
1,Useless and fragile,"Bought this to check if my cats were marking outside the litterbox. Here were the problems:~ Rooms needed to be really dark before you could see anything~ It made a funny, humming/buzzing noise~ If it was on more than a few minutes, it smelled like burning plastic~ After using it 4 or 5 times, the bulb stopped working no matter how many times I re-seated it.~ This one, though smaller, works MUCH better:[....]"
1,One of the two already NOT working on day one,"disappointed that on the first day, with limited usage that one of these are not working. The flashlight works so I know the batteries and connection are good.Will return. Hopefully for a new one."
1,poor construction,"I received this item and the box was slightly smashed. That may account for the fact that when I opened the battery door 2 plastic prongs that would hold the door closed broke off. After inserting the batteries, I attempted to closed the door and another prong broke off. This light is very cheaply made. The light did work once I duck tapped the door closed!"
2,"Great for Parties, Not for hunting Scorpions...","We bought this light to help catch scorpions. It doesn't work at all for catching them. We even used it on one we had just killed and still nothing. So if you are in the mood for seeing your teeth look freaky I highly recommend this light, just don't use it for catching those pesky scorpions..."
1,"Very cheaply made, far better alternatives out there",I purchased this blacklight and was sorely disappointed. It is VERY cheaply made... like it was created from a kit by a grade schooler for a science project. The batteries do not fit unless you take it apart and eventually the machine screw you have to pull out to do this will wear the plastic to the point where it doesn't hold any more. The unit I received had to have a wire soldered on to work properly.I found a MUCH nicer unit by Chauvet for the same price. It is equally as powerful and doesn't fall apart.
1,Junk,This is the biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased through Amazon. Never could get the thing to work and battery compartment is a joke. Finally got upset and threw in the trash. Pass on this unless you collect junk.
4,Blacklight,I got this black light because my son has geodes and they glow under a low frequency black light. The frequency is not low enough to make a huge glow effect on the geodes but it still glows some. It is a great black light for parties and just to make your room light up with white items glowing.
3,"Its ok, not terrible but not great","I bought this blacklight as in aid to find scorpions in my backyard. This is an item that is cheaply made overall. The blacklight is not very bright compared to others I have used, and even the on-off button is cheaply made. I only used it several times and got frustrated with the poor quality and eventually bought a nicer, more brighter model, at a local drugstore. I'd recommend against this item."
2,"Usefull, but...","Not as powerful as I would have liked. This light seems moderately durable, easy to turn on and off, but the magnitude of the light is fairly weak and that makes it difficult to use unless you have a blackroom. If you just want a neat-looking baton light, then this is fine, but don't try to use it for any real purpose without eliminating practically all other light sources."
1,No Good,"After receiving it in the mail.I put in brand new batteries turned it on and NOTHING! I am sending it back for a full refund.I had to give it at least one star,otherwise I wouldn't have given it any."
3,Moderate,"I thought this black light was going to be a good buy, but it turned out to not work as well as I thought it would. It's not too bad, though."
1,Dissatisfied customer,Desperately Waited for item to arrive. I needed it so bad for a job. It finally arrived and was broken! So CHEAP.So disappointed!
2,Blacked out Black light,I purchased this blacklight for its small portability. It arrived quickly and well packaged. It just did not work well at all. It sizzled and burned out when the batteries were inserted. I received an unexpected quick refund.
1,Not Impressed,"Only worked 3 minutes, it looked okay out of the box put batteries in turn on th black light it worked turned it off. then I retrieved some bills to check turned it on light came on in less than 2 minutes it literally smoked a little had the burnt component smell all the other items are still working for $7.70 was not worth sending back."
1,Cheaply made. Dont buy.,"Bought two of these. One didnt work when received even though the bulb would glow when placed in the second light. Chose to keep the nonworking as a spare bulb for the one that worked. On first use, the second one smelled of burning plastic within 2 minutes and went out permanently. Didn't bother with return due to cost and chalked up as lesson learned. My opinion - Don't waste your money. Rate them a 0 & Dangerous."
1,Didn't do the job!,I ordered this light to check for pet urine spots so that I could treat them. I turned the light on and saw nothing. I held the light up to a spot that I knew the cats had sprayed and still got nothing! Very disappointed and would NOT recommend to anyone!
2,Limited use,Small limited in use. You get what u paid for which it's limited. Suggest spending more if you need something better.
1,Failed in less than one minute,This item flickered and died less than one minute into its first (and last) use. It emitted a cloud of acrid smoke which was quite impressive for a product powered by AA batteries. I am not making any effort to replace it as after having seen it I really don't want another like it. This is one of the most cheaply made products I've seen.
2,Light worked great when it wasn't smoking!,"We were using the light with the Glo Germ product for a science fair project, it was working really well for about 10 minutes then it started smoking. Ended up just using the little black light that came with the Glo Germs. Really upset I wasted my money on something that didn't work past a few minutes!"
1,What a waste of good money!,"I bought this light to see stains & look for ringworm on my cats.It worked pretty well for a few months, but I didn't use it on a regular basis.The next time I get it out, No Work. I changed batteries(duh)& even spent more money on replacement light tubes. Still not working. Obviously the light itself didn't work & was, of course, out of warranty.I researched & discovered the LED's are beter."
1,so NOT worth buying!,This portable blacklight's bulb is so small and weak and not at all powerful enough for using to spot scorpions here in the desert. Also the battery drawer is EXTREMELY difficult to close after inserting batteries. This item is so NOT worth the price. My advice: Look elsewhere.
3,Over look a few things... and it's good.,"I was surprised by how much light you got out of this thing. It also lasts quite awhile, still running on the first set of batteries over a year later.Do keep in mind, this thing is cheap. Don't expect anything exceptional.It takes 4 AA batteries(not included), and that's where the trouble starts. The problem is when trying to insert them, it's a really tight fit. So tight, in fact, I had to unscrew the top simply to get them in. While this is not a hard feat,(a small fillips dose the trick) you would think this would be an easy task.Second, the cover which fits over the batteries dose not stay on with the batteries inside: Hmm.Although irritating, the problem is easy to fix with some creative use of tape...Other than that, it works at an acceptable level. A bit of DIY fixes the irritating problems, and its asking price is low. So I found it as a worthy purchase.You actually do often get what you pay for."
2,lame yet useful for blacklights,the internet told me blacklights would see germs like on the detective shows but it did not. Cant deide if it was the internet's fault or the product.
3,The hero deserves a medal,"Ok it took me a while to like the heroine in the story she came across as an immature wimp. However there are some parents that are so domineering that no matter how old you are they make your knees knock. The hero Chris, not college educated works with his hands, falls in love with a middle class teacher from a family of teachers. Having lived in her parents footsteps she decides to live her life for herself at 29 years old. She dumps her parents hand picked fiance Andre, quits her parents handpicked job and finds true love and the career of her dreams as a caterer. Nice story but I was more interested in the romance between the secondary characters, hope they have their own book."
5,Great Book,"I just finished this book two days ago and I thought it was a great story. Dana Ellison never went against her parents desires even at the cost of her own....until she met and fell in love with Chris Johnson. Together they discovered what love is and what its like to truly have someone in your corner. Her parents were snobby and flat out refused to see Dana as a woman and not their little girl. I am glad Dana held her own with her parents and in the end she got what she wanted...""A Love of Her Own"" Cheris Hodges is a great writer she always delivers a great story."
4,A Love of Her Own,"Cheris, I thoroughly enjoyed the characters of Dana and Chris. Often, we get caught up in what a man does for a living or what his status is. The development of their relationship was kind of fast for the real world, but I think that Dana was at a point where she wanted to be her own person and just needed someone to encourage her. I was surprised that her mother was the first to come around to Chris, I didn't expect her father to be so opposed to Chris and their relationship. The lack of drama between Chris and Rosalyn and Dana was surprising, but appreciated. I would have liked a little more information on Josh and Zariah, but perhaps that will be in the next book."
5,The number one romance novel ever written.,"This book is a classic and my favorite Anne Stuart novel of all time. I read it in 1985 when it first came out and still reread it today. Anne Stuart's best work. I have never understood why this one has not been re-released. In 1985 no one was talking about child molestation and the tragic consequences for adult women survivors. The side story about Springer's gay father is touching and heartwarming - again, something not seen in 1985. This book will never leave my possession. The book flows well and the characters grow in ways that will leave you forever changed. I still cry when I read this book. If you like happy endings - and don't we all? If you love Anne Stuart, and you really should, get this book. You will not be sorry."
1,Looking before I buy,This is a new product so they don't have a picture. If they did you would realize that it shouldn't be listed under flat panel monitors.
1,"Deceptive lead,","Noting the weights of ""flat-panel"" vs standard monitors with ""flat-screens"", you will notice the ave weight of a flat panel is 12 to 16 pounds...standard monitors with flat screens ave weight is 40 to 65 pounds.This monitor's weight is a dead give-away to being a STANDARD MONITOR with a flat screen weighing in at 50 pounds.Buyer beware! and be AWARE!"
2,VERY SLOW,"This book was a very slow read, the first 13 chapter were slow, and there are only 15 chapter in the whole book. I was very disappointed. I love the plot, but it was very slow and I felt like Luke was playing games with Kate. He was teasing her too much, it took forever to get to the GOOD PART."
5,Trial Mix,This is platium material I mean GB displays some talent I didn't even know who he was I coped the CD I was like dis aint bad. Num 6 put you in the zone dem beats rock and he flows tight he almost is good as me Number 5 is vicious that beat will put you in another world some tracks whack though but if I took out my weed money to buy this ya should 2
5,Good introduction to folk carving.,"This book takes you through traditional folk woodcarving, with an emphasis on sloyd (handcraft) knives and some discussion of axe, adze, and gouge work.The author shows you the tools and how to sharpen them. Then he gets into carving techniques and different kinds of strokes. He discusses in detail control, power and safety. He starts off showing you how to sharpen a pencil, and gets into dough bowls, butter paddles, spoons and ladles. There is a good discussion of how to design spoons so that the strength is maximized by the shape of the spoon and choice of wood.If you are interested in carving boots or ducks, this book is probably not for you. But if the sensuous appeal of a spoon carved from a tree branch appeals to you, you will find it fascinating.Favorite quote: ""A knifeless man is a lifeless man."""
3,Candy with a Bitter Taste!,"Granddady's Candy is a highlight of this CD! The song sounds like it could be referring to child molestion, so this could be the reason this particular song was not a radio hit, which it should have been! The Galaxie 500 remake is also very strong. It's difficult to listen to a Chainsaw Kittens CD and not feel sad, because this band should have been huge. Seeing the band live several times, it is my feeling that substance abuse kept the band from major league success. I wish a band insider would write a biography about the kittens and share his/her thoughts. This CD is a STEAL for the price you will find it on Amazon and it's subcontractors."
2,Yuck.,"This book started with such promise, with the brother in law of a woman, and the woman killing people who had killed her son. And then floating the bodies down a river strapped to wooden crosses just to drive home the point that you don't mess with the Russian mafia. Sadly the rest of the book doesn't live up to the promise and instead wallows through the pages like the protagonist wallows through his self pity."
5,The most poignant and accurate picture of Greece during WWII,"Every Greek of every political inclination must read this magnificently written book.There were times, such as reading the note of an unknown Greek Jew at Auschwitz-Birkinau saying farewell to his parea...and to his beloved fatherland Greece,which brought tears to my eyes.This engrossing book goes a long way in exposing many myths about the war years, including the recent apotheosis of Aris Velouxiotis- the ""legendary"" Kapetanios of the ELAS. He was,in fact, no ""palikari""-but merely a psychotic,power-hungry murderer, no more and no less.I do not say this lightly for I am the son of a former ELAS fighter and this book confirms many of the things my father told me. One thing that it confirms is that we Greeks suffer from the disease of acute disunity.This book examines the consequences. Only in understanding the causes can we find a remedy to this disease which continues to plague us even today.I urge you all to read this book!"
3,Idiosyncratic narrative,"It has long been traditional amongst certain kinds of disconnected intellectual to maintain that the Greek communists were romantic heroes. Much as it is pleasant to create illusions and myths that accord with one's own political prejudices, the slenderest acquaintance with the primary sources makes it completely impossible to believe in this one. We have been unable to conclude otherwise than that, when they were not totally useless, perfidious, and parasitic they were unspeakably barbaric. Now that the cold war is over, there is no longer any vested interest in pretending otherwise. Mr. Mazower's narrative is idiosyncratic and biased.EAM/ELAS was nothing but a carnivorous plant. EAM/ELAS was planted on Greek soil by the Communist party of Greece (KKE) and the Oxbridge types of SOE. EAM/ELAS was fertilized with British gold sovereigns, and was fed with the corpses of the Greek people who systematically, and very often in a barbarous way, its thugs murdered."
2,"Cheap, inaccurate","Well I wasn't expecting much for the low price, but the yellow bars should at least appear to be parallel to each other. They aren't though, most notably the bottom edge of the protractor portion is never parallel to the yellow bar and renders this pretty much useless.The locking mechanism works fine though."
1,Not worth a penny,"This thing is so cheap it's not worth a penny!! In fact, don't even think about buying one - forget it!!"
4,nice for the price,There are better tools out there for this but this is the best Pulley Holding Tool for the money. $ for $ = the best
2,Good for Margaritas?,"This tastes like Roses Lime juice to me. I will pass. Obviously many like it, but the lime to me has that artificial aroma I get from many extracts."
5,Tequila Vinegar,Very limey and a tad sweet. Makes for a good marinade. Its my least favorite of the vinegars from this company but still worth having in the kitchen for the marinade I suggested.
2,They stink...literally!,"Everything about these washcloths is great, except the smell! They stink, Huggies should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such a stinky product, don't all mothers want their babies to smell sweet?! Well with these, your babies will smell like plastic! The Johnson and Johnson brand smell better, but the actual washcloth isn't the greatest, Huggies smell horrible but the actual washcloth is better than J&J."
1,Not for finnicky watchers,"I checked this out of the ""family"" section of our local video store, but wish that I had not. The acting is pretty bad, so much so that I wondered if they were trying to make a good movie or make a movie so bad that it becomes laughable. One has the sense that the budget was very tight and each scene could only have one take. Costumes are similarly odd--the girl wears the same red/yellow spandex attire during nearly the entire movie.I watched this movie with my 3-year old son. He found it entertaining, but I cringed repeatedly and said to myself, ""I wish he had not just seen that scene"" or ""I hope he doesn't start talking like that.""The best way to watch this movie is to get a group of film critics together and mock it mercilessly. It could be fun to watch in that context."
5,Highly Recommended!,"If you are into tropical architecture, this sure is the book for you! Not much text which makes it of ""worth"" + great photography! Before planning a house, this sure is a must-have! Houses featured here has its owne individuality and character! Dont miss it!..."
5,beautiful photography,Got this book for a friend and had trouble giving it away. It is well photographed and the homes are beautiful. If you enjoy looking at beautiful homes get this book and dream away!
1,Great pictures but the title is misleading and pictures are hadr to follow when reading the text,"I just bought a copy of this book. The pictures are great. I have the following problems with the book 1) The title is sly and deceiving. The bolded letters say ""Tropical Living"", and the rest of the title are in smaller letters. I bought the book thinking the featured homes are architectural entities uniquely tropical. They were not. Instead, the book is a hodgepodge of pretty homes artificially grouped through some whimsy of the author. 2) The pictures are hard to follow when you read the text. My advice, save your money and get yourself a subscription to a home design magazine. You will be better off."
4,The Loin And The Lamb,"This CD is a good over view of a man who has been a major influence on Duke Ellington as well As Fats Waller. The tunes are very easy to listen to, and are compariable to either; Eubie Blake, or James P. Johnson. A excellent choice to anyone who's begining a Early Jazz Collection!"
2,Best sound for $$$; worst reliability,"These monitors have excellent sound. I doubt you'll ever hear a complaint about them on that score. There are none even close to as good for the money.They are, however, one of the most unreliable monitors on the market. Capacitors burn out and power supplies stop working. Many, many complaints of this kind found on the web, with entire websites devoted to fixing them.A poor design. Avoid."
3,Best Sound for the Price,"I listened to a lot of monitors before landing on these. They sound great, and the price was right.Having written that, they are not the most reliable speakers out there. You might want to buy a warranty, or buy from a near-by 'bricks and mortar' vendor. I returned two sets to Alesis under the manufacturer's warranty. Both sets failed during 'burn in'. However, my current third set has worked reliably now for more than a year."
1,save your money...or invest in gold instead!,"Capt. Freaky thought this ""might"" be a great premise for a feature film....what I should have trusted was my own knowledge that any film reagarding subject manner of this nature couldn't be made well in 2006! This film sucked from beginning to end. There were no interesting story lines, no outrageous torture footage, no tense sexual scenes, it was as boring as a special on A&E.;The picture and sound quality were the worst I've seen in years, in any medium. The acting was pretty good...considering there wasn't much to do. I wasn't scared of these bunch of hillbilly serial killers...the women they picked were not particularly interesting.What can I say? This film is a total waste of money...I should have bought gold coins instead. In ten years they'll be worth money, while this DVD is worth about $3 at my local video store's used pile!"
3,A Squadron of the United States Navy: On a Friendly Cruise Around Latin America,"This is a book written by an apparent Naval Reservist who participated in a six month cruise. It is written in the style of lay military journalists in the period 1898-1913. The content of the information varies and the material is a sort of travelogue. Some interesting and historic photographs are included in the book along with some table of the officers of the United States Navy accurate through approximately 1917-1918. One of the persons mentioned in the book is a Commander Z. E. Brooks who eventually received a promotion to Captain and was one of the Commanding Officers of ""USS America,"" a commandeered German luxury liner which became a Navy troop transport ship during WW I and later became a USAT ship. Briggs eventually was a Commanding Officer of the Philippine Division"
2,HP Pavilion ZT1135,"I had this laptop for about 30 months. I added 512MB of memory and after 12 months or so the hard drive would not boot so I took out the additional memory and it worked fine for another 3 months. Then the hard drive starting acting up, clicking and sputtering along. Eventually the hard drive just gave up and I could not boot up the OS. I also had problems with the screen flickering. There must have been a bad connection between the lid (screen) and the main body of the laptop. I had to move the screen slightly and the picture would appear, but then it would go blank on its own. I must admit I used this machine very hard. I took it on business trips and used it every day to do on-line college courses. I was hoping for a longer life than 30 months."
5,What a great gift!,"I just got this for mother's day and I LOVE it!! It's very light, which is great because I am going to do a lot of traveling soon. It was very easy to register my XP with the help of ""Victor"", the virtual 3D HP assistant. It comes with so many accessories. Everything has simple, step-by-step instructions to help you through them. The pentium processor is very fast. It doesn't overheat as easily as my husband's laptop. I was surprised to see that I can use my digital camera with it. Not to mention my digital recorder! I really enjoy this computer."
2,JUNK ZT1135,"Can not get HP to help me with parts, battery short lived, sent back to HP they fixed nothing. Will never buy from them or Best Buy"
5,Perfect replacement,This switch was a replacement purchased for an older ceiling fan that requires a two tier switch with 6 wires. All the newer fans use a one tier switch with 4 wires so thats all that was availible locally.
1,Westinghouse 77075,This product was junk. The springs to hold the wire in were missing inside. Would not hold the wires at all. Do not buy these. I was sold a defective product!
5,The Gift of Oneself,"I have only started reading the book, but it has given me much food for thought and opened my eyes to new avenues of loving God and changing my life for the better."
5,Following God's Will,"You are serious about having a personal relationship with God, this guide will help you to get there by learning how to find peace in every situation. One you will read and reread."
2,Swiss Gear Pissaro Messenger Bag,"I had submitted a favorable review earlier, mostly because the bag seemed to be well-constructed and had two mesh side pockets. Then, two weeks after I started using the bag, the handle ripped. I don't carry a heavy load, so I didn't expect the bag to start falling apart so quickly. Guess I'll go back to using a backpack."
2,"Bag is a little cheap, but good size","I didn't realize you can buy this brand from Target. First off, the color is black and greenish/grey. It's not bad looking but the material seems a bit on the flimsy side. But I did get it for $16 and free shipping. All pockets are zippered except for the back pocket which is velco (1 inch piece). The shoulder strap is strange. It's 2 pads velcroed together. Not the nicest bag, but one you won't mind using for a little while. I'm debating whether or not to take it to Europe. I do like the size. Sometimes the square shaped messenger bags are uncomfortable and too deep. The dimensions were what I was looking for. It's a good medium sized bag and thin. It won't hold bulky objects."
2,"Weak code examples, VB",I keep stressing the fact that I have not seen a single intelligently written Visual Basic (.NET) source code. This book is not an exception. The code segments are plain sloppy and don't cover enough features of Visual Studio .NET 2003Better luck with C# in the next edition.
1,The worst!,"Without a doubt, the worst ""walkman"" I have ever purchased. I bought the item on a Friday evening, went for one run on Saturday, and returned it within 24 hours!!!! I found the volume control was placed in a horrible spot, the headphone jack continuously pulled out of the player, and the armband was poorly designed, allowing the radio to keep sliding down. Almost every piece of electronics I own is Sony, but this does not live up to its namesakeI went out a purchased a Philips PSA (the nike one), and it is unbelievable, the right size, the armband is tight, and the volume control is not in the way...."
4,Nicely designed multiband radio,"I particularly wanted a radio that received TV sound, plus FM/AM. This receiver does all that plus a weather band. The design is convenient for exercising since you can wear it either on your belt or on your arm. Sound quality is excellent on FM with a nice bass boost. AM reception is average. Headphones are adequate but not superlative. Lack of automatic tuning is a negative so finding stations that are not on your presets are time consuming. It seems to be tough since I have banged it into the door frame several times while it was on my arm and dropped it a couple of times without any scratches."
2,Headphone Connection,"I have had the same headphone-connection issues as other users have stated here. I was about to buy another Sony, thinking the problem was a fluke, but after reading of other users having the same issue, I think I will pass on this Sony product. In fact, I think I will return mine to the store I purchased it and demand a refund, printing off the reviews from this site. I generally like the product, but had already decided to reinforce the headphone connection when I purchased a new one. Now, however, I will not be purchasing a new Sony, and will find another arm band radio for my workouts. It was ok while it lasted, but should have lasted much longer. I'm disappointed in the product, but happy with the armband concept. Avoid this product unless you are buying for a 3 month usage period."
1,Lousy,"I agree with all other reviewers who hate this radio. I get passable reception running west along the Charles River in Boston. However, turning around and running the same path home, I get lousy reception, static, station override and every other unpleasantness. I used to have a yellow Radio Shack model that was perfect, but no others I have tried since measure up--and this is advanced technology?"
2,Overpriced and mediocre,"...This radio not only is designed half-handedly, its ergonomics are faulty - especially using a round switch for the volume - which does not lock - and the quality in general is mediocre.Reception is ok at best, and noisy normally. The Weather Band barely manages to receive any signal and the TV band gets only 13 channels, instead of scanning.Before I bought this radio I thought Sony may have something special; with this cheaply made, high priced radio, I am certain it is gone. They are just like any other company."
1,"i got 3, all broke within 1 year","I got one for myself and two other ones for friends. Initially it worked great, but after about 9 months all got the same problem: the headset no longer connected well to the radio and hence it stopped working (lots of noise). This is definitely a flaw in the design and I do not recommend anyone buying this product."
1,Fatal Flaw!,"The headphone connection becomes loose on this radio with normal use, leading to in-and-out audio reception. Maddening! It happened on the first one I bought, but I bought another thinking it was a one-time flaw. Not so. It happened on the second one too. Don't waste your money. It's junk."
3,somewhat disappointed,"I purchased this basically to use while working out at the gym. It's the only one I know of that has an armband so it doesn't get in your way and is very secure. However I got very poor reception for 2 of my favorite radio stations. They barely came in and there was just too much static no matter which floor I was on. However Circuit City has a very generous 30 day return policy so I'm going to try it several more times. On the plus side, the stations that do come in sound great. They're just not my favorites."
1,waste of money!!!,i bought 2 within an 8 month span - each one lasting no more than 3 months. i think it's mostly the headphone connection. but this is crap! DO NOT BUY! it's not worth the money.
2,"Don't waste your money, your wallet will thank you...","The product has plenty to offer, TV/AM/FM tuner, weather stations, plenty of presets, etc. I was turned off by the product a few weeks after purchasing it. The volume control is by far the biggest dissapointment. If it is clipped to your belt, bending over or any such movements will cause the belt to turn the volume knob accidentally as the knob is horribly placed on the inner part of the radio, closest to the body. There is an audible hiss even at it's lowest setting. Fine adjustment of the volume to your exact liking is a lesson in frustration most times. At a low setting which I usually like, the sound only comes out of the right earpiece. Unfortunately, I never got around to returning the product and I suffer with it on a daily basis waiting for it to break so I can get a better one. Avoid this product like the plague!!"
1,Headphone jack becomes loose,"I too bought one and had the headphone jack become loose. I bought another thinking I had a faulty one, but now I'm having the same issue with this one. The loose jack causes the reception to go in and out...and finally just out completely. I agreed with the previous opinions on this fatal flaw."
3,ok - not great,"This radio has decent reception, which is what I wanted in a small portable radio. I wish it were smaller. It is incomprehensible to me why Sony would provide such poor quality headphones with its radio. Presumably Sony would know how to make good headphones. When I replaced them with my Earhugger headphones, the sound quality improved tremendously as did the comfort. The volume control knob is poorly positioned and often moves with normal arm movement. Before I turn the radio on, I always turn the volume to its lowest level, so as not to be blasted by inadvertent change in the volume control level."
5,its da bomb,"i love it has good sound the stations are mostly all clear and you get a good buy i think!!i would recomend this to anyone who walks alot and always is worried about breaking it because this one does not break. it (for me) has lasted a long time,so far.i also think it looks real awsome and so do my friends!!"
4,Great Product,"I find this to be quite a nice product. It appears kind of large at first glance, but sits securely on the arm and is light and not bothersome. Reception is very good and importantly for me, the volume is LOUD(nice when so many walkmans are quiet for safety?). The headphone connection is a bit crackly. I hope this radio last a while."
2,Still Cannot Get the Connection Right,"This is the third iteration I have purchased. Each time the headset connection gets worse and makes it all but unusable. I don't mind paying a premium price for a radio, but at least I would like one that worked."
1,Too unreliable to use,I would like a reliable radio to carry along when I walk. My husband bought me a Sony SRF-M80V S2 Sports Radio Walkman and it is a piece of junk. I can't get it to stay on. I cannot enjoy using it because it is too undependable. In fact it makes me angry. I thought Sony was a good company but this product is worthless.Is anyone making reliable radios now? I prefer to pay less than $50 but might pay more if I knew I was getting a good product. It saddens me that reliability and customer service seem to be increasingly rare.
1,Garbage,"This radio has a lot of nice features, but is not built very strong. The belt clip broke off on my unit, and now the head phone jack is going. I expect a radio that is supposed to be used while exercising to be durable. I need a new radio now (less than 1 year), and I am not going to buy another Sony SRF-M80V."
1,Poor Reception /Volume knob broken in days,"I had the prior Sony model and it was just ok but I liked the armband.This one has worse reception than the old. But worse yet, it is made such that if you snag the radio on something the volume control knob easily breaks off. Don't waste your money. I am now looking for a regular small radio that I can out in a pouch while exercising."
2,Poor reception,Mine has been dependable enough so far but the reception is very bad as noted by other users. I purchase this radio to replace a very old tape/radio combination unit. The reception on this unit is much worse relative to that of the 10 year old el-cheapo unit.
3,Didn't recieve arm band,Didn't receive the armband. Otherwise a good basic walk-man. I've purchased this item several times over the years to use at the gym. Armband is the only reason I need to replace the radio. They go bad easily.
2,Worked for 1 year,"This product died after 1 year of use. The armband needed to be replaced a few months earlier, but I couldn't find one online or at stores.Programming is not intuitive. I would not buy one again."
3,Decent...Needs Some Improvements,"I like the channel preset buttons and the stop watch feature but...I do not like the volume control. It is very sensitive and easily moved if you put the radio in a pocket or attach to your belt. I can't tell you how many times I have blasted my eardrums or turned the volume off while running. Something also went bad with the left channel, it cuts in and out, which is very annoying. Overall it's not a bad radio...Reception and sound are pretty good. I would not buy again unless the volume control was improved."
3,Not What I Had Hoped For,"Although I would never use headphones while running anywhere other than the gym for safety reasons, I agree that this unit is very difficult to change channels and volume while running at a fairly quick pace. Even at a slow run it takes some considerable fiddling to program. I thought this would be less cumbersome than a traditional portable cd player but it looks like I will be forking over the cash to purchase one for my winter treadmill runs!"
2,Good Features but poor reception,"I bought this radio to use at the gym. That was a big mistake because it doesn't work at the gym. The reception is so poor that any ...radio will beat it.so if plan to use it outside is a good choice, but not at the gymI just returned it to the store and got another one for half the price, and it work fine at the gym."
2,"Poor Reception, Static and Hiss","Purchased for use while jogging as a replacement to an SRF-m70 after 4 years of use. Reception was terrible. All AM and FM stations had background static and hiss. Local/Distance button seemed to have no effect. I live in the DFW area so it is not like distance to the transmitters were an issue.Also did not like the way the controls were shown ""upside down"", presumably for when the unit is used with the arm band (I used the belt clip)."
1,Horrible design,This walkman is at best highly annoying and at worst very dangerous to your ears. For some reason they decided to place the volume dial directly behind the clip and the lock mechanism does not lock the volume. The result is blasted out ears any time you try to clip the walkman on something or keep it in your pocket.A terrible design flaw - avoid this product if you value your ears.
3,jogging,"I was expecting a little more of this radio. I like the lock feature but I wished it also locked the volume. My old Sony had the AVLS (I believe) that you could not accidentally increase the volume while jogging. Sometimes the radio does not work inside the gym. I like having the armband, and I like the size. (Significantly smaller than my old one)"
1,"Hiss, Static and a little bit of Music on the side","To be absolutely fair about this, I live in an area of ""fringe"" reception as far as radio stations go. I forked over about $50. thinking that the digital tuning on this unit would improve the fading and volume loss that I encountered with the cheap radios I was using while running. The first SRF-M80V that I tried would only get one station and even then, the noise:signal ratio was unacceptable. Thinking it was defective, I returned it for another one which worked slightly better, but still had unacceptable reception. The antenna is apparently in the headphone cord and the bouncing around while running does bad things for the sound quality. If you're in a metropolitan area, it might work for you, but stay away if you are rural/suburban."
4,Good but not durable,"I have to agree with the reviewer who complained about the headset jack. Although this seems to be the common flaw in all walkman-types I've owned, I was dissapointed that Sony hadn't improved the contacts problem.My stereo went to mono after 1 year + 1 day (oops, no more warranty coverage!), and then the jack failed totally a month later. For a radio supposedly targeted to runners/athletes, it's not very durable.I also agree that the provided headphones have a cord that is too short, the volume control can be a problem, and the ease of accidental channel change is too much.But the arm-band is great. Although the velcro connectors were beginning to lose their effectivess at the 1 year mark as well."
4,Works fine for me...,"I really enjoy using my armband radio. It has worked well for me even on my almost daily three mile runs. It still works even after I got caught in a downpour and got drenched. The earphone cord is a bit long, though. It is hard to find a place for it where it will not be in the way or uncomfortable. Other than that, this is the best product that I have found for myself."
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!,"I don't usually complain about a gift, especially a Sony, but this product warranted it.The stations don't come in clearly and/or consistently. The FM antenna seems to be in the headphone jack, so should you move the station will either fade out or become static-y. The volume control is right near the belt clip so that it is constantly, accidentally being turned up, or turned down. And you can't put some sort of a hold on the volume.The seek doesn't go to to stations that are clear, so you're constantly pressing it down seeking stations manually, which makes walking or jogging hard.This product is not worth the trouble and just stressed me out."
3,Good radio with flaws,"I bought this to replace my previous Sony sports walkman radio. This radio has several deficiencies compared to the old Sony design.1. The WB (weather band) button looks exactly like the other radio presets. But if you press it, sorry, you're in a new ""mode"" and you can't get back to your other preset stations without some effort. I would much rather have a sixth preset button.2. The battery case frequently snaps ajar. The batteries then come loose and I lose all presets.3. The volume wheel is right next to my arm when I'm using the radio, so I frequently am adjusting the volume inadvertently.I would really like Sony to redesign this product to make it more useful."
3,Plug Problems,"I liked my 2 SRF-M80V walkmans (After replacing 1). The problem with this walkman is the internal contacts that meet the headphone plugs become loose and the audio is intermitant. You contact Sony and the service is lets say weak. No extra effort to make-do on a problem that I have had with 2 of these radios.Guess what the service fee after a year is ahhhhhh $45.00. Guess how much a new radio is $49.00. ""gee, great"". No more.I am a Sony fan and I loved this radio while it worked for a year or so. The exterior has held up well but, not the interior engineering."
4,Works fine / Funciona Bien,"Litle bit slow, but works perfectly fine for me (until now)Good build. I recomended. The only const I think kingston must have some way to attach the cap.Un poco lento, pero funciona perfectamente para mi. (hasta ahora)Buena manufactura. Lo recomiendo. Lo unico negaivo es que kingston debe conseguir una manere de mantener unida la tapa."
4,Very Handy,"Since buying this flash drive I have found more uses for it than I thought I would. It connects with ease to every computer I have tried it on including a couple with windows me, so far windows has loaded software for it and read off it without a problem. Highly recomend this drive for ease of use,cost and value"
1,Too heavy,"This tv is too heavy, if you want to buy one make sure ask for help when you lift it, otherwise you could hurt your back."
5,"Review of ""Re-Alliance"", by the Bluegrass Alliance","This CD is chock full of masterful performancesby Barry Palmer, one of the best banjo pickersalive, Chuck Nation, a consumate fiddler, andTom Hicks, superb on mandolin. The vocal harmoniesare smooth. The selection of songs is not typicalbluegrass fare, in keeping with a long traditionof this band. The lead vocals by bass playerLaRita Buchanan are clear as the North Georgiamountain air. The track ""Friend of the Devil""is especially fine....the fiddle & banjo breaks are simply not to be believed!Band leader John Martin does a superb job on lead vocals.If you are buyingone Blugrass CD this year, make it this one."
4,A Marvelous Solo Acoustic Guitar Talent,"So much music, so little time (and money to spend on it!), but when I read a blurb in a recent issue of Goldmine that Leo Kottke was a big fan of Tim Sparks I needed no further introduction. I immediately ordered this CD. I was not disappointed.This all-instrumental and mostly solo acoustic recording (Dean Magraw provides second guitar on ""Eu So Quero Em Xodo"") serves up 11 Sparks' originals (the duet is the only non-original tune). Sparks incorporates a number of influences in his fingerpicking: country blues (""Mr. Marques""), Brazilian (""Pata Negra""), Italian (""A Lucky Hand"") and Turkish (""Athe Amsterdam Cakewalk"").Sparks' fingerstyle playing is relaxing and introspective without resorting to new age noodling. If you like artists like William Ackerman, Alex de Grassi, Leo Kottke or Adrian Legg, Tim Sparks is a guitarist worth checking out RECOMMENDED"
4,Great modal & scale work.,"I suppose im a bit similar to the reviewer below, as I study finger-style guitar and also have a love for solo guitar, however Im a HUGE fan of Alex De Grassi and the new age artists. For me, it offers new, contemporary ground, tunings and approaches. John Fahey??? I know hes bigger then ""God"" and all, but give me a break, where's the technique, its amazing how big Fahey is with such little to offer technically.In any case, Tim Spark's album is great! He is so technically solid and his choice of modal tonality and scales gives the listener some new flavors for the ear.This is a GREAT player and a superb CD!"
1,This CD is awful,"This CD is just awful. First of all the music doesn't fit at all with Beanie Babies, nor do any of the songs fit with their whimsical, child like titles. This is just BAD new age music hyped to sell with a BEANIE logo on it. You would at least expect songs titled ""Don't Worry, Get Happy, or Hoot, Hoot, Hooray"" to be a little bit up beat. Don't count on it. The songs don't fit the titles and they are definitely NOT child's music. Don't waste your money. Bad, Bad, Bad!!!!"
4,Great NewAge music,"I heard my kids playing this CD in their room and had to listen to it myself. It's more ""adult"" NewAge than kids music. I really enjoyed the album - I just wish that the title was different. After all,who is going to pull out ""My Beanie Music Collection"" in the office in front of all the guys or gals?"
3,A mixed bag,"Gendy3 is 18+ minutes of synthesized sound. It was ""written"" by a program called GENDYN, which Xenakis wrote (in BASIC!) as part of his research into algorithmic composition. The result has eleven sections, each 1-2 minutes long, each pretty much a single texture which doesn't evolve in any particular way. The sequence of the eleven sections seems arbitrary. If you like the sound clip on this page, you'll probably like listening to the piece, if not, it may make you run from the room.I find Tauriphanie a more interesting listen. It also uses computer-generated sounds, but this time inspired by the sounds of bulls.This disc is currently the only way to hear these two pieces.As and Thallen are fine works, but there's a newer and much stronger performance of As on Timpani."
4,Not the highest quality HDMI cable but what do you expect for <$30.00,I received my HDMI cable within 5 days from purchasing online. I didn't expect the best or top of the line cable for $3.00 however it does the job. Now if only we can get higher quality cables for that price life would be great. The only problem I have had with the cable is the HDMI side of the cable is a little loose but how often do you move the cable once you have it in place.
3,Small Craft Review,"Good - Extremely complete on building small crafts with plank style construction. The author knows this art extremely well, and has taken a lot of time to commit his knowledge to paper.Bad - The book is written from in the ""grumpy old sailor"" tone. Comments about ""A man used to know how to use a tape measure"" will be found, and are probably a fair statement for the authors geography. However, it can be a bit distracting."
2,Caution-- Not your typical Richard Scarry,"If you have a pre-schooler who loves Richard Scarry, STOP. Do NOT buy this book. This may be a great explanation for older kids (as the previous reviewer said), but I got it for a young 5 year old who loves Richard Scarry and was very disappointed with it. We love the Richard Scarry of Busy Busy World and Cars, Trucks and Things that Go. This kiddo is not ready for ""some mean white people enslaved the Native Americans"" and ""Indians died. Pilgrims died. Everyone died."" (obviously, these are paraphrases, but my point is, this is a heavy load of reality when my child was expecting Lowly in his apple car and Dingo the Dog.)I think the children who are likely to see this book and pick it up are probably not old enough for it, and those who are old enough probably would not pick it up."
5,Wonderful!,"Usually, at any given time, a flutist is practicing a solo work, technical exercises, ensemble work, and an etude. When I began playing contemporary repertoire about a year ago, I was introduced to Robert Dick. He (literally) wrote the book on extended techniques and his ""Flying Lessons: Six Contemporary Etudes"" remains a staple of anyone playing contemporary music. I bought Flying Lessons a year ago, and continue to play them to help hone my extended technique and train my ear to hear multiphonics as I am playing them. This CD helped enormously when it came to starting a new etude, and even though I now know what they sound like, I still listen to the CD because I enjoy it. I recommend this CD to anyone playing Flying Lessons or anyone who wants to experience one of the most influential contemporary composers celebrated works.~DD"
5,"Relevant, current and readable.","This book covers all aspects of today's frame relay: history, functionality, deployment, management, internetworking with TCP/IP, ATM, SNA, voice and other frame relay networks and regulatory constraints. It starts with an excellent introduction that will get most people up to speed. All topics are covered in a knowledgeable, readable and sometimes amusing style."
5,Relevance is the key word,Relevance is the key word. I love the Coffee Cup Bible Study series. This series is written for women by a woman of wit and graciousness who has an impressive command of hermeneutics.I couldn't wait to get started with Mocha on the Mount. I've been to the place called the Mount of Beatitudes and felt as if I were back there again as the scripture unfolded.Ms. Glahn draws us into history and expands our view as she weaves other scripture and stories into the picture. We can see God's same message in other lives and other settings. She is especially effective at expounding on the Greek and Hebrew words that bring color and relevance to the lessons.It is so helpful to have the Biblical text printed in the study. I always have it with me.
5,Made a great gift!,"I bought this book along with another (Book of Old Silver by Wyler) for my mom. She was been collecting old silver pieces at antique shows/flea markets etc (getting some incredible deals) buut didn't know all the hallmarks or history. She LOVES this book. Every hallmark that you could imagine is listed in here. At first its a little difficult to navigate but once you figure out how its set up you're on your way - you can determine the year it was made, the county etc. There is also pricing information in terms but what I liked is that it indicates if the piece/pattern is rare, common etc, too. Terrific book. She raves about it and I've had fun looking up some of my pieces too, finding out that they're 100 yrs old is fun! Excellent reference book!"
4,A good tool to use to identify a pattern...,"This is a very useful book. It's not fabulous, but very helpful, especially when trying to identify a particular pattern. The bulk of the book is made up of line drawings of the handle of the spoon in a particular pattern, showing only one side (front) and no detail of the bowl. That being said, the drawings are very detailed and allow for good identification of a piece. The patterns are sorted by manufacturer, and give dates as well as pattern names. There is also a code which designated whether the pattern is older or newer, popular or not sought after, and whether it is handwrought.At the end there is a two page diagram of marks, (wish it were larger), as well as an extensive index. All in all this book is worth the price, and if you need to identify a piece, don't hesitate to buy it."
2,Limited and Hard to use,"Of course, I'm just a beginning silver collector, but I spent hours trying to find matches in this book to the many pieces I have (50+). I was only able to find one match. I did not find this book helpful. Instead, you should go to Silverwarehouse.com and use their FREE identification service or buy ""Silverplate Flatware"" by Tere Hagan, as was recommended to me."
4,comprehensive pattern compilation/hallmarks lack,"Maybe if there was some way to put all of these people in one room and force them to print one reference book for sterling flatware, then MAYBE, just MAYBE, it wouild finally be complete. While this reference is comprehensive with its coverage of patterns and companies, its hallmark references for getting to that comopany are lackluster, but aA for effort!"
5,Sterling Flatware Identification & Value Guide,"This has become my bible for identifying sterling flatware. Of course, it has the most popular patterns, and obscure patterns may not be found; but generally, it is a great resource for collectors or those who sell flatware on auction sites. I keep it right by the computer, and use it almost on a daily basis. I have recommended it several times to those who don't know how to ID what they have. I don't know what I would do without it."
4,identificationof silverware good,"For a beginner and colector of silver this is useful. It does not do alot for the antique colector, but is an another addition to a collectors library."
2,Xerox Toner Cartidge,"Laser printer cartridges should never cost this much!Although this price is much better than the [$] average, thecost is alot more than you would pay to just buy another printer.Sad when it is easier to throw away a printer cause it is cheaperto buy a new one than to get supplies for it.Tim J."
3,"Includes the AOR hit ""I COULD BE GOOD FOR YOU""","FIRST TWO ALBUMS ON ONE CD.***The lead track, ""I Could Be Good For You"", seemed like a staple of AOR radio stations back in the early 80s - for some reason though, the cut didn't really make the jump to the classic rock format - and has become a little forgotten with time. ""I Could Be Good For You"" has kind of a Bad Company feel, with a little more polish. Honestly, I find the rest of the disc a little bland - but this one track is a killer, and worth the price of admission. 707 recorded another very memorable song, the title track from their third album Megaforce.FYI - AOR stands for Album Oriented Rock, a very successful FM radio format in the late 70s and early 80s. ...Post disco, but pre Madonna. Quite a lot of these stations evolved into Classic Rock stations as AOR died out in the late 80s and early 90s. 707 is one of the many bands that thrived in the AOR era, but were excluded from most classic rock programming."
3,Okay--but a bit forgettable,"It is amazing to me that Agatha Christie wrote stories with HAPPY endings!!! I was thinking this set would have traditional ""who done it"", but it really didn't. The stories were mostly quite sweet for the most part, and the acting was good, but once you finished watching it, it was easily forgotten. I would recommend it only if you want to see the original plan of character for ""Miss Lemon"" (interesting!) and want to see another, kinder side of A. Christie."
5,Agatha No. 1 Sleuth,This is a great movie and a wonderful buy.It is an Agatha Christie Masterpiece. It fits right in with the rest of this wonderful movie adaptation of her brilliant mysteries.
3,agatha christie hour,Thought that there would be more of John Nettles in the set. These were like stage plays. Good but not great.
3,Agatha Christie Hour set 1,"I found the series of disks, more like stage plays rather than actual movies.The settings seemed too staged.Although the plots were good in most cases, they lacked the real Agatha Christie stlye I have got use to.But they were certainly better entertainment that what is appearing on the television.You could tell these stories were not her best... but they are good value for money."
3,Okay,This set contains some of the less well-known Agatha Christie stories. Of interest to Agatha Christie fans who already have all the Poirot and Miss Marple DVDs.
1,a big let down,"I was really looking forward to this 'new' collection but was sadly let down when I viewed the stories. The plots are weak but could have been made a lot more interesting had the directing, acting, and settings been far more entertaining. As it was, the acting was quite awful, not convincing at all, and the settings were really not much more than cliches. Too bad. I suggest anyone who is interested in Agatha Christie's works read the books first and then move on the to the Miss Marple series and the Poirot series.Murder, That's What"
1,lacking content,These may have been presented on television in Great Britain but they lack substance. There isn't any mystery. The Agatha Christie name lured me into purchasing this set but it isn't worth it (and I won't be purchasing any future sets). Buy the Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple but not these.
2,Not the Christie I expected.,"I really didn't like this set, I didn't like the stories it it and I am donating it to charity."
3,No mysteries here,"These stories were not Agatha Christie murder mysteries as I had hoped. They try to be psychological thrillers but come up very short of being thrilling. There are no murders and only weak mysteries if any. But if you set aside any ""Agatha Christie"" expectations, the programs are mildly enjoyable if only because they are so different from anything else you are likely to have seen on television. Still, I would be surprised if many people who view set one would ever buy set two."
1,$5 each for a blind item? Oh come on!,You can get blind item comics in good condition for $0.25 each from some other dealers.
2,Could have been better,"In this movie, a trio of young people build an independent burger stand on the outskirts of a college campus in direct opposition to an evil burger baron (played by Jim Varney), who wants their space. The burger stand doesn't get very much business until one of the managers decides to try adding an experimental aphrodisiac to the special sauce.The plot actually isn't that bad-it has great potential for some laughs. Unfortunately, the script is terrible, so bad in fact, that you can actually see some of the characters cringe as they say their lines. Some of the acting is pretty good, despite the script. Varney fans get to see him as a bad guy for a change. Some of the funniest scenes show Varney as the burger baron on the set shooting ads for his burgers, where Varney shows another perspective on all those ads that he made himself. Unfortunately, there isn't enough Varney footage in this flick to save the film."
5,Trinere's back with more great freestyle,"Trinere is the shining gem of freestyle from FL with the amazing beautiful voice and the booming beats from Jampacked/Pandisc. Her first album is a classic - perhaps the very best freestyle album out there - hard to surpass although this album has some strong contender tracks. This, her 3rd studio album (but her 2nd freestyle album - her 2nd album was too R&Bish to count) contains more great dance tracks. Freestyle highlights are Alone at Last, I Want you to want me & Rockin to the Rhythm. There are also some decent non freestyle dance tracks and ballads. All in all, the quality is still higher than most of the other freestyle albums out there, although her debut album is in a class by itself. Her label has put out numerous compilations of her material but long overdue is a collection of any unreleased remixes & new material, her 12"" mixes and the hard to find 'It's the Music'. bring on more big beats!!!"
4,"excellent as usual, but...","Lúnasa made the best sound ever heard in celtic music, but in some way I find this new work a bit routine."
5,Another Great Case From Enlight!,"I have used Enlight cases for years, and this is the latest edition of the Mid Tower series. You can fit nearly any motherboard in this case, it has room to add 3 extra fans, front panel USB, and rail-less 5.25 drive bays with a simple slip-in and click-to-lock design.I currently have 4 of these cases in use - highly recommended!"
4,Informational. Maybe too much so.,I got three fourths of the way through this book. I decided at this point that I would learn little more than I already had so put it away..
5,Fan Pull Chain,"Each came in it's own little box,it was easy to take links off to get the length you want and the design at the end was just what was wanted as it matched the little end to my blinds.Easy to install and it looks good and easy to pull. It does not break even if you pull hard."
5,Terrific & Inspiring!,"I'm an absolute beginner, full of expectations and fears. Before ordering this tape, I had never attempted to try monotype printmaking. I was quite impressed by what I was able to create, using the methods demonstrated. It is such a terrific tape! Inspiring and very ""walk you through it just enough,"" that you will want to get started.While watching, I thought to myself, ""Wow, this has got to be the most enjoyable form of creating imagery!"" The tape is well thought out and the demonstrations are clearly explained. No prior knowledge of art or printmaking is presumed. The lessons make great use of step-by-step examples to demonstrate water-base monotype techniques and help the viewer reproduce those techniques. Excellent for beginners. Very down to earth and to the point. You can't go wrong with this one!"
4,I love it!,THe colors are stylin. I love the preset stations with the tv and weather band. It is everything I could ask for. Plus the ear phones. So awesome. You should buy one to.
3,required for supreme court class,i dont know what to write here. it was a required for a class i took. sold it back soon as class was over.
2,Coughs and all,"Being a Clara Haskil fan, I looked forward to hearing this highly acclaimed duo, but the quality of the recording is awful. It was recorded in concert, and the applause after each piece is also included. A persistent cougher during Beethoven's G Major sonata just won't leave the hall and go back home to bed. This can't compare with Isaac Stern's brilliance (Sony) in the same pieces."
1,Hideously bad,"Although I remember enjoying other Edgar Eager books when I was younger, I was horrified upon rereading this one! Not only is the writing hideously predictable and plodding, the plot is filled with unbearable whiteness; for example, the children at one point find themselves on an island of cannibals who chanted, ""Wah! Samoa! Goona goona!"" Unbelievable."
5,Time and Time Again,"Edward Eager continues to entertain decades after his death through his books about ordinary children who experience magic. THE TIME GARDEN was always one of my favorites (oh, okay, I admit it - I like all of Edward Eager's books and can't really pick a favorite). Roger, Ann, Eliza, and Jack encounter time traveling at its finest when they are exiled to spend the summer with old Mrs. Whiton. An interesting note, their mothers were two of the children in HALF MAGIC and MAGIC BY THE LAKE also by Eager. A bank of wild thyme in the garden opens doors to the past, present and future for these four delightful children. If it's imagination you are looking for, look no further. Edward Eager's books are witty and wild and funny. There is a certain degree of sophistication in his style of writing that makes these stories interesting even for the mature reader."
5,brain eaters--all the rage,"I picked this book up in an airport years ago and was surprised by how good it was (hadn't read any Brandner at that point). Would recommend it to anyone.Think The Stand came first, but never really thought about any similarities. I do remember thinking The Stand was pretty bloated, so never read the re-edit. I like the lean efficiency of the Brain Eaters, and I just enjoy the title. Bold and to the point.I do have to say that the movies '28 Days Later' and its sequel pretty much seem inspired by this book.Variations on a theme.Anyway, haven't read a Brandner book I didn't like."
4,Inspiration for THE STAND?,"If you enjoyed Stephen King's modern classic, THE STAND, (I believe King's best work) then you should read this book. The similarities are striking. Though this book was published five years prior to THE STAND, and garnered little notariety, I believe it may have been King's inspiration. Though I would hasten to accuse King of plagiarism, read this book and see what you think.At under 300 pages, the story is not nearly as detailed or developed as King's work, but this makes for a quick, easy read over a rainy weekend.Where THE STAND focuses on a viral infection which desimates the general population, this book features tiny microbial beings spread through airborne contact and, as the name implies, does nasty things to the human brain. The book also falls short of King's rendition of the struggle of good versus evil, but if you liked King's book, you may like this one even better."
5,Sturdy and expensive looking,What great shelves! We were worried they might be cheap looking or not sturdy but that's not the case! These are great in our toddlers room and look like we spent a lot more money.
5,NANCY Shines On Christmas CD,"This is a wonderful collection of Christmas Songs as sung by the members of the SINATRA clan. Nancy does a terrific job on her songsand is especially moving on the tune IT'S SUCH A LONELY TIME OF YEAR. She leads the way on songs such as O Bambino (a duet with Tina Sinatra, who does an ok job with her vocals). Frank Sr. of course sings well on THE CHRISTMAS WALTZ and Frank Jr. certainly does a fair job with SOME CHILDREN SEE HIM.But it is Nancy who really makes this CD worth adding to your Christmas CD Collection. It would be nice if Nancy would do a solo Christmas CD but for now, it is great that this CD has been issued.Listen and Enjoy!"
3,Nostalgic...,"Those of you who owned the LP and are looking for a good nostalgic rush will be very pleased with this disc. Some others may find some of the tunes a bit schmaltzy, particularly the ones without Frank. Those who are just looking for all the tunes from this album which feature Frank should seek out ""The Sinatra Christmas Album,"" which also features a number of other Sinatra Christmas rarities from 1963-1968, as well as two duets with the man Frank called ""the father of my career,"" Bing Crosby. I feel obliged to mention that the absolute classic Sinatra Christmas album is ""A Jolly Christmas From Frank Sinatra,"" from his Capitol years. Also well worth seeking out is ""Christmas Songs By Sinatra,"" which features many great seasonal tunes from Frank's stay at Colombia records in the '40s."
3,"Sock it to us, Santa!","This is a 24 Karat Gold CD, so it costs more than the average CD. I honestly can't notice any difference in sound quality between gold CDs and regular ones, but maybe that's just me. But gold CD is the only way this album is available, so it's that or nothing. It's a decent album, with Christmas songs by Frank Sinatra and his three kids. Three songs are sung by the whole family, with ""I Wouldn't Trade Christmas"" being the best one. Frank sings two songs, ""Whatever Happened to Christmas?"" and a remake of ""The Christmas Waltz"", both of which are very good. Nancy sings two songs, which are pretty good. Tina sings one song, which is okay. Tina actually sounds a lot like Nancy, but with an untrained voice. Nancy and Tina also sing a duet together, which kind of sounds like Nancy with her voice double tracked. And then there is Frank Jr., who sings the okay ""O Bambino"". This isn't the greatest Christmas album ever, but it's certainly passable, and Sinatra fans will probably enjoy it."
4,Excellent introduction,Pros:1. Rephrases of theorems in more understandable words other than just mathematical terms.2. Use of analogy is particularly helpful.3. Very readable proofs -- just about the right amount of details.Cons:1. Too many trivial examples in the first chapter.
1,Not Worth It,"I'm working on recovering from a martial arts injury. The first part of this DVD reminded me of the fun I use to have warming up in the dojo. But it got crazy fast. I may have comparable strength to some men, but don't even dream of being as strong as many guys I know. I'm not going to do lunges with a railroad tie on my shoulders. I don't have a ton of equipment, nor would I want to invest my time, money and energy into all the things he uses in this DVD. I also could not get the DVD to fast forward, which would be the first DVD that I have seen not do this. This guy seems to really want to show off for far too much of the DVD by adding ego boosting clips of breaking things and the such, which does nothing to help me strength train. Martial arts teaches a lot of technique over strength, which he shows neither in the drawn out vanity clips."
2,pretty bad,"I agree with the previous reviewer: books should be clear and get to the point. Forget about this one. Get Michalewicz and Fogel's ""How to solve it"" book. It is MUCH better than this one in all levels: it is better written and the content is more authorative and helpful to novices and experts.This book is supposed to be a textbook. Maybe that's why it sells so well. I guess I am lucky I didn't have to take a class with this thing."
4,Delightful and poignant,"I found the author captured in a precise way the way it was to grow up during the infant space age. More importantly, she related in a matter of fact way how it was to grow up in a dysfunctional family. I believe many (especially women) of us instantly connect and understand her experience.This was a quick read (I started and finished in two evenings). The pet stories were hilarious. I felt the ending was a bit hurried, but all in all felt it was a very worthwhile endeavor. I'm better for having read it."
3,Tasty Bites are somewhat tasty,"I bought these for my husband to take to work. We've both tried this Tasty Bites dish and found that it is pretty good for packaged food. I also like that some versions of Tasty Bites food come with a container for microwaving. That makes it easier to use this as lunch food. The veggies were a little soft but I would expect that of something that is prepackaged. It's not gourmet food and it is not as good as our homemade version but the ingredients appear to be wholesome. I like that it is Kosher as well. One word of caution, when I purchase this item in the grocery store I have to be VERY careful to check the expiration date. Stores in our area seem to have a habit of leaving these items on the shelf way past there expiration date."
1,"Sorry, no exclamation point","Many of the overheated reviews for this book, which include an abundance of exclamation points, must be from friends or family of Mr. Wright. After having my expectations raised, I found that this book is dull, poorly conceived and amateurish. It is not an excellent resource, since it includes hardly any details, nor is it inspiring, helpful, awesome or any other of the adjectives used by the exclamatory reviewers. It is a waste of money."
2,Missed the mark,"I bought this book hoping it would be all it promised - the definitive guide to convents and monastery guesthouses in Europe. There are no maps and no indexes. The descriptions are very lazy, nearly a copy/paste. The lack of an area maps with the guesthouses marked makes this guidebook very diffcult to use.To the author: try to use this book to find places to stay in any given city - you'll quickly see, it's no help. You need an area map with the guesthouses plotted. In the description, tell us how far the location is from the largest, closest city."
2,OK Starting point,"This book can serve as a starting point for a trip to religious retreat houses in Europe. I wonder if the number of places is limited because Mr. Wright, through his vast travels, has only included his favorites? If so, it would have been helpful to read his review of the facilities. Have to agree with other reviewers that the format and content appear to have been prepared by someone who was lazy or in a hurry. Does anyone know of a website that features similar information?"
2,Disappointing,"The publishers promise a travel-book style, in-depth journey to the monasteries of Europe. What you get is two hundred pages of telephone numbers and interesting facts such as, ""you can join the monks in prayer"". No kidding. The book is a good idea, but it needs to try a little harder to live up to its promises."
1,Not a travel book,Do not buy this as a travel book unless you have a strong intrest in joining the proceedings. It is NOT for the casual tourist.It should NOT be classified as a travel book.I returned it.
2,incomplete and erroneous,"I bought Kevin Wright's book before a trip to Europe. The idea behind the book is a winner; unfortunately the execution leaves much to be desired. (Largish) monasteries that do exist are not mentioned, Wright would have at least one monastery be in a town in which it most certainly has not been for the last 500 years; accuracy is not always Wright's strong point.It's a huge shame that Wright didn't approach the right offices in Rome, as can easily be done done, and assemble a much more comprehensive and authoritative guide to Europe's monasteries and their guesthouses. Instead, he seems to have largely done his research on the web.It may well be cheaper to buy this book than to do tons of web searches, but before doing so, you ought to be apprised of this book's limitations."
5,Great typing program,"Our daughter used this typing program in the 9th grade and we loved it. She was able to learn correct finger placement, build her skills using with speed and accuracy. It provides an assessment of each lesson with feedback on average/fastest speed and percentages. The only negatives I would say is there could have been more lessons and the scoring was unfamiliar as to points they assigned. She easily completed this in one semester."
2,Sadly Small Squirrel,"Though the stories in this series are really very nice, I feel the too small format is detrimental to their enjoyment. I do not think the description of this book adequately conveys how small it is. The pictures are lovely, but again too small to really enjoy. I also found it difficult to hold and show pictures while reading aloud. Overall I was disappointed. Again, it is a lovely and educational story, the book would get more stars from me if it was in a larger format. If you or your child love little things this book might be just right."
1,Pack It Up And Go Home,"This is one of the most boring CDs I have ever listened to. Mr Stepton has been around with some big time bands (in the old days), but he must have been a sideman, not a soloist. While his horn work seems to be solid (miracle of the recording studio?), it is also uninspired. If this is the best he can do, he should leave his horn in the case and let real trombonists make music."
3,Compare Battery Capacity,The Cobra LI5600 has a 650 mAh battery.The Cobra LI6700 has a 950 mAh battery.
1,Oxo good grip Thermometer,I found the good Grip would not stick to the sides of the refrigerator or freezer as they advertised
3,Pretty Good,"The thermometer works, but it does not stick to the wall of the refrigerator that well. The suction is kind of warped. Maybe it is just the one that I got. Other than that, it works."
2,Visually appealing but little else,"Visually appealing but without much of a plot or acting talent. Not nearly as good as ""Valerie and Her Week of Wonders""."
3,"Anarchic, subversive, feminist, and a bit too long","Director Vera Chytilova's anarchic feminist film from the mid 1960s (right before the Czech new wave movement was broken by the Soviet Invasion that ended the Prague Spring) is hard to describe in terms of plot. Basically, it's about the various antics and gags of two young women. The victims of their practical jokes tend to be established society in general (which exists even in a socialist system as was Czechoslovakia at the time), and older men in particular. Aggressively experimental, the movie uses several types of film stocks, even in a single scene, as well as in your face editing cuts. There are several anti-phallic gags (with the girls cutting while giggling sausages, bananas, etc.) as well as an apocalyptic food fight at the end. It's fun, subversive, but even at a running time of less than half an hour, tiresome at times."
4,Amazing!!,"I loved, loved this crazy movie. It deals with feminist issues on so many levels all while having a blast. Very colorful very beautiful. Makes you want to go out and raise some hell. I've been looking for it all over and finally found it."
2,At a first glance...,"At first glasnce this looks like a good machine, no fancy extras driving the price up. Well I purchased this machine and had nothing but trouble with it. It has crashed numerout times losing games, schoolwork, music, everything. Since this machine i am saving my money to buy an APPLE. No more PC's for me."
3,They Fade,"Have owned a pair for now two years. They are dying. While they lasted, they were unbeatable value for money considering. However, after long usage, the higher frequencies are dead, the headphones crackle and pop. Bass is still good. Yet, for 50$ then, not bad at all."
3,"Good sound & comfortable, but they feel cheap","I'd give these phones three & a half stars. I was looking for something for my iPod and movie watching late at night. Senheiser claims these are for ""Home or portable use."" They definitely make my iPod sound great (I'm no audiophile) but I wouldn't call them portable headphones. They're far too big and you'd have to wrap the cable around your body when you're on the go. These are strictly home use only. That being said, they are light and comfortable. The ear pieces form a pretty good seal over (they don't enclose) your ear and they're well padded. I've worn them for 3 hours without any complaints.My only real gripe is that they feel kind of cheap. I'm not certain what I was expecting for $50 but these are essentially a black plastic headband with comfortable earpieces. So far the cheap feeling hasn't impacted their usability but I question their durability over time.So in summation, good sound, good comfort, questionable build and not very portable."
3,It says PINS,"This is a very nice blanket pin; 4"" long as advertised. However, title says blanket ""PINS"" and it is one PIN for almost $6. There are better options."
2,Buying online is tricky,The chain in this product is a lot thicker than it looks. It's not for fine delicate jewelry... unfortunately I'm stuck with a product I can't use
3,Very nice album!,"Great album from this Israeli band, some great western sound. First song is a political protest, the second an Ecological protest. The music is a progressive-pop. very nice. Crimson, Byrds, Beatles,Electric prunes.Promising album"
4,A Triumphant Story,"I really enjoyed this book. It is forthright, honest, and brings the reader along on a journey from struggle to passionate faith. I describe Carol's faith as passionate because it is the underlying motivation for her responses to the situations that she has faced and continues to face. It was a joy to share a few steps of her walk with God. I couldn't put it down. I encourage readers to buy this book. It will strengthen all who desire a closer relationship with our Creator."
2,Jessica Simpson Shoes,"I bought these because they were very cute. I have worn very high heels since high school and can even run in them. Not these shoes, the heel is so strangely shaped that they feel totally out of balance. I would NOT Recommend! They are cute so I'm going to take them to a shoe repair and see what I can do about that heel. If not, I've wasted my money!(I gave them two stars for being cute)"
4,Great resource book,This book is a great resource text. The book has tons of useful info on quilting motifs to hand or machine quilt.The book does the math of enlarging any motif for you. Easy to read and to follow the symbols that accompany each design.
4,"Finally, a face and name to go with the ""Throat""","Along with thousands of Americans I have waited to find out who ""Deep Throat"" is. I had no idea of all that was part of keeping a 30 year old secret. Woodward writes and makes it clear that keeping the secret had as much intrigue as the late night meetings, the flower pot and the NY Times. The book also puts a face to a man too long in the shadows. I think Woodward lets the reader know that he was dealing with a hero."
2,A Persistent Part Of American Political Mythos,"The mystery of deep throat has been a persistent part of American political mythos for thirty years. That is exactly how long Bob Woodward held onto the secret of who helped guide him towards the downfall of the Nixon administration. Personally I was never swept up in this mystery so the who's who just didn't matter. What came across as meaningful was the concept of journalistic standards, an idea that has ceased to exist in recent years. Bob Woodward set the standard for keeping the identity of a deep cover informant but no one has lived up to it since."
4,The Secret Man- a riveting story for journalists and others,"Much as I admire Bob Woodward and think he sets the standard for reporters, I agree with reviews I've read that point out he's not that great a writer. But the material here: the conflicted FBI man and the hungry young journalist are a totally compelling read.I don't know if non-journalists will find this story as fascinating as those of us ""in the biz"" but I could not put it down.Incidentally, my favorite chapter of the book is the addendum by Carl Bernstein, who nicely captured the scene after the news of Deep Throat's identity came out in Vanity Fair this past May."
1,Way Too Short,This book was way too short and felt like it was rushed to the printers. The info in the book wasn't much different than the articles Woodward wrote in the Post after Felt and family went public.Maybe sometime in the future Woodward will write a more comprehensive tome.
5,"Smooth, fast-paced, insightful read","I have never read ""All the President's Men"" or the ""Final Days"" (that is about to change) but I found this latest book from Woodward impossible to put down.This is a fascinating and engrossing read, connecting recent shocking revelations with the equalling shocking events of thirty years ago. I have read some professional critics who suggest this book should offer more speculation from Woodward as to Felt's motives and frame of mind through the critical Watergate years. In my opinion, what makes this book so credible and compelling is what Woodward doesn't know, and, because of Felt's current physical and mental state, never will. He recounts only the facts, quoting mostly his own books and tape recordings, and tells us about his own state of mind, the only one he can accurately report on.I thoroughly enjoyed this engrossing and intimate story from perhaps the single most important sources on Watergate - Bob Woodward."
4,Good book...,"It is a well written book describing the history between Woodward and Deep Throat. It tells most the details that people craved. The biggest disappointment is that after their relationship was strained that Woodward waited too long to get back in contact. By the time he did, Felt was just a lost and confused old man who was but a fraction of his old self. Part of the story will never be told because Deep Throat s no more. Very good read for all watergate fans. Highly reccomended."
4,Mark Felt was a hero,"As a child, I watched with fascination as the best and worst parts of American democracy were televised daily. The Watergate hearings and all the events surrounding it always had one big mystery--who was the inside informant that was feeding information to Woodward and Bernstein? At last, Felt's identity is revealed in this excellent book. It explains how Woodward and Felt met, and explains partially what Felt's motivations were for revealing what he knew--he was outraged at the criminal excesses of the Nixon White House and wanted the information to get out."
4,Surprisingly Good,"This is a surprisingly good book. Woodward is honest and reflective about whether he met the high standards Deep Throat set for him, and that he set for himself. And he grapples with whether Deep Throat was a hero or villain or a little of both -- and concludes, convincingly, that Deep Throat was more hero than villain.Deep Throat's identity sheds entirely new light on the Watergate scandal. That he was the number 2 man in the FBI whose motive was to protect the agency from Nixon's politicization and subversion of law enforcement goes a long way in explaining Nixon's downfall. Yet, Woodward does not shy away from the sordid doings of Hoover and others, including Deep Throat himself. There is a curious resonance between the FBI and the White House plumbers. Is Deep Throat protecting some idealized view of his agency or just his beloved turf?Woodward is reflective and self-critical. This is the best book he has written and is quite moving."
4,mounting,"these dont mount in stake holes. they're not supposed to, at first glance i thought they might but was mistaken."
3,Suds in Your Eye,"I also read this book years ago when I was a youngster, and it stayed with me. I was thrilled to be able to find a used copy.I always remembered the characters - and they were characters - in the book. The theme seems to be if we help each other out, and enjoy life, we'll be fine. The main characters are women who are older, throw in their lot together to survive financially, and drink a few beers along the way. Nothing fancy, but fun and good for you. Like Mrs. Rasmussen's dinners."
1,Jack Kirkland's play isn't Lasswell's book!,"If you're looking for a copy of Mary Lasswell's delightful Suds in Your Eye, don't be misled by the Jack Kirkland play by the same title. Amazon lists it with Mary Lasswell as a co-author, but that's not the case. Instead, it's a play based on the book."
1,A triumph for trite,Cacophonous and trite. Time would be better spent listening to the compositions of Misterrogers.
2,wrong color,"For the price the quality's fine, but the colors wrong. When I got the flag the red is more like the Austrian flag. The Latvian flag ( as in the advertised picture) is deep ,deep dark red the color of blood. Not happy with color, got one with more realistic color?"
5,"Hard to write, looking through tears!","Just happened upon this disk. I was fooling around in Wal-Mart and the image on the disk caught my eye. Believe it or not, one of those listening stations was actually working, so I listened to the samples. I bought the disk, and have just finished the first listen. 14 songs and not a cull in the bunch. I've listened to a lot of music and made a lot of music over many years. This disk ranks among the absolulte best. Good songs, super music, and one of the best voices ever. Do yourself a favor, get this quick!!"
5,Avalon is a great series!,"This book is terrific! It was so sweet how Emily wouldnt give up on the unicorn. And it was sweet how Lorielie and Emily bonded.Avalon is a great series! Ozzieis so wierd, but fits in great. It was cool that Emily had a pet palace! Avalon web of magic the series ROCKS!!!!!"
4,Good if you like Emily,"I was reading the reviews on how other people liked it, but it didn't strike me as ""wonderful"". However, I did enjoy it.I can't explain what, but it was just missing something. Maybe it's because I just finished Cry of the Wolf. I did like most of it, no need to be alarmed. It really streched out the friendship between Lorelli and Emily. What I don't understand is why Emily doesn't have a magic animal. I mean Ozzie is kind of like his own person, if you know what I mean.It was a very sweet and touching story, and I found the Nexus part the most interesting. Emily fans will probably love it. Don't get me wrong, I liked the story and I like Emily, I just think there might have been to much ""bonding"" in it. I gave it four stars because I didn't really like the beginning, but the ending made up for that."
4,The Best EW&F Album of them all,"Earth, Wind & Fire set the standard for funk throughout the 70s and 80s. Their pure, uncompromising sound evolved as the members of the group and the way of the world changed around them, but the music remained great. Never is this more true than on Touch the World, where EWF takes the sound of their beats to another level. No longer the falsetto gang that stormed the scene two decades prior to the release of this album in 1987, EWF allowed their music to pick up, both in tempo and content. The music fits the times, and this album is a winner."
5,Quite a story,This book is a must for military history or space program buffs. It gives a great perspective of what our early ballistic missile program was like. I have read it more than once and will pass it along to my children.
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"This book claims to be ""Everything you need to pass"". Pass what? Certainly not the PE exam or even the water resources section for that matter. It also claims that ""Questions are designed around the new design format"". The new PE test format is multiple choice and all the the test questions are in US customary units, but the few example problems in this book are all SI units. The author claims to provide ""Time-saving power-study techniques"" and ""Expert exam tips"". These tips and techniques must have been left out of my copy. It looks as if McGraw Hill tossed some water resources information together at the last minute and called it a PE Exam Depth Guide. The water resources section of the Civil Engineering Reference Manual by Michael Lindeburg has more information, better example problems, and a better lay-out."
5,"Revelations For A Healing World, Book One","""Masterfully written.......a most comprehensive, clear and concise book that will assist in connecting to and healing your deepest wounds. A must for those on the healing path, giving specific instructions every step of the way. Once you open it, it will be hard to put it down""."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this book as a study aid and reference to assist me in preparing for the MCSE tests. It is woefully and frightfully inadequate for that purpose. The text is replete with editorial and typographical errors and the accompanying graphics are obtuse at best. But worse, by far, is the content. Mr. Keogh has acquired some reputation in the IS community. If this book is an example, that reputation is undeserved. The CDs may be worth the purchase price, but at these prices I can't afford to open them and chance the same lack of quality."
4,Handy product,"I use these frequently for notes, memos and reminders. Handy while driving. Prefer the cassettes over digital as I can hand over a tape to be edited and typed while still using the recorder, Only complaint is the lack of a large compartment to hold multiple tapes, if needed."
3,"Works well, when they work!","I have used two (2) cassettes from this pack. The first, I have replayed over and over and over again for over a year. It still plays very well, even after being left in the glove box of my car (not recommended, lol).The other one came unravelled right after I finished recording, so I was never able to listen to it. Looks like I'm 50/50 on this one, but I do plan to use the rest of the tapes in the pack."
4,6pk microcassette recording tape,"have not used them yet but they are what I needed, blah, blah , blah blah blah, blah, blah, blah"
1,Would not recommend...........,Ordered these for our office for doctor dictation......Three of them were bad tapes and did not work. Would not recommend.
5,Good Price for a good product!,I rather chuckled as I leave a review. All I can say as far as tape cassettes go this is a fine product and there is no static when taping.
4,works great,Been using this tie out for about 2 months and have not had any problems with it. Trolley continues to run smooth even in the bad weather. We did go out and purchase a stopped so that the dog could only travel a certain distance to minimize him getting tangled up in anything.
3,Dog trolley review,"Good value, but there were no stops provided. The dog could get tangled around the poles or trees at either end. I bought two 1/8"" cable clamps for less than $1.00 and put two pieces of rubber hose against each one to form cushions for the trolley against either stop."
4,Sweet little Care Bear with a cute movie,"This Care Bear is a lot fuzzier than other Care Bears we've bought here. He's cute and cuddly, and little ones will enjoy the DVD."
2,Marston was dissatisfied with these transfers.,"When you deal with such old recordings, the most important thing to consider is the quality of the transfers. Although Ward Marston himself made these transfers, he was later dissatisfied with them, and made brand new ones for Naxos. So, if you care about the opinion of one of the best audio restaurateurs in the world, just buy the Naxos set, which is by the way much cheaper than all these PEARL CDs combined.One last thing: these Caruso CDs are among the PEARL CDs affected by bronzing (= CD corrosion). Check online the lists for yourself. So beware, you might spend $$$ and end up with bronzed CDs."
2,Symphony in Steel photos - all in B&W,Just an FYI - All the photos in the book are in black & white. I am a huge Frank Gehry fan and was very disappointed with the lack of color photos. This building's beauty cannot be adequately showcased in black and white. I would not have purchased the book if I'd been aware of this information.
2,"This one was really big, bulky and akward for me",I have another curry come that I bought here on amazon that work really well. This one was just big and akward for me to us effectively.
5,Finally,"I ""FINALLY"" got a chance to get a copy of this CD and the moment I played it and heard the first track on the cd, the music put me in another zone (good zone). The music is smoothing, groovy, and has a nice theory. I was really feeling this cd. It's the type of groove you'd listen to when you're in the car by yourself and don't have no one else to talk to or when you're upset or something. If I could, I'd recommend the whole world to get a copy of ""FINALLY"" because it's a project that soothes the soul and shake up the inner man! Definitely, something for everyone. A MUST HAVE!"
3,Bollywood yarn,"obedience training and crimefairytale, see for yourself, thin plot, over the top actions sceens, good movie to view when you are need to relax andHollywood movies are to violent ***** ****** ******* ****** ****** ***** ********"
4,"An excellent movie, and a well made DVD.","Maine Pyar Kiya is my favorite movie of all time, and I searched for a DVD after having seen it for the first time this year. When I saw it on Amazon for only $9.99, the price was right! The product detail says that it is created upon order, and the packaging is just as a normal DVD bought in the store. The quality of the DVD is a 10/10 and the movie looks and sounds excellent. No menus, no special features, just the movie. The subtitles are excellent as well!"
4,Track 5 is worth it,"The way this song is played on the radio and in the clubs made me want to buy this CD. They sometimes play track 2 as well as track 5 on the radio. The other mixes were not too bad, very different, kinda mood relaxers. BUT that means they were not high energy tunes to dance to. If you wanna hear this song ASAP, buy it. If not wait for it to come out on some dance compilation with a better mix job."
1,hmm well....,well Plummet- Damaged the original version is too slow .. nothing that gets me hyped up... But then again the remix by ATB is way Awesome compared to original.. I heard the atb version and now that is one of my favorite songs.. well that version.. heard the original and was dissappointed.. soo Good job ATB =D
2,Why?,This kind of makes me mad i mean thay were a great band as Plumb (christian Rock) I never thought that Tiffany Arbuckle would sellout so easily If any one agrees GOOD FOR YOU!
4,Required Reading,"The ""political activist,"" obviously a poorly-educated person and a person with an agenda which forbids unbiased appreciation of another person's point of view, provides a misleading review of this book, which is a solid introduction to its subject-matter. Do not be fearful of divergent views which do not toe the party line. Enjoy this book."
3,Rock Latino,"Hi!!! I first heard of Fragmento on college radio 88.7FM in NJ. Go Rutgers!!! Overall it is a good CD especially if you like groups like Mana, La Ley, Santana. The music is very good and I'd recommend it even if you haven't listened to Rock/Pop Latino before. Latin Rock is very diverse and has elements ranging from Salsa, Pop, straight up Rock, Funk, Reggea and even Jazz. In my opinion Fragmento does a good job of exploring all these."
5,destruction of a dream,Couldn't put this one down. Kept my attention through the whole book. Very exciting and full of surprises!
2,maybe only for peole with DRY conditions,"I have been putting off writing a review of this product until I had used it for a while...it has been 3 weeks now...here is what I notice.1. You had better take them AFTER a full meal...otherwise you will be sick.2.My hair and nails do seem shinier...but so does my skin...and by shiny, I mean greasy. I have a feeling that these were ment for people who have severely dry skin...I have had the worst breakout of my life since being on these vitamins.3.I have fairly plump lips to begin with, and I did not notice any change in the size of them while taking these vitamins.I gave them 2 stars simply because I think that maybe if you have dry skin or a condition such as the lady in the other review, that these may actually help...but if you have normal/oily skin, skip them."
3,Darkness Falls: 3.5 stars,"John Barrett (Ray Winstone) wants answers from couple Mark and Sally Driscoll (Tim Dutton and Sherilyn Fenn), so he keeps them both hostages in their own home. As the movie goes on we find out that Mark had an affair with John's wife, who he met at a fancy dinner with Sally. When Mark drives Jane (John's wife) home, she becomes clingy and doesn't wanna leave him. As a result, Tim drives them both in a ditch, killing Jane. Well Jane didn't die instantly, but she was in a coma. Jane is pregnant with Tim's child, and she manages to deliver the baby okay, in a coma and all (baby delivered by c-section).This is a really good movie! The acting was great, and it was very believable. Recommended."
5,Powerful and Beautiful!,"I've never been a great fan of gospel music, but I'm floored by this CD. All gospel, but eclectic styles; EXCELLENT CONCEPT! I'm in love with the jazz style of ""Light of the World"". Tecora manipulates her voice in a way that proves her versatility. I became emotional hearing her arrangement of ""America the Beautiful"" With the events of 9/11, this song means more to me than I thought and this arrangement is so powerful. Thank you Tecora for this tour de force in gospel music."
4,Great Movie!,"If your looking for a movie with action, music, and romance, this is a great movie from Bollywood to watch! Love it!!!!"
1,Beast of Berlin,"Brought this movie for my dad to add to his collection. He did not have this movie and had never heard of it,now I know why. The movie was horrible,my dad said Alan Ladd was in the movie maybe for 5 min. It was horribly made and one of Alan Ladd's worst movies ever"
3,Satan's Baby Doll,"Had much more potential. The blurbs I have read about it don't pay off. It does not contain as much scare value, or erotic suggestion that you might expect it to carry. This is a case where the cover is better than the film. I do like the look of the film, and don't mind the slow pacing, but, if you are going to cover these horror themes you best give it all you got for entertainment sake. Only worth a rental, not a purchase in my opinion. Interview with the director is better than the film."
1,Too Bad,"Too bad Jeffrey Hart writes in a style at once turgid and choppy because his tired ideas have some merit. On the other hand, his reading of Hamlet is so wrong that it's impossible to trust him."
2,Little practical information,"I was intriqued with the title of this book, particularly the subtitle which implies a path to a revival of education. The book does little to describe how we got to the current catastrophe, and even less on how to get out of this situation. The ideas that are missing from higher education are well described, and the arguments for their rediscovery are well laid out. As a school board member, I was hoping for more practical information on the effects of the cultural change that has clearly taken place and good arguments for, and methods to revive those ideas. Instead, I find an allbeit, well written treatise on what essential ideas are missing and why they are essential, but no blue print for how to get back to the basics. Perhaps a sequel is planned. I find the title of this book misleading. It promises more than it delivers."
5,these are book reviews right...,I was just writing this message to ask if this book was any good seeing you jackasses couldn't do anything but try to sound more intelligent than each other. Who cares what whoever said from the damn school board this isn't an editorial. I saw Mr. Hart on television while I was falling asleep and thought his ideas on some of the characters portrayed were very interesting and was wondering if the book was good??????
2,Difficult to manage,"Since I have been using this do do a little construction, I have grown to hate it. It is prone to kinking and forms big 3 and 4 foot loops that stick up in the air and tangle your feet when you least expect it. There is no way you would ever see one of these used by a pro."
3,"GOOD BOOK, BUT NO INSIGHTS","This is a good book, in fact, it's one of the best ASP.NET/VB.NET books I have read. However, it doesn't offer anything new or fresh or different.If you're going to buy just one ASP.NET book, get this one. If you're looking for an advanced book, keep looking."
2,B & K Float,"Be forewarned that this float hooks up with a 1/4"" O.D. Compression fitting. Not really suitable for much, maybe a steam table."
3,Float valve,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P3CQMM/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis valve works fine as long as you can use the float that comes with it.I needed to use a float with a shorter arm -- my tank is not big enough to use the long arm that came with this valve. When I used a float with an arm of only 4 inches -- the float would not shut off the water flow thru the valve. Apparently not enough force on the valve, so it didn't really work for me."
5,Extraordinaire,"J'ai lu le livre (en anglais pour le moment, mais vous pouvez tre certain que je me trouve le franais dès décembre) et j'ai adoré... le caractère des personnage est très solide et j'ai bien aimé la faon dont jk fait s'interrelier les événements."
5,Exactly what I thought I was getting,My wife had a similar watch of the same brand and needed a new one. This watch was exactly what it said it was and at a fair price.
4,One Loud Piccolo,"I just listened again to this recording recently, though I acquired it years ago. I enjoyed its vigor, but surely the most noteworthy thing to say about it -- besides that it provides fine readings of the works -- is that the piccolo in the last movement of the Beethoven must be the loudest ever recorded in this work. That is one loud piccolo for sure!"
3,Compare this recording with others!,"I bought this recording after having read Schuller's book The Compleat Conductor. As many of you may know, he states that the recording is an example of what he teaches in his book: complete fidelity to the score, and attention to every detail the composer put into the work. In my opinion he comes pretty close, but that still doesn't settle the matter as to whether complete fidelity to the score is a good thing. These recordings are not my favorite renditions of these works by any means; yet they hold a curious fascination for me, because they provide an interesting comparison to other recordings and are worth purchasing simply for that reason. There aren't any other performances like them! Whether you like them or not is for you to decide, but they shouldn't be passed off as failures without having seriously listened to them."
5,So cute and so much fun!,Bought this for my son after we joined our local sports club pool. Works great in the zero depth toddler/baby pool. All of the kids want to play with it when he brings it and so many moms have asked me where I got it. Highly recommend! So cute and so much fun!
1,don't waste your money,"this toy lasted only two 20 min. play sessions. really cute idea, but water gets into the battery compartment and the toy dies. don't waste your money."
3,No Pins included,"I would have given you five stars but when I opened the package, the pins were missing. Who buys or sends a watchband without pins? Really..."
2,Don't bother...,"The synch cable is great. Doesn't seat too well on the palm to charge and synch, but it gets the job done and it's small. If you need screen protectors, buy them separately, if you need extra stylus', buy them separately. The case is poorly designed; very difficult to get the Unit in and out of to synch. Not worth the cost; and I've heard the iConcepts cable is better designed - there are better and more cost effective solutions than this package."
3,Nice price but no good,"USB Cable, extra pens and screen protectors are nice but the case is not so good. It doesnt allow the palm to slide very easy and its no good for left handers. Am going to try another case"
5,Worked well for my first thriatlon,"This bag is not glamorous, but it does the job well. It has a lot of compartments that you will need come race day."
4,A Good Book about a Great Author,"THis book seems to be an ode from one of Maupin's serious fans. It was great insight on Maupins, his life, and who he is. I suggest reading Maupins novels before looking into this."
1,Dog Chewed off strap's in 1 minute choking hazard even if Tug toy,I wanted to love this toy. It simply does not hold up for a hard core tugger/ chewer like my Dog.
2,Chewed through handle in minutes,"I read, after the fact, that dogs are not to chew on this toy. What toy do dogs not chew on? I bought this primarily as a tug toy but both straps were destroyed in minutes by my 12 pd. Dachsund, who's not even particularly destructive. Wondered why it was so expensive (bought mine at $17) and figured that it was more or less indestructible when it's actually pretty fragile. A waste of money."
4,Nail Optimzer,"Has only a temporary affect on correcting my problem nails of constant splitting, peeling and breakage. The product dries very quickly which is a plus. Perhaps it would work better if I removed and reapplied it daily."
5,Nail Optimizer,"Have used this product before, it is one of the best! Thought it could only be found through a salon so was pleased to find it here, and at same price!"
2,Not Enough Signs,"I purchased this book after reading reviews. I debated between this one and Teach Your Tot to Sign. However, I returned it within days of receiving it. I realized I don't need activities - I can sign along with songs I already sing to my daughter or while doing everyday activities. What we needed was a more complete list of signs. This book was too limited. My daughter is 11 months old and pointing at things constantly and I'd like to be able to teach her the sign at the time she's interested. It didn't include signs that we need now, like balloon, apple, banana, clock, tree, bike. If you only want to teach your child a few basic signs and want to have fun doing it - this book will work, otherwise get something else. I bought Teach Your Tot to Sign and love it."
4,Laid out oddly,"The very back of the book has many examples of signs that were useful, but the rest of the book seemed to be just a bunch of stories about kids learning sign. Interesting, but not terribly helpful when you'r looking for clear lessons on communicating with your baby."
2,Carr's Kodaly is disappointing,"Despite his obvious competence, Carr falls flat on his endpin with the Kodaly. It is occasionally badly intoned and mostly lackluster.The definitive presentations of Kodaly's Opus 8 still remain those by Janos Starker.This is NOT merely ""my humble opinion"". Kodaly himself, not long before his death in 1967, heard Starker perform the sonata and pronounced it, with the exception of one ritard, ""the Bible"" on how the work should be performed."
4,Needed a little superglue,"Fit my rare Isuzu Vehicross perfectly. Installed last Summer. After only a few days though towards the front of the visors the sticky tape started to separate from the visor to the tape. It was not coming apart from the tape to my vehicle which would indicate I didn't prep my vehicle properly. It was a simple fix using some superglue. They have held pretty good but during this past winter i noticed some loosening again, this time towards the back of the visors(towards the back of the door)So this spring I will glue those. I believe these are still quality parts and was glad to find some for a rare vehicle like the Vehicross."
1,Very disappointing!,"Only buy this teakettle if you want to polish it EVERY day. It looked great when I bought it, but one little drip of water that somehow stayed on the outside (I was careful to wipe it every time I used it), turned BLACK. A shadow of it still remains, no matter no matter how hard I polish it. And the first time I used the recommended copper cleaner on it, the color changed dramatically; it doesn't even look like the same kettle. It needed so much pampering, I finally threw it away. Before I bought this one, trying to spruce up my kitchen, I had a black one that lasted 10 years before I needed to replace it. DON'T BUY THE COPPER!!!!!"
2,WHY!? I ask you,"What possible reason is there to issue this album? First of all the title is misleading since the first song ""That's All Right"" was originally issued on Sun Records, not RCA. Second, songs are taken from all periods of Elvis' career and the songs sound out of place together. Third, there are so many well conceived and organized albums of Elvis' that there is no reason for this one to exist. It's just another attempt to squeeze a few more dollars out of the public. Don't waste your money."
1,give it a miss!,I agree with that other reviewer. There is no reason what so ever to issue this CD! I'm glad it's out of print now on amazon. Give it a miss!
3,Nothing new under the sun,Well first of all I would like to say that the author presents the material in a simple to understand way but I am willing to guess that the great majority of people writing books like this are merely well-read themselves and the money they are making is due to fact that their books are selling because of the fact that people love to hear how they can have anything they want in 6 simple steps. There is nothing really new here and creating your own reality is not a SIMPLE thing for if it were there wouldnt be so many people going from book to book without success. My recommendation: GetThe Power of Awarenessby Neville andAwakened Imagination/the Search. Neville has said it all and was a man who himself lived what he teached. These are in my opinion the only two books you will ever need to learn how to create your reality and I can safely say that if you cant do it using his tools there is no book which is going to help you.
5,Clarity to Create,"This book leads you through the simple steps to create life how you want it. It breaks it down into achievable parts that you can work on now.The first step in the process is to clear the clutter that disguises what you truly want to create, this alone is a powerful tool."
5,best book on manifestation i've read!,"This is a fantastic book! I just can't say enough about what a great read this is! Ghalil seemed to answer every question that you might ever think to ask and has not only an answer, but a technique and detailed approach to implement it.I am a huge fan of books like ""think and grow rich"" and movies like ""the secret"" and ""what the bleep do we know"" but I think this book takes the cake. It really is THAT good.The 6 steps that Ghalil describes are so detailed, organized and well thought out that there is no way you are going to not ""get it"". I will use this book as a resource for many years to come. Highly highly Recommended!"
5,This is something different,"I have read more books in this genre than you would ever want to know about, but this one is truly different. Although much of the basic premise - that your thoughts are the things you see in your ""reality"" - is covered in other books about manifestation, there is something about this one that takes me beyond the merely intellectual understanding that doesn't manifest anything by itself. Ghalil has a nurturing, almost low-key perspective that is very refreshing. If you've tried everything, feel like you understand the idea perfectly yet it isn't bringing the results you want, try this. Give a copy to a friend or friends and watch the energy multiply. Highly recommended by someone who was getting quite jaded on this subject, until I tried one more thing - this book."
4,This is one of the good ones,"I first watched this somehow expecting it to be much like a darker version of Trigun. I was so wrong. The story focuses on mainly two friends, Brandon Heat and his friend Harry, and how they started out from nothing and rose through the ranks of the Millenon organization. To make a long story short there is betrayal, although in the beginning you're not really sure who did the betraying, and Brandon dies, only to come back as Beyond the Grave, and undead being who deals with the nastiest parts of Milleneon which is by this time being run by Harry. My only problem with this series was that there was too much focus on how the guys came up in the world, which while giving a context for what is going on and pretty much explaining everything, it was a little tiresome for me, but I would still highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you like gunfights, love, betrayal, and monsters along the way."
2,Good but not outstanding,"My friends who watch this series with me thought it was great, but I thought it was good but not outstanding. It was almost there, but the script could have gone just a little bit further on some of the positives. The writer appears to have gotten caught up in wanting to write a tragedy, instead of completing the circle of the story. This shows that the underworld is an evil place and, almost, no one can be saved. Where is the hope? Where is the love?"
3,Animation Quality? 5 stars. Price? 0 stars.,"I had purchased the first two discs from this series cuz I love the game. I was shocked, the animation was far better than the game itself. My other shock was that they were $30 each. I sold them on eBay after deciding NOT to support this pricepoint, and hoping for AT LEAST a reasonably priced boxset somewhere down the road. Well, I'm down that road now, and from where I stand you'd either have to be a millionaire to buy this set, or not hip to current price structures for every other DVD box set. Hell, even classic Star Trek and the greedy powers-that-be at Paramount ""only"" ask $100 for a boxset. Here, I'm supposed to pay nearly DOUBLE that already inflated price? HA!! This set should not be more than $50, and I think we all know that.**Please note: If these discs are actually made of 18K or 24K gold then please disregard this rant."
1,Do not buy this. - Jult Warfell,The series had some great concepts. But the story does not make you wanna route for people that are really bad........ bad guys. Waste of time and 600+ minutes of my life........ Jultwarfell
1,Avoid like the plague,"Let me start by saying that I watch a lot of anime. I've watched good anime and bad, and generally I can find enough to keep me watching to the end of the series in all but the worst anime. I couldn't finish this one. It's hard to say exactly what goes wrong because it's essentially a series that does nothing right. The characters are all barely fleshed-out stereotypes, and all of the ones that you're supposed to like are incredibly boring (the rest are mainly sociopaths). This might be forgivable and the series be an enjoyable thought-free shoot-em-up if the action were decent, but alas that too is disappointing. Throw in an entirely predictable plot and there's little reason to watch this. Save your money, pass this one over, there's lots of good anime out there, no need to waste a second of you life on this."
3,Mixed feelings.,I bought this anime a while back and I had some issues with it. The sound quality wasn't that great and I often found myself with my ear pressed up against the speakers of my TV. The story was alright. I personally felt that if they got rid of the genetically engineered monsters and stuck with the gangster theme of it this anime would have been a whole lot better.
4,The Military Life of Julius Caesar: Imperator,"I needed this book for a book report; the seller's description and mail time where right on the button. I recieved an A on the paper, what else can be said."
1,ABSOLUTE JUNK!,"Not worth your time or money! This is not like the old school ones, I remember from years ago. Complete junk, made from thin metal. As soon as I opened package I knew it was not going to work. Weak, flimsy metal. I tried to open a can anyway and laughed when it wouldn't even punch a hole in can. I got so mad at the thing I threw it out, should have returned it. Thank goodness it was only a couple of bucks! Only buy this if you plan on giving it to an enemy or someone you hate.DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY! TRY ANYTHING ELSE!!"
2,Not great.,"If putting Fruit Loops on a string to make a necklace, or pouring Jello into an ice cube tray sounds like creative parenting to you, then you should buy this book.Seems like General Mills ""helped"" the author with this one.New title: How to get more crappy junk food into your kids in 5 minutes or less."
1,This is the WORST ever,"A complete waste of money. If you want to watch two annoying people standing around OUTSIDE where Queen once went, then by all means, this is for you. If you want to learn anything about LONDON or Queen, avoid this at all costs. It's not worth one star."
1,Be ready to fall asleep,"I am a huge Queen and Freddie Mercury fan and I was so excited to get this DVD. What a disappointment. It was so boring I nearly fell asleep. 2 guys (knowledgeable, yes; entertaining, no) droning on and on. There is no atmosphere, no feeling of awe that the members of Queeen once wandered these very streets and buildings. I kept waiting for some big reveal, something interesting on the screen, but nothing....dull, dull, dull. Don't waste your money on this dud!"
1,Disappointng,"I was expecting a lot from this game based on the reviews but the load time per track was horrific, the car handling was idetical regardless of which course was selected and the limited number of courses available to play without winning a championship made me retire this game for good."
2,Very Disappointing,"Wow, what can I say? This is a huge disappointment. I don't think you really need this book because Stridsman's first book is good enough and better. The problem with this book is that the systems are rehashes of articles that the author has already written for Active Trader magazine, and the systems are not even that good. This book is ""been there, done that"" -- it does not advance the technical analysis literature with any new concepts or ideas. I had a strange feeling of deja vu only a few pages into the book. Again, I am really surprised that this book was released - cannot recommend it at all."
1,Worst Money Management Book I Ever Read,"From the content to the writing style this book scores a zero. The book is more of a sales piece for another book Stridsman wrote. I have never heard of someone being so stuck on percentages. Stridsman should be a middle school math teacher. Of course percentages are important, but I don't think we need to pay nearly 40 dollars for a magazine columnist to tell us that. I guess if you happen to want to buy his code for tradestation you might find the book more interesting, but you can get that stuff for free off of many sites. Don't waist your money."
1,very poor writing. Not useful explanation of tools,"I am shocked that this book was published. The stock meanders.The spreadsheet examples are terrible. He needs to supply the spreadsheets on disk or downloadable so that they are easy to use. His explanations of how to construct the spreadsheets is horrendous, because he gives the formulas interwoven with the text of the book. Very bad format. He could just list the Excel formulas in a table and say what cells they are in. Then show the entire spreadsheet as an image so we can see from pictures how to set them up.He made this same mistake in his other book too. He gave terrible explanations that require Tradestation to use the examples. This is a big mistake, because the concepts really should have nothing to do with Tradestation. To insist on Tradestation damages the utility of the book for general purposes."
5,A rewarding challenge,This puzzle was one of the most challenging for me. I am a cat lover and cat rescuer (TNR) so assembling a puzzle of this nature (feral cats) really was rewarding for me.
5,Great!!!,"Loved these two books.I bought them for my daughter that is going into the third grade and having trouble with comprehension. The passages are short enough for her that she doesn't loose interest.Many are about nature, history and science, so she is learning that in addition to the comprehension. She is enjoying the books and is able to do them on her own and she looks forward to doing them.My only wish is that I could find more just like these."
4,Scholastick Success with Tests: Reading Workbook Grade 3,This book has been very helpful allowing my intervention students in 3rd and 4th grades get used to the testing format. It has taken a lot of their fear of the tests away.
5,A+++,A helpful resource for my young son. Perfect for using to help capture the details of what he has read.
1,"Ridiculously out of date, not how Brazilians speak today.","Page 115 tell us the capital is Rio de Janeiro. Hello! Brasilia has been the capital since 1960!If it was only that the book spends too much print teaching us how to ask the barber for a shave, or looking for a milliner to make me a new hat, I wouldn't be too upset, but the grammer and pronunciation the book is NOT Brazilian.My wife, born, raised and educated in Sao Paulo, has forbidden me to use the book. There are too many things (placement of objects, the selection of second person pronouns, pronunication and more) that she had to un-teach me after I studied the book.Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
2,Please buy other Portuguese books,"Oi, Este livro é útil se voc falar algum portugus. If you did not understand what I said, then maybe you should start with a beginner's text. The Cortina method is not properly organized and lacking an audio tape. But, if you are familiar with a couple tenses, this book might be a good review. Lonely Planet phrasebook is a good start and 501 Conjugated Portuguese verbs is great for those desiring business fluency or intermediate students.Boa sorte! -Lisa"
1,brazilian portuguese supplement,The cover states 20 lessons: contains 14. Guide to Pronunciation: where?? Bilingual Dictionary: only 12 pages of Portugues-English. I imagine this book is useful as a supplement to recordings but I will treat it as an addition to some other course. It may be of use - yet.
4,Was interesting for the most part,I liked the story for the most part. In the beginning I was hooked but towards the end it kind of fell short. I didn't like how many years had passed before they found their happy ending but overall it was a good story.
5,ighting Strikes (36 hours),This book arrived quickly and as as I expected from the description. Am looking forward to reading this one.
4,Probably the best package of Neil's RCA hits,"I've done the research, and I'm (pretty) sure this is the only CD that has all 13 of Neil's Top 40 hits for RCA from 1959-63. It also has better sound and photos than its prime competitor, ""All-Time Greatest Hits"". While ""ATGH"" has no liner notes, ""Very Best Of"" has pretty good ones written by Michael Hill. Despite all this, ATGH remains in print while VBO, tied in to the increasingly-less-timely 100th anniversary of RCA's inception in 2001, is not. Grab this while it's still available used, and cheap!"
4,It's a good read,"I read Dies the Fire first and all the subsequent books following so to step back and see the connection between the two series was fun, but you can also see how S. M. Stirling has grown as a writer from this book to his current series. Typos are always frustrating but bearable and some contextual editing could use some help, but other than that this man knows how to tell a story! I was captivated and put the book away in two days, I always enjoy how he seems to research the details he puts in his books like how to make things and where to find items in the real world."
5,"Great Alternative History/Time Travel Adventure, in the Spirit of 1632...","****SPOILER FREE REVIEW****I loved ERIC FLINT'S 1632 Series (Well, the first 2 books before the entire series turned into garbage) and saw this book which was in a similar vein.Bought it and glad I did. Though the first two chapters didn't grab me, i'm glad I stuck through and read that third chapter. From there, I blazed through the rest of the book over the next two days.Love the characters, world building, set up, and writing. Great story and definitely worth getting. I just hope it doesn't degrade like Eric Flint's series.I'm ording the second book of the series now and can't wait to jump into that as well.Overall, the research and plot are well thought out and plausible."
5,A MASTERPIECE OF ALTERNATE HISTORY,"Quite frankly, this is the best time travel/alternate history novel I have ever read! It feels as though the reader is also transported back to 1250 BC with the entire island of Nantucket. The characterization is fabulous and the storyline kept me on the edge of my seat. Once I started reading this novel, I just could not put it down."
4,"A well thought-out story of interge, love and controle.","I always enjoy a good time travel story and this is one of the top five I would recomend to anyone. This employs seveal realistic situations I can amangen if a group of people where taken from modern surrondings and left with only what is in thier emiate surrondes. No factors, farms, to name a few. It's not all everyone following happly one person, but idealist, romatists, and protagenists trying to co-exsist with each other. I really enjoyed the simple explonations in how recreating a pice of equipment involeds a lot of labor. And the assuptions on some historical subject or another is easily possible. I recomend this book strongly to my friend and he finished it in less time then I did. I look forward to the next book."
2,Predictable,"I read of a lot of sci fi and fantasy, and was excited when I found this -- I even bought the two following books at the same time. Unfortunately, I doubt I'll read them. My complaint? Midway through the book, it was obvious how the rest would unfold. I read it anyway, hoping for an interesting twist or surprise, or even some clever moments. Unfortunately, I thought the book plodded forward page by page toward its inevitable and predictable ending -- not even climax, because it just wasn't very interesting.Very disappointing."
5,"A tasty mix of interpretive history, mayhem and fun!","A brave undertaking thematically that leaps over time worn pitfalls with compassionately tenable characters, logical exemplification of society and locale and a course plotted that keeps the sails full till the last page. Incomplete success only in the jacket."
4,"Even in the Bronze Age, you can't escape.","I'm surprised that the sexual conservatives, who make it a point to thrust their tedious prudery into something as innocuous as a review of a book about time travel, can wrap their narrow, meager little minds around a concept like alternative history. Why bother with a what-if genre if you don't like different and possibly uncomfortable ideas? I suggest that if you can't deal with bloody barbaric combat, understated lesbian sex scenes (amid plenty of hetero action, of course), and the mechanics of building a microcosm civilization, you should steer well clear of SM Stirling and instead read something safe and unshocking like ""Life's Little Instruction Book."""
1,Premise ok; grammar and syntax very bad,"I first read S M Stirling's bio on the book cover and really wanted this book to knock my socks off. We both have a Newfie Dad and a British Mom and he seemed well traveled and exposed to many different cultures. I read ""Islands in the Sea of Time"" and although the premise for the ""event"" was plausible enough, I thought the story quite redundant in many areas. The grammar and syntax errors drove me crazy, but compulsive as I am to read a book through to the end, I did manage to finish it and checked out the sequel, ""Against the Tide of Years"" to see if it was edited any better. The errors still continued in the second book, which I was too disappointed to finish reading. As other reviewers have pointed out, maps would have been very handy. The characters were merely interesting, but not dynamic. There really wasn't one character in the book that stood out above the rest, one I could give my heart over to for the duration of the book."
1,Good book bad publisher,"I really enjoyed this book and the whole series. It is inventive and yet relatable to most people. Any books that have me thinking months afterwards are well worth the read.All of that said, I refuse to pay the prices his publisher demands for a digital edition that I cannot freely share or sell. I don't mind buying digital books, I have hundreds, but this type of pricing shows the publisher has no clue on reality. I refuse to support that way of thinking.All said, grab the paperback version at discounted prices until Penguin Books come to grip with reality. Sorry Mr Sterling, you are a great writer but your publisher is not doing right by you or your readers."
1,Not what it could be,"The jacket blurb was intriquing, the story had a lot of promise, *sigh* too bad it didn't live up to its potential.Leave out all the sex and the book would have been great. We all know that sex sells but what sells more is a great story.I would like to read the next books but I don't think I will bother to do so. I just wish I hadn't spent money on this one. REMEMBER!! The public library is a great place to visit!"
3,Interesting at first!,"I both liked and hated the book. I enjoyed the premise, but found the massive amount of historical detail to be difficult to read. I am currently slogging my way through the ""change"" series, on which the writer appears to have done a better job. So, I continue to read despite the drawbacks. I read all three books and found this one to be the best. Perhaps that is because the series was fresh to me. While this is an interesting series, it is difficult to wade through some of the complexities. I must say, though, that this is a wonderfully written society that is fully fleshed if overburdened with contrivance."
2,too long,"I was unable to finish this book, it was way too long and dragged out. The concept was very interesting but got bogged down."
1,Reeks like a cat box,"Numerous logical flaws populate this pseudo-scientific plot, not unlike fleas on an old junk yard dog. I felt nothing but disdain for the protagonists and their pathetic problems. I really wanted the bad guys to knock them off before I did myself in. Two thumbs down, waaaay down!"
3,Must be a guy thing--spoilers,"Really enjoyed the parts about how the islanders survived, but there were tons of boring battles. Didn't hold my interest.As to the criticism that the book was PC, like--what? One of the main characters is gay, but other than that the PC crowd gets wiped out, the natives are all savages, modern life is better for women...how is all this PC?Anyway, there are bits that are interesting but this was, I think, written for more of a military history fan than for me.Three starts for the survival bit."
3,Starts strong and fades,"This book starts out well, but gets pretty mundane about half way through. I've read other shorter Sterling novels and found them entertaining, but I really don't think he is capable of writing a 600+ page novel. His characters are just too weak and grow boring. The book is too long and too politically correct. Too much tedious detail about forming a government, too much unbelievable claptrap about forming an effective fight force out of a bunch of Coast Guard cadets and Nantucket Islanders.I believe Sterling just tried to make this novel do too much. I won't be buying the sequel."
4,S.M. Stirling,"Fast-paced but good detail, both on the characters and their surroundings. Loving these books and the Change series, which are actually part of the same series. Read the Island in the Sea of Time series before the Change series. Or, at least, before the second generation start to explore the wider world. Loving the Change series for the emphasis on the Pacific NW as that's where I'm from. Every place is familiar, though Changed ;)."
4,"Good in book and audio, only one annoying thing","I like the books and I enjoy the audio, but one thing really annoys me. Even though Mr. McLaren does a better job than most of pronouncing the various names of the parts of the ship, he needs to learn how to properly pronounce ""corpsman"" and ""corpsmen."" the p and s are silent--so it's pronounced ""core"" not ""cors."" Every time I hear him say it it makes me want to dig up the black, leather, steel toes boots we had to wear on board ship and kick him hard. I guess being a Navy vet makes me a bit sensitive on the subject."
5,For alternative histoy this is a marvel!,"A bit hesitant to try this author, the book was recommended by a friend, I am now hooked.Mr. Stirling's knowledge of History and Marshall Arts is unquestionable. Using the proper terms for attacks and defenses was refreshing. His Melee sense and description actually had you beside the Captain and Swindappa. You could actually feel the battles. The descriptions of the deaths were detailed to the point where you actually wanted to say; ""OK, enough, I know what happens to a body when it dies now!"" But the constant reminder added to the continued feeling of our loss of fighting hand to hand. When bombing you don't notice the small things like sounds and smells. I am currently on my third read of this book and anxiously looking for the sequel."
4,Excellent book with some disturbing features.,"This is an extremely good story that manages to balance an extremely diverse range of characters and situations. However, when every other race in the book and group seems to have it's heroes, the only Asian that is even mentioned as a distinct character is a homicidal torturer? Balancing everyone's special interest is difficult in a book but I hope Mr. Stirling puts in a good word for some ""good"" Asians out there. Other than that though I must compliment Mr. Stirling on his attention to details and for writing such an interesting and thought provoking book. This will definitely be one I will read again and again."
2,"Good concept,Bad delivery",I just discoverd Stirling a couple of months agoe.While his story concepts are great the delivery is inept.Island in the sea of time is the third book of Stirlings I have attempted to read and gave up on.This book like all of his work has to much detail and detracts from the story.This book is 600 pages of small print.To many words and not enough substance.Farmer could have wrote this same story in 350 pages with normal size print and the story would have been better for it.I think I will pass on Stirling in the future.
2,Politically Correct Anachronisms,"An interesting and well-crafted enough read, but I kept hoping for the oh-so civilized Nantucketers to get wiped out. Anachronism is all well and good when imaginative, but I couldn't help but have mixed feelings at the grafting of modern liberal democratic values onto the Bronze Age. I especially wish that Stirling would get over his female homosexuality fetish, but then I suppose that the undersexed adolescent male demographic enjoys it."
2,"good idea, poorly done","I was intrigued by the premise of this book--the island of Nantucket going back into the Bronze Age. However, I was very disappointed when I read it. I found myself just ""skimming"" to get through it, hoping it would get better!The characters were too stereotyped and one-dimensional. The battle descriptions are way too detailed, long, and uninteresting. And I don't know what the point of throwing in some sado-masochism into the story was.This is obviously set up for a sequel, even though it does stand on its own. I, for one, will not buy it!"
3,"Great series to be read, not to be listened to on audio.","The series is excellent, no complaints. Stirling is a master at the alternate history story lines. The audio however stinks. The narrator does a fine job, it is just how the book is written. It changes scenes often with no other prompting. The narrator will be talking about the crew on the ship, then switch to a scene with the native folk with no warning. Very confusing to follow."
5,"Fantastic epic, worthy of your time!","This is one of the best books I have read in a long, long, time. A fantastic epic, Island in the Sea of Time covers so much ground it's amazing. The research for the book is wonderful, and integrated carefully into the text for a great reading AND learning experience. This is one of S.M. Stirling's all-time best books. The characters are well-done, with a craftsman's touch. You actually _care_ about the characters, whether you hate them or love them. The scenery, the backgrounds, the tiny details-- all of these ring true in the novel. I literally couldn't put it down-- it's a ""read-until-you're- done"" one! Highly recommended, indeed."
4,Island in the Sea of Time,"Alternate history fiction is not the easiest literature to create. Stirling does a great job in setting forth a multi ""What-If"" scenario. In a season of Y2K fears and unknowns, this is a great read."
5,Travel to The Bronze Age With Some Modern Folks,"While reading this book I was reminded of Mark Twain's work: ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court."" Although this book takes place in the Bronze Age. I am fascinated by the way Stirling recreates Indigenous cultures from BC dates. The story will paint images of bloody battles in the readers mind, but it does not stop there. There are some very detailed love scenes that seem very humours at times too. I think it is a well balanced book full of adventure and history. I cannot praise Stirling enough for having heroes in his book that practice an alternative lifestyle. I look forward to reading the other two books in this trilogy."
1,disappointment in Mortimer Adler's Philosophical Dictionary,"This I think this little book could have been valuable to a much larger community of readers. Mr. Adler seemed to be focused on injecting God, and Christianity and his own declaration of supernaturalism than in providing a non-biased Dictionary. I trash-canned the book. Len Reitz"
4,Whorehouse Revisited,"My mother and father use to tell me stories about Pauline's whorehouse in Bowling Green, Kentucky. In 1989, my father found a copy in Atlanta, Georgia and I, at seventeen, had to sneak the book past them to read it.Pauline was a very interesting old gal - but I don't think she had much to be proud of!!!!The book is a great edition to any table top collection - it was insightful and fascinating."
2,Not for beginners!,"This workout is fun to watch but it is very hard to follow, especially if you are used to doing your workout to other videos. There is no lead-in to the change in moves; apparently, you are supposed to memorize the routine! I tried to follow but she moved too fast from move to move without any warning or explanation. Maybe it would be easy for people who are good dancers, but I'm a fitness beginner...and this one was just too hard to follow. The music is great, though!"
3,"If you like to dance, you'll love this one.","I am now in the process of replacing my tape. My old VCR ate the first one. I love it. The dance moves are great. I have yet to master the body wave but I'm working on it. Once you learn the choreography, you can break a good sweat. The cool down is a divine stretch routine set in a relaxing exotic environment.At first, Miss Jamaica was irritating. I guess she added flavour to the production. I got used to her. The only other fault I can find with the production is that the routine was not practiced to perfection before taping. The mistakes ruin an otherwise excellent production. Even with the mistakes, I enjoyed doing this workout. I wish they could remake a new and improved version with `tight' choreography and some toning exercises."
2,Dated,"This is a good video, though it is dated. There is a lot of information that is timelessly applicable. You will quickly be ready for a more advanced video."
3,Not that great,These balls are really only good for rain practices.... They are stiff and hard. Don't come off the hand very well and are slick. Better off with a composite ball for half the price unless it's wet.
4,A story that draws you in,"I almost gave up at about page 60 but I'm very glad I didn't. Once the story goes back in time to tell Clare's story it becomes hard to put down. Stirling pays attention to detail making each character stand out nicely - except for Striker who (perhaps purposely) is not as well fleshed out. The ending has a couple of neat twists, too."
4,A Thomas Merton Favorite,"This work was published after her death against her wishes but with the insistance by friends upon her scholarary husband Jacques,that her words were too important to let die with her. She was a woman much admired by Thomas Merton as an example of one whose life modeled the true self."
2,"Great Pictures, but Outdated and Ideologically Conservative","Although I enjoyed looking at the pictures, I found the book as a whole to have a rather dated feel to it. The text is lousy -- and at various points it contradicts information found in more recent, woman-friendly books like Taking Charge of Your Fertility and What to Expect When You're Expecting."
3,It's okay,"The book came in the condition as described and arrived within the allotted shipping time. The book itself is just ok. It wasn't what I expected. There were more pictures of parents-to-be and trite anecdotes on the experience of the expectant mother than there were pictures of the physiological process of conception, fetal development, and birth."
5,A Child Is Born,A+ new edition of a book that I originally purchased when my son was born 29 years ago. I purchased the updated version for him and his wife. It is excellent! I recommend for all new parents and/or grandparents to give as a gift to their children.
4,Good book,I liked the book and the progess of the fetus each week. I like being able to compare my ultrasound photos to the ones in the book. It made the little baby look like a human when you could hold the photos side by side.The only thing i could have lived without and why I hesitate putting on my coffee table is the photos of child birth...being a first time mother i wasn't exactly excited about how graphic some of the photos were of the actual birth. I don't think my poor husband will want to see some of them. The whole process kind of scares him anyway and seeing 80's photos of women with nothing on shooting a baby out isn't exactly comfortable for him. In a lot of the pictures the woman look in pain and not doing well.Otherwise love the book. Great photos...i wonder how they took some of them.
5,Educational and cool!,I used this book to show my two older children what was going on inside my body during my last pregnancy! They loved it! Let's hope it's inspired my oldest to become a doctor!
5,Wonderful,This is an amazing book and I'd recommend it to anyone. It has a lot of details in it as far as conception through the first few weeks but I loved it!
3,Buy this book for the pictures - not for the information,"The pictures are truly mindblowing but a lot of the information is out of date and inaccurate. I would not use this book as a source for maternity information.On a more minor note it also splits the pregnancy up into strange time periods, sometimes there are several weeks between one update and the next, which is weird for such a picture heavy text.That said the pictures are great and worth the price. (Even if they are mostly the same ones from the 1970s Nilsson Life Magazine spread.) If you want a good resource when expecting, this is not it. The parts with the out of date info are not only irritating but occasionally dangerous and contradict what is written in several other books Dr. Sears books are a very good choice comprehensive and non-judgmental and, some say, not as scary as What to Expect."
2,not what I expected,"I bought this book hoping to see the mind blowing photogrpahs promised by other reviewers. If that is what you are after, I would strongly suggest buying Nennart Nilsson's other book, 'Life' instead of this one... sure, this has a few such pictures but they are intermixed with lame 1970's looking pictures of couples about to 'do it', etc. and a lot of unremarkable text.If you really want to see some interesting footage from the womb, try checking out national geographic's 'in the womb' series on dvd...the one on multiples is particularly amazing."
3,wonderful pictures but need updating,Wonderful book amazing to see detailed pictures of the baby. Great for showing your children what is going on in your body. Other pictures are dated and need to be updated to this decade.
5,A Child Is Born,"The photographs in this new edition are amazing. I bought the book for my daughter, since I had followed her development in the edition I purchased in 1980. Every expectant mother should have this book!"
5,Lovely present for mother to be,"I originally discovered this book when I was expecting my first child in 1974. It has some of the first photography of babies in utero. The amazing photography and gentle, caring explanations of the process of growing a baby and welcoming it into a family are unsurpassed. I have given it as gifts several times, and most recently to my newly expectant daughter. The fact that it is still in print speaks of its quality. It's a lovely book!"
2,Too many warnings!,"When I was pregnant, 31 years ago, I had this book. I loved to actually see how my baby was progressing. Since this book was so important to me back then, I wanted my niece to have a copy (updated, of course!). I'm so glad I had it sent to me instead of directly to her...because I ended up NOT giving the book to her. She is 35 years old and all the warnings would have scared her. Too bad...because the pictures are still amazing."
