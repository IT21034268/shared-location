1,RETURNED FOR A REFUND!!,"I was really excited when my husband surpised me with the game, but became disappointed as I continued to play. I would not consider myself a professional gambler but I do enjoy gambling and frequent the casinos in Lake Tahoe and Reno. I was able to get a refund and exchange the game the following day."
2,Not Poe,"First off, aside from a pendulum that's got a blade on it, this has nothing to do with Edgar Allen Poe's work. It's bordering on false advertising to say it is. It might be better to call it the ""Dominatrix and Her Pendulum"", but you really don't see much of the pendulum. That being said it's a moderately entertaining movie. The acting is so-so, but I think we're mostly supposed to look at the guys doing stuff with their shirts off. Having seen another film by the same director where the shirts off scenes went on too long with guys doing the same thing for the story to have much momentum, this is better. It moves OK. No nudity except for the dominatrix. That made me a little uncomfortable. The ""surprise"" ending was a hard sell for me, but most of the film requires some pretty intense suspension of disbelief anyway so by the end I was in ""whatever"" mode. Would love to see a MST3000 take on it, but with a clever friend you could easily add the commentary yourself."
3,Requires advanced math degree,"Being a professional engineer, although retired, I have lots of time to pursue my interest in astrophysics and associated topics. Time, to me, is an extremely interesting topic -- one which we think we all know, but probably know very little about.Anyway, I had hoped this book would provide a greater understanding of time, and I'm sure it does .. but not for me. All of the material in this book relies HEAVILY on advanced mathematics for understanding -- calculus, differential equations, etc. Unless you are extremely versed and current in advanced math, you will not be able to realize the potential of this book.I couldn't actually rate the book, as I'm no longer instantly conversant with the advanced math in the book. If one were, then I feel quite sure that this book could be four or five stars. But for a layman, or even one with a history of advanced math which hasn't been used recently, it is virtually not understandable. Too bad."
2,Shake and go do not go that far..,"I bought the race cars to go on the speed and go racetrack. After shaking the cars, they do not even go around the racetrack once!! My boys still love the cars becasue of the way they look and the noise that they make. And boy do they make alot of noise! They love to push the cars around the racetrack. It frustrates me becasue I bought several of these shake and go racecars that do not go around the track and use alot of batteries."
3,Shake & Go - Don't always go!!,They really enjoyed them. I had purchased 3 of them and one went like a bat out of...........but the other two needed to be encouraged some. They still enjoyed them a bunch!!
4,shake and go - kid powered is good,"The Shake &Go Police Car racer is great - my almost 5 year old son loves it. Good racing noises, and he has to use some kid energy to make it work. Even though it requires batteries, it encourages him to use his muscles to charge up the racer. About seven good shakes will get 5 full circuits on the race track. Very engaging toy!"
2,"Loud, doesn't always go... but thus far indestructible","I had a feeling that this toy would be trouble when I saw the delivery guy walking up to our front steps with a weird grin on his face. Evidently, the box had been vrooming, vibrating and shrieking throughout his rounds, and he was only too glad to end his term as its temporary steward. My two-year-old has largely lost interest in this toy; he doesn't mind the shaking and noise, but more often than not it just vrooms and then doesn't go anywhere. My advice: buy Matchbox, or Hot Wheels...or something more reliable with volume control. This will probably be in our next load of donations...thrift shoppers beware."
5,What a wonderful book.,"This book is amazing. Anne Eggebroten, whoever she may be, is genius! This book is what every woman who, young or old, white or black, has struggled with the concept of abortion needs! The poignant stories of each woman's experience stay with the reader long after the book is closed. Any man or woman should read this book. It offers a glimpse into the many struggles women go through in the abortion process. Definitely worth a read for those whose religious beliefs clash with their liberal views, or those simply interested in the personal accounts behind a national issue. Buy It! Right Now! You will not regret it and it will be money well spent."
4,NEEDED INFORAMTON,"I read this book several years ago. I recall thinking how refreshing and helpful this information is & needed by so many women today. It is a relevant book. Initailly, I was put off by the title and some parts, which discussed God. I remember thinking how brave and lucky these women are. We all trials & tribulations to reveal about our life. I, too, had a pregnancy to deal with when I was 20 years old. I decided to be a single mom. It would have been much easier to make & face my decision after speaking to other women in a similar situation.While reading this book, I recall thinking how painful & agoninzing it must have been for some of these women to make their final choices."
1,Deception,"This book is dangerous and deceptive. Please do not believe the lie it is perpetrating. I saw that another reviewer named 2 resources for true believers who need healing from the destructive consequences of abortion. Please get those. If you have any doubts - look at a 3 or 4D ultrasound from the very earliest period of gestation. If you haven't done it, don't. And if you have, then seek to be healed - not deceived."
5,Makes all the difference,How much this cream reduces the unpleasant sting was made apparent when I used it on only one leg. The amount of discomfort more than doubled on the un-creamed leg. I would never wax without this again.
2,Doesn't work!,"It was just too good to be true. It is a bit of an inconvenience to remember to do it 30 min before, and I feel subconsious when I go in to my waxing appointment because the cream leaves a white residue. I don't want my wax lady to think I don't clean up!!!"
5,easy music!,"This book is great! The music is very easy, a beginning/advancing violinist should be able to play the songs with ease. The book's layout is very clear, and the music is easy to read."
5,I could not believe this show made it to CD,"I remember finding this cd in a record store. I could not believe that it was made into a CD. I had recorded the concert off the King Biscuit Flower Hour show back in 1982. This provided a great snapshot of the concert. Naturally, the tape broke and I thought I would never hear this show again. Seeing that the radio show only played about half of the concert that I remember attending, this CD was a pleasant surprise.Numerous reviewers mentioned that ""Magic Power"" was not included in the cd. Triumph did not play ""Magic Power"" or ""Hold On"" at this show. What they did play, rocked Music Hall. Rik Emmitt was on fire that night. Gil Moore and Mike Levine were a house afire. For Monday nite concert, it did feel like a Friday or Saturday nite.Truly, a memorable concert that is archived on CD. Thank you King Biscuit Flower Hour."
4,A TRIUMPHANT SHOW,"Never really much of a fan, I only liked a few songs from Triumph. I thought alot of their music was generic, and it still is, but for some reason this CD shows them in a lively, energetic, exciting and down right fantastic form. Rik Emmet is a killer guitarist and one heck of a vocalist, sometimes resembling Ted Nugent, Rik is the only reason to get this CD. He's wild and wailing away on his guitar throughout the show. The downside of it all and there are 2 reasons. The big one being drummer and singer G. Moore, he sucks as a singer. He sounds as if he has a clothespin on his noise, it's annoying. The 2nd reason being the song Magic Power is nowhere to be found. They're touring the Allied Forces album and wasn't that song on it! #@ Oh well, other than that, this is a really awesome CD, even for those like me who don't really like the band, you'll be surprised on how they are live."
1,bad print/edited version,"i don't know how many versions of this movie are floating around. i know there is Synapse version which is short, this version and a japanese uncut version and maybe a few others. this version is full-screen taken from a bad print. the color is off and even at 91 minutes, it's edited. oddly enough, there is a wide-screen, unedited 99 minute version in a boxed set called ""nightmare worlds."" the movie itself is an italian flick from 1976, and if you're into italian horror movies, you know what you're in for. bad acting, bad dialogue, nice scenery and ample nudity with good-looking actresses. anyway, if you're interested in this werewolf movie, skip this version and go for the ""nighmare worlds"" compilation. there is no comparison to the quality difference."
1,I don't even know how to begin...,"I've read many lesbian books over the years, and found this one by accident here in Brazil. I don't think I can't blame the traslation for this book really lacked what I think makes a good story. There were so many characters, and not one felt real to me. The stories were so clich√©, I felt like slapping every lesbian in the book.The problem with not having many options for lesbian fiction, is that many of us think anything agy is ok. But it is not. I'm not asking for Sarah Waters here... but at least something new, and well written characters and plots."
5,A really great adventure,"Just my two cents about Fate fo Istus. This out-of-print adventure is truly one of the best TSR ever did, it can be used in a campain, or just separated modules (i holds 12 of them).I played and DMed it in the past, and it was always great fun. I udes it often to introduce new players to AD&D , because its more an adventures that relies o thinking and smart actions rather than on rulings and dice throwing.... the 12 modules are all ""targetting"" a particular character class, so it is cool for big groups or lots of multiclassed... a small disadventage is that some of the stories assumes the -ppresence of ""defunct"" classes (i.e. assassin and barbarian..)."
1,Monster Truck,"Do not buy this toy. Not user friendly and most of all, battery life was terrible.My son was very disappointed in this because the battery kept going dead.Plus it wasn't easy to put the battery in either."
4,Interviewing for Solutions,The book was in great condition but took a few more days than I thought it would..All in all wonderful experience.
3,Didn't Remember a Lot of It - Lots of British Items,"I grew up during the 70's, but did not remember many of these items. I should have realized the book would be that way(mainly British) since I already own the ""50's"" and ""60's"" edition, but since the 70's was my decade, I felt I had to get it as well. Disappointed, but still enjoy perusing the pages for the patterns and colors of the 70's."
5,Great book,I practice Tai Chi with this book and I it's easy to follow instruction of this Master. And it's great that now I have this book on my iPad.
4,Good Powerful Heater,"I bought this heater to help save on the gas bill this winter. It seems to be a good powerful little heater. I am using it in the living area and right away noticed a difference in temperature. The oscillating feature is nice and so is the remote control unit. There does not seem to be much of a difference in noise level between the high and low setting, but is fairly quiet. All in all a good heater for the money."
3,It's a keyboard alright....,"It's not like any of the other legendary IBM keyboards in the past, most notably the Model M, but it is an IBM, and is built like one. So it has some pros there."
5,Non stop boogie from start to finish!,"Too bad this is just a one hour set made for radio play. I couldn't help but get up and boogie to the Heat's infectious foot stomping beat when I listened to this CD this morning. Canned Heat's studio work is great, but their live performances are legendary for pumping up the audience and this King Buscuit performance is no exception.What is greatly needed - and long overdue - is a double CD of Canned Heat doing a full extended length set. What ever happened to their Woodstock tapes? The new Jimi Hendrix Live At Woodstock double CD is great - but can you boogie and dance to it?Long live Canned Heat and long live boogie!"
5,CANNED HEAT KING BISCUIT FLOWER HOUR,"THIS CD IS A MUST FOR ANY FAN OF CANNED HEAT,WITH, THE ADDED BONUS OF ""HOLLYWOOD FATS"", AKA MIKE MANN, ON GUITAR. THERE ISN'T A BAD CUT ON THIS FABULOUS RECORDING.OF THE SMALL AMOUNT OF RECORDINGS BY THE LATE FATS, THIS IS A TRUELY GREAT FIND.THE TWO BOOGIE CUTS ON THIS CD ARE OUTRAGEOUS!TURN YOUR FRIENDS ON TO THIS CD.GLORIOUS!"
2,"Good book, but nothing new","I read it. It is the good book, but it contains nothing new. If you read: PIMP by Iceberg, Pimp game by Royal, Pimp Bible, Gentleman Pimp: The Autobiography of Andrew Stonewall Jackson and Art of Macking by Tariq X-Flash and saw American Pimpyou do not need this book.It describes certain situations, but it did not describes ""the anatomy of the game"": which approach to use in particular situations with the ho, building the image of success, turn out procedure, when to fire a ho, etc.Based on my previous reading, I could wrote that book and I am not a pimp. So, how good this book is?It is similar to PARADISE's SPACE AGE PIMPING ......, lot of quotes, quite a lot of useful advices, but nothing specially new to the books I already quote."
5,"""Reppin"" The Bay Area","Damn good book. Lots of details. If you don't have it, buy it right now. Also, get the soundtrack CD. I had the pleasure of working with Mr. Starr on the product. Wait! Coming soon! Be on the lookout for the movie. This is a three prong powerful package. Real pimping in full effect..."
5,Amazing Vocals! Cool Guitars!,I saw this band back in the days of Headbanger's Ball on MTV. This is cool stuff. I am really glad that it is available again.
1,did not fit,again the description was confusing but i needed the item so i took a chance and it was too big. but thanks to amazons great return system ups picked up my return with in 1 day. thank you amazon
5,pretty versatile,"I ordered this thinking it was fleece and I loved the design. However it isn't fleece, but it is a very nice smooth soft fabric. It is stretchy which makes it able to be worn in many ways. I won't be wearing it for very cold weather but it is great for chilly days when I don't want to wear a full balaclava. Great product!"
3,Someone cut a leg off an elastic pant,"The product is simply a ""tube"" of thin cloth. I do not wear it over my nose/mouth, I just wear it on the neck for extra warmth.The title says, ""Someone cut a loeg off an elastic pant"" - That is what it reminds me of but that doesn't mean it's not handy for the task you want to use it for."
3,Great for summer,but not for winter. Very thin... almost see thru. I had one before i ordered this one. Needed another to swap out but it was a lot thinner. The shipping was quick and the product is what it says it is just not as thick as I was hoping for.
3,cheap cut,The material is nice but they could improve on the ends. The ends of either sides looks very poorly cut.
5,Excellent Knee Support,"This knee support does what it advertises. It provided stability around my injured knee, which allowed me to walk with greater confidence to/from work. I recommend this knee support product."
3,What they look like,They are too soft for any meaningful patella support. Truthfully seem too soft for any kind of meaningful support.
2,Not what I hoped for,This knee brace had less support than I hoped for and it doesn't stay in place very well.
4,Excellent while they last,"This product worked very well for me. They were comfortable, didn't significantly impede movement, and provided the compression my knees needed. The fit was perfect. I liked them significantly better than Futuro's other knee support products which I also tried.Unfortunately, after about a month now (walking 4 times a week for 2.5 miles), they are starting to really stretch out. I have to use the tightest possible position on the top strap to keep it in place and the middle no longer provides as much compression as I'd like.As I can just barely get these to go over my calves, I don't think the medium size supports would be a good option for me, especially since I found these tight when I first bought them."
2,Useful?,I'm returning this product. I tried wearing it. It fits my knee but I knew right away that it doesn't help. It doesn't give a good support to my knee. It's like wearing something on your knee and that's all. I wonder if this product is useful to others but for me it's not. So I'm returning it
3,Knee braces,"These give medium support to the knee. I was hoping that they would be a little stronger to support better. For the price, they are a good value."
3,No 2000 SE,"I just got this and it doesn't have the Godzilla 2000 Special Edition. Just the regular English dub. It seems like everyone was saying that the 2000 dub/sub would be in here, so I'm wondering where the misinformation originated. The only saving grace is the 3 oldies with the original Japanese track."
5,Great deal!,"Have to say, I purchased this only because the price was so good. Had no idea what it smelled like. Was pleasantly surprised!"
1,Doubting it's authenticity,"At first I was pretty happy with this purchase. It smelled nice and while I noticed the scent only lasted an hour or two, I got a 3.4 ounce bottle when I only paid for a 1.7 ounce bottle and I paid like 1/3 normal retail price.The other day while shopping at a department store, I saw this cologne at the fragrance counter. I gave it a quick spray on my wrist (free cologne!) and noticed it was much stronger and more pleasant than mine. The single spray also lasted longer than the 2-3 I usually use.I'm seriously starting to believe I received a knock-off. The price is almost too good and the scent isn't as good as the stuff from the department store. Amazon should look into this."
1,Nautica Voyage By Nautica For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 oz,Not as advertized. I prefer much cheaper GAP perfume since it is much better and lasts much longer than this one. Looks like Nautica spent more on the outer glass than on the inner liquid spray.
5,Great,"The smell is pretty good. Although NAUTICA is not focusing on perfume, I do like this one. By the way, the color of the bottle is cool."
4,Not a heavy user but not bad,I bought like 3 of these for X-mas present and all my friends love em.This is the best price you can get!I would recommend this to anyone
1,Fake product. Shame on Amazon for selling this,Product is certainly not the original. Doesn't stay on for even 10 minutes. I tried the original at Macy's and a vast difference in scent and in durability. Don't buy these cheapos... You have been warned.
4,Comparable to many expensive ones,"Smells great and longevity is just about right. I do not smell anything after 12 hours, but who needs it more than that. My wife is fine with it. It does not hurt my 20 months old son's nostrils when I take him."
3,Smells good but it doesn't last....,The smell is great but it doesn't last long...it would be a 5 star cologne if it last at least 5 hours.....
5,Best,"This smells absolutely wonderful. It is a gentle scent that lasts all day,it is simple and classy, and absolutely sexy and you will get lots of compliments."
1,Buh! Don't be fooled,"If you searched for men's cologne in the search box, and found this cologne as a top result - don't be fooled. I'm telling you this because I was.It's nothing more than just a generic - I got tired of it only after using it just for the first time - its cloying, and makes me nauseatic. I just can't stand the cheapness it is filled with, just so artificial. Get a Bvlgari Black or Extreme instead.I tried to use it as a room Freshener, but ""Hey!"", my room says, ""Spare Me, will you?"" So I believe I will end up giving it away.If you are a genuine cologne lover, you will end up adding this to your bunch of rejects-- just skip this one and save your 20 bucks, since Amazon's return policy won't let you send this back."
2,severely disappointed,"Thought I should give this cologne a try since it is a name brand for a cheap price. Never again will I buy this cologne. When I first sprayed it on, I got the strong chemical scent, which is normal at first. But after a while I assumed the smell would morph into something wonderful....I was dead wrong. It didn't really change much. If anything, it just got really soapy. Its a terrible, headache-inducing cologne. What a shame."
5,Best Bang for your Buck!,"A ""best bang for your buck"" fragrance, Nautica Voyage is easily worth the 20 dollars or so that you'd spend to buy a large bottle. The apple, lotus, and mimosa notes blend very nicely to create a perfect casual summer cologne. Voyage goes on a little scratchy at first, but after 15 minutes or so it settles in and creates a beautiful scent trail. It's citrusy, with just enough sweetness to take the edge off, and the right kind of florals to round it out. What I like most about Voyage is that there's this root-beer like fizz in the mix of it all as well. What you ultimately get is an appealing and addictive accord that persists for several hours before settling into a skin scent around the 3 to 5 hour mark. Projection is average. Voyage is appropriate for any age and best suited for Spring and Summer."
3,"Smells good, while it lasts","I have had several women comment that I smell good while wearing this product. However, it seems to dissipate within an hour or so. If it lasted longer I would give it 5 stars probably."
5,My favorite Scent yet!,"Voyage, the best scent I own. From the second I put it on, I could not stop smelling it ( in a good way). Its not too strong, and not too light, it lasts a long time, and it has a unique, refreshed scent. It has the scent of rain and outdoors type, there is no other good way to explain it other than pure awesome-ness. I would recommend this to anyone."
4,Nice for all-day wear,"I like this fragrance! Not too bold; not too subtle, but a clean, just-showered fresh scent that last for most of the day. I recommend its use for all occasions, and the price (per fluid ounce through Amazon for a 100ml bottle) is hard to beat."
1,feel,"smell good! but it not keep long time, just 2 or 3 hours. i hope you have a another one better!"
3,not that good,"it is not that good as I expected, may be something wrong with the company or with the product, I am not sure..may be i am not going with this perfume again..."
2,Headache Inducing!,"I have really, really tried to like Nautica Voyage, having worn it several times now. Each time I wear it, it gives me a severe headache with its overwhelming grassy/musky/soapy scent. This stuff is truly a fragrance monster, and a few drops is all anyone would ever need should one be able to wear it without suffering side effects like mine. I don't understand why it is rated so highly, as there is nothing beyond a STRONG cloying and frankly disagreeable scent that makes it ""special"", such as it were, and there are SO many other men's fragrances that succeed where Nautica Voyage does not. If you are thinking about trying this one, please get a sample first and wear it several times before purchasing. It's relatively expensive (as are all high-end fragrances) and it's truly a shame that I will have to give this one up."
1,WATER!!! Nothing but WATER!!!,"Goes to the TRASH can, that's where it's belong to. Don't even think it will benefit you in anyway. It is a rip-off so-called product. Shame on you Amazon, it cannot be returned!!!"
3,Nothing out of the ordinary,"A normal fragance, but I think for the price, its ok. If you want something better I recommend buying fragrances in the range of 50-100 dollars."
1,Did not meet my expectations,This product did not meet my expectations. The smell does not last at all and it seems to be watered down.
3,Fruity smell!,"Tell you the truth, this cologne should have been listed as women's cologne!. It is too sweet smelling for being a man's cologne!. I gave it to my sister !"
2,FAKE FAKE FAKE avoid buying this,Totally a fake. Smells nothing like the real thing and lasts for 1-2 hours at best. Faintly smells of rubbing alcohol. DO NOT BUY. Bought mine direct from Amazon.
2,doesn't last too long..,you get what you paid for.this fragrance doesn't last too long.it begins to wear off quickly after 30 minutes.dont' expect too much!bought it right here on amazon.com
3,Nautica Voyage By Nautica For Men,"gave it to my son, he really like itNautica Voyage By Nautica For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 1.7 oz"
5,great smell and cheap price,I recommend to you this water; it is as advertised and the price is very attractive! do not hesitate! like me
4,clean light fragrance,"this is a very light clean everyday fragrance. i am a teacher and its perfect for work. not overbearing or to strong @ all. very nice clean scent. its def something to buy especially for the AMAZING price! like all fragrances from this website, i would ONLY purchase if its sold by amazon! i would not trust any fragrance from any other seller. ive read too many horror stories."
4,Pretty good,"I am pleased with fragrance and the bottle has a very nice heavy feel to it.I feel the spritzer could be better, it doesn't disperse very well."
4,Nautica Voyage,"This is a great product and got for a great price. I like several of the nautica colognes and this one as well. Smells really good, already had compliments on it."
5,Can Smell This Next Day - Longevity for Your Entire Voyage,"Longevity is something you search for in a designer fragrance, and Nautica Voyage delivers. One to three sprays of this scent, and you'll be able to smell it the next day. Seriously. I have smelled and tested hundreds of colognes, and Voyage is near the top for a lasting fragrance. This lasts longer than Chrome or even Obsession. 1 Million might last a bit longer.You get this fantastic long lasting scent from the minuscule amount that the sprayer puts out. After all, that's why we buy expensive cologne, right? See for yourself. Go to a store. Spray a fragrance card. Smell that card in a day or two, and it will still smell like Voyage.Spectacular aquatic scent. Fresh and clean. Somewhat akin to Cool Water, but better, and oh so long lasting. Nautica makes many appealing aquatic fragrances. This is my favorite. Find it in retail stores for $30+ an ounce, then come to Amazon for a better price on a wonderful product."
1,Mine wasn't genuine,"I am disappointed. I bought one of these from Amazon and it is not genuine (I compared it to the one from the department store I bought a couple of years ago). I looked for the tell-tale signs...turn it upside down and look at the bottom. A genuine Nautica will have a Nautica sticker on it (it will say 'Nautica Voyage' in big letters). It should also have some sort of stamp of numbers (my original Nautica from the store had 4 numbers in black dot ink). Also, my bottle from Amazon was poorly made; the bottom of the inside is not straight and quite noticeable. Lastly, the Amazon bottle smells slightly off after an hour. I also had my wife smell my shirt where I sprayed different spots with the 'real' bottle and the bottle from Amazon...she quickly identified the imposter."
5,Very pleased,This stuff smells really good. The bottle itself is nice and heavy and the stuff inside it's totally worth the price in my opinion. Better than Nautica Blue and I really like that stuff too!
3,Pleasant Smell - Fades Quickly.,"I purchased this because of the great price and thought it would be great for everyday use. The smell is pleasant enough, not strong and overpowering. The only problem (pointed out in other reviews) is that it doesn't last very long. At the price though, you can't lose!"
5,voyage- SMELLS GREAT,"Took a chance on this cologne. To say the least, I was NOT disappointed. Voyage has a fresh and clean smell. Its not heavy- but don't mistake that for a pitfall. It scent lasts throughout the day. Amazon's price is a major value, as I've seen Voyage at department stores for nearly double the price...."
5,Nice gift,"Got this for my husband. He likes it and I find the smell quite pleasant and nostalgic (of what, I don't know!)"
3,NAUTICA VOYAGE,NAUTICA VOYAGE For Men By NAUTICA Eau de Toilette SprayNAUTICA VOYAGE For Men By NAUTICA Eau de Toilette SprayNAUTICA VOYAGE For Men By NAUTICA Eau de Toilette Spray
5,Surprised!!,"I thought at the price it was worth the risk right? So what if I get a knock off at least I took a shot at it. So it was a little worry some when the tracking number was not working on the DHL web site. That was explained by the fact that it arrived in my mailbox. DHL does not track standard mail items, only packages sent UPS style. (at far as I know)Arrived in my mailbox, product unopened still sealed in plastic wrap! Fantastic, this stuff costs me usually about $70 bucks. I am ordering one more possibly two simply due to the price and the successful delivery of product.Great Job guys!ctompkins"
5,makes me wanna rape my husband more than usual,i love this product . the smell lasts for a long time and it makes me wanna jump on top of my husband . thank you nautica for making my midnight dreams come true.
3,DECENT SCENT,"Was looking to add something new to my cologne collection and came across ""Nautica Voyage"" on sale at ""Amazon"". In a nutshell ""Nautica Voyage"" is a decent scent for going to work, church, or on a cheap date. Smells okay but won't turn any heads......no ""wow"" factor."
2,"Great smell, but wears off about 10 minutes after spray","I have bought this from a retailer in the past and smelled great/long lasting. But this has a very weak scent, it staym with you for around 10 minutes and it wears off!! my gf told me that she can only perceive the scent when her nose is in direct contact with my skin."
2,Not Effective At all,"I am not sure if I received non-original version of this product but it just isn;t effective at all.It does not long even more than an Hour.Although I did not return it (for the sake of avoiding hassle) but I will not recommend it to anyone.Its very simple,light,ordinary and does not serve the purpose.Recommend to avoid it.... Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Dilluted,The bottle looks like its real but once you put it on it does not last.This must be dilluted or not original because the smell is weak and does not last like the cologne you buy in stores.
1,Worst smelling cologne...,Smells horrific.. Stay away from this thing.. Does not have any undertones just awful does not smell like water or anything like that..
2,Not as good as it looks,"It comes in a very nice blue packing. You use it for the first time, it smell ok not great. You can still smell it for few minutes. But after sometime it disappears. I have used Nautica perfume before, it was great. But this time I am highly disappointed."
2,Spray leaks!,Just received this cologne. The smell is OK but not great however the main problem is not the scent but the fact that the the bottle leaks. This is a non returnable item so I'm stuck with it which I don't believe is right because the product is DEFECTIVE.
5,Smell fresh.,"I like a lot this perfume, the smell is so fresh and everyone smell like it, i have allergies and it didn't annoying to my nose, perfect choice."
2,"Nothing like the ""real"" mopes aka the legendary mopeds","Maybe they're better live. This album is power pop rehash, the tunes are greenday-ish, the band can play it's instruments well, maybe too well, and the feel is mega-wimpy compared to possible inspiration The Jam or Ramones. The ""real"" mopes or ""original"" mopes -also known as the mopeds- were an electric duo from the east coast usa that broke up in 1987, they blasted crazy punk rotten psychedelic grooves and ironic bombast. You can checkout a new site dedicated to their memory for free mp3's( www.themopes.com ) and compare for yourself. The old dive-bar heroes or the new punky popsters?"
2,"nothing like the ""real"" mopes aka the legendary mopeds","Maybe they're better live. This album is power pop rehash, the tunes are greenday-ish, the band can play it's instruments well, maybe too well, and the feel is mega-wimpy compared to possible inspiration The Jam or Ramones.

5,The Bears are Back in Town,"I got my Bedtime Bear today. Its so cute, and soft. I love it!Not just for little kids...I'm 17!I have wanted one since the 80's!"
5,I love Care Bears,Care Bears are awesome!!!!!!!!! I love the Care Bears. I'm 15 and I want all of the Care Bears!! They are so back in style. I plan on getting all the bears for Christmas.
2,Listed as new but wasn't,"This book was listed as new but however, the dust cover of the book I received indicated that a free CD was included inside. There was no included CD. Generally, this wouldn't have been a big issue fro me but since I had planned to give the book as a gift the missing CD was quite problematic."
4,Fun Reading,This book is the kind of book a person might enjoy as a rest from study reading or or serious academic reading.
4,The CD was cool...,"I loved the fact that the book came with a CD, since I had never seen that offered in a quote book before. However, the book was peppered with quotes by the author himself. While that is cute, and probably fun for his friends and family who bought the book, it kind of takes the momentum out of the book...just seems kind of silly.Either way, I am a huge fan of short, easy-to-remember quotes, and this book has plenty of them, so I gave him a positive review. There are definitely a few keepers in here, and it is a cute book. Enjoy!Todd HagopianPresident/CEOHagopian InstituteAuthor of the popular ""Quote Junkie"" book sereies and the brand new ""Idiom Junkie"" series"
3,Literature ?,"As books of this type go it is about what I expected, a real novelty. I may find a few items to quote, but most are not very profound nor of great interest."
4,Better than average collection of witticisms,"This book lends the perfect quip for every occasion, from ironic to inspirational. Light reading for times when you want to be amused. I liked it so much I ordered a second copy to give as a gift!"
3,Good Resource,"This book lends an array of good quips for every occasion, from ironic to inspirational. It's light reading for times when you want to be amused. The title seems arrogant and a major overstatment, but there are indeed some good quotes to be found here. If you are looking for a truly outstanding collection of quotes, as I was, I suggest you read ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Wisdom"" by Taro Gold."
3,Ignore the overstated title and find a few gems,"The overstated title sets aphorism afficionados up for disappointment. If the author had simply titled this collection ""Personal Favorites,"" the reader might then have found more than he/she had expected. Shanahan may have made and earned his great success, but what can he have been thinking when he included his own personal sayings among ""the most brilliant thoughts of all time""? To borrow from a friend, ""one wishes someone else had said it."""
5,Wisdom of the Ages,"This is not only an excellent book, but an excellent tool as well. It will arm you with two line pieces of wisdom for your own use or to share with others. I've used some of the quotes in business meetings, out with friends, etc. Everyone should have this one."
3,A Few Thoughts on The most Brilliant Thoughts of All Time,"As a writer of greeting cards, needing upbeat and optimistic content, this book was not it. I found too much of the material was cynical, and as someone trying to find positive words to quote, this was definitely not the vehicle. The book did however have a real variaty of quotes, categories and subjects. Lots of tonge-in-cheek material if that's what you're looking for."
1,Choose another one,"I purchased this book because I edit a newsletter and needed quotes so I could create cryptograms. I find myself paging and paging through the book, unable to use these obscure, often negative and sexist quotes (was it really necessary to include all those quotes by men voicing their sexist views of women)? The themes are too similar, as well - they all seem to be about human behavior and the human condition while it would be nice to have a wide range of topics, such as the natural world, seasons, holidays, for example. Choose another book of quotes."
3,Carry right too far and it becomes wrong,"As I have just finished reading the book of Baltasar Gracian ""the art of worldly wisdom"" which is a must on every serious readers shelf , I picked up this book to relax my mind and enjoy it.....I must admit that it is very easy read and one can finish it in a couple of days since most quotes can be found written at the back of public toilet doors. A good book overall but far from brilliant.Pascal Hagge"
2,You've got to be kidding!,"If this editor really thinks these are the most brilliant thoughts of all time, he needs to get out more. A few gems, but mostly tired truisms from the 1900's and before. Nothing much new. I found this book disappointing and boring, which is unfortunate, since it includes a CD with all of the content included. But here is some good news; if you are looking for something similar that will really inspire and entertain you a far better choice is-""A Dancing Star: Inspirations to Guide and Heala wonderful book that was given to me by a friend 10 years ago when I became ill with a chronic disease. I still read it all the time."
1,Shameless Pandering to Stupid People in Search of Putdowns,"Save your money and hang onto your old Bartlett's Quotations. This pathetically mass marketed compilation is aimed squarely at dim bulbs whose idea of a good day is having been blessed with one timely scalding rejoinder. As if the Salieri of ""Amadeus"" could tap into Mozart's muse by reading a book. Brilliance out of context equals drivel. What a simple minded, mean spirited bore!"
1,Tripe,"Perhaps, if one is going to say that he's collected the ""most brilliant thoughts of all time,"" he should review his grammar and note the difference between ""two lines or less,"" and ""two lines or fewer."""
1,John Shanahan Has Got to Be Kidding,"Mr. Shanahan shows unmitigated chutzpah in sprinkling sayings of his own throughout this book. That gives me an idea: I am putting together stories about the greatest moments in all of sports history, and will now include that time I hit a home run to win a big stick ball game when I was in the eighth grade. How can readers take this collection seriously when it is, at best, a cover for shameless self-promotion by its editor? Shame on Mr. Shanahan and shame on the publishers!"
1,Because 1/4 star was not one of the options,"This may very well be the worst book of quotes ever. Unbelievably, the editor generously sprinkles his own inanities throughout the book! There are two in the first four pages!!"
3,"Amusing, if shallow","I would feel pretty ripped off paying full retail price for this game back in the day, but as a used edition for a few bucks it's fun just for the heck of it. Clayfighter II (the pic here shows the original) parodied Terminator 2 in name (Judgement Clay), and was a Street Fighter clone with fighters done through claymation. Gameplay is rather shallow and the special moves are sometimes unresponsive. However, the fighters and backgrounds are consistently amusing to look at, and are sometimes downright bizzare (like a homage to dogs playing poker, and a street full of ghetto-looking babies).Really this is one of those games where your amusement grows directly in relation to the amount of alcohol you've consumed while playing it. It's even wackier than the first, so if you'd like to fill out your old SNES collection with something thats ""so bad it's good"", give Clay Fighter 2 a try."
3,Better Half,"There is no doubt Mark Doty writes beautifully, descriptive. However, the story of his loss is mired by the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the book. It focuses on other things while seeming to never have a strong focus on anything much. However, I thought the second half was well-written, and despite the sad subject, enjoyable enough to read. If the book took up fewer pages, and focused more on Doty's life with his deceased partner, and not the other people in their lives, it would have been better, in my opinion. He also has a strange obsession with the word ""commingling"" (it seems)as it shows up far oftener than necessary in the novel. I love certain words, I will admit, but there are so many in the English language, and I thought it odd he repeated this word as he did instead of choosing another once in a while."
5,Incredibly moving account of love in the age of AIDS,"Poet Mark Doty, writes a dazzling memoir of love, life, andpassion, in Heaven's Coast.His flowing prose and sense of timing, make this book hard to put down.A must read for anyone, and gay men in particular."
1,Yawn!,"I think many are swayed by the emotional impact of AIDS, to the point that they feel that Doty's story is ""profound"" or ""moving,"" but it's not. He's just some middle-class white guy who has experienced loss. Boo-hoo! For truly stunning writing about AIDS, try Thom Gunn, D A Powell, Paul Monette or Essex Hemphill."
2,A disappointment!,"The story had potential to be good but the author didn't do a very good job at piecing the plot together. I was not convinced that the heroine Ka-tien (Kathleen) truly loved the hero, her stepbrother Robert. Ka-tien ends up bedding so many men that I doubted her intelligence. What's the point? To prove that she is so desirable that any man who laid eyes on her would want to sleep with her or to show that she is just too ignorant to learn from her mistakes? In the first chapter, Ka-tien closes the door of her cabin and drops the bar to prepare for a bath. Then, guess what? Robert walks in. How did he manage to walk in through the door with the bar in place? I liked the exotic setting and the ending was quite romantic. Read this story if you're really bored. Otherwise, spend your money on a better story."
5,Shipping,"I ahve order this rifle form amazon knowing i was going to get a great deal like all the other stuff i buy off amazon. I wnet through the whole buying process. Then i had been tracking my package the whole time. I tracked it ever sice i order it and it took 8 DAYS TO GET HERE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Instead of the so called 3-5 busniess shipping so i reccomend that when u get this gun order express shipping so it comes with the 3-5 so called busniess days,"
3,Okay Gun,"My first gun.Pros-Good clip size: 25 rounds x 2 clips=50 shots.-Looks freakin' sweet!-Scope has 40 zoom.Cons-shells do not work-hard to cock (if you're ten. I'm fifteen and i don't have a prob.)-BBs shoot out of clip if peg on top of clip is not twisted properly.-Scope is to the left and down.-Scope is hard to see through with a mask. You have to cock your head.-Bipod is not as pictured! It's really big and clunky-Instruction manual is hard to understand.3/5. A fun gun, but lacking power and accuracy.Buy it? Not for this price..."
4,Review,Product was shipped expedient and came packaged well. Product itself was everthing a boy could dream off.
4,BTDT (Been there done that),"I have avoided all the ills prescribed by diesel boat sailors by being qualified on one of them before making the transistion to the nuclear boats. I was one of the guys with holes in his dungarees from the battery acid; an electrician in other words.The book took me on a journey of remembrance in the 60's. Stories of Admiral Rickover, the description of the smells, living aboard each type, some danger, the comradiere, and the common goals we all had of defending our country.The book belongs in every serious submarine library as it's the first of the class of books on the subject and probably will be the only one to seriously attempt to write about the change from diesel to nuclear subs.I wanted to rate the book a 3 because of it's size. I didn't want it to end. And also because of it reliance and interviews with too many officer types. But that was being prejudice. Dan has done a very good job and I appreciate the read.Ron Martini-www.rontini.com"
3,"Sea stories, but that's all.","As others have said, this is basically a collection of sea stories. There is very little useful history here, since the author/editor is basically just reprinting stories and interview transcripts rather than trying to put things in context. Which is fine, if all you're interested in is the ""color"" aspect. Also very few facts, but lots of opinions which have been softened by time until somehow working hellish hours week after week becomes ""the good old days"". This is possibly skewed by the fact the author chose to interview mostly high-ranking officers, who naturally had a slightly different perspective having flown in the first class section."
2,you should not need this book,"There is little here that an eBay user, buyer or seller, cannot quickly figure out. In large part because of eBay's careful design of its website.Certainly, Prince has a commonsense approach, and you can't fault his ideas. But a simpler approach may be just to buy or sell a few low priced items. From these auctions, and those of similar items, you will quickly get experience. Cheaper than shelling out for this book.Well, ok, if you really need handholding. But tips like the usefulness of providing an image of the item if you are selling it? And how to best take such (digital) photos? Mundane."
4,Neal Asher and the riddle of AI.,"This is the 3rd of the Polity series by Neal Asher. In this volume, Neal Asher delves deeper into the role of AI's in his universe. It quite enjoyabley follows the adventures of agent Cormac as he again must track down Skellor and the curse that is the Jain.By the way, do not be discouraged by the lone seller here selling the title for way too much. You can buy the book from Amazon.co.uk for far less. Asher is a british author and quite a few of his books are difficult to find stateside. A quick electronic look across the pond will offer better results."
4,"at last, fantastically applied science of fiction","+1 for bone-crunching non-stop airport loung action+1 for sizzling wit - especially the Cervantes characters+1 for total mastery of his plot-line and weaving it all together+1 for bettering Ian M Banks, Peter F Hamilton and Alastair Reynolds-1 to the publisher for NOT making clear on sleeve this was #3 in seriesBottom line: best thing to happen to Brit SciFi in light years! B"
2,Dragged-out end of a series,"First of all, if you haven't read the rest of the ""Gridlinked"" series, don't bother, this novel will be utterly incomprehensible to you. Most of the major plot points are set up in earlier books, and all (ALL) of the characterization of the major characters is set up in earlier books, leading them to drag around in this book like so many paper mache' characters. The new characters are drawn well, but it's assumed you already know the old characters, so they're just shoved around like chess pieces.Neal Asher has written a lot of good stuff, but this one is, at best, merely readable. Buy it only if you've read the previous books in the Gridlinked series and want to see how he ties up all the lagging plot points. Sorry, Neal!"
1,Pretty boring. Mostly crap.,"Superheroes escaping impossible situations. Villains dreaming up new threats. Existing threats constantly working to get enough energy to become dangerous. SSDD. Pretty boring.If not for the errant knight, this wouldn't have been worth reading."
3,It was okay.....................,"The banana flavor was a bit subdued. I should have added a 1/2 cup of mashed bananas. Yes that would have increased the carbs, but it would have made the muffins tastier."
1,The Frailty Myth,"Here's another put-down of men by using a very broad brush. I don't kow of ANY woman who was thought of as frail and delicate. Think of the early settlement of this country - or any country for that matter. Where were the ""frail"" women? During WWI and WW II, where were the ""frail women""? During the Depression, everybody struggled.I don't know. Maybe Ms Colette Dowling was born with a silver spoon in her mouth, so she grew up with priveleged women. Well, now there's a snake in there, spitting venom.She discredits herself with so many twisted, inaccurate, and half-truths, it's hard for me stay with this book.I wish I had my $20 back. Any takers? You can the book for $5, and I'll pay the postage."
1,Utter nonsense,"This is a bad book. Attempting to show that women are physically as strong as men, Ms. Dowling gives them advice that can only do them harm. To quote just one example out of several dozen: the female winner of the 1996 Boston Marathon was a German woman, Uta Pippig. Ms. Dowling praises Ms. Pippig for having won the Marathon in spite of getting her period in the midst of it. According to her,this constitutes proof that women do not have to suspend exercise owing to menstruation.What Ms. Dowling does not say is that Ms. Pippig, according to her own home page, has won no important race after 1996. Instead, she has experienced continuous health problems. In 1998 she was found guilty of taking illegal drugs that led to her being suspended from running for a period of two years.This is not only a bad book--bad on physiology, bad on history, bad on practically everything--but it offers bad advice. Don't touch it, or else you may end up with health problems like those of Ms. Pippig."
4,Good,"When I received the item, I noticed that I had been shipped an item that was open and missing parts. Within three days the company sent me a replacement. It works great."
3,Mr. BBQ Corn Basket,"This product took a little extra time to recieve because of a backorder [I believe] - which I completely understand - yet, when I did finally recieve this item, the product packaging had come loose inside the mailing box, obscuring the included corn skewers, and after thoroughly checking the entire box I was disappointed to find that only 7 of the included 8 were to be found. Considering that this item is meant to be a gift, I really wish this were not an issue that I would have to explain to its reciever, but other than that I am satisfied with everything else pertaining to this order."
2,Not for Webber style kettles,"This might work well for rectangular gas grills, I don't know because I don't use that, I use a charcoal Webber kettle (yes, I'm a charcoal snob). Imagine this basket on a round grill with the wooden handle hanging out over the edge of the grill: The inner cob will cook very fast, the outer cob not so much. To cook evenly you have to put the entire basket & handle on the cooking grate, eliminating the usefulness of the handled basket, or rearrange the cobs in the basket halfway through cooking, eliminating the usefulness of the basket entirely. It seems well constructed, it just doesn't work for my setup. Anybody want one, real cheap?"
5,easily the best book ive read.,"First off i want to start out by saying that my grandfather wrote this book. he was the most amazing man i have ever met. and everytime i read this book it makes me remember how much of an amazing man he was. the amount of love and courage that this man had is just unmessurable. i learn something new about my grandfather everytime i pick up this book. what is really left out of this book is how great my grandmother ""ginny"" is. she put up with this man for years. there arent enough stars on this review to tell you what my grandfather means to me. but this book deserves 5."
3,Just OK,I realize this book is out of print but I was a little disappointed with the condition this paperback was in when I rec'd it. My son is a firefighter and wanted to add this book to his collection so it was purchased as a Christmas gift. The book was really in pretty poor condition and I paid a lot of money for a paperback (over $60). If he didn't want it so much I definitely would have returned it.
4,Great for 4th to 6th grade student,This book is a great book for a teenager to read if they believe in superstitions or not. All around fun mystery.
5,"Great bag, easy access to all compartments","We originally received the Catini Colorado bags for a gift. The smaller tote broke (strap), so when we went to return/exchange it we saw this awesome bag. The best part about it is the flat bottom/side supports and how everything stays in place without caving into the middle. The other bag just was Messy! This bag is very well put together and it keeps it shape even if you don't have it packed full, so you can easily find everything! I can't say I'd use it for a weekend, but it is generously sized and we always take it as the MAIN diaper bag and my son is turning 2, it is still in GREAT SHAPE, looks new!"
5,Roomy and Comfortable,"I had a very hard time deciding on a diaper bag and eventually chose this one. I am very happy with it! It is big (which is why I was originally hesitant to purchase it) but have been thankful for its large size on several occasions. I love how the main zipper zips around the top making it kind of like a box (rather than a zipper across the top of the bag) and I love the comfortable shoulder strap. This bag has several handy compartments that help keep your bag organized. I only have one child (4 months old) but I imagine that once we have another, this bag will easily accomodate both kids. The only problem I have with this bag is that it doesn't fit well in most stroller baskets. Actually though, in my opinion, that is more of a problem with the strollers than it is with this bag."
3,Great Travel bag but...,"It is a great bag for traveling on a plane it fits perfectly overhead or under the seat on a plane. I had a 10 hour trip and I was good to go. However, the first and only time I used it the front zipper pocket broke. In the beginning,it wouldn't open and then it didn't close. Right now it is half way open. Overall I think it is a great travel bag for baby. I am going to return it for a new one."
5,The perfect bag for more than one child,"I bought this bag so my husband would feel comfortable walking with it. We have a one year old and a 5 week old. I can fit 2 of my 1-year olds bottles, with 2 bags of stored breastmilk in the cooler. The bag is big enough to hold extra clothing for both in the bag and diapers. Can I say I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the changing pad and its pockets?? I put the wipe case in one pocket and a few newborn diapers in the other. When we are out, I just grab the changing pad by its' handle and go to the bathroom. It makes it very convenient."
5,Satisfaction guaranteed!,"Ms Decker's voice is very calming. The hypnosis suggestions are practical and direct. The customer service offered at this company is fantastic. It is truly satisfaction guaranteed! Without a doubt, I will purchase Ms Decker's products again in the future."
1,Below a 1,"My wife, who has an interest in good historical fiction was reading this. I picked it up and started reading the section on Peter III of Russia. About 50% wrong. Then about Paul I, again, about 50% wrong. And so it went. Facts, factoids, and just plain ""stories"". Oddly, the author leaves out some juicy stuff that actually happened!"
2,Promising start - incredibly sloppy,"I thought that the book had some promise, when it started to describe how the inbreeding of the Royal houses caused a number of genetic health problems. The book quickly degenerated into a history according to rumor. The usual scandals are dredged up with no attempt to separate fact from fiction. The book then started to get sloppy, did anyone edit it? For example, in the section of Catherine the great the author states that she had three children with three different fathers. On the same page he then names the man responsible for her three children. The author also wants to cover as many people as possible so there is little depth on any one figure. It really reads like a long gossip column."
1,I am glad I didn't buy this book...,"...I found it at my local library. It's like reading news from National Enquirer! The author sounded like a cheesy tour guide:* Louis XVI was mistakenly referred to as Louis XIV's great-grandson* Louis XIV's sister-in-law was an English princess, somehow the author decided to move her birth place to Austria* Perhaps the author felt sorry for Louis XV, an only child orphaned at age two, so he made Louise de la Valliere, the well-known mistress of Louis XIV who left Versailles to become a Carmelite nun, his sister...there are just too many obvious and laughable errors, makes you wonder if the author has ever heard of the word 'Google'!"
3,"Not bad, could be better","This isn't a bad book, it does have its interesting points and is a great read for anyone interested in a behind the scenes look at royalty for the last several hundred years. Unfortunately, it tends to drag on in some parts. It also jumps around a lot, instead of a chapter for each family, it goes by subject (sex lives, cruelty, etc.), considering how many common names there are among royalty (i.e., everyone is named Henry, Louis, etc.) it makes it kind of hard to keep up with who did what to whom, with whom, for whom and so forth. It is worth the read, but if you are like me, the jumping around may turn you off."
2,What a disappointment!,"A book ruined by the author's gossipy tone and his clear prejudices against monarchy as an institution and government system. Don't expect historical accuracy here. At best, a bearable toilet reading."
1,NOT if you are a serious reader of royalty,"I am always searching for new books on Russian and English royalty from 1875 to 1940. I enjoy reading about their inner families, habits, fights etc but I want it to be true and done in a serious manner.I want to know that the author is above board and knows his facts. I didn't enjoy Royal Babylon for two reasons. One, most of the characters he wrote of I am not interested in. He went clear back into the 1600's. Two, everything was done in a flippant way, which made me doubt his accuracy. Very little on English or Russian royalty of my time period of interest."
2,Disappointing,"This book has a lot of little factual errors, that should have been caught by a good editor or fact checker. The writing is only fair-to-poor. Nothing new or interesting here, despite the ""babylon"" promised in the title."
2,"Yawn, old news","If you follow European Royalty, or know royal history, this book is nothing but a big yawn. If you are an amateur, this book may be exciting. It contains no new information, and is horribly one-sided. My advice -- don't bother. You get better coverage from the tabloids."
3,The Enquirer Meets Royal History,"A tabloid treatment of history. Don't expect any in-depth explanations of a socio-politico-historic nature, but this book is well-written for the most part, if not terribly hip on scholarship (although the medical histories of some of Europe's rulers were fascinating and frankly somewhat scary). That being said, I enjoyed reading through it in one sitting. Nice light reading, if you take it for what it is."
5,"""McCormack is a mentor for any entreprenuer!""","Self-Made in America is an amazing book that was given to me by my father. Like myself he is in the business of people management, as is any entreprenuer. Want to learn the secrets of this two time self made millionaire about motivating and keeping a happy staff? This book will show you that and much more of how this ordinary man with an extroardinary drive for success developed his business empire. It is an great book that tells John McCormack's life story of becoming a millionaire at a very young age, losing his millions and more, and how three immigrants taught him how to believe in himself and become successful again. This is a must read for young and old, read it and pass the message on!"
5,So glad to own this again.....,I first read this book in the early 90's and after some moving around I pretty much lost it. I'm so glad to have this again and am reminded why I enjoyed it so much..... The author has great insight on success and does'nt sugar coat it one bit....Jason
3,The Kids will love it!!,I can't believe they brought the care bears back. I had one when I was a child. Both my kids want one for Christmas. Get one ASAP they are a hot item for the holidays.
4,Great but need alittle change to be the best.,"first off i love BOSE i currently own 4 BOSE products headphones, earphones,Bose Companion 2,and Bose Companion 5. so I admit I am a bias. however i give these speakers a 4 star rating for a small reason i would love to see fixed. on the control pod you can only lower and rise the volume. i listen to a great deal of differant kind of music, movies, and many things on my laptop and like to lower and rise the bass level. but to do this i have to reach anound the back of the sub and after awhile it gets to be a bit annoying. aside from that these speakers are worth the money. excellent build quality. excellent sound, excellent bass. but still because of the control pod i have to give them a 4 sorry BOSE."
3,"If the USB is the way to go as the Bose tech says, I am returning this one for sure!!",I expected more when I plugged in my bose c5 to my computer.First of all I have not finished setting up my system.It didn't sound that much better to my old gigaware speaker that costed me $35.00At least not $364.00 more. NOT EVEN CLOSE!Sub Woofer did sound with more boom but it was more of noise than actual bass.2 speaker had more kick in it but maybe only worth $100.00 dollars more worth.Anything else I'll update it when it's time.Update:I found out that Bose want you to use USB cable to hook it up to your computer for your $399.00 Bose C5.If that's the case I am returning this one and look for something else.Providing that C5 is a 300Watt system I'll look for something with equal or better quality.Promptly I am taking off the one extra star I gave after hooking the system up with a rca cable.
4,Excellent,"Small enough to place in our bed room or computer room, but loud enough to have a little fun. I always like Bose, but you have to get use to no on and off switch. The control pad is alittle wierd touch, but it is user friendly. But the sound, well it is Bose, so it is great. Recommend that Families looking for a good gift to send to a loved one deployed, this would be great idea. This is Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all."
5,Bose rocks!!!,"I recently purchase the companion 5 and was totally blow away. NICE!!! Simple to hook up, and nice to look at too."
1,worked until it didn't,I bought the Bose Companion 5 to go along with my home office setup.The control puck was great to mute music when on a call and the volume control was handy.Then the bass module stopped working.The Bose support people were no help ( is it plugged in ? are you sure it's plugged in ? well it's probably not plugged in....)The troubleshooting guide isn't much better.Bose won't stand behind the product and wants me to pay as much to have it serviced as I did to buy it.I woudn't buy this again and wouldn't recommend anyone else buy it either.
1,Sounds awful,"Picked these up last night and they really sound bad. There seems to be a lot of artifacts in the sound from the digital signal processing. Also, they recommend you not separate the speakers by more than 24"". That's hard with a large monitor. The quality of materials is top notch though. I expected allot better sound quality from Bose, especially considering the price. Listening to one of my favorite CDs for about five minutes over them actually made me nauseous. I returned them to the store this morning for a full refund."
1,These speakers suck!,"I bought these speakers from the Bose website thinking that they would be great speakers for $400. They have very scratchy sound and the bass is stressed. I was going to use them for an arcade machine/jukebox and they would have been imbarrassing. I am returning them. I compared them to my THX certified logitech speakers and subwoofer and it was night and day. I thought that it might have been my computer that was causing the issues, but then I came here and noticed that a lot of people were having the same problems. DO NOT BUY THESE SPEAKERS if you are looking for good sound. You could do better with a cheap $45 set from your local Walmart... Shame on Bose for putting this crap out there!!!"
3,"Bulky, yet another no so great system from bose","I bought this long back, and am using it even now - just for the lack of time to return it. I do not like the bass that it produces, doesn't sound groovy at all and misses the 'thump'. There is a control that only kicks up the loudness of the bass but doesn't produce a clear bass sound. Coming to higher frequencies, the speakers are relatively OK. The virtual effect isn't that great as advertised. The bass module is too bulky too.For its cost, it is not worth. It is worth as much as a chinese 100 dollar 5.1 speakers."
1,Does not work with docking station,"These speakers do not work with the laptop I have. More specifically a Dell latitude D410 with docking station. it works with the just the laptop, but not through the docking station.....whacked!!!!!! So I dont know what they sound like yet???? beware that they have bugs!!!!"
1,Just awful,"When I read the reviews for this product, I noted the preponderance of very positive reviews, but also noted some of the comments in the ""1 star"" reviews. As it turns out, the negative minority hit the nail on the head with these speakers. VERY shrill and boomy, all at the same time. They murder the human voice and cannot, under any circumstances, reproduce acoustic instruments with a remotely accurate sound. No amount of equalization could save them, they just sound awful. I compared them to a pair of Altecs I have that I purchased for about $70 and the Altecs blow them away (the towers with the woofers in the base). I'm sending them back as quickly as I can. What an incredible disappointment, especially considering the price! Skip these. You can get much better sound for lots less money."
1,Let down...,I've had the Bose Companion 5 now for 1 year. For about 6 months now I either get no sound or the volume is turned way up to 10 without me even touching it. Big let down from a company like Bose. Going back to Klipsch.
2,Was great...while it worked.,"I had these for a little over a year and really loved them...until they stopped working.It's now 6 months past the 1-yr warranty and they quit. You can plug in headphones and still hear music, but nothing will come out of the speakers anymore. I've tried on multiple computers to see if it was a driver issue, and even tried with just a stereo aux input - nothing. So now it's a $400 paperweight. :("
1,"Useless item, terrible tech support","My Companion 5 speakers have been sitting around for 4 months because one day all of a sudden the speakers stop working and give me a Code 43 USB error. I've tried all the solutions I could to get it working but with no success, I finally decide to call BOSE. Their tech support is incredibly useless since it sounds like they're all trained to protect the credibility of BOSE products rather than helping customers to get their items working. My response for the problem? There's nothing wrong with the speakers it's your computers problem. Good Bye. Seriously? Just a fair warning to future owners."
2,"Great sound, static sucks","I bought this expensive high end speaker system for my office, at first I was stunned at the high quality sound these speakers offer however after a while it started making blips and noises in the middle of playing music and it was getting worse, so I returned the speakers to Bose (a 2-3 week process) and now my new speakers Bose sent me give me the same static, I wish there was no static so I can enjoy the music but unfortunately it looks like I'll have to return this 2nd system to."
1,what a disaster,"These speakers have been nothing but trouble. Bose does not have it's own USB driver for these speakers and the speakers periodically stop working. Also, the sound is very shaky and not always clear. I would highly recommend to look at speakers that use a sound input as opposed to USB. Unless, of course, Bose created their own driver that fixed these issues...."
1,Junk do not buy.,At first I loved these speakers. I loved the volume control with mute. It is right by my mouse. Just tap it and it mutes. I have had these speakers for less than a year and they hiss horribly. At the very lowest volume in the mid range they will hiss like they are blown. My wife is in my office with me so I can not play them very loud. Poor quality product. I would avoid.
1,nasty and fatiguing,"Holy mackeral, I was stunned by how brittle, tinny the sound was from these satellites. Exhausting to listen to. I cannot say enough bad things about these. (FYI, I listen to classical and, yes, they were working properly). AVOID!!!"
2,"Baaaad, worst bose product ever.","The Companion 5 speakers are the worst bose speakers ever. How can they say you can get the same sound from a 5 channel speakers in this 2.1 speaker system. At high volumes, the bass sounds terrible, people are surprised that there is so much sound comming from these small speakers..its fake!!! Thats why the subwoofer aka ""Acoustimass module"" is sooo huge, because it does the work the satellite speakers should. When listening to stereo music, they sound terrible. When listening to a DVD, they sound ok, at low volume. Oh and one more thing, to take advantage of the ""faux surround sound"" you must stand dirrectly in front of them. Definetly not worth 400 dollars. I don't own then, I would never own a bose product, waste of money. I work at a store where hey sell them, and they suck!"
3,Good But WAY overpriced,"I am a very picky person when it comes to things like this. I agonized over which computer speaker system to buy and spent way to much time in retail stores listening to everything I could.The Bose Companion 5 sounds very good, and looks nice, but there were a few other systems that I can honestly say sounded just as good, and perhaps better for about half the price. And other systems that sounded about 80 percent as good for much less than half the price. Don't be hosed by Bose. Don't think you are getting what you pay for. While Bose wants you to think their stuff is worth the premium, I just can't justify it. You can do just as good for a lot less money."
1,Bose Control Pod Expensive,"This system has a very nice sound. But it comes at a steep price. I would also suggest that you don't allow the Bose Control Pod to sit on the same surface you use for any sort of drink. Even a small amount of liquid on the surface of this device and it will stop working. Your 400 dollar sound system will not work. And replacing this little devil will cost you 91 dollars through the Bose Service Center 1-800-367-4008. Replacement of the pod for the Bose Companion Three is different and ""only"" 41 dollars.One thing about Bose. They see far into the future. The future of sound. And the future of inflation."
1,phony sound,"I'm afraid I must second the negative comments of a previous reviewer. I listen exclusively to classical music and I want accuracy of sound. I do not want a souped-up acoustic, with added resonance and bass, that makes the music sound muddy and artificially plush rather than clear. I'll definitely stick with my Monsoons, which according to the Wikipedia article about them are (justifiably) something of a cult for their ""incredible sound and accuracy."" Why pay $400 for an inferior product? I'm returning the Bose."
5,NOT Disappointed,I had read some bad reviews and went ahead and purchased anyways. I am 100% satisfied with the product. I was even more impressed with the fact that the USB cable from the sub to the PC was included. Great small stereo set up for a small TV or computer set up.
1,RCA Jacks are cheap,I have had two of these Bose Companion systems and both times one of the jacks in the back stopped working and only one speaker would work. I will never buy one of these again.
5,What I think about Bose,Fantastic sound Great blend of highs and midrange Really nice bass responce You can control how little or how much bass you like.Sounds great at low or high volume Fills the entire room with sound. Easy setup easy to operate.Best speakers I ever owned. Thumbs up BOSE
5,Bose Companion 5 multimedia speaker system review,"The sound is excellent, even on a Youtube video. I tried it out with a DVD watching part of Lethal Weapon with an action scene, sounded like a home theatre system since it plays Dolby 5.1 - great product - would recommend to anyone looking for a great computer speaker for any application"
5,<3,Love the speaker!!! The speaker is really really awesome! You guys should all buy it!It's incredible and I love it!
2,"if you're planning on listening to music, stay away.",These speakers aren't worth the price of admission. I found them to be very very heavy on the low end and i also found vocals to be drowned out. I tested them out on a variety of musical genre's and was not satisfied.
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!,"I am a DJ and Amateur Producer. I use all Yamaha and Mackie gear for my gigs and needed something smaller for my home studio to use on my laptop. I use Yamaha HSM50's for mixing on my main desktop and didn't want to constantly hook them up between both systems, so I went down to the local Bose store and tried the Companion 3's and 5's. After about 2 minutes of listening I grabbed the 5's and brought them home. They sound amazing! They produce nice full sound, strong base, and my mixes sound as good as they do on my 3500 watt pro system I use for live gigs. All of my house mixes, disco, rock and pop sound great!I am really impressed, my hats off to Bose!Buy them...you wont be disappointed!!"
1,Power Bright's VC750W Voltage Transformer,"Just received the unit via Federal Express.I opened the box and immediately noticed the un-raveled electrical cord. I then removed the unit itself from the product box & plastic bag/sleeve and immediately noticed scratches on the top of the unit.I further inspected the unit and discovered additional scratches along with dents, obvious dust/caked dust in corners and previous wear and use markings.There was also a plethora of smudges and finger prints.This unit is not new and seems to be previously used, refurbished or a floor model. I wish this information would have been disclosed prior to my purchasing this item. This is UNACCEPTABLE and I am quite displeased with this Amazon.com purchase.NOTE: I will provide additional comments once I use and test the quality of this unit."
2,i don't like it,ita was bro...!! i don't like it power bright vc 750w voltaj transformer 750 w step up/down 110 v was broken.
1,I would give no Stars,Do not buy. It can not work fuse connection was ripped of on the inside on 2 units. needed them quick so i had to fix them on my own.
4,Great album,"If you think you know everything about jewish music, Golem will prove you wrong. It is not an homogeneous album though - it's got its ups and downs. But though some songs are only average, the songs that are good are *REALLY GOOD*. If you want to sample it, buy Odessa, a very energetic piece. If you like it, buy the rest of the album. You can't go wrong."
5,"Sugar, Salt and Everything Sea","There are so many uses for this one item. The scrub gently polishes away dead skin cells and this scrub can be used in the shower, bath (especially with the Zia sea mineral soak) or just for your hands and feet during a pedicure/manicure session.If your hands feel very dry from winter, then keep this by the sink and give yourself a nourishing massage. Follow with Zia body butter and your hands will feel renewed, luxuriously soft and comforted. This product seems to work best on damp skin.Ingredients: Sea salt, safflower oil, brown sugar, soybean oil, sunflower oil, organic clover honey, glycerin, almond glycerides, sea kelp and sea algae extracts, tocopheryl acetate, retinyl palmitate, methylparaben, propylparaben, benzoin gum.~The Rebecca Review"
4,Tilt - Play Cell: Great Voice & Lyrics,"Tilt a great punk band with intelligent lyrics and a great singer (Cinder Block).. if you like this band it's a must have..I especially like the songs ""Crying Jag"", ""Play Cell"", ""Fool to Blame"", ""Yellow Bellies"" and ""Idiot Lips"". 8-)"
3,bit above average Regency....,"Pretty good Regency. Overall, a satisfying ""down to Earth"" Romance. In this story it's the heroine who is wealthy and the hero is poor. Marriage of Convenience storyline. Could have had more romance and less disagreements, but still enjoyable if you're looking for a Regency that deals more with everyday life than routs and balls. Half the story is in London and half is ""back home"" at the Earl's estate in Ireland. 3.5 stars."
3,"I love live albums, but not this one","Live albums are where talented bands shine - unfortunately maybe I was going into this disc with the wrong mind-set. Jonathan Mover seems as though he's trying to turn the songs into prog-rock/metal showcases and he overdrums and overfills and over double-bass drum kicks throughout. Max Bacon whose vocals and melodies are what help make the studio album brilliant has changed most of the melodies and thus left me flat - not just because I wanted to hear him pull off those great parts live, but because the new way doesn't seem to fit the songs. Hackett & Howe are brilliant as usual. I was excited to hear this disc after enjoying the studio lp, cassette then cd for the better part of 17 years but this left me wanting to put this back on the shelf and only pull out when the studio disc was unavailable...."
4,Very Good,"I was able to get a copy of this on CD last year and what a nice CD. I have this (KBFH) and the first CD by the band GTR as well. I have the (KBFH) available with the artwork on a CDR as well as their 1st cd. And many other titles with the artwork in perfect condition, as well. If anyone is interested, Very reasonable. Just e-mail me at shane.bush@us.heidelberg.com or at shane_bush@hotmail.com Hope to hear from you very soon."
4,Excellent for Howe/Hackett/Guitar Lovers,"To truly enjoy this music one must understand one thing. This was little more than an experiment for two legendary guitarists. Great musicians often find inspiration in working with other (often young) tallented musicians. In this CD we find a wonderful example of just that. This is not YES or GINISES, it is a wonderful and fresh experiment by two fantastic guitarists. Those who are over-analysing this music are missing the point. If you are capable of appreciating what this kind of effort means, you'll love this CD. WHRTM is fantastic. The vocals are powerful, the guitar is inspriing, and bottom line, it is just one great song. ""Hackett To Bitz"" is killer. Listen and enjoy, but only if you can truly appreciate what this CD is about."
5,Master storyteller at his best.,One of my favorite books of all time. Reading it may make you feel very random at parts and it may make no sense to some readers but Murakami's ability to keep you interested and turning to the next page is truly remarkable. I do highly recommend this book and some of his other works as well.
3,First book by this author that I could not finish,"I made it to about 50 pages from the end, but there just wasn't enough to sustain my interest. For the last half of the book I found myself losing interest in the characters and their fates. This is the fifth book of Murakami's that I have read, and the first that I could not finish. Obviously he has the skill and creativity to engage a reader's interest, and I was fascinated by aspects of the story, such as ""Johnny Walker"" but towards the end I just didn't care."
3,If David Lynch wrote a long philosophical essay,"This was certainly a compelling read though, upon reaching the end, a significant source of disappointment as the various lines of surrealism are never reconciled with each other and with the overall plot. In this sense the novel is much like an extended dream sequence, with magical elements that are unexplained and don't follow the laws of cause and effect (Nakata must get to Takamatsu, but when he does his task upon arriving there is rather pedestrian and the novel is not at all clear as to why he is the one who needs to complete it. And whatever happened to Nakata in his childhood, anyway? And who killed who?). Reminiscent of David Lynch's Lost Highway.On the other hand, certain characters hold forth on the philosophy of life as though reading from their graduate school essays.Despite these complaints, the novel is quite enjoyable, particularly if one doesn't hope to understand it all by the end."
5,love it.,"Murakami is a genius, and this book is but one tiny shred of evidence. I have heard rumors that he may win the nobel prize for literature (for IQ84, I'm assuming?)The mystery he creates is so amazing and it is just delightful to push your brain to pick it all a part. It was an absolutely beautiful story about essentially not being able to run or hide from your past. It is a shame more people do not read Murakami. I walk out into a Starbucks right now and ask each person inside if they had heard of him, and I doubt I would find a single one. But, anyone fortunate enough to be turned onto reading Murakami will quickly recognize they are experiencing the work of a true artist. I am so grateful that he exists."
3,A ragged quilt,"This is an odd volume. I'm not sure what else to say given the fact that the opening pages dwell on a mysterious incident that occurred to a group of students in Japan during World War II, but the subsequent 400 pages never get around to explaining the reason behind that event. If the definition of ""post-modern novel"" means that the author is free to write about anything that strikes his or her fancy -- such as talking cats, overlapping worlds, long, black, snake-like objects coming out of dead people's mouths -- without feeling the compunction to explain why, than I may need to run screaming back to the Dickens and Hardy section of the library immediately. I fully appreciated Murakami's scene-setting capabilities. There were several pages that read beautifully. I was fully engaged within individual chapters and sections of the book. But as an entity, this novel suffered from the lack of anything that may have resembled a motive or a sense of closure."
3,Same as the old boss,"All of Murakami's books, including this one, reads the same. They all have the same plot-line, characters, monsters, dream-like sequences, isolated dwellings, etc. Having said that, I will continue to read Murakami, because his books are better than most. The wonder and amazement I felt after reading my very first Murakami, The Wind-up Bird Chronicle, has long since dissipated, but I still feel an old twinge of it from time to time since I intersperse them out with other books."
2,Kitchen Sink Story,"Two stars for good intentions. I had high hopes for this work when some intriguing trails captured my attention, but there was absolutely no arrival on any point. Murakami leads his readers up a scrubby slope then deserts them. Worse, he has his pedantic characters deliver mind-numbing philosophical lectures to each other in just about every scene. It was like Murakami revisited every aha moment in his own life and regurgitated it on the page for his readers to lap up. The book was full of cliches, boring dialogue, stolen ideas and achingly slow character development. He tossed everything but the kitchen sink into this story and was unable to present anything palatable. Instead of tossing this book aside, I finished it. I just couldn't believe how bad it was. It's possible Murakami was screwed by his translator, too. It really was that bad."
2,Not worth the effort...,"I was less than impressed - after all the hype. I may try this author's earlier work as they are so highly recommended, but I hope they offer plots I can follow - and which may exhibit some cause and effect - rather than this seemingly random grab-bag of half dream half possibly real events... The author seems obsessed with Kafka's sexuality: yet I gained the odd view that the boy Kafka was in fact more mature than his literary creator - and quickly lost interest in the book... It's a book I am most unlikely to finish, and that really annoys me as I hate leaving books half read."
4,Kafka Among Murakami's Best,Murakami does it again with Kafka on the Shore. He can take the most surreal experiences and make them seem so believable. The psychology of his novels is always the most intriguing aspect and this book joins with The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and Hard-Boiled Wonderland as among his best.
2,Harry Potter for grown ups?,"Am I the only one who finds it rather childish?Like so much Japanese literature/film/animation/stories it seems yet again the magical tale of a gifted child with exceptional powers of bravery, strength and vision, who no one else appreciates, but who will burn through in the end.For a smart guy, Murakami needs to challenge himself a bit more."
3,Similiar to his other novels. He is the Japanese Dan Brown.,"I thought it was an ok novel but if you read this one you have read most of his other novels. It seems he takes the same story and replaces the characters names and locations and he has a new novel. He is the Japanese version of Dan Brown. But if one wants to read a Haruki Murakami this is the one to choose in, my opinion it seems somewhat deeper and filled with symbolism.If you own a kindle do not buy this novel, instead I suggest downloading Calibre-Library and going to ebookee (.) com and downloading it. Calibre will do the rest."
5,Murakami Again,"Like other books by Murakami, it is a striking combination of 'everyday' with pure fantasy. Keeps interest throughout with building character development and unpredictable plot twists. Fun reading."
4,Interesting,"This story doesn't really hold up in my opinion. It's also a little silly in its style here and there, but I like it still. I love the local feeling conveyed, and I do enjoy the outlines of the story. Just a little too pieced-together."
3,On the fence,"This was my second Murakami book, after The Wind up Bird Chronicles- which I really liked. Kafka on the Shore was a good read, but I didn't love it. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it stayed a constant ""good""...i'd recommend this book though, as it was pretty enjoyable. There are multiple story-lines going on in this book, which are all related in some way. I liked this aspect because it made the book more interesting and had me constantly turning the pages."
5,Wonderful!,"Not everyone's cup of tea, but Kafka on the Shore is a magical read: taking the reader on quite a strange and enchanting journey, filled with rich and engaging characters that makes one look within as well.Wonderful read for those who like something different."
2,"Pretentious, self-indulgent rubbish","Don't waste your time reading this tripe. I suggest you try Wind Up Bird Chronicle, which is quite a decent, if rather twisted, read, then give up on Murakami completely."
3,wellll,"Much better than Murakami's South of the Border, West of the Sun (in my opinion).It's difficult to say how I feel about this book. At times I was enthralled and plot twists literally made me gasp or laugh out loud. But at times I found myself saying ""gimme a break."" I think this is because the novel is extremely surreal, in a way that broke down at times. I like this novel because it is different from any other book I've read recently in many ways. But it only gets three stars because it could have been a lot better, in terms of character development, plot manueverings, and minimizing the awkwardness associated with on again off again sentimentality/surrealness.Overall, I'd recommend at least giving it a try."
3,Kafka is a bore,"Repetitive, and simplistic, wistful and dreamlike this book just made me want to get it over and done with.It was at least an improvement on IQ84 which was an insult to my intelligence. There must have been at least 300 mentions of the main characters name per chapter!!!!Cmon."
3,Anything new ?,"With a lot of fuzz about Mr. Murakami's new book, IQ84 I read about it on reviews in Amazon.com. A recommandation was not to start up with the 1Q84 as the first book to read from the writer, Murakami. So I purchased ""Kafka on the shore"".The book is OK. 2 plots are followed and in the end they merges as it is modern now. The book is well written easy to understand for me having english as my second language.One thing I had hoped for with a japanese writer was an introduction to the japanese way of life, but either the way of thinking in Japan is the same as in Europe or the book is written for a western public. There are referrals to european thinkers and philosofers and to the old greece. depus made a round in the theater also."
4,Ending fell apart for me,"I have to agree with the other reviewers. This is not the best Murakami to start with if you are unfamiliar with his work. Try The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles instead if you are a Murakami newbie.That said, this novel is still absorbing and amazingly written. Who, but the great Haruki Murakami, could make a pimp named Colonel Sanders, fish falling from the sky, a woman who is a ghost of herself, all work as plot elements?My biggest problem with this novel was the ending. It was ultimately unsatisfying. There were too many loose ends. Without spoiling the ending, the story of the killing wasn't really resolved and I still wasn't clear on exactly what happened.This is a good choice for Murakami fans, but again, try The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles if you are still among the SADLY uninitated!"
4,Kafka on the Shore,"This book is a real page turner, kept me thinking about what had happened and how it figured into what happens next. the down fall was the last few chapters- became too over the top for most."
5,A Surreal Journey,A very haunting resonant read. Murakami creates a dreamscape that grabs the reader and doesn't let go.
3,Imaginary world of Murakami,"This is my first encounter with Haruki Murakami-a popular writer of many bestselling ""page turners"" where facts and fiction skilfully intermingle.I like the imaginary world of Chagall or Gabriel Garcia Marquez ,but Kafka on the shore ,even if entertaining , disappointed me.The plot and the characters have to be believable even in the supernatural world, and here the vagaries of the plot and the wild actions of the protagonists peppered with unnecessary pornography (yes,not eroticism) turned me off ,but I can think of many readers who will find the swift action and the wild imagination of the author quite enjoyable . I may even try another sample of Murakami on a long airplane trip."
5,Read AT LEAST 3 times!,"I won't bore you with the details that dozens of other reviews mention. Instead, if you are a fan of Murakami, read this book several times. Each time is a little different and you pick up on metaphors, symbols, and events that you might have missed the first or second time through. Even Murakami himself says to read multiple times (on his website). Highly recommended as an intelligent, modern twist on Oedipus Rex.I know a lot of people complain that there are thematic elements here that appear in many other Murakami works, and I wholeheartedly agree. But I am praising this as a stand alone novel and a great introduction to Murakami. This is not as subtle and complex as his other works, but reading this before diving into others is recommended."
2,Adequate,"Read The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle instead. Murakami's latest novel is certainly readable, in the sense that a very cheap wine is ""drinkable"", but it is also bottomlessly self-indulgent. Murakami writes very well, but he is not writing about much of anything in Kafka on the Shore. Empty and dull."
3,For Murakami devotees only,"I have read a few Murakami novels, and I have to admit a bit of disappointment with this one. In this work it is as if he wrote a novel which is clearly centered around some mystical phenomenon that unites the experience of all the principal characters, then edited out all direct references to it, leaving only a shell around it. The rest of us us can only guess as to how all the various strands of narrative tie together. The effect is more enigmatic but less haunting than in, say, Hard-Boiled Wonderland.However, the tone is somewhat warmer than his other works, and does not suffer from the lack of his usual disaffected 30-something male protagonist. The tale and the characters themselves are quite engaging and enjoyable during the read. It only really suffers in its paucity of closure.If you like his work and enjoy the idea of puzzling out the possibly non-existent substance behind an ethereal tale, by all means check it out."
4,a book of riddles,"This was the first book of Haruki Murakami that I read. It is clear to see why he is the most popular Japanese writer outside of Japan. John Updike described the book as a ""real page-turner, as well as a metaphysical mind-bender"". I agree. Although the later part of the book seemed to drag a bit, perhaps because of mundane detail. On the other hand, the way Murakami bends popular culture, magical realism, suspense humor, and sexuality was brilliant. I also enjoyed the emphasis on Japanese religious traditions, particularly Shinto. Next up, I want to read 'Norwegian Wood'."
5,Excuse me while I go read everything he's ever written,"I don't know when I last read a book that had me so enthralled I snuck it into tech rehearsals and got up early to read whole chapters. Kafka on the Shore is a bit like a cross between Salman Rushdie, David Lynch, and the last ten minutes of ""Magnolia."" It was my first Murakami book and I can't wait to read another."
4,an excellent novel,"I am really enjoying reading this novel. I haven't read any of Murakami's other novels, but this one is hard to put down. Murakami's writing, while not sophisticated or erudite, is forboding and always keeps you below the surface, wondering how the adventures of Kafka and Nakata will end up. While the plot twists are sometimes farcical, for example Johnnie Walker the cat-killer asking for death, Murakami is able to weave a tapestry of suspense and redemption that keeps the novel going and keeps it believable. Through Kafka, he creates a reality not unlike the metamorphosis, in which the whole world tilts on its side and nothing seems real anymore. The only negative aspect I've found is making Kafka and Oshima talk like university professors. They seem to be too young to engage in such intellectual dialogue. But it's a great read anyway."
2,Very Disappointing,"I tried to like this book i honestly did. I had heard great things and thought this would be for me, but ultimately it drove me nuts. I have no problems with complicated and surreal narratives, but with this book the whole thing just seemed pointless. It's not that i didn't GET the point, i just didn't see the need for the journey to wander so aimlessly along to get there (and with so much repetition and mundane characters)I only finished this book to finish it. I shant be reading anymore Murakami - enough said."
4,Seems to be of a good quality.,"Never really used it, but it had a perfect fit on the phone and it seemed like it was very well made."
4,Good for what it is;software is...trying,"I haven't used this much lately, but every time that I do it's worked just fine.The OpemMG software is annoying because you are forced into atrac conversions, but besides that, this thing's durable and has lasted without ANY flaws with the player."
4,Durable But Not Very Compact,"The Song MZ-S1 MD Player is very durable indeed. It would probably survive a 4-foot drop. However, at over 7 oz., it is not very compact. It weighs more than my CD Player! If you are looking for durability, this is the one for you because not will it survive through the harshest of falls, it is also water-resistant. But, if you are looking for something tiny, I reccomend getting a Network MP3 Player. The MZ-S1 is very . . . chunky. I would reccomend getting it if you play sports often, or if it is for someone irresponsible. (i.e. you teenage son or husband =])"
4,great option for runners,"yes, the MZ-S1 is heavier than most newer MD players. and yes, it's pretty bulky. but if what you want is a functional player to carry with you while you run, this is a great product. once you figure out how to use the strap, you can run without clinging to the player-- it feels very natural in your hand. contrary to what other reviewers have said, i find using the joystick controller very natural; it's great to be able to control volume without feeling for the remote, or for a dial somewhere on the player. also, it NEVER skips. the player i used to run with was slightly smaller but less sturdy, and i had to spend way too much time worrying about holding my arm steady in order to keep it from skipping.[note: i have not (and will not-- i use another program that works fine) used the software that comes with the player, so i can't comment on it. i also never use the headphones that come with audio equipment, so i can't comment on them, either.]"
4,if they only could have....,"its features are all great w/ the exception of the fact that it can't have a mike directly plugged into to record. that is one my main uses for concerts and things as such. you can record however if you go through another analog device , but its a pain."
3,"Overall good, but very expensive","This is a good MD player. I love its heavy construction,and lit display screen. The toggle switch is a bit hard to use while recording, recording itself is a bit difficult!I do not use the Open MG/supersonic program, BEWARE it embeds something into your computer that messes up your mp3's.Instead i bought a cable to connect it to my cd player, casset tape player and radio. This works well, but takes out some quality in the sound. Its nice to merge 3-4 cds on one minidisc.I don't think of this as a alternative to a cd player, but as a alternative to a tape recorder because I don't use the software."
1,blank disc issue,"in case you have not read many postings on this issue, there is a risk of your unit not working after the warranty expires. I bought my Sony sports MD player over a year ago and it has suddenly stopped recording. There are dozens of postings at the following link complaining about Sony MD's, i would check it out before you buy this product. Sony's response has been almost non-existent and most people are having to pay around 100 bucks to repair.http://www.musiclub.sonystyle.com/community/thread.jsp?forum=4&thread;=16873andy"
4,Very Good Player that will do it's job,"I received this minidisc player a couple of years ago as a bday present and it hasn't let me down yet. Sound quality is clear as CDs. Easy and simple to use with a joystick to use as the button to play/stop/ff/rew. With the software (SonicStage), I can get over 30 songs on a single disc. Doesn't eat up batteries so don't worry about that. My only problem with the product is the bulky size which doesn't allow for simple transportation. Other then that, very good and useful player."
3,Sony is a record company too,"As far as a piece of hardware goes, it's great. I'm in the military and mine has led a very hard life without a glitch. Batteries last a very long time. Controls are easy to use, particularly the thumbstick.Music reproduction is extremely good.The Open MG software that comes with the device is not so great. Everytime you burn something onto an MD you have to leave a copy on your hard drive for rights management. I just bought my first copy-protected CD that used Windows Media Toolkit encryption (XP and Media Player 9 users lookout!) and Open MG can't read it worth a damn. If the Windows Media Toolkit encryption becomes popular (Virgin seems to like it) the device will soon be useless."
5,OUSTANDING PRODUCT,"Whoever has previously written any kind of negative review regarding this product obviously had problems of some sort trying to use it. I bought this as a christmas present for my boyfriend, and he is not computer literate so he had trouble trying to figure it out. But I did not! As soon as the software was loaded on to our computer, the ripping of songs off of discs we already had and recording onto the MD was EASY!!!! Not to mention it's water proof, and my boyfriend plans to use this solely for snowboarding! It doesn't skip!! We tried hitting it while it was playing and it did nothing to the way the song was playing. Not to mention it's light, and compact. Anyone who is anyway computer literate can figure out how to use this, it's fast, friendly and most of all FANTASTIC!!!"
4,A great machine but not the best,"I've bought one of this Net MDs a few months ago, and I gotta say that it's a really great machine. You can store almost 320 minutes (more than 5 hours) in only one MD. I've got only 5 MDs and I've got all the songs I wanna listen to in a long trip.I usually have long trips and only one AA battery gives me the best of my music. The orange light of the screen is one of its best features, that's something that not all the MDs have neither the most expensive model. I really like its modern design and its reflective smoke withe is something nice.But nothing is perfect. The weight is its weak point. I gotta wear a jacket to carry it easily, because it cannot be carried in the shirt pocket, hardly in the jean pocket.Despite that thing, I recommend this MD, I'm satisfied with it and you'll surely be too."
5,very handy,"I bought this of may 2003 because i wanted to use it to go to iraq with. its great for that, it doesnt skip and doesnt get dirty. Now i can play the drums and play along to music so i can learn the beat with louder headphones of course. but that is extremely kool. I cant wait to use it for snowboarding, i have a feeling I will be keeping this player for years to come!!!"
2,"Good hardware, frustrating software","I hvae been using this and the earlier version (MZ-NE410). Unit is much less sensitive to vibration than a CD player and works well. The software is another matter. Nearly worthless. I have many CDs I can't import via Sonic stage and no reason why. I've tried on both an XP and earlier win2000, 98 but the software is just as unpredictable on the earlier systems. Sony is apparently moving to yet a higher density format with newer models. Hope they improve the software otherwise you won't be able to use all that additional space."
1,Read the packaging really close....,"and you'll still probably miss it. If your computer's OS is an upgrade from the 'factory installed' OS (i.e. from Win 98 to ME), the enclosed software will not run on your computer. It states it in nice big letters within the installation booklet, but not on the packaging. If you mosey on over to Sony's web site to try and find a patch to correct this problem, you're out of luck as their web site is about as illuminating as the vague information located on the product packaging. I was so so looking forward to running with this player, instead back to the store it goes to be replaced by something hopefully better designed."
5,Cheer Bear!,I love Cheer Bear! She is my favorite! The video that comes with this toy is educational because it shows how you should ask for help when you need it and not just go on without it when you really need it. I love it!
5,I love cheer bear and all care bears,"This care bear is wonderful l bought lt and l love it so much l cant wait to get wish bear who is cheer bears best friend and love-alot bear who is cheer bears sister if anyone wants to get a care bear l suggest u get cheer bear, wish bear, love-alot bear, bedtime bear, grumpy bear, and tenderheart bear."
3,"Good for a collection,but not 12 year old meterial to play","This is a cute toy,but press it's tummy and it won't shut-up!This is a good toy for 2-8 year olds,but for 12 year olds,it's downright embarrassing!I do like the fact that one girl has a collection that she brings to cheeraledding practice.But I would reccomend a Care Bear if it doesn't talk!Though if the kids in my fifth grade had a choice to compare the talking Cheer Bear to a Transformer,evan as a women whatchagonna go for?The Transformer!"
4,"Very funny read, but...","This book was quite ammusing and I did enjoy it. My only problem with this book is that C.D. Payne has women characters that are somewhat vindictive and very manipulative. I found the characters in civic beuties to be a little to manipulative. I would recommend this book, but with a condition...READ YOUTH IN REVOLT FIRST, so you can see this author at his very best."
5,"remarkable characters, unique story.","Although the background of this story is American politics, one need not know anything, or be interested in politics to enjoy this book. A joyous read for teenagers or adults, though more for the female readers, this book follows twin teenage girls with contrasting persona's, and their whimsical friends who you either hate or love from the very first introduction. C D Payne is a master at capturing the reader from the starting line of his novels, and never allows any boredom. Some authors go into great detail to describe the exact particular spring morning, this you will not find, and Paynes language is uniquely creative, and mindbogglingly cool but not aimed at visualizing a tree, but at the fantastic characters, and the inside of their idiosyncratic minds, and their absurd surroundings. A terrific read, equally good as Youth in Revolt, a sort of female version of Nick Twisp, and very sexy book too."
3,Disappointing,"I loved ""Youth in Revolt"" and ""Revolting Youth"", and so I guess I had very high expectations of this book. After only about 50 pages I found myself struggling to continue. It isnt a bad book, but is definitely missing something when you compare it to the brilliance of the aforementioned titles."
4,C.D. Payne does it again,"The musical novel Civic Beauties is another great sucess for C.D. Payne. These book has Payne's origanal humor applied to poltics. I looked at the cover of this book after I finished because Payne does such a great job of writing from the prespective of a teen ager female. I encourage all to invest in Civic Beauties, if not cause it's great. But to support C.D Payne"
2,Forgettable ...,"There must be better examples of Brazilian Pyschadelic music out there but, if so, they certainly are not in this collection. However, I highly recommend the Turkish and Asian versions ... fantastic."
3,Deep Southern whackos,"Twisted Southern gothic, this time with Rastas. Crews' usual gang of swampland nutjobs trying in whacked-out ways to make sense of things. The writing is slow-moving in parts, which only underscores the boggy, ganja-filled world of death and magic. Tries a little too hard to work the ""scars"" theme throughout. Not my favorite Crews book but better than meh. Try Feast of Snakes if you're looking for an intro to his writing."
1,Terrible Inconsistent Photos,"Got this camera a couple of years ago. It has been bad from the start. A lot of photos turns the subject (person) into a ghost. Their faces turn bright white rendering the photo itself useless. I have tried every concveivable setting and even if I am in the same light with the same setting, same distance, etc. The photos will be completely different. One decent and the other turning the person into a glowing white ghost. Shutter time is eternal ruining any GOOD candid shots you might have gotten. Kids get impatient waiting for it to take the photo. Both of these problems render it useless in it's purpose. Taking pictures and capturing memories."
3,A worthwhile noir. . .,"""Love Walked In"" is a pleasant surprise: a genuine film noir done 90's style (which IS to say less effective, but I digress). Denis Leary, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, and the always interesting Terence Stamp all contribute strong performances in a tale that comes across as a MUCH more interesting version of ""Indecent Proposal"". I'd rate it a ""B"". Worth checkin' out."
3,Dennis Leary Makes It Worth A Try,"While not totally satisfying, Love Walked In is still quite watchable. The film skirts on the boundaries of film noir but never really goes there. Still there is an interesting unpredictability that carries through to the very end. Denis Leary is certainly not a great actor, but he often chooses interesting roles and he has a certain edginess and inner violence ready to explode that keeps the audience off balance wondering what he will do and/or say next. He uses that characteristic to very good effect in this film. Definitely worth a try."
3,Great Place To Start,This book is very good for a starting point and covers many areas of Telecommunications along with look into complete cost savings of your Telecommunications. You can get some great information from this book. Most companies find it is too hard to even attempt to decifer their Telecom bills let alone perform and audit to try and find cost savings. Read this book; if that doesn't work for you call a local Telecom professional to help you. You can find brokers these days to do all this for no charge to you.
3,3.5 Stars,"I had a little trouble figuring out how I wanted to rate this product. In truth, the Pimsleur language lessons DO WORK. I found that even after a couple of weeks had gone by without listening to a CD, I still retained everything I had heard. These lessons work through pure rote memory and I guess this is my problem with them. The repetition gets boring and redundant and makes me want to turn them off after about 15 minutes. Having experience with languages (and having always done very well with languages), I find I prefer visual imagery and reading accompaniment WITH audio for the best possible benefit. As far as these lessons go, it is 90% audio, so while one may learn how to have a conversation, writing in the language would be nearly impossible (unless perhaps one has a background in Spanish or Portuguese...as they are similar in many ways).Do the lessons work? Yes, they do. Could the program be made more exciting and engaging? Definitely."
4,Easy way to learn Italian,"Lessons are in 30 minute increments with pronunciation drills by native speakers. The format is sample conversation spoken at normal speed, pronunciation practice with individual words, stringing various words into a sentence and finally speaking the entire diaglogue at the end of the lesson. The material moved at a good pace - not too fast and not too slow to ensure comprehensive without risking boredom. I was pretty impressed that I can speak a few sentences after just 30 minutes. The only thing that they can make better is to provide a book with the Italian words and sentences covered during the lesson. This would further boost the learning process as one would be seeing as well as speaking the language."
3,Logical but Boring,"This reminded me of high school language lab way back in the 60's. You listen, repeat, listen again, repeat again... You need to be highly motivated to stick with this and stay awake.On the plus side, the sentences start out with very useful ones if you plan to visit Italy, such as Italian for ""Excuse me, do you understand English.""The Pimsleur Method for Italian I concentrates on an oral approach, with no written material for the first 8 units, and minimal written vocabulary after that. I found this way of learning to be difficult and gave up before getting that far. I need visual cues to keep learning organized in my brain; however, some people are more verbally oriented and might find the Pimsleur method enjoyable."
4,fun,"Obviously oriented toward men on the prowl, this is nevertheless a fun/ny way to learn a language. It is focused on learning conversation, such as beginning with ""hello."" Many of the scenarios are focused on a man picking-up a woman, sometimes aggressively/annoyingly so, but stops short of asking her to go to bed. In the scenarios, at least the woman frequently holds her own. I wouldn't consider this as an only source in learning a language, but it does help you to communicate quickly."
3,"runs good, but hard to assemble","Well, I haven't got a chance to use the saw alot yet. It seems to run great, but the assembly was challenging. The pulleys would not align. I called customer service. A tech called back about an hour later. He said to reverse one of the pulleys. This would certainly solve the alignment problem. It didn't. I had to drill out the holes in the base to form slots. I could then slide the saw over far enough for better alignment. R&D might want to provide these slots. It might have prevented two hours of cutting up a brand new saw base."
3,SOME BUGS STILL NEED TO BE WORKED OUT,This saw has very sloppy lower blade guides and the base does not firmly support the frame of the band saw.I recomend calling customer service to see if they have corrected this problem before you buy this tool.
3,Delta 28-206,"A pretty good saw, but I've had several issues. With the height extension the upper and lower castings were no longer alligned. Delta sent me a whole new upper casting, but I found out through great pain that the two mating surfaces were not machined parallel - I had to shim them. The upper guide bracket which holds the bearing and guide blocks cracked, it's due to a round post in a hex shaped hole. The design is bad and needs to be fixed. I'm still waiting for parts (3 weeks now from Delta) for replacement. The blade guard is poor, I don't think much work was put into this design. Not what I consider typical ""old school"" Delta, but it's not! Off-shore all the way - I guess that's why it has a relatively good price. No shame to Amazon, they still provide great deals on Delta tools."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this Delta bandsaw 5 months ago, and have not cut a piece of wood yet! The machine vibrated so bad that I was scared to use it.I spent $$ on aftermarket parts to cut down on vibration. I hired a local machinist to make the stand more sturdy. I phoned Customer Service 5 times. They were friendly and sent me several new parts. The local Delta Serviceman has the saw now. After 6 weeks of work, he just called to tell me he cannot fix the vibration and has given up trying.I do not recommend this saw."
1,This book is garbage,"As is usual for India, this book is printed on toilet paper, has no color photos, and worst of all, has NOTHING to do with Tibetan art, which was my search criterion. It was NEVER DESIGNATED as printed in India, or I would have skipped it completely. It is thin, poorly written, and is NOT WORTH anyone's time. I recommend that this not be sold, and that Amazon's search engine be made to CONFORM to the client's search criteria."
2,"Anchor best for decoration, not anchoring a real boat.","We had to buy a different anchor. The problem wasn't the weight of the anchor, the problem is that the lips move only in a certain way and makes it almost impossible to anchor our boat. We wasted an entire fishing day trying to anchor ourselves with this anchor. Bought a different one that is more mobile and we were set in 30 seconds. If you're serious about trying to anchor your boat don't buy this! The shipper was great, the way this anchor was made is horrible."
2,beware of system screwup,"After receiving this item, I first I thought the seller had presented a misleading description. I was expecting a 10 pound anchor and the one that arrived weighed slightly less than 5. On closer inspection of the Amazon listing, I see that buried in the seller's description is a weight of 5 pounds, the problem was in how Amazon had it categorized it (when you pick 10 pound from the multiple choice size selection, this one comes up). If you want a 5 pound anchor this one may be ok; although the welds look really crappy, they'd probably hold. If you want a 10 pounder, keep looking."
4,"Good Anchor, appears to be well made.","Anchor appears to be well made, seems to be a good price point. I like the fact that that the Ring will slide back to the anchor head if the anchor gets stuck on the bottom when attempting to retrieving it."
3,Does the trick,"Does what it's supposed to do, but with the negative aspects inherent in any teleconverter."
3,tough to use,This lens doubles your existing lens but do you have the right lens and are you good at manual focus?It certainly doubles certain lenses but getting that list seems difficult to do. I bought this product and it works as advertised although I had to look at the other lens I bought to figure out if this lens worked with it!
1,not a fit,"for some reason, this did NOT work with my lenses, Don't know why as I really wanted it... I'll go through a camera specialist for a new one."
1,Not for Pentax not sigma lenses,"Buyer beware! these teleconverters only fit a very specific list of Pentax and sigma lenses. Caution, Caution, Caution Will Robinson!!!!!!!! I orderd the 2x and the 1.4x neither worked with my lenses. It fit the Pentax K mount but not the lenses (go figure). Go figure."
4,Affordable and quality,"I've used Canon lenses, Tamron and Sigma. All are fine products. For my money I have found that Sigma works well, without the high cost of Canon.Currently, I'm using my extender with a Mark III and mainly my f2.8 70-200mm Sigma lense. I'm mainly shooting High School Football games with this combo & my Turbo 2x2. It's working out beautifully! I would highly suggest the Sigma line of lense, esp if you're on a budget."
3,Sigma APO Teleconverter 2x EX DG for Canon Digital SLR Cameras,Not compatable with Cannon lens only select Sigma lens.
1,confused as hell.,"Why would you make a product that is suppose to fit between my camera an my lens, fit my camera but not my lens? Am I stupid?"
1,only works with very select lens',"i bought this item to extend my shooting range on my nikon d100 - the longest lens i have is a 300mm. the 2X converter didn't fit my nikkor 300mm, my tamron 28-80mm or my nikon 105."
2,Reduces image quality too much,"I bought this to use with a Sigma 150-500mm telephoto. Unless you go out in the middle of the day in bright sunlight and shoot at the long end of the lens, very few of the photos are crisp. If you have bright sun and can be about 50=75 feet away from the subject, those can turn out okay, but just okay. If you shoot a big lens with it in the morning or with overcast, the 2 stop reduction it adds just can't be overcome. It's a bummer because the 150-500mm is a great lens but when shooting wildlife, you can't get close enough and it'd be nice to have a ""big bertha"" alternative w/o having to get a second mortgage."
3,don't expect to much,"Does as advertised, just be aware of manual focus, and larger f/stop slower shutter speed in low lite (cloudy) takes time to focus so if you plan on photographing wild life you may miss a lot of shots but when you get it the results are great. very little cropping is nessery ."
2,Doesn't fit Sigma DC 18-200 Lens,"My wife ordered this from my wish list for me for Christmas. It fit my Sony A55 perfect, it would not fit the Sigma 18-200 lens that I have. I returned it for a refund and was charged a $37 surcharge. I'd be careful in your selection, it says it fits""select"" lens. I would have thought Sigma lens would fit Sigma lens."
1,Not for Sony or Minotal Lenses,"I do not blame Sigma (except for printing the worse instructions I've ever seen), I blame Amazon for not advertising the fact that Sigma Teleconverters are for use with Sigma lenses only. Though the Teleconverter attaches to the a100, neither Sony nor Milolta lenses will attach to it."
4,Good for those who want Streets on CD,I like this disc a lot. I just wish the powers that be would release the first two Streets recordings on CD. This recording showed that Streets were excellent live.
2,Steve Walsh...mmmm....goood....,"How could you ever get tired of Steve Walsh's voice? He is certainly one of the greatest vocalists of all time. Billy Greer on bass is not only a great bassist, but another excellent vocalist. Overall, this CD really rocks! If you are a Kansas fan (and who isn't?) add this to your collection. Not as classically steeped, but rocks out in an equally pleasing way."
2,"LOVE Mike Slamer, but don't bother here","Mike Slamer is one of the top-3 guitarists you've never heard. Luckily, I discovered him in time to purchase ""Nowhere Land"" which is a monster, and showcases every angle of this virtuoso player. I had followed him since hearing him play on Fiona's ""Squeeze"" a few years back, and decided to Google his roots all the way back to Atlanta and the band Streets. When I saw this King Biscuit release, I had to have it, but wow. What a let-down. Sounds like 80's schlock-rock, with no memorabe songs or explosive guitar theatrics. Just something you'd find in the bargain bin as 80's filler. Oh well, I won't hold that against you, Mike!! You're still a dynamo and there are songs on Nowhere Land I listen to every week, even 2 years after buying the CD. That's a master-work, while this is unfortunately more garage band than hidden gem of roots-rock."
4,We are one big family!,"This was a fascinating look on not only the great expansion of humankind but, most importantly, how closely linked we all are. I especially liked how they illustrated this at the end, with people positioned in the region of their ancestors, and then going back in time until eventually we all came from one of two groups."
3,"profound and fundamental, but presentation was watered down and too slow","Profound fundamental connections, but the presentation of the material seemed far too slow and watered down. Far too much repetition for me. More technology as to explaining the tracing of genetic drift could have been presented. Challenge the viewer a bit more! Graphics as to genetic diversity would have helped to underlay the commonality of human species. No details as to genetic differences of Neanderthal similarity or diversity was provided. This was an important dead end subspecies."
2,Not recommended,"After recently losing my twin boys @ 16weeks, I was looking for a book from someone who had been through the loss of an unborn child in a HEALTHY way. This author is NOT emotionally healthy. It has been four YEARS since she lost her baby, she states, and the nursery is still totally in tact, waiting for her baby...?? That's not where I hope to be in four years. I wish I hadn't have purchased the book. I'll keep looking for an author who can actually help-"
5,Life Touches Life,I lost my baby girl on 2/26/06 at 40 weeks unexpectedly. This book helped me to understand that I am not alone in my feelings and grief. I just want to feel what is normal but I don't know what that is - she had a way with putting it into perspective and supporting the feelings of loss that I am experiencing. This is a must read for mothers of stillborn babies - it was the most comforting out of the several books on infant loss that I read.
5,THIS BOOK IS A RARE GIFT THAT TOUCHES THE INNER SOUL,"THIS BOOK IS A GIFT!I HAVE WORKED WITH FAMILIES WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE LOSS OF A CHILD DURING PREGNANCY AND SHORTLY AFTER FOR 17 YEARS, WHILE READING THIS INSPIRING BOOK I CALLED 3 MOMS TO SUGGEST THAT THEY READ THE BOOK IMMEDIATELY, LORRAINE ASH HAS AN AMAZING ABILITY OF RELAYING HER STORY, EXPERIENCES AND FEELINGS,CAPTURING EXACTLY WHAT ALL MOMS ARE FEELING, SO MANY EMOTIONS, SO MANY MEMORIES,SO MANY FEELINGS...LORRAINE RELATES PERSONAL, INTIMATE DETAILS WITH SUCH INSIGHT AND WISDOM AND ULTIMATELY LETS US KNOW THAT WE ARE IN CHARGE OF HOW WE FEEL, AND OF HOW PEOPLE REACT TO OUR LOSSES AND OUR FEELINGS.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY READER,IT IS A TRIBUTE TO THE HUMAN SPIRITI WISH I COULD PURCHASE HUNDREDS OF THIS BOOK TO GIVE AS GIFTS TO THE FAMILIES I KNOW WHO HAVE HAD A CHILD DIE."
2,Buyer be warned,If I could give this disc two different ratings I would. One for performance and another for production/sound quality. While the performance is top-notch this disc is marred by slip-shod sound. There is an annoying perisitant buzz throughout this disc. It's especially irritating during quiet passages. There are also occasional bursts of feedback. Asking to pay full price for this disc is a thievery. If I could demand my money back I would.
5,Best of the Best,"This recording has received bad reviews in regard to sound quality, but I have no problem overlooking a few minor technical gliches, because the performance is nothing less than phenomenal.This is a very mature Renaissance at their peak and a true fan would do well to give it a listen. The musicians are inspired and the group's cohesion as well as individual musicianship has never come across better. Annie's duo with Tout's keyboards in 'Can You Understand' is clear as a bell, unlike its more subdued version at Carniegie, and Camp's bass is much more effectual. This performance of the 'Song of Scheherazade' is the best on record.Renaissance is always a good listen, but this recording will make you feel the music. To pass on it because of sound quality issues is simply a mistake, especially for a true Renaissance fan."
5,Awesome Brewing Machine,"This Brewstation is awesome. No worry about the Carafe and it makes really good coffee. I had purchased mine in a store and everyone , that experiences this machine and the coffee, want one. The one I purchased here was a Christmas present well received."
4,Really good coffee,"This BrewStation makes a really good cup of coffee. After reading the blase reviews and complaints of poor tasting brew, I had second thoughts about ordering it from Amazon. But decided to order it anyway.Then I read the instructions that came with the BrewStation and thoroughly cleaned it prior to use(as recommeded in the instructions) and the coffee tastes great.I'd give it 5 stars but it dribbles a little condensate from the back of the lid when opening to clean."
5,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!!","This coffee pot supersedes all other coffee pots. Hands down. After buying it for myself and loving it, I bought it for my parents and my mother-in-law. They all think it's fabulous. The coffee tastes great, it fits under my cupboard, and it's super easy to clean. A couple of slight problems that I've experienced are the auto shut-off and tall travel cups. Really the tall travel cups are not a problem, you either move it toward the front of the counter or slightly tilt the cup. No problem! As for the shut-off mechanism, I'm not sure. 99% of the time, it shuts off after two hours. On a few occasions though, this did not happen. I thought it could have been caused by a power outage resetting the clock, but the time was not affected. Who knows? It's only happened twice, but I keep a close watch on it now. Even without the auto shut-off, the pot is worth it. Friends and family beg me to make coffee when they visit just so they can use it. Go get one today!"
3,"Love/Hate relationship,","I also, tried everything to clean this. I found a small amount Dishwasher detergent (Cascade) cleans it wonderfully.I would have given 4 1/2 stars, instead of five, because the unreadable clock is annoying, but this morning, we found no coffee made even though it automatically turned on. Water stayed in the reservoir and did not brew."
2,Gave-up after 2,"I loved the idea, but my experience was such that I went back to a traditional coffeemaker. The problems were: if you break the bucket that the coffee brews into you have to buy a new unit, no replacement carafes. It would seem like it would be hard to break, but the dishwashing member of my family broke two when they fell off the dishrack onto the floor. The second problem is the plastic bucket (carafe) is hard to clean and will quickly stain. This is not only unappealing visually, it begins to effect the taste of the coffee as it gets that I've-been-hanging-out-in-old-plastic-taste."
2,Why bother?,"I received my first one for Christmas and in less then 6 months the handle broke on the part that you fill with water. I called and they sent me another one. In the mean time, the button that you push to dispense the coffee into your cup broke. We purchased another, brand new coffee pot. Now less then three months later the handle broke, the on/off button is not working right and it will only make 6 cups no matter how many times I clean it. I would rather purchase a cheaper priced coffee maker that will last."
1,NO .. KEEP LOOKING,"We have been having bad luck with coffee makers and this one is worse so far. Ended up spending just under $100 for it (with filter, shipping etc.) Had to return first one that seemed to have a mind of it's own (clock issue I believe). Rather than asking for refund (which I should have insisted on) I returned for new one which, although not AS defective, is still a pain. Where are the coffee makers that lasted years and we only had to replace because we wanted a ""new"" look????? If anyone out there has a recommendation PLEASE let me know."
2,"Poor Quality, Confusing Operation","This seems like it is made of very poor quality. It feels as though it is going to fall apart soon.It is confusing to use as there are no water lines instead just numbers. And there are two sets of numbers at different heights. So if you want water for 6 cups, do you fill up to the back number 6 or front number 6. Then do you fill to the bottom of the number, top of the number, or middle of the number?They recommend a permanent coffee filter. I got one and it doesn't fit. The lid doesn't close when using the permanent filter.The on/off button has to be pressed twice to turn it on. The first press turns on the automatic brewing. It is very easy to press it too many times. Several times when turning it off, I accidentally pressed it twice. I didn't realize this until the next morning when a little bit of coffee that was left is now burnt."
2,brewstation,"slow to make coffee, also coffee is just warm, not what you want if your looking for a good HOT cup!"
4,Tastes Great,"I just purchased this coffee maker and I love it ! The ""ONLY"" down side is that you are unable to read the clock. You cannot see it unless you are at eye level and then it does not illuminate.For the price that I paid I am disapointed in that feature; why have a clock if you can't view it?Otherwise it makes a great cup of coffee !"
3,Electronics Not Working,Received coffee maker in June. Makes good coffee; rather large item to place under cabinet; unable to read clock and timer - it needs to be well lit; the clock and timer do not work - item will not stay on; returning item and getting a replacement. Hope the next one works ok! Makes it real nice for my mom who is unable to lift other coffee makers. I'll let all of you know how the next one works.
1,Change of heart...,"I reviewed this coffee maker after I purchased it about 6 months ago. I loved it in the beginning...it's a great concept and made a great cup of coffee (no burnt tasting coffee after it had been on for a while). BUT, the other night I went to make a pot and the thing simply didn't work. The light came on and the it started getting hot, but no coffee. What a disappointment. Again, I think it's a great concept, but this coffeemaker missed the mark."
1,Don't waste your time,"The FIRST time I used the BrewStation I could not get the coffee to stop coming out. When I finally got it stopped I had 4 cups of coffee on my counter. But that isn't the worst of it......coffee grounds in my coffee!!!! NO THANKS, it's going back."
1,Brews coffee with a taste of rubber or plastic,"I ordered this item through Amazon. When it arrived I followed the instructions for cleaning the unit with the cleaning packet that was included. After running two cycles with clean water I brewed a pot of coffee and it tasted very bad, like rubber or plastic. I thought that this was due to the unit being new. After four or five brew cycles the poor taste persisted and I returned the item for a refund. Additionally, the dispensing spigot leaked a few drops after filling each cup of coffee. I was very disappointed with the product. The brew station is a good idea but it fails to deliver a good cup of coffee."
1,it doesn't keep coffee hot - nothing else matters,"if you want hot coffee, you want hot coffee. it's a nice toy; it may save you sometime by not having a glass carafe to break; and it is a novel variant on the standard boring coffee maker.But it DOESN'T MAKE HOT COFFEE. It makes warm coffee; lukewarm coffee; tepid coffee."
1,not worth the money,"So cheaply made I sent it back. Also, the water filter would be a pain. Don't know where you could buy it. And if Hamilton Beach sells them it would be expensive what with shipping. I live on an island in Alaska. Every thing comes 2nd day air. But mainly it was just that it was so cheaply made."
2,Many Design Flaws,"This coffee maker is a big disappointment for the following reasons:- Coffee Filter Insert Sits on top of Hot coffee. Very Hot when you go to empty.- The process of making coffee is cumbersome , feels like your mixing cement.- The unit get dirty and stained to easily- Hard to tell if the unit is on brew vs timed brew- Clock is too small.- Hot Coffee sits in plastic, yuk yuk yuk._ When Emptying coffee out of the unit it is very possible to burn your hands, if you are dumping out hot coffee the steam burns your hands when holding onto the handle, And if you are not careful you can burn your hands on the bottom heating plate when tipping the old coffee out."
1,chicago cup,"I am not a picky coffee drink by any means but I have never tasted such blah coffee ever, and believe me I tried to spice it up with cinnamon and it still had no taste.I tried every type of coffee from Kona to grocery store coffee.Perhaps I am missing something but it takes like plastic even the very first cup I ever made so cleaning it with vinegar after the first try seems silly.I have only made coffee from it a few of times because it is so tasteless and I keep hoping that maybe it was just the type of coffee.I have filtered water so I know that can't be the problem either.If there is anyway to make this better please let me know."
1,The worst coffee maker I have ever owned,"This product was awful from the time we bought it. We purchased it because we hadn't seen one like it before and thought it would be nice to not have a caraffe. We were wrong. After the third time Hamilton Beach replaced it for malfunctions, we decided that was enough and went out and bought a traditional coffee maker. It made bad coffee, was hard to clean, and was messy. I would not recommend this product."
3,Like It But Problems,I have had one of these brewmaster for about a year. I am getting ready to order another one because I do like it so much BUT the one I have has started leaking coffee all over the counter when it cools off. I am hopeful that it is just a flaw in the one I have and that the next one will be better.
3,Makes Good Coffee but...,"It makes a good cup of coffee and keeps it's original flavor after being on for several hours. However, The handle broke on the plastic coffee container within a few days of use, but we could still make coffee and you can't see the handle so it was no big deal. But, what a mess it makes on the counter! We have to keep a paper towel under it to catch the drips. Their push button coffee is a great concept that needs to be sent back to the drawing board for tweaking. Because of the price, I only knocked off two stars."
3,Bad experience,"I was so excited to use the Brewstation That I received for Christmas. It worked fine..for 2 weeks. Then one night, I put the cup against the lever,and coffee stated pouring out, and didn't stop. There was some kind of malfuntion in the ""bucket"" (I call it). I don't know if it was a seal or what, but I returned it to the store.I really didn't want to take a chance on another one because what if that had happened early in the morning when the timer came on,and no one was around?"
1,BrewStation,"This product is a major disappointment. Six months ago I ordered the BrewStation for myself and liked it so much I ordered another as a gift. Had I known then what I know now I certainly would not have done that. The handle on the bucket broke this weekend. Thankfully, it was not full of hot coffee at the time. Within two days of that happening, the auto shut-off quit working. These defects could be extremely dangerous. If you assume the auto shut-off works, please don't. We have all heard of homes burning down because appliances were left on. Don't use the handle to lift the bucket.I think Hamilton Beach should recall these and rework the design. The general concept is great but, as they stand, the coffee makers are dangerous."
2,Works Great at First but Break Within a Month,"At first when I saw it on the advertisement, I was so excited that I decided to get it for my husband's birthday. When I first gotten it, it was perfect and was really easy to use even though it was taller than I thought which makes it a little difficutl to put it under the cabinet. It was working fine until the second week when it started to act up for me. Finally, it decided to call it quit. There is no way I can get the clock to work and power on. Amazon has been great in helping me to solve this poblem of returning the product. There is definately a product flaw somewhere in the maker which the manufacture has failed to test it before lauching it out to the market. As you can see from the review, a lot of people seem to be having trouble using this product. Please remember to measure the dimension between the countertop and the cabinet prior to buying this product."
1,Clock/Timer Went Crazy,Worked fine for the first couple of months but then the clock/timer started to act up. Was affraid of a fire hazard so we returned it to the store.
1,"Great concept, poor safety","I bought the Hamilton Beach 47224 Brewmaster because I believe the concept of ""no carafe, one cup serving"" is great. I returned the first one the next day because it would turn on, but not brew (pump wouldn't work). I returned the second one 2 days later after brewing several ""pots"", 4/6/10 cups. In all cases the coffee reservoir leaked from the dispensing hole. Also, the brewed coffee somehow managed to drip down the side and accumulate around the heating element. Somehow brewed coffee even got inside the unit. Condensate water for the lid also dripped inside the unit. I consider this an electrical safety hazard and returned the unit and got a refund. Too bad, the concept is good."
1,No Good,"The idea behind the maker is a good one. But, not thought out very well. Within one week the plastic insert that holds the coffee was stained. The 2 hour shut off is really the pits most other makers are 4 hours. The coffee starts getting cold a half an hour before it shuts off. The big selling point of this maker was that your coffee can sit in it all day without tasting burnt. Well, of course it doesn't taste burnt it doesn't stay on long enough."
1,Piece of Junk,"After buying this coffee pot, I experienced the exact same problems with the clock and programming it to brew at a specific time. The unit also holds a lot of excess water in the lid after brewing, once you lift the lid to clean it out, the water goes all over your counter, it also seems that the unit leaks water because there was always water all over my counter after it finished brewing. On a positive note, the machine was taken back and I am now back to my plain old coffee pot."
2,"Great idea, bad implementation","This pot is a great idea. Too bad they didn't make it better. Mine stopped working after one month. I'm guessing the heater element burned out, so back to the store with it.Also the on/off switch is confusing and annoying. Press it once, nothing happens. Press it a second time, it turns on. Press it a 3rd time, it goes off. And there is no automatic 2 hour shut off, unlike any self respecting coffee maker, so if you leave it on for a day or two, you have some very strong coffee."
1,Not That Great At All,"I'm not that impressed with this coffee maker at all. I initially bought it because of the promise of keeping the coffee hot. What I experienced with the first one I bought was that it leaked - at the bottom of the water holder, there is a plastic plug that fell out and went down the drain - then it wouldn't hold water. I purchased another one and the plastic plug fell out again, fortunately, grabbed it before it went down the drain. The handle on the basket broke and the timer/clock function stopped working the first week. After several months, I have to press the button several times to get it to complete one cycle of making a full pot. As time went on, sometimes I would get a hot cup of coffee, sometimes, I wouldn't and I'm finding it's taking longer and longer to brew. It's going in the garbage and I'm going back to my Mr. Coffee Maker."
2,Broke not long after the warranty expired.,"It was a Christmas gift for my wife and it worked fine. That is until the warranty expired; the valve to dispense the coffee broke. It was cheap plastic and over time it gave in to the stress of daily use. My exparience with Hamilton-Beach over the past 10-15 years has been anything but spectacular. I try to stay away from their products as often as possible. This just seems to validate my reasons.Don't bother with the extra filters, you'll never get the chance to use them."
3,"Works great, when it works","Bought this machine in December 2003, loved it from day one. Water reserve does get stained by the coffee and does not come clean, but the coffee and convenience are great. However, in June, only 6 months later, the machine quit working. Would not brew at all. Hamilton beach told us to cut the plug off the cord and send it to them. We did and they sent us a brand new coffee maker. So far so good. Ask me again in 6 months."
1,"If you like coffee, don't buy this machine.",I've ran cleaner through the machine three times. I've soaked it in hot soapy water twice. I've sacrificed ten pots of coffee to this machine. All to no avail. The coffee still comes out tasting like plastic and chemicals.
3,Coffee Level Indicator Stains,"This coffee maker is actually great, especially for an small office setting. I have one disappointment with this coffee maker: The clear shield that shows the level of coffee in the pot, is made of plastic and after only a short while, it has stained so badly that you can no longer tell how much coffee is in the pot. Other than that, I think that this coffee maker is a great idea. On Hamilton Beach's next version, they should make the plastic pot stain-free."
1,4 dead in under 5 months,"We loved the concept of this coffee maker we bought one for ourselves and one for our mother. Both died, same symptoms as all the others first the clock would stop working then it would not stay warm, and finaly would not brew. We recieved replcements about 1 1/2 months ago for both, and already both have stoped brewing.This product needs to be recalled it, is extremly poorly designed from the inside. The circuit board is not shielded form the moisture that builds up in the lower 1/2 of the coffee maker."
1,sorry product,i recieved my hamilton beach brew station as a christmas gift. it is only five months old and it doesn't keep my coffee hot anymore.i honestly rate it a zero but your rating wouldn't let me put zero. the sad part is that my warranty cards got misplaced in all wrapping paper and tossed out.i am very annoyed that i must purchase a new coffee maker.
3,What you get depends on where you buy it,"I bought one to replace the old Mr. Coffee and separate coffee grinders and thermal carafe - basically to save counterspace. Mine worked as advertised but got tired of timer turning off after 2 hrs - then coffee got very cold, very fast. Also, bought mine at Walmart for $38 - but their box neglected to mention the water filter is not included (available by mail from factory for $9 ,as is a permanent filter). The coffee is adequate but difficult to judge how much coffee and how much water to ad. Going back to my old set up - coffee better, easier to make and stays hot all day in the thermos carafe."
3,Pros & Cons,"There are a number of pros & cons to owning this paticular coffee maker.Pros1. Easy to clean2. Has an optional water filter which can filter out any junk in your water3. Easy one touch operationCons1. Programed to shut off after 2 hours2. Takes a lot of coffee grounds to make a strong cup3. Clock on the machine is to small and in the wrong placeOverall, I would not own this coffee maker if I had not gotten it for free."
4,So far so good !,"I just made my frist pot or should I say non pot of coffee. I found it easy to use and the coffee tasted very good. Some of the other reveiws do concern me on how long this product will last . One disappointment is ,that you would think they would supply you with at least one coffee filter , untill you go to store and purchase replacements ! The top ,that flips open does seem flimsy , and I hope it will pass the test of time ? As the title of my reveiw states ,so far so good . I love the no pot idea !"
4,Not too pleased with the Brewstation!,Liked the ease of getting a cup of coffee from the front one at a time but keeping the view window clean was almost a daily job. If they used real glass instead of the porous plastic we could have kept it clean enough to tell if there was coffee in it or not. Made great coffee and the cleaning every other time we used it kept us from giving it a 5 star review.
4,WOOOHOOOO,"I like this coffee maker, especially after I figured out that I have to buy the restaurant style larger filters. The standard ones will not suffice as the grounds will get into the coffee, lodge into the server part and you will get a continuing leak. THAT WAS AN EPISODE OR 2 OF AMERICAS FUNNIEST HOME/SCHOOL VIDEOS! I have never had the problem once I bought the right filter. Remember, GET THE LARGE 12 CUP FILTERS. In my town Kroger is the only store that sells them.Called Restaurant Style.I use a 1/8 cup coffee scoup and use 5 heaping scoupfulls for a 12 cup pot and the coffee is perfect. I fill the water level right below the slots right inside the lid.I keep it at school and make coffee for the teachers. THEY LOVE MY COFFEE! The dispenser is great because as teachers always do, kids come and get coffee for them and this eliminates the kids pouring coffee."
5,Very nice,"This machine consistently gives you fast, hot, and great tasting coffee. It does everything asked of it with no trouble. I don't know what some reviewers are complaining about when they say it doesn't stay hot enough. Mine keeps the coffee piping hot for over three hours. Highly recommended and a good price."
4,"Machine is great, replacement of water filter pods outrageous","This machine is great, works well, great for travel mugs, (just pull the coffee machine to the edge of the counter!), keeping coffee warm during a nice long lazy Sunday morning, etc.HOWEVER!!! Be warned, because the water filter pod can only be purchased with another handle for $10 for 2!!! plus shipping and handling... or if you order 3 at a time you get free shipping, but then you end up with 4 of the pod handle/holder things and 6 pods... ridiculous. Why not sell a bundle of just the pods, in a pack of 10 or so!!!???"
3,"Great potential, but....","Great concept, and it works well, but because it uses plastic instead of glass to hold the coffee once brewed, it will require a very good cleaning specifically after use with flavored coffee.The smell and taste tend to remain in the plastic. Another issue is that if you have a large cup, you must move the machine to the very front of the counter."
4,Well done Hamilton Beach,"Yes it's a bit quirky when it comes to water measurement but as with most coffee makers you get used to it (its not rocket science). The unit is very well made from quality plastics. I get up a good hour or two before my wife and she hated the coffee I would leave in the pot (with our old coffee maker). So I would wash our old maker out and refill it with fresh coffee for her, but not any more. This product keeps it at a good temperature and is fairly airtight, and the coffee stays good tasting for the two hours its in the machine. Our water is all ready filtered so that is not an issue for us and we dont plan on buying their filter at additional cost. I have two compaints, the unit is pretty big in both width and height. The other is that the clock is hard to read, unless you're three feet high and can look directly into it."
4,excellent machine,"replaced my worn out krups with this machine.- well built- very easy to clean, and load w/coffee to brew- it keeps the coffee hot, even when I make just 2 cups,and doesn't get too much of that burned taste when lefton a while. (not perfect, but very good)I'd say the krups makes a better tasting cup, butthis machine is very close. Not having a carafe isa major bonus, no cleaning or burnt coffee.The timer works just fine..."
1,"Too tall, too short","I saw this item on TV and loved the concept of no carafe. That is cool BUT - the unit is too tall to fit under my kitchen cabinet - be sure to check the dimensions. Also, the dispensing area is too short to accomodate a travel mug or even a tallish mug. Coffee was weaker than I was used to with my standard amount of grounds but of course that was solved with more grounds. Not my favorite coffeemaker."
2,"tried it, didn't like it","I had one of these and like the idea of keeping the coffee warm without using a pot. However, I couldn't get it to make coffee that tasted good and ultimately I decided the convenience wasn't worth poor tasting coffee."
1,Worst product I have ever bought,"I have had this piece of @#*! for 3 years and have had nothing but problems with it. And if you think Hamilton Beach has anything like customer service, you had better think again. The tank handle broke the first time and they did send me a tank with a re-designed handle ""as a favor"". Now the warmer on the bottom of the tank is coming up. Do yourself a favoe and stay as far away from this thing as you can."
1,it is a great idea but no longevity,i bought one of these in july before they came out.it lasted three months. the second one died the day before thanksgiving. i am through with this product and just hope the company will give me my money back.
4,Works best for me....,"After buying 2 Bodum Vacuum Coffeemakers (the carafes had cracked on both), I decided to live the hassle-free life and got this little puppy! I LOVE IT. I am pleased with it. Since I don't drink coffee everyday (and sometimes find the MOLDY COFFEE GRINDS LEFTOVER FROM A WEEK LATER -- you know what I am talking about!), I just use it as a hot water dispenser. Since I've been back from London, I've been drinking alot of Nescafe Instant Coffee and Earl Grey tea, so this is great when I'm switchy and I don't have to worry about ""left-over"" coffee taste in my tea. I think it's great if you have alot of different uses for hot water such as hot cocoa so each family member can have their favorite drink in the winter time!Water comes out quickly but I gave it 4 stars because I think the hot water could be hotter... but maybe I'm just picky..."
2,coffee maker,This coffee maker makes great coffee but had to send it back the clock goes blank at times
2,BrewStation Drawbacks,"I loved this machine when first purchased in 2003. However, I am now not so enthused. First, it is to large and cumbersome on the countertop; the coffee tank is seriously stained and I have tried to clean it but impossible (which also makes the unit an eyesore); and we also throw out excess coffee since it gets cold fast due to the automatic shutoff. Automatic shutoff is a convenient safety feature however it shuts off too soon hence cold coffee. I have no negative comment on the brewed coffee taste. The convenience of not needing a glass coffee pot works for my husband and I, but when serving several guests we need to transfer coffee to a coffee server. Also there is a water filter in the machine which should have been replaced several months ago, however having to call in to order a new filter is inconvenient. I would not purchase this unit again."
1,Gotta return it after only 1 use!,"I was so excited when I found this coffee maker, thinking I wouldn't have to worry about the base getting all burnt and gross looking....and that the coffee would dispense by the cup when I wanted it...well.....I went to program the maker as the instructions stated...and to my surprise, when I went to get my coffee this morning....no coffee! I noticed that the clock on the machine was flashing...and I knew that I had set it properly last night. Apparently, after a call to Hamilton Beach Customer Service, this machine cannot be plugged into the same outlet as any other appliance without some sort of part (factory installed)that ours obviously wasn't equipped with...therefore, everytime I switched on an under-the-counter light...the clock on the coffee-maker would reset to 12:00am....so...it's back to Target with this machine and no more Hamilton Beach!"
4,Good Coffee Maker,This has been a good coffee maker. We have had it for over a year. that is a record for us. It makes coffe and keeps it warm. That is really all I ask.PROS: Brew start to first cup available is lightning quick. Easy to clean. Can be washed in dishwasher. Easy.CONS: Has hot plate heater so it continues to cook coffee instead of insulated carafe or similar. Causes taste to worsen over time. Water filters are expensive. Translucent front quickly gains uncleanable coffee stain.
4,Convenient But Messy !!!,"This Brewstation replaced a Farberware Espresso,coffee machine. I was looking for something that would be state of the art as well as good looking on my countertop. The concept of the single cup dispenser was the deciding factor for me but has become a down fall. There is a washer/seal in the dispenser that drips and drips. If you leave any coffee in the machine you will wake to a mess all over the counter. I have learned to empty the pot every time I am done with it to avoid this but feel that it is a design flaw that should have to been addressed by the manufacturer. I don't like the fact that I have to keep purchasing the filters or I end up with a bitter cup of coffee. Also, Very tall on the counter but not tall in the dispenser so taller mugs won't fit under it without making a mess."
4,Very Pleased,We had a BrewStation in the past and it finally quit working. We enjoyed it so much we decided to buy another one. All of the department stores (including Wal-Mart) had gone up on their prices greatly. We were able to get a better deal at Amazon. We enjoy or coffee maker and intend to shop at Amazon again.
5,Great gift,"I bought this as a gift for a family member who uses this everyday, he says. it's been working like new since I purchased it, right out of the gate, it's awesome. I would recommend this to anyone, gift or personal use!"
1,Hamilton Beach 47224 12 cup Brewstation,"We had this Hamilton Beach Brewstation for less than six months when it started leaking, at first just a little, then ran coffee all over the counter and down the front of the cabinet. We tossed it out."
5,Great Coffee maker,"We have had this coffee maker for quite a few years now and really love it. I like the convenience of just pushing the cup to the button and the coffee dispenses. It can be a little hard to clean the water well, but that is only a once in a while chore. No decanter to worry about breaking makes it very nice for us to take in our RV. My kids have bought this model and swear by it, too."
2,not that good,"i mainly bought this for the rare fifteen and downfall (ex-op ivy!!) songs, as well as the blatz, krupted peasant farmerz, wynona riders, and pinhead gunpowder songs. and other than those, not that much else here is worth listening to twice. the 'very small world' 2xlp comp ('can of pork's rival, more on that later) is better, if you can find a copy. also, the downfall song is pretty weak, if you want an amazing song by them find a copy of the 'four two pudding' cd comp on very small...very small is/was? david hayes' (ex-lookout! records staff member) label and their 'very small world' compilation was released the same time as this, causing lots of competetion, and in my opinion is the better of the two."
5,Best I've Seen on Designing a Database,"Access has changed the way the world looks at database programs. Sure SQL was invented by IBM and Oracle, and their products are first rate. But go try to use them to keep track of your collection of whatevers. The graphical front end on Access makes it practical for you to develop a database in a relatively few minutes.With its popularity have come a lot of books on how to use Access. I have a problem with most of them because they leave out what I consider to be the most important part, the initial design of a database that will contain what you need in an easy to understand, easy to work with, and easy to modify when you need to add features later on. The couple of chapters on normalization are worth the cost of the book. This is as clear and simple an explanation as I've ever seen. Basically the book says: ""Think about these things before you start punching keys."""
4,"Good, but not great","Creating well thought-out tables and relationships is fundamental to good database design, and George Hepworth provides a valuable service by taking readers through this process.Unfortunately, I found myself tsk-tsking some of his advice. Why in the world, for example, would you allow for multiple addresses for your contact list, but attach the country to the contact rather than individual addresses? Does he have a rule that all of his friends and relatives with multiple households have to stay within a single country?Less important but still bothersome: How did he develop his intense and, IMHO, strange views on appropriate typefaces?I've referred several people to the book, but I always caution them, especially Access newcomers, to take the advice with a grain of salt."
3,Grover Park George on Access,I find this book interesting in the beginning but halfway through the book I got stuck as the author assumes that I can remember everything from the exercises. It could have been nice to have the steps reviewed as I find it difficult to go back and reference the required steps. I did not understand much of the VBA commands as I simply followed the example without understanding fully its use. I stopped using the book 5/8ths of the book as it became complicated for me.
2,detailed travel guide. little on hotels/restaurants,"Very compact guide on what to see and how to get there. The hotel listing is a bit brief - not much more than a list and it shows only 10 restaurants for the whole island. Good historical review and handy maps. Very helpful for the travelling tourist., not so focussed for a business travller who wants to be in and out in a few days."
2,Don't waste your money.,"This manual is absolute junk. Chilton has tried to cover far too much material for one book. They are trying to cover 4 different vehicles with 3 different (8 different layouts) engines in here. There are very few pictures, and few pictures available are often of a different motor/ layout than what you are actually trying to work on. The hand drawn diagrams lack sufficient detail to make actual location of parts practical. Some of the information is flat out wrong. I.E. location of the engine coolant drain on the 3rz-fe motor is on the opposite side from where indicated in this manual. The index is a joke and makes locating any specific information difficult and time consuming. Useful information like service interval for the fuel filter seem to be missing. There is some useful information here, other wise I would give it one star."
3,Not specific to my 1999 4-runner,This manual is helfull for very generic and general repairs/maintainace but was not nearly specific enough for my 1999 4-runner to give me accurate instructions/diagrams. It was helpful but I would prefer something that describes my exact make/model better.
5,Great Georeflectors,My students enjoyed using the georeflectors in class. They were able to grasp the concepts better with the hands-on experience. My principal came in and observed and found that the students were enjoying the georeflectors and wanted to try to use them. She had a great time using them since she had never seen them before.
4,Thorough but product-focused,"This book is exceptionally thorough; detailed and practical, with tons of worksheets and exercises to perform. However, it seems very focused on product-based business, versus service businesses. The author does include service businesses in his examples, but the exercises and worksheets seem to me to be very helpful for those people providing an actual product, with suppliers and vendors and product margins and the like. Overall a recommended book, especially if you're looking for an exceptionally detailed blueprint for moving from idea to execution."
5,"Great advice, easy to read, very motivating!!","I just started my business several months ago and it has been a roller coaster ride! There have been some really discouraging days and this book helps me find new ideas and inspiration to keep on going. Romanus provides great advice and motivation to follow your dreams, I feel like I have a personal small business consultant beside me as I read this book!"
4,An Enthusiast Is Backing You,"If you're enthusiastic about an occupation that would make the ideal job for you, follow the steps outlined by Romanus Wolter. They can be immediately applied. This is a concrete book full of varied examples, reminders, and life experience testimonies beside giving you a plan.From inspiration to copyright to marketing tools and financial statements, this book is behind, in front and beside you all the way, with warmth and encouragement.Give it a try!"
4,Fun and awesome music,"Other than The Matrix, I had never heard any other Don Davis score when purchasing the score to Ballistic. I was hesitant after I read this previous review and knowing the movie was awful, but rest assured the score is an awesome addition to any soundtrack collection. It's almost non-stop techno action music, with a couple of quiet songs in there to give your head a rest. This cd is for the fans of Trevor Rabin or the James Bond scores (I highly recommend this to any fan of Trevor Rabin's The One score). It is not 5 stars simply because a lot of the songs are similar, not that that's a bad thing though."
4,Nice earrings,"I wasn't expecting jewelry store quality from these. They look nice, but I am afraid to wear them too often, because the prongs look much less sturdy than they do in the pictures. Still a good deal, though."
5,Marvelous recipes and elegant photos,"Features 18 tea party themes with menus and recipes, ""A May Day Picnic"", ""Afternoon Wedding Reception"", ""High Tea Before the Theater"", ""Tea Dansant Buffet"", & ""Holliday Dessert Tea"" are some of them. The huge photos are of splendid tea table settings and colorfully garnished tea treats."
5,jml,Great music. Trevor Rabin sticks perfectly to the movie scenes and does not fall into the usual trap of the spin-off from previous action films. It's obvious that the soundtrack helped a lot the movie editing and its pace. Very good work.
3,A memorable theme...but the score is lacking....,"First off, I just want to say I love Trevor Rabin's work. He has done a great job within the past few years and introduced some great themes. Especially this one. National Treasure's theme is starting to be a very recognized theme.Unfortunately, I find the rest of the album...lacking something. I'm not sure what it's missing..maybe originality. A lot of it was rather repetitive..a bit like today's dance remixes. The same beat, rythm and even tune over and over again. Okay maybe not that bad...but I find myself deciding to not listen to it more than making the decision to listen to it.It certainly is a must-have for Rabin admirers but ultimately...it could be better."
5,The GREATEST soundtrack of all time!,"This motion picture soundtrack is the best! That`s my opinion anyway; the movie (National Treasure - Starring: Nicolas Cage) has been one of my top favorites ever since it came out. I also recommend the ""Titanic"" soundtrack as well if you are interested in this one. And if you have doubts as to whether or not to buy this CD, try listening to the clips. My personal favorite is: ""National Treasure Suite"" (Track 1). The Tracks: ""Library of Congress"" (Track 4), and ""Declaration of Independence"" (Track 2) are nice slower ones. Track: ""Spectacle Discovery"" (Track 10) is another one of my favorites also. Some of the tracks on this CD can be a little repetitive, but all in all, I think this CD is worth the money."
4,great ost!,"Trevor Rabin did it again. he had to be one of the best composers in recent times.i love Ben and Tresure best! its soothing and very soulful, esp Treasure. well done!"
5,Omg. Wow. Amazing,"Ok, First of all I have to say. My favourite Score of all time is easily ""The Day After Tomorrow"" mainly because of The Song ""presidents Speech"" that song was up-most Amazing. butttttt, then came along ""National Treasure"" with the song ""declaration Of Independance"" and that blew me away. I don't know how trevor Rabin does but but he is on the best out there today. he makes beautiful music and it always works. National treasure is no doubt a success. I insist you all to pick it up you wont regret it. The whole cd takes you away with every song, it is soothing to listen and it is just a blast. I havent seen the movie but listning to the score makes me want to watch it now and i can't wait."
5,Excellent Soundtrack!!,"This soundtrack is not only the best possible companion to the excellent movie it accompanies, but it is also magnificent music by itself and one of the greatest action/adventure movie scores ever composed. Mr. Rabin's many variations to three or four central themes make this CD a pleasure to listen to, even if it is only about 40 minutes long. All the tracks are superb, with ""Ben"", ""The Chase"", and ""Treasure"" among the finest. The entire CD is superbly done, and it is well worth your $15."
1,I doesn't work,I brought this product after seeing all the reviews on You-Tube & amazon. The very front of My hairline was thinning out some. So i used this product for a month & saw no results at all. Yes! I agree the smell is wonderful but it won't make ur hair grow in. Also I read 1 persons review that said it's great for ur cuticles & heels of ur feet. That also is un-true. When I used it on my heels & cuticles there was no change to them at all & I also did that for 1 month. I've finished all of my product & I will not be buying this again. I took The Mega-tek challange & it failed me.
3,Used on dog,Was hoping this product would help my dogs hair grow back. No success! But i loved the shampoo other wise. It smells fantastic!
3,Just eh,I thought this product would work pretty well and it hasn't. My bare areas are still bare. I will use this product until it is gone and I will not purchase it again.
3,Just got it,"I just got this product. It smells divine, feels light, has moisturized my hair already. I didn't like the fact that the cap wasn't sealed though; could be anything in there.I will come back in 2 weeks to post an update on progress... if any.Oh and shipping was ultra fast. Which is good."
3,Smoooth and Shiny!,"I can't say this has made my hair exactly ""grow faster""... but it has made it healthier and extremely soft and supple! However, I can't say I will be buying it again since its WAY too expensive for 2oz of product. If my hair miraculously got longer and Cinderella-ish ... then yeah- worth the price. But unfortunately it did not."
3,ummm,"This is one of those products I researched and began using because I just knew I found a miracle. Sike, I put this stuff on my scalp, maybe daily and my hair grew the way it has always grown. No miracles here, let the horses keep their products."
3,Trying Again,"Have used this product before, can't say i saw growth like other reviewers. mixed it with an oil moisturizer and applied directly to my scalp. Placed order on the 11th and it came in on the 14th. Product intact, no leakage. Just took out braids and had really damaged edges and tangles. Mixing with jamaican black castor oil. will keep you posted on the progress."
5,Mega-Tek really works!!,"Excellent for growing in bald spots thick and fast, yes I use it on my hair I use just about all of EQyss products on my hair. In addition, this stuff worked miracles on my cracked cuticles literally over night!"
4,So far so good!,"I've been using this product for two weeks now. I can honestly already see some results. I have excessive thinning/balding in the crown of my head due to stress and chemicals. I can tell that hair is filling in, this if very promising. I use this product every other evening and just massage it into the scalp in the balding areas followed by a rich hair moisturizing lotion. Then, once a week I use the 16oz rebuilder as a deep conditioner along with a super hydrating deep conditioner and apply heat for 25-30 minutes. This seems to be working for me. The MegaTek is very high in protein, so be sure to keep your hair well moisturized. Also, I notice some bad headaches when I use this, may just be due to the massaging and increased circulation. Love the fragrance too."
3,Smells Great!! Still Waiting for Results,"I think that the product is okay thus far, I haven't noticed much growth. My hair does feel a bit dry days after application, but only days after. It conditions pretty good, but I am still waiting for progress."
2,how to use these products,Hello all i need your help especially from those satisfied customers that has been using eqyss grooming products for awhile with great results on human hair. Just wondering how do i use these products i recently just purchased mega_tek coat rebuilder(2 oz) jar i also purchased megs-tex hoof and mane(16 oz)can i use any of these products for a leave in conditioner and can i leave them when conditioning on for more than just 5 min as stated on bottle. last but not least what should i do with these products for the best results. thanks again for your time
1,This computer is a nightmare,"The HP Pavillion has some kind of flaw in the hard drive that causes continual system failure.I first purchased the Pavillion in Nov. of 2001. It worked for a few weeks, then quit. I have since been through THREE (Yes, you counted right) replacement units with the SAME problem. There is some kind of glitch that causes a system failure. Just yesterday I had the motherboard replaced on the third unit. (It too quit functioning last week.)I can't even allow my children to download any software on this system. It is too fragile/tempermental. I don't DARE download music files or anything else from the internet. We run the unit with fingers crossed and minimal software. Even then it still breaks down. What a disappointment.To top it off, HP customer service (a toll call, btw..) is less than adequate. Nobody there really seemed to know what to say/do when I called with problems.Run from this one. It's a DUD."
4,Cheap and dependable,"I don't know about that other guy (who's on his 3rd one), but I've had the 501n since April of 2002 and so far, I have had 1 system breakdown, which was from user error. As for music downloads, 1.8 gigs of my HD are taken up by music and I have had no trouble. I was disappointed by the low processor speed of 1.2 GHz. I previously owned a mid-priced 1998 IBM with a 2.0 GHz processor. You would think the speed on my 2002 501n would be better!Overall, I don't recommend this one. Steer clear of Windows units all together! Go get yourself a Mac!! They are WAY more stable, faster, user-friendly, and better looking than any Windows system."
2,Not the best camcorder,"We bought one of these a few weeks ago and were quite disappointed. The battery only lasted about 7-8 minutes, and YES, I refreshed and fully charged it and did everything I was supposed to. I don't know if it was a bad battery or if someone had used up it's life and returned it, but I have yet to get a response from the company about it. The picture quality was very grainy as well. It is a cheap camcorder, but in my opinion you don't get even get $200 worth out of this one. I took it back and bought a Sony TRV 280 for a little more and it is AWESOME! Long battery life and great picture quality. Well worth the extra $50!"
3,Review of Compact Camcorder,"It was not clear that the item was reconditioned and did not come with any instructions, battery or lens cover."
5,Funshine was my favorite,When funshine is with the rest of the bears you now you will have a great day all of the bears are great but funshine has that glow about him and he is a boy. We had always that he was a girl but recently read the books and found out he is indeed a boy.
3,Doesn't work all the time,No real instructions came with the device. The watch doesn't fit snugly requiring gerrymandering to keep tight. I believe as a result that the device sometimes stops intermittantly. I am not really happy with it.
4,good paint for your wraping,"dries to a very dark slat , will need to reapply second coat after a week and be sure to dampen the pipe wrape before aplying then allow to fully dry . will smoke when hot first time . over all looks good"
2,Say it isn't so...,I found this book to be interesting and at the same time unrealistic. A grandmother dies leaving her three granddaughters an inheritance of $3 million under the condition that they marry their baby daddy a year to date of the reading of the will. Come on now....
5,Whoa,I read this book in 12 hours...straight! I think Fatima is the luckiest of all three sisters. You'll see why. This book was good.
2,BIG WASTE OF MY TIME....TOO BORING !,"2 stars is being nice...I'M SORRY, but when this book came recommended by one of my ""trusted"" co-workers, I picked it up and was nothing but disappointed that I did! Never will I trust her advice again!...lol..I found myself skipping over too many of the parts, tyrying to get to the ""good"" part that never came.The book was too slow, and the comcept made little sense, especially once you read more about the men in these womens lives...I had to make myself finish this book, so I am skeptical about purchasing anything else by this author unless she redeems herself in the future..Marry your baby daddy was not for me..I will not recommend it to anyone, but I'm fair, so I will let the other readers be the judge.."
3,Hmm....,This book is okay but not really my cup of tea.I was kind of depressed by it and stopped reading it part way through.Maybe it was just me though. :-)
4,Good Easy Read,I enjoyed this book and found it to be an easy read. I was shocked with the decision that Giovanna made. This book was an enjoyable read. Keep up the good work.
4,New and Improved,"KinkyCrafts was one of the more popular Greenery Press books, being that it gave instructions on making an assortment of cheap but effective BDSM toys. However the book went out of print, leaving countless ""amateur toymakers"" in the dark so to speak. Now the book is back in an updated version which contains the 99 old favorites, as well as several new ""do it yourself"" toys.Not only can you learn how to make ""old favorites,"" like various bondage toys, leather paddles, clamps, gags and even the lovely ""bungee dildo,"" but also new items like a basic singletail, a motion detection vibrator and a toy called the ""Titty Tower.""As with its predecessor, the book provides illustrations of the toys, materials needed and assembly instructions. With a little time, money and effort this book provides the reader with numerous ways to build up your toy collection inexpensively."
3,it's ok at best,"there are a few interesting things in it, but it is not worth paying full price for. The illustrations are poor quality, but the instructions are fairly easy to follow. The only thing that redeems this book is the fact that it tells you how to make the finished product out of things that most people have around the house anyway."
5,Movado Watch,"The watch is gorgeous. It's very classy, femine and elegant. It's also very unique as you can't buy it with a mother-of-pearl in a store. Highly recommended!"
4,A wonderful anniversary gift,"I purchased this Movado as an anniversary gift for my wife. It was easy to find after several of my friends mentioned their love for the brand. My wife was very surprised when I sprung it on her at brekafast. Afterwards, we went to the jewelery store to have the band adjusted, which took 15 minutes and about $15. Now, she wears it almost daily. Commenting how it works for any occassions, casual, business or evening. The only time she seems to leave it at home is when we run meaningless errands or do yard work (i.e. doesn't wan to ruin it)."
3,Scratches Easily!,"This is a gorgeous watch but be prepared to only wear it on special occasions. My wife wore it a few times a week when she would have to ""dress up"" a bit for work. This watch scratches VERY easily. Within the first few months it lost all of its original luster and now looks dull and scratched up."
3,"Great watch, Bad Amazon","I ordered & received the watch with no problems. Watch is beautiful and the woman loved it. However, rather than sending me the manufacturers warranty as stated, they sent me an amazon warranty. The difference? I have to send it back to amazon if there is ever a problem rather than being able to bring it directly to a movado dealer which is local to me. This introduces a middle man and thus makes repair times significantly longer than it should be. I have made SEVERAL formal complaints, and amazon has done NOTHING to compensate me for this. They simply stated ""You can send it back for a refund, and we are fixing our site to state the correct warranty"". However, 6 months later the page STILL states ""manufacturers warranty"". So they basically screwed me and tried to offer me a $10 credit for my troubles. $10???? Amazon you suck."
1,Disappointed,"This is my favorite perfume, and I have purchased it online many times through AMAZON. But this product does not smell the same. It is different, even my friends and family agree. I tossed the box or I would have returned the items. Extremly disappointed."
3,Long Night Moon,"I wasn't wrapped in this album. Catie Curtis has a great voice and the production is excellent, but the lyrics and the subject matter were a bit twee. She's obviously rejoicing in life with her kids and all and giving out messages about how great this planet is and how we need to care for it and each other, but listening to this album was a bit like going to a meeting of happy clappers. It didn't work for this Aussie."
4,It works very well for me,"I have owned this for a year and I am very happy with it. I just upgraded my saw with the riser block and Carter bearing guides. I also purchased the Kreg fence and the movable base about the same time I bought the saw. All told, I have about $700 in this saw and it works really well. It is the most veratile tool in my shop."
2,Good Information but Code does not work.,"I found this book very informative and helpful at first. I was initially excited at the depth of the training and the real world examples. There was no ""Hello World"" type of stuff. Unfortunately when it came time to actually practice the training I discovered that the code presented in the book and the on line source, does not work. The syntax is not accurate and it brings into question other information presented in the book. I can only assume that this book and code was based on a very early Beta, and substantial changes were made by Microsoft before the current version of ASP.NET was put on the market."
2,"Ok, but...","The writing style is great and his projects are pretty well thought out. However, I have to downgrade my rating of this book because:1) Appears to be based on an early beta.2) Most of his coding examples produce poorly structure html. To borrow a phrase from the xhtml/xml world, it is not ""well formed."" In other words, it doesn't follow accepted w3 standards.3) His use of CSS is just flat out not right."
1,Unsupported and Outdated?,"I got this book mainly to reuse the GenEditAdd component described in it. However, it seems that the book is totally unsupported now.The author's web site has not been updated recently. The versions of the source code available from the author and the publisher are different, and at least one of those versions appears to be based on a .NET beta.The author's contact email address does not seem to be working. Neither does the contact form on his website."
4,One of my open-on-table books,"I never write reviews, but this is an ex.Message :-)The most helpful part of this book is author's business and architectural approaches.There are some bugs in the code-examples, but!Even if you're not experienced developer you can find and fix them.More you can take it as sudoku puzzles.Only one thing I would consider as a pros - is an examples based on the OLEDB non-SQL provider, which is little bit outdated, for small and medium-size companies.Book is especially helpful for developers who specialized on the in-house extranet applications.With the Best Regards to Author!"
2,Polkas Gritos Y Acordeones,"A nice CD, but not the best Conjunto that I have heard elsewhere. Still, it is well worth purchasing. I bought two of this CD at Amazon.com. One is for a gift. I will find out the opinion of the receiver of the gift and write a new review with his opinion, since he is from Mexico originally."
5,A perfect book,"This is a very important book for my study. In my research field, everyone regard that this book must be read. Today, I have seen some books written by the same authors, but I can't have opportunity to read them. If possible I want to know the authors address. Thank you. sundajun Tianjin University,China"
5,GIANT AT THEIR BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one hell of a live album! Gentle Giant were at their peak around the time of this album. The performances are nearlyflawless. Man, these guys could play!! Every song has at least one or two or three things torecommend about it, but the highlight of this cd is KNOTS ANDTHE ADVENT OF PANURGE. Gary Green and Ray Shulman's acousticguitar duet is amazing!!There are also some very impressive vocal rounds on this, alongwith a section where 3 or 4 of them play recorders. There is avery medieval feel to this song! The version of RUNAWAY is much better than the studio version.This song is heavy in a very YES-like way.Also quite en-joyable is the five man percussion jam on SO SINCERE. Unlikesome of the other prog rock bands, GENTLE GIANT were actually attheir best when they were showing off.I strongly recommend this album; as amatter of fact, I think it's better than any of their studioalbums!!! A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Educating but Scary,"I recently checked this book out from the library. I am 13 so I though it would be a good thing for me to read. Some of the stories were very good, but some were very gruesome and terrifying. There was one story about a girl who was pregnant and killed herself with a hanger. There was another about a hippy named Jessie who thought she had a tampon stuck/lost inside of her because she did ""it"" with a guy while she had a tampon in. Please, any mothers who are thinking about buying/showing this to their daughters, please don't."
4,Greetings from Woodstock Babies,"John just armed with an acoustic/electric guitar on the stage of Woodstock 2 in the wilds of Long Island. Captured for your listening enjoyment by the King Biscuit. Ten years on John rants alot about the original festival and has a very good time singing and givin' out his opinions on Nuclear Power, the 70's and just about everything that pops into his head.Songs featured are: Mobile Line, Welcome Back, Nashville Cat's, Younger Generation, Daydream & Darlin' Be Home Soon. John is not zonked on acid this time and is in fine voice. This is a typical afternoon out of hundreds of gigs he has played. If you like John don't hesitate to pick this one up,FOUR STARS"
4,A Nice Deja Vu,"Sebastian was a favorite of mine in the 60-70's and he relatively faded from view. This CD brought back the good stuff I missed, that wonderful voice smiling through a tough situation. He did better shows, and probably a few worst. This is an average show for him, not much of a backup band, but shows this trooper to be the seasoned veteran of many such difficulty gigs. A real ray of sunshine in a really dark cruel world. If only we could have remained in the mud..."
5,Still one of the best Hip-Hop Comps out there!,"I bought this album back in 2006, and when things get slow (on the hip-hop music selection), I always come back to this CD. It never gets old. For anyone that's looking for a timeless piece of music, pick this up. It's a must-have. Gotta have this in your CD collection."
3,Nice saw for light duty use.,"After purchasing this saw I quickly realized the machine was not powerful enough for my needs. I used the saw three months prior to motor failure. I spoke with Delta and they informed me that the motor was a unique design for the saw and may be overloaded despite using the proper feed rate and without apparent strain during cutting. Using the correct type of blade for the cut you are making is essential, but it is an absolute must if you want this saw to continually work. The table top is small and the lighter weight does not provide the best stability. This saw would be ideal for small projects or hobbies, but falls short for most moderate to large woodworking projects. I returned the saw and bought a Delta contractors saw, which will provide the power and stability I need. I highly recommend Delta tools-just not this saw."
4,Great Product,"My father recommended using Alkalol. It has been so helpful in clearing up sinus infections. Gentle enough to use on babies and a lot cheaper than dr visits and prescriptions.Regarding the nasal douche cup itself, I had one in pink which I liked better. The one I got this time was blue, they had changed the design a bit so it used less plastic and the end which goes into your nasal passage was longer. I didn't like the longer part. Like the older design better."
1,Mis rep?,Cheap! Pricey for what it is...I was in a hurry thought I was getting The liquid Alkahol...hahahaha. If you are looking for a nasal irrigator get the neilmed irrigation bottle. Or a nettie pot this wont do much and will crack at the seams after a couple of uses.
4,Wizard Entertainment has great customer service!,"I purchased this toy for my son. Two days after he received it, one of the legs broke off. I was really disappointed, and e-mailed the company. I received a reply almost immediately, with a big apology and they let me know that a replacement action figure was already on its way. Not only did they replace the broken toy, they included an additional action figure as a token of their apology. I have never received such good customer service. I will certainly shop with them again."
3,Shipping,"Item will not ship to APO's. Doesn't state that in the website anywhere, placed order 2 weeks ago. No toy, called and said order was canceled. Thanks for not notifying me Target, your great. Now its 3 days b-4 my daughters 1st b-day."
2,Pretty weak by SImpsons standards,"Bart the General has no real amusing features at all, although Military types may like the satire. Moaning Lisa overall is too gloomy, and not a great insight into Lisa's character, although like much of the first series it has a truly great scene, where Bart and Lisa debate over which one Maggie loves best, and Maggie makes her verdict clear."
2,Beware. Dark comedy prepackaged as a family film...,"If you think that this is an official representation of the real movie, then look out. On the back of the DVD case are the words: ""This DVD is a home entertainment version of this film. Some footage has been added and some deleted from the theatrical version."" Also, included at the back bottom: ""Some music has been changed."" But cult movies like this don't deserve a DVD makeover so that casual non fans will purchase it.What that says to me is this is an offbeat genre film edited into a clean version of what censoring focus groups think is appropriate for viewers. From now on, Amazon needs to label Home Entertainment Versions like this up front. So consider this the toxic diet video release of the actual film. Avoid it and go get the director's cut instead. Good films are meant to be seen as uncut celebrated originals, not prude police retakes."
1,"THIS, on blu-ray!???!!?","Who in gods name decided the world needs Jimmy Hollywood on blu-ray?? Did someone lose a bet? Terrible, terrible movie. I would give it negative stars if I could. Beware of the positive reviews on here, they reek of studio plants."
3,Is he still acting?,"An aluminum siding salesman Jimmy Alto (Joe Pesci) moves to Hollywood to become an actor. He even rents an ad on a bench. He even comes close a few times to getting a part.The one time he leaves his radio in his car it is misappropriated leaving a broken window in the process. Jimmy upset decides to film the perpetrator in the act. He enlists the help of his forgetful buddy William (Christian Slater). His successes with the operation and the 56 second spot on the news, makes him realize that this is ""Acting"". His friend signed a note to the police with the initials SOS, thus starting the invention of an organization called ""Save Our Streets.Every thing starts to snowball from here. The police thing they are up against another SLA. The people think it is another Charles Bronson. William does not think. Jimmy thinks he is acting. And Jimmy's on and off girl Lorraine (Victoria Abril) thinks he is for real ad does not know it.What do you think?"
5,Pesci's FUNNIEST movie!!,"Im a fan of Barry Levinson movies and this film keeps in the directors' comedic tradition. Say what you want, I know it didn't win any awards and got mediocre reviews but this movie is HILARIOUS! If you sit and watch it you will see its easily Joe Pesci's funniest film!! It has a realistic plot, action and many hilarious lines. I was excited to see this on Blu ray!!"
1,false advertising. Part # HA594245 does not fit on a 2009 scion XB,False advertising. Part # HA594245 does not fit on a 2009 scion XB. the 2009 has 5 lug nut bolt this part has only 4.
3,Doesn't fit a 2008 Scion xB,"Amazon says this fits a 2008 Scion xB, but alas, it does not. This rear hub is most likely for 2005-2006 models only, since it's meant for 4 lug wheels, while a 2008 xB has 5 lugs. Plus, the wheel sensor plug-in is of a different shape than a 2008. It's a fine looking unit otherwise. Five stars if it fit, three stars since it doesn't."
3,Too thick,"Impressed with the quality and firmness. However, the pillow is so thick (I don't think I've ever seen such a wide gusset in my life) that I can't use it for side sleeping, as my head tilts up at an angle and won't level out. I'm a relatively normal sized male, 5'11"", 165 lbs, size 40 jacket, but this thing, as impressively made and stuffed as it is, it is just too thick for me. Even tho I can't use it, I give it 3 stars for quality of construction."
4,doesn't stay fluffy,"I like the volume of the pillow, but it flattens down a little and then you have a big pouf on either side of your head. I like the support it gives in spite of this problem. It is also nice for back sleepers. It does say to fluff it up everyday."
1,Horrible,"Very heavy, right to my garbage, you need to be Charles Atlas to pick them up, what a mistake to try"
2,"TOO SOFT...Head Sinks, Leads to SNORING","Hello Amazonians!Why oh why do I read reviews, then think ""Oh, this will not happen to me!"" and go ahead and buy the item...only to suffer the exact drawbacks my fellow reviewers wrote about?What makes my head lighter than everyone elses'? AND, much more importantly, what makes my HUSBAND'S head lighter than everyone elses'?His head sinks deep into the pillow, tossing his jaw upwards, creating the perfect conditions for SNORING. I couldn't believe how poorly I was sleeping, laying next to the log sawing!!So, if you (or more importantly, your spouse) ever snores, even once, DO NOT get these pillows, they are simply too soft, your head will sink and you will snore."
4,So far I still like it,I've had this pillow for about 2 months and still really like it. keeps it shape and is really comfortable. I have bought so many new ones before this trying to find one that was comfortable and didn't flatten like a pancake after a couple months. Too many to name. Cheap to not so cheap. I would definitely recommend this product for someone who wants good support while staying comfortable as well.
1,It was good while it lasted,"It lasted about a week (may be less). After that it lost it's shape, and any support. It was completely useless. What else can I say?"
4,Big and fluffy,"Bought this for my boyfriend. Loves the size, but after about 3 weeks of use he could tell it was beginning to break down. Not a big deal since he uses this in combination with a few other various pillows."
5,Marshmallow softness!!!,"Actually, I don't typically write reviews, but thought I would in this case. The pillow is very nice, comfortable and has helped with minor allergy issue. The pillow is like a giant marshmallow, can't really think of a better way to define it or give any of you readers a description of how it feels. It really is a good value and product."
1,No good,This product was not what I expected. It says for side sleeping but does not support my neck. I would not recommend. Very dissatisfied.
4,"Nice, soft, pillow...","These pillows are actually pretty decent. It's fluffy, it's soft and it's a king size. Apparently, stores don't normally carry king size pillows (if they do you don't really have a selection) and your little regular size pillows just look silly on the king size bed.These pillows are comfortable, but I definitely notice them ""flatting out"" after a couple months of use. Not enough to get new ones, but enough that you notice. They are still great pillows however and a great price too. Minus one star due to them flatting after a couple months. I'd give it 4.5 stars as it is somewhat minor if I could."
4,well worth the money,"This is one on the best pillows I have ever bought. I ordered only one and after sleeping on it for two weeks, I ordered 2 more one for my husband and one for my son. I'm a side sleeper and I would wake up with a stiff neck but after buying the Beyond Down Gel Fiber Side Sleeper Pillow my aches and pains are gone."
4,Filled well.,"Good overall pillow, very heavy and filled well, I think that most side sleepers will like and sleep better with this pillow."
3,"For the price it's fine, just a little firmer than I would like.","If you like a firm pillow, this one's for you. I wish it could be bunched up and molded more. If you're used to down or down alternative, skip this one."
2,"Nice big pillow, but too soft","Well, I read the reviews and talked myself into buying this pillow for my husband that has a bad neck. I thought it would work well with a cervical collar for sleeping. That is not the case. It is way too soft. He tried it for a week, but couldn't get used to it. Now he is a pretty picky fellow. I thought I would try it and see if he is being a complainer. Turns out he was right. I had to either move to the edge of the pillow or hold it down because you sink in and can't breathe very well. So, since it's a king sized pillow,might have to do alterations, maybe chop it in half and make it better somehow."
4,Good pillow for the price,"I bought this pillow on a whim because it had good reviews. I have to agree that it is a good pillow for the price, but I would doubt it actually retails for $90 or whatever it says on Amazon. It has a good height, and my back doesn't hurt as bad when I wake up, which means my spine must be better aligned. I would buy this pillow again After having experienced it, but I may opt for the queen size next time."
4,Great for side sleeper but not for the stomach sleeper,"I have had this pillow for about 2 weeks. I would describe this pillow as very full and a little heavy. I had no problems fitting it into a pillow case. I would not describe it as super soft like the other reviews have said. Infact, a little softer would be better. I am a side sleeper who flips to my stomach. It is a wonderful pillow for sleeping on your side. Great neck support. Not to hard. When you flip to your stomach, it is not that great. The profile is really high. My hubby is a side and back sleeper and he just loves this pillow. It is still better than memory foam or any other type I have tried."
1,"""Soft"" is the operative word","It was a mistake for me to ignore the word ""soft"" in another review here. These are far too soft for the two side sleepers at our house.In addition to being extremely soft, these pillows are very plump. My head sinks down to the extent that I begin to feel suffocated. And the plumpness (fluffiness? over-stuffed-ness?) causes a logistical problem: a very, very tight fit for king-size shams and pillow cases, so tight that the seams of the pillow cases are stressed. At present, these are in brown shams and the effect is that of having two very fat sausages on the bed.I'm looking to replace these. As a side sleeper, I need more support for my neck. And as the person who changes the linens at our house, I need pillows that don't require me to huff and puff and stuff."
4,Beyond DOwn for sweet dreams,"I love this pillow!!! I am very particuliar about my pillows and have had a hard time finding one that was ""just right"". This one is soft, but supportive, doesn't hurt my neck or smother me in the middle of the night. I have been dreaming more and feeling more rested since I purchased this pillow. Wonderful!! Plus no funky synthetic smells, or poking feathers - the best of all worlds."
3,"Too soft, but nice quality","As a wide shouldered side sleep, I was hoping that a 4.5"" gusset meant I had finally found a pillow that could handle my wide shoulders. Unfortunately, this is WAY too soft for a side-sleeper. I wish that was a little more obvious in the description, as I wouldn't have bought it. It is a very comfortable pillow for a back sleeper though. When I try to watch TV in bed lying on the back, I fall right to sleep. The second I roll on my side, I've got no support though. Nice product, but not for me."
2,Too squishy,"I saw this pillow described as ""soft"" in other comments. Squishy is more like it. My head sinks straight to the bottom with very little support."
2,Great for the first month or two,"I loved this pillow at first, but unfortunately now I find it flat and deflated. My neck is not adequately supported by it. I wonder how many of the higher-star reviews are from people who have had it for a short period of time?I really wish this had maintained its firmness, then I would have rated it 5 stars."
2,Permanent Dent after less than a week's use,I am disappointed that this pillow already has a permanent dip/dent in the middle and now does not support my neck. It has mixed reviews so I thought I'd be one of the happy ones who loved this pillow. No such luck. I woke up this morning with a neck cramp and a screeching headache. A new pillow (the former runner up) has shipped!
1,"made head hurt, neck hurt",could actually feel the gel balls inside. Made head hurt. Definitely not a side pillow. Would not recommend. Waste of money
2,A little over the edge.,"I have loved all the books in the SEAL Team Seven series. However, the later you get in the series, the more preposterous the storylines get. I was OK with a female going on the mission, but the hypnosis thing was ridiculous. Douglass should spend more time developing his stories before churning out new ones. It is still an enjoyable read, but a little over the edge."
3,"It's less complete than""Live at Carnagie.."",but is memorable","Well actually the right rate should be 3 stars and 1/2: anyway it's less complete than ""Live at the Carnagie Hall"", remaining anyway memorable!! You find a lot improvisations in the classic suite ""Ashes are burning""; moreover you can appreciate an old ""cut"" of Prologue (to me it's not so much essential, but nevermind ...)and almost the whole best stuff from ""Turn of the cards"", as usual. Unfortunately ""Touching once"" and ""You"" don't add anything new to their classic ""song-format"", while I would have appreciated a new version od Scheherazade, here not present and it's a pity !!Recommended to all the Renaissance's fans, but it's not an essential place to start ..."
2,Scraps from the Prison Table,"A fanatically dedicated scholar would be able to wring some bits of information about the experience of Confederate prisoners of war at Johnson's Island from this unbelievably prolix and digressive text, but it probably wouldn't be worth the experience. This is logorrhea that could sink the Merrimac. Political rants, racist diatribes (thankfully rare in Civil War primary texts, including Confederate), reminiscences and pointless philosophizing flow without rhyme, reason or apparent end.An appendix on conditions at Camp Chase is much clearer and more informative, but unfortunately does not constitute first-hand evidence."
3,The second release,This was phgp second release and it isn't quite as good. They miss Mike alot but they still crank out some pretty good songs. This cd is worth it for the Mahogany cover and Walking contastrophe which sounds like an old school punk song that green day couldve easily penned and made a hit. I would only get this album if you are a die hard fan or want to complete your collection you might like this better than i do.
3,"blah, blah, blah","Personally, I am not that fond of Billy Joe or Green Day. Were they not commercially successful I would not feel this way, but I do because I secretly resent their success. But a friend of mine plays in this band so I listened to it. The line-up of this band is good... particularly Aaron Cometbus (ex-Crimpshrine) and Jason White (ex-Chino Horde.) So the music is not going to be bad. If you like Green Day, you'll like Pinhead Gunpowder because they sound a lot alike. But then again, Green Day sounds a lot like most other bands hailing from the East Bay, it's just that they get paid more than anyone else for sounding that way. Truth be told though, this album contains probably the best cover of Diana Ross' ""Mahogany"" set to record and makes the purchase worth every penny."
3,"Great design, bad machining and parts","I owned one of these in my old shop that ran great over several years.So I decided to get another one when I moved. Big mistakeAfter the minimal required setup, I checked that the spindle was square to the table. It was not.I called the customer service at Delta and the ""phone person"" asked a tech who didn't know but thought maybe...?There is no adjustment to square the tool up!The one adjustment capability (not for squaring but for up-and-down guide) had plastic machine screws with plastic lock nuts. This had been overtightened at the factory and the screw fell apart in my hand.I finally got the tool working, but because it isn't square it's a useless tool and I'm sending it back.I'll try to get a replacement that is square because I really liked my old one. Maybe there's hope."
5,Solid performance,"These faucets are build to last.In resent years we see a huge increase in theamount of plastic faucets from China, they are cute but they are garbage.If you are looking for a faucet that will last 25 years plus without any problems,then this is the kind of faucet what you want."
4,very good product,The Leg elevator we bought from Amazon is very good- it stays in place and is so helpful. It has improved my husband's leg circulation. He recently had knee replacement surgery in both legs. A stack of pillows hardly worked- the pillows did not stay in place.
4,DOES ITS JOB,6 INCHES COMFORTABLE I WAS WORRIED THAT IT WOULD BE TOO LOW BUT FEELS A LOT HIGHER THAN I EXPECTED. REALLY GOOD FOR TIRED SWOLLEN LEGS FROM LONG DAYS STANDING OR FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO HEAL LEG SORES.DOES NOT FIT INTO STANDARD KING PILLOW CASE.
4,Great for the lower back!,"This product does exactly what it is designed to do. My only issue is the cover is made with really slippery fabricate. If you're a big person, you'll find your legs slip off pretty easy."
5,Miracle pillow!,"I noticed the very first time I woke up using this pillow that my ""stiff back in the mornings"" was completely gone! I've had this pillow for 2 weeks now and absolutely love it. Best purchase I've made in a long time. Easily worth a five star rating. The price of the pillow was well worth it, I just wish the shipping was cheaper but it isn't cheap to ship a pillow of that size anyway."
3,"Soft on the legs, but a little too high........","This leg elevator is soft on the legs, but a too high for me to sleep comfortably.I guess I should have gotten a smaller height.The only reason I could see using this height of 8 inches is if you had cast on your leg, and you had to elevate your leg to prevent swelling. Otherwise a smaller size might be more comfortable to sleep with."
1,Review of leg elevator,"It is cumbersome to use and store. The person I gave it to said itwas not easy to use, and was awkward to get into the bed with it.I would not purchase it again. Actually I rate it no stars."
5,Loved it!,"The leg elevator is exactly as described. It is firm and comfortable. It arrived promptly too. The cover could be made of more durable material, or an additional cover would be nice. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase."
3,"beware, no solutions","Good book, but no solutions to any exercises. Usually Springer books do have some solutions, so it was a bit disappointing."
5,"Explicit, gradual, well-organized, and fun","This book has been a huge help in my introduction to analysis class. It gradually eases students into the material, covering some basics that may need to be reviewed before diving in to a phenomenally organized exploration of analysis."
3,"Adequate, but missing solutions is frustrating.","It's a good introductory book, but it leaves a prodigious amount of the Theorems as exercises. This makes studying out of the book very difficult in a time crunch. Still, easy to understand the explanations that are given."
1,A book which is too unfocused for beginners,"I attempted to teach out of this book and my students found it difficult since many of its exercises aren't properly prefaced in the sections for which they were intended. The ordering of the ideas is also haphazard and the general presentation assumes far more mathematical knowledge and familiarity with basic concepts than can be gleaned from its pages alone. An extension to the introductory section on set theory and mappings would be helpful to the presentation. Many sections are unnecessarily chatty in the wrong places and unfocused. It is an inexpensive book, but Bartle and Sherbert's masterful introduction is well worth 5 times its price."
4,Good intro book if you're looking for some explanation/context,"This is the only analysis intro I've found with a good amount of explanation and context to go along with the definitions-theorems-proofs. Thus, I think it works well as a first analysis text. It's not an easy book, things move pretty fast, and a lot of times proofs are left as exercises which you wish were spelled out. Also, it'd be nice if there were answers to the exercises. But if you're looking for a user-friendly intro to analysis, this is the best one I've come across."
1,Some things should have been left alone . . .,"I am a long-time Supertramp fan, starting in 1975 with Crime of the Century, and ending sometime in the late 80's, when Live '88 nearly killed my appreciation of this band.I bought this new CD with renewed hope, but sat stunned and slightly depressed as I listened to it. There is nothing innovative in this CD. There are some tracks that make a mockery of their once-great sound, and much of the other material just makes no musical sense to me.There may be some people out there who will enjoy this music, but only because they didn't grow up listening to Supertramp as it formed a part of their lives. I don't want to tell people not to listen to it, but I think they ought to hear some tracks first; buying this CD on the basis of what Supertramp once was will be met with disappointment."
4,"""Or The Rick Davies Jazz Ensemble""","Whilst browsing through the local record store I came across this album. Great I thought, a new Supertramp album. I wonder what they sound like after all these years? The answer is that they still have Rick Davies on vocals but forget the old Supertramp sound. This is much more jazzy and laid back. There are snatches of what most people will be expecting (you win, I lose for example) but if you are not prepared to accept a change of direction then you will be dissapointed by this album. I was very unsure whether I liked it or not on the first couple of plays. However, this is an album that definitely grows on you. Probably not for Supertramp purists but a good effort all the same."
5,FANTASTIC!,I do not know what some of those other people are talking about...this is as good as they EVER were! some of the best effects in pop are on this album! Flawlessly recorded! Beautiful Stuff...GET IT! They really must have been practicing all those years.
2,Looking for Classic Supertramp? Don't get this album.,"This is nothing more than a glorified Rick Davies solo album. With the exception of You Win, I Lose, there is no ""Supertramp"" content on this album. Mark Hart is definitely no Roger Hodgson and the fact that Rick Davies tries to pass this album off as a Supertramp album is nothing more than an insult to the intelligence of classic ""Supertramp"" fans.If you are looking for some classic ""Supertramp"" material, you're better off obtaining Roger Hodgson's solo albums, because you're not getting any from this album."
3,Everything Changes,"Like a couple of the other reviewers, I was disappointed by my first listen to this CD. I skipped from song to song looking for the old Supertramp energy and didn't find it. BUT, taken on its own without comparison to what went before, this is good music. I like the variety of the instrumentation and the clean, bright sound of all the tracks. I agree with another review in that there is nothing really new in the melodies or lyrics, but the quality of the production more than makes up for it. The old Supertramp innovativeness isn't there, but compared to almost all the new music coming out these days, this CD is actually a breath of fresh air!"
2,They certainly changed from awesome to terrible,"Luis Mejia (son) - Supertramp's reform really got unnecessary in terms, at last they didn't produced something good and their reasons for reforming gets only in mind with the idea that they got something exciting and new, even that hope of listening to the Supertramp masterpieces as Crime Of The Century slightly got onto my mind. Well, nothing like it; Rick Davies went still in the band, at least, but this record and this ""Supertramp"" reform was completely unnecessary; Some Things Never Change is a really misleading effort which hits nothing but a plain commercial (but unsuccessful) jazzy melodies with a terrible, nauceatic funk style. ""You Win, I Loose"", which got some radio airplay, and ""Sooner Or Later"" are the only very least hits but far plain this is a dissapointing album to skip."
1,What happened!!,"I have been a Supertramp fan since 1975!! I have every ALBUM up to Brother where you bound--and EVERY CD. BUT........this is the worst one yet!!! I can't even listen to 1 full track!!! I would take it back if I thought I could!! I'm sorry, but I hope they don't continue to release CD's with this type of music on it....Please go back to your roots and start again!!! I was really looking forward to a good CD, but I guess I'll have to wait another 10 years!!"
1,1.5 stars- Kind of a lame effort,"This albums like Sominex, It will definitely put you to sleep. They need to have another vocalist to sing some of the songs so Rick Davies doesn't have to sing on every song. The songs on here are not up tempo enough and are kind of lazy and jazzy and just pretty boring stuff. It would be great if Roger Hodgson would return because they could really use him these days. They have a couple of really long songs of which one is over 9 minutes in length and the other is over 8 minutes, and that's getting pretty long for Supertramp songs. Just stick with all of Supertramps albums from the 70's because they blow the 80's and 90's stuff out of the water."
3,For many of the songs they are not the supertamp i know.,"Since this is their latest album with rick taking the lead and with rogers absence in many of the songs present in this album you will not find the supertramp that you know alive in them. But surly you will find them living in : its a hard world, you win i lose, get your act together, and live to love you, which i believe are the cream songs of this album."
4,Don't smoke this shoe,"This is a good comfortable lightweight shoe. Hemp has been touted to be a more durable material than cotton, so I am hoping that this shoe will last a long time. A great color to go with green or brown outfits."
3,No cover art,No cover art. Don't like that. Wanted cover art. Did not see that it came without in the ad for the product.
1,What a waste of time,"I followed the setup instructions meticulously, adjusted the blade guides, tension, etc. carefully. First thing I noticed when I turned it on was the vibration in the terribly unbalanced machine. Next, as other reviewers noted, it will not track a straight line, nor vertical, either freehand or with a fence. And even if it did, the vibration is such that a freehand cut will never be smooth. I've worked with power tools for 29 years, made clocks, furniture and cabinets, and I have to say this is the worst quality power tool I've ever seen. There is no excuse in packaging a machine so defective that the first thing you have to do is send it in for service. Fortunately the store gave me a refund a couple days after I bought it."
1,Save your $ and get something better...,"I bought this saw a year ago when I was first setting up my small shop. I've used it quite a bit - and I've been frustrated to the point of madness by it. Honestly - I wouldn't *give* this saw to anyone I like.As noted in earlier reviews, the saw WILL NOT cut a straight line, even when I clamp a board on the table for a makeshift rip fence. The blade always seems to track to the left. The machine exhibits a noticible wobble - it has from the get-go. I think one of the wheels is out of round. It does not have sufficient power to cut hardwood or plywood over 1/2 thick without bogging down or stopping altogether.My advice - Jet makes a good bandsaw for about $300, and a great one for $500. Save your $$ and get a saw that will work well for a lifetime. This has been an expensive lesson for me..."
2,Almost worthless...,"I have owned this band saw for almost three-years, and it is the most frustrating mechanical device I've ever encountered! It cuts fast and smooth, but it will not cut a straight line no matter what I do. I've changed blades (a Delta website suggestion) and made countless adjustments following the owner's manual. Using the fence, the blade will track at least 1/2"" from a straight line on a 4"" cut in 1"" soft pine. This one experience has soured me on Delta products."
2,"Delta 9 "" not worth the money","It is very difficult to find blades of different sizes if you can find them. The standard is the 14"" band saw.It is very difficult to change the blades without the blade coming off when starting it up not matter how carefully you do it. The cool blocks and guides are useless due to the wander of the blades. I haven't even attempted to resaw. I would suggest a Grizzly 9"" or just spend the money for a 14"", unless you are sure you will use it very seldom and on very small stock. Miter gage is not usefull since you cannot cut a straight line."
3,Spend extra and buy better!,"When I told my wife I could buy this for about $100, she asked if this model would be good enough. I should've taken the opportunity and upgraded!I only use it to get close to the mark and use a pattern following router bit to finish because this saw isn't accurate enough for finish cuts. I haven't had the problems some of the other reviewers have, but I can see it happening with enough time.If you are really limited on budget this will work, but if you have the money, buy better."
2,"Delta 9"" bandsaw - not happy with it","I bought the Delta 9"" bandsaw for home woodworking duty. I have not been happy with it. Within days the blade guides began breaking, then AFTER I ordered replacements I was informed they were not available. I wound up making my own. Despite exhausting alignment efforts, the blade constantly pulls to the inside of the saw during cuts and ripping operations are impossible. In addition, the blade gets pulled backwards and nearly totally off track when the workpiece is repositioned when freehand cutting. This occurs pretty much regardless of blade used.The one nice thing I will say is that the dust collector feature works very well.I really don't like this bandsaw, and I know what I'm doing."
2,Delta 9 inch Band saw,I've owned this saw for 3 years now. Its okay but requires a lot of adjustment and does a have a significant problem with blade tracking. My biggest complaint is the inability to buy replacement parts. For example blade guides are impossible to find. Everybody has parts for 14 inch saws but not for this one. I wouldn't recommend this saw; its only real advantage is price and in this case you don't get what you pay for. Buy a 14 inch band saw instead.
3,OK Saw - not very durable,I have had this saw for about two years. One tuned up (as another reviewer mentions) and with good blades it works quite well. Major problem is with the pulley for the lower wheel - the connection to the motor is plastic - mine has broken twice. The first time under warranty - we;ll see what happens trying to get it fixed a 2nd time. My main reason for choosing this saw was light weight - very small shop so I have to be able to move and store it easily. On thin light wood it is a champ. Even minor resawing tends to challenge it.
4,Great grater,A great idea for grater design. Works well unless you try to put somewhat soft mozzarella through it. Oops. Easy to clean and seems to be well built.
3,Somewhat of a dissappointment,"I know that microplane has an excellent reputation, so was excited when I saw the box grater. However, it does not live up to my expectations. It is large and somewhat awkward. The slider attachment is difficult to use and practically useless. Also, it is difficult to clean. It is not worth the price....buy one of the hand held graters instead."
5,Inspirational Life,"Mother Antonia is an inspiration for us to see all people as fellow humans with similar needs - to be cared for, loved, and accepted. I appreciate that she paved the way to be valuable at an ""older"" age, and she welcomes women in their later years as valuable and able to serve others. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and passed it around among many friends."
1,Be Careful....,"I spent three days in Tiajuana with this nun -- and I ran away, as fast as I could. 'Mother' Antonia s not what she appears to be. She loves the attention she attracts more than anything else. She could do with some long-time mental health treatment. On the other hand, she is doing good, so what the heck, right?"
3,A handful of characters study set at Heathrow Airport...,"Much of the action focused on a romantic triangle involving a pampered wife, a wealthy husband, and a penniless playboy lover...Liz once again is the neglected wife, comforting herself with a lover (Jordan)... When the destitute husband is threatened by his wife's departure who has given her diamonds instead of affection, Burton shows he cares... Liz, unyielding however; wants him to suffer...Taylor's performance is cool and serene... Her face undisturbed by normal human expression... Playing an instigator of male insecurity, she is, for a change, altogether lovely to look at...Maggie Smith plays the trusty secretary in love with her Australian boss Rod Taylor... Orson Welles's arrogant character provides the comic relief... Margaret Rutherford won a Best Supporting Oscar for her delightful role as the eccentric elderly duchess..."
2,Boring and droning,"This is an extremely dated film which is interesting solely because of the real life drama going on behind the scenes with Taylor and Burton. The plot of the movie is droning, boring and the sets look like something out of a campy Asutin Powers film. The dialogue limps along like a crippled brontosaurus and is delivered by the major actors in a catatonic state. Pay particular attention to the perenially-inebriated Richard Burton, who appears (and was) drunk in every single scene. The airport piece between he and Liz in the waning minutes of the film shows him weaving, mumbling and behaving in a completely irrational manner. Unintententionally hilarious!As previously stated, the only riveting prospect of this movie is that Liz and Richard had wrapped up ""Cleopatra"" and were searching for a convenient movie where they could co-star and continue living together at the Dorchester Hotel in London. Never mind that this movie is a bloated turkey, Avoid it!"
2,Almost as bad as Louis Jordan's...,"Rumor has it that Liz hated doing love scenes with Louis Jordan because his breath stank up the joint. This movie has a habit of doing the same thing.The only reason Burton and Taylor agreed to star in this insipid soap opera is because it afforded them the oportunity of continuing their affair begun on ""Cleopatra."" The movie was made in England, which also helped Liz avoid American taxes (a perenial concern of hers).Burton gives yet another indifferent performance, though he doesn't over act here as badly as he usually does. Liz is beautiful but visibly bored with the silly lines she speaks, such as ""I never thought about love. It's a concept out of the dark ages."" Tell that to your 8 husbands, Liz.If you want to see Burton and Taylor in a quality movie, check out ""Who's Afraid of Virignia Woolf,"" the only outstanding movie they ever made."
4,Francis of Assisi by Omer Englebert,"I don't want to get into arguments about which (who?) is the greatest saint. Certainly there may be those who opt for Francis ""the little poor man,"" and equally as certainly anyone interested will learn from this book that Francis was a great saint. Francis was loving, kind, tough and holy. Francis called himself (in the book) the greatest or maybe worst sinner, which he certainly was not. Englebert takes us from Francis's early fantasies about become a knight and growing -- with knightly honor -- into one of the greatest of the saints. Starting out on his own, eventually gathering a small band of followers be began perhaps best known of all religious communities, eventually sending missionary brothers to many nations. By choice he lived in poverty, but through this excellent biography, leaves us (readers) greatly enriched."
2,Pretty much someone else's opinion.,I wanted to read the account of Francis because I'm forever seeking to know how to be closer to God. Is voluntary poverty what God desires? Why does God seem so far away and seem to intervene in the world so little? Why do Christians so easily agree on the life and death of Christ and eternal salvation yet remain so divided and powerless? I was hoping this book would be an example of how to be closer to God. For the most part it just portrays status quo religion in the 1200's which is no better than the less than lukewarm religion we see today. I'm not sure if God is so impressed with piety and self inflicted suffering. It's an interesting story about a humble man and those who chose to follow his example.
2,Book also seems to have occasional agenda to justify Church dogma,"I was somewhat disappointed with this biography. In addition to telling the biography, it also occasionally seems to have an agenda which is to justify and promote Church dogma or stands. Some pages are just spin to justify massacres authorized by the Church. Probably written by a committed Catholic cleric."
5,An Up-to-Date Biography of St. Francis of Assisi,The author not only provides a spiritual insight into St. Francis' life but also details the many historical facts of his life. The book also has an excellent index for researching facts about St. Francis. Our Secular Franciscan Fraternity distributes this book to people inquiring into the Secular Franciscan Order
1,Deceiving!,Need to put that hair bows were for pets. Can't tell from the picture or the title. disappointed.
4,Not bad 1981 Pattinson,"Frank Stride is shipwrecked on an island and as he realises he will probably die soon remembers flashbacks inspired by various scars on his body of his eventful life. At 18 he was a war hero in the Navy who lost three toes, at 28 he is kidnapped and forced to smuggle weapons to Cuba, other scars were formed as the result of other spectacular and life changing events which Stride relives in detail.James Pattinson books vary drastically in quality but this is not a bad effort and a worthwhile purchase. Pattinson writes in an old man style where his characters use words that show Pattinson is obviously from a previous generation and not quite down with the lingo of today but this style does add something unique and enjoyable to his novels. Other high quality Pattinson novels worth your time and money are Skeleton Island, The Time of Your Life, Obituary for Howard Grey, Crane, The Animal Gang, Blind Date, The Golden Reef and Life Preserver."
3,TOO BIG!!,This thing is huge....I just received it and it's going back right away. It's like a small suitcase but a sleeker design. It does have all the things described and would be a great buy if it wasn't so big. I already have a toddler and newborn to worry about there's no need to add something so bulky.
3,Big bag. Not cute,Nice quality bag. But it's not cute. The bag is bigger than I expected. It feels and looks more like a carry-on bag.
3,Motorhead - 'King Biscuit Flour Hour' (King Biscuit),"I'm giving this disc a three star rating because after listening to it,I honestly believe that Lemmy and drummer Phil Taylor are doing their BEST while having to put up with guitarist Brian Robertson.Hiring Robertson was apparently a big mistake for the band.'King Biscuit...' was recorded live in Queens,N.Y. sometime in summer,1983 at probably some sleazy night club.The sound on this seven track disc is okay,but the gig is WAY to short,even for Motorhead.The best tracks,I thought were ""Iron Horse"" and ""I Got Mine"".The interview with Lemmy is so-so.Meant for Motorhead completists."
5,Motorhead mk III,"This is Motorheads 3rd line-up change and thier ""Worst"" according to ""Lemmy & Fans"" But this Motor-Maniac truly enjoyed it! ""Robbo"" adds another dimension to the motorhead sound that seemed to be missing,and you can still hear his influence's on later albums. This particular show was recorded by the ""King Biscuit Flower Hour' and broadcast live on the radio.They have added an interview with ""Lemmy"" that I found to be very insightful!"
5,Love this disc,"I am in love with this disc. I'm a disc golfer first, ""frisbee"" thrower second, so this is a nice in-between for when I want to play catch but still have the feel of a golf disc. The rim feels a little like an Innova Birdie, but the plastic is softer, and the diameter of the disc is significantly larger (still not as big as a 175 Ultimate style disc).I had a memorable summer day throwing this around in a big field with a buddy of mine. You can really lay into it and get it to go about as far as a mid-range driver, but of course it doesn't hyzer out as hard and its easier to catch because it slows down and doesn't have as sharp an edge.A note on our memorable summer day: a cute girl walked by and said something to the effect of: ""wow, I've never seen one go that far"". Yes, I'm implying that buying this disc will help you pick up chicks. No, I have no shame."
1,bad motor,Easy to slow belt when sanding - aka low power. Motor burned up with 3 years of very infrequent light duty work - wooden bird houses and boxes. Motor began emmiting smoke with no load as soon as it was turned on with ambient temp of 40F. Delta Shopmaster products are thier low cost lines. I thought a simple Delta product for $90 would last longer.
2,iffy,"to the point, this machine has a plastic drive wheel. I got a small piece of wood jerked out of my fingers (my fault) and it wedged the belt and stopped it (safety built in). However, that stripped the plastic drive wheel. After that, anything above slight pressure on the sanding piece and the belt/disc stopped. I didn't want to go through the hassle of begging Delta for an exchange, so I fixed it with JB Weld. Now it works fine. The discovery of the flimsy construction has kept me from considering Delta anything."
2,Motor Burnout,Purchased this sander and used it for light sanding only on small parts. Not many hours of use in two years when the warranty ran out. But so did the motor. It costs more for a motor than the whole sander so be aware that this is what I would consider a throw away tool.
2,"Katherine is my wife, Bruce is writing:","Two stars, hey this is a cheap tool. If you buy it and plan on doing any work with it, get ready to adjust then adjust the other way, they just when you think you have it, adjust again.And if that isn't enough, watch the belt dig into the plastic housing as it begins to fray. That's the only way it'll run steady. We had this machine at school and when the belt ran out against the dust housing too long it severed the plastic collector from together to part. I love having a stationary belt sander. I used to clamp my porter cable in my vise to have a sander, but bought the Delta 4 inch. We had motor failure at work on another, and belt problems on the plastic open gear drive. Well, now that I think of it, this really rates only one star. Buy a real machine, this is almost the toy variety, come on Delta, remodel this thing we don't mind paying a little more."
1,expected more from delta,"I've owned this sander for four months now and it has been down waiting for parts for two of those months. The driven pulley is made of cheap plastic with plastic splines on a metal shaft. The plastic pulley wore out after only light use, it began to get off center and destroyed the drive belt. Both parts have been on order for over a month. The motor on this unit is under-powered, you can easily stop the belt with almost any sanding operation. The overall guality of this sander is poor, but I must say, I should have known based on the price. You get what you pay for with tools. Poor quality, underpowered, parts???"
2,Buy something else.,"Cheaply made to say the least.I have had this sander for less than a month and the plastic gear pulley is stripped. Even the slightest pressure bogs it down. I am only using it at home on small pieces and expected much more from this machine. The platen is very uneven, I didn't expect it to be precision ground but this is ridiculous. Save your money and buy a Jet or something."
1,Don't buy this tool.,"I bought one of these a few years ago and hardly ever used it. I finally started using it recently, but just barely, and the engine burned out -- just a big blue puff of smoke..."
1,12 hours and dead,"I have always loved Delta tools. I got this unit as a giftand thought that it would be a pretty decent inexpensive piece ofequipment. Judging by the previous reviews , I would say that Iwould pass on this unit. Within 6 hours of use I had a drive beltfail and decided to drive an hour to get a batch of replacement beltsseeing that Delta was going to charge me $10 each to ship a $5 replacementbelt. About 6 more hours of use ( occasional over a period of a year )the motor started rattling and smoking. I am serious ..... about a dozenhours of casual use. Sad"
5,Exellent for the cost,"I am 14 all most fifteen and have a dream of having a really big wood working shop and got this 4""belt 6"" disc sander for xmas. I have used it a fair amount for halping my brother with cub scouts pine wood derby and have been very pleased, so has my father. The only complante is that the disc has come dis ingaged from the moter thougth still spins with no torque. This my have been my own falt in any case buy it, and not expect top of the line preformense out of it. You get what you pay for. A exellent buy. Suggestion buy a large assortment of belt and discs of diferent grits."
2,Entertaining but certainly not survival techniques,"As it stands this series is very entertaining, but it is such chiefly because of the production values. You are laughing at the presenter not with him as he puts his life in danger for the sake of drama and viewing figures. The majority of the activities illustrated in this series are not best practices in a survival situation and many could kill you if you tried to implement them. Approach this DVD for entertainment value and you will get something out of it. If you plan to go adventuring and want to learn survival techniques, steer well clear of this series."
5,Yummy Book!,This is a really good book about Risotto. The recipes range from light to deliciously heavy and creamy. There are also very basic instructions and tips for the beginning Risotto maker.
4,A risotto primer,"Five stars for covering some basic risottos and a lovely pic for every one. However, other books on the topic offer a more expansive index of recipes along with expansive info on the history, geography, and the kinds of risotto rices used and the reasons why...this 'know how' just accentuates the risotto experience which obsessive Foodies like me like to be privvy to. Note too that each recipe is meant to feed a large family or a crowd, using 3 cups uncooked risotto rice, that makes a ton of risotto. I'm cooking for just two, so I have to cut in half or thirds all of the measurements from start to finish, a bit of a bother. Otherwise, this is a no-frills, uncomplicated way to jump in and get your risotto toes wet."
5,W-S Risotto Cookbook,"This cookbook was a gift for our daughter-in-law. Good cookbook, easy to follow, with great recipes. We would purchase it again."
1,ho hum,"Just ordinary recipes. Format sucked, recipes listed at the spine edge in small type with way to much ""explanation"". Not kitchen user friendly at all."
5,Great ingredient,"I use the plain-flavored product to make my own protein bars. It combines with the other ingredients very well. I love the enormous package, as I don't have to buy another one very often. Also, the large aperture of the package makes it easy to insert a scoop and your hand in order to measure out a quantity. I have no complaints about it, it works exactly as I would expect it to."
4,Great protien suppliment,"I got this for 3 reasons.1: It is soy, not whey. I am allergic to dairy, so this is a must. I am satisfied on this aspect.2: Its price. This brand offers products at very affordable prices.3: No junk added. This was the biggest selling point. The flavored options have lots of artificial sweeteners and all sorts of chemicals to make it taste good. This unflavored product has only one thing in its ingredients list, Soy protein isolate. I love that.This is fine for adding to smoothies, though it does foam up A LOT in the blender, doubling the volume of my smoothies. If you like drinking foam, this is good for you. If you don't, I suggest adding it at the very end of the blending process. I also add it to things like pancake batter and bread dough. Its unflavored, so you don't notice its there (just add a touch more liquid), but it amps up the protein content and makes things more filling."
3,Soy protein,"It shipped great, arrived in tact on time. Not the best tasting powder out there. Unless you like cardboard. But for the price it's good enough. I have mixed it with soy milk, water, juice, and coffee. Just changes the taste to cardboard. But it keeps me from getting hungry, and gives me 20g of protein what else can you ask for?"
2,Too hard to mix.,I normally order the Pea Protein and it's great because it mixes easily in milk however I must have orered the Soy and have been disappointed each time i try to mix it up.Most of the powder just stays on the top. yucky.
2,"Mixes OK, but the taste is awful","I chose NOW instead of ON because ON was a bit difficult to mix. The NOW mixes better, but the flavor and texture are harsh. It tastes like ground Styrofoam, with a little chocolate in it. After 2 min of struggle to throw up or not, it eventually settles in my stomach."
1,Doesn't mix well,Doesn't mix well. No matter how hard i try it just forms lumps in water. The same brand's Whey protein isolate is an excellent alternative.
5,"Mixes well, great product","I've been using this for close to two weeks now and really like it. I have been using another brand for ""shakes"" but wanted something I could add to juice that wasn't vanilla or chocolate and thus would ruin the flavor. Straight out of the jar it tastes a little like cardboard, remember ""unflavored"" doesn't mean it doesn't have a flavor of its own - just that they don't add particular flavoring to it. Along with juices or other flavored beverages (I've actually added this to Propel water - different flavors - and it worked out just fine). Adding it to plain water doesn't yield a very pleasurable flavor experience but you could do that if you don't mind it or if you're drinking quickly. The powder itself is very fine (the finest I've seen in any protein powder) and mixes without any fuss at all. Plus, it's soy based, so it doesn't give me gas like a milk product would in its place. I certainly recommend this product and the brand as a whole."
3,A little concerned about soy,"I really like this protein shake, but had to give it only 3 stars because of my concern with soy and female hormones. I have read quite a few articles about how soy can mimic the female hormone estrogen in the body. That isn't necessarily a good thing for someone trying to lose weight (and could cause other issues also). I have problems with gluten and dairy products so thought I would try this. It mixes fairly well with just water and the taste is not that bad. I would continue to use if it wasn't for the hormonal concern."
1,Absolutely Awful,"This product taste chalky, grainy, and absolutely awful in smoothies. I would not recommend getting the unflavored soy protein for anything."
1,Inedible...,"Purchased this to try a whey/soy mixed smoothie. Brought back my old memory of head-sliding into home base on a hot summer day. Nothing but chalky and dusty. It's not that I'm not used to soy. In fact it's in my Asian blood. I grew up eating tofu and other soy stuffs. I can drink soy milk without a problem. This product is something completely different. If you want to give unflavored soy isolate a try, I recommend you to visit your local health food store and purchase similar powder sold by the grams. If you need to purchase something in addition to your whey protein to quality for free shipping, add a post-it or something to your cart instead of this 2 lb jug."
2,Other Books,"Mage The Ascension was a fairly groundbreaking game, to me. Just like the GURPS version of Vampire the Masquerade, Steve Jackson's shot at transporting a White Wolf game to their system just did not seem to measure up, which was a shame, as integrating that into other areas of GURPS would have been pretty cool. An example of an attempt that failed."
4,Hate to Burst Your Bubble,"No offence to Robert M. Schroeck, but just buy the original game. The GURPS version is good, but seriously the game was designed under a COMPLETELY different dice mechanic. The original Mage the Acension is VERY good, with a huge amount of support, most of it quite good. So if you want to play a Mage game, buy the original. But if you want REALLY powerful Magick Users in your GURPS campaign get this book."
3,Learn to Please Your wife,"Bought my wife a massage table and I got this CD to learn how to do it. It may not be the spa at the Ritz, but my wife enjoys the massages I give her almost as much and a lot more often. It isn't that hard to learn to give a fair massage if you watch this CD. With a little practice you'll even give a good one. Add a selection of lotions, some Desert Spa music or rainforest sounds, and some scented oils and your wife will feel like she is at an expensive spa. Now if you can exchange your beer belly for some washboard abs, she may prefer your massage over the one from the muscle man at the spa that charges $200 an hour."
1,Started to come apart the first time I used it,"This pumice sponge seems less like a ""sponge"" than a piece of the stuff used in the bottom of fake flower arrangements to keep the flowers upright. The first time I used it, ""dust"" from the sponge came off and got on my floor. Seems like a very cheap product that will not last long."
5,Very nice.,This pumice sponge is very gentle. If you have tender skin and can not use rough pumice sponges this one is made for you. I love it.
1,"Really, really inferior.",I have purchased a pumice like this before and was very pleased but apparently it was not this brand or this brand has deteriorated dramatically in quality.I was sent an orange shade pumice- when I used it the first time the color came off on my skin. A LOT. My feet were orange. Bits of the pumice come off on first use- and as you use it it disintegrates on your skin. As a result the exfoliation you get is not the best. Its a messy and inferior product- my advice is to avoid.
5,An oldie but a goodie,"Chocolate Cake for Breakfast is my all time favorite cd by Toni Land. If you like her work, which everyone should and if you don't you're crazy, this is a classic. All of the tracks stand out in their own way, especially Trade Places. It makes me remember my care free days as a child and brings back all sorts of great memories. Here's a little know fact for all you Land fans: the back up vocals were done by her niece and her nieces friend. Fabulous, just fabulous! I tell you, that niece of hers has real talent. I bet you anything she goes far in life. Anyway, Toni Land is fabuolous and that's really all you have to say. If you haven't already added this gem to your collection I strongly suggest you do so. You won't be sorry."
3,"a cheap, but decent saw","I bought this delta saw about a year ago for an simple remodle job. I was just getting into woodworking and didnt have much money, so the delta looked pretty nice. after getting hime and putting it together if found that the stand was totaly unsatasfactory...so built my own out of heafty 4x4's and 3/4"" plywood, this made a huge difference. Even after this it is STILL just a hundred dollar table saw, u get waht u pay for somewhat underpowered and very noisy but it got the job done. I would recomend it for anybody who desparatly needs a table saw but only has a hundred bucks...u get a decent saw. if u can, go bigger because this wont cut it if your doing anything serious. i would definatley considrer getting a new blade, preferably a thin kerf because of the power."
1,Table Saws fence is weak,The very first time I used my table saw a clamped the fence down and the fences clamping mechanism broke. It is made of an alloy that is very weak and is not repairable with a welder.
1,Arrived unadjusted and unadjustable,"The instruction manual says ""The blade was adjusted parallel to the miter gauge slots at the factory."" Mine wasn't. One side of the blade was 1/8 inch closer to the slot than the other (not just incaccurate, but apt to cause the blade to bind and cause a dangerous accident.) I discovered why it wasn't adjusted when I proceeded to follow the instructions for adjusting it myself: the range of adjustment wasn't sufficient to correct for the misalignment. Perhaps a factory worker discovered this and decided to ship it unadjusted anyway. Needing the saw immediately, I removed the motor assembly and remounted it with 5/16"" washers serving as shims, and was then able to adjust it adequately. I wasn't expecting a precision tool at this low price, but this one wasn't even usable when I received it."
2,UNADJUSTED NOT HAPPY,"I too received the saw unaddjusted.. Ive been trying to get it straight but have failed so far. I also bought the 10inch miter saw also which was also unadjusted...Im not a professional woodworker so this kind of stuff is trying..I bought the Delta brand because I was under the impression it was a good old name.. Ive been trying to get the table saw into adjustment but it still is not parallel.. Not happy but will continue to try and get it right. I dont use it much so I dont play with it alot right now, but I plan on doing some more work in the future and hope its fixable.."
4,good quality for the money,I found this item to be of good quality considering the price was well below most table saws I examined. I used it to cut laminate flooring I was installing in my home. The saw performed flawlessly. I would highly recommmend it for the do it yourselfer but not the construction professional.
1,Sour Grapes!!,"T-slots are to small! The Shopmaster I have 3/8 x 5/8 T's. Delta's jigs do not fit! When I called their service no., I was told there was nothing I could do!"
5,Excellent Book,"This book is loaded with beautiful photos and has great commentary . A must for anyone interested in this great country. It's a great coffe table book, but I wouldn't put it near anyone's dirty clumsy hands. enjoy"
2,Stylish but off-putting,"l loved the cover so I bought the book. Mistake. It's stylish but off-putting. Nice writing but the rooms shown lean toward the cold, uninviting, and rather unreal looking. I am into decorating and style but I also want rooms my family and I can relax in. The rooms in this book definitely are not for relaxing and living in."
1,Bland and boring,"The rooms in this book are bland and boring. Very unfriendly. Very much done ""for effect"" and not for living. Design for design's sake is not necessarily good design as this book proves. Brrrrrrrrr! This book gave me the chills. I'm sorry I bought it. I just cannot identify with any of these rooms."
2,Not very useful,"This book doesn't have all that many photos, and the photos it does have do not show American homes or rooms with which people who have families and children can identify. It looks as if al these rooms are for single people who don't have a life. Very designy, very studied. interesting but impractical. I like a pared-down design aesthetic very much and live that way, but the way this person illustrates that clean approach left me a bit cold. In terms of family life, I suppose I lean more toward the clean IKEA look which emphasizes livability and comfort versus the rooms I saw in this book which look more as if they were done for show."
4,Taking your hand to the technology,"This book is a comprehensive introductory book. It takes your hand from the early beginning of pervasive technology while introducing the reader to various building blocks involved in the technology. At the end, the reader will end up knowing what's pervasive computing, what's its origin, and what are the various other technologies that serve as building blocks involved in it. The book is generic, you can start with it, then after that focus on specific use of pervasive systems. I would recommend this book for developers interested in working with type of technology and MOST IMPORTANTLY i urge new RESEARCHERS that wish to work on pervasive computing to read this book COVER TO COVER."
3,Too technical,"Dear Author,I like the general concept of your book, but it seems to technical to me.Thanks you,Kirk"
3,"good UPS, but the bells & whistles don't work for XP","the UPS for it's price/size [price](after rebate at most places)and havenig a 500VA battery made it a good deal, but the software which is supposed to gives you tons of useless information, DOESN'T WORK. I waited 16 hours for the battery to fully charge and the sofware can only tell that my UPS is connected, but nothing else, even when i pull the plug and make my PC run off of it, the software does nothing.i'm sure if i had a win9x based system i might have better results.Just remember: you get what you pay for"
4,"Long in the tooth, but still has bite!","Arguably the first definitive study of the topic, penned by the eccentric clergyman best known for writing the hymn 'Onward Christian Soldiers', this 1865 volume still beats most of the modern competition paws down. Its age means some will find it a tough read, but for others that will just enhance its charms. 'The Book of Werewolves' is still impressive scholarship today, and it was this volume that first made the careers of real-life monsters Gilles de Rais and Countess Bathory familiar to English readers (though somewhat toned down for its original Victorian audience). If you're serious about your lycanthropes, then this belongs on your shelf right beside Charlotte Otten's recent 'Lycanthropy Reader'."
3,"Good book, not a good publisher...","I like the book, but someone didn't proofread this thing. I found typos on page one! The author does an excellent job of citing sources and really demonstrates a fundamental understanding of the anthropological history of Werewolves. The book isn't for light reading. There's plenty of Greek and Latin excerpts and the language is a bit stilted. Still, if you want a good, well-rounded history of Werewolves - buy it."
3,Good Myths & Stories.... Not Exactly What I Hoped For....,"Not a bad book, but I was also after more modern versions and stories, how and why the werewolf came to be created and to be such a widespread phenom, how to kill them, how they truly live, their character, etc, etc, etc....I liked the book for what it is, but I want something more ""MEATY FACTS AND THEORY"" into the mythical beast I have come to love and envy."
1,Riddled with errors--inexcusable lack of editing,"I bought this book with high hopes of learning to hand-code html but found it to be a complete hindrance. The number of typographical errors is a crime. There are examples of design pitfalls to avoid followed by code examples that accomplish exactly what you're told not to do. The code examples have very inconsistent syntax and are very confusing for beginners. There are step by step procedures in Photoshop listing menu options in the wrong places and some that simply don't exist. If you already know the program you might be able to figure it out, but if not--you're lost. Though the companion website does list errata, the sloppiness of this book is inexcusable. On top of that, the faded colors of the text and graphics make for difficult legibility. All of this makes one wonder about the design skills of this self-professed web guru."
2,"Beautiful book design, good idea, lousy implementation","I would NOT recommend this book for beginners - books for beginners should be almost free of errors, and this one is not. File names and paths in the book don't match those on the accompanying CD, the HTML in the book doesn't match perfectly what is in the files, the referenced sites don't exist anymore. And the book site does not list the corrections. Also, for a book targeted at beginners, many engineering terms are used before they are defined. The chapters on color were particularly difficult, and I think might have been better located later in the book. The book/CD is ok for someone with a technical background who might be able to pick up on the mistakes and get past them. But generally it could have used a good quality assurance pass before it was published, verifying the exercises worked as described and the logic of the sequence of chapters. If that work had been done, then this would be a good, useful book."
2,I wasted my money,"Weinman's coasting with this effort, and so is her editor. Her earlier books are informative, but this thing is full of gratuitous self-promotion, incorrect instructions, cheap grayscale artwork, and references to non-existent demos on the CD. I screwed up by ordering this book before examining it at the bookstore. Learn from my mistake."
4,"Overall good, a few small gripes...","This book is really helpful in terms of learning HTML essentials--I keep it on my desk and use it frequently as a reference tool. Although it is a little dated by now, in terms of HTML nitty gritty, it works well.However, I found many (many!) typos in here--in the code, no less. More the editor's fault than Lynda's--this is essential to understanding how to write code--Macmillan should have caught this.And there could have been more bare bones reference sections. Other than that, ****."
3,"Great for newbies, a rehash if you have her other books.","This book will be wonderful for newbies, it gives you a lot of solid information that we professionals use. Lynda is a great teacher! If you have read some of her other books, though, it can be disappointing because she covers a *lot* of the same ground. If you are a pro, I'd say look for a book more dedicated to nuts-and-bolts of how HTML 4 differs from what we have used before."
3,Its an effective book but somehow lacks essentials needed,"I thought this was a very explanative book and all, but in some spots I was confused with the palettes and some programs like photoshop 4.0. Most of the excercises were done on this and I don't even have the program. This book entails that you always look back at what you've read. I'm looking forward to the web design with graphics book."
4,Pure Fun,"Many people have blown off this early 80s group as a silly novelty band. But I regard them as a truly talented group of musicians who created some of the most clever and infectious pop music ever recorded. Their fun, upbeat songs will bring a smile to your face and a spring in your step. The sound quality of this concert isn't quite as crisp as I would like, but considering it was recorded over 20 years ago it's not bad. I especially recommend this CD paired up with the group's ""20th Century Masters"" greatest hits studio compilation. The song ""P. Strut,"" which isn't on the ""20th Century Masters"" disc is worth the price of this CD in itself."
4,Bubblegum Rock lives on!,In an almost dead genre it is great to have a band like this for rejeuvenation. The music from this band regenerates a dying era. the tunes are upbeat and fun. The lyrics offer quick little fantasies for a generally perky and upbeat CD. This band really knows how to make you get up and dance!
5,Mars attacks!,"I haven't heard this, so forgive me for giving it five stars, but anything with Mars Williams playing saxophone on it deserves 5 stars, as he is IMHO the greatest reeds player in the known universe. He currently resides in his hometown of Chicago, where he works infrequently with his funky jazz ensemble Liquid Soul, tours regularly with the Psychedelic Furs, does many avant garde / improvised music projects with the top players in the field, and plays a weekly gig with a great quartet, the Extraordinary Popular Delusions, at a local club. He just tore up the stage at the Chicago Jazz Festival last Saturday (9/4/10) with a quintet led by pianist Paul Giallorenzo. By all means buy this, and check out the (one) Waitresses vid (I Know What Boys Like) on YouTube!"
1,Pop Secret Popcorn,"We eat a lot of popcorn - practically every night. We always eat the Pop Secret ""Homestyle"". The one time I ordered it online I ordered the small snack size bags because we couldn't find them at the grocery store. It was too stale to eat. Won't do that again."
4,Johnny Van Zant - 'King Biscuit Flower Hour' (King Biscuit),"Another worthy archive live performance from the King Biscuit vaults.I'm sure that all of you most likely know that Johnny is currently the lead vocalist for the revamped Lynyrd Skynyrd.This 'King Biscuit' gig was recorded at a show in Jacksonville,Florida in June,1985.Apparently in the '80's,Van Zant had a decent solo career where he'd put out something like four,maybe five good southern rock lp's.Notable cuts here include ""Two Plus Two"",""No More Dirty Deals"",""I'm A Fighter"" and ""In Your Eyes"".Worth checking out for yourself."
1,Seriously messed up,"If you are into rape, torture and the mentally imbalanced (both hero and villain in this case) you may actually like this book. If you have an iota of self respect, don't make the mistake I did and buy this book."
4,Pretty Good Stuff,"This is the third Laymon book I have read, following The Traveling Vampire Show and Island. I haven't been disappointed yet. All three have been entertaining reads, and I have had a hard time putting them down. I think No Sanctuary might be the most explicit out of the three. It has lots of sex, and lots of gore (What else do you expect from Laymon!?). My only complaint is about the character Angus. The parts of the story involving him didn't seem like they really belonged in this story. It seems he may have been ""duct-taped"" in to add to the length of the book. I would still recommend the book to any Laymon fan, and to any fan of cheesy horror."
3,No Sanctuary,"Richard Laymon's ""No Sanctuary"" isn't one of his best works.In my opinion not much happened. Reading the book actually became a chore for me because of this and I couldn't wait to get finished with it.I'd recommend reading something else by him and giving this one a pass, unless you are desparate!"
3,Lost in the wilderness,"The plot in a nutshell: Rick and Bert go camping in the wilderness. Bad things happen (eventually). Gillian breaks into someone's home and vacations there while the owner is away. Bad things happen (eventually). The two stories come crashing together rather suddenly (as we, of course, have by then figured out they must). The end.Don't get me wrong, this book was basically well-written and was pretty much a page-turner throughout, but it's not one that is going to stay with me for very long. The characters had little depth or motivation for their actions, the ending was just too neat and tied up, and the book was just too slick. I thought it worth reading, but not really a keeper."
2,Don't Give Up On Laymon,"If you plan on making this your first Laymon book...DON'T! Start off with something better like The Cellar, Beast House, Endless Night, Island...basically, anything else he wrote! He's not for everyone, but if you like to read for fun and you're a slasher movie fan, then give him a try...don't get me wrong, he can write...it's just that No Sanctuary wasn't his best..wish he was still around to write more..."
2,"Sorry, I couldn't finish it...","I thought I would really like this book. It started out really intriguing. Scary, in fact. A girl in bed, alone...the sound of breaking glass...an intruder in the house...and so it began. I've read Stephen King for years, Koontz too. I had never read Laymon before. This, my first one, lost me about half way through. I'd have to say this story turns out more like a campy '70's scary movie...where you hear yourself screaming, ""Don't go in there, that's where the killer is!"" It just became awful. I began to hate the characters, not caring anymore if they were indeed murdered. ""If you're too stupid to get OUT of the woods, you deserve to die!"" and so, at page 287, I gave up.I haven't attempted to read any others by him, although the Traveling Vampire show looks interesting."
3,Meh.,"I usually like Laymons' books but this was a tad boring for me. There's two stories that alternate in the book. The stories drag on, and on, and just as soon as they get somewhere good it's basically the end. Twas good enough to keep me interested to read it, but definitely not one of his better works."
3,"Good Book, Not that great","Usually I stick with fiction romance, but thought I'd take a chance with Laymon's ""No Sancutary"". I have read Dean Koontz in the past and enjoyed his work so thought Laymon would be just as good (since Koontz recommends him). I'm not saying the story line was horrible, I'm simply saying that this book was not scary nor suspenseful (except maybe the last 20 pages). I feel like the majority of the book was leading up to something that never came. I feel like Laymon took his time getting to the climax and than rushed through the ending leaving me disappointed.Yesterday I started reading ""Don't Tell"" by Karen Rose and after only 15 pages, her book proves more terryifying and suspeneful than Laymons claims to be. I would like to try another of Laymon's book in the futre. I've heard ""No Sanctuary"" was not his best work."
2,no sanctuary = no good,"I work in a bookstore and I noticed a lady buying a bunch of Richard Laymon books so I thought, hmmm, there must be something to this guy. So I bought this book and read it on my day off. It took me about 4 hours to read the whole book, which to some people means it was a good book. I guess you could say it was suspensful, but I didn't think it was scary at all. And when I finished the book, I had no sense of accomplishment. I was left with a sense of disappointment instead, like I just wasted four hours of my day off. But I am not going to quit Richard Laymon because of a bad first impression, I am going to keep trying. There has got to be something to an author that sells particularly well for our store."
1,Terrible,"Looking at pictures of Richard Laymon you get the idea that he wasn't popular with girls. This shows in his characters voyeurism and their rape fantasies (and this from the supposedly good guys) that they constantly indulge in. Most lead female characters in his novels inevitably end up been raped and beaten. There is no suspense in the novels at all, just characters that you actually hope will get killed just so that their inane thoughts and deeds will come to an end.He recycles the same few stories over and over again just changing the characters names (exactly the same as his good friend Dean Koontz). His stories are basically just more perverted versions of Koontz's.I really enjoy violent novels (like Michael Slade, Rex Miller, T Winter-Damon etc) but Laymon books are just puerile trash."
4,Great HDTV and great value too!,"I have my Xbox 360 connected to this Tv, and it's just awesome. My 360's component cables can do up to 1080i! Which is good for the price tag. My only complaint is the amount of inputs. Only one component, one hdmi, and two composite with s-video. A couple more component couldn't hurt..."
5,Not just for camping...,"I enjoy reading an interesting cookbook, and Spicy Camp Cooking is filled with great recipes, information on menu planning, spices, cooking tips for camping, and a variety of foods to prepare. From appetizers, salads, stir fry, grilled meals, and desserts, this book has it all. O'Keefe knows that the culinary arts and a taste for spicier foods has been lacking in the outdoor recreation area. That void has been filled with his book. If you like to try new recipes with a gourmet flair, but with a minimum of both time and ingredients, take a look at his book. Spicy roasted potatoes, spicy chicken stir fry, and sour cream french apple cobbler are just a few of the delights that await you when you open this book. Of course, limiting yourself to using this book while camping would be a waste of great food. These can all be made in your own comfortable kitchen. Bon appetit!"
4,Good Machine for the Money,This machine does what a midi lathe should. Fit and finsh is very nice along with the ease of operation. The only down side is the plastic door and latch system does not align up nor secure well. However this does not affect the operation of the machine just gives a cheaper feel. I'm sure it save Delta fifty cents.
1,Way disappointed,"Saw the engineering original of this lathe at a show before initial production units were available. Looked very impressive. Bought one as soon as available. Very disappointed. Made in China and showed it. Drive and center points didn't line up, bearings ground loudly, the tailstock locking handle and belt cover were plastic. Both headstock and tailstock handwheels wobbled which created vibration when running, even after trying to align and tighten them better. I checked a number of other Delta's on display at three different retail stores in my area. All showed the same problems. I returned the Delta and bought a Jet. Wonderful machine in comparison."
3,They are okay,These shoes are great beach shoes!! But if you wear them alot they will break! They are extremely comfortable! But as i said before they break easily! I had them for a month or two and i went to the beach every day for an hour or two almost and they broke.
5,Fantastic,"Emile Henry bakeware is fantastic and I use it for lots of stuff, not just lasagna. I ordered this dish as a replacement for one I had for years but I accidentally broke it. I was so upset when I broke it I ordered this one right then and it came just two days later! Cleans so easily and looks new after years of use! No kitchen is complete without this dish!"
4,almost a perfect trick,"This is a superb trick that will definitely amaze anyone not familiar with it. The effect is that someone chooses one of 3 colors from 3 cards. Then the chosen color disappears from one card and seems to ""magically"" appear on a blank card. Being somewhat experienced with magic tricks I was able to work out an effective way of doing this trick. It's self working but you need to work out the best way of forcing a color and executing the effect. It might take some time to learn to do it right (15-30 minutes or more if you're inexperienced). This is a very strong visual effect and is definitely worth taking the time to do it right. The downside is that you can't pass the cards out or you'll reveal the secret. Also you can't repeat the trick (which you should not do for most tricks anyway)."
4,Works Great,They shipped fast and it work's great with my lap top and was a replacement for the same product that just got old and wore out.
2,did not work,I got my refund for this and I said thanks. It not even listed in Targus website so was unable to get it fixed
4,"Worked great, lasted 3 years","I bought this mouse at WalMart. I used it heavily for 2 to 2-1/2 years, it was stored for about six months during the total 3 year life span (quit working today--new batteries, plug & unplug, press reset buttons--it is dead). The tracking was accurate, I liked the feel of the material they covered it with, and it worked well for all I did with it (web browsing, basic computer tasks). The only real design flaw is that the included cord can only charge the battery; you need a second USB port for the receiver, even if the cord is connected to your computer. The last few months I would occasionally have to pop the receiver out and back in when I started up my laptop or it wouldn't recognize movement. Targus was generous with what's included; in addition to the mouse and USB receiver, you get a charging cable, mini USB extension cable, two pretty good rechargeable AAA's, and carry bag. This is a decent mouse, and I am happy with the purchase."
2,Previous positive review now a NEGATIVE!!!,"I'm re-editing my previous review. I initially gave it 4 stars because at first I was pleased with the mouse but wasn't sure on the battery life. I'm on my 2nd Targus mouse and it SUCKS! Never buying this again. The battery life is terrible and about a week after I used it wirelessly - it never worked again without being connected to the USB cord. It's not like I used this mouse everyday either - I took good care of it, kept it in the pouch it came with and it just never worked as well as it did after the first week. I've tried re-charging etc but this product is not worth buying. If I knew then what I know now, I would have saved the money and just bought a Mac mouse. You'll have a worthless mouse after a couple of uses and although it is very easy to use, it becomes less of a useful accessory and more of an annoyance. I would never ever buy this mouse again."
5,Great Mouse,This mouse works great on any surface and comes with a usb charging cable that allows it to be charged while it is used. The Battery low indicator is not very visible because it is located in the wheel of the mouse and i usually find out the battery has run out once the mouse stops working.
1,Broke the first day,"When I first handled the mouse I was delighted with the texture and the way it fit my hand. Also, when I first plugged it in, it started working immediatly. However, although I left it plugged in for 4+ hours, it no longer worked and had the symptoms of dead batteries. Also, unlike advertised, the mouse would not work when plugged into the USB.BTW- the owner's manual posted on the Targus web site is different from the one that comes with it. The one that comes with it says to charge for 4 hours, while the one on-line says 8.Tech support next to useless. Kept telling me that I should take it back to the store, while I kept telling him that the store (CompUSA) was going out of business and I could not take it back.Currently waiting for feedback from Targus to see what I can do with this piece of junk."
2,This product seems good at first but...,"At first, when i brought this item at staples and brought it home, it was phenominal. But then, not a few months later...it broke...that's not great quality. If it didn't break i would of loved it, hwo it had rechargbale usb cable etc, ti was great. So if u don't care if your mouse is going to break in a few months go ahead, buy it."
2,Short battery life,"Nice mouse, but I can only get about 2 hours between charges, so it has to be connected about half the time. You might as well have a wired mouse. Save your money."
3,Doesn't work quite as it should,"This mouse's fit in my hand is great, as is its anti-slip texture. It's also very sensitive and reliable, with perfect tracking. However... there seems to be some problem with my unit. Every so often its rechargeable batteries simply quit -- and it's not due to discharging, because I am now testing it plugged into USB. The problem seems to be a faulty contact. If I don't use the unit for a while (let's say, go have a meal while leaving the computer on), when I return the mouse will be dead. I have to open the battery compartment and jiggle the batteries a bit. Then, when I close the battery compartment the mouse will work just fine. Until the next time I step away from the computer... I'm not really happy with this, as you can understand. By the way, this mouse will NOT work plugged only to USB: when charging the battery, you have to occupy two USB ports so that the mouse can function and recharge."
2,Same problems,"I had the same problems as ubat. it would just quit working after leaving it plugged in, not in use for awhile. I would have to reconnect the USB key in order to get it to work again. Not sure if its suppose to be like that to save power but I doubt it because the batteries dont stay charged very long anyways. I was mostly using the mouse plugged into the cable which completely defeated the purpose of a wireless mouse. It does look and feel great but I would not recommend buying it."
2,Too difficult,"I am actually an adult who tried to learn basic knitting from this kit (rationalizing that, since it was for kids, it would be easier) and found it useless. I ended up checking ""Knitting for Dummies"" and going to http://www.knittinghelp.com/ for videos on the basic techniques, and found these sources a lot more helpful.This sparse kit has somewhat useless, small plastic needles and vague instructions on the basics, accompanied by project cards that are laughably advanced for a brand-new knitter. Since this kit is ostensibly for children, it should have scaled way back to clearer instructions and illustrations and simpler projects. Perhaps some extremely bright kids who already had sewing experience might be able to make something out of it, but I would be really surprised."
2,Good Songs...but She Ruins Them,"I really like the idea of this album. I've never seen Debbie Gravitte live, so maybe I'm missing something. But on this recording she overembellishes every song with vocal tics and catches that make the songs unlistenable. I feel as if she's beating me over the head and saying, ""I'm a great singer, and you'd better like me."" No thanks."
2,Not as great as these reviews say...,"Specifically what bothers me about his album is an overall lack of rhythm within each song (""Junk Man"" and ""Monotony"" excluded). Ms. Gravitte seems to always be wallowing in the production of her sound and is unable to drive the music forward - she sounds to be minutely behind the beat almost all the time. This makes the ballads drag, and the up tempos lose their excitement. The lady's got a good voice, no doubt about it, but she overuses the ""cry"" attack on too many notes, and she doesn't really sing with much color - every song is kind of sung in the same way no matter what the emotional content is. If you like a real Broadway belter you will enjoy this album, but perhaps it is best listened to in small doses."
1,Did I listen to the same album as the other reviewers?,"My husband bought this album based on the Amazon reviews. I couldn't disagree more with them. She has a nice voice and parts of every song sound good but not one song on the album was good all the way through. This is a great collection of songs but some really bad arrangements. I suspect the arrangements may be attempts to adjust the songs to accomodate a singer who's vocal range is too limited for these great numbers. I expected some great belting based on the song list but got mostly shouting instead. Her diction is very good, but she seems to hold on to consonants too long which sounds harsh. Some parts of the album (especially the trio she sings with herself) were actually painful to listen to. I would give a 1 star rating to less than 1% of the CDs we own; this is one of them."
2,The emperor in naked.,"I can't believe how complimentary the reviews on here are for these poems. Ugh. When I read them, I want to tear every last hair out of my skull."
3,"Loved it but the zippers broke, due to design...less than 5mo.","Space is fine, compartments and all that everyone said that is good about it is true. But the zipper design on the main compartment on the back is bad. I think too much stress goes into the actual zipper when you pull the back open...thus making the zippers not work after only a few months of light use. I am assuming no one else wrote this because they wrote their reviews after only a few uses. Love the design but needs a better zipper. We'll see if the warranty holds true!"
3,Initially loved but now falling apart,"I thought I'd finally found the PERFECT diaper bag, but after a couple months of use, the seams started ripping out. It is ok if you always wear on both shoulders, but the seams will rip if you just carry it with one strap."
4,Great for baby on the go,"I ordered a backpack style diaper bag b/c my girlfriend recommended this versus an over the shoulder bag. She was right. This is great for keeping your hands free and I can use it with my Snugli. I really like the small straps that allow you to hang it on the back of a stroller. My only ""complaint"" is the inside big section does not have a divider or compartment. I would have liked a section just for diapers so I don't have to dig around for them. Otherwise, this is a great product so far (my baby is 8 weeks old now)."
4,A Real Review,"This product apparently has a PR company writing it's product reviews. I believe that the four previous reviews are part of their campaign. However, my husband and I think this is the most practical of all the diaper bags we could find at Babies R Us and plan to buy one when it becomes available. All of the information about the product in the previous reviews are correct as far as we can tell. I think the little fake spelling mistakes are pretty funny! I didn't give it 5 stars because it's very ugly and only comes in one color scheme. It doesn't matter to us because after a few months all bags start to look dingy and grey."
3,already ripped,"Although it took some getting used to, we liked this bag after we found out the best way to organize it for us. The only problem is that after only 6 months of use the bag ripped along one of the seams and now the fabric is fraying. This bag was not cheap, and I expected better quality from Columbia. To get it replaced I have to pay to mail it to the company, and at their ""sole discretion"" they will either repair it, replace it, or send us something ""of comparable style and color"". hmmmm....not what I'd call good customer service :("
2,"It's ok, for seven months then a seam rippped, hole in the bottom.","Bought this bag 7 months ago when my daughter started pre-school. Took her to school by bus,used the bag everyday. Stuffed it with her lunch,and clothes. The seams on bottom of the bag have ripped and seams on the top of the bag have frayed. For the price I expected a much longer life expectancy. Disappointed with the product."
1,"great concept, poor quality","We bought this diaper bag with the idea that a backpack would be great option for us. It's not one shouldered and we can have both hands free. That being said, we use this as our everyday diaper bag. After only 4 months of use it is falling apart. the mesh on the outside is all coming apart and the place inside that holds diapers has ripped apart. The straps are all fraying also. This is very disappointing being how expensive it was and you would think a name like Columbia would sell good quality items. There clothing has always been wonderful but this bag fell short."
3,Way overpriced here,I can NOT figure out why this is listed at this price when I purchased it at Babys R Us for I think $39.99. For this exact same one. The other colored backpack was within a few dollars of that. I would NOT recommend buying this online.
3,size of bag,I am considering ordering this bag and I can not get a response as to the overall dimensions of this bag. Does anyone out there know? Thanks for your reviews.
4,fine musical penned by Noel Coward,"ACE OF CLUBS is a relatively-obscure 1950 offering from Noel Coward, which ran for a decent 211 performances. The cast includes Pat Kirkwood (WONDERFUL TOWN, CHRYSANTHEMUM), as well as Graham Payn, Sylvia Cecil and Peter Tuddenham, and the ensemble cast includes a few who would become big stars in the future (Jean Carson, June Whitfield and Susan Swinford). The score is average (this is surprising considering that Coward was no slouch in the melody department), though delights include ""Nothing Can Last Forever"", ""I'd Never, Never Know"", ""My Kind of Man"", ""Chase Me, Charlie"" and ""Why Does Love Get in the Way?"". Coward also has a number about Napoleon's ""Josephine"" which pre-dates Cole Porter's SILK STOCKINGS ""Josephine"" number by about 5 years! ACE OF CLUBS is a good (but not essential) addition to your cast album collection."
5,low carb mocha mix,"The product makes a delicious blended mocha.Received product a few days after order.Somewhat expensive, but worth it."
5,I love it,"Oh my God,,,,this is the most amazing low carb drink I ever had. I love it. I tastes like S******* cold coffee...I will certainly order agin"
1,Low Budget Stinker,"This movie takes the title for worst horror movie I have ever seen! The background audio is just atrocious and renders the film almost unwatchable by drowning out the actors and does absolutely nothing to enhance the viewing experience(just think the sound of Freddie Kruegers knife fingers amplified by 100 playing through a feedbacking marshall stack!)The acting is horrible but that is to be expected of a low budget indy production. The plot is never developed and the movie quickly descends into random images that make no sense.The pics on the back of the box are not even in the movie!! I have seen many low buget productions that overcame the lack of financial resources to deliver a decent cinematic product. Unfortunately this low budget ""movie"" is a real STINKER and a waste of time and money. STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS CINEMATIC DISASTER!"
1,Season in Hell : Evil Farmhouse Torture,Season In Hell: Evil Farmhouse TortureThis movie by far was the WORSE movie of any kind that i ever watched . In plain words this (HORROR) movie SUCKED BIG TIME - it was a hugh waist of money. I watched about 15 mins. & could not believe that anyone would attempt to make this CRAP .I FF through the rest of the flick hoping it might get better - BUT NO LUCK. At that point i removed the CD from my CD player & put it in my trash can & out it went . That will be the very last time that i purchase a movie based on your customers reviews. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.I had to rate this item in order for it to send SO just disregard the one star. The movie SUCKS
2,OK,"This is ""needle drop"" taken off 45 rpms that were not state of the art to start. Noise and distortion obscure musicality and sound is thin. Performances are fine for deliberate imitation, which is not always a bad thing. Lo Fi at your own risk."
2,Who is the Author?,"I disliked the writing style which is shallow, sound-bity and blog like. I can get that kind of writing anywhere on the Internet for free. Another strange thing is there are no author names on the articles. Authorship is very important. It is what gives words credibility vs your average noise. All in all I was excited to receive the first issue but after 15-20 pages I had to force myself to continue reading. Most of the articles were just breaking news camouflaging as analysis. I am fine with both but which is which? If you want to provide analysis it is not enough to just outline state on affairs on a chosen topic. Such material is (broadly speaking) lifted straight from bazillion of other media sources and Internet. You have to go further and actually develop some non trivial new information. That is analysis."
5,opinion of The Economist,"Arguably the best economic and political journal in the world today, enabling citizens to make intelligent choices in everyday decision-making. Every article is a great read, and often full of marvelously understated British humour."
1,"Excellent publication, theiving fulfillment organization","The publication itself is excellent - a different perspective from that of Time, Newsweek, and others on US and world events and trends and superb analysis and insight.But for the third time in five years, the subscription organization has terminated my subscription for no reason or taken my renewal money and failed to renew my subscription. My inquiries result in an automated email response, but no action. This is nothing short of theft, and there is clearly a pattern of this behavior."
5,For the thinking man,"I'm not going to pretend that I agree with every word I read in this publication, but even on topics that I am skeptical of, a very good case is made. One thing everyone should strive for is to get a better understanding of the world around them, and there really is no better place to turn for that understanding than the pages of The Economist. Everyone should subscribe."
2,It takes a month to get a magazine sent on a subscription?,"Really? In this day and age? Completely unacceptable -and now after dropping $200+, I have to go and hunt down the Christmas issue (when I ordered it right after Thanksgiving)? These advocates of free market efficiency need a long look in the mirror.But it's an essential read. Not every week, since they do tend to coast a fair bit these days, but some special supplement or other is going to more than pay for the year's sub. I save the old ones to give away -how many mags can you say that about?"
4,Best coverage in a weekly,"The Economist has for decades been a free-market, classical liberal magazine, but has recently under her new editor gotten squishy on all sorts of interventionist government backstop twaddle.Still,the depth and breadth of coverage is amazing and shames any American newsweekly.Recently The Economist has beefed up its coverage of Asia (perhaps in response to the death of Far East Economic Review and being able to pick up stringers cheap).Folks complain of the stiff cover and subscription price, making it a premium or expense account class item. For me it is worth it: Advertising doesn't pay the bills here.One of the few news magazines that covers the middle east dispassionately and well.One of the few magazines that actually uses economics and statistics and finance terms well. The editors clearly know and understand what it is they are writing about."
1,"Great magazine, crap autorenewal system","Have been a regular subscriber for about two years now, and while I agree it's the best current affairs magazine going, their computerized autorenewal system is crap - every three months I have to chase them up by email, get the same rubbish back about checking with my bank or credit card company, then having missed a couple of editions, they finally, grudgingly and rather accusingly reinstate my subscription. Don't know what to advise, but just avod this method of paying for it!"
3,No Response to Question,"My order of the Economist was renewal of a gift subscription, due to begin in January 2010. Your solicitation in late September 2009 assured me that the renewal would be treated as such, i.e. beginning in January 2010 when the original subscription expired. You can imagine my concern when I received a confirming e-mail from you, saying that the subscription would begin in 4 to 6 weeks! I immediately replied expressing my concern, but have never received a reply from Amazon. I'd now appreciate confirmation that the renewal gift subscription will be handled as you originally promised. R. F. Garland"
3,Can you send to be faster?,"I bought it on August, but it still not send to me. Can you send me soon and I have homework about it!"
1,"It will make you feel sophisticated, but The Economist is dripping with bias","This review is more of a warning. You will probably very much enjoy The Economist as it will no doubt convince you that you are sophisticated. Do not fall for it! You are just reading a magazine about sophisticated people.As it turns out, The Economist is plagued by the same thing plaguing journalism in general. Writers need to write a certain number of articles per year. Each article needs to include a certain number of words. Thus the truth is altered in order to have enough stories and to make each story fill enough space. If you passively read this magazine and many others you are letting yourself be hypnotized into believing a skewed version of reality. If you are reading this magazine with your guard up, retaining your skeptical/analytical mind, then why bother reading it at all?Let your ego go. You can still feel sophisticated without reading what's really just a tabloid with big words.Thank you for your time!"
2,Going downhill,"I have been a subscriber to the economist for over 15 years. For the past few years or so I have noticed that the quality of news coverage and analysis has gone downhill. Many subjects are now handled with a kind of facile politically correct treatment that can be had elsewhere at a lower price (or free on the Internet).There is more breezy opinion and less presentation of potentially conflicting or subtle facts with evenhanded analysis. Certain topics (Israel, President Bush, Global Warming) guarantee a knee-jerk emission of drivel.Before subscribing read the Economist at a local library for a while - see if it appeals to you first."
4,Why isn't this available on Kindle?,"There doesn't seem to be a link to request magazines be made available for Kindle. There are very few magazines available on Kindle at the moment. I would very much like to see The Economist and NewScientist magazines on the Kindle. So far, there doesn't seem to be a way to request that from Amazon other than this review form which doesn't really seem to be an appropriate place for such a request."
1,Order elsewhere,"I love the Economist, but I wouldn't recommend ordering it from Amazon. You either won't get it or you'll get it one, two, perhaps even three, weeks late."
5,King of the weekly news magazines,"The Economist is truly the best of the weekly global news magazines. Too bad it's not American so I don't have to bother with the pesky differences in spelling! Don't let the magazine's name mislead you into thinking it is mostly about business, financial, or economic matters; The Economist covers important news in virtually every country, including articles on science, technology, books, art, and people, and it offers at least two in-depth reports every issue. The writing is clear, insightful, and aimed at an intelligent, informed audience, with a sprinkling of dry British humor (always in good taste). Yes, The Economist has a bias - a free-market bias - but they wear their heart lightly on their sleeve, so I can live with it. If you want to stay informed about the world, if you can read only one news magazine, then The Economist is the one."
2,Do not get subscriptions from amazon,"Last year , I purchased a years subscription for my son for the economist. When he moved I notified amazon about his change of address. Was informed that it takes 6-8 weeks to change the address on a weekly magazine . I then tried to renew the subscription for another year. Technically this would be December of 2013. However when my son finally got the economist ,the label says the subscription ends in August. Now he will have missed out on 8 weeks of the magazine plus he will have lost 3 more months of his renewal. I would recommend getting subscription from another magazine dealer"
5,Excellent Source Material,My whole family enjoys reading The Economist in order to keep up with world news. We especially like the format--each article is completed before a new one begins. No turning to pages in the back of the magazine.
3,Quality degrading,"Used to be a great magazine. However, I found the quality is degrading over time now. Not too much investigative article that provide anything new from what you have read anywhere else. It serves now more like a weekly digest than anything else."
5,News not bias,I have been a subscriber to the Economist for over a decade off and on as finances and time allowed. I have found that the news is presented in enough detail that I can detect the facts and appreciate the writers perspective even when they are wrong. :)
3,Don't plan on playing home movies!,"I purchased this DVD player to replace an older model after it appeared in my Gold Box.As far as a DVD player goes I have no complaint. It loads DVDs fairly quickly. The image quality is acceptable (I don't own a HDTV). The remote is constantly lit and layed out in a logical manner.CON: It doesn't play VCDs!! This is why it only gets 3 stars I would return this model if it didn't take me so long to figure this out. If you make your own movies (by using a digital camcorder, etc) don't expect to be able to enjoy them with this POS. I can't believe that any modern DVD player would omit this feature.I really like this DVD player, it's too bad I can't recommend it."
1,It Does Not Work!,"I purchased the Zenith DVB216 ... The image it provides is unstable. The image ocilates slowly from perfect to fuzzy color to black and white and back. The cycle is irregular. Sometimes the picture is perfect for as much as 6 minutes before running through the cycle. The worst part of the experience is dealing with Zenith's customer representatives. I called them immediately on discovering that the DVD was not working properly. They suggested trying a variety of things which I attempted. No change. My wife and I have called Zenith 5 times. We have repeatedly been lied to. We have never been able to locate the same service representative twice. Each service representative has promised us a variety of things, a new DVD is on the way, etc. At this writing I am almost 2 months into the process of obtaining a working DVD from Zenith. At this rate the technology will be obsolete before we obtain a working sample of this wonderful device. ..."
2,Excellent Picture but....,"The Zenith DVD216 has an excellent picture and the unit is atractive, but the remote is useless. On any input from the remote, there is a very, very slow response from the DVD. It takes forever to select a particular scene. I am sending back the unit for a replacement. It may be that this unit had a defective remote or a defective sensor eye on the DVD. Amazon is sending me a new unit. I will follow-up when the new unit arrives. Zenith Electronics Incorporated is useless. They do not have anyone on tech-support. Customer service at Zenith did not help either. They wanted me to fax them a copy of the bill, and then they would let me know what to do. Their fax machine was busy all day. Amazon was terrific. They are sending a new unit out today. It will arrive in 3 or 4 days. The defective unit will be picked up and shipped back for free."
1,Broken in less than 6 months - Bad Warranty,"The player stopped reading disks less than 6 months after purchase. Since the warranty doesn't cover labor, it can't be fixed without paying twice what it would cost to buy a new one."
1,Bad experience,"After shopping for a progressive scan player, I decided to upgrade my Panasonic to the Zenith DVB216. My hardware inlcudes a Philips 50"" HDTV and Pioneer receiver. I might have received a defective player because I swear my old player outdid this player in terms of resolution and clarity. The output wasn't that impressive and the sound wasn't that great either (I used the optical output for both players). Appearance wise, I don't really care much of, but I notice the remote looks really cheap and the buttons on the unit are way too small (reminds me of my Dad's old 80's style stereo component buttons), ergonomics is non-existent. I returned the item and went back to my old one for now. Next time I'm picking up a Pioneer progressive scan, even though it costs a little more. You do get what you pay for when it comes to electronics..."
1,was good when it worked,"Like many of the other reviewers, my unit stopped working after approximately 6 months, with the same ""no disc"" error. Avoid this lemon."
1,Good... for awhile,I've had this DVD player for quite some time... but just recently it decided to stop reading DVDs. It still reads CDs but what's the point of having a DVD player that won't read DVDs?
1,From the beginning,"I've given up and replaced this machine with a cheap Memorex which works just fine. From the beginning this machine has given me problems that I don't have with the $30 Koss I bought at Sears. DVD's freeze continually and there seemed to be no remedy for this problem. Finally, the machine stopped working altogether. I've had it since 2/2003 and will just pitch it I guess. What else can I do with it? This machine was highly rated by CR. What were they thinking?"
1,A Gamer,This game stinks! It is hard to figure out and it is the stupidest game boy color game I have EVER played! Dont make the misstake I made and waste your money on this dumb pointless game. I would give this game negative stars if I could! I turned it off no more then 10 minutes after I started playing it. Take my advice and DONT buy it! If you still dont believe me RENT it PLEASE before you waste your money buying it.
1,Wouldn't read this if it were assigned or not,"I had to read this book for an anthropology class of mine, and it only created more questions than answers. It wasn't a fun read, but it wasn't informative either. Angrosino's definitions are vague and his assertion that anything can be a religion nullifies the need for him to continue the rest of the book. If you are a professor reading this and thinking of assigning this book, please thing twice. We were supposed to use this book to create dialogue as my class is a strictly discussion course, and mostly we could only talk about how much we didn't like the book. Angrosino's final chapter also includes a case study written by him and only goes to show how untalented he is at writing or expressing any knowledge of the ""sacred."" His case study also features grammatical errors which lower his credibility from very little to none. That's a big problem when this is being used in an academic setting."
2,Superficial regurgitation of the author's prejudices,"A real disappointment. The author makes some good points about the commercialization of sport, but there's nothing substantive here that hasn't been said better elsewhere, without all the glib generalizations."
3,For Yankee haters only,"Chadwin hates the Yankees (as do I) but his book tends to wander all over the place. He can't seem to decide if the Yankees are evil, all of baseball is evil, or if it's just Rudy Giuliani's fault.He seems to like baseball, but it's hard to tell. He also hasn't noticed that you can find homophobic, racist fans in New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, or any other major league city. That's just the nature of many sports fans."
3,A Slight Disappointment,"This is not a bad album but if you want to own just one live Pat Travers disc then you should skip this and buy ""Go For What You Know."" The King Biscuit album was recorded after the departure of lead guitarist, Pat Thrall, and his scorching leads are missed."
1,Wrong book was purchased and was sent back to sender for refund - refund not yet received,I returned the book back to sender. I was intending to purchase Informatica - computer related book not what was sent. I need for the seller to refund my money back. I've not receive a refund yet.
1,Informatica 1.0 Book & CD-ROM,"I paid for the price of book and CD- ROM, but there's no CD-ROMin the shipment. ???"
2,Grandpa,"Since the bolts & predilled holes did not match. I was forced to go to a number of hardware stores to purchase relacements, while two of the first two bolts I could only force part way in & would not come out.Did not have time to wait upon new parts!Bummer!!"
5,Great table,This table and chair set is fairly easy to put together and is very sturdy. I especially like the storage containers underneath. I was very pleased with the quality and the price was amazing compared to other sites.
1,Don't order if you want it anytime soon ...,"I can't tell you if this is a good product or not because, like the last reviewer said, it takes forever to ship the darn thing! I ordered it in early April ... it is now mid June and I still don't have my table!"
3,Assembly was a pain,"The table and chairs are very sturdy, but I had a lot of difficulty putting them together. The 10 dowels that connect the legboards of the table have holes in the end that are barely wide enough to accomodate the screws. I was able to locate a second Allen wrench, set one screw on either end, and then turn both wrenches clockwise to obtain enough leverage to sink the screws in. However, it was exhausting work and was hard on my hands because of the force required. It took about three evenings, spending 30 minutes each evening, to get it ready. Now that it's assembled, by 2-year-old son loves to sit at the table and eat or play with his cars on the durable top surface."
4,So cute...but you need a bit of muscle to put together,"This table was totally worth being sore today after putting together the table yesterday. It is so cute and the table and chairs are really sturdy once you put them together. I'm not weak, but wow, it took some grit to screw in some of the nails into the 10 wooden rods that hold the bins. I literally got out a pot holder because my hands were hurting. The instructions though are easy to follow. It took me about an hour and half to put it all together while I was watching t.v. It's sooooooo cute though and my son was so excited to see it this morning. Not sure if it will hold up, but it seems like it will. I'll update if it doesn't for some reason."
1,Don't bother,"I have no idea what people are raving about here regarding this table.This is NOT easy to put together. There are like 40 screws and a lot that have to fit into sleeves. If you don't line up screw and sleeve exactly, you'll strip the sleeve and then waste a lot of time. For the table, get a power drill or your arm will fall off. The table top attaches with this cheesy four-screw system, 3 of which broke easily (no, no power drill on those, just a screw driver).Very frustrating to assemble, too much hardware and many pieces. It's kid's table not a computer station for five people for crying out loud!"
1,I already HATE this table!!,"I've used more cuss words in the last half hour than the last 10 years of my life. Assembly is RIDICULOUS!! I excel in spacial relations, so it's not a matter of not understanding the pieces. It's that the 10 poles that hold the table together (10 poles = 20 screws, by the way) do not have the holes lined up properly and you have to hold the pole on one side with one hand and try to use the other hand to try to turn the wrench and get the screw to go in, meanwhile making sure the pole doesn't turn and that you are holding the table wall straight. AWFUL design!! The first pole is stuck and I can get it on or off. So, now we don't have a table. I definitely DON'T recommend this product."
3,Sturdy table...not so sturdy bins,The tables and the chairs were sturdy... a little painful to put together.... the plastic bins are not sturdy and its one piece sliding into the other to form a bin and it just doesn't always stay in place.... minus one star for the poor plastic bins....and minus another start as I didn't receive the extra foot that goes on to the sides (it only had the screws to fit them).
2,Tipsy table,"I bought this last year for [...]. I thought the bins would be helpful but they are not. What is means is that there is no room for legs so your child can only sit on the short ends of the table when what my daughter really wants to do is spread out her crayons etc on the long end. If she puts too much weight on the short end of the table, the only place where she can sit becasue the bins are in the way, the table will tip because the rectangle shape sets it off balance. Plus, you can't really fit as much as you might think in small bins angled in this way. In the end we scored a hand-me-down table from a friends which my 3 year-old uses for her art projects and she got a doll house for Xmas this year which now sits on top of this kidkraft table. Kind of a bummer to use a [...] table as a doll house stand when you can pick up a table at Ikea for [...]. This set is attractive but not very practical, especially for the price."
5,Great kid furniture,"Well made, easy construction, great for kids. My son and his friends love doing projects on this table."
2,Okay except....,"It looks very cute, but the screws did not fit in about half of the dowels. The wood is nice, overhang sides Re a good touch, I'm just not sure how long it will last with improper fits."
3,Difficult to assemble,"My husband is a whiz at putting things together, but he had a lot of difficulty with this set because the holes did not line up. Otherwise, once together, it is very sturdy and a nice set."
5,Just what I was looking for,This is a sturdy set. We received it about a month ago. My 2-yr son has been playing with it instead of using it. The size of the table and chairs was reasonable.
2,The Inspiration for Spinal Tap,"This recording comes across as being pompous, overblown arena rock. The playing is sloppy and the singer seems drunk or high, inserting expletives in his dialog for shock value. I had the original LP of Uriah Heep Live, and hoped this performance would equal it. (I was unable to find ""Uriah Heep Live"" on CD when I purchased the ""King Biscuit Presents"" disc. Now that the ""Uriah Heep Live"" is available it seems to be missing some songs from the original LP release.)Uriah Heep was a great band , but this performance shows the effects of the road and substance abuse. I guess some things are best left to memories."
3,Average at best,"I like what this band is trying to do for the most part, but they need allot of work . If this is their best, they should quit while their ahead. That's just my opinion."
4,OK but!!!,"Comes with 5 vibration free spindles that can handle most of your contour needs. Poor dust management and sanding drums can work their way off the spindle. The sander does the job as well as can be expected for the price. The instructions are a little vague on how to install the sanding drums with the washers that are supplied. The parts list show on how they go on, but the written instructions tell a different way. The each drum needs a washer on top, but the 3/4"" drum does not have one. It will slowly work its way off then rubber. I used one of my own washers to stop it from slipping upward. The dust bag is almost useless and the outlet in the rear is non-standard for vacuum hoses. I made an adapter using the top part of a 2 1/4"" cone pickup tool that is glued with silicone onto a 2 1/4"" to 1 1/4"" hose reducer. This is a must and you will have a dust free sander."
4,Wonderful tool,"The tool is well made and for the price, it is really great. It is built very sturdy, and has a great work surface which is rock solid. The fact that it comes with all the spindles is a real plus.Have only one complaint. The spindle seems to be off center when it oscillates, just a tiny bit. By that I mean it backs away from the work on the up stroke and towards the work on the down stroke. It may be something I can adjust."
5,Excellent Spindle Sander,My shop is primarily all Delta products. So I wasn't surprised when I opened and setup my new spindle sander that it was excellent. Mine cam with the accessory kit and it did every job that I needed it to do. Setup was straight forward and simple. The cast Iron top makes it nice and stable and it doesn't move around on you. The top is also very large which makes larger projects a breeze. Overall another great product!
5,Small Shop Spindle Sander,"For the weekend or hobby woodworker this tool is great. Obviously, a 1/4 horse motor cannot give the power of an industrial sander.I mounted mine on a home made mobile cabinet with locking wheels so I can easily move it around my small shop. I especially enjoy putting a square edge on plywood prior to edge banding......now I have no gaps along the edge."
2,delta oscilating sander,sander turned on was easy to assemble minor assembly required the big issue is the oscillating function does not work. I need to contact delta deal with the headache of this process. If there is nothing that can be done i will return the item. I was not overly impressed with it.
3,A couple of flaws,"I've had my B.O.S.S. for several years. Yes, it's a relatively light-duty machine, but it performs reasonable well. There are two flaws that trouble me. One is that the sleeves consistently slide off the rubber drums and I'm unable to tighten them adequately to prevent the problem. I'm considering threading the shaft (if possible) so that I can apply enough pressure to expand the drum enough to hold the sleeves. Secondly, it would have been useful if Delta provided a shaft lock so that rotation is impossible while tightening the drum nut to tighten the sleeve. I may have purchased a machine that isn't up to my requirements (I build custom furniture full time), however it certainly hasn't been a terrible machine. Anyone purchasing one needs to realize that is a relatively inexpensive machine and you get what you pay for, as ""they"" say. If you need a truly heavy-duty machine this probably isn't the one you should purchase."
1,This thing is a piece of junk,"My wife ordered one of these for me for x-mas and brand-new out of the box, it didn't work (no oscillation). We packed it up and shipped it back for a refund. She ordered another one and it had the EXACT same problem. Again, brand new out of the box. I have a Delta scroll saw that works well so I have no idea why this product is such junk, but it'll be a cold day in hell before I buy anything else from Delta."
5,"Quiet, smooth, and powerful.","I looked at this machine for a long time before I bought it. I thought that the motor might be too small and that the unit might be under-powered. When I finally purchased one I was pleasantly surprised. The machine is very quiet and operates incredibly smoothly. There is no hint of vibration and even with a 3 inch spindle and moderate to high sanding pressure, the motor did not show any evidence of stalling. If you have a home of small shop and want a great little oscillating sander, this is the one for you."
1,Bad Delta Product....Nylon Gear Strips,"Opened the package, turned it on and in less than 3 minutes with motor on (didn't even sand anything) the nylon gear stripped making it completely useless. Reference other owners who had the SAME problem. The only saving grace was Amazon. I returned it without question and Amazon paid the UPS bill. Thanks Amazon."
1,Dead on Arrival,"Don't even think about it. I thought with all the negative reviews about this, surely Delta has corrected the problem with this not oscillating. So I ordered it, assembled it and turned it on. Guess what? It doesn't oscillate. I looked at the nylon gear and it was stripped. So back it went to Amazon. Amazon is great about returns, and I did get money back. Now I just have to decide on the Jet or Grizzly combo. Too bad you can't give 0 stars."
5,I love Delta,"Had to set the allen heads,but after that it works great, it's quite and does the job I need it for."
3,Very Sad Packaging,This necklace is beautiful even better then the picture BUT...the delicate chain came tangled and knotted. After a hour of working onit it's still tangled. Naturally it's a gift so I want it as perfect as it can be. I'm at the point where I may need to cut the chain and get a different one.Guess I'll try to untangle it some more. Can anyone loan me a magnifing glass? Just glad I opened and checked it before gift wrapping!!!
5,EXCELLENT BOOK....NO PROPAGANDA HERE!!!,"Don't know what the reviewer who only gave this book 1 star read, but this book is full of extremely accurate information. I have read a few of Shupe's other books and have researched much of his information to find him extremely credible and honest with his details.The Mormon church is very involved in some highly questionable, if not outright illegal, activity when it comes to their handling of church finances."
1,More uninformed and biased garbage,A review of this poor piece of work can be found on the SHIELDS web siteThe work is a highly prejudiced and uninformed effort. It will not lead the reader to correctly understand the LDS Church.
2,Bulgarian Tribulus,"I tried this product off & on for a month, and it made me feel lousy. Lethargic, sometimes lightheaded, so I gave it away. Maybe it's just me, but I didn't seem to have a good reaction to it. Only thing I may have noticed is an increased libido, but it did nothing for my energy level."
3,Tribulis,Little boost of energy and increased blood flow need something stronger going try eurycoma next. I have been using 1500 two pills for over one month.
3,Try it for yourself,"I had a testosterone blood test done due to acknowledging all the symptoms of low testosterone. Blood test came back at 347 and I'm 30. Doctors say my results are normal however I beg to differ. I tried the this product several weeks before the blood test and began feeling a significant change in energy around the 3rd week or so but nothing to dramatic. I will start taking this again to help boost my testosterone level higher to get my libido, energy and strength back like I used to have. This product will vary from person to person depending on your current testosterone levels. So this product can be a hit or miss. But in my opinion it's worth a try if your back is to the wall and you don't wanna go as far as using (Test) injections steroid to get your quality of life back. So don't expect to see a big change with one bottle give it some time to get in your system and work out hard to boost your natural test. Good luck"
3,3.5 stars,seems to be a tribulus product but havent taken tribulus in years. but i do remember twin labs tribulus fuel being even better then this
4,Mysterians,"One of Toho's best non-Godzilla movies. While the special effects aren't the best, it was also 1957 when this was made. Ifukube's score is one of his best, especially his millitary march. Very entertaining movie."
3,All this for 3 kilometers of land!,"Oh yeah the women... right...You can probably guess the quality of drama from the synopsis on the back of the box. No surprises here. Not much attempt at plot logic, either. Seriously, these guys could've got a lot further with dinner and a movie, but no -- they hafta' invade the earth.*sigh* I guess the more things change...BUT, the Tokyo-Shock Media-Blasters DVD version does include a commentary, some nice extras, new sound mixes, and a first rate transfer! Some minor scratching during the battle-sequences, but aside from that, excellent technical quality.If you're buying this for nostalgic reasons you won't be disappointed!"
2,Way beyond dumb,"I thought this was a movie I had seen when I was a youngster with my Dad, so I bought it. Turns out it wasn't. This thing makes Godzilla look like an Oscar Nominee. It's so bad it's funny. This dippy looking Robot with a pointy nose and light bulb looking eyes stumbles around crashing into just about everything. Maybe the guy in the suit had a very limited range of vision? If this thing were real it would pose no threat to anyone because EVERYON could get away from it. If you like Cheesy Japanese science fiction movies with terrible plots and bogus stunts that are so bad their laughable then buy the CD. Otherwise watch an old version of Godzilla again."
2,Not as good as their other two albums,"Bio Ritmo's three albums, Rumba Baby Rumba, Salsa Galactica, and Que Siga La Musica, all sound like they were done by completely different bands. They must have changed the lineup around between albums.Rumba Baby Rumba and Que Siga La Musica are both really good, but this album was kind of boring.Matt"
3,The Alpha Incident (1978),"A Mars space proble returns to Earth and brings with it a microorganism from the red planet. While transporting the microscopic alien life form by train, there is an accident and the microorganism is unleased. Exposure to the alient virus forces four strangers into quarantine while government scientists rush to find a cure."
1,Piece of Junk,"I purchased this machine from my local Lowes because I was in desperate need of a dehumidifier for my small basement. I loved it at first as it seemed to work great. The dampness in my basement dried up within a day and I was more than pleased. However nine days later it stopped altogether. I went through the troubleshooting guide, checked my outlets to make sure there were no problems with them. Still it would not come back on. I don't know how much good a five year warranty (which was included) is going to do me if I have to call every 10 days to have it fixed so I took it back. Time to try a different brand."
5,Overpriced,This price is ridiculous!!! I ordered the same watch from [...] for $399.00. There was no tax and free shipping. The presentation and wrapping were beautiful. I recommend that anyone interested in Burburry watches to shop around. I must conclude by saying that I love this watch. Thank you for listening.
2,Disappointing and shallow,"The first track of this CD does not impart substantial suggestions for self-esteem and I can discern nothing in the message regarding self-confidence. The second track seems to be identical to a track on Ms. Decker's ""Hypnosis for Stress Reduction"" CD, which focuses solely on deep relaxation and contains no message of self-esteem or self-confidence whatsoever. I am very disappointed in shallow nature of this CD and believe there is much room for improvement."
2,I didn't get any suggestions out of this CD,"The hypnosis CD's by Glenn Harrold work much better for me now that I've experienced someone else. I was hoping that the lack of music was going to make this CD a welcome addition to my hypnotherapy collection, but all this CD did was relax me.I was hoping it would build my self esteem (make me feel better about myself) and confidence but it didn't give me any afirmations. This was a waste of money for me."
1,Disappointed,This CD is a disappointment after reading good reviews. It is not worth the money and the all together it has about 10 minutes repeatedsuggestions about not thinking negatively. All other time CD is just about relaxation which I could get many elsewhere and WAY WAY better. I've seen much better CDs than this. I wonldn't recommend this to anybody and wish I could get my money back.
1,LAME!,"I'm sorry, but this CD SUCKED. I was hoping to get some positive inspiration and some self-esteem power thoughts out of this, but all it was about is learning how to relax your body. I think she touches upon saying something ""nice"" about yourself far into it, but the whole thing is setting you up for relaxing your body. That is NOT enough to train your mind to learn how to be more confident. This CD is a total rip-off. I want my money back!"
5,"EXCELLENT CD, Very Professional !!!!!!!","I have numerous hypnosis CDs and this one is by far the most professionally done. You have to relax your body to accept suggestions, and I found this CD did that very well. The content was very good... the induction, the suggestions, etc.She has a very soothing voice that is well modulated and well timed. I actually found it more relaxing without music on the CD than with."
3,"Okay, but could be a lot better","The speaker's voice is soothing and pleasant, but there are long pauses where she leaves you alone to imagine certain things. There are echos to certain words, which I found cheesy. The affirmations were not what I thought they should be: ""You have a right to be here. You deserve to be here..."" I know that already. I want to believe in more than that!!The one thing that I did like is the way she repeats herself really does sink in and you do start to feel hypnotized by her voice and words.The second track is not really about builing belief in yourself, but more about relaxing."
3,Not Shock resistant,"Although I like the features of this Pedometer/Speedometer, I've discovered that it is not shock resistant. If if falls off you belt, you lose your stats. When on my bike, it periodically reverts to startup mode and stats are lost. The concept is great, but to be really reliable, more work needs to done on the design. Made in China like many low cost products now days. Guess you get what you pay for!"
1,Dud,Does not work well. When mounted on a bike it was hard to get on and off. Also did not work well as a pedometer and broke after a month. Save your money and buy a nicer one.
1,DOES NOT WORK!!,I got the pedometer and from the start it DOES NOT WORK!! You have to physically shake it for it to count a step! I'm returning right away!
3,Spinner,The spinner looks nice on our patio but it takes a lot of wind to actually spin. It helps if you hang it from a piece of fishing line which twists easier than the swivel.
5,Great for hardwood floors,I have 2 dogs and a house with all hardwood floor with the exception of a couple of rugs. While my regular upright works fine on the carpet it is terrible on barefloors. I was using a shopvac to vacuum the hardwood floor...but who wants to lug a huge and noisy machine? I wanted something to do a good job on the floor but was small and not over $100.PROS: Lightweight; small head fits under beds and in tight corners; no bags to mess with (and I like that you can actually see what you have sucked up!); good suction; easy to store and has all the tools on board so you won't lose them; handle extends to various heights; easy to assemble and disassembleCONS: Doesn't replace a regular full size vacuum for doing carpet; collection cup for dust has to be emptied frequently; head seems a little bit flimsy...but will probably be okayI would recommend to anyone who needs a product to clean their hardwood floors!
1,Horrible pick up,This vacuum doesn't pick up a thing. I have hair all over my apartment and it just spits it back out. It also overheats easily so it makes getting the job done quick even harder. I'm only 5'4 and the height of the vacuum's handle even after its extended hurts my back. Don't buy this product!!
2,"Good suction, but disappointing overall","You can fix the short cord with an extention cord, at 5'10, I also thought the height was inadequate and IT IS A PAIN to change from the floor mode to the hose attachments. Most annoying of all is the constant emptying of the dust cup and cleaning of the filter!I miss my old Hoover or Eureka (I can't remember which brand?) electric broom. All these new fangled stick vacs have filters which are a pain and are impossible to clean!!!"
4,i love it,"I love this vacuum! I have all hard wood floors in my house. We also have two dogs. This wonderfully small and light vacuum picks up everything. Yes, the cord is to short and when vacuuming area rugs you need to go over them a few times. I own several vacuums...this is the only one I use. It works great on hard wood floors!!"
2,Annoying and only somewhat useful,"I live in a narrow and cluttered NYC apartment so I purchased this vacuum thinking that it could be used to clean up the floors and the attached hose could be used get under all the futurniture and other surfaces.It works ok at best on the open floor but when you get down on your hands and knees to try to get under the futons and behind bookcases, the exhaust ends up blowing the dust bunnies all over the place. Unless you cradle the body of the vacuum against your body so that the strong exhaust dosen't end up scattering the dust you were trying to pick up, it ends up creating a bigger mess than when you started.It could be extremely useful as its light weight and versitile, but the design flaws make it a complete waste of money."
2,Horrible suction....,"I am SO disappointed with this vacuum! I will say, it does wonderfully for picking up all that dust and little bits of dirt that get into your carpet, but don't expect it to pick up anything that is big enough to be visible to the human eye! Also, I have a cat - so I have pet fur on my carpet... AND I lose a lot of hair myself, and this vacuum doesn't pick any of that up... I can vacuum, run my hand over the carpet afterwards and come up with a handful of human and cat hair.It would be useful if you are just looking for something to get the dust and such out of the carpet... it seems to do that very well, though you are having to constantly stop and empty the vacuum, shake the filter out, etc, because it gets clogged VERY fast."
1,Garbage!,"I wish I had read all these reviews before I bought this piece of crap. It's completely useless. Unless you're are vacuuming a bare floor or constantly using it as a handvac KEEP YOUR MONEY! It overheats and doesn't pick up anything! They should give this thing away! Well, I learned my lesson."
2,Broke down within a year,It worked fine until it broke down after about 8 months. The cord is too short.
4,People are expecting too much.,"We've had 4 of these vacuums and wore 2 of them out over a reasonable amount of time. They are not meant to replace full sized vacuums... only to supplement them. I've seen a number of complaints about the expensive filter... there is a washable filter available! We use them on bare floors mostly or low pile carpet, they work great there. Deep pile carpet? Buy a Dyson."
1,The worst vacuum I've ever owned,"I picked this up a local BJs, wish I had seen the reviews on Amazon first. There are no rollers on this vacuum, just two rows of bristles. I have two cats, one's a long hair that sheds pretty quick year round. The bristles catch the cat hair, get full and then just rolls it around on the floor. I have a low nap carpet, and it still can't remove anything except the most basic dirt. The conversion to a portable isn't all that wonderful either, the button to release the standard vacuum head is a bit tough to push in, and the hose doesn't do a much better job than the regular floor head did. Save your money, and buy an old vacuum at a thrift store before you buy this turkey."
2,not as convenient as the infomercial,"It works well on barefloors and for vacuuming the car, but it doesn't pick up lint or pet hair off the carpet."
4,short hose,"I have only had this for two days. I have two parrots and need to clean daily around there cages, one on hardwood the other on berber. This little vacuum works great for this and the hepa filter make me feel so much better about where all the dander is going. the one drawback I found is that the hose is so short that reaching acrossed the top of the larger cage is a bit difficult. Also it is to tall to fit under the cages so I still have to roll them away from the wall or side to side. It was great on my throw rugs, did'nt try to eat them like my big vacuum would and got them perfectly clean with out shaking or beating which leaves a person filthy. All around I am thinking great for daily touch up cleaning."
1,Mine went straight to Goodwill,This vacumn was of no value for animal hair and dust. I have wood floors and expected this item to work great. It is not worth even $ 1.00
1,I could have done a better job with a straw,"This vac is an absolute hunk o'Junk!1)It over heats and turns itself off (after only 10 minutes of vacuuming) and it will not restart for at least 45 minutes.2)The dust cup or containment compartment is MESSY and difficult to empty, when removed it creates a huge dust cloud over the waste basket.3)I am convinced the replacement filters for this machine do not exsist, I have found not one retailer who sells this product that carries the filters.4) And as for trying to contact Euro-Pro, the maker of this marvelous machine, you can let the unit cool while you are on hold with customer service."
1,Not even a Vacuum!.,This is the worst vac I have ever purchased! I mostly used it to pick up a little scattered kitty litter off a bathroom rug and it couldn't even do that! And to pick up a piece of string or kitty hair?!! Forget it!! It mostly just pushed it into the carpet. It has no rotating brush and the suction is just awful! My 4 year old Eureka Cordless Boss Lite does a better job! I will never purchase this brand again.
2,Promises a lot; does not deliver,"After seeing the infomercial, I thought this was going to be an amazing little vacuum. It was supposed to be as powerful as a full size vacuum, but at a fraction of the size and weight. It could even hold up a bowling ball.After buying and using it for a while, I am disappointed. It takes several passes to pick anything up off the floor. It can not pick up long hair; instead it just bunches it up and pushes it around the carpet. The filter is hard to clean, and lint stays on it even after washing it with water. It is cheaply constructed and converting it to a handheld is not as easy as they say.It has a little more power than a dustbuster. It is not a full size replacement. It is not a super vacuum that can pick up nuts and bolts like in the commercials. It can barely pick up a piece of lint. This is a classic case of a marketing department promising way more than they can deliver."
1,Warning ! Danger ! Electrical Cord Problems!!!,"Why buy this unless you want to be exposed to bare AC electrical wires ? Yes, it's cheap, but it's not safe. I purchased three, and on the 2 that get used most, the stress relief molding where the AC cord enters the body of the vacuum breaks, exposing the AC wires. It happens because the cord gets wound on the storage loops and bends the stress relief part at too sharp an angle, and it cracks. The rubber material is of poor quality, and the design it dangerous and flawed. Euro Pro has issued no recall. Please bombard these neglegent fools at Euro Pro with your disgust. The number is 1-800-798-7398 or 1-514-842-8691."
2,Horrible Design,"1. To use the hose, you must stop the vacuum, remove the bottom unit, and plug the hose in. Shark claims this as a feature...but try it just once and you will see how useless this is. Simply put, the hose is useless for quick pick ups around baseboards.2. The cord is way too short.3. The handle is way too short. Anyone over 5'11"" will have a sore back bending over.4. The unit is hard to move on carpet, and does a rather poor job of picking up anything other than fine dust.5. Suction is merely adequate.I am returning mine!"
2,Does only what they show in the commercials.,"The EuroPro Shark Bagless stick broom is OK, but only at what the people show on those info-mercials. Although it cleans floors and low-thread carpets, it stinks, and I mean stinks, at cleaning high-thread carpets. My living room gets trampled on alot, and it contains high-thread carpets. I've tried to clean them with this shark, but it won't pick up hardly any dirt, and even leaves debris from its brushes in its wake! Now, I have had this vacuum for a year now, and the only place where it does OK is the stairway. Even then, the cord is to short to properly reach the top floor. The old Hoover I have can still do everything needed. If I would buy anything at all from EuroPro, it would be either the Shark EP708SH Spectra Bagless Upright, or the Fantom FM740 Twister 300SE Upright. Oh, and whenever I run that little Shark across the floor, it squeaks (Even after application of WD-40)."
3,Mixed feelings,"It's lightweight and quiet but it takes twice as long to vacuum my area rugs with it. Hair and stuff gets stuck in the brissles so you have to comb that out plus having to empty the container and clean it and clean the filter after every use, it's not the thing for rugs so I'm looking for a more appropriate one."
1,Worse Vacuum machine,"It has no powder, cannot pick up little things, even on the wood floor, and it gets hot and the machine shut off. It didn't carry out any tasks advertised on T.V."
2,No cat lovers here,"I was excited about getting this vacuum. It claims to have 1 1/2 times the power of regular vac. Not true. It picked up dirt and dust, but It would not pick up cat hair. A regular vacuum will. So the suction power is not a good as claimed. So back Target I go to buy a regular 11 or 12 amp vacuum..."
5,W-O-W-!!,"I was utterly shocked at the suction strength on this little vacuum. As I took it out of the box I had my doubts due to its size. However, the suction is phenominal, it works well or my Berber carpet, hardwood floors, and tile. The dust cup is a breeze to remove and it's also washable. Also, it takes up very little storage room.Note, this vacuum works very well for my small townhouse of 1,100 sq. feet. It wouldn't be the best choice for a large home."
1,"Very small, but...","I love the small form factor of these tiny usb drives; but, I really hate how very slow they are. The throughput is extremely slow compared to all the other usb drives I have. I have Sandisk, A-Data, Ativa, Verbatim, and a no-name usb drives and all are many times faster than my 4gb Sony Micro Vault. To load up 3-4 gigs, it takes several hours. To do the same on my 4gb Sandisk or 8gb A-Data, it is less than an hour.My tech experience is very high. My testing was done on a Vista Ultimate 64bit laptop. I also have 2 2gb Sony Micro Vaults and they are just as slow. But at 2gb, it was not such a big deal.If you just want something very tiny, then this is ok. But if you really also are concerned with performance, then buy something else. I recommend Sandisk.Scott"
1,Tiny and Unreliable,"After having owned one of these for a few months, it died. It sat unused for 6 months and then when I connect it to the computer it isn't recognized. Formatting doesn't work, and Sony's special format tool doesn't work. My SanDisk on my keychain has been abused, dropped, and kicked around for over 4 years without issue and this one sat in storage for six months and it's dead."
1,after 5 months mine is dead,When I saw this thing in the store I had to have it. I got it for $35 at best buy. when I first started using it I noticed it was really slow! I dont think this is a very useful 4GB drive. I think my DSL is faster!After about 5 months of using it 2-3 times a week it died. when I plug it into any computer it told me the device was not formated. I tried to format it but it would fail. I went to Sony's web site and there is a format tool to fix this problem but the tool failed. I called sony and they said it was a bad sector and thats why it will not format. I ask if this was a factory defect and they told me NO and that they would not replace it!!! After arguing with them for 45 min they said I could ship it to them for a replacement as long as I provide the receipt from 5 months ago.This might be the worst $35 I have spent.
5,major inspiration,"I can't even begin to describe what an impact this book has had on me. I read it for the first time in 6th grade, and since then my entire frame of mind has changed. I've found that I really love things like Monty Python, 80s punk rock, the Muppets, and so much more. So it (this book) has changed me a lot in that way, but it also is such an inspiration because of the fact that Christine never really let her cystic fibrosis pull her down into the dumps. She had ""spunk and a spirit"" for life, and that in itself is something to admire. In the dozens of times that I've read my copy of this incredible story, I've laughed, I've cried, and I've felt like I can actually identify with Chris...she was a regular girl who just happened to have a fatal disease. Her mom (Jaquie Gordon, the author) caputured Chris's life in such an amazing way, and I wish I could thank her for being so willing to write about it and changing my outlook on life."
4,Fantastic Game,"Descent Maximum is not just for teens because adults can play this game also. I am an adult and I play this game with a thirteen year old and it is lots and lots of fun. Glenn Rubenstein from the Editorial Review asks ""how much compelling gameplay does it offer in the long run?"". I would say that this game is very compelling and what he describes as confusing is what makes this game so much fun."
4,Excellent DVD from beginning to bonus footage !,"If you have no time to watch hours of ""The Secret"" this is a great substitute. All his DVDs are excellent this is my favorite one. This is also a great gift idea for students to business owners. You can watch great previews on YouTube then go make your purchase. You'll watch over & over again!!!"
5,Waiting ...,I would love to review this product but due to Amazon International shipping... I have not received it yet! After over a month!
5,Great confortable shoe,I don't usually buy my shoes online but I found that I love these shoes. They feel great and they are durable. I am glad that I purchased them.
3,Cute idea but a little cheaply made/ fun for the holidays tho,"I really like the idea of the product and i bought them for girlfriend who loves snowmen. when they arrived 3-4 of the snowmen hooks were broken and the metal hooks are pretty cheap and don't slide well on the hanging rod. I really like the curtain, it is very nice. the snowmen hooks were an easy hook with super glue and if you only use this during the holiday season i would reccomend this product as it will spruce up the bathroom."
1,Shower Curtain Rings,"Did not fit with shower curtain pictured. They were cute and matched, just did not fit. They could have been stretched to fit but used others I already had."
2,Flojos,"aunque son muy bonitos, se me caen mucho, se salen del tubo y al rodar la cortina se salen, son muy incomodos"
3,Cute,"These are cute but awkward...they stick out when you move the curtain, and fall off when moved side to side"
1,COMPLAINT,"I writing to you very upset because instead of receiving the ""Snowman Shower Curtain Hooks Snowmen Winter Snow Christmas Holiday"" I received the same courtain that I bought to you in November 2011. Sorry I did not ask for the curtain I WANT THE HOOKS. Now I have two curtains and I don't have ANY HOOKS. I'm outside the U.S. and I can't return the curtain. How can I buy THE HOOKS?. Do you have THE HOOKS?. I WANT THE SNOWMAN SHOWER CURTAIN HOOKS SNOWMEN WINTER SNOW CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY. Thanks."
3,Got here in a timely matter but was double to price,"This product came when it said it would. However, I had to go to the scout store to purchase a shirt for my son. I decided to look at how much the scout books cost there. I was surprised and a little upset that at the scout store the price was half as much as I paid for it. Other then that my purchase was fine"
5,GREAT,"Well, I am a play fan. so what can I say? It's GREAT. but really, I must not chase the boys is a fascinating song, a great change especially from the first album. faye's voice is so strong and extraordinary, and with anais as the other lead vocal in this song, it could be nothing but perfect. all the remixes are great, except probably for the instrumental, since it's after-all instrumental, but i would highly recommend it. the original is also not bad too!overall, a great single (:"
4,I Must Not Chase PLAY,"The single import is awesome! If you're a PLAY FANATIC you'll definitely love it. However, the original ""I Must Not Chase The Boys"" that they sing is much better than the remixes. The instrumental mix isn't that good at all. But, if you love PLAY, then you should definitely get it!"
1,"Basic shoplight, not worth $30 UPDATE: it's junk","I bought this item solely because it has a magnetic ballast and I want to operate it with a motion sensor switch that supposedly requires a magnetic ballast vs. the electronic ballast that it seems 99% of shop lights have.The fixture I received is very basic, and I can't see what warrants it being almost 3x the price of a similar unit from Home Depot...Update after several months of ownership: this is truly a piece of junk. It won't stay on for more than a few minutes before the tubes start to flicker maddeningly. I've tried swapping out the tubes to no avail. Avoid at all costs."
3,How about some styrofoam?,"It's a good cheap shop light. It does what it's supposed to do just fine. However....it was damaged when I received it. I was able to bend the sheet metal back into place and it works fine but looks wobbly. The light is packaged in a box, no packing material like styrofoam. Because of the size and long shape of the box it's going to get beat to hell in shipping.Once you get the metal bent back into place the lights are going to be a little tight when you insert them. Mine also had a little of the plastic housing cracked but it works so I'm not sending it back. -2 stars for the OEM's crappy packaging otherwise a 5."
4,shop lights,"I ordered these on Friday June 13th 2008 and received them on Tues. June 17These shop lights are made well. They DO NOT have an on/off pull chain. They come with two chains to hang them with. They DO NOT come with bulbs, we have not seen any that do. They do have a nice 5 foot cord. Most we looked at, do not. As for the shipping. The problem is not with Amazon,(they did a very nice job) it is with the manufacture. None of them put Styrofoam on the lights to protect the ends from damage. We ordered 5 of these lights and one of them was damaged, but it was where it would not be seen, so we used it anyway. After all shop lights are for use in the basement or garage. We are happy with this purchase and we did qualify for free shipping. We did buy them on sale for 10. So we felt like 50 dollars for five lights was real decent. I would not want to pay 15, you can get them at Lowes, for $12.88 plus tax and gas and avoid shipping damage."
2,Bare bones light,"Item is simple, 2- 48"" bulb(Not included) hanging shop light. No pull cord, must be unplugged replugged or used with switch operated outlet. Thin metal ,flemzy chain and packed so poorly half my order broke in transit."
1,Nothing about this was real.,"well it does not have a pull chain, if its under the plastic, then they should have sent a screw driver with it. The cord i have is only 3 foot long, it is only rated for 118V with a total of 75 watts. I had this thing plugged in for 30 seconds before it started getting hot, so hot I burnt my fingers taking the bulb out. Mind you I did not burn my fingers on the bulb itself, but the ballast. right away the lights were flickering. The way it was shipped it came all bent up. this light is far from quality."
1,Poor packaging makes product useless,Flimsy packaging didn't protect the lights during shipment.They were broken and unusable when I received them.I would not recommend buying these due to the headache of dealing with returning them when they come to you damaged.
4,Captain Abby and Captain John,"Coffin's writing style may seem a bit old-fashioned--knowing he is primarily a poet explains his prose style. He had exclusive access to the Pennell letters and diaries (which have disappeared, inexplicably, making this book even more valuable) and it is those sources he draws from to write the most compelling, and even heart-rending, passages in the book. He does not exaggerate; he almost adopts their Yankee reticence when describing adventures few Americans of their time even dreamed of living. An invaluable piece of American history."
3,It's a cute cd,"I was unimpressed with the songs that had kids singing them, it would be a better fit for a family. I did however enjoy the more traditional songs :)"
5,Hilarious and too true!,"My husband doesn't often enjoy sit-coms, but this group of people speak to the de-urbanizing of a life that much mimics our experience. We moved into an even more remote part of the world and we often feel like aliens studying a strange and new culture like anthropologists!"
5,Such a fun show for all ages!,"I happened upon this show when on a United Airlines flight to California recently. The episode they showed actually had me laughing...so I thought I'd try it out when I got home! We have seen almost the entire series...and look forward to seeing more. It is a very wonderful, unexpected and delightful surprise."
3,Jumped the shark about halfway through the season,"This series started out hilarious, but lost its way about halfway through the season. Maybe they just ran out of stories."
4,Tomorrowland - 'Stereoscope Soundwaves' (Darla),"Liked this title as much as I did their 'Sequence Of The Negative Space Changes'. Looks like they have been acquainted with guitarist Randall Nieman (Fuxa, Spectrum - as I saw Nieman play keyboard and guitar while out on a club tour with Sonic Boom of Spectrum a few years ago). Tracks that did the most for me were the inspiring ""Arrival"", ""IOOIOIII"", ""A Drop Of Golden Sun"" and the ten-minute sound epic ""Kepler Planet Harmonies"". Fans of Amp, Spiritualized, Brian Eno, My Bloody Valentine, the previously mentioned Fuxa and Seefeel should get the absolute most enjoyable spins out of this disc."
1,Doesn't work,"Downloaded from Amazon. Imported correctly to ITunes and WMP. However, copying to my iPod fails. How do you return a bunk digital download?"
4,Good for some uses,"I agree with some other reviewers that the unit runs on the hot side, but we've had ours for several years and it's still working great! My biggest complaint is that it is so good at sucking up dust particles that the filter quickly clogs and won't pick up larger items. Then the filter needs to be banged out in order to restore suction.It's great for vacuuming stairs and cars and small things...but I usually have to bang out the filter 2 or 3 times when doing the stairs or the car. Kind of a pain, but at the same time it's reassuring to know that it's getting that much dust out of the carpet.I would not use it for big jobs, but think it works great for small jobs. The biggest issue is trying to track down replacement filters...when I find them I usually buy a couple."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"I used my vac a total of 2 times. The first time I used it on my car for a total of maybe 20 minutes and it worked great! I was extremely pleased...until the second and last time of use. I plugged it in and used it for 5 minutes before it just quit running. There was no smoke or any other indication what the problem might have been. I let it sit until the following day hoping once it cooled down it would work. I returned it to the store that afternoon as it never did run again. I have no idea what was wrong, but I will never buy another Shark/Euro-pro product again!!"
1,UGH!,"I got this vacuum as a x-mas present and couldn't believe how strong it was and how well it worked, I loved it! Then halfway through the very first time I used it, it just stopped working. I let it cool down and cleaned out the filter, but it never worked again. I read that the filter has to be cleaned often, but I refuse to stop halfway between a light job to clean out my vacuum!"
2,not impressed,"This little thing is soo loud. I was using it to clean my carpeted stairs, which took forever, and the noise from it made my ears hurt. I am not really impressed by its cleaning power either. I ended up picking hair out of the brush after each stair...so don't waste your money on this thing."
2,Let's Get Real,"Let's get real here. Most of us don't have to pick up metal bolts with our vacuum cleaners. We do, however, have to pick up pet hair, dust & the like. This little vacuum doesn't work for everyday cleaning. I have hard wood floors & bought it primarily for the rug we keep in our dining room. My roommate & I had a race to see who could get the most cat hair off of the rug within one full minute. Even with the brush attachement & me working up a sweat, my roommate, with her bare hands, was able to clean the rug better than the ""Shark."" I wish I would have read the reviews here before I purchased such a worthless piece of equipment."
2,Mediocre,"Runs Hot & Loud with only mediocre suctioning power. I originally bought it to clean the inside of my car, but it takes forever to clean the whole thing."
3,cute compact and over-rated,"My euro pro hand held vacuum does not live up to my expectations. I had wanted a shark forever because of the ads, but when I got it home, I found out that it didn't pick up much...and when you were vacuuming for a while, it would over heat and shut down. I like the look of it, but my next vacuum will be a dyson."
1,Don't bother yourself buying it,"if you want to vaccum only metal bolts or some pebbles (not hair and dusts), it should be a good item.first time when i bought this, i thought that it was the best small vaccum i would ever have, but i was totally wrong about it.all the dusts and hair got into the machine and i had to take all the stuff out through the part where air goes out using tweezers. you would be really amazed once you see all the hair and dusts stuck in it. it's been too much hassle having this vaccum doing all the ""cleaning process""of the vaccum itself. The manufacturer must be very deceptive.this is my second vaccum and i think i 'll give it to goodwill and buy a new vaccum, but i haven't found any good one.never ever buy this vaccum."
1,Don't buy Shark!,"I bought a different model of Shark vacuum cleaner about three months ago at a Target store near my home. It's a different model than the ones sold on Amazon, but after reading the reviews here from customers who have purchased different models the results are the same: Shark vacuum cleaners die out after a few months, and even when they work for a few short months they are so high maintenance it's not worth it. Stick with Eureka, Hoover or another trusted brand. The only thing going for Shark vacs is that they look good....."
1,Burned out after less than 10 minutes!,"Worst vacuum I've ever encountered! Purchased to vacuum up pet hair, stray litter, and dust - didn't get to use it more than 10 minutes. First time I used it, after 2 minutes, motor was running EXTREMELY hot and I thought I smelled burnt electronics so I switched it off and checked the dust cup. The dust cup was virtually empty. I asked my husband if he smelled anything (which he didn't - yet...). Several hours later, I tried again and not only did the unit overheat, but glowing pieces of god-knows-what came flying out the back. THIS time my husband also smelled the burning! It's going back to the store asap."
1,"It Sucks, But Not in a Good Way!","Save your money and your time. This vacumn is a complete waste of both of them.The suction is adequate for light jobs, but the dust cup needs to be emptied often.Even with the shoulder strap, there is no comfortable way to carry it around.It gets HOT within minutes of turning it on.After approximately 5 uses, it shut off and that was the end of it. It's gone to vacumn hell and deservedly so."
1,don't waste your time,"honestly, i tried to find something good to say about this vacumn cleaner. alas, i could not find a big enough positive that would offset all the negatives.the predominant minus is the heat factor, this unit gets way too hot! as with any size motor, overheating will drastically reduce the motor life. the hepa filter may be a good thing, but the constant cleaning of it is time consuming and messy.it is cheaply made, definitely not built to last very long. i could say more,but i believe the overheating aspect should convince most folks not to waste their time or money on this unit."
1,Very Disappointed,"This product had adequate suction while it lasted which was about 4 months. One day it just stopped working, I can only assume that the motor died."
1,Why?????,"Why was this game even made? I loved loaded one of thee best games ever, I still play it. But this crap, I`d rather play Pong. Save your Money and spend it on something else..."
4,Nice addition,"Being a fan of female singers, and recently searching out goth related music, I stumbled on the song ""Every Day is Halloween"" on an internet goth radio show. The price was right on Amazon to take a chance. It turns out that other songs ""Never Let Me Down Again"", ""The Chauffeur"" and ""I Know There's Something Going On"" are also quite good even after multiple listenings. However, some other entries were not to my liking, especially for remakes of songs that are still well known.The bottom line: Worth getting if you can get it inexpensively, and I'm happy I have it."
3,Interesting but ultimately a novelty item,"This is an interesting set of covers that, while they don't wear thin, start to blend into each other. Very respectable interpretations of ""Never Let Me Down,"" ""Black Hole Sun"" and ""Karma Police."" A funny treatment of ""Yellow."" Not unenjoyable but bears listening only in small doses."
5,Tina Root as Tre Lux,"I bought this album with no expectations; it's been many years since Switchblade Symphony's last release. Tina Root has always been the greatest musical influence for mysekf as a musician and I was curious to hear what she had waiting for her fans. I was blown away. I knew this album contained covers only and her interpretations of all twelve songs on the album were amazing. My favourite were her covers of ""Karma Police"" and ""Black Hole Sun."" I cannot wait for Tina Root's next endeavor."
5,Best All Purpose Cleaner!,"I have used this stuff for probably 20 years! I use it for everything in the house, including floors and furniture, basically everything except glass and mirrors. Has a pleasant, non-chemically smell and leaves a very slight, non-slippery sheen. If I could give this to everyone I would! 10 stars!"
4,Story of...,".. persecution of Christians from the Anabaptist (Mennonite, Amish) standpoint. The book was first published in Holland in 16th century, then translated into German in Pennsylvania early in the 19th century. The English translation came much later, probably because while present day Amish and more conservative Mennonites still speak Pennsylvanisch (""Pennsylvania Dutch""), derived from SW German and Swiss German dialects, most of them no longer read Hochdeutsch so well as English. In his excellent history of German migrations into southern Va. in colonial times (""The Virginia Germans""), Klaus Wust recounts how late in the Civil War immigrant German Union soldiers from Illinois were shocked when, in primitive cabins above the Shennendoah Valley (Allegheny side) they found copies of the Martyr's Mirror in German. In any case, the reader is treated to brief accounts of beheadings, burnings, and drownings without pause."
5,Martyrs Mirror,This is a classic book on the Mennonite persecution during the reformation. It provided many details about these events and answered questions I had. The book is often referred to in other writings so it is a useful reference for my genealogical research.
5,Martyrs Mirror,"If you want true accounts of the persecution that took place by the Heretical church of the day and those that stood stong for their Biblical belief and died for it, this is a must read."
1,FIRE HAZARD,"Light failed to go off-it got so hot inside that the butter melted to liquid. The light unit was melted and BURNED.The top of the box was warped and blistered. On one website alone, there were over 130 exact complaints-if you value the life of your family-STAY AWAY!!!"
3,Military Woman,"The entire theme of this book was whether or not women in the military are too feminine, or too masculine."
5,Great for beginners,"This book makes great uses of friendly text and informative pictures and really shows how a PC is put together. I've never built my own PC before but now I feel like I can do it easily, and I'm already getting parts and putting them together. The mod stuff is really cool but I don't have some of the tools you need to do it, so I can't comment on how easy modding is with this book.I just wish the book had a chapter on installing Windows, it kind of leaves you hanging after talking about the hardware side. Otherwise, great book!!"
3,Good but not Great,"This book would be very good for someone new to the computer building world but does not offer much to anyone with average knowledge. Most of us know what a PSU does and how memory is installed. But if your new to building a cpu, then this is a good source of information."
5,Entertainment at a bargain!,The new systems are over-rated. The original xbox may not be on the bleeding edge of technology but there are a ton of games available and it's a bargain at today's prices!
1,Not worth the money.,"Being a fan of Connie's ""Funky Little Beat"" I decided to give this Greatest Hits complilation a try. Unfortunately I was very disappointed to find out that this album does not have the original versions of Connie's songs. All of the tracks contained on this disc are (rather lame) remixes of Connie's original hits. Best to look elsewhere if you're looking for classic Freestyle."
1,Made of brittle plastic...,"I received one of these brand new in the package. The clam shell wasn't easy to open and the tiny plastic pin holding it together broke when I tried to carefully open it. The plastic piece that is supposed to spin the disk does not move easily either and snapped off after just a few turns. I also tried the lens cleaning disk, but the system didn't recognize it long enough to spin (from what I could tell). Unless you are desperate, I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Down but not out.,"I can see that this was a cathartic treatment for the writer, but for the reader it dragged in places. I'm relieved to see that the writer finally saw the light and removed himself from the negative influence that kept him down. Many things influence our life, but they also form who we are in the present moment. This would be an excellent read for those trapped in similar situations."
1,Does'nt get much worse than this...,If you're in the mood for anticlimactic night vision video peppered with lame sound effects than you might like this. I really hope this is like a high school media project attempt and not a serious jab at anything close to serious paranormal investigating/documentation or even something that is supposed to be minimally interesting or entertaining...
1,Totally lame. I could have produced this with my iPhone.,"Honestly I think my iPhone would have done a better job. The graphics, commentary, EVP translations, and just overall cast were boring and Unentertaining. Don't waste ur time. The audio and video didn't even match up. There was at least a 30 second delay."
4,Works Great!,"Definetely does work. You feel increased strength the first time. I am stacking Gakic with Leukic and Creakic, with great results. You can actually feel it when you hit that sticking point. I felt myself fatigue in the middle of a bench set and then I had energy to push through that wall and squeeze off a few more reps. I could feel it at work. I feel like it has trailed off SLIGHTLY after a few weeks, but still WELL WORTH the $."
4,Bugskull - 'Crock' (Darla Records),"At first I wasn't initially sure of how many CD's that Bugskull had out and available. Tunes here that I was somewhat impressed with include the catchy ""The Lost Patrol Relax In The Sun"", ""Maggot Loves Pretty Boy"" (reminds me - maybe Spacemen 3), the awesome ten-minute epic ""The Lost Patrol's Psychedelic Exp."" (honestly, where do they come up with some of these song titles?) and the sixteen-minute (very) experimental ""The Cactus Corps"". Some fans would likely tag this piece as 'alternative indie rock'. Fair enough. Up to this point, I've encounter about five Bugskull CD's. Don't hold me to it, but 'Crock' might appeal to fans of Spiritualized, The Brian Jones Massacre, early Beck, some Residents and possibly The Orb."
1,Piece of junk,"You will get better results if you try blowing into the tire with your mouth. The ""locking mechanism"" is a piece of plastic on the back of the pump that makes a click when you push it down, but it doesn't lock anything. I took it apart and looked, it isn't attached to anything it is just a piece of plastic with a little knob that will make a click sound so it sounds like it should be doing something. This is a true rip off, a product actually designed to only seem like it is doing something."
4,BEAUTIFUL,"Anna Karina and Serge Gainsbourg's vocals are delightful and heavenly here... and if you can get your hands on this CD it is a rare treat. Indeed, it sounds incredibly contemporary and very seductive (as most of Gainsbourg's compositions are!)"
4,Great for those who want more than greatest hits comps...,"The price was a bit of a deterrant initially, but I simply couldn't imagine living another week without this after hearing the latest Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited album. I can definitely understand the apprehension of other reviewers, but think those with a taste for Serge's style won't be disappointed. After listening to such hits as Comic Strip, Bonnie & Clyde, and Je T'aime... to death, I needed something new and exciting. This totally hit the spot. I wish there were more album reissues like this that didn't cost an arm and a leg. Such a brilliant artist to explore."
3,Not as great as I remembered,The story is excellent but the acting was rembered with excitement and did not live up to memory. A little disappointing.
5,a sequel to stallion soldier by johnl shelly,"look at my review of stallion soldier by john l. shelley. cavalry sergeant was written ten years before stallion soldier and it is a very good western. first sergeant roger cooke was the perfect man to whip into shape a bunch of misfits the army believed were no good at all.with a poor commander,roger cooke was the glue that held the cavalry post together during times of indian uprisings and near mutinous condions.this book is now 52 years old but stands the test of time.if you love good westerns,you will love this."
4,A good resource book for Fibromyalgia.,"Defintely worth reading. A good reference book for those diagnosed with Fibromyalgia or those wishing to have a better understanding of FMS. I found the personal account of the author's experience very true to life. (I have Fibromyalgia.) This is real life, and those looking for a miracle storybook ending won't find it here. This book deals addresses the fact that Fibromyalgia is real and won't just go away, however it also deals with the many aspects of how people can deal with Fibromyalgia."
2,Green Tea,Got the product fine but the package is all in Japanese. I wrote a feeback to vendor asking for some directions in English but no soap or no tea. I'll have to trial and error this.
1,Poor product,"This is the worst product I have ever bought. I just picked up one of these and after ripping open the package found that the battery cover was missing. This irritated me but once I plugged the unit in, I was infuriated, the controls are sloppy and erratic and the range of the unit is horrible. I strongly advise anyone looking for a wireless Xbox controller to pay the extra ten 15 bucks and get one that works."
5,Xbox pro mini wireless controller,"Controller works great, came right on time and looked brand new and is being used today and still works just as great as the first day I got it. I recommend this seller and would buy from again."
1,this sucks,This is the worst controler I have ever owned. It stoped working after about ten days. DO NOT BUY THIS CONTROLER!The wires are extremely crapy and its not worth the time. I whould avoid wireless controlers as much as posible. and again THIS SUCKSSSS!!!!!!
3,"Good, but way too inferior to the Jaguar version!","You expect for one of the most superior game consoles to get a better version of Tempest 2000 to one of the best games that a failed console has to offer the Jaguar (let alone change the PS version to Tempest X3), well think again, it took out a few play modes and added useless visuals, which blocks you from seeing whats coming up ahead and also making this one much more difficult, the music is still the same which is good, but the sound effects changes and butchered. I'm not sure how to compare the PC/DOS or Saturn versions to the Jaguar, but i'm sure those versions are better than the PS version, but the Jaguar version is best, if you love the Tempest 2000 and haven't played the PS version, due yourself a favor and avoid the PS version. Just have better hope that Jaguar's version comes to Digital Download someday."
5,amazons.,"A very good dvd. It shows how the amazons were truly a tough bunch of women. Here, theyre more than a match for any foe."
2,Golden Temple Amazons review,"The quality of the movie, as far story lines, dialogue, locale and basic research was horrible. Where were they supposedly at, Africa or South America? Amazon warriors were trained better than depicted in the movie.The actual condition of the movie was excellent and it was delivered earlier than anticipated."
3,"Good for techno fans, not so great for others","You should not enjoy this song because of the video. Sure there are scantily clad women in it, but if you want to see girls in little or no clothing, there a whole bunch of trance videos you can check out.""Satisfaction"" is a decent song. It's not bad, but it's not great either. I guess if you're really into techno, you'll find it amusing. One thing I have to say about this song is that it is probably one of DJ Benny Benassi's best works... I really don't find many of his other singles ""listenable.""IMHO, I don't get much ""satisfaction"" from this song. Do people really dance to the sound of power tools while hearing a girl say ""Push me, and then just touch me, till I can get my satisfaction."" I guess some people get turned on by that, but I don't. To sum it up, if your a techno diehard, you probably want to check this song out. My two cents."
3,Good machine ... for bodybuilders,"This is a convenient blender, ideal for blending hot/ warm preparations, as the blender attachment comes in stainless steel. I used to have a Braun Handblender when living in Europe, but since I have all Philips appliances in my US home, I thought it would be good to keep everything in the same line. Big mistake. Compared to the Braun blender, this machine weighs double or more. After some seconds you are already tired. Perfect complement for weight lifters, to work out those lazy muscles in the fore arm every time you need to prepare a fruit shake. Then at the gym you can skip the biceps & triceps excercises."
2,Very poorly organized and packaged,"This collection of audio CDs is very hard to use. There is no readable index. It's almost impossible to locate individual poets. Some of the readings are okay, but this collection is put together so badly that I would never recommend it."
3,Where's Elizabeth Bishop?,"A Century of Recorded Poetry is a wonderful reflection of some of our most respected artists. I know an effort such as this cannot include every poet. However the omission of Elizabeth Bishop from this collection is confounding and mysterious. How could a poet of Bishop's magnitude and acknowledged genius not be included here. Was it an oversight? The producers explain that the poetry of T.S. Eliot and Gwendolyn Brooks is not to be found here due to permission and licensing restrictions, but there is no such explanation given for Bishop. This seems like an impossible oversight, especially considering that Bishop was so revered by many of the poets such as Robert Lowell, Marianne Moore, who are included."
5,"An exploration into myth, magic, and everyday life.","Gooberz, by Linda Goodman, is an excellent book, no matterwhat you are looking for. The philosopher, the occultist,the lover, and the mystery fan will all love it! Gooberzquestions the way we live, the way we worship, and ourvery concept of existence in a delightful and heart-warmingway. This is the spiritual mystery love novel that shouldbe on everybody's bookshelf."
3,compelling evidence mixed in with politics,"The analysis of the Patterson film was very good with all the supporting observations that were mentioned. Its a shame that only a part of the book dealt with this matter, a lot of the book dealt with the problems the author encountered with people who were against the whole bigfoot topic. I understand that it must have been very important to the author to let the public know how much obstacles he had to go through...and rightfully so...but it gets drawn out with the many letters he refers to and the rebuttals that he gives. But overall, the evidence in the Patterson film as seen by experts (in Russia) from different occupations shed some interesting details in support of the validity of the existence of bigfoot, details that are not readily apparent to the novice observer."
2,Book purchase,This wonderfully written beautiful book arrived in poor condition. The hard cover had deep gouges cut across the front. I successfully returned the book and was pleased to get a replacement very quickly. It was still disappointing though as this was a very special Christmas present.
5,Great book!,"What a great little story. It was in my book collection as a child, and now I have passed it onto my little dudes. It started their love for dogs at an early age, and even encouraged us as a family to get a beagle. She is a pretty little puppy named Snowy. Love this read and would reccomend it to anyone."
4,Excellent encyclopedia about MODERN islamic topics,"I had heard much praise about this encyclopedia. Still, I was hesitant to spend the money..... so I visited a library that had them on their shelves. I read and read, for hours - with pleasure! I then went home and placed my order.Each word/catagory/topic is well explained in plain and easily understandable english. The contributing writers are well established in their respective fields. (John Esposito is the editor and not the sole writer of this encyclopedia.)I can sincerely recommend this encyclopedia, for scholars, teachers, students all (muslims and non-muslims) interested in knowing more about islam and the muslim word."
5,Not to be listened to while driving,"Classified as ""space-rock,"" a term that even mystifies Windy & Carl themselves, this album does not rock. Windy & Carl are not about so much about ""songs"" as they are about gorgeous sonic textures. At first, the three tracks on this disc may sound like exercises in self-indulgence, but on more careful listening, the listener will discover the slight variations and the way the sound waves interact and play off one another. Sheer aural beauty."
2,extreme static,"as a fan of godspeed you black emperor, and other experimental epic bands, i found windy and carl through a perusal of kranky's catalog. if i hadn't bought this with a free gift card, i would've rated it a one. i am personally a fan of music using loops (boards of canada, hip hop in general), but the extent to which w&c play out their simple loops exceeds that of which i can tolerate. i once played this cd with the fast-forward button on, and i realized that i could hear the entire song in the first thirty seconds. the rest of the twenty minutes (in the case of the first song) is simply restating the same basic loop without any tangible alterations. i do not reccommend buying this cd."
5,Better than Martha!,"After years of searching through craft, decorating and gardening magazines and books, I finally found Martha (Stewart, that is). I never thought I could find another resource as innovative as her until I discovered Carolyn Roehm's seasons notebooks. The fall notebook is truly exciting. This is a book of inspiration, leading you to put your own spin on new ideas with halloween, thanksgiving, food, flowers, decorations and general entertaining and homekeeping. With help from the Fall Notebook, I designed the floral topiary centerpieces for my wedding. Her book also provided inspiration for the guests gifts and other personal touches.Carolyn's book does provide some recipes (great ones!) and directions, but with a notebook-style format (complete with ring binder and pockets as well as a lay-flat design) and large,gorgeous photos, this book serves as a starting point... a chance to get those creative juices flowing.You have to see it to believe it... Carolyn Roehm's got Martha beat!"
4,"Beautiful, extravagant photography","I love Fall -- it's my favorite season, so I wanted to love this book. I wasn't disappointed! The photos are sumptuous and gorgeous; the recipes are yummy and inspire thoughts of running straight to the kitchen; and the information about the flowers was truly informative. If you love Fall, you'll love this book."
3,Francesca's Song,"Francesca's song is called ""Senza Fine"" I can't seem to find the artist but if I do then I'll tell you! hope I helped!"
3,Great music for a great movie!,"The songs in the movie were pretty good but I was wondering if anyone knew how I could either find this song or what it might be called. It is the song in the beginning of the movie where Francesca, woman in the red dress, is singing to the passengers before they all die..."
3,"Who was the ""spanish-look-a-like"" singing on the ship?","Does anyone knows the girl that sings a song (i dont know the tiltle) at the beginning of the movie(Ghost Ship offcourse), and more importantly...what's the title of the song? is she the real singer of the song? Thx"
3,Title score?,"Hi everyone, I thought of buying this album but I really couldn't find the title music score? It includes an orchestral variation of Senza Fine theme. Is it included on the soundtrack?Your replies will be helpful. If it is on this soundtrack, in which title is it?"
1,the guitar song at the end...,the guitar song at the end for every1 that wondered is the new song out by mudvayne called not falling...i loved the strt but the rest is [garbage]...
3,Song that was playing during!!,The song that was playing in the movie that everyone keeps asking about is Mudvayne-Not Falling! Hope this was helpful for ya!!
2,francesca's song,"The italian song Francesca sings in the beginning is not on this soundtrack. It is called ""Senza Fine"" and it was dubbed for the actress (Francescsa Rettondini) by singer Monica Mancini. You can find it on some of Monica Mancini's albums. Now if someone can tell my wife where to get Francesca's red dress..."
4,"Where can you find the ""real soundtrack?""","All Right First of all the CD was really good. But at the end of the movie where the titles of songs are located and it tells where you can find the Soundtrack, has anyone been able to find, the ""real"" soundtrack? Like With ""Not Falling"", ""Senza Fine"", and ""My Little Box?"" All the songs? If anyone can help me out it would be very much welcomed!"
2,Frustrated at opening...,"I am a math teacher who purchased this item (February 2012) for use in an extensive review for end of the year assessments. I was excited about this product. Unfortunately, upon opening the box, I found the product to be broken at the top. Time did not permit me to return the item for a replacement, so I have rigged it to stay in place, using tape. However, I am extremely disappointed...especially given the price of this item. I need to find a company from which I can continue to purchase educational material for my classroom, but I don't think this seller is the answer."
1,piece of crap,"This is a cheap set. The racket stringing is so loose that the birdy gets stuck, one racket handle seperated from the head on the first attempt to hit the birdy, you won't be happy with this set."
2,I did not get the product I ordered,"I trust a name like spaulding, however the set that was sent to me was not spaulding. I would like to know if anyone else had this problem. I wouldn't have paid the extra amount to get something that I could have picked up at a store near me. I wanted quality for a fair price. I don't know if it will last for next season."
4,Price tells quality,"Don't expect too much with this price.If you are not a serious sports player, this set will work for you."
5,Unbelievable,"Having had listened to many a house tune or dance track...most of them are quite boring, however this one really caught my attention by having a really different style of mixing riffs and filters to make a really out-of-this-word disco-ish dance tune.Very different and refreshing, awesome vocal edit as well, even though the instrumental is just as good.Listen up house/dance djays....like myself, make sure this baby is in your recordcase!"
1,All About Crap,"This could be the most poorly conceived and written book ever. After skimming a few of the alphabetized entries, it became apparent that this was written in a stream of unconsciousness and that the mythical 'editor' was asleep at the wheel. I've seen better prose on bathroom walls.After reviewing what I have written, I am thinking that it is still too flattering of the book. I want the 3 minutes of my life back I wasted even considering this book!"
3,"Not essential, but an ok sampler, but why not just get HOT","There is absolutely nothing wrong with the music on this cd, it is mostly ""Hot jazz"" and excitable dixieland music with the energy of a punk rock band! However there is no reason to acquire this cd at all, you should just buy thier cd ""HOT,"" which has all of their hottest jazz sides, and best vocals, and the exciting trumpet solos of Duke Heighter. If after you buy HOT, and you need more, buy Perinnial Favorites, and that's all that is essential. This cd has a sampling of thier cd's, but this cd leaves off a bunch of essential tracks from thier exciting and creative HOT set, which is by far more essential. Only pick this up if you can get it at a low budget price, otherwise HOT should be easy enough to find at used cd shops in the USA, or Tower Records."
5,Out of the ordinary,My daughter loves this group. She is in middle school. It took me forever to find. They have a sound all their own. If you like Big Bad Voodo Daddy or swing you might enjoy this as well.
5,Recommended Regency Read!,"This is a great little book! So many regencies written today are pretty mundane, but this is a happy exception. I read lots of regencies and this is the best I've read in a long time. It's a little gem! I highly recommend it."
2,Farcical,"This silly story depends on misunderstanding after misunderstanding to drive the plot. Cardboard characters act in predictable ways, and it's utterly lacking in character development or witty conversation. The H & H meet in passing; after one afternoon in her company he decides he's in love with her, and the rest of the book is a series of farcical upsets that create an on-again off-again relationship. It's not badly written (something of a bonus these days), but the only way it could be considered delightful or charming would be if one had never read Georgette Heyer or early Amanda Quick or Loretta Chase."
3,Fluff but enjoyable fluff,"Okay, it's still another book about gay relationship angst, but Ford puts it together engagingly if not always plausibly. The plot is pretty standard--boy's BF cheats; he's shocked and disillusioned; flees to Ptown to sort things out; finds family, a new profession and a dynamite new BF, but not without some obstacles and false starts. The characters are on the good side of cliched and for the most part, the reader cares about what happens to them. Everything rolls to a predictable ending, but what the heck, it didn't take long to read and the ride was fun. Yeah, good for the beach or a transcontinental flight."
3,Pretty good...but too spanned out,"I loved the detail on all the couples and love and sex, but i felt that the book was way to spanned out where instead of just following one group of people for a while it makes you go to all the other characters so if you dont like some characters or their stories you can get bored i liked the parts with ty and reid and with josh and reilly"
5,Ford's novel equal to his nonfiction,"I loved Michael Thomas Ford's previous books and this one is no exception. His characters are believable, the situations they get into at times poignant and at other times very funny. I love the fact that he doesn't just write about the usual ""pretty boys"" or ""depressed HIV/AIDS survivor"" as is too common in gay fiction. I hope he writes another novel because this one rocked!"
3,Good... But Not Great,"Overall I enjoyed ""Last Summer."" It's fitting that ""summer"" is in the title because it's perfect summer reading: light and fun. It seems like the author is going for a Northeast version of ""Tales of the City,"" and Provincetown couldn't be a better backdrop. The book isn't without flaws, though. My main gripe is that I think Ford tried to accomplish too much. The book contains quite a few storylines. All of them are pretty good. However, he spreads his net so wide as far as the number of storylines that unfortunately we never get to go very deep. All the storylines were interesting, but there wasn't enough time spent on each character for me to care a great deal about them. This could have been solved by cutting one or two of the storylines or just having a longer book. But don't let that stop you from reading this. You'll enjoy yourself - though I doubt you'll be moved."
4,hot and solid,"With a cast that Almost requires endsheet flowcharts to keep them untangled (think War & Peace) this novel ultimately unfolds like a useful highway map.I had to work at it a little in the first 100 pages but the charcters are indeed believable and the story line(s) fun.A good read with some interwoven serious thoughts ranging form why perfection breeds boredom to why gay relationship, lacking role models, are difficult. It was good to be fed some brain food as well as entertainment. I have given it to friends, all return it with a smile and thanks. Is there a better measure?"
5,Marcus Monteiro,"This book is for people with some knowledge on SAR who likes to know mathematical theory behind SAR processing. The authors focused their attention on satellite boarded radars, leaving in second plan problems faced on aircraft boarded SAR systems."
4,Nice quality but pricey,"I was trying to find an unrefined shea butter, so it seemed that the reviews for the product are generally good.The product is very nice quality--of course it has the unrefined shea butter smell. What is also nice is that it is not terrifically hard; it does not take a ton of effort to dig a small amount out to use.I pulled a star off, however, due to price. I've found other shea butter that is produced by fair trade, which is a lot more inexpensive than this product. The stuff I got, though, was of a harder consistency, which I did not care for much, but the quality seemed to be on par with this.What IS nice about this product is that it is softer and comes in a nice jar....other stuff I've ordered comes in bags. I would order both, probably, because I like to keep the containers that the AAA Shea Butter comes in."
1,"Bad Smell, Questionable Purity","This product had a very rancid smell and a sticky texture. I think the shea butter may have been mixed with something, but definitely was not pure. More greasy than moisturizing. Very disappointed that I spent money on this when I've gotten better shea butter for way cheaper."
3,"Seems OK, but no expiration date","This product has a faint smokey smell, like the shea butter that I had purchased from another supplier. It is much better quality though. This is a good quality butter, which spreads and absorbs easily once you rub it between your palms. It has an ivory color, and I feel good about the fact that it has certified by ASBI, so must be a genuine shea butter. Gave it three stars because there is no expiration date on the jar."
3,"Too greasy, but it does hydrate","I bought this shea butter a while ago, after reading all the good reviews, and knowing that shea butter is great for your skin!I wanted to like this cream more, but I just don't care for it too much.... because 1st, it's as hard as a rock! Especially when it's a little colder2nd, it feels soooooooooooo greasy, it's the most greasy cream I have ever used! And thus, it takes FOREVER to absorb.I still give it 3 stars, because I don't hate it, and I'm still using it. It does hydrate your skin well, I mostly put it on my legs, thighs, butt, and elbows. And plus, when I ocaasionally put it on my face, it hydrates my face too! And doesn't give me any problems, like pimple breakouts or anything bad!I recently did a little more homework, and bought some other shea butter creams, which are not 100% shea butter but nonetheless all natural ingredients, for better and faster absorption, from Nature's Shea Butter."
1,Smells like diarrhea??,I have used products with Shea butter in it but never pure Shea butter. I just received this and I opened up the tub and this strong diarrhea smell came pouring out of the tub. Is this the way Shea butter is suppose to smell because it is the sickest smell I have ever smelled in my life. I put some on my hands and the smell is deep in my pores. I thought it was suppose to smell nutty and pleasant not like a babies dirty diaper. Maybe it's rancid??
5,Ended too Soon!,"This game was very addicting. I love puzzle type games and this one was exactly what I was looking for. I was very sad when I finished all of the puzzles, I tried to play it again and it just wasn't the same. Hopefully they will come out with a second edition."
3,Game review,Fun and keeps your attention. I don't like the zoom effect and not being able to see the whole puzzle in that mode.
3,Drats!,"The bad news: I really loved this game until I got to the 15x15 puzzles. It is too confusing zooming in and out, I need to see the whole board. That's a big part of the game that I won't even use. The great news? The wi-fi play is REALLY fun and challenging."
1,It's ok at the beginning,The game seems like fun at the beginning but then the puzzles get long and tedious. I would only recommend this product if you have a lot of patience.
2,missed opportunity,"super mario picross (only in Japan on Super Famicom, or now on virtual console for wii) is much better. It has more options, more puzzles, etc. My biggest gripe with Picross DS is it only has a SINGLE save slot, meaning if more than one person in your household wants to play it with their own progress (i.e. without seeing the solution for already solved puzzles), you're out of luck, or have to buy a copy for each person. What was Nintendo thinking??? :p"
4,Pretty good!,"This is a very good game for those times where you're in the waiting room with your ds. I wouldn't suggest this for car rides, especially if you get nauseous concentrating while riding like me.My only complaint is the music...very repetitive...so if you have an mp3 player or an iPod, it'd be better to use that as music. Well...yes the gameplay is repetitive, but it's fun to a challenging point because each of the puzzles are different.I would actually rate it 4.5/5."
5,Done in time for #3,"This game replaced the original (Mario Picross) as my night-time sleep inducer. I've probably spent a few hundred hours playing the game and all of the online downloadables. It was a nice evolution from the original, and I'm expecting the new one (Picross3D) to add an even newer spin to Picross."
4,"Wow, I'm hooked!","I heard a lot of good things about this game but didn't know what to expect. Not being a big Sudoku I was worried if I would like it, but for the budget price it was worth a risk. After two days I have to say that am completely hooked. It's gotten so bad that I have been having dreams about Picross tiles :(There's incredible value in this budget title. Even if you manage to burn through the bundled puzzles, you can jump online and download free add-ons from Nintendo. At this time of this writing there are four Mario puzzle packs available. Plus it has ""Brain Age"" inspired ""Daily Picross"" that keeps you coming back every day for new challenges.My only complaint is that the interface for 15x15 puzzles is incredibly clunky. It takes a lot of getting used to but it's not a show stopper.This style of game is the exact reason I purchased a DS."
2,"Fun, but too few puzzles!","I love picross puzzles; I've been addicted to them for almost 10 years. This game is fun, but unfortunately, I finished this game in one weekend.For an avid picross solver, this game just didn't furnish enough of a challenge. The grids were too hard to navigate with the stylus so I resorted to using the buttons instead. The numbers were hard to see and the size of the grids was unsatisfying.The game is great for beginners or anyone who wants an introduction to picross puzzles, but unfortunately, it's just not worth the money for anyone who is beyond a beginner level."
1,Cheap and Muffled,"I have seen many instructional videos in my time and this one is the worst. Not only does the quality of this video set a new standard for cheapness but, the instructor can't even play! The video appears to be shot on a low quality camcorder in someone's very depressing living room. The sound quality is so muffled and distorted I thought my speakers were blown. And all this in the first two minutes! I could not help but to laugh out loud knowing I had been ripped off. If you are thinking of learning to play the trombone then do not get this video. The only thing this video will do is discourage you from being introduced to a most wonderful and highly rewarding instrument. Warner Bros. should be ashamed for putting there name on this box of garbage. Buyer be warned."
3,Not All Bad...,"In fairness, this video CAN be used as supplemental instruction for beginning students and/or their parents. In my case, it served well for my substitute teacher to use when I was out sick during the third week of school. By writing a good worksheet, I was able to focus my students' attention on a review of the ""basics:"" posture, breathing, instrument care, etc. The worst part of the video is the excrutiatingly dull ""Music Theory"" lesson. In addition, both presenters just seemed to be scared to death to be on camera. It's not great, but there's some useful stuff here."
2,not so professional,"This curling brush has plastic teeth which easily disengage from the barrel and fall off. Since I got no direction booklet with this item, I don't know if there is a remedy. Doesn't appear to be one."
4,Pricey Professional Headset,"This headset is pretty much the top of Sennheiser's ""pro"" line, and isn't really a consumer product. That said, if you're looking for a really solid headset that's been designed to take daily abuse and that has a brilliant microphone, this was worth the steep price.Caveat Emptor: the connector on this headset is a proprietary Sennheiser quick-release. If you want to connect this to your PC, you need to buy a CEDPC1 adaptor. If you want to connect this to your phone, you'll need to purchase the appropriate handset connector. Check sennheiser.com for a very complete list. These adaptors run about $15 - $20.Used for VOIP and online chat, this headset is a godsend. It's comfy for hours on end, and it's ability to pick up your voice without picking up background noise is uncanny. It also adjusts and folds in more ways than I expected, and is easy to move from one ear to the other."
1,Worthless book,"The book is extremely sketchy and is comprised of java and j2ee notes. The explanations are skimpy and does not provide clear understanding. There is not enough depth for it to be a useful reference, nor enough breadth for it to be a handy learning tool. Move on to something else."
4,Good book for J2EE,"Few years back when I bought this book, I only had little experience with Java and creating dynamic Websites. Just by following each page of this book, I created my first chat system in Java, online banking application and a music store. I do not think this book is for beginners, who would like to learn java, but I was already into programming and I liked most parts of this book."
3,Pretty Good Textbook,"The texts are well chosen, though perhaps less well edited. It's great to have Plato, Erasmus, Derrida, and Cixous all together, but I think the book could have been more carefully done. I think there's much in the selection from Aristotle that could have been cut, and much from Quintillian that should have been included (material from Book III, for example). The Cicero abridgement is poorly done--it's difficult to infer who's speaking at the beginning of the selection from Book II. Boethius doesn't really need to be here, and it's difficult to see how the Kristeva essay really has anything to do with rhetoric. And the introductory sections are not what they could be. Often, difficult technical terms in the selections that follow them are NOT explains and defined clearly in the introductory notes. This is a usable text that is not carefully done."
5,interlude perfume,"i have worn this perfume since i was 18 yrs. old, i'm now 65. I get compliments everytime i wear it. MALES LOVE IT."
3,Interlude Bath and Body Perfume,"I am a little disappointed in these bottles. Somehow they do not smell the same as my older purchases. The color is lighter, but the smell is different also. I will still use it. Thanks"
3,Interlude,"I was somewhat disappointed, as the original, as I remember was somewhat denser and definitely had a scent that stayed longer."
5,A True Signature Scent,"I have loved this perfume for years. Once worn it becomes a signature scent becauses there are no cheap knock offs around. This is a truely sensual scent designed for women who are confident, and who enjoy being a woman."
1,There's got to be something better....,"I was really disappointed in this text. It was required for my wound care class; I did not find it helpful at all. There were only a few color pictures in the front of the book. I feel that they could have been at least put in with the section or chapter that they were illustrating. Also, several of the practices and methods written about in here are out of date and are therefore no longer apply. Reading the text and then going to lectures was sometimes confusing because of the conflicting information. So many things have changed in wound care since this book was last updated. I certainly would not recommend this text."
2,wish i was assigned a different text book,"was required by my school, thats why i cought it. has a lot of typos in it, and doesn't explain the experiemnts very well.Very marginal over all"
2,Everything a chemistry textbook should not be,"Horribly written. Painfully disorganized, bouncing from technique to technique and concept to concept at COMPLETE random. Zero photo plates and minimal line drawings that aren't recognizable as anything actually seen in a laboratory. Structural formulas that look like they were produced in MS Word. In fact, the whole ugly layout has this appearance. The $107 price tag must have been a belabored attempt at humor."
1,Terrible for a real Organic Chemistry Lab Course,"This was the first term that the Chemistry department at my school had us use a textbook rather than giving us their own theory and procedures. This book is bad for doing these labs if you want to understand the lab and the techniques. the procedures in it are mostly understandable, but there are bad grammatical errors that make the instruction unclear and confusing. When I tried to read the theory that was written in the beginning of the chapter, I think I might have actually forgotten some of the chemistry that I already had known. That is how badly written it is. I did a lot of these labs before, but reading the procedures in the book made me doubt my own ability because I was not sure whether I had did it right before (even though I had) because I did not know what the authors were trying to say."
1,AMAZON sent me a new book with the pages falling out.,"I bought this book new and Amazon sent me a new book. At first everything looked good so I started writing out my lab and highlighting important parts. Next thing I know, the pages start falling out of the book! I could NOT return it because I had already marked the book and I needed the book for lab and Amazon would not ship me a new one w/o sending back the one I had. Also, Amazon does not want to be contacted because I did not find a phone number to call them and emails are a waste of time."
1,I could have learned better if a better book were used,"Agree with all the older reviews. This book is unorganized, and clumps all the information together, which made it more difficult to comprehend. Kind of boring to read too."
5,Santa clause soundtrack,A must have for people who love the movie. Good music and you'll remember parts of the movie as you listen.
2,Where are all the songs?,"Yet another disappointment in Hollywood soundtracks. Another one of those ""music inspired by"" coasters. A few songs missing in the album have my children playing the overrated DVD over and over again just to hear them. Stuff like; Molly Shannon's embarassing rendition of ""Feeling like a woman"" Santa remix and the poppy ""Naughty Naughty Boy"" song played while young charlie defaces the gymnasium wall. Please someone tell me where I can find these songs so that I may plug headphones into my childrens' heads!"
5,Nice book,Great food fixin's.....highly recommend it to the person wanting to cut calories. Bought it for my girlfriend and we are both enjoying some of the ideas inside.
5,Best Light Cookbook Published,"As a long time Cooks Illustrated fan and subscriber, I was so happy that they published this book. I recently ordered this book and have already prepared ten recipes. Each recipe was well written, easy to follow, and delicious. In typical Cooks illustrated fashion, they tested out several strategies for each recipe to find the one that would provide a low fat, lower calorie alternative without sacrificing taste.I have many ""light"" cookbooks in my library, but none have impressed me until now! This book will now be my primary, everyday cookbook. I am so pleased with it, I have already ordered two additional copies as gifts for friends and family."
5,I love this cookbook,"Everything I've made out of this cookbook tastes great. The brownies are wonderful, along with the chocolate sheet cake (to die for!), and the hummus too."
5,Every recipe a winner.,"The recipes in this book are amazing. I've always loved The Best Recipe series, as well as Cook's Illustrated. This cookbook goes a step further by lightening up their amazing recipes without losing any of the taste. I bought one for my neighbor too."
3,Virtually no pictures,"This book has several appealing recipes to offer, however, most of it is in black and white with virtually no pictures, except for a few colored ones in the middle of the book. A cookbook with pictures helps me to better decide which recipe to make. This book also reads like a novel and not a cookbook, with very wordy with lengthy explanations for each recipe. If you like black and white cookbooks with more ""fluff"" than recipes, then this cookbook is for you."
3,3.5 rating,"I received this cookbook as a gift. While I haven't tried any of the recipes yet, I like the explanations and suggestions for lowering the fat content without sacrificing flavor."
3,Love this cookbook!!!,Great reciepes!I really like all the information on products tried to achieve the best tasting results.I have one for myself and I bought this book for my Daughter.
1,Many pages with few recipes.,"This book could have been a lot thinner. There is way too much text explaining how CI arrived at each final recipe. Maybe that is OK for the magazines, but I'm really disappointed. A cookbook should be jam packed with recipes. I don't intend to read it as a novel. There are some good tips, like how you line a pan to easily remove brownies. A picture is enough and we do not need a thousand words on top of that. Save your money - don't buy it."
2,Not so thrilled,"I found the recipes for the mac n cheese, lasgna, and bundt cake online from this book (at the cbsnews website) and decided to try the mac n cheese recipe before shelling out $22.00 for the book. I followed the recipe. While the mac n cheese looked like it was going to be good, it didn't really taste so good. I don't think I'll put up the $22.00 to purchase it. I'm actually surprised by all the raving reviews. Perhaps it's just different taste buds. :("
5,RE+LOADED -- Great Album Ever!!,"I Already Enjoyed the original Release of ""EL SEXTO SENTIDO"" But this 4 Additional Songs Just Make The RE+LOADED So much Better!!In The Song ""Cantando Por Un Sueno"" Thalia's Show Her Real Talent, And The Way She Do High Notes Is Incledible....THALIA U ROCK!!!"
4,great CD,It's really a great CD I love all the songs and the hit *un alma sentenciada- remixed* it's one of my favorite's I alsow love the song that she made with Aventura *No No No* I think it would be a hit
4,Class of `76,The Wilco comparison is valid. get the expanded version of this album for some great tracks that remind me of early Bowie's acoustic music.
4,Chocolate News 101,"I just finished watching this free episode on Amazon.com On Demand and laugh the whole time. David Alan Grier is brilliant, funny, and exciting to watch. Thank you for keeping it Real David."
3,"Chocolate News(2008 tv series,Comedy Central)","Chocolate News is Semi-Funny,when it comes to the segments,David Alan Grier is Hilarious,but I can see why Comedy Central canceled it after one season(there still is no DVD set for it,I saw it on netflix-free). It gets too political and too ""Anti-Whitey"". it gets boring after a while. It's a Shame Because I really like David's Style from his days at In Living Color and his character on Men on Film(and men on books) as well his Maya Angelou and His role in An American Carol,but his obamatalk all the time can drive a sane person nuts.David Alan Grier could do better."
5,excellent followup,"This cd is an excellent, rockin' follow up to their first. If you haven't seen them live, do yourself a favor and see them. They are a blast onstage. They just get up there and have a great time."
3,Mission half complete,"Easy listening country-pop but not as good as the first album. The duet with Willy Nelson is ordinary at best but what were they thinking when they recorded ""Love Is A Ball""? I haven't heard worse lyrics in a long time."
5,Great CD!,I love this second effort by Trick Pony. Love Is a Ball is one of my favorites on the album and on my Ipod for that matter. But then I'm not under the assumption that every song on an album has to be as deep as the ocean.
4,griddle carry bag,So far we are very pleased with the carry bag for the SG90 griddle. We haul the Campchef stove and accessories in our motor home. Keeps everything clean. Amazon sent it promptly.
3,Carry Bag,Works great...would be better if it was a little heaver as my griddle weight is significant. The product over all above average = good.
2,Too Big,"I ordered this and the Camp Chef Lumber Jack Over-the-Fire Grill (OFG24)Camp Chef Lumberjack Over-the-Fire Grill with Sturdy Legs. I selected this because it was listed as ""Frequently Bought Together"" and on the Camp Chef web site it listed this as the bag for it.It is about 6 inches longer than required and 2 inches taller than required to hold the Grill. The result is that the Grill shifts around inside the bag and takes up a larger than required space for storage in my RV.I would recommend a different Grill/Bag combination if you are looking for one that has a storage bag."
5,Audio X-Rocker,"Just bought this chair over the weekend. Very well made, comfortable and the sound quality is exceptional. My son loves this chair. The arms on the rocker make it even better. I thought he wouldn't need them on while playing guitar hero, but he rests his arms on it. The only thing is that the chair seems to tip when someone weighs less than 100 pounds. Other than that it is an awesome chair for the price. I bought this chair reading the reviews and agree with everyone; money well spent."
4,Nice product - great price,"I bought this item for my husband as a Christmas gift. He really enjoys using it, not only for gaming, but also for listening to music (it can also be used for movies). The in-seat speakers (actually they are located on the sides of the chair back) are great and have a ncie sound quality.The chair itself could be prone to tilting back a bit too much, but only if you're moving around a lot or being rowdy.The seat is comfortable, leather seems of good quality and was pretty easy to put together. It is quite heavy though.Nice control panel on side of seat, arm rests are padded and there are little storage pouches too.Generally, a really nice item and a great accessory for a gamer. And a nice price, too. I've seen some models for twice what I paid."
4,X-Rocker,"I bought two of theses chairs, one for myself and one for my son. We both like the chairs. They have good sound quality and they don't look out of place in the family room. I use mine for my multimedia computer and my son uses his for tv, gameboy and his computer. They have built in audio amplifiers with volume controls that power the two speakers and sub-woofer. The other thing my son likes about the chairs, you can daisy chain the audio to another chair. This comes in handy when playing multi-player games..There are two cons though. It is easy to lean back too far and tip over backwards. The chair needs more padding in the seat since you can feel the frame under the seat. I am only about 160lbs, so i am by no means over weight and the chair does get a bit uncomfortable after an hour.Over all the X-Rocker is a really cool chair. We looked at quite a few gaming chairs and for the money this one was the best deal and had the highest ratings."
2,xbox chair,I bought this chair for my son's christmas present in 2008. The chair itself is very durable; however the guts for the speakers became loose within a week of use and they rattle around and it no longer works. The chair is very heavy and I choose not to try and return it. I was very disappointed that I basically spent the money on a broken product.
2,it was ok...,Thing that wasnt so good is the fact that it doesnt work with HD. or what not just a simple old tv. I was told when I called we could make it work but tsk they said it would have instructions and it didnt. OH WELl. so we just sold it to a friend. wont be purchasing this again. Although its comfy =)
4,small tear,This was bought for my 7yr son old last Christmas and was a hit. He uses it to watch movies and play video games. We have yet to hook up the head speakers as he seems to love it as is. The delivery was very prompt HOWEVER in transit the left arm rest developed a tear the size of a dime. The chair came days before Christmas so sending it back was not an option. A little tape UNFORTUNATELY does the trick.
3,"Comfortable chair, fast delivery, sound does not work","Love the comfort of the chair and the purchase and delivery were great; however, the sound does not work on the chair. To be fair I did not contact the seller because at that point the only recourse I could see was to maybe swap out the chair and the chair is too big to deal with that."
5,Best dog bones ever!,"hard to find treats but they outlast any other one I've found, especially the carrot etc, bones, worth the money"
3,A lifetime of caution...gone in one night,"Angela Capria had never experienced that crazy desire that makes on forget caution and succumb to passion. Then a fascinating, exhilarating stranger rescued her and she discovered total physical awareness. And after one night of perfect seduction, Angela had a searing memory of the most phenomenal deflowering a girl ever had...It had been a setup. Angela's friends thought she needed a dark and dangerous fantasty man to sweep her off her feet, take control and awaken her sensuality. Corporal Vic Steadman had reluctantly agreed to the charade, never planning to go that far. But now he wanted more than one night - and the only way to make amends was to ""recapture"" Angela's virginity with a hands-off promise..."
1,No Longer Accurate,Rita's husband is not eligible for parole.His natural life sentence was reinstated by the Illinois Supreme Court.
4,"Awesome Character, Pretty Good Action Figure","This action figure looks awesome and the quality is very good. However, she is not very flexible. The box shows pictures of the figure in several poses that just aren't possible for her to do. The most she can do is stand there and look tough. But i would still recommend it to any collector or Final Fantasy fan!"
2,"""Meatless"" doesn't mean vegetarian","I received this book as a gift; otherwise I'd return it. I was stunned to find that the base for the vast majority of the ""Soups, Stews, and Chili"" is chicken or beef broth. The author adds a note that since the major part of the flavor comes from the beef or chicken broth she doesn't recommend using a veg. broth substitute. Ahem. I guess that the definition of ""Meatless""needs to be changed to accomodate an author who can't come up with a tasty vegetable broth."
1,Smart Vegetarians DON'T USE CHICKEN BROTH!,"True, the book is titled Meatless Dishes in Twenty Minutes, not Vegetarian Dishes in Twenty Minutes however, I found this book in a bookstore in the Vegetarian Cookbook section. I would never read this book, after seeing on page 9 that a recipe called for chicken or beef broth, I knew this author was full of crap.What can you expect from someone who also wrote Chicken Dishes in Twenty Minutes?"
5,Great Book (wacht out for bad spelling in this review),"When I bought this book I was still wondering if I would get my money's worth. After the 1st chapter I KNEW I had my money's worth. I like this book because one of my best friends has Down smydrome.And since she had this kids would tease her and when I told them to stop they would start to tese me unmearcifuly. So I have a first rate expriance at being teased.and I also rate this book 5 stars is because this book had adventure.One of the things I look for in a book.The only thing I would've changed is that you don't know what happens to her at the very end. Dose she and Tam get married or what? I think they would make a cute couple.:)But over all, I would recommend this book to anyone."
3,The cast-out child must find her own friends.,"This book is tricky; in the beginning it is slow, but has just enough excitement to keep you interested until later on Moql-Saaski meets one of her own kind. Then the book starts getting good."
1,I hated it!,"As I began this book, I was utterly confused. I was not sure of the child's location, or what was going on. After five pages I was so confused I just stopped reading. I read the entire book, and found that it was utterly boring. I do not recommend this book."
1,Impossible to stay interested...,"This book is about a nasty little changling girl and her adventures in a village. It's impossible to stay interested in the dull dragging plot and boring characters. I lost interest before I even read twenty pages. It was also utterly incomprehensible most of it I had no idea what was going on. Boring and impossible to understand, I hated this horrid book."
5,Heartwarming,"A book that shows life from another point of veiw. When an innocent half-elf and half-human is kicked out of her world, and given to the humans, she never really fits in anywhere. The story shows that, often people can be more horrible than that which they deem evil."
5,THIS BOOK IS A MUST-READ!,"I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read. I did this for a book report, and I ended up loving my book report. Now, I am having my mother buy this book for me. Read other books by McGraw if you liked this book."
5,BEST BOOK!,"I loved this book! After getting through the very beginning of the book, which is a little slow and confusing, the rest of the book is great. The plot picked up and became very exciting. The book is one big mystery and made me so curious I wanted to keep reading. The plot is full of supense. During the last part of the book I was on the edge of my seat. I love the characters because they are very different and unique. The author does a great job making fantasy seem real. After reading this book I wondered if faries and elves really exist. Read this book if you like fantasy!"
4,"Great book but sadly, not the author's best....By JW","This is a great book for those who feel like they don't quite belong. The reader follows the adventures and struggles of a girl named Saaski born half human and half magical creature. She faces triumphs and prejudice and she realizes that she doesn't really belong anywhere.After being raised by ""Folk"", Saaski is sent away to a human village where she is teased and humiliated by the other children. She befriends a boy who helps her get through the pain and who understands her because he too, is different. With the boy, memories that Saaski had pushed to the back of her mind start to come back to her in bits and pieces and she uses that information to do something really unexpected.This strange yet exciting story is the perfect book to read alone or with friends because there is a little bit of Saaski in all of us."
4,A great literature circle book! MM,I really enjoyed this book. It was a great book to read for literature circle in 6th grade. It was exciting and engaging. I enjoyed discussing this book with my friends.
4,A great fairy-tale fantasy...,"The story starts with a young girl named Moql'nkkn, who lives among the ""Folk"", a fairy like people. What Moql doesn't know is that she's only half-Folk. She finds it this out at the worse possible time- when she is supposed to disappear in front of a human. When she can't, she is brought to the ""Prince"" of the Folk, who decides she is to be exchanged for a human baby, which the Folk will use as a slave. Moql wakes up in a nearby village, and is called Saaski, her parents believing she is their human child, and the new little Saaski forgetting almost all of her old life. Saaski is hated by the villagers, who things she is a evil being. Her only true friend is Tam, a young boy who watches goats. The writing makes this book seem to come alive. The storyline will grip you and make you wonder what will happen next. Why Saaski find out who she truly is? Will the villagers harm her? And who are the small people she sometimes sees on her beloved moor?"
2,BAD SOUND QUALITY,"SOUND QUALITY RANGES FROM BAD, TO VERY BAD...DON'T ORDER THIS CD UNLESS YOU REALLY-REALLY WANT ANY OF THESE SONGS AND THEN ONLY IF YOU CAN'T FIND THEM ON ANY OTHER CD'S !"
3,no surprise here,"what can I say, aaron funk is continuously brilliant. This album is not ""the best"" but its most certainly not the worst either. thats why I gave it 3 stars. Its good, mid paced vsnares. and in its own way previews what he would later do with pom poms and hospitality.bottom line, you wont be let down unless this is your intro to vsnares, in which case go with meathole or higgins ultra low."
1,comparison to similar book,"two previous reviewers have the opinion that this book is inferior to the book by kandarpa. After carefully reviewing both books, I believe that this is an understatement. Also, I wonder if the long laudatory review could have been confabulated by the author himself. If so this reflects poorly on amazon.com.Finally, is the author a radiologist or a practicing radiologist?"
1,huh?,i read the other reviews and i'm wondering what book did they read? you get a felling that the author really doesn't perform interventional procedures. i would have to recommend a better book - kandarpa's handbook is much better!
3,Archie Moore and others should have never left Velocity Girl,"This album is good, due to Archie Moore's profound talent and soothing indie voice. However, I am not quite sure why the Heartworms brought back the orginial Velocity Girl Trisha Roy and left Sarah Shannon in the dust. When comparing the two Miss Roy doesn't hold a candle to the profound voice of Sarah. There must be a reason that Sarah replace Trisha in Velcity Girl in the first place! Archie Moore fails to recall the reason and here we have a reversion back to pre-historic times. The album would be better if it was just a solo album with Archie as lead vocalist. Why have a have a female singer if you could have just kept Velocity Girl together? And why replace Sarah with the girl you used Sarah to replace?"
4,Classic Collectible.,Both Cheetah items are really cool for collectors. It's not Mario Bros; but it's fun. Jumping is a little hard to do.
5,Cute Book!,"Smarty Jones' story is not told in this book. Instead, you hear what Smarty thinks about all he's done from his own humorous point of view. I laughed at his technique and small jokes that made the book so loveable. Although, of course, the book is not written by Smarty, I appreciate the author's attempt and, I have to say, did a good job of it. This book is nothing serious. Although at numerous points it tries to be. This book is delightful to all readers, despite your association with horses or not. I have to say, this is the only book that makes you think for a moment you're in school and should be paying close attention. So, before you read this book, make sure you take out a notebook and pencil, fore, as Smarty says, ""There will be a quiz at the end of the book"". His is a fun ride, a pleasing class. Have fun, everyone."
4,a light tribute to Chester Gould,"This book is for all fans of Chester Gould's original Dick Tracy. Kyle Baker's artistic interpretation of many, many of Chester Gould's villains is a nice treat. (None of the characters created after Chester gould's retirement are used--yay!) True, the characterizations are basically flat, but that is unfortunately to be expected in a story with such an extremely large cast. The book gives time to many characters who did not make it to the movie such as FBI agent Jim Trailer, the Mole, B-B Eyes, Jerome Trohs, and the mad Doc Hump. The color is fantastic. The book is enjoyable if it is read as a light tribute to Chester Gould and nothing more. The only thing that kept me from giving the book five stars is that Warren Beatty's face is used on the Dick Tracy character instead of the original square-jawed Chet Gould comic strip version, which I heard that Kyle Baker wanted to use until his superiors informed him, ""Warren Beatty IS Dick Tracy."" Get over yourself, Warren."
5,between god aand man,"this book goes deeply into the Jewish concept of prayer, awareness , and intimacy withThe book gave wonderful concept of the spirituality and theology of the Jewish faith as derived from the Oldtestament without delving into the enrichments of Christ and the New Testament.The prophets bring one right into the NEW. The book has given me a greater appreciation of the bible and binds both Old and the New as one.It was the spiritual concept of God in the Old Testament times. It was fascinating to learn of God using just the scriptures and theology of the Old Testament. The approach to God by the prophets, in anticipation of what Jesus Christ would bring in the New Testament to mankind, gives a wonderful of the Bible as a whole and the part that the Jewish faith plays in Christianity ."
5,An excellent resource,"This book is like having access to a good friend who knows VB inside and out.The size and format of this book make it so much more inviting to use and keep around than your normal 500 page exploratory into VB that the majority of books seem to lean towards today.The topics covered are comprehensive without being overly detailed. The use of pictures and grahics to illustrate points is done with taste and functional minimalism.The book assumes you understand VB and are looking for clear explanations of features (basic through advanced) without having to go through pages and pages of help files.Topics covered include syntactic features, coding conventions, OO, IIS and Web Apps, DAO/RDO/ADO, MTS and COM and bunch more.I wish Sams would produce the equivalent handbook style publications for Visual C++ and Java."
4,Finally - one worth buying.,Gets right to it. Doesn't lead you through the filler crud most VB books do. Useful content of this book is around 50% or so. Most VB books are about 10% to 18%.
3,"Close, but no cigar!","My almost two year old son overall loves this toy, but almost cries with frustration when the phone disconnects from the toy. The string that attaches the phone to the toy always disconnects. It's very annoying to have to constantly re-attach it. I'm thinking super glue..."
1,Waste of time and money,Awful. I feel asleep after twenty minutes. This did not seem like a good idea to begin with. Started of way too slow and just sucked in general.
1,"Terrible, terrible movie","This was so bad I couldn't finish it. I had to turn it off and I rarely do that with a movie I pay to watch. On paper it sounded good. In reality, not so much."
3,Hobe Labs Sweet Almond Oil,"Although the product arrive as scheduled, I thought the product would have the fragrance of the sweet smelling almond oil. Will not repurchase."
1,Unpleasant book,"Well, I like adventure books and I like storys about aircraft and airports and so on. But this book is bad because somehow the people are all very single-sided and strange. Additionally the author attempts to teach the reader good manners and that I hate if it happens every second page in an adventure story. Finally the hero and antihero can not catch the fellings of the reader because they betray their claimed cause and act purely selfish and dumb."
2,Gave up after a hundred pages - story did not move enough.,"I started this book in anticipation of a great read, but was sorely disappointed. After about a hundred pages, we had a ""hijacked"" plane, the FBI and other law enforcement was getting organized to find out who was behind it and why, and...that's it. I love a good thriller, but this one simply could not keep my interest. I'm in the minority among the reviewers, but I've read other authors who kept the pace moving far better."
2,Needs A Rewrite,"Could have been a much better story if not for the constant repetition and flat dialog. There is a good plot here, but it gets buried. It will probably make a good TV movie of the week if the author allows a screenwriter to trim it down a bit."
4,"pretty good, lean and mean","you'll read this one so quick you will think you're speed reading! nice surprises, and keeps moving along. Another good airliner in distress book is MAYDAY. For the real stuff check out Macarthur Job's Air Disaster Books wedged in the transportation section of your bookstore. These are fascinating. FASCINATING!! You'll thank me later!!"
2,Story is contrived & fails to elicit sympathy from reader.,"From the time the Captain heads into the lavatory when he realized Bostich was aboard, reader is aware that he (Captain) could have no bomb, so why did it take the astute FBI agent so long to figure that one out? Were we to assume Wolfe just flew around have-bomb-will-hijack just in case he ran into Bostich? Couldn't work up any sympathy for Wolfe since he was in the process of terrifying people to satisfy his own needs - the ends justify the means type of scenario. Characters didn't ring true. Nance seemed to be trying to pattern his female FBI agent after the one in Silence of the Lambs, came far short. I stuck with it to the end, could have read something better. Won't recommend it to anyone."
4,Pretty Good,"I thought this book was pretty interesting. It's not one of my all-time favorites, but I think it's one of Nance's better work. A little wordy at times, but it fits into the white-knuckle aviation conflict genre quite well."
4,Rapid fun.,"A commercial airliner is hijacked after an emergency landing. FBI Agent Kat Bronsky is on location and assigned as negotiator, after it is forced to take off almost immediately with the copilot and one other passenger left on the tarmac. But, some of the hijackers actions and demands don't seem to fit together, and a puzzled Bronsky keeps examining different scenarios looking for a key. Now the picture that has appeared is even worse than when she started, because it appears that the pilot is not responding to a demented hijacker. It now seems the Airline Pilot alone has decided that his only tools to correct an evil injustice, are a planeload of hostages, a bomb and a deadman trigger.Interestingly, Nance keeps dragging the characters higher and higher up the food chain while following the trail of a horrible murder."
1,Keep your enemies even closer........,"If you like well-tuned spacy pop you'll love this record. The follow up to this EP, During (full-length) is pretty close to being a masterpiece."
3,Pretty good as far as it goes,"I found the combination of interweaving comments from an attorney and a psychologist to be very effective and was very encouraged as I began reading. As I progressed, however, I became somewhat disappointed for several different reasons and these reasons may not apply to other people (so take my rating with a grain of salt). First, a huge proportion of the book is dedicated to issues of childcare and child custody so for those of us without children, it's as if we bought a book that only has 60% of its content directed towards us. In this light, I thought that some of the financial issues were shortchanged a bit. Second, it seemed like a disproportionate amount of the material was directed specifically (or at least primarily) towards wives. Finally, I would have liked to have seen more attention paid to situations where there may be substantial issues of emotional problems and/or mental illness. Those exceptions aside, though, I thought this was a very well-done book."
5,The only divorce book you need,"A friend gave me this book as a ""divorce present"", and it's been a big help. Everything's in there, from every detail on the legal procedure to how to work out a schedule for child custody, given how old your child is. I can't believe it. I've read a couple of other divorce books, and none was this complete. Good internet resources section and model divorce agreement in the back. I was surprised at how well the authors guessed at what my wife and I would be fighting about, and a couple of the tips have actually worked. It also suggested we try mediation, which we've signed up for."
3,For those contemplating tying the knot,"I noticed how natural it is for many to play devil's advocate to big ideas and plans. This book can help bulletproof those contemplating marraige. The time to think about the mountain of details and work of undoing a union is before the union is entered into. Anybody in such circumstance wanting advice would do better to get it from the experts, the authors."
3,Rehash of the same found everywhere else,"I didn't find this book to be incredibly helpful, as (a) I have no children, and (b) I technically make more money than my X2B does. I was hoping for some insights on how to come out of the divorce as best I can, but didn't see anything new here. If you don't have any kids, let me summarize what you'll get from these books: Pay attention to retirement plans/401Ks, make sure you have enough liquid assets to make it through the next several years (vs. settling for high value non-liquid assets only), and recognize that divorce is hard!Personally, I found phone interviews with divorce attorneys to be the most helpful source of information. Good luck!"
4,Practical divorce advice,"Interesting book coming from both the perspective of the divorce lawyer and a psychologist. Some good, solid advice here. While going through a divorce you should gather as much information as possible and know how to protect yourself both emotionally and financially.Seven Secrets to a Successful Divorce"
4,Great photos,The book shows the different types of dolls telling the country they are from and a brief history of each.I would have preferred a little bit of instruction on how to make some of them.
5,The True Vine --- My life,The truths found in the short book can truly change lives. To see the eternal connection of the Vine to the branch and the two fold eternal purpose was both challenging and encouraging. If only more followers of Christ could grab hold of these truths. Highly recommend to anyone seeking a deeper walk with Christ.
1,Useless for running....,I have tried each and every attachment and these headphones will not stay in my ears even for the first few steps of my run. The sound quality is fine but even sitting still I found them quite uncomfortable.Do not buy these if you are looking for headphones to wear while you run/work-out. They will drive you crazy!
4,Helms post rock style,"Helms second album ""McCarthy"" which was named after the band's vocalist last name is an album stuffed with intensity, sadness, darkness, with experimental rock aspects to the music. Slint is a band that will always loom over Helms because of the obvious influence it had on band's sound. The vocalist Sean McCarthy does a mix of sing/speak vocals much like Slint's Brian McMahon did. The music itself is post rock in the vien of Slint, Rodan, June of 44, and Sonic Youth. Some of the songs lurch along slowly like rush hour traffic, but generally come to dramatic climaxes breaking away from the song's orignal blueprint.Highly recommended if you like: Slint, Rodan, June of 44, and Sonic Youth."
2,Misleading Cover Photo,"Don't be mislead by the advertized cover photo. You won't find it in this book. There are a few poorly reproduced photos of Roberta Pedon, but not worth the purchase price of this book. The small amount of info on this model is inaccurate and almost seems ficticious. If your not buying the book for the cover model, the book covers a large variety of men's magazine with a very small percent of the Big Bust genre. I hope this helps."
1,Do Not Buy for Long Term,"I have had this for a about seven years so far. I have no problems with the red dot function itself, it is the material I do not like. The rubber-type coating on the scope has deteriorated (or more like melted) to a state where it feels like you're touching spray paint that has not fully dried. A black residue rubs off on anything the scope touches. It worked fine for a few years but is now worthless."
2,700 spring bars watch band,Way too expensive for what the product is - found at half the price at other locations. Feel cheated!
1,HOW CAN THEY REALLY USE THIS ????????,THISIS THE MOST JUNK ITEM I EVER BOOUGHT FOR DOGITS PURE PLASTIC AND NOT FOR TEETH BIG OR SMALL DOGS WOULD NOT HAVE TEETH AFTER YOU EVEN COULD USE THIS --HE LOOKED AT IT SMELLED IT AND ITS STILL LAYING IN THE SAME PLACE OHHH WHAT A WASTE OF GOOD MONEY
3,Not bad.,"I""ve now had this bell multi-tool for 3 years. It's worked ok, but I don't carry it anymore. It's pretty hefty and a bit cumbersome to use. My seat wedge is on the small side and tool took up too much space to get a tube in there. The single tire lever is ok for my mountain bike, but useless on my road bike. In contrast, my little ratcheting Dakine snowboarding tool has a bit and a tiny wrench that works on every nut/bolt/screw on my bike, so I carry that 99% of the time anymore.The socket head design is clever. I""ll probably give mine to my wife since her bike has more need for the sockets. My bike doesn't need them at all.They're inexpensive and sold along with inexpensive bikes, so it's worth having something.. but it's not the best tool out there by any means even given the price. I think my Dakine was under $10."
5,Perfect for a small bike bag,"This is a very solid tool with good features, one of which is the size--perfect for an under-seat bike bag."
2,Too heavy to carry,"The Bell Quick-Tool is very heavy and very wide, so it's hard to hold when using the allen wrenches. It has one tire iron...a metal one...I need two, and use the nylon ones that can clip to the spoke so your hands are free for the second one. Having a single tire iron seems like a marketing thing not something a cyclist would want by the side of the road.I've got better designed multi tools. This one was for my wife and it was overkill."
4,sweet love story,"I enjoyed this book. It has a tender love story that slowly unfurls between the two characters. Both of them had their own issues, but the story had them come together in a nice way. It was a homey, cozy read."
5,Del Putas,Lo mas poderoso del DEATH METAL EN ESPA√ëOL!!! Aunque dudo mucho que la gente que habla ingles entienda su verdadero significado en sus liricas... con el sonido potente y demodelor es mas que sufuciente. Si les gusta este ultimo album ... creo que seria bueno que compraran los anteriores > RAZA ODIADA Y MATANDO GUEROS!. Por otra parte hay canciones parodias (disque cover) que son bakanisimas llamadas Don Quijote Marijuana y Marijuana!
4,85% Great!,Some songs are just to much noise hahah I know I sound like a granny.But 85% of this album still kicks major A****ss!
1,cover makes battery useless,"I ordered this product thinking from other reviews, the battery cover for this larger battery was just flimsy. The cover just plain doesn't fit. Period. You can not use this battery unless you already have an OEM factory cover for this larger type battery for the Sanyo scp 8400 phone. The cover is made of plastic most resembling packaging material. As a result, I can not use this battery."
2,no response from customer service,the battery works great. The company never replied to emails for a better battery cover
3,"Great film, bad encoding.","Seriously, I don't know what Home Vision did to this film, as it is the dvd image renders it almost unwatchable. There's just too much combing (when a progressive image is made out of an interlaced one and the image gets ""videodromey"" whenever there's more movement onscreen).Being a movie about children, every time they would go out to play and dance around the school, there was some crazy ""The Ring""-like effect because of the bad encoding, I thought the children where getting out of the TV to kill me, completely took me out of the story."
4,The forest of broken dreams!,"The great Robert Bresson always regreted the films had to be accompained by words. He regarded them useless, since the cinema is strictly a visual art.I bring up this previous comment, because Innocence is a film that easily could do without the words. The visuals talk by themselves, the beauty of nature confronted with the isolation from the outer world around these little girls who are forced to abandon their team once they reach 12, with a violet ribbon on her hair.Its intimate style prefigures a minimalist portrait about the dreams, hopes and vanished illusions of this bunch of little girls who are brought up without feelings under the most strict rules of obedience and severe discipline.The final is opened, leaving it to us to judge and meditate. Superb photography despite its slow paced rhtym.Marion Cotillard once more chews the scenery."
1,Video Quality is Terrible,I didn't make very far into this film - either the encoding is absolutely off or it was filmed with a cheap DV camera. There's some strange video (de-?)interlacing/combining going on that creates a horrible jerky blur around any movement. The reviewer who said it renders the movie unwatchable is right. What looked to be an interesting movie was completely ruined by shoddy image quality.
5,Pop to brighten your day.,"I happened across a United States Three show in Chicago last year. I loved the band and purchased this record. Le temps de tempo quickly became one of my all time favorites. I listen to it almost everyday. If you like pop music you'll love this. le temps du tempo is also an amazing ""headphone"" record -- there is some crazy stuff buried in there if you listen closely. If you like the Goo Goo dolls, Sloan, Velvet Underground, then you need to add this to your collection."
4,Solid Ninth Entry in Series,Very solid ninth entry effectively mixes Charlie Resnick's ever-deepening relationship with schoolteacher Hannah and the dissapearance of her friend Jane. This is against a backdrop of the formation of a new Serious Crimes Unit headed by an ambitious high-flying female which threatens to take over Charlie's turf. Less effective is the subplot tying together a few formerly seen characters and an art forgery ring.
1,Disappointingly Little Content,"I bought this book with the hope that it would help me figure out a slightly more complex than average home wireless setup. The book is extremely thin, with most of the content being a walkthrough of various screens in windows to configure the client portion of a wireless network.Very little attention is given to how to configure a house with a DSL connection and wireless networking internally. There was no useful information at all on the setup I would like to create, which would have one DSL line but multiple wireless zones in the house.This book may be useful for those who have absolutely no knowledge of wireless networks, but for anyone beyond that level I would not waste the time or money on it."
5,"Helpful, practical -- and takes the long view.","If you are looking for a book to help you with the pragmatics of setting up a 802.11b (wi-fi) wireless network in your home or office, this book is filled with information. The installation tips saved me alot of time, and the chapter on Security was very helpful. I also liked the big picture material included by the authors, such as case studies and interviews with people who are wireless gurus."
1,disapointed in the movie,the quality of the dvd was bad it had lines through the picture. I recorded it off our tv and the quality was alot better than the dvd
3,Interesting but a little outdated,"I knew the book was ten years old when I bought it but still expected it to have rather more practical information that it does. It should really be called 'Book Related Jobs' since several of the suggestions - translating, editing and proofreading, for example - can only be carried out by trained professionals and this book is meant to be aimed at the the general book lover who wants to make a little money from the hobby, if possible. And including 'How to become a published author' as one of the chapters is definitely digressing from the book's title. However, on the plus side the book gives a good introduction to the layperson of what's involved in writing and publishing a book. It was well researched and includes concise and useful advice on setting up a business and marketing yourself.It would be great to see a new edition of this book taking into account the Internet age as much of the current edition's content is outdated."
2,Needs to be updated,My curousity got the better of me when I bought this book. Thats one problem when you buy online you can't pick it up and flip thru or in this case you could not take a look inside. So I bought it and upon receiving it I was disappointed. When the book was written it was probably great however that was a while back. So its not for today or needs updating things have change so much especially with media and books.
2,"Show, don't tell!","In fairness, I would have given a 2.5 rating if that were available. Admittedly, this is a reasonably priced book, so one doesn't lose much by giving it a try. My problem with it, is that it is heavy on the ""tell"" and not very good at the ""show."" While the embroidery stitches are explained with (very basic) line drawings, the actual flower designs are described in writing with no sequential drawings. This leaves the reader flipping back and forth between the earlier ""stitch glossary"" pages trying to work out how each flower is made. The book is probably fine for a more advanced hobbyist who is mainly interested in the iron-on transfer patterns. I would not recommend it to a beginner or to someone who has no knowledge of basic three-dimensional embroidery stitches."
3,Looked better than it actually was...,"Got excited about this one when I saw it, but found the designs WAAAAY to intricate. This may be a matter of taste, or the nature of Brazilian embroidery, but the book is definitely full of very similar-looking designs. It just wasn't what I was looking for in transfer patterns."
4,Instructional Booklet,Very precise instructions on this difficult embroidery procedure. Beautiful patterns included and illustrated. Would recommend this book to anyone wanting to begin doing this kind of crafting.
4,Brazilian Three- Dimensional Embroidery,Love the book. Received it in allotted time frame. I can't wait to start embroidering three dimensional. It looks real fun.
2,Brazilian Three-Dimensional Embroidery,I have not tried the patterns or instructions in this book. I collected it to place in my hobby library and look forward to studying it at a future date. S. Robertson
5,just what I wanted,I came across this book on a coffee table and started marking pages I wanted to try. When I got to the 5th or 6th marked page I decided I need to own this book!
2,Outdated,"I found the recipes and methods to be outdated, and many were not recipes my family would eat. Since I had bought my copy used, I ended up just cutting out the 5 recipes out of the entire book that I would possibly try, and recycling the rest of the book."
5,Lws Paul & Mary Ford,"After having seen a 90 minute documentary on Les Paul & Mary Ford and having listened to their music I sought CD's that carried all their music. I was rewarded with 5 albums that bright back memories of great guitar music and singing synchronized to that guitar. All albums are great and I would give them 5 stars for sound, style, singing and good enjoyable listening."
5,Sunex Deep Sockets,"I ordered and received 11 heavy duty deep impact sockets made by Sunex in 3/4 drive in both metric and uss sizes above an inch. I was somewhat skeptical as I have always purchased Craftsmen Sockets. While I have yet to use these new sockets, I was really impressed by their construction and apparent durability. They are just like they looked like in the illustration with deep wells for recessed bolts or nuts on long bolts and the walls are thick."
2,Enduro movie,"The video quality isn't very good;neither is the narration. It's on the dry and boring side. This isn't an instructional video, but an off-road motorcyclist will learn some by watching this. Watch this only with an interest in motorcycling history."
2,Varon Dandy,use it in the 70'swas very goodtoday is as much alcohol as colonybut I still likeperhaps nostalgia
1,Buyers Beware-dimension not as advertised.,"The Bargman 34-50-111 #100 Replacement Lens does not measure 2 3/8"" in diameter as advertised. They measure 2 5/16"" overall diameter. These will not fit my existing clearance light base which is 2 3/8"". The quality of the product is ""Bargman"" good as expected, just won't fit."
1,"Saxophone pin arrives on a ""sour note""","I was very disappointed with my purchase upon arrival. The shaft of the pin was bent at an angle that would not allow the back to be removed. Due to the inexpensive cost of the pin, I did not return it as the return postage would be more than the cost of the pin. The front of the pin was nice."
3,Savoy Brown-'Live At The Record Plant' (Archive Alive),"This gig was recorded live at The Record Plant Studio in NYC in late 1975 in front of a select crowd.It's line-up can boast of one original member,founder/guitarist Kim Simmonds and long-time keyboardist/vocalist Paul Raymond.Like Uriah Heep and Wishbone Ash,between myself and fellow music fans,Savoy Brown has always been considered to be a fine underground band.Out of the seven tracks here,the Savoy really showcases plenty of somewhat brilliant playing on ""Hellbound Train"" and ""Savoy Brown Boogie"".Also dug ""Tell Mama"" and their cover of an old blues standard ""You Don't Have To Go"".Simmons was noted for wanting THIS version of the band to display more emphasis on his guitar playing.That mission was accomplished."
2,the subtitle tells the tale,"This book is an academically fashionable discussion of the notion of ""man of science"" (a self-identification chronologically intermediate between ""natural philosopher"" and ""scientist""). Its title should have been: ""Making the 'Man of Science': the case of Thomas Huxley"". White is much more interested in the notions of ""making"" and ""man"" than in ""science"". He hopes to show how that occupation was ""constructed"" -- consciously, in his view -- by its practitioners. For example, he argues that the practitioners of science modeled their research practice on the solitary domestic sphere, thus raising questions about the ""gendering"" of ""man"". The author has done a prodigious amount of research. He covers a lot of territory and his bibliography is very valuable. But we learn more about academic fashion -- and jargon -- than about Huxley."
3,Spenser for Hire,"I really enjoy the incarnations of Robert Parker's characters as brought to life by Robert Urich and Avery Brooks. My only disappointment was that the woman who played Susan Silverman in the television show was not there; otherwise, I really enjoyed the movies."
2,Lame Movie,"Having read virtually all of the Spenser novels, I was really looking forward to this movie. What a disappointment! It was just LAME! Maybe it's just my imagination, but none of these actors came even close to matching what I expected. I wouldn't even call this a ""B"" movie adaption of the books, but maybe a ""D"" version."
4,POLORIS SNOCROSS,"This game is very fun because you need practice with the controls and it takes time to get good at some of the levels. This game is a racing game but for snowmobiles. If you like snowmobiles you will probobly like this game. It is much like some other racing games but there is always a level that takes some time to beat. I think, overall this game is very fun and exciting for the snowmobile lover."
3,Cute but. . . . .,A little overpriced for something that you tweener won't spend much time with. Cute & well made though. Depends on what you are expecting.
1,Does not worth,"Half of the book contains empty papers. What the use of it then. I hate this book, nothing special to learn and no techniques for training. Its a waste of money."
2,High and Dry,"The Gentleman's Guide to Toasting, while light-hearted and well-written, doesn't deliver the valuable instruction that one might expect from its title. The ""Guide"" is more of a loose set of otherwise obvious info: be creative, be witty, be brief...In any case, the ""Guide"" part of the book is only 4.5 pages long. The majority of the book's volume is dedicated to a list of example toasts, divided by occasion, which are more poems and quotes than they are toasts.These shortcomings aside, the main reason for the low rating is that this book's pages are littered with advertisements for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which (in my humble opinion) have little bearing on the act of toasting.The illustrations are cute and the writing is clever, but I find myself disappointed overall."
1,Let's be clear - This is just ONE speaker,"I also assumed this was a pair of speakers. There are, after all, 2 speakers shown in the picture. Besides, this is how Klipsch (and other) stereo speakers are normally sold.I am sure the quality of the Klipsch speaker itself is great. It is the misrepresentation that gets a 1 star rating."
5,Fantastic Survey of Jazz,"Is there any other book that is as true as this book, when recalling the intricate history of jazz? If there is, it has escaped my eyes and i invite the opurtunity to read it. Ted Gioia is not only articulate in his representation of jazz history, but his facts are documented well above reproach. He even includes a suggested listening section at the back of the book. Incredible book! I am using it as an aid in teaching my highschool class the history of jazz. This book is a necessary investment for any jazz afficianado."
4,Fills in Most Burns Blanks,"This book is a perfect compliment to Ken Burns Jazz in most respects. Gioia's writing is lucid and descriptive. He seamlessly weaves social analysis with musical analysis. Anecdotes about jazz personalities abound. Some feel that he gives too much attention and credit to Charlie Parker. As a Parker admirer, I'd say the more the merrier. My only regret is that way too many 80's and 90's artists are conspicuously absent. Look at the impact, for example that the Jazz Crusaders (Joe Sample and Larry Carlton) Yellowjackets (Russell Ferrante and Jimmy Haslip) Dave Grusin, Bob James and David Benoit have had fusing Post Modern and Traditional elements (a very different result than the ""fusion"" of the early to late 70's). Ted was either disinterested or unable to connect these nuances to the larger scope of the history. Otherwise, to round out the Ken Burns version of the Jazz story, read this and fill in most of the blanks."
4,Must-Have History,"An outstanding journey through the history of jazz. It is lacking in the area of Brazilian music's incredible influence on jazz in the last 40 years; for that one should also consult ""The Brazilian Sound"" (Temple University Press)."
1,BOOORING!!!,"I don't question that this book covers complete history of jazz. I don't question that author is competent, actually super-competent. I don't question that this book is great. But reading this book is as much fun as reading Webster's Collegiate Dictionary or telephone directory. It is BORING, actually, super-boring. I gave up after 20 pages...If you are looking for scientific dissertation about history of jazz, this is The One. If you are looking for a book for someone that knows nothing about jazz and wants some fun, go elsewhere."
3,more jazz,"my interst is in buyng dvd in ntsc about jazz orch, singers , big band's -40's 5o's such as benny goodmsan, artie shaw. count basie ,les paul, dinah washington, ell fitz , diana shore etc"
2,Extremely dull,"This was used as a supplement to a jazz history class for non-music majors I took over a summer semester. The textbook takes the same approach as the class, developing jazz from it's roots in the mid 1800's, and progresses it through the various developments of the last couple centuries. Fundamentally though, this is a problematic idea without taking a musical approach. As the text avoids theory in nearly all of it's forms, the text defends into a plain list of names with short anecdotes from their lives. The importance of any one figure is only gauged by the length of their section in the text, and the same phrases are used to describe nearly every individual.If you need this book for a class reading it will help with the memorization, but if you're a casual reader find another book tailored more closely to the specifics of what you'd like to learn/read."
5,Enjoyably unsettling,"There's much to admire about this understated novel. I like the way Howell plays with the different narratives, but I especially like the way that none of his narrators has the faintest idea of what's going on - all the knowledge is with the other characters, and therefore readers have to scavenge about and glean what they can. All of Howell's fiction is unsettling, and the narrators' bafflement is what makes this book an enjoyably unsettling read. While the structure implies metafictional reflections about truth, realism and copying, I was more drawn in by the small touches. I was very interested in the women characters, for example, and loved the idea of them being pinned down in the pictures - all that kind of stuff is great.I think it's a most accomplished first novel, obviously well written and researched but not flashy despite the postmodern apparatus."
5,Satisfied,Product was recieved promptly and in excellent condition. Would not hesitate to order from them again.
4,"good machine, bad instructions","The base metal part came in a little crooked. Doesn't bother me at this point, but long term might affect the machine.The instructions are incorrect. The very first step show L-shaped part which is a little different from what it really is. There are 2 triangular platters which are never mentioned in the instructions and have to be attached to the L-shaped part and the other part specified in 1st step. I realized that towards the end of the assembly, so had to dis-assemble and reattach those platters.The machine however is good for what it's supposed to be used for."
3,"Just 10 Hits, Not All Original; See My Track List","Track List Including Artists and Whether Original Hit:1. I Walk the Line - Johnny Cash (original)2. Mama Tried - Merle Haggard (original)3.

1,Where is the rest of the system?,"Bought this item to relay wind/speed/direction - but - unless you already have the rest of the system, it is worthless. No indication of needing to buy the rest to make it work in the information listed - be careful."
3,Replacement wind sensor,"Wind sensor failed after 2 years on original WS-2308. It was a guess as to whether it was the sensor or the transmit unit. There is no apparent way to isolate the two. Lacrosse Tech. Co. was absolutely no help as their service gets a zero rating. However the replacement unit, the company ordered from, and Amazon fulfilled their commitment properly. This problem was fixed. It appears from discussion with others that the three main makers of home weather stations all have poor service, and products that eventually fail. This is what you get for the price point - weather stations that do not handle the weather very well!"
5,Lacrosse Wind Sensor Replacement,"Original failed after about 3-4 years of use. The symptoms were no data received at the panel and no data logged in Heavy Weather or any other weather app. Although it was a gamble whether this was the problem or the main panel, I guessed that this component sees more action and weather than the panel and took a chnace that this may fix the problem. It did indeed fix the problem. The weather station is completely back to normal now.Unfortunately, I still do not know a way to definitively diagnose the failure in the future. (How to test this sensor) But I will be less reluctant to take a chance on this component."
4,Performs just like original,"It works like the original because it is an exact replacement (from Delco) and about half the price the GM dealer wanted. If your car is like mine, it will need a new small hose (1/8"" ID 6"" long). I fashioned a replacement out of bulk hose instead of ordering the special factory one with the connectors included. You can reuse the old connectors."
2,Noisy,Extremely noisy. It's like running a leaf blower inside your house. I returned it. Probably good for drying a large dog outside but not good for a cat.
1,LOUD,This dryer is insanely loud. It scares the dogs and I can not hear anything over it. It is difficult to attach to a cage and does not do a good job drying all of the dog because the cage dryer attachment is so small. I wish I did not buy this.
3,instructions not clear,"There is a knob on the bottom of unit, no explanation. They wrote about a air selector on hose which doesn't exist. No pictures of anything except the inside of fan. Does not explain or show how to clip cage blower attachment to cage. Really good item lacks instructions that can followed, however they did include a long list of replacment part item numbers!!!!!"
4,Not bad power for the size,A good portable option when you need quick touch ups at shows or you have smaller dogs that could be blown off the table with more powerful dryers. Most of the time I use it without the dryer attachment and it is light enough to hand hold with one hand while drying with the other. Metro is a brand well respected and with a proven product line.
3,Fair at best,I was looking fir something to clean my wife's ring. The jewelry store recommended not using steam at home so I tried this. Not very impressed with it's ability to remove grease and dirt from the underside of the stone.
3,"Interesting subject, but could have been 150 pages shorter--","A very interesting subject - someone who knows how to get what he wants financially, but is, even today, apparently a miserable little guy. The author could have shortened the story a little. His writing is somewhat flat at times, and when he presents the chronology of a business deal, he loses his touch. But overall, if one wants to learn how Hollywood works (and screws around while it should be working) this is an interesting tome."
3,Geffen would be pleased,"When first published, there were stories about this book in the national media which seemed to indicate David Geffen was trying to block publication. Well, it turns out, the book is mostly quite complimentary. There may be a few minor embarassments here and there, like the story of his relationship with Lauro Nyro, who led him around Central Park on a leash, but Geffen is shown to be a smart if sometimes ruthless business man. There are alot of great stories here, like the birth of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young who barely finished their album before they decided they hated each other. Or the Eagles, another superband full of enemies and infighting. There is more dope here about the music business than about the movies. We'll have to wait for another book to give us the juice about Dreamworks and Steven Speilberg."
4,"The Operator : David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New","Great book. Real interesting read. If you are interested in Hollywood and the personalities behind Hollywood this is the 1 book you cannont miss. Tom King maintains interest and portrays the inner workings of now, a Hollywood legend!"
3,What a Whining Little Pisher,"In a well documented and relatively well thought out book Tom King paints a varied picture of David Geffen. Geffen is presented as being alternately brilliant and visionary, and then in a flash he becomes a whining, manipulative and cruel little pisher. King does a good job of presenting Geffen in all his many forms and incarnations. In the end, the question becomes, does anything Geffen has done in the past or might do in the future interst you as the reader. If the answer is ""yes"", then this book is a well thought out biography about a very hard to like little man. If the answer is ""no"", then you can safely save your money and you will not have missed anything. Overall I liked this book but grew to really dislike and not care about its subject."
4,Readable,"I actually enjoyed this biography quite a bit. It surprised me somewhat to learn how aggressive and cunning Geffen was. The back stabbings and lies are all part of the reason for Geffen's success but I still admire his ambition to get to the top. Overall a well balanced biography that, in some cases, doesn't go into enough detail. Overall, I find Mr. Kings writing style quite smooth and easy to read. Recommeded."
4,Couldn't help but like the guy,"I think this is a fairly unbiased work and deserves to be read by anyone interested in the entertainment busines. Even though I detested the character presented in the book, I couldn't help but like and admire him at the same time. No person is either all good or all bad, and I think the author tried to convey this point, to the best of his knowledge."
2,Poorly Written Book,"As a fan of David Geffen's success in the entertainment industry, i was more than excited to get a copy of the first authorized biography about his amazing life. However, i was disappointed. While it appears that writer Tom King thoroughly researched the man and his life, it was mostly dull and uninteresting, with little direction. The one good point of the book is that it truly shows that money doesn't buy happiness...for it seems Mr. Geffen still has his crosses to bear and remains totally unhappy even with his enormous riches and celebrity pals. I recommend a book called ""The Rise and Rise of David Geffen"" instead of this one."
1,King's writing is cheesy,"If you want to know more about the enigmatic, fascinating David Geffen, don't read this book. I learned much more from previous profiles in magazines that were much better written than this oversized smear book masquerading as a ""serious biography."" In addition to the fact that the tone is mocking, mean-spirited, whiny, gossipy and catty, it is riddled with cliche's. King claims that Geffen is the main source for many of his stories about him yet the fact that King didn't have the decency to even mention Geffen in his two pages of acknowledgements is appalling. I hope a real biographer will one day offer some insights into the drive that has taken Geffen to the top. In the meantime, skip this one."
3,Someone we shouldn't aspire to be,"I just finished this cut and paste book and wish the author King spent more time on more important issues than on the countless pages of nonsense. I understand he had limited time with Geffen but if you plan on writing a bio, do it right or not at all. Big deal, he made a billion dollars and is gay. He seems to be a miserable insecure person. David you made the money, we all applaud you. Now what? Another movie studio, another company, a kingdom, maybe?ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ! Give away most of your money and do something to make a difference in the world. I bet you'd feel a lot happier. Billionaire wannabees learn from his mistakes."
3,"Lots of anecdotes, little depth.","You have to wonder how a reporter...from The Wall Street Journal, no less, can be so adept at cliche slinging and say so little about character and motivation in so many pages. If you read this book, you'll read it because you already know a little about Geffen and are curious as to how he got where he is. You'll find out about the ""how"", but you won't find out about the ""why"". You'll read about Geffen's clever and frequently dishonest deal making, but you won't know why he was compelled , or driven, to do what he did. Instead of providing some analysis of this type, the author seems more concerned in employing cliches such as ""catapulted to...."" or ""rocketed to..."" or ""shot up the list...."" etc. etc... on to the point of annoyance. This is a complex story that should not have been told so simply and, in fact, patronizingly. It gets three stars from me only because it does supply the details. But it annoyed me while I was getting them."
2,A collection of categories,"Of the 4 books I purchased on this subject, this was the leasthelpful. It was little more than one professional's way ofclassifying adulterers with fairly superficial explanations of their behaviors, what lead to their affairs, and how to deal with them. I bought it for my husband, but I don't think it'sworth his time. There are better books out there."
1,This Book is Dull,"Don't bother reading this entire book. That's what I tried to do and I gave up at the end of the first chapter. If you still believe you'll find something insightful in this book, here's what you do:Read chapter 12 which summarizes several types of men who have affairs. When you come across a specific type of cheater, go to that chapter and read about it. I'm warning you: this book is boring and not that informative. And I don't understand how any woman could not have any type of clue that her husband had been cheating on her for four years. Denial is definetly not a river in Egypt."
5,Nice shaver,"I thought at first that this ice shaver was too expensive, but it seems you get what you pay for. I had a hand crank ice shaver, and after I used that, I hardly ever used it again because it was difficult to shave the ice. That was a waste of money. This one is so easy, and takes ice cubes. (don't ever get an ice maker that makes you freeze ice in their funny shaped containers) I'm very please with the ease of use, and the nice soft shaved ice that comes out. We use it often enough that I can't make ice fast enough. I don't think I will ever look at shaved ice in carnivals the same way again."
4,Kid Friendly Operation!!,This has been a great addition to our appliances! The kids can easily use it to help themselves to a no cholesterol treat after school or playing outside on a hot day. The flavor packets are easy to mix and are just as good as the local stand!
5,Simple and hard worker,"Very good Snow maker. It works perfectly and easy to use and clean.Just if I could desire something else to this perfect machine, maybe a 110/220V converter would be very useful, to be used anywhere in the world.Excellent purchase, Thanks Amazon!"
