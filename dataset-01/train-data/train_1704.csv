5,Unforgettable show,"Especialy for all polish fans (i am one of them...).What more can i say - all songs are groovier and more harder than studio versions and also ""rocking in the free world"" (Neill young's cover) is wonderfull...Eddie vedder is fantastic frotman - his stories telled to the audience are funny and really charming - he is not a star, he is just a normal nice man who just sings and plays in such a famous rock band.....Fantastic show!!!!"
5,One of Chicago's Best,"I personally believe that ""Through The Open Door"" is an original work that greatly showcases the talents of Chicago Jazz Guitarist John Moulder. This work brilliantly displays a great facet of his talent. Furthermore, it presents the shere creativity and inovation in his style of Jazz performance."
1,If only the ink were as colourful as the packaging,"If you plan to print colour, read this very carefully before buying this ink: the colours do not match what you see on the screen - not even close. The colours lack saturation, they tend to have a hue. If you're printing a lot and it doesn't matter what your prints look like, fine. But if you plan to print photos to resemble the real world... Fork out the extra dough and buy the real Epson ink. I know I will in the future!"
4,"So Far, So Good","Ink seems fine and fits perfectly in our printer, an Epson Stylus Photo R340. The only drawback is the printer asks you if you want to proceed, as it is not Epson ink. For what you save, it is worth pressing the button and moving on."
4,"The End of One Band, the Beginning of Another","A fascinating look at the final period of the Yardbirds, where you can hear Jimmy Page already formulating the sound he wanted to get out of a new band.The band's final concert was a few months later, and Page had already done some studio work with John Paul Jones (along with Keith Moon), so plans were well underway for a dramatic change.The sound quality is not the greatest, but you get the feel of the old LES Anderson Theater and what was going on in the NY rock scene (this same night, I was at a Cream concert at Hunter College!).Well worth the price if you are a Yardbirds fan......add a star for LZ fans."
1,I doubt if this is legit,I find it very difficult to believe that the copies of 'Live Yardbirds! Featuring Jimmy Page' being sold here are legit. Only 1000 copies were ever pressed by my company before it was yanked from the shelves and these 'sealed' copies are ALWAYS available here it seems. Buyer beware.Russ GarrettMooreland Street Records LLC
2,Live Yardbirds,"Live Yardbirds! Featuring Jimmy PagePurchse the album Yardbirds Happenings Ten Years Ago 1964-1968 over this album, you will enjoy it much better than the live album, in my opinion. I have been a Yardbirds fan since 1964 when I first heard them on AM Rock Radio, the best years are with Jeff Beck; although I was and still am a huge Led Zeppelin fan, have all their albums. Also a big Eric Clapton fan, love Cream and Derek and The Dominos."
3,Interesting.,"Listeners will find themselves hearing Jimmy Page setting out on the journey to Led Zeppelin - which is worth hearing - but they may be ultimately bored when confronted with terrible sound quality and band members nowhere near as capable as Plant, Jones, and Bonham."
4,liner notes from hell,"For those of you still trying to figure out the reading order of the liner notes, starting with the front cover as page 1, they read in this order: page 2,14,4,12,6,10,8,9,7,11 and 5. Most of the other reviews are on the mark as for performance and sound quality. For Yardbirds fans the historic importance of this release makes it a must have."
3,It was... ok,"This is an ok tool for practice, but hen swung at full speed, I experienced a feeling of dread as the hook flew of and got stuck in the trunk of a tree.Ok for it's price, though I will have to figure out how to reattach the hook to the chain"
2,Better spent elsewhere,"This item is ok for a ""practice"" device. If you want the real deal, buy elsewhere. I will say that it made a decent if not modified template for making my own out of carbon spring steel. It is cheap, will not hold an edge and would probably break with any type of real life application. That said, $20 to practice without getting sliced isn't bad. Needs to be advertised as such."
1,Far too Confusing,"Without the manual you would be lost!The THD of the so called KAM amplifier is far above any other comparable unit available.I think it is a gimmick to hide a cheap amp! Check the kenwood site for the KAM definition. I don't understand why the video connections on the back of the unit are not common with the front (back-video 1-2-3...front vcr 1-2, dvd). The volume control for all the channels is in db's and seems to be able to go into negative values. Having to scroll through all the audio modes with the selector knob is a joke. I didn't use the reciever long enought to understand all the features,needless to say I returned it. Maybe I expected too much from the kenwood."
3,Good Direct To DVD Film,"The Disney Secret of the Magic Gourd is a movie about a boy that finds a gourd while fishing. However, instead of having all of his dreams and wishes answered, his world gets turned upside down, as he learns that when things are earned, it is so much better. No Disney's best (espcially the dubbing), but certainly hold's your interest (and that of your young ones as well)"
3,Whimsical Film For Adults - Children Will Ask LOTS Of Questions Due To Chinese Culture...,"I never thought an animated gourd would be cute, but it is. Kinda like ""The Brave Little Toaster"", this morality story has the main focus on be careful what you wish for... The Chinese culture experience in this tale will have kids that are 6 and up asking questions about ""why are they doing that?"" or ""Is that how Chinese kids are in school?"" - things of that nature... All in all though, a cute morality play that only lacks understanding and little continuity problems due to the ""Americanization"" of this traditional Chinese children's book...Happy Watching!"
3,NOT SO MAGICAL GOURD!,"Nicely photographed in PANAVISION in pretty locations. The musical score is sweeping .However, the film must loose something in translation from the Chinese, because it is not very engaging. The special effects are middle of the road, and will appeal only to kids younger than 5. The movie is just OK! Rent it before you buy it, just in case!!!!!"
2,Not up to Disney's High Standards,"It was difficult to get past a ""Magic Gourd"" Disney has stuck with mainly animals to do magic but to do a squash as magical that is a far stretch. I feel it would have worked better if instead of using western voices and western names of people and the gourd that Disney would have used oriental people who could speak english and also used oriental names. Thank goodness Mulan was not westernized like this one was. I also don't understand the fixation on toe nail clipping. That was brought up 3 times in this movie. A very forgetable story but maybe it is a great story in China however I don't feel it will play in America. If you don't want to be disappointed then skip this one. Also, why are these 11 year olds protrayed with such higher intelligence. It seemed that the math and science projects that they were working on were more for high school students and not elementary school children."
1,Ummm.....just plain bad.,"Less than mediocre writing, an unlikeable main character and a predictible story made this a complete waste of money. Look elsewhere for mysteries with a female sleuth."
1,Hurtful rubbish ... the lady deserves better,"I have the original hardcover edition of this book published in 1983 and it is one of the worst biographies I have ever read. It was virtually co-authored by Veronica's grasping stage-mother who used her as a meal ticket and who also sued her for support once the money dried up. Miss Lake's real problem was alcohol and this book's dubious (and central) theme that she was a paranoid schizophrenic does not seem based on medical fact. The authors provide no proof of this 'diagnosis' -- only hearsay -- with Veronica's redoubtable mother as the only reference. The real truth about this beautiful, tragic actress who was more sinned against than sinning remains to be told, and sadly, may never be. Miss Lake's own autobiography ""Veronica"", while glossing over a lot, gives a much better sense of her as a person -- flawed, alcoholic, but seeking only love and peace of mind in a much less enlightened world than today."
1,How did this thing get published?,"I will keep this short and sweet. This book reads like it was written by a junior high school student trying to psychoanalyze an adult subject. These ridiculous assertions that if you are ie: withdrawn or depressed that you are a paranoid schizophrenic. Not to say that paranoid schizophrenics can't show some of these signs. Anyway, please don't waste your time on this junk."
4,The athlete's savior,"We buy beause of smooth, surface that is kind to the skin. Only 1 setback. It doesn't stay cold as long as other packs. Easy solution - get two. They are durable. Our chiropractor reccommended these years ago."
5,Great Reference Book.,This book obviously represents a considerable work effort. It presents volumes of information in a clear and concise manner. Invaluable as a reference for those with any interest in Irish history.
2,Just an okay book,"Somewhat interesting but I ran into a similar problem with another book about Ireland I read recently - it is written as if you have great familiarity with Irish history (which I don't). Very little is explored in-depth, some areas of Irish history seemed skimmed over or omitted entirely. Like the last book I read, it's okay for a review but not for the beginning ""student"". I'll try again somewhere else."
1,SHINY PLASTIC is what it really is.,This toilet paper holder is actually made of shiny plastic. The product number ends in a PB to further advance the falsehood. Amazon should have known.
2,Not Really Worth It,"Assembly instructions were hard to follow. Parts did not match up very well (took a lot of modifications to make them work) and once assembled not all parts functioned as they should.I wish I had colorized some of the internal parts before assembly. When the model is running, it is difficult to see much as everything is clear plastic. Red connecting rods, blue pistons and yellow rocker arms would have made a big difference."
5,Jingle Jamin' Great!,"This CD is one of the best Christmas CDs out there! The Highlights of this CD are, Aaron Carter, The Beu Sisters, Jesse McCartney, and Stevie Brock. All of the songs are great except for Fan_3. It's realy terrible. Also another highlight is Greg Reposo. He has grown up a lot since Dreamstreet1. Winter Wonderland 10/102. Santa Cluas Lane 5/103. Dear Santa 10/104. I Love Christmas 2/105. Santa Claus is Coming to Town 10/106. Sleigh Ride 7/107. Toy Town 7/108. One Way or Another 8/109. Jingle Bell Rock 10/1010. Run Rudolph Run 10/10 My Personal Favorite!11. My Christmas Wish 7/1012. Christmas Past,Present,and Future 6/1013. Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas 10/10 WOW!14. Why Dosn't Santa Like Me? 10/1015. White Christmas 10/1016. Wild Christmas 10/1017. Circle of Life 10/1o"
4,Good Holiday CD,"Radio Disney Jingle Jams is good, it should of been Holiday Jams 3, but the Holiday Jams contain both new and old songs. Jingle Jams only contains new songs. Fan_3's ""I Love Christmas"" song is horrible and it should of been one of the songs replaced on Jingle Jams 2005, along with Hilary Duff and Ashlee Simpson. How come J-Mac (Jesse McCartney) has two songs on the Jingle Jams? Aaron Cater was good, and I think Hilary Duff's remix of ""Santa Claus Lane"" is better then her orinigal."
1,Accompanying Example of Sounds Heard is a Farce at Best,"When I saw this gadget I thought to listen to the accompanying file, mp3, but it turns out ""Under Surveillance"" is the title of a black rap song...and the entire album is here for sample with many many curse and vulgar words that are not suitable for children. Nor dogs."
3,EARLY WAYNE!!!!!,"Two good John Wayne westerns. The prints are the typical splicy ones you get from the early Lone Star westerns. Otherwise, they look just fine and are quite entertaining. No Delta logos on this one."
4,Great home laminator,"This is a great laminator for family/home use. Occasionally I have to run something through a second time, but for single sheet lamination it's quick, easy, and perfect!"
1,Awful!,"This item is extremely SLOW and I have to run it through 3 times sometimes four to five before it laminates, and thats when the light is ready and the rollers are hot."
1,it would have zero stars if that was an option.,"It doesn't laminate well at all, I can send an item through four times and it still as areas that aren't sealed. I can't believe what a massive waste of time and money this machine is."
3,O.K. game,"Vigilante 8 had good graphics and lots of fun because you use guns and you feel like you have power (great point of the game!) The bad points of the game are that the the cars move very very bad, its not smooth! Also if you hit !near! a wall it says you hit a wall. I couldn't stand the movement problem, it made me more apart from the gameboy.This game was ok, If you like these fighting and fun games, I recommend Grand Theft Auto and if you want to see smooth movement, then buy Star Wars episode 1 racer!"
5,Excellent Value,"Purchased this drill press on sale and with a coupon. I'm too embarrassed to say how little I paid for this decent quality press. I don't really know a whole lot about drill presses but the finish and general overall quality are good. I received my drill press in good condition and it was very easy to assemble. It appears to function well enough. At the original price that Amazon offered this product ($170), it was unbelievably cheap. At the current price ($280), without out getting technically involved, I would still rate it a good value."
1,What happened to the price?,"What happened to the price on this item? Several days ago it was selling for $170. Now the price went up dramatically. For those of you who were able to buy at the original price, I believe you got a fair deal. For myself, I don't plan on spending this much on an import drill that is not a namebrand like Jet or Grizzly."
1,Cult Film,Calling this a cult film is a compliment. It is extremely cheesey in writing and acting. The budget must have been $100 made with dads camcorder. I don't know if I'll be able to finish watching this movie.... ever. The sound quality is very poor with whole sentences of dialougue droping out from being audibile. If you like Sic-fi with an Alien premece mixed with a dash of time travel try something else.... anything else. Now I know why I'm the first person to review this movie. But I hope I'm the last to waste money on it.
5,Love it! And I'm super-non-crunchy :),"I have been trying to move away from fake sugars (bad for my memory), but stevia's mild licorice taste really bothers me (I'm hyper-sensitive to licorice since I hate it so much, probably others would be fine with it). So I picked up this light agave syrup from a health-food grocery store. I just made my first cup of tea with it, and I have to say I really like it. It's a subtly different flavor than white sugar, I'd say your initial thought is slightly toward honey even though it doesn't have honey's strong taste, it's a softer flavor than white sugar or fake sugar somehow. In all, a very pleasant taste, and I will certainly tell the office baker about it :)"
1,Not light!!!!,"When I first ordered this product a couple years ago, it was a light honey color (as shown in their picture. The last two batches I received were an amber color and they added an unpleasant flavor to the margaritas I use this for. I was sent a replacement order and it is the same.What happened?"
3,Organic Blue Agave LIGHT,I ordered Blue Agave Light but received the DARK version. I am very disappointed with Amazon's mix-up
4,Natural sweetner,"As a diabetic, I really like this natural sweetner because it does not raise blood sugar. It has a nice taste with no lingering after-taste. It it not calorie free."
3,Agave review,"Good product. Bottles, however, leaked in the shipping process. They should be more airtight than they are."
5,Best low-glycemic sweetener on the market!,"This is the BEST low-glycemic sweetener on the market, and I've tried many brands of it and this is the most wonderful, with very little imprint on what you drink. It leaves coffees and herbal teas tasting like coffees and herbal teas! I sure hope they get this back soon as I'm rapidly running out and don't want to try to hunt it down over the net from anyone else... :("
4,Soft sai case,"I received this soft sai case very quickly after I ordered it. It was well packed and sent in very good condition. The case was exactly as described, it holds 2 sai and makes it very easy and convenient to transport them. The case seems sturdy, I only recently started using it. Am happy with this transaction."
2,Defective handle,"The handle on the sai case was defective. One of the handles was 4 inches longer than the other, preventing me from holding it with both handles. The case itself is nice. I'm waiting to hear from the vendor for a replacement."
4,Second best euro bootleg,Great one. Brilliant version of Present Tense. Eddy says: we are taking things to a next level here. He is right. Only Milan beats this one. When you decide to buy a few bootlegs you definitely have to get this one.
1,Poor quality control,"Right out of the box this toy was broken in two placed. The handle to lift the bucket was broken and a rivet on the bucket was missing. It was easier for me to fix this with a small bolt, epoxy and wire than to return it. Once fixed it is a little front heavy when the bucket is up so it tends to fall foward. I need to add some weight in the back end. Other than this the design is simple, which is good, and somewhat sturdy. However, I do not know how it would handle functioning as a bulldozer with a heavy hand. It is one of the few toys today that is not remote control or wired for sound. If you can get one that is not broken it should be a decent toy."
4,A good book :),"Hehehe....a good, quick read. The characters are a bit shallow, but this book was meant for fun."
4,Decent overview,"This book is a decent overview. It is not the book you would use as your primary tool for getting ready for the certification, but it would be a great 'cram week' tool. I am using it as the 'text book' for an overview course I am teaching to a group of teenagers involved in the Cyber Security Challenges. It is a great starting point, then we develop the individual topics with more detailed materials.Good book if you already have a good understanding of what you are doing and need to focus for the test. Don't try to take the test using this book alone, but it should be in you study library."
3,needed?,"Great basics book. Gets you used to terminology and has many tools listed for hacking across the board. However, if you follow this book verbatim threats will always be one step ahead, as is the going rate with security. Not a bad read."
3,A Good Overview,"This book provides a good overview of the objectives of the CEH. However, if you're looking for a study guide that provides more than a high-level preview of the exam content, this is not the book for you."
5,IS Auditor's Good Guide,Everything an auditor who need to do network security reviews should know is explained nicely
1,Sybex STAMP of Approval,"I recently took my CEH and passed, so from first hand experience with ""using"" this book as exam prep: I sat around with a group of friends and to help us all study we each read a chapter's practice questions and took turns answering. After the very first chapter, a pattern started to emerge. The incorrectness of these questions and answers were so obvious that we started to preface certain questions with ""This question has the Sybex CEH stamp of approval"", as we were uncertain at the time who to lay the blame on, Sybex or the CEH in general. After the preface was said, everyone in the group knew to answer with the most absurd answer option, and usually got it correct (according to the book). As stated above in the other 1-star comment, I have filled this book in a bown cardboard grave, hopefully never to hurt anyone else. I may bring it out for laughs once in a while now that I think of it. You have been warned."
4,Easy Network Access,"The claim of cool operation is true. I've had the drive for 2 weeks now, have never turned it off and it remains cool to the touch unlike a lot of external USB drives. I haven't tried to connect a printer off of it yet but that's next.The drive is not lightning fast (didn't expect it to be) since it's competing for network resources with your other network devices but performance is acceptible. I have 4 PCs. The setup was as fast as connecting the drive to the network, powering it up and installing the software on each PC. So pleased with this product, I'm ordering a 250GB version as well. 4 stars due to speed limitations"
5,Fabulous drive,"I've had this drive for over 6 months and it's been FABULOUS! I've attached my Canon USB printer to it and it works great. Setup was fast and easy and the drive operates cool and fast! Sharing the printer is just like sharing any other network resouce, but since I never turn the WD drive or my wireless router off, the shared drive and my printer are always available from any computer on my LAN.The LINUX kernel provides a basic level of security and privacy (username and password) so everyone has their own personal folder."
4,"Fine book, but don't make evolution a religion.","The book is excellent for people who think evolution somehow contradicts soft-core religion, but we could all do without reviews stating quasi-religious absurdities like ""Living systems have a natural tendency to evolve toward ever-greater order and complexity, while 'inorganic' matter tends toward increasing entropy."" Living systems, like any heat engine, route energy to reduce local entropy, and evolution does favor efficient energy conversion, but ""ever greater order and complexity"" overstates the case. All living things die and tend toward equilibrium entropy, organic or not. Life is subject to --and utilizes -- all of the constraints of thermodynamics."
5,A new approach to science and culture,"I have read thousands of books. This is one of three that I have reread immediately. It is a good read. It demands attention and thinking. It is not an easy read.Wilson is an evolutionary biologist and ""Everyone"" is focused on his experience. I am a physical chemist and inventor and find that my experience maps very well into ""Everyone.""Gould argued that science (evolution) and religion are non-overlapping magisteria. He argues that they are derived from different teaching roots. Wilson makes a good case showing that religions (at least those that lead to altruistic actions) are derived naturally through the processes of evolution.I have given away four copies. From discussion with the recipients, they have been well received."
2,Waste of time and money,"Well, I must say I am very disappointed with this book. The way things are ordered in it, is very bad, with a lots of incomplete examples about corporate identity designs. The design examples, are very poor and they don't reflect the good and modern graphic design nowadays. Don't waste your money and time on this book. Please take a good look at your street, I'm sure you will find there better graphic design examples."
1,"Quite possibly the worst ""academic"" book in history","I read this book while an undergraduate when I took a course in urban politics. Without doubt, it is the worst ""academic"" book I have ever read. Prof. Peterson's writing is brutally hard to follow. Granted, the topic is quite dry, but the author's writing makes it even worse. When I was finished, I had learned absolutely nothing, having wasted many hours of my life I shall never get back. Prof. Peterson would do well to learn from colleagues Lowi and Shefter how to write on dry topics with some panache."
3,Good Buy,"Easy to assemble - It took me about 25 minutes - only because I stopped to read the directions - Dimensions are 13""H x 14""Dx 21""L"
4,Wrong size excellent sais......,"I love the construction and weight of these Sais. I had some chrome ones long ago and they started to bend in the middle, these are steel. These are great for practice and training.My only problem is I should have ordered the 20"" ones. The sai should be at least 1"" past your elbow and these just barely cover the elbows themselves. The reason for this is obvious when you start practicing with the sai against other weapons. In the meamtime these will do until the new ones arrive."
2,O.k. Item for the Price,"This is a good item for a beginner.The tape around the handles reminds me of electrical tape.Otherwise, it's fine especially for a beginner."
3,A somewhat annoying book,"As per the other reviews, a fun breezy intro to the discovery of the elements with too many asides and inadequately researched science. Some of the asides are fun and some I found annoying. The discrepancy between the title and the content of the book gives a clue as to what is to come: the author sometimes starts out writing about A and then seems to decide that B is much more interesting and goes on and writes about that."
5,Vivid writing on an apparently dull subject,"This book provides a vivid history of chemistry, centered around a literary conceit: Mendeleyev's dream. It is an admirable effort in a field that sees few of any vitality.The only distressing flaw is the advocacy of Nicolas of Cusa as having exposed the fraudulence of the Donantion of Constantine. Convention has it that it was Lorenzo Valla who did so; Strathern ought to have acknowledged this. Some scholars will insist that it was Valla, however, a history of chemistry is not the place for advocating unusual theories on other subjects.Otherwise, a great read! Very plucky."
2,Flawed at best,"In chapter one the problems start, for instance the messenger after the battle of Marathon again dies after his 26 miles and 385 yards, it did not happen, I am no scholar and I know better, so what else is wrong? There is also the problem, still in the first chapter, of time. Maybe a better educated person than myself could sort this out but I do not know enough to get past the errors. Strathern has Thales alive and calculating eclipses in 585BC, then one century later it is the 5th century and we are hearing about Leucippus.A person with a firm grasp of history might enjoy this book but too many errors and too many value judgments left me baffled and unsatisfied."
2,Too elementary,"If you are looking for a genuine history of chemistry centered on the development of the periodic table--as the title and subtitle imply--then look elsewhere. This book provides a spotty history of science emphasizing the personalities involved, with greatest coverage of ancient and medieval figures. Overall, it was quite disappointing."
1,Dream? More like a coma!,"If Mendeleyev had the opportunity to read this... boy would he dream. It has to be the best cure for insomnia I've ever stumbled upon. There is far too much history and not enough Mendeleyev or periodic table - the reasons I bought the book in the first place. At two thirds of the way through, the only things keeping me going are sheer willpower to get to Meneleyev's cameo role and the fact I've cheated and flicked to the end so I know I'll get to it eventually. Definate thumbs down for anyone wanting to know more about the elements but fine for anyone wanting to know what inspired the research. Chemistry fascinates me... this book does not."
2,Slap Dash,"Mendeleyev's Dream continues a disturbing recent phenomenon post Sobel's ""Logitude"" of apparently hurriedly pulled together science history books.Catch phrases like ""must have seen"" or ""surely would have felt"" are evidence of hasty writing substituing for solid research. One last bug: what is it with publishers these days? So many travelogues without maps...and here an entire book essentially about the construction of the periodic table...with no periodic table? A little more care and preparation would help."
2,Loses a bit of credibility at the end.,"I thought this was a quite engaging book until I neared the end, and the author's science started to get a little sketchy. His description of why warm Coke is fizzier than cold Coke seems to be wrong, and in the final chapter about Mendeleyev, there are a couple of mistakes, such as confusing bismuth with boron, and a bizarre confusion between uranium and indium, which looks like it needs explaining. All in all a decent book let down by these oversights."
1,These disks deserve a 0/5 rating,"I recently purchased these disks from Amazon, but these blanks are horrible! Out of 3 first disks that I burned all 3 had corrupt data. I burned the first at 8x, and the other two at 4x. After burning Nero does verification, and it failed on all 3 disks. I included a CRC checking files on the disks as well, and they also failed. I was using LG GSA 4163B writer to burn these disks.Conclusion: There are cheap things that work less efficiently, and there are cheap things that just do Not work at all. This media falls into the ""do not work at all"" category."
2,Bait and switch,"I got the first batch in November, they were MCC and they're excellent. I just got the 2nd batch in December and they're Optodics. The 1st disc has scratches on top. The next disc hangs the drive while lead-in. Don't buy Velocity anymore. Spend a few more bucks and try brandnames now, as prices go down these days."
1,This is the worst DVD Media I ever saw,"This velocity DVD+R 8X is really a piece of junk! I would give it a zero star, if it is available.My TOSHIBA burner has been pretty sturdy with other DVD media, yet it can only recognized this disc as 4X, and after the burning process completed, the DVD drive can not read anything, even if I change the DVD drive. I tried 4 discs, and the results are all the same. I felt lucky that my DVD burner is not broken, as a few other users experience.Strongly suggest you do not buy this. I am going to return this tomorrow."
1,"Poor quality, unreliable","Got seduced by the low price ($30 for 100-pk), and figured that even if the typical one-third of the discs failed, the price would be still good. But in fact, three out of the first four burns failed (""could not perform end of disc-at-once"" error from Nero). My burner (KHypermedia) works fine with Ridata and Verbatims. Fortunately, I could return these bad discs to Amazon for a full refund. There are some lucky dogs here who apparently got higher quality discs in the Velocity spindle. I wasn't one of them, and you may not be either. Stay away. Give Velocity a chance to reconsider what they are selling."
2,Use caution...,"I got these discs because they seemed like a good deal. I had just bought a DVD recorder and was planning on transferring a lot of my favorite VHS recordings to DVD. The first several burns worked fine, but less than halfway through the stack I started getting bad discs. I tried pulling discs from the stack at random, but lately have been finding more coasters than successful discs, and I still have almost half the stack left. Oddly enough, they work fine in my other DVD player as long as I can get a successful original recording. I have to say I'm very disappointed; guess I'll have to stick with brand-name media."
1,I would not recommend Velocity DVD+R media,"4 out of the first 9 Velocity DVD+Rs from this 100-pack that I tried burning at 8x failed to burn correctly. This is the first time that I have had problems burning DVD media and, though I may have had a bad batch, I will not risk buying Velocity DVDs again."
1,Cheating without label on it,"Initially I felt that they have shipped wrongly with CDs instead of DVDs. So I requested for replacement. I got the new package, but still not good quality. Some DVD discs are not recognizable by my computer. One in every three is faulty disc. I am not suggesting this to any one."
2,Buyer's watch out,I have tried several different types of dvd-r's and i have to say i have not had a problem with any until now. With Velocity i have had several burn failures while burning dvd's. I would have to say that 1 out of every 4 or 5 fail. Would I buy this product again. NO!!!!
1,0 star quality product,"Well, 15 dvds later and my computer (and every other) can not recognize a single disk I have burnt. Now I tried burning on every speed my plextor supports and I have come to the conclusion that this is the most worthless thing I have ever bought on amazon. Mabey some of these other guys got lucky with 1 in 3 but so far my record in 0 in 15 and counting. Unfortunately I fell in to that little rebate trap (doh) and now I can not return them. Nice, well hope you have better luck in purchasing this product and learn from my experience, test before jumping all over that rebate."
1,This DVD broke my DVD+RW Drive.,"When I made the first DVD copy, my drive was broken right away.Please don't buy this."
2,Agree with the current reviews,"Last year these Velocity 100pk DVD+R were MCC discs. Those discs were of decent quality especially for their price. However, as of the begining of this year, the discs shipped are now from another manufacturer OR8 (Optodisc). These discs are just not as reliable as the MCC discs that Velocity was shipping last year.It seems that these discs have a decent burn rate, but you can tell that the manufacturing is just not quite up to spec.Additionally, my DVD-recorder/VCR (AKAI, Lite-On) can not recognize the OR8 Discs. So far everything else, Sony, Memorex, TDK, Ridata, Phillips, and OLD Velocity have worked great.My LaCie dvd burner (external) and Lite-On drives on the PC have no problems except that it can only burn the media at 4x, not 8x as stated."
3,MCC made in Taiwan is not necessarily fake,"Just wanted to clarify something...Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (MCC/MKM) hasn't made any of its discs in Japan since the 2x DVD-R days. The majority of MCC media (yes, legitimate MCC media) is made in Taiwan by Prodisc or CMC using MCC dye and equipment, with very few being made at MCC's own plant in Singapore. Just check out any of the Verbatim 8x DVD-R media in retail stores. Most, if not all of it will be made in Taiwan. The only real way to determine if Velocity discs are fake MCC or legit MCC made by Prodisc is to check the serial number etched in the dye side of the disc, around the hub area. If it's a number that starts with ZCXXXX or ZDXXXX and ends in X47B, it's legit."
1,Very Very Bad,"Never did a review before but I am compelled to write it for this.'penny wise, pound foolish'. Tried to save 10 bucks by buying this, but wasted 10s of hours copying videos for backups. They write without any errors, but when I play them, they skip or hang like crazy. I tried them on 4 different DVD players; same issue with 90% of the DVDsStick with named brand and you won't regret it."
2,Buyer beware...,"These disks burn ok and play ok but there seems to be a flaw in each and every one. I use mine to burn movies and around the 1:18 mark, the picture and sound gets choppy and skips. This continues for about 3 minutes then goes away. This is a problem because the 1:18 mark in many movies is an important period of time when some sort of climax is taking place. Maybe I just got a bad batch..."
3,Broken Box,The DVD's seem to be fine but the plastic case in which the DVD's came was broken totally.. and it was even more trouble for me as i did not have a case to place all of the 100 DVD's anywhere!! they are just lying in my drawer right now till i dont get another cylindrical case for them....
2,Can burn only at 4x,I got a OptodiscOR8 discs which can burn only at 4X max with NEC 2500A drive and Negro 6.07. The 1st disc on the stack is scratched badly on the surface. I'm not happy at all with the price I have paid $30.
3,Not worth the price!,"For over $24.00 this gun is not worth the price. It is small, mostly plastic, and cheaply made! Not happy!Another problem with this toy is that the hammer doesn't often hit straight on the cap roll, and misfires. You have to constantly readjust the roll behind the hammer.That being said my grandchildren still enjoy playing with them."
3,"OK Gun, BUT DO NOT BUY CAPS THAT AMAZON RECOMMENDS",You need paper caps with this - not what Amazon is recommended (the plastic ones). I had a very disappointed boy this Christmas and this week because I bought what was grouped and it was wrong.
1,nothing like the pic,the pic shows that the gun was black but when i got the gun for a birthday gift i opened it and it was brown it looked very fake and cheap nothing like the pic
1,Picture not accurate,Received this gun today and it is brown not black. Very unhappy. Not the product I paid for. Would like to speak with someone about this but don't know who to contact.
2,too easy,this game is too easy. deer keep coming out and are too easy to shoot. i cant tell any differnce when i do a deer call and when i dont. you cant tell if you about to shoot a big deer or a little deer even with binoculars. this game is definatly not worth buying. dont make the mistake i did.
2,Don't make a mistake,"I made a mistake buying this game. Its way to easy and it gets boring after a while. The deer just get right in front of the gun and stand there. Also, you can't even tell if it's a big deer or not. I tink you are wasting your money buying this boring game. Only thing getting it higher than one star is the subject matter"
1,boring,"I had never tried a hunting game before but this is terrible. you go into the wild and look for deer droppings. when you see some you look around for a deer. wait one will come, then shoot it with either a crossbow or gun. then you do it again. sooo boring."
1,Skip This One,"There is unquestionably a need for literary criticism of Terry Pratchett. But this is not the place to start.The book is riddled with major and minor errors (Slant, a lawyer character, is a zombie, not a vampire). Plot summaries are incomplete and inaccurate. Published in 2001, there are a lot of books published since. And his ratings are terribly arbitrary.There is a better book of criticism: ""Guilty of Literature."" I recommend students of Pratchett start there and leave this for the remainder bins."
5,Episode 1,"I'll assume you're reading this because you have Pop Bus and People Mover, and want to know whether Episode 1 is worth your money.It is. It's a high-quality studio recording, not one-take demos recorded in Goolkasion's basement. The signature Elevator Drops sound is there. The songs are very good; two or three are among their best material (good enough to have re-appeared later imho), with only one poor song.Recorded from 1992-1994, it doesn't have the continuity of an album. That's the only bad thing I can say about it."
3,average media...,"Got these when they were on sale a few months ago. Pretty disappointed with them. They are shiny silver top like many stated. This isnt bad with DVDs! Shiny tops arent like CDs because the actual layer that is written on is ""sandwitched"" between two plastic layers unlike CDs. That is why someone coudnt gauge the silver off on another post.Anyways... created about 15 coasters at one point and coudnt figure out why. Turns out burning at 8x (like they're rated for) doesnt cut it. Lowered it to 4x and no coasters so far. It hasnt been long enough for me to test longitivity.A friend borrowed a movie which plays fine on my Phillips DVD player and would freeze on his cheapo player. So if your player's picky, move along and get some TY or Rideks."
1,Garbage,"I ended up purchasing 150 of these disks,boy was that a waste of money. Not a single disk i have burned has worked, looks like it burns fine, but try and open the disk up and there are no files, it has been burned too, with nothing showing up."
5,Excellent Disks!!!,I purchased a Velocity DVD+R 8X 25-Spindle from Amazon. I am totally satisfied with this product as all disks were always burned successfully. And the burned disks can be played on more DVD players than even the branded ones. Shining surface is not a problem for me. Plus it's a bargain for the price paid.
1,TERRIBLE customer service - can't even reach them to use product,"Whatever you do, don't order the downloadable version of this software. I ordered it last night and downloaded it but it won't allow me to access the product without a product key -- which usually comes with the disc or, if a downloadable software, an email is sent to customer with a product key. Memory mixer never provided me with a code and has been unreachable all day. Their website is now down and their phone numbers aren't working either. I wouldn't even think this was a real business except for the fact that Amazon has reviews of the product! I would DEFINITELY be wary before ordering this product. I just hope I'm able to use it eventually!!"
2,We Can Work It OUt,simplistic and does not speak to me...does not meet my expectations for clear help in this area...
1,Watching a movie made in a garrage!,"Don't waste your money on this, you could have made it yourself for a few bucks with a video camera."
1,Ouch!,This is one of the worst quality movies I've seen in a long time. It looks like it was taped with a home video camera. It reminds me of a bad porn movie but without the sex.
5,Excellent primer for beginners,"This DVD is an excellent primer for beginners on strumming styles and ""tricks"" and techniques. The title is misleading though; really how can anything be complete in an hour?Ralph Shaw is a great teacher, although I vacillate between finding him charming and finding him a tad ""nerdy."" I really didn't start playing the ukulele to learn how to play ""Froggy Went A Courtin'"" or ""Hello My Baby,"" but to each his own. He explains things very clearly and then demonstrates how it actually sounds. He is a very accomplished player.I had been playing the uke for about 2 months before getting this DVD, and it has made playing the uke about 10 times more fun. Using Shaw's techniques can turn your plunking and plinking into real, joyful sounding music.I recommend this for anyone beginning to learn the ukulele."
2,Disappointed,"I have seen videos elsewhere that showed the finger placement and even the tab right on the screen to help you. I was expecting this kind of help. Instead I get to watch Mr. Shaw do his thing and garnered very little.Complete?, Ha, barely an introduction."
2,Not enough technique for the money,"Title is deceiving. I thought this DVD was more for advanced players. I looked for demonstration of more techniques and stylings than basics. I did not feel I got my moneys worth especially with the title of the album ""The COMPLETE Ukulele Course""."
2,Lacks content,"I am surprised at all the positive comments for this DVD. It is so incomplete. I don't plan to reference this ""complete"" dvd after the first viewing. I did like the song, ""hello my baby."" If you are a beginner UKE player, then I would recommend Mr. Shaw's DVD for Kids. I was more complete than this dvd, it had several chords and a book of songs. Good book and dvd for a total beginner."
2,Just not a good value.,"Not enough video for the nearly $30 I paid for it. I appreciate the eccentric guy's personality, but the instruction was seemingly unrehearsed and not of much value. You can learn a lot more from other websites out there ( I will refrain from naming them here) for free."
2,Not for beginners!,"Ralph Shaw is an accomplished uke player. I recently bought a uke, and am trying to learn how to play it. I thought this video would be the answer. There are some good tips - but it's more for someone who already knows how to play - and want some advanced strumming techniques."
2,Overall 2 stars,"With all honesty I was hoping that I could trust the fellow reviewers of this product, unfortunately my opinion differed that than the majority who like it. This course was taken basically in one shot . I didn't notice any editing, basically it was a camera on a tripod, and a guy sitting on a stool with a black backdrop, and he either read from queue cards or had a poster bored that listed the topics had to go over.I was disappointed that there was never any zooming in on the fingers or any type of editing to stretch the course out for those who don't catch on after the first try of things. Honestly it felt as if this was a rushed course that had a deadline. I was very dissatisfied by it and am in search of a better ukulele teaching book/video."
5,Great Video!,"Ralph Shaw is a very great teacher. He is very exuberant when explaining techniques on the uke, and he also adds a lot of little tips and insight along the way.I recommend this video to any beginner, and to those with some knowledge of the uke."
4,Good stuff to practice,"When I first put in the DVD I was a little put off by the low-budget production, but the actual content is really pretty good. The very basics are VERY basic, but he moves really quick into good techniques to master. Don't get this to learn lots of songs, but to learn good habits. The rewind, pause and fast-forward are essential with this tape. Although it's only about 1 hour long, there's probably 10-20 hours of good practice work from it. Despite the black curtain background, the DVD is one of the better instructional videos I've bought."
4,4 stars if your a haunted fan,"Its not the most professional thing I have ever seen. Its more like a well done bootleg. But if your a fan of the band its a fun thing to own. The sound at the show in sweden is much better and the picture is better at the Japanese show but what can you do this is a small underground band so they made a small underground DVD. What do you expect there from Sweden the Tax rates are 50% give them a break. The tour of the studio was cool, it was great to see the place where so many great metal albums in recent history have been recorded. If your looking for a really slick production go no further but if you love the band you'll have fun seeing the inner workings."
3,Good,"Not bad, not awesome, just good. It's a realistic video archive about this metal band and some of its shows around the world."
5,Great music to relax the kids and put them fast asleep.,"I've been playing the Dream A Little Dream tape for both of my kids, now age 5 and 2 and it still calms them down and puts them fast asleep. Just the other night, my five year old, who was anxious about his first day of kindergarten and couldn't fall asleep, asked for the tape that I played when he was a baby. I immediately turned it on and within minutes he was resting peacefully. This tape has been a real joy to listen to over and over again. It always brings back the memories I have of them when they were newborns and we were rocking together to the music."
1,Yuck!,"I received both the ""Dream a Little Dream"" and the original ""Transitions"" CDs last night as gifts. I had listed both on my Amazon baby registry. I listened to both last night as I was nursing my newborn and LOVED the Transitions CD but could not even bear to listen to the entire ""Dream a Little Dream"" CD -- it was sappy and boring and only a very vague womb sound was audible at random points. Had I been able to listen to samples from ""Dream a Little Dream"" I never would have listed it on my registry."
5,Makes Pliny the Elder Hot.,"I like these poems alot. I am for poems that play with History, Pliny, Love, and Elephants. If you like Juan Ruiz, Antonio Porchia, Hesiod or Rumi, you will like these poems. They are very sneaky. They seemed like quick reads, but then they haunted me for more minutes and today. I'll stop talking so you can see what I mean. ""When I say 'you' in my poems I mean you. I know it's weird: we barely met."" --Natural History"
3,Just OK,"The smoothness and close shave is good. But, the smell is not. I will not be able to use this product for that reason."
2,Not so good...,I just didn't like this book very much. While it may have been a case of personal taste this book didn't seem very engaging or interesting. It was an interesting idea to begin with but the book seemed to drag on and on. It could have been a lot better than it was. I wouldn't recomend it.
1,DO NOT PUT YOURSELF THROUGH PAIN,I had to read this book for school this summer and abosolutely one-hundred percent HATED IT!! If you do not HAVE to read this book I suggest not putting yourself through the pain that I enduerd and suggest that you do not under any cercumstances read this book!
4,"Creepy, Intricate, and Entertaining","Chris Wooding has created an intricate world full of believable mosters (both wych-kin and human) that will appeal to readers of fantasy and horror alike. The characters can fall a little flat, and Alaizabel, the so-called heroine of the book, seems incredibly wimpy and helpless to me (despite being described as strong and courageous within the book), but the unique setting interesting plot more than make up for any character shortcomings. The plot moves along at a very nice pace - fast enough to keep the reader interested, but slow enough that we can pause to take in the intricacies of the alternand ate history-type world as well. The ending climactic sequence especially is a page-turner that will keep readers up way past bedtime. ""The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray"" is definitely worth checking out."
4,An engaging and satisfying read,"I've been eagerly anticipating this book and I'm pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. After a little bit of a slow start I was firmly pulled into this vivid and at times lyrical story. Thaniel is a wych-hunter and is quite familiar with the darker side of London, and the wych-kyn that are permiating the city. After he meets Alaizabel he becomes part of a series of events that have far reaching and dire consequences, Thaniel, along with an unlikely group of others seek the survival of the city. This would appeal to Junior High and above though the content (violence and the occult) may restrict this to older readers. This would be a good offering for reluctant readers."
5,Ethnography at its best,"I would second what the other reviewer said. The book is refreshingly free of jargon and written with an open, humble tone. The author clearly is a good listener who does not jump to quick conclusions or make snap judgments about people. Her discussion of the controversies over bilingual education programs in Peru--and the differing views of state officials, ngos, activists, and community members--is fascinating, as is the discussion in the last full chapter of changing notions of what it means to be indigenous. Again, no post-modern jargon here--just an eye for complexity. She also offer some challenging thoughts on the notion of Peru having an absence of indigenous activism compared to Ecuador or Bolivia. Again, she does that with a lack of pretension or scholarly self-righteousness that is welcom. I just used it with my undergrads in a polisci class with great success. If this topic interests you, this is an important book to read."
1,Complaint,"From the picture shown and that 9 X 11 1/2"" envelopes where said to be for this machine I thought that it was a full size, not a card size. I haven't used it. I hate to return things so I will live with my mistake."
1,Cheaply made...,I purchased this item for my Ball Pythons but it arrived today ruined. The bottom of the cave was totally smashed because the product was made of an extremely thin brittle plastic like material and packaged with two small pieces of Styrofoam that did not secure the item in the box. I'm very disappointed in the quality of this item and even if it had arrived intact I would have still returned it because there is no way it could be used for what it was designed and last any length of time. Spend your money on something less expensive and of higher quality.
2,Poor Manufacturing Technique,"the technique for manufacturing the bases of these, does not suit their use.by the nature of how they are cast there is no way to gauge the wall thickness of their product. What that means is you may wind up with one like mine, where a slight bump could crack it. The Large I bought a few weeks ago, had a crack, which has since expanded revealing some areas thinner than an egg shell (no kidding) maybe fine for a sculpture but not something to be used, handled and cleaned. With my geckos, I have to pull it out almost every day to check for eggs.It's really just a gamble as far as how durable they are, you and the manufacturer have no way of knowing how thick the walls are. Household plaster would be better than what they used to make these, but it would have increased shipping costs from China.I.e. they should have used a different manufacturing techniqueThey do look nice and are functional, if they stay together."
1,Save your money and buy a better hide,"Save your money and buy a different product. The size of this product is perfect for what I needed however while cleaning this product with water and soap I applied minimal pressure and was able to break through the bottom of this product, for some reason they made the bottom a hollow thin piece of plastic. I am glad that it broke in my hands and did not hurt any of my pets, since this product is made for snakes I do not see how any snake could be safe in this shelter."
3,The Zoo Med Reptile Shelter...,"This item would be fantastic if it wasn't so cheaply made. I ordered this item, it came broken. I had another sent to me - That came broken as well. The first one was beyond repair. The second I suppose you could fix somehow. It's a shame, this product would be awesome if it wasn't so easily broke during shipping. Poor packaging on the manufactures part I think."
5,Python Loves Them!,"My full grown Ball Python has 2 large of these in her tank she loves them. They are very easy to clean, and I keep a small amount of reptile bark or moss in them as well. Best hides I have ever had."
5,A safe way to dispose of used insulin needles,This needle disintegrated is a very unique and safe and affordable way for an insulin dependent self injecter can rid of the used needles . I used to have to save milk cartons with screw on lids to safely dispose of the used syringes but now it's totally safe for everyone in my household and for the enviroment. Plus it will help get junkies to stop looking for any kind of needle. It will help in the prevention of Aids/HIV and Hepatitis C. This was my first purchase with Amazon.com but it certainly won't be my last!!!
2,Boring,"Maybe is the translation, maybe this is not what I expected, but I just found the item boring...maybe I dont enjoy endless beatings and mistreatments, abuse of power and senseless lifes..."
3,Chinese peasants,The story tells the sad existence of farmers in China during the 1980's. the corruption and misguided policies still create treacherous lives for the poor.
1,Nobel Prize winner,I found this to be boring. Did not read beyond the first chapter. Would not recommend to a general audience.
1,Garlic Ballads Mo Yan,"Courage in writing this book and insight into the oppression of the society of the country, but primative writing and a painful story. Nobel for courage not literature."
4,Just put this book down.,"Wonderfully descriptive language. Trying to absorb the culture which to me is so intolerant, unforgiving, misplaced, backward, but a great opening to how a more rural part of the society lives. My heart goes out to the hardworking farmers who toil to the bone. Down with corruption all over the globe! Imagine a more pure society,.. someday? I truly love learning all I can about the Chinese culture, this is a great avenue, reading their very own authors. God Bless your hard work, thank you, Mr. Mo."
3,"KIndle edition is fixed, book is amazing","The Kindle edition is fine and reads well (on my Fire) and the story is amazing - gripping, incredibly visual, pulsating with detail and life. You really feel you are transported to another place (China) and time (pre-Internet era) and you really feel for the characters and what they went through. It's a rollercoaster story about people trying to get through incredibly difficult conditions, and some parts are gaspingly sad. You will feel like you lived another life if you read it.I didn't see any typos - kudos to the publisher that they fixed whatever was wrong so quickly."
2,Don't buy the Kindle edition!,"This review is not for the book itself, but simply for the Kindle edition. It is full of errors that show that absolutely no one proofread it before converting it to an eBook. Often the word ""it's"" is converted to ""itdts"", and ""lightly"" becomes ""lighdy"", and so on. Also during dialogue, the first set of quotation marks is missing making everything confusing-for instance:I didn't know what was going on"", he said.would just appear in the middle of a sentence. It's confusing and very nearly unreadable-a shame for such a wonderful book. For the record I would never rate the tale itself so low, but feel it necessary to do so for this edition because of the shoddy proofreading"
4,I like his other book even better,His books are set in NE China in the 1900's. If you liked the Malagro Beanfield Wars (written about water rights in Mexico around 1971) you will like this one. I'm now reading Big Breasts and Wide Hips by this guy and it's even better. I'm planning on working my way through his books as fast as I can get them on Kindle.
4,"Great book, shoddy production","I'll leave the literary criticism to others, but wanted to point out that this book is horribly shoddily produced with all kinds of spelling and punctuation mistakes. For instance, ""I'm"" might be written as ""fm""; it almost seems a printed version was OCR'd with no follow-up proofing. This is quite embarrassing for a translation of a Nobel prize winner's work. I almost, but not quite, wanted to ask for my money back."
2,Too much garlic!,I simply did not like this book. I tried hard but could not finish it. The story is a translation so maybe it lost something along the way. I found the characters unappealing and became fed up with all the filth and brutality. And by this I mean the hawking and spitting and other decriptions of forced eating and drinking of bodily products.I read for pleasure and there was no pleasure in this book.Mo Yan is one of China's lauded writers so from a literary point of view he probably deserves the accolades but it is NOT an enjoyable read.
4,Touching!!!,"Garlic is the pretext to write the touching stories of a couple and China. The writing quality is so high that permits ""see, listen and smell"" the scenes and the characters."
5,Communist China Explored,"This novel was an interesting insight into the bungled beaurocracy and blind obedience of the communist era in China. The lives of the main characters were passionately portayed and as the reader I cared deeply for their struggles. The descriptions of events were often brutal and graffic, yet not upsetting. There was often humour in amongst the pitiful poverty and tragedy of the main characters.. The plot's setting of a traditional society set against the Communist regime was enlightening and insightful. The ballads sung at the beginning of each chapter pulled the story together in a poetic way. A reread of the words at the end of the novel was worthwhile."
2,Serious Lack of Substance,"As stated in other reviews, this is not a how-to book. My take is the author wants one to look at real estate as a serious investment. The problem I have with the book is that it can be accomplished in 30 pages. There is a lot of fluff."
1,Save you money.,"The Author starts out pushing hype with unrealistic numbers. When I read this crap it makes me cringe. Two great books are ""How I made 5 million in real estate"" by Nickerson and ""Investing in Real Estate"" by Andrew McLean. I have been buying foreclosures in MI. I really dont see it getting you a jet or 20 million like this snake oil guy hypes but you can build a nice net worth over time andperhaps replace your earned income.I felt that Kiyosakis Cash Flow Qaudrant and Rich Dad Poor Dad were outstaniding pieces of work. When I read crap like Real EstateRiches I wonder if Kiyasaki has gone down the wrong path for a quick buck."
2,Dolf Dont Know USA,"The book has some basic good reasons to invest in real estate rather than the stk mkt. But this guy is an Aussie that knows NOTHING about US tax law, especially when it comes to depreciation. I found the book very lacking.Kawasaki is a mkting con man anyway."
2,Light weekend reading for someone interested in real estate,"Other reviews here have summed up this book well in the fact that it is an incredibly vague motivational type of book more than it teaches you how to invest in real estate at all.It seems that all ""Rich Dad"" books are vague and such, but at least Rich Dad/Poor Dad gave a different philosophy of how to think about money and such. This book gives nothing more than a sales pitch about how wonderful real estate is and then tries to sell you his other products.I personally have had very bad luck with these types of authors that try to sell the grass that's always greener on the other side. You buy their other books and it just routes you to a home study course which routes you to the seminars which routes you to the personal coaching lectures, etc."
2,Not so great as I thought it would be,"I have been very involved in real estate for over the last year. I have read several books about the subject, go to a real estate investment club once a month, and bought a duplex two months ago. Learning how to invest WISELY in real estate takes time and is a constant learning process. There are many specifics you need to know about investing in real estate, and I do not think this book covers them. You definately cannot jump in head first by just reading this book. I do not think he wrote this book with the mindset of educating beginners, I feel like he wrote this book for himself to understand, not the general public. There are a few good tips in this book, but there are other books that will inform you much better about this subject matter and take you step by step through the investment process. Borrow this book, but don't buy it, it isn't worth the money."
2,Good for inspiration but be careful...,"This is a good book to really inspire a new reader.However, its tough to overlook the gross distortions that the author makes.For example, he makes a huge argument to start the book off saying how you can't use leverage in the stock market. Well, most of the companies you invest in will use debt for you let alone trading on margin. Furthermore, he fails to realize that not all stocks have giant swings.Thats just what he fails to mention. On top of that, some of the numbers he does use are needlessly exagerated. A 400 dollar paint job? Wake up Dolf, unless your hiring illegal immigrants I dont think thats going to raise property value much.I think the author does make some good points... but his distortions make me extremely wary, if im investing in property i dont want the glitz and glamour I want to know the risks in order to make an informed decision."
2,Real Estate Riches,"This was the first book I ever read on real estate, and at the time, I found the book to be very motivational and enjoyable to read. After having bought a couple of properties and read a few more books on real estate, I have come to re-evaluate the book. This book is only helpful if you are just starting out in real estate and want to obtain some VERY VERY general knowledge in the field. If you have ANY experience in real estate at all, don't bother reading this book. You won't learn anything new."
2,for the novice,"This book is written for novices trying to find out what real estate investing is like. It has no real advice nor practical tips on how to get into real estate. It is basically a story about the authors experiences in real estate. This book is very short, poorly written, and lacks informative material. To learn about real estate investing I strongly recommend ""Investing in Real Estate"" by McLean and Eldred. The McLean book is for beginning investors, but it is much more useful. You shouldn't waste your money on Real Estate Riches."
2,A Nice Appetizer,"Dr. de Roos' book has (admittedly) increased my interest in real estate investing, and I look forward to learning more about this subject. However, as others have pointed out, the author spends a lot of time ""preaching to the choir"" by spending half the book explaining why real estate investing is safer and more lucrative than stock market investing.I didn't learn as much as I would have liked. But it has inspired me to learn more from other sources."
2,"Good for basic ideas, bad for anything else.","I was disappointed with this book. I am a big fan of RK and his ideas, but this book seemed to be a way for RK to cash in on his populartiy and make some fast $$ for himself and his friend. There is no detailed plan for following through on the ideas the author proposes, so it's basically a primer for entry-level investors to give them ideas, but no nuts-and-bolts discussion on how to accomplish anything. I wouldn't recomment this book to anyone unless they were thinking of getting into real estate investing and had no idea where to begin."
2,Not enough meat,"I think the other reviewer's have said all that needs to be said about this book, there's just not enough meat. Robert's first 3 books were great and it made him very rich as well. It's not surprising that more ""Rich Dad"" books are being published since they have been very successful. Books like this one was published just to make money, not to educate anyone. All they did was include a bunch of balony information and stuck the ""Rich Dad"" label on it. Not very reliable."
3,"It's another Real Estate book, informative but...!","I thought it was a good book. but it has very little to do with its subtitle: Using your banker's money... He talks about that for maybe 2-4 pages. After that is mostly stories you can learn from but with very little advise (which is what I look for when I buy a book).It's mostly good ideas and examples of what he did, but he never explains in depth and you get no hints. You can tell that he definately knows his stuff, but it's almost as if he is trying to hold back on you. You'll get pumped up on R E but you may need other books for how-to insights."
1,Save your money!,"This is a waste of time and money - I have been quite indiscriminate in my reading of real estate investment books, and this is by far the worst. Kiyosaki is obviously more interested in making money than in dispensing good, solid advice. Avoid this at all cost (unless it makes you happy to hear people tell you how easy it is to make money in real estate, supporting that statement with questionable arithmetic)."
5,One of the best real estate books out there,"So many real estate books pretty much say the same thing over and over. This one is different. Dold de Roos and Robert Kiyosaki are to be congratulated for their uniqueness and independent thinking. And of course for providing advice based on actual experience by real investors, not just paper tigers who write, but have never even done their first deal.Thank you de Ross! Thank you Robert Kiyosaki!"
1,not very helpful,The book was not very helpful. I expected more specific information. Author did not touch specifics to American realestate investors investing in America. Many other better books out there. I would not even want to sell mine used to a beginner.
2,Nothing but Fluff,"This book is disappointing. It does little other than present some basic ideas which anyone the least-bit familiar with real estate investing should already know. Some chapters, such as the one on mortgage financing (which is extremely important), contain so little information, one wonders as to why they are even in the book. But this is Kiyosaki's stuff, and that's essentially what you get -- one or two ideas fluffed out into a whole book."
1,Rich Dad taught this fellow well.,"I have read several of Kiyosaki books, listened to his audio tapes and I always end up asking myself... WHERE'S THE BEEF. All of his materials are all fluff and no substance. While a part of me thinks he may be sincere in his attempt to educate, he would fail as a teacher. His lesson plans are lacking and leave the buyer struggling so that they buy more of his ""meatless"" products making him the only RICH DAD in America"
3,Need help with real estate math?,"Like most of Kiyosaki books, it gets you thinking and believing in real estate. You have to think it before you can act on it. You have to believe it before you can act on it without being afraid. This book gets you thinking. There are a few math formulas that I found helpful. But mostly it left me longing for property in New Zealand."
2,Not all that it is cracked up to be.,This book is comparable to the Dummy's books. It really doesn't offer any real estate advice that any other book couldn't have given. It was relitively boring.
5,This is the best that I have found--Amazon: 10 stars!,"I think that the reason for some of the 1 star reviews is that they expect this to be just like all of the other real estate books. They expect a huge tome covering everything that everybody else has already covered ad nauseum.Dolf's book is different. First he compares real estate to the stock market and explains the difference. Then he discusses the tax benefits of real estate investing better than anyone else and then explains his own techniques.Overall a great book. Not 5 stars, but worthy of 10 stars."
1,A 'feel good' book with little meat :o(,"What a disappointment! The more I think about it, the more irritated I get that I actually shelled out money for this book! The author spent WAY too much time heralding the benefits of real estate investing and VERY little time on actual details. I very much enjoyed Rich Dad, Poor Dad, but Real Estate Riches was a HUGE disappointment! I didn't come away with any new ideas or techniques - I already knew that real estate investing can be lucrative and didn't need to spend ... to have that confirmed. If you must read this book, check it out from the library and save your money!"
2,Too little substance,"This book primarily discusses stock market investing versus real estate investing, but without any serious numbers. While I'm no quant jock, I do want to see something other than assertions without thorough analysis. This book also lacks any useful guide to analyzing properties, neighborhoods, or rates of returns. Overall, I can't see why anyone would buy this book with so many better ones available (e.g., Investing in Real Estate, Buy It, Fix IT, Sell It, and Nickerson's now dated, but still helpful, $1000 into a Million in my Spare Time)."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"This book gives you no information regarding real estate what-so-ever. The author goes on and on about how wonderful Real Estate Is. We all know Real Estate is Great, but we also know that it takes money to make money. That is one thing that this author does not understand. We all know that your banker WILL NOT lend you money, unless you have money. This author makes money in book sales and seminar sales. He doesn't make money in real estate. Try buying a HOW-TO book, not a WHY-TO Book. NOT A GOOD READ."
2,No Comparison!,"I reviewed this book earlier, and now just want to add this comment: If you really want a thorough comparison of stocks to real estate, you must read Eldred's Value Investing in Real Estate. Eldred succeeds with specifics of why and how. In stark contrast, Real Estate Riches merely throws out glib generalities."
2,"Max marketing, mini return on investment",Dolf De Roos markets the concept of Real estate well but unfortunately has little more to offer the reader. He shares simple ideas using examples from New Zealand..(one of very few countries not to have capital gains tax on properties)which are interesting but may seem impractical. There are other books by De Roos on Real Estate investing which are more informative and a lot more hands on than this one. The book is still worth a read;just don't expect to retire young or retire rich from the information.
4,Real Estate Riches,"This book was informative, but you really need to go to a class to get proper teaching and help starting."
3,not for people with a financial background,"it's easy to read. but a summary of the book would probably fetch 2 pages. the writer tells us it's all very simple, which is probably true. but as with anything that is simple, you should be able to write that on 1 page.There must be better books out there."
4,ROOS'S IQ ON REAL ESTATE,"My personal opinion I really liked this book. For the beginning real estate investor there are many insights to the business. Roo's did a very good job on writing a informative book concerning the investment of a commercial endeavor. The only con to the book I can think of is the title page of ""HOW TO BECOME RICH USING YOUR BANKER'S MONEY"". After reading the book Roo's does not write much about this subject. Nevertheless, from the Rich Dad's Advisor Series this book is on the top of the list."
4,Good book on basics of real estate investing,"I read this back in 2003, when I was beginning my real estate investing business. I've read many books on real estate since then. This was a very good book on the basics. I recommend it for beginners who are building a foundational knowledge of investing in real estate. It isn't for the more more advanced investor, however. So as long as you keep that in mind if purchasing this then you should be good to go.All the best."
4,An excellent introduction to the world of real estate,"Coming with no experience and only a strong interest in learning about Real Estate investing, I found this book incredibly helpful. It is written in a survey style giving the reader a general overview of why real estate is such a smart investment, how to acquire property and other aspects in the game. The book is well written and easy to get into. You finish wanting to read more in-depth books and go out and see some properties. I would recommend this to anyone with no to little experience but if you've been in real estate before you might find one of his other books more helpful ."
1,Not recommended at all.,"I have read several books on real estate investing. The examples in this book are wrong at best. All examples on rental income do not account for property taxes, maintenance expenses and property managers fee (if applicable). So all those examples where cash-on-cash is more than 100%+ are wrong !!!But real estate is great, you can great returns, generally more than 15%. So, keep your interest in real estate investing but look for realistic examples somewhere else."
5,Real profits in real estate,"What I like aboout the Rcih Dad advisor series is that the books are written by people who are actually experienced and knowledgable about the topic they are writing on.For example, in this book, we have the great Dolf deRoos who has made a small fortune investing in real estate. He has walked the talk and talks the walk. He has been there, done it and done it again.If your goal is to become a sucessful real estate investor, then I highly recommend this great book by Dolf de Roos."
3,Quick starter read,"I read widely and think even the worst books nearly always offer enough in tips or insights to justify the time. This weak book is no exception to my general rule. Nevertheless, you can gain far more knowledge about how to get started and how to best profit from real estate from Unofficial Guide, Investing in Real Estate, or Rental Homes for Profit. In fact, I can't think of any book on real estate that doesn't offer more in the way of specific how-to."
1,Poor Dad's Real Estate Guide,"Of the series of Rich Dad books, this was by far the least informative and motivating. I was greatly disappointed in the substance and depth of treatment devoted to analizing the real estate investment. In addition, the theme of cash flow which was so dominate in other Rich Dad books was not treated with any depth. Other areas of real estate investment were lightly addressed. Based on the information presented, I would be very tentative investing in real estate based upon the information presented."
1,Tony Robbins for Real Estate,"This is a motivational / inspriational book, and provides very little *actionable* advice.If you are looking for information on ""How to Become Rich Using Your Banker's Money"" as the title indicates, you will be VERY disappointed."
1,Don't waste your time!,"Hello Real Estate readers. If no one else will suggest a better book instead of Real Estate Riches, I WILL! The Weekend Millionaire's Secrets to Investing in Real Estate: How to Become Wealthy in Your Spare Time. This is a great book, written by a Real Estate Investor that actually makes his money in Real Estate not in $2000 Seminars and $500 Software. I believe in Real Estate Investment and have made a substantial amount of money doing it. The Weekend Millionaire's Secrets is a great book for beginners. All I can say is, that the PH.D in Dolf's name is in Engineering (Not in writing - and there's a good reason for this)."
2,Puff,"The first half of this book is an intellectually insulting description of why you should invest in real estate, chapter after chapter covering what could have been said in a few pages. The second half of the book is better, but spends too much time talking about investing in New Zealand. The book oversimplifies investing, without digging in deeper on issues like operating costs for duplexes versus apartments etc. The book advocates maximum leverage without covering risks like rising interest rates, unexpected costs etc. The only useful info I found was in the discussion of internal rate of return for comparing investments. Don't expect any guidance on what costs you will really incur operating a property."
2,Mushroom lover cookbook,"OK - so I don't like mushrooms and the majority of recipes in this book call for them. I can leave them out but frankly I was disappointed that many of the recipes looked to be difficult to fix. There were not enough 'easy' ones and very many used strange parts of the deer/elk, such as brains, tongue, etc. Since we have our venison processed and don't ask for these bits to be saved we mainly need recipes using steak or hamburger. In this book these were in short supply."
3,"Works well, but I won't buy again.","I got a good deal on several large bottles of this from Amazon. It works great, but I am glad our supply is gone. I'm going back to the regular formula - the scent of this one becomes very overpowering when you use it in more than one room. And I generally like scented products, but this one is not for me."
3,Beginers only,DVD showing its age in presentation - also would have hoped for more detail of his early life -especially time spent in Algiers
4,great set,"If you want to learn about impressionist, this is a good choice. You will learn everything about those painters.The set go through the impressionist area from the beginning to the end with more details on Monet.Nice to watch, love it."
2,Frustrating on many levels,"I am glad that there are others in the world that are discussing the subjects written about in this book, however, I was left profoundly disappointed by this authors work. The matters discussed in this work are very important. However, I did not feel that the author did a good job exploring these matters. Though discussed, they were discussed from what appeared to be the position of a person that had made up their mind prior to reviewing the facts. I did not get the sense that I could trust what this author has written. I never trust the conclusions of a closed mind, and it felt as if this is what this author was presenting. Still, I think this work is valuable to some extent, and worth a partial perusal."
5,Fairy Pixie Ring,I found it to be exactly as described only much more attractive in person. A great little ring that catches others eyes making it an adorable conversation piece.Great buy for the money.
2,More about Shane Watts than Riding Skills,I'm tolerant with someone tooting their horn for a few minutes -- but not for half the video. There are some skills to learn between sponsor moments and the yak yak yak about Shane -- but no switch-back riding skill which I was most hoping to improve. This video is worth something less than half the price. The best and surprising feature about the video is the quality of the production -- it isn't like amateur video riding found on YouTube.
5,A collecter of the Heartland series.....,"This book was one of the better Heartland books. It's about Amy having to decide if she wants to give up Heartland and show, give up Storm and heal horses, or keep both and stress herself out. In fact, Amy was so stressed she almost hit one of the horses. Every time Amy goes to a show, she feels guilty, because one time when she left, Sundance got colic, and another time one of the horses got her foot stuck in the barn wall.(This horse is scared of everyone except Amy.) But at the end of the book, Amy did make a choice, to find out, you have to read the book yourself!!!!!!!!!!!This book was definately one of my favorites out of the series!"
3,Sooner Or Later,"Amy loves showing her horse Storm, and when she competes she and Storm both have a great time, adn not to mention almost always get blue ribbons. But every time Amy leaves Heartland she feels guilty. The horses at Heartland need to be cared for and healed.. Amy starts to think about how stressed she is getting and how it would be impossible to handle during the school year. Amy thinks maybe Storm could be a pleasure horse, but she remembers how Storm was bred to be competed and the way he becomes a different horse when he is in the show ring. Amy knows she can't compete Storm and work at Heartland and she will have to make a desicion sooner or later...I think this book was not as good as some of the other Heartland Books in the series, and it's kind of predictable what will happen but it's a Heartland Book and like all of them it's worth reading."
2,"Skip this one, you won't be missing anything","Lauren Brooke should just stop before these books get any worse. I think she's running out of good ideas, but still wants to keep writing the Heartland books. She is starting to repeat the plots: Amy has a problem, no one understands her, she cries alot, and then it's all solved. Also, Ty is totally unsupportive. Ben is much more sensitive.The other books, at least up to number ten, were really good. I really liked reading them.I rated this two stars, instead of zero, because I usually like the Heartland books. Also, at least it has horses in it. I hope the next one is better. I'm not too hopeful about correct information though; it said something about a hurricane in Virginia!"
3,"Not as impressed as others, but a pleasant read","I've seen nothing but glowing reviews of this book, both on Amazon, and on woodworking sites and forums. Many call it a ""classic"" and ""must read for every woodworker/cabinet maker"". I agree that it is a good book, and I don't consider my time or money wasted. But, the book is less of a helping hand and more of a exploration. If you hope this book gives guidance, tips, or will help you be a more proficient cabinetmaker, then you will be disappointed. In many ways it is more of a journal, or overview of the man's work. This is not instructional or educational. I would say it is more motivational."
5,A Cabinetmaker's Notebook,"This could be a book about anyone with a true passion for his work. It's not just woodworking, anything could be the topic. Here is an artist with a vision and belief in what he does. It has great value to him and he refuses to compromise his values to make things easier. He shares a great amount of background/personal information, which gives the reader a base for understanding his passion in woodworking. A truely fantasic person. I only wish I could have spent some time visiting with him."
3,One is not like the other.,"For the price, the sais i received are decent. However, they are not the same as the image above. The ones i received were black and round, not octagonal. And the handle wrap is in black with gold trim, as opposed to the ones above. I'm ok with that, but just be warned that you may receive a different pair of Sais than what's pictured above."
4,Satisfied,"I was looking for a cheap pair of sai, and this fit the bill. I am satisfied with the quality of the product, especially for the price paid. If in the future I am looking for more of the same, I will definately order from this user again."
5,SAI,Beautiful SAIs! They're exactly like I thought they were. Simple to understand movements and use.
1,Heard this is great!!,"I have always heard this was a great live recording, but as I bought it as one of my only two Amazon downloads, God only knows where it went. It seems anchored in some unopenable file. I'll never buy a download from Amazon again. The other one I bought (Timmy Curran) is also lost in cyber space."
5,best series ever,best series ever! you have to read it to find out how good it is! i already caught up to the writer! but now i hav 2 wait *_*
1,?,"The character Elle is cute, but the whole stor is boring and doesn't make any scene. All the books in the story line are piontless. It's like they copied the whole story form dragon ball z or something. DO NOT get this book unless you LIKE to waste money."
1,Forget it!,"There's no way you can watch anything with this item. I have a small Casio portable TV and it works fine in my house, so why doesn't this one? Money wasted!"
3,reidel decanter,"I purchased this for red wine. The decanter is beautiful, but expensive. I find that I don't use it that much, it takes up to much room on the table. I should have purchased a tall decanter."
3,Sony HMC-100 Portable Home Monitor Intercom System,"This product is a 3-channel intercom system, but you can NOT purchase an extra unit for the 3rd channel. If you want to use the 3rd channel, you have to purchase 2 extra units!"
1,I strongly recommend you don't purchase,"We have had to exchange this camera twice within the first month of having it, first it stopped taking pictures you had to shut it off zoom in and out then it would take it, the second camera did the same also it stopped taking the film, we tried several brands and it would just expose it all. very disapoointing. we contacted minolta they would only fix it not return or exchange it. we bought the canon sure shot 115 and love it so far!"
2,Took nice pictures....but it died,"I received this camera as a gift for Christmas 2004. The pictures I got from it were great with beautiful colors, and everything was fine until November 2005. The focus slowed WAY down, and it took me several attempts to take every picture. The zoom didn't work consistently, and the camera would refuse to take a picture for no discernable reason. Finally, just after the warranty expired (of course), it stopped working altogether. Wouldn't turn on or respond in any way to new film or batteries.When I called Konica Minolta, they told that I could not return or exchange, they would only repair. It would cost $99 for the repair, plus $12 to ship it back to me, plus whatever it cost me to ship it to them in the first place (from HI to CT). For ~$120, I'm just going to get another, newer camera."
5,This artist is not well known but he has an amazing gift.,David Garza is unlike any other artist that I have heard. He blends many different styles of music together with his own innate sense of melody and rhythm. Eyes Wide Open is one of his earlier albums and it demonstrates his tremendous musical range along with playful willingness to be goofy.
1,Big disappointment,Fans of This Euphoria and 4 Track Manifesto save your money. This is not of the same genre. This CD is extremely mellow and may put you to sleep and this is coming from the biggest David Garza fan on earth!
5,BEST KITTY PAD EVER,HAVE BEEN USING K-H PADS FOR FIVE YEARS NOW. I HAVE EIGHT OF THEM IN DIFFERENT CLIMBERS FOR MY NINE CATS. ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN FLAWLESS IN THEIR PERFORMANCE. I'M NOT REALLY THE ONE TO JUDGE: THE CATS LOVE THEM AND THEY ARE IN USE CONSTANTLY. YOU CAN'T MAKE A CAT LIKE ANYTHING IT DOESN'T WANT TO. KUDOS TO K-H FOR A SUPERIOR PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE.
5,pleased,Quality cover for my cats heated outdoor padthe material is thick and cushions him againstthe hard plastic of the heated pad
4,Heated Kitty bed,"Good quality, rather small for what you pay for, but the outdoor cats sure appreciate it."
2,Cats won't play,"The idea is cute and it seems fairly well made. It won't stay on the doorknob because the opening is too large. It would also be better if the dangling legs were a couple of inches longer. Basically I wasted 6.00, since none of my 5 cats, all w/ different personalities ignore it."
5,"Zamfir, one of the best pan flute musician in the world.","""The Master of the Pan Flute"".Gheorghe Zamfir is a Romanian ( eastern Europe ) pan flute musician. Zamfir is known for playing an expanded version of the traditional Romanian-style pan flute (nai) of 20 pipes to 22, 25, 28 and 30 pipes to increase its range, and obtaining as many as eight overtones (additionally to the fundamental tone) from each pipe by changing the embouchure. It's a delight for your ears."
5,Waterford Unity Candle Holders,"It was very pretty, exactly what we wanted to make my daughters wedding day SPECIAL."
5,Crystal Unity Candle Set,"We used this set at our wedding and it is beautiful, and a great price. It also looks great in our home. Thanks!"
5,"Great lyrics, meaningful music---can't get it out of my head","What a great songwriter! I can't get these songs out of my head...got the CD and love it. She should be on the Lilith Fair...Angels in the Attic is incredible, I Am Home makes me cry...Where Does It Hurt...there are so many great songs!"
4,Good Bargain,"It was a bargain item, but that means it was bargain quality. I got what I expected nothing more."
1,trash,"After the first day of use, I knew I could never trust this scale again. It shows huge swings on the weight, and it's really inaccurate. (I compared it to the electronic scale at the gym.) I was considering returning it, but the shipping cost, in comparison with the product cost, would have been ridiculous. It's certainly cheap, but I'd rather have bought something better instead of wasting money."
3,Cheap but will do.,"I have to reset it to zero all the time and I actually not quite sure if the scale is still accurate, so it might be off by a few pounds. Pretty heavy scale."
2,NOT very satisfying overall,"As a previous reviewer noted, Nargi weaves (knits?) her personal knitting story in with the stories of other knitters. This wouldn't be so bad, except she doesn't even like knitting. It's as if she felt like she Should be a knitter, and she just doesn't get knitting. Instead of celebrating the stories of people who love knitting, she drags us through her swatch fetish. Also, most of the stories are of knitters in the Northeast and in California. The stories were good, for the most part, but I was very disappointed that Nargi's major focus is on other urban knitters. Your grandmother isn't the only one who knits anymore, but neither is knitting the sole purview of hip urban artists. The book would have been better with more stories of other knitters, and far less of Nargi's personal story."
1,What a waste...,"Lela Nargi doesn't know what she's talking about - and that comes through loud and clear in this book. She doesn't know how to knit or even what knitting is. She frequently refers to knitting as making knots -- and it's not that at all. She doesn't know anything about the yarns as they should be used. I read this book to the end because I had spent money on it -- but I was so frustrated with the author by the end that I was grinding my teeth. Fortunately, tossing the book where it won't be found again and a few minutes of knitting quickly calmed me."
5,perfect bed,"i bought this bed for my little sister last year for christmas. it is heavy, but so very nice and durable. not a fake 100$ thing you can buy at walmart. this bed will last her many years to come."
1,Letters fall out when you go to hang up,"This is a very nice looking sign, but the white letters they send along are to small and don't stay in the grooves. I had to super glue in each letter so they would stay in place once I hang it up."
1,Very poor quality,This sign was in a window that faces the morning sun. Within one month the colors had faded and the letters started falling out. It was returned for a full refund. I was very satisfied with the service I received when I had to return it.
3,Nice looking sign,My only complaint is that the letters don't hold securely to the board. I had to use a light glue to hold them in place or they fall out from the movement of the door.
4,display,i have them on display in my room...they r totally beautiful and i get complements all the time!! And i use them sumtimes...they r perfect but the handle cover could have been better
1,Massage for Relaxation,"This is the first time I was so inspired to take the time to write a review of any kind.Please do not take my brevity as insincerity.I recommend you NOT waste you money on this video. Besides the poor production quality, the information it presents is very much lacking and in some cases illustrates technique that is not indicated for good health.There are other fine massge videos that Amazon offers. If you are looking for tips for massage techniques that promote relaxation. I suggest the Esalen video."
5,Zoo Med Reptile Shelter,"This is a must for Leopard Gecko owners. It is the perfect humid hide. I have had no problems with cracking, and it stays over the hot spot of the tub. The small size will be good up to 40 grams. I suggest purchasing the medium for 45 grams and up. It is heavy, so it is not moved around. You can use moist paper towels or moss for the substrate. It will hold the moisture longer than Tupperware hides.This is an update: These will not hold up to heat. If this is placed on the hot side of tank, they will crack and fall apart. Wish I had known this before I bought six ):"
4,Too Small,"I have a normal generic leopard gecko 1 year old female that is 6 inches long. From other customer reviews I thought this product would be perfect. I immediately noticed the hole was really small. My leopard gecko can barely fit her head through the opening and cannot move freely inside.I rate this product a 4 because the hide loosely fits together and can be easily knocked off from herps getting in and out. other than that, this hide would be ferfect for anoles, very small snakes, and baby geckos."
3,Hole very small,"I like the concept and wish it would work for my leopard gecko, but the truth is, the opening to get in it is just too small for my adult leopard gecko to get in there. :( The product would work well with other reptiles, but not adult leopard geckos. If the hole was a tad bigger, I'd give a 5 star."
1,Know what you are buying!!!,"If you are looking for a CD that basically incorporates sounds of a person's heartbeat with a lot of shushing sounds, and very faint female light vocals in the background (not actual words - just sounds) - then this is the CD for you. I did not expect this when I bought it. In my opinion, it was not very relaxing, my baby still screamed his head off and it really didn't help much. I had serious issues with colic and honestly the only things that helped were the books, ""Secrets of the Baby Whisperer"" and ""The Happiest Baby on the Block"". If you are looking for a good bedtime CD - I would go with First Whispers Sleeptime Edition."
3,interesting,"bought used and shipped quick. Perfect condition. Had a yard sale sticker on the case for a price cheaper than i paid for it though :/ A lot cheaper. Overall, cant wait to use it and see what baby thinks. It put me to sleep pretty fast. haha!"
3,"good cd, but didn't work for my child","I thought this cd was good and enjoyed listening to it, but did not work with my child. Still good cd, though."
3,Decent Thompson Novel,"CROPPER'S CABIN concerns Tom Carver, the adopted son of a poor sharecropper in Oklahoma. Tom gets involved with the wealthy daughter of a neighboring American Indian. When the father ends up dead, Tom becomes the prime suspect. How will Tom get himself out of this predicament? The book has it's share of twists and turns, some of which are not entirely believable.I'm a huge fan of the writings of Jim Thompson. CROPPER'S CABIN is clearly not one of his best offerings; Thompson's novels fall into several strata. If you've never read one of his books, start with one of his acknowledged crime noir masterpieces, such as THE GRIFTERS, THE GETAWAY, or POP. 1280. This novel is more for completists, although it has it's own kicky appeal."
4,Good Jim Thompson novel that gets an undeserved bad rap,"I love Jim Thompson's novels and have read twenty-one of the twenty-nine he wrote. Cropper's Cabin is definitely not his best, but it's also far from his worst. It's three-and-a-half stars worth of good and delivers the usual crime, lust, brutality and backwoods humor the author was known for. Don't know why some folks give it a bad rap; I wish I hadn't listened to the naysayers and put off reading it for years.The only caveat is I don't recommend starting with Cropper's Cabin if you're new to Thompson. However, there's no reason why you should stay away from it once you get a taste for the author's style."
2,Only For the Die Hard!,"Cropper's Cabin suggests ""Cut Rate Caldwell"" And ""Fire Sale Faulkner,"" writes Robert Polito in his Thompson bio Savage Art. Unfortunately he is right.... I found Cropper's Cabin derivative and generally misconcieved-- cardboard cutout characters and cliches. At any rate, I still enjoyed the book but I would definitely describe myself as a Thompson fanatic, and even his worst stuff is still fun and readable. If you are familiar with Thompson, you know that his work is pretty much hit or miss. Cropper's Cabin....well-- its a miss. too bad"
1,Only buy this for a seventh grader learning how to play basketball,"This DVD was COMPELTELY misrepresented as it appeared from the listing to be similar to the ULTIMATE JORDAN DVD set where it covers MJ's college and pro career with highlights and in-depth interviews etc. But this DVD is just Isaih Thomas in a gym with a home video camera filming some VERY basic instruction on the fundamentals of the game (like how to make a chest pass). The cover on this DVD actually says ""Isiah's Best Plays"" although there is not a single highlight from his career on this video. So don't be confused by the marketing here only buy this for a seventh grader learning how to play basketball"
2,Sloppy,"If this is a required text, as it was for me then buy it. The information isnt bad, and gives a good coverage of the subject, but the errata list I receieved from my professor spanned at least 20 pages, front and back. You'll learn controls with the right professor, but expect the book to confuse you with changing subscripts, even changing values in example problems. For example, the area of a wing in one example problem is listed as 945 ft^2 and yet the problem solves using the area of 965 ft^2. Equations will be missing subscripts entirely, or duplicate them. For example, in one end of the chapter section of problems, the 2-D coefficient of lift for the tail is listed twice as opposed to giving you one value for the tail, and another for the wing as they should have. Expect to make assumptions like they have never been made before either. So much will not be given to you, it will be up to you to decide what value is reasonable that youll use. Good luck to you if this is a required text."
5,What more could you ask?,"Virtual stimulations, artifical intelligence, Special Agents, high-tech bio terrorism. The future is a mixture of horrors and delights. One of these horrors is Arabella, also known as Infectress, smart and sexy, she has the answer to Earth's overpopulation problem. Kill 98% of mankind. But dreaming up a supervirus and designing a supervirus are two different things.For that she needs help.Scott McMichaels has made a delight, the world's first true artifical intelligence named META, who likes dirty limericks.But META only obeys and protects the interests of his maker.So, the fate of humanity depends on Scott's ability to resist whatever Infectress can throw at him in her programmed Hell. If he gives up mankind is doomed."
4,Great conversion of an old Atari game,This is a great conversion of the original Atari 2600 game from 1983. The graphics are better but the same addictive game play is there. And the price is good too for a new GameBoy Color cart. A password system lets you pick up a game where you left off previously rather than starting from scratch.
2,Stuck In A Time Warp,"While this is a more satsifying work than the dreadful ""Book Of Lies"", what puzzles me most is why the author set the story in the early 90's in the first place? Because of that, the story lacks the emotional impact it might have had if it had been written at that time. I've read it before, I've seen it before (""Longtime Companion"", for example)...I've lived it! Since then, something called combination therapies have exploded on the scene, drastically reducing the number of AIDS deaths. I keep wondering what a different spin the story would have taken if he had set it just as protease inhibitors were being introduced.. and the impact it had on the couple once readying for death now being given a chance to prolong their life together."
5,Nuveen Basilis,"I thought the book was great. I like having one comprehensive ""go-to"" for questions that come up in the confusing area of pleasure when kids, jobs, husband all seem to be at odds with it! I really enjoyed the chapters that focused on the emotional and relationship health side of things. The information about sexual empowerment was also a must for anyone who feels as though breast-feeding and exhaustion have brought this side of your life to an end. An excellent resource."
5,Artist as a critic,"Very fascinating, I've read bios on the case for a college thesis, but never the ""actual transcripts."" Highly recommend if a fan or not."
4,Not a book for everyone,"I read this book for a High School project and enjoyed most of it. Considering that I have been a fan of ancient mythology for several years I can really appreciate the different perspectives of this book and how Barth takes into account the different circumstances of each myth.It was fun and intriguing most of the time, but I found it also very confusing at parts. Barth had a tendency to go off on a tangent at certain parts of the novel and I was found trying to decipher several passages. Though I enjoyed his unique view of how things happened and I enjoyed how he made the myths playout much like a modern day screenplay I was also lost in the verbose detours that he took in the midst of these ebjoyable portions.So like I said, and enjoyable book, but not for everyone. Especially if you get lost easily in twisted"
1,Very disappointed,"Have never left negative feedback before, but this book was so heavily marked, that I can't read it...Packaging was nice, though..."
3,grotto songs,"picked this up today at a record show just on the strength of Kristin's more 'rock' things.what you DO get on this disc are Kristin's, as always, inspiring vocals and crusty lyrics, however, each songis accompanied only by plain acoustic guitar, very nice, but, nothing overly engaging with an occasional piano shade or violin."
3,Good but not great,"Allyn is a solid mystery writer. His heroine is very engaging. But the story here didn't seem to me to be up to his standards. I liked ""Black Water"" and ""Welcome to Wolf County"" much better. He does include some quotable quotes though (I collect them):Protection? I'd be safer dancing Swan Lake in a buffalo stampede. page 191`You look a little drawn,"" he said. `I feel drawn. By an artist with a broken arm.' page 193."
3,Somewhat instructional DVD,"DVD was ok, but not that much of an 'Instructional program'. It is more of a story of Joe's life. Portions of the DVD were instructional and other areas dealt with the player's life history. Let's say -- It was not the program I expected. If you are a fan of Joe Dumar's you will probably well satisfied."
5,Great Product,"I bought this for my grad-school group to bind our papers; it works fantastic and does a much better bind then a ""comebind"". I highly recommend this binder; it is also smaller than most binders so it is portable. The device its self is half plastic and half metal. It does feel like it could break ""if overloaded"". I do 4 sheets at a time or 1 plastic sheet at a time. I've done about 100 sheets total and it hasn't broke, meets my specs very well. The video that someone posted is a very good example of how this works."
2,disappointing,"Okay, making bound documents for the kid's school projects at home is good and so this thing is good for home use but it is NOT good for any sort of commercial use.I bought it to use in my classroom and it is essentially useless. If you punch more than two sheets of paper at a time, it breaks. In fact, the first time I used it the stupid thing broke and I had to return it for a new one. As a system, it works but just barely. There have got to be better quality systems out there...this one is cheap, plastic junk. Don't buy it."
2,"Nice-looking binding, but.......","I was going to buy one of these machines, but fortunately it wasn't in stock at the time. I really like the way it looks---better than comb binding. So, I bought one of their kits. You can manually make two documents with 50 prepunched pages, covers & spines . I played with the plastic spines and found that they pop open easily, and they can also break if you bend them while manually placing the paper on the rings.I'm not really happy with the way the comb binding looks, but it's a tried & true system, with lots of supplies available, including the capability of printing the title on the comb. Guess I'll comb bind my book or have it printed & bound somewhere."
4,"Expensive, but does the job","I purchased this hook and loop attachment to go with my 7424XP polisher. The attachment is good quality, but I think that the price is high, and Porter Cable should include the hook and loop attachment with the their polishers."
4,works as advertised.,this product mates up to the porter cable buffer as it should. hopefully one will be all i ever need.
1,NOT HAPPY,"Bought this and after 2 hours of use the bolt, that attaches the pad to the tool, came loose!Not sure why, will have to take it and see if the threads are saveable. the threads on the tool are OK. My first guessis that the attaching bolt is made of an inferior metal.The pad that I replaced lasted 3-4 years with serious fiberglass grinding/sanding"
3,Mixed Bag,"I bought this to replace a damaged vinyl copy and I am semi-satisfied. I personally really like the tracks on this album but to be fair, I am a trumpet player and big BS&T; fan. This is not their best but it is a fun album. The playing is excellent as usual. The BS&T; version of Ride Captain Ride is the cat's pajamas.I am no audiophile BUT like other reviewers mentioned, the quality of the this CD issue leaves much to be desired. If you have the equipment (or a kind friend) then rip it from the original vinyl onto your computer. I can still rock out to this CD, but the vinyl on this one is noticeably better and I was disappointed in this reissue.4 stars for the original recording and 2 stars for the CD for an average of 3."
1,Low fidelity sound quality and two good songs.,"""Got to get you into my life"" and ""Ride Captain Ride"" make great singles, but even they sound terrible on this pathetic ""remixing.""I understand why so many people hate the deceitful and greedy recording industry when they pawn trash like this."
3,New City It Was Not,"This album has David Clayton Thomas returning to BS&T;, and not for the better. No Sweat and New Blood demonstrated an evolution towards a jazz-rock fusion that was a brilliant direction, with infusion from the North Texas State alums who joined the lineup for those albums. DCT's return pushed the band in a rock direction that was neither polished nor successful, and the band never recovered from it, even it did continue to deliver a few more albums and tour.New City is for those who are dedicated fans, which I am, but this album marked the beginning of the end for what I saw as one of the big rock groups of the seventies."
4,deep-cleaning and durability,this cleaner is based on the classic eureka models made since the fifties and the current sanitaire commercial heavy-duty vacs. these offer some of the best deep-cleaning action available with easy to get parts if service should be necessary. if you have heavy traffic with dense carpet nap this is what is needed to get it clean. much lighter than most all tools-on-board machines and certainly more effective! cleaners of this type can provide daily service for decades!
3,This is supposed to be the best available on the market?,"Much over-hype in the media and other reviews caused me to purchase the TBF 582. The instructions tell you to weigh yourself barefoot and 3hrs after rising and eating a meal - - what am I supposed to do, come home for lunch and weigh myself before eating a sandwhich?The scale is not well balanced. You cannot step on it until it resets itself and more often than not, I tip the scale over when I put one foot on and try for the other. The glass makes the unit very slippery, especially in bare feet.Looks to me that this is not a very practical or properly engineered product. I certainly would not let any elderly person use it without holding on to them."
5,Scale is great...Amazon is questionable.,"I ordered this scale while it was on sale for $39.99, which is a great deal. Unfortunately, what I received was an open-box item. All of the contents were present and the scale has worked just fine for the few weeks I've used it, but I'm disappointed in Amazon for not disclosing that I was purchasing an item that was previously owned.As for the scale, I love it. Looks great and easy to operate the controls. Some reviewers mentioned the danger of tipping. I purposely attempted to tip the scale by stepping near the edge and sure enough, it tipped. But, during regular use, when I step on the scale it does not tip. This is true for me (140 lbs.) as well as my fiance at 230 lbs.I recommend this, but make sure it's not an open-box item!"
4,An Inspiring Love Story For All,"This is such a captivating love story that the issue of whether the subject is gay is not the essence of the passion. I admit that I do love biographies, and it is amazing how many informative details are contained in this adventure, which was Colin Turnbull's fascinating life. Colin Turnbull came in contact with so many varied people. Nonetheless, the story is hard to put down, as it moves so seamlessly from one experience to the next. Although I knew nothing about the Mbuti, the Ik, nor the steps to be taken to become a Buddhist monk before this exposure, Turnbull's affection for these cultures serves as a fascinating introduction. Like the Bushman story Colin loved to tell, it seems that this man should be content with a life well spent. Unlike most biographies, the reader is left inspired to follow one's own life passions to seek similar satisfaction."
3,informative yet rather strange,"This is an informative biography, no question on that, but one wonders what the relationship was between the author, Roy Grinker, and his subject, Colin Turnbull. Both did doctorates in anthropology at Harvard, and both studied the same peoples in Africa (does getting a PhD in anthropology absolutely necessitate studying pygmies in Afriac? sure seems like it...). From what I've read in other sources, Grinker turned his back on Turnbull's ""approach"" to pygmie culture, only to regret this after Turnbull's death. One wonders whether or not this book is a too-late tribute to the author's academic father-figure."
3,deception,"I've found Taras Bulba extremely beautiful. But Rasputin is not what I expected. However, the product worth because of the first item."
3,"Good product, customer service of seller is so so","This yoga mat so far has been good, it doesn't slip and has a nice thickness and minimal mat smell to it.The only complaint I have is that the color was different from what was pictured and ordered which was lime green. What I received was a darkish forest green color. When I asked to exchange it the seller wouldn't pay for shipping costs even though it wasn't as advertised. And when I emailed to inquire further they didn't respond. So I just kept it."
2,So hum...,"So these people are called Assuck and they don't suck ass.What is up with that dude?Well i think that is amazing cause usually when there is a band that has the word suck in it.It usually does.So get this cd if you want,you might like it."
2,Mug Tree,This was a very light weight piece. One of the pegs snapped when we inserted it into the base. The pegs were very clsoe together--did not have enough room to hang large cups.
4,Mug Tree Review,This is a perfectly functional mug tree. The only one drawback is that it works better with small and medium sized mugs but not so well with larger mugs. I received it promptly and in perfect condition. The assembly was a cinch.
1,"It's Cheap, so you know...","It's Cheap, so, you know the quality is: so so. We had this for just about two months, and one of the branch is loose already. The branch is very short, so it has the hazard of having the mug dropping down. I would not recommend buying this."
4,A Good Basic,"This mug tree is a sturdy basic for any kitchen. It's solid and functional and well spaced. For the money, I would prefer to see a little less functionality and a few more decorative touches or even different finish options (cherry finish would be great).But you get what you pay for."
3,It serves its function,"When I received this item, some parts of the wood already broken but it's really doesn't worth the effort to send it back and wait for another one. I managed to glue the broken parts back and now it works ok."
1,Dreadful,"As usual another Wheeler downer, reflecting the superficial research available from incomprehension of the secondary sources. I. E. Literary theft, without much cerebration about what it signifies, put politely.Why not read Bob De Arment's Masterson instead and avoid all of the saccharine baloney.A book for the mentally uncomplciated. To them I highly recommend it. It beats reading labels on cans of beans. But that's about the size of it in this reader's opinion. I confess that I didn't read the entire book, having been endowed with a sense of self preservation."
4,Much fun!,"I read this years ago and enjoyed every minute of it. It's not Great Literature, but it's a delightful piece of entertainment. (And it's been long enough since I read it that I don't recall the details, so maybe a reread is in order.)"
5,overwhelming,"Liesbeth List is easy to fall in love with--perused her wares at the Antwerp FNAC, and she had me at 'Rotterdam'. No wait!"
5,Absolutely love it!,"My 10 month old had been sleeping with my husband and I since he was born. I decided it was too dangerous to keep him in there now that he is so mobil, so he had to move into his crib for good. This CD was just what he needed. The sound of a heartbeat interlaced with soft music was the perfect combination to help him feel secure and relaxed."
5,I recommend Transitions 2 CD.,I love Transitions 2 and Maternal Love CD's! I don't have an overly fussy baby but these CD's make sleep time so easy.The first time I played Maternal Love my baby fell asleep within seconds! Transitions 2 is another version of Maternal Love just a little different but my baby becomes so relaxed listening to it and I become very relaxed as well. Most times we are both falling asleep together. I highly recommend for babies and parents. Both are absolute gems can't stop telling other parents about them!
5,Very pleasant purchase!!,"I was initially very skeptical to purchase this item considering the cost of it thinking how can one sell an item in good working condition for so less. But when I received my CD, it was in a great condition then I downloaded it to my iTunes, no problem - synched to my iPad, iPhone and iPod, no problem and plays like charm. This was the first time I was ever buying a used product for such a less price on Amazon and I'm very happy that I did this transaction. Why waste money?? I would definitely check out this seller once for any future purchases."
2,Didn't help my babies sleep,I've tried this with 2 babies and they both seem oblivious to it. I wonder if the heartbeat were louder and the music was the background if that would be more effective.
3,A classic on training games,"The first volume in a series of group training development games. Although very basic in instruction and content, this book does provide a number of very good activities designed for team building and team learning experiences. If you are familiar with other works by J. William Pfeiffer, this book is a must for your training and development library."
5,"Excellent biography, look forward to learning more","This biography is extremely well written; I haven't read one this good since ""Captain Sir Richard Burton."" The biography covers equally Greece's history from 1900-1970 and Seferis' Nobel-prizing winning body of poetry. The descriptions are vivid and the reader gets a complete sense of Seferis as statesman and artist. Although Seferis was not prolific, the author stresses the quality of his work and its timeliness during a tumultuous period for Greece, indeed the world.The description of Skala is evocative of Odysseus's Ithaca and resonates profoundly throughout Serferis' story. The poetic analysis is well-resoned, although my only suggestion for the next edition of this biography is an appendix of his best poems."
3,Colorings and Flavorings,"Yes, it's great that it's in a readily available form: Methylcobalamin. Yes, it's great that it's sublingual since pill forms that go thru the gut lose up to 90% of their effectiveness. Yes, it's in a 1000mcg size.The only problem is...it's a terrible, ""childrens"" cherry flavor. And pink to boot. When you put it under your tongue it will turn your teeth pink..and later on, your toothbrush. I hate any unnecessary colors, though the bottle makes no mention whatsoever of colorings or flavorings.I would much prefer a natural color. Maybe the taste was such that it had to be covered up, but can't they do better than explosive kiddie CHERRY?I will look for something different next time."
3,Not a bad vitamin,"I like to consider myself a pretty thorough researcher before I buy vitamins; and this one was no exception. These did provide the necessary mcg needed, and worked fine for my family. No complaints with regard to taste and absorbed quickly. A real plus was that these contain no artificial preservatives, color or sweeteners; no corn, soy, starch, wheat or yeast. A real plus for vegetarians (or anyone) needing B-12."
1,Not for vegans: contains lactose from milk,"I purchased this product because I follow a vegan diet (consuming no animal-based products), and thus needed a source of B12. However, the product contains lactose from milk, and is therefore not a vegan product."
1,I have a healthy heart & this makes it ache,"I ordered 2 bottles & threw them away after I realized taking it made my heart hurt. I don't have any heart issues (I'm 45, fit & healthy). I'll stick to GNC or Nature's made for now on. I have used both of these Brands with great results and NO side effects. Be careful with this one. I would NOT recommend!"
2,"Definition of ""wood"" is suspect","""Beautiful deluxe wooden Crokinole game"" is a poor description of this high-density CARDBOARDgame on which a woodgrain applique has been applied. The only wood in this game is the playingdiscs. The bumpers are medium density fiberboard and mine game came shipped with practicallyno protection inside. As a result, it had a badly damaged corner straight out of the box.The pegs are plastic and are somehow glued into the darker cardboard backer. Mine were damaged(?in transit?) and quite loose (no way to tighten them appears possible).Amazon.com did a very nice job of refunding my money, but buyer beware: The pictures on theweb look much nicer than the actual product. The actual product looks only marginally better thanthe surface of a Monopoly board."
3,Folly of a Series,"As one previous reviewer stated, the author, Roberta Gellis, refers to Magdalene as a whore about 5 times per page. It is also the never-ending obsession of the main male protagonist Sir Bellamy, which I guess is a reflection of the times of 12th century England. However, the whole whore issue gets old fast. Otherwise, it remains an interesting series of books. I have not completed the book yet, but am enjoying reading it. I am rather happy that I bought the book used and not new, as Roberta Gellis publishes on demand (POD) at the cost of over $80.00 per book! I say ""Recycle, reuse and save a dime all at the same time!"""
4,Classy General Survey,"Shambhala Library books are beautiful.They are well bound, researched, and translated as appropriate.My favorites are usually specific titles, rather than general ones.This book is a general survey of erotic poetry that will likely haveat least one poem worth the price of the book for any given literate reader - at least one poem that that resounds in the senses, emotions and thoughts.Two of my favorite new poets, thanks to this book:Juana Ines De La CruzLi Ch'ing-chaoThe reason for a four star review is this book isn't comprehensive."
5,NO BLOOD FOR OIL,"This poet organized the Poets for Peace day and Washington, DC. His poetry is saccarine and stolid, but he has great organizational ability."
3,the erotic spirit in ALL its forms????,"This anthology is good but one thing that bothers me deeply is that it is ""homophobic""--it includes work by Whitman, Dickinson, Sappho, Shakespeare, Adrienne Rich, Olga Broumas, Lorca but all selections of gay and lesbian poets, known and not so, even the notes on the authors, have been ""neutered"". This I find very strange today for an anthology that claims to be about ""the erotic spirit in all its forms"". Sam Hamill, you have really disappointed me--I thought you were more open-minded than that!"
4,nice but doesnt fitmy car,"This is a beautiful piece for the car. Unfortunately it doesnt fit my Lincoln LS. With that in mind, i only gave it a 4 star but if it would have fit, it would have been 5 for sure. Again, this is a nice looking accessory to any vehicle....if it fits."
4,viactive,I could not find Viactive calcium chewables in Raspberry- All the stores carry here is Caramel or Milk Chocolate. Raspberry is the best tasting chewable. It is very soft and easily digestible. I was very happy to purchase this product through Amazon.com.
1,Caramel flavor is VERY hard to unwrap!!!,"These taste fine but they are way too soft and sticky, so unwrapping them is an ordeal. A lot of the product sticks to the wrapper and gets thrown away, and your fingers end up very sticky too. I may try storing them in the fridge to see if that helps. (Although I do not live in a hot area so it isn't as if the room temperature is warm to begin with.) I've tried generic / off brands in the past and those were great and did not have this problem at all."
5,If you need calcium carbonate for renal insufficiency,"This product is a godsend for parents of children with renal insufficiency. It is a tasty form of calcium carbonate that binds phosphate - much better than trying to grind up Tums, etc."
1,New is NOT always improved...,"I had been buying Viactiv for years and didn't even think twice about the new package. That is until I was told by my Dr. that I have a mild blood disorder, one that is pretty common in fact, and he told me to check my supplements for Vitamin K. Sure enough there it was and now I can no longer take them. If you have a clotting issue or are on any type of blood thinner, even an aspirin a day you need to make sure your Dr. knows that you are taking extra vitamin K!! The sad part is they have done this to the whole calcium product line so I can't even switch within their product line. Quite a huge disappointment."
3,Good flavor,"Because I live in a rural area, it is hard to find this flavor of Viactive. Being able to order it is great, HOWEVER, the shipping of this item costs almost as much as the product since it does not qualify for free shipping. I will look for this flavor elsewhere and make sure I stock up."
3,"good, but...",These give me a sour belly when i take them. I don't knwo why. But they do taste good. So...
1,Who whould put trans fat in a vitamin?,"After reading the ingredients, it because apparent that there is trans fat in these vitamins via the hydrogenated coconut oil. Buyer beware."
2,No shelf life,"I purchased two a while back. One I installed promptly and used for about a year. Note, this was used in a busier than average home environment, not a commercial shop, so intermittent use is accurate. The other pad sat in a cabinet waiting for it's time. After about a year and half, it's time came... and it blew apart almost instantly. The pad I had been using also blew apart, which is why I went to replace it.I have dewalt, makita and other sanders, so I feel I have a good baseline on what to expect.This pad may have it's use, but I'll try another brand if I find a need for a contour pad again. Just sayin'..."
2,Crazy Again,"Throwing Muses shares more than a title with their eponymous debut. It's just as scattershot and disjointed as that overrated classic. I enjoyed Kristen Hersh's commercial struggle on House Tornado and The Real Ramona: she wanted the pop market to kowtow to her freaky fragmentation. The fight ended a thrilling draw. Before that, she didn't seem merely unhinged or abrasively inspired: she sounded crazy. There are times when the thrashing time changes and trilling rants work: ""Civil Disobedience"" creates meaning from its abrupt rhythms since the song's about defiance. ""Pandora's Box"" strums its seductive melody into a neo-blues once the evil box is opened. They make sense. Otherwise, the tracks - though well played - feel arbitrary; a ... band playing with intricate tempos because they can. The best thing I can say about Throwing Muses is that it gets better the more you play it. The worst it that, now that I've written this review, I'm not going to play it all that much."
2,not what i hoped,"I almost had a heart attack when I saw this and The Grotto on the shelf. I did not hesitate to buy both, but I have to admit I was disappointed. It just didn't hook and haunt me like the others, such as The Real Ramona and Limbo.I have no idea what another reviewer means by urging listeners to never read to lyrics while listening to a CD. HUH??? I usually don't really like a CD that much until I read the lyrics. Being a poetic person, the words draw me in. I tend to feel a bit cheated when a CD doesn't contain lyrics.Maybe if I find the lyrics on the net, I will grow to like the CD more."
4,"A sequel to ""Time""... a ""World"" of wonder.","His 3rd album for W.H. is an obvious sequel to Citizen of Time ( his 3rd album for Narada), and Mr. Arkenstone has done it again. I believe his best is still yet to come (which is why I only gave this album 4 stars) and ""world music"" is really not his forte- which is probibly why the more ""cinematic"" pieces like Safe Passage, Ceremony, Pharohs, and Dreamtime seem to stand out as typical, familiar and,of course, classic Arkensound. Still, a fine piece of music-making and sound-designing overall. D.Ark is still my alltimefavorite- followed, ever so closely, be Vangelis...which is darn good company for Dave to be in. Duke Wally Mondo sez =)"
5,"One of his best CD, If not the best Itself",Take a journey around the world and listen to many different types of musical influence. Close your eyes and escape.
4,A Worthy Recording,"This was recommended to me by my choir director who will be directing us in the Rheinberger Mass listed in this CD. Very good choral mix helps to accent the beauty in a mass that is not often heard. Known for his organ music, his extensive choral repitoir has often been overlooked. He is well worth checking out."
3,Does it's job sort of.,"For appearance sake the clip works, it clips into the gun and holds pellets, however either with my gun or with the several clips i've used with it, theres about 2-3 pellets that don't get caught in the gun and fall out when you go to reload, for how much it holds it's not that big a deal, but a small annoyance."
3,"Great premise and actors, yet falls a bit flat","This British film has some good actors and a great premise (which would be a spoiler to describe), and yet its muddled presentation prevents it from ever striking a chord - which is a great shame.Throughout the movie, an earnest and engaging young boy insists that he was once a rat. You can't help but believe him and indeed, what he says is true; that, and much more.Ironically, rather than being a movie about a rat who becomes a boy, the title character starts the film as a homeless boy taken in by a caring couple - but then through mishaps and betrayals, he encounters people that treat him more and more like a rat. Will he end up in a loving family, as a rat, or even exterminated?(It's a family film, so you can probably guess! ;)"
3,He was great 20 years ago; but he's changed,"In the early-mid '80s, I never missed APHC. There's no denying that Keillor possesses two gifts: a rare sense of humor, and that marvellous voice that was destined for radio.Unfortunately, with success came change; the same change that overcame Bill Cosby, turning his once-charming sitcom into a politically correct weekly lecture.Likewise, Keillor apparently decided that with his fame and fortune came the obligation to make the world a better place by spreading the good news of liberalism. Hence his tiresome attacks against Reagan, Bush, et al. The sad thing is that before he was overcome by this sense of his own importance, he WAS making the world a better place - with gentle humor, good music, and good talk. If only he had retained enough modesty to leave it at that."
2,25th Anniversary Collection a Disappointment,"Make no mistake about it-- the stories were not disappointing at all. What is misleading and lacking is the sense of a radio show. The music and connecting conversations were edited out. A ""music only"" CD was made in addition to the ""story"" CD. The ""collection"" therefore made the sum much less than its parts. Very disappointed in not getting a sample of the best shows."
3,I liked it,"But where normally it takes me a day to read a book this size, I've had this one about a week and a half. Almost every page was ear-marked because I couldn't stay with it to get interested. Toward the end, it got good. It should have had more ""up front"" so a reader would be tempted to finish it!"
3,aint that firme,iight so he aint the best of da best but ey he got some firme flows in his rollas if he had a better sounding vocie i think i would like him more but his cd is iight i mean i bought n all but it aint as good as i thought if he does come oput with another cd i think i would buy that one hopefully it will be betta
4,As Advertised And Described,What can I say? It works great with my hook and loop set-up on my Porter Cable polisher. Worth the money and it is lasting a long time with normal use. I will buy again.
4,Works well,Bought this time polish wax on furniture using a random orbital sander. Works great in this task. Worried about how it will stand up when I try to wash it.
1,Another piece of [stuff] from Porter-Cable,"Porter-Cable makes bad accesories for their polisher, i washed the pad the the adhesive turned hard, theis makes polishing grinding. ""The fine lambs wool polishes without harming the surface finish."" what a load..... how can you wash the old wax off."
4,Excellent Tool,Bible Study is a rewarding task made pleasurable by having the right tools to assist in the task. Rotherham's is a such a tool which makes understanding the scriptures an easier task as one tries to grasp the nuances of the culture and language of the times in which the scriptures were penned and compiled.
3,Very Good Next To The NWT,"This version of the Bible is an excellent translation for its day and age. A very fine point is the restoration of the Divine Name - Yahweh or Jehovah - to its rightful place in the Hebrew Scriptures! Also the correct translation of ""presence"" instead of ""coming"" in some of the verses of Matthew 24 and 2 Peter 3 is welcome as is the correct use of ""gehenna"" and ""hades"" over ""hellfire"". This is a vast improvement over the usual versions used in the 1800s and up until our day.Next to the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, produced by the Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society of Pennsylvania, I find this to be a fine edition for one to have in their library."
1,DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!,"This game is the worst game i have ever played on Gameboy! It's confusing,boring, and stupid, with bad graphics. Don't waste your money on this game! There are much better games out there!"
3,Who wants to be a Detective?,"It's not a game to be going all crazy about, but It's fun to play. Yes, the graphics are great, I have to give em credit for that. But, you're pretty much running all over the place, and the sense of humor is there. But, ya gotta keep a sharp head and think straight, eventhough you have amnesia which allows your physical ability to be at a minimal. For you thinkers out there with a sharp head, this game would be for you. It's fun and interesting. You also have the ability to carry many things you need and discard things you don't need. This game will keep you going for you money. Try it out."
4,A Nintendo Classic,"Deja Vu was one of my favorite games for NES, and I'm so glad it's now available for gameboy. It is a little tough to figure out, but then again, most detective games are. I consider this game to be a classic, right up there with Castlevania and Shadowgate, though it is not as well known. I honestly liked it better than Shadowgate, but that's just my personal taste. I think most people would enjoy this game...."
2,Don't get too excited...,"I was very excited when I purchased this game. All the others review say how this game is so amazing and perfect. At first look, I changed my mind. Repeated music, hard to control, and much more. Do yourself a favor and buy F-Zero instead."
5,Quality & Value,Lovely quality glass in a classic shape made for decanting your favorite wines. Value is great for the price.
1,the gift of magi,was a great story we saw it a few yrears back and ordered one for ourself BUT!!!!! it was a in subtitles we sent it back still looking for the one in english
3,"a made for tv opera, ok - not great","The production is fine, the images clear and the sets nicely done, the music clear. It is sung in Finnish with English subtitles. It tells the story, but the ratio of singing to images is off. There is very little vocal music relative to the story and this seems strange for an opera. It may be excessive sensitivity but to me the character of Mr Salomon seems stereotypically Jewish -- long nose, etc. I find that this use of a historic and unflattering sterotype bothersome."
3,Edit this book please!!,"I had difficulty finishing this book. At times I could not put it down and at times I could hardly keep reading it. It is like a compilation of several books by several authors, each one not conferring with the other in order to harmonize the content. Making ""God's Word in our hands"" more concise would make it much more interesting.The authors have the same plea, that brethren fully understand the bible version issue, and that they show love and tolerance for those who have a different opinion than their own. The latter being much more important than the former."
4,"Solid foundation, shaky building","The first 162 pages of this book are great. Steele could spin them off into a short textbook. The explanations of antibody diversity, gene rearrangement and hypermutation are really very good. The rest is a little hard to believe, and where the immune system is concerned doesn't even make sense. Adaptability and variability, not hard-coding, are key to the immune response, so it seems that what he proposes--that learned responses could be passed back into germ-line DNA--wouldn't even be benficial if it were to turn out to be true considering the rate at which most pathogens mutate. But, let the experts address that question. For an overview of antibody production, this is done well."
4,Kudos (mostly),"I bought this book because I am a former minister who is struggling mightily with issues of faith and doubt. I found it to be refreshing and--in some ways--astounding. Too often, anyone who harbors intellectual doubts or leaves the faith is said to be putting up a ""smoke screen"" to cover some kind of moral failure or rebelliousness. Tucker, however, is exceedingly sympathetic to the doubter and refuses such easy dismissals. Her idea of ""doubting your doubts"" as well as your faith was thought-provoking. However, I would add that I was dismayed by her repeated assertions that she could never leave the faith herself. How could anyone write this book and make such a claim? If there is no possible evidence that would cause one to change their mind, then an honest search seems to be hamstrung at the get-go."
4,Useful Contemplation of Apostasy,"This book grew on me, likely at the first from one or two stars to four. The reason: as one gets to know the author and her intent with the writing, one senses a person truly one would enjoy sitting and conversing with. And this is exactly what Tucker has done with those who have walked away from the faith. More with stories and not with Scripture, but meaningful and useful nonetheless.She is honest and skilled in holding the reader's attention. Whether one agrees with all of her assesment or not, there is easily much to be gained from reading this familiarization with those who struggle to believe. That is salient point of this work: they truly do struggle to believe. Sometimes with differing results, but struggle they do. Tucker also provides helps on what the church can do to assist."
3,"This is an important book, but...","Books by George Barna, George Gallup Jr., et al., have reported on the millions of American Christian adults who have walked away from the Christian faith. But very few books in recent years have been addressed directly to these individuals who have experientially lost their faith. The most recent, Walking Away from Faith by Ruth Tucker (InterVarsity, 2002), offers an insightful analysis of their experiences, enriched with many anecdotal stories (including the author's own struggles). But in the end Tucker doesn't offer readers hope. This is an important book, but I can't recommend it."
1,Uncharacteristically poor service for Porter Cable,"The Porter Cable template guide failed right after I began using it with a brand new Porter Cable router bit, which I ordered at the same time as the template guide. Either the guide or the bit were defective as the guide developed small cracks, or splits almost immediately; the guide and the bit touched and I saw small sparks. Both the bit and the guide were ruined. BTW, I was using them in a Porter Cable router which I had used before and after the above happened, and have had no other problems with the router."
1,wrong parts,I order klein 601-6-inch insulatated cabnet and got klein 601-6 cabnet same screwdrive just not insulated you think someone would know the difference
2,Too little music!,"This is fun background music, but there's only 32 minutes of music. Even at nine dollars this isn't worth it. Use the money to buy dinner music that lasts through dinner."
4,"melodies, melodies, melodies","What a beautiful example of classic melodies being played by a live orchestra. Tasty, easy listening!"
2,No more than the title,"I was really interested in reading a book that promised to give a deep understanding on how to get people involvement and how to manage that process; also the authors' biographies were very promising.So I was really surprised and puzzled when reading page after page I could extract only generic advice (already known) and couldn't find anything useful, with some exception (see interview chapter XXII). Just reading the title is enough to get the message.Luckily, the companion book ""The Idea Generator: Quick & Easy Kaizen"" is much better."
1,I've read better books on this topic,This book did not provide any new information plus I did not like the writing style. It could have been down as a pamplet or even put on a poster. Several years ago I read a book by Jack Stack called The Great Game of Business that did a much better job.
5,Money well spent!,"Michael Tilson Thomas has been doing an incredible job with an incredible orchestra.Next time you have extra cash on hand please take into consideration the Keeping Score series first aired on PBS and available on DVD and Blue Ray.I'm somewhat baffled that after winning so many Emmys with these Malher CD performances this composer has not yet been taken into consideration on Keeping Score.If he ever decides to do it let's be the Third. There are many good recordings of this Symphony, Bernstein, Solti and Kubelick come to mind and this one stands with the best of them."
4,Good book,"This is good book, just much more thin than I had imagined. It is very informative, and covers a lot of the basics."
5,Dog book for everyone!,"Although designed for a child, any adult would enjoy this book, too. I bought it for a child's gift and it was received with enthusiasm."
2,seatbelts do not fit a kid,"This seat has seatbelts that when fully extended barely reach across the lap of the seat, but not around the kid!!! essentially you are looknig at modifying this seat belt for any sized kid."
1,Terrible swing,"I returned this swing immediately. I don't know how they consider this a ""toddler"" swing. My son is only 1 1/2, is very small for his age and the straps would not even go around his waist. I don't know how Step2 can claim this swing is for 1-3 yr olds. Between shipping rates, I still ended up paying $[...] for this swing after my refund."
2,Buy something else,"My 15 month old daughter hated this swing. It has shoulder straps and a lap belt to hold her in but the shoulder straps constantly cut into her neck on both sides causing her to want to slide down in the seat for more comfort and when she did, it hurt her neck and she wanted to get out right away. Also I didn't like the fact that there is no bar across the front for her to hang on to. I recommend you try another swing."
3,no way is this going to fit a 36 month old.,"I bought this swing to put on the new variety climber swing set extension that we just bought. My 7 month old and 22 month old fit perfectly in it. When my best friends 20 month old boy came over to try out the new play set he just bairly fit. He is not an overweight toddler, just tall and muscular. There is no way a bigger kid would fit. So I am going tomorrow to buy the little tykes high back toddler chair for our bigger guests. One really nice feature about this chair is that it has a 5 point harness belt. That is really comforting. I really feel that my babies are safe sitting in it."
2,Ropes are not weather-resistant,"I have had this swing for a year now and it is not usable at all. For the past 6 months, the rope has dried up so much that if you touch it you get splinters. I have had to wrap tape around it just to be able to use the rope to swing my child with or to let him touch. This swing may look good, but trust me it will not last at all!"
4,Always an important event in folk music.,"Rounders addicts will need no coaxing to purchase this, their best music since the legendary Prestige recordings of the early '60s. For the rest of you, get those first (now available on one import CD). Then buy this one.It's utterly delightful and mad music which taps deeply into the same wellspring of weirdness and joy found in the Harry Smith Anthology, Captain Beefheart or Charles Ives.More alt. than alt.country, more American than Americana. . .Let the Rounders bend your brain."
3,Death ends a life but not a relationship,"""Your Loved One Lives On Within You"" is a book of great hope and healing for people who have lost someone dear, yet feel there is much unfinished business.Using techniques such as the imagination and shamanic journeying, Kennedy gives the reader many options for handling unresolved grief and unresolved relationships. SHe also gives readers who had good relationships many possibilities for enriching them.No one technique can assuage all the grief that we feel when we lose people we love -- no matter how complicated or uncomplicated the relationship. But ""Your Loved One Lives On ..."" gives a solid foundation for moving through the grief process with resolution and optimism."
4,Amateur Opinion,"I ordered this because I heard it on the radio and liked it. Got it, listened to it, still like it very much. I'd never really paid much attention to Gounod before, but now find at least two of his compositions well worth hearing. Sorry I don't have the finesse to go into shrewd details, discussing whether or not the conductor in question is taking such-and-such a passage at the best tempo, and so on. ""I don't know music, but I know what I like."""
3,schizophrenic,"Just as Gounod himself careened between becoming a member of the clergy and a composer, his symphonies also veer - between late 18th century classical music and mid 19th century French romanticism, often in the same movement. While I find the idea of contrasting styles of interest, I can't help but feel that in these works Gounod presents us with the mediocre of each period. As the liner notes say, these are ""modest"" symphonies. How very kind."
5,A Compassionate Look at Adoption,"This is a book based on real life experiences. The author is an adoptive parent himself who recounts for the reader the emotions of an unwed mother and a childless couple, both before and after adoption takes place. It is a realistic look at the highs and lows of those involved in the process, the love at the center of giving and receiving the newborn, and the happy ending for all. Charmingly painted by the author from personal photographs, this is a wonderful book for children and adults alike, one of particular value to those adopting or considering adopting. A must read!"
4,Put your name on the marquee,"Rather thin letters but they do the job, at least you'll have all the letters you need at one time"
3,Too big!,"I bought these and they ended up being too big for the board I have. The script size was okay, however the actual letters/numbers/symbols did not fit in the groves of the board."
1,wrong size,"The wheel was marked 26 x 1 3/8 but is was definitely not, nor was it 27"" or 700 cm. I believe it was one of those odd Schwinn sizes, even the folks at the bike shop were stumped by it. Disappointing."
1,Darts are cool but.........,"I think darts are one of the coolest things. But putting them on a video game, now you just went toooooooo far. This was cool for me and my friends for an hour. We then fought over who was gonna pay the price for it."
2,junk,"I had to remove the built-in ruler, and using a square, I had to re-position this ruler so that it was actually ""square"" to the cutting blade. What good was this product if it did not cut square? Swingline must be outsourcing like much of America's Companies. What a shame too. Swingline use to be the very best you could buy. Not anymore! Keep searching...."
4,"almost, but not quite","Just like the old days it is an excellent cutter. I would have given 5 stars but the ruler is not straight. So the closer you get to the 18 inches the more off the cut. It is not glaringly off, but this means it can't be used for precision cutting. Which is a real shame for this price. I notice another reviewer was handy enough to fix this himself- but no one should have to."
4,good for basic knowledge but not for advance,"This book is good for the beginners who need to understand the basic principle of communications. The basic matlab source will be usefull to understand the concept. But this book doesnot good for advance reserach. we can not find any detail principle of OFDM, CDMA or other multiple access technique that are better and close to the application. Therefore, this book may be (only) better for the undergraduate student but not for advance wireless communications research."
1,Received Softcover and not Hardcover,I received a softcover version of the book from Amazon when I ordered the hardcover copy for $76.00.
4,Support Texas Local Music,"If you like this album, try to find Quick Biomic Arms. This album consist of 6 songs and every song of is fabulous."
5,"This band is phenomenal..if you like Hum, you'll love this.","This is passionate, heavy rock. There are two singers and both are very different, but it really adds to the sound. The album starts out with a bang and gradually ends on a lighter note. It definitely does remind me in some ways of Hum, but the vocals are far better and the changes in the songs make many of them like individual journies. I love it."
4,Portraits from a Chinese Scroll,"Consists of a series of chapters, each telling about a certain person in China -- an old scholar, merchant beggar, etc. Beautiful calligraphy by CHEN cHAO-MING"
5,Super easy!!,"Purchased the ProClick system to custom bind different things in the office (ie/ product/price guides, manuals, etc.). We are currently coil-binding but we need to re-do these quite often as information gets outdated quickly. This ProClick system allows for the pages to be punched and inserted like a binder and re-opened to replace/remove/add pages."
4,Imaginative!,"To see what will happen in the future, scientists usually assume that current trends will continue in the way they have until now. That is exactly what Warren Ellis has done. In the twisted future you see in Transmetropolitan, using makeup to change the look of your skin is for babys; everyone else changes not the look of their skin but their actual skin into looking like aliens from space! There are lots of people looking partly human, partly alien, permanently! Why? Because it's cool! Any use for it? Nope!There are lots of other wacky stuff in the world of Transmetropolitan, but why would I want to spoil the surprise?"
2,it's okay.,"This follows Spider Jerusalem, a journalist, who reports in a really messed up future, where people change themselves to look like aliens, the police are corrupt, and there are deformed cats walking around.The first issue is bad, but the last two are okay. As Spider returns to the city he interviews an old friend, who is leading some dumb cause, andlater on a riot breaks out in the streets.This is for adults only because every other word is a curse. Overall it's okay, but lacks something. I wouldn't suggest buying it unless you have [some] extra bucks lying around."
5,"Straddling offensive, funny, vulgar, insightful and thought provoking!","It takes a stroke of genius to straddle the line between offensive, funny, vulgar, insightful and thought provoking. The truly great thing about Transmet is that it manages to achieve this accolade without coming across as pretentious, preachy, self-important or indulgent. It embodies a sense of balance that is often missing from graphic novels.Transmet is a Sci-Fi book at heart, but its also so much more. Its a narrative on success, power, politics and the power of an unlikely (and reluctant) hero to set the world straight.I read a lot of these books. Transmet is my favorite by far. IMO, its Warren Ellis at his best. ...No, its more than that... Unnerving, honest and raw. This is literature at its best. Buy it. Now."
4,"I was sceptical, but became entrapped","I am not a reader of super hero comics, not that Transmetropolitan protagonistic 'Spider Jerusalum' is sold to us as a hero, or even antihero, but I was caught up in the story and futuristic world.After I managed to detach Spider from Hunter Thompson, I really began to enjoy the dark slapstick craziness. I won't recommend this as a piece of deep social analsys but rather a fun series for lovers of gallows humour.Don't look for depth or the academic. Just enjoy the ride!"
3,Not for everyone,"I just recently started reading graphic novels and I've been actively searching for some of the more critically acclaimed publications. I started with Preacher and Y: The Last Man. I found both extremely enjoyable -- fantastic art, intriguing stories, and always a healthy dose of humor.I had high hopes for the same in Transmetropolitan, but ultimately didn't get it. I can see the intelligence in the writing and potential in the central character (Spider), but the perpetual nihilism and references to strange and abstract futuristic concepts left me bored. It reminded me of the popular cyberpunk style of writing, which I never enjoyed either. So in a nutshell this one just wasn't a fit for my personal taste -- I gave up after the second volume. Three stars for the creative effort and strong artwork."
5,A Classic,"If you like gritty storylines and crazy philosophic characters this graphic novel is for you. It's a classic and if you haven't read it yet, you need to. Classic, but thoroughly modern and relevant."
2,A Great Disappointment,"I am crazy about Renee Fleming, admire Tennessee Williams, and can enjoy, say, Lulu -- so why did I dislike this so? The sets and cast look great; the acting is good enough. The fault, I suppose, lies primarily with the composer: he captures some of the desperation of Blanche, but not the (faded) beauty. Apparently, he wrote this part for Renee Fleming; but, for one thing, I would like to hear it sung more softly -- with slower tempos! Maybe there is vocal beauty here that this performance fails to capture because it doesn't let the music sufficiently ""breathe."" Renee Fleming has a wonderful melancholy look, which her at times almost Wagnerian vocalizing belies -- Isolde, fallen on hard times."
4,"Futral sizzles, Rene burns","I don't like Tennessee Williams...such dull, dreary characters. And much of Previn's music seems contrived. But the music and drama both go over the top when Futral seduces a seemingly stoic Gilfry...... the music is minimal, yet so sensuous. Futral sings so lightly, more like purring. Hot as it gets... Yet sex is not the end, only the means for control. As Futral approaches orgasmic intensity, Gilfry grins at Rene. He's got the power... and he's letting Rene know it........big time."
4,Wonderful modern opera,"I was really not sure from the previous reviews whether or not I would like this modern opera version of ""Streetcar Named Desire"". Personally, I just had to watch it because of the outstanding cast including Renee Fleming, Elizabeth Futral and Rodney Gilfry. Although there were moments when I longed for a beautiful aria instead of recitations, I did enjoy this opera. The cast were all in outstanding voice and Rodney Gilry has tremendous charisma. What a body too! Oh, there I go being superficial. He was perfect as the smirky, mean and arrogant Stanley. Fleming displays fragile and sensitive beauty in her portrayal of Blanche. Futral is lovely as the sweet Stella. I think the libretto could probably have been better written which is why I give it 4 stars. The music was lovely and the SF Orchestra is a perfect accompanist."
2,A Dissenting View,"I bought this opera and I believe that the reviews below are accurate in most senses. The scenery, orchestral playing, singing, and acting are all excellent, without exception. My objection is that this opera IS close to the original play and the original play is ambiguous and unpleasant. The music created to support the play is mostly atonal and unpleasant to my ear creating an experience that many people will want to avoid. So while well done, I would recommend caution in considering buying this tape."
2,Goldmine - not for single users,"If you have an inclination to buy this book, look at ACT! or MS Outlook instead of Goldmine. These books are written by Goldmine Certified Consultants. Do you really believe they are going to give their secrets away...when they charge thousands a day?You will find the only real solution to any problem beyond the GoldMine Unknowledgeable Base (which I believe they purposely do not update) or their Customer ...Department is as basic as it gets. FrontRange (owner of Goldmine) constantly refers you to Goldmine Certified Consultants. It is obvious that FrontRange is leaving individuals and small business owners..."
2,Helpful?!,To a breif extent this book is helpful. I have never used Goldmine before and my company gave this book to me with hopes of better understanding on specific features Goldmine offers. GM within its self is a very basic program and is not hard to figure out. The book brought out a lot of little sugestions to help move about a lot smother. Unfortunatly I have found confusion on many sujects.For example one of my larger tasks thus far has been adding fields into the fields tab (Chapter 19). I think I would have a better understanding of this chapter if my company purchased GM Version 5. I'm sure the time I spent on this task could have been minimized if the author would have taken just a little more time for us users who are a little behind on the upgrade process.
5,Excellent Beginner Book (and more) On Goldmine,"After installing Goldmine 5 I bought this book when it first became available. I was not new to CRM software but found this book very useful. If you are new to Goldmine you will not be disappointed with this book. It can teach you a lot,even beyond the essential basics of this software. Read the book with your software running and apply what you just learned. After this foundation you should have little or no problem making the software do what you want. However, if you objective is to customize the software for your business, get a professional."
1,Size is definitely wrong,"I was really disappointed that these shoes didn't fit. The size marked as US 10.5 M are more than likely a men's size 8.5, maybe? I've worn the same shoe size for many years and these are not a size US 10.5. I couldn't even get my toe inside. This makes me wonder if any shoes ordered online will fit properly."
5,great shoes,"This was a very good buy. The price was right, they're comfortable and well made. I can't think of anything bad to say about them."
1,worthless,"the dumbest and worthless book I have ever purchased, I was relived to sell it to someone else on amazon."
2,Not worth it really,"This stool was not at all what I had expected. It is rather small considering it was designed to help toddlers step up to a toliet. Teh idea was clever, but it needs to be a bit larger and higher in height. I would not recommend this product."
1,ugh,I ordered the sesame street step stool & got this one I am so mad because my child loves Elmo & I was excited about getting the Sesame St one. It has a sesame st tag on it for $9.99 but it's not it. And I don't think I have time to return it and get the Elmo one by xmas ughhhh!!!
2,What happened Rosario???,"Despues de leer otros libros de Rosario Ferre, este libro de cuentos me decepciono profundamento. Los cuentos no tienen ni pies ni cabeza, demasiado modernos para mi gusto..."
4,America's Knitting Book by Gertrude Taylor,"This is an old book (1968)and a former library book, so it has markings and the usual wear and tear. However, it is a very informative knitting book that has everything for both beginners and advanced knitters. The illustrations are in black and white but they are pretty clear. The photos are also in black and white and not very attractive, but they serve their purpose. Overall, this book is a great value for the price ($4.73 including shipping). I'm glad I bought this book."
1,"This song ""you'll lose a good thing"" in the cd","The product description or the cover on the cd should have listed Barbara Lynn's only hit song on this cd is from a live recording performance, not from the original recording. The advertised posting should inform buyers of this information. I was disappointed when I received this purchase. So if you want her original recorded song don't buy this cd album."
1,Make sure you listen to the audio samples!,"After openning this CD and listening to it, I immediately regretted the purchase. I found nothing redeeming about these compositions. I might have appreciated the CD more if I were in the midst of a psychotic breakdown. Good luck."
2,Disappointed -- wedding dress is purple,"The wedding dress is actually purple. It looked white on my computer, so I was expecting a white wedding dress. However, when the barbie arrived we were very disappointed that the dress is a purple wedding dress. We would not have purchased the doll had we known the dress would have been purple. The doll is still pretty, it's just misleading to show it in white when it's actually in purple."
3,Nice barbie,I loved this Barbie...the hair may have felt like it was tough and would not be able to be combed....But just hold the hair alone over the sink and be careful not to get water into the hole surrounding the crown on the dolls head just wash the hair carefully with a bit of soap then carefully and immediatelt dry the excess water with ofcourse a dry towel and you are good to go.Loved the doll
5,So thrilled!,"This diamond chunk of music has been ssooo hard to find in the recent past. I paid alot more for my copy once I finally found one that I could afford,... but I have never gotten tired or stopped enjoying this double disc set!! Its the music, THE DRUMS!, but very importantly the arrangement. It feels so right,...so organic/orgasmic actually!"
1,Appallingly bad remaster of a classic album,"Marianne Faithfull's 1965 ""Come My Way"" is a wonderful album comprised mostly of folk songs, but whoever was responsible for remastering this reissue should never be allowed to work in audio engineering again. The audio was recorded excessively loud, and distortion abounds. Avoid any editions by the Cherry, Rev-Ola and Lilith labels at any cost and get the DECCA edition instead."

3,I enjoyed this book very much and it kept me reading,"It is about a young boy called Denzel who lives in the ancient times and has a master who is a wizard. The wizard leaves Denzel,and Denzel looks up the magic spells,and creates a spell that takes him into the future and he then mets a family who take care of him and help him get back home"
1,good product if it wasn't expired,"I got got this item in the mail and the manufacture guaranteed date was in October of 2011, I took it anyways and felt more sexual drive so it still worked. I just wish I wouldn't have paid for an expired product."
4,I think it works,"I don't know if it was a placebo effect or if it really works, but after a week of taking this, I was really horny to say the least. I went 4 days without having sex and when me and my girlfriend were finally alone, all I wanted to do was rip her clothes off. =P the sex was great but the only downside is that since I was so horny, I didn't last too long...I don't think I've ever been so hard before though =)"
3,Not Bad.,"It does work,Believe it or not i use it as a Testosterone booster,As a pre workout supplement and its always nice to have higher libido effect,Hard to tell if it's consistant ,as i had mentioned before on Amazon About certain herbal Supplements and roots I believe They work better when cycled like three days on two days off.Tribulus at that mg amount is a very low on this product,Not a bad product though.Swanson got the best prices!"
3,Not bad as a daily supplement,"I bought these for my husband, hoping he would take them every day. Nothing happened for him, but this was mainly because he didn't take them everyday. As with all herbal supplements, you have to take them everyday as directed for some time to see any results. It took my husband three months to finish a 30 day supply. I am sure that if he had taken them every day like he was supposed to he would have seen some results."
4,An excelent Read,"Books gives a good detail about the long and rich history of the Falls. It was interesting to learn how the formed, were discovered and later developed. The first few chapters were good, as were the chapters regarding the personal stories of those people who challenged and who changed the niagara. The story slows down in the middle a little with the description of the explotation of the falls in the late 1800's to early1900's, but still none the less an excelent look at the history of Niagara Falls."
1,Software does not run under Windows Vista,"This is/was a great piece of software that no longer seems to be supported. It definitely does not run ""out of the box"" under Windows Vista. How it can command a price of $20 is beyond me, unless it has somehow become a collector's item. I will try this on an ""XP"" machine one of these days and will update my review if it runs under that environment."
5,"Quality recordings, worth the small investment!","I have the audio tape and used it with my infant daughter when she wouldn't sleep well, the only problem was the abrupt tell-tale click at the end! I had wished for the cd version and now that it is available- I most definitely recommend it! You will hear very soft, soothing sounds from inside the mother's womb- a serious relaxant for any human being, regardless of age!"
3,Not so much.,"Didn't really work for us. The music was fine, and not overly irritating, but it didn't sooth our baby or put him to sleep.Classical music actually worked better, and was significantly cheaper. Plus, far more entertaining for us to listen to."
5,music for babies to sleep,"This CD was used in most of our childbirth and infant massage classes. It was relaxing but I had other CDs I liked better. While in the hospital, my new baby was lulled to sleep while sitting next to it. I called the hospital and asked what the CD was. Since ordering it, these CDs calm her when she's upset and she's been sleeping through the night. Every new mother should have these!"
5,The Perfect Gift for New Parents,"These original Transitions recordings make a unique and appreciated gift for parents to calm their crying infants effectively, within minutes."
5,Transitions,"Bought it for my daughter who is expecting. We found it very relaxing to listen to and hopefully so will the baby. Love the warning on the insert.....Do not listen to while driving....yes, it would put you to sleep.:) Good music for meditating or doing massage."
3,"OK, But clip is too loose.","Its a USB Flash drive. It holds Data. It works well. No driver intallation issues. What else is there?512MB is a small drive space these days, but we needed to find a drive that would still work on a Windows98 system, which this does.Because it is physically small it might be more easily lost - especially due to my one main complaint for this drive: the rotating clip that covers the USB jack slips off much too easily and often, which means even if clipped to a keychain that drive is going to fall off sooner or later."
4,Awesome emblem!,"I loved this car emblem, until it fell off my car. It looks great and you get what you see.. My only issue is that it fell off my car less than 5 months after being on there. :("
5,AAAAAAAARRRRrrrrgh!,"Furthermore, Pastafarians believe that pirates' image as ""thieves and outcasts"" is misinformation spread by Christian theologians in the Middle Ages and by Hare Krishnas."
2,WHAT HAPPENED?!!!,"In an effort to sabotage Catwoman's reputation, Vatical and Kemco conspired to create of one the worst video games imaginable so that no developer would ever touch her liscence again.Before I played this game, I was hoping for a playing style similar to Batman: The Video Game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Unfortunately, what I got was a clunky, barely playable insult to one of my favorite DC heroes/villains. Not only is Selena Kyle unable to attack while air-borne, she can't even move when she's not on the ground. Okay, so you can swing across ceilings, but that's the extent of it. The gameplay is monotonous and the animation is poorly done, not even exceptable by South Park standards. If there is one thing Catwoman can do that others can't in their own games, it's sidestep into the background.I hope this [game] doesn't discourage developers from making a newer, much better game starring the infamous cat burgaler."
2,"Well,","as another reviewer noted, you get what you pay for. You can certainly use this book; the info is sound. However, it's also somewhat basic, and most of it is available online. The range maps were cool, the photos were good, and even the info was OK. It's just all out on the web, for free. The book doesn't exactly go into great depth as to the natural habits and habitats of the animals (not really it's point), and is restricted to being a ""pet store"" type of book. It is what it is, and it's OK for it, but you can get better, more in depth info, for a little more, and pretty much the same info for free. It'll tell you how to keep your critter alive, and maybe breed it, but not much more."
3,"It's allright, but nothing special","I bought this book the day I got my Pueblan milk snake. It's interesting, but nothing special. You can get all of this information (plus some) off the internet for free. The only reason I gave as many stars as I did is because it had a lot of color pictures, there was one section in the back that proves useful. My snake was having some trouble shedding, and they had some helpful advice for when this happened. I live in a little hillbilly town in Oregon, and we don't have any exotic vets nearby, so without that info, my little Beetlejuice may have lost an eye, or worse.All in all, it's worth a read. You get what you pay for ^_^"
2,Future Trance regressing?,"What is Polystar thinking? Remixed songs from the 90's? This new album is cheese compared to their last releases. I believe even the record label knew that because I just bought it for half the price of all of their previous volumes. If you are a hardcore FT fan, buy this CD... If not, I recommend Vol 20-23 and their Special Edition(2002)..."
1,Just plain cheese,"There is nothing ""Future"" about this trance. Non-stop 90s semi-hits remixed. Aaaargh! Do NOT buy this!"
5,One of those books you can't put down,"The characters in this book are completely haunting. Days after finishing the book, I find myself thinking about all of them--the experiences they shared, the decisions they made, the truths they learned. This is one of those books you can't put down, because even when you do, you keep thinking about it. A 5-star winner."
5,When Masters meet,"It's important to be said that that phonogram brings the meeting of two genius, the best all times Jazz singer and the marvelous - and rigorous - Buddy Rich band, recorded mixing and mastering accomplished at the top of their maturity, in 1978 and presents a very modern, sophisticate and eclectic musical material. Arranged by Tormé, except Blues in the night, with a brilliant Marty Paich arrangement, it is certainly one of the most perfect recordings made at the phonographic industry history. Do not hesitate about purchasing it again. As a matter of fact, I had already bought the vinyl. Have a unforgettable time!"
2,"+1/2? A dull, muddled film noir.","A badly miscast Pat O'Brien leads an undistinguished cast in this muddled, ponderous noir snoozer about a brooding art historian who finds himself framed for... um... something. It seems that someone is stealing great paintings from a major museum and O'Brien is being set up to take the fall. He shows up disoriented and disshevelled, claiming to have been in a train wreck and yet... no train accidents have been reported in months. For some reason, the cops want to arrest him, and he inexplicably goes on the lam. This is one of those chase films where the character's actions and motivations don't really make much sense, and as a result it's hard to get involved in the plot. It's also not a very moody film, and for a film noir, that's definitely a serious shortcoming. Skippable."
5,"High quality, does the job","Not much to say about these letters other than they are high quality, easy to read and do the job. I installed on a felt letter board with no issues. Would definitely recommend."
2,Too many footnotes!,"The persona of the fictional author - a Cambridge academician - probably explains why there are footnotes on practically every page of this novel, but instead of making the story more interesting, they drag down the action. I wish I could say I liked this book since I was looking forward to it, but I found it slow-moving and even kind of boring. I gave up after around 30 pages. I figure if a book doesn't grab me by then, I'll just move on."
2,"they need to call this "" peter steel & death metal""","first off peter gets way too much time for this dvd ( its about death metal!!!! not your job picking up trash in new york ) and they cut the live songs, suffocation plays the first half of a new song and then it cuts. THAT JUST SUCKS!!! but they do have cool interviews with some cool guys in death metal ( brutal truth, suffocation , death & mortician ) and some funny promo clips from deranged & brutal truth )i just hope next time, they won't cut live songskeep buying death metal from amazon!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This DVD is not worth the Money,"I bought this DVD expecting to see lots of Death Metal Music and some behind the scenes banter. What I got was all talk from the some of the genre's least dynamic bands. The talking goes on endlesly and they have nothing to say. There is hardly any music on this disk and hardly any of it is worth listening to. I am a fan of all metal... Black, Death, Progressive, Power, Nu, Whatever.... And this disk is weak!"
3,Low budget and long-winded...,"I purchased this dvd not expecting too much because it was cheap. I guess I got what I payed for. It was definitely filmed on little or no budget, but that was not my biggest gripe. It was the repeated comments on the genre. It really lacked focus and structure. If you love death metal, you may find it interesting but only if you enjoy listening to artists talk about the genre and not actually listening to it. This dvd could have done more to help itself if it included some more noteworthy clips from artists, some album cover artwork and some sort of history of the genre."
5,Good anthology of postmodern theory,"Nicol has complied a good anthology of some of the salient essays in postmodern theory. A great place to get your theoretical feet wet, though not perhaps thorough enough for a deep study of postmodern literature."
5,Inspire Kids to Read!,"Cindy Lovell Oliver captivates her reader's imagination through the journey of Rachel Mason. Rachel Mason will not only gain the interest of hesitant young readers, but also inspire them to continue to love reading. I would encourage every educator to read Rachel Mason and perhaps use it as a companion reader in the classroom."
5,Best PSP Speaker Set,"I just got my hands on the PlayGear Amp. It is a great set of speakers for the value. It gently cradles the PSP and the sound output is adequate for music, video games, and video entertainment. Of course this isn't your $250+ Bose system, but for under $20 it is unrivaled."
4,Decent little speaker set,"While this attractive little speaker set isn't going to hit you up with bass, doesn't mean that you aren't going to be pleased with the full range of sound they are capable of producing, excellent speaker for Spoken word/audiobooks, and even better for movies with lush full soundscapes. Not really for rocking out but a perfect replacement for missing or gigantic PC speakers, comes with 2 patch cords and works with almost any MP3 player, game system etc. Nice case and AAA battery optional operation as well. Pleased"
5,Good Buy,Works great for what I need it for. Speakers are powerful and the price was not bad. Mount really only works for the psp 1000 though. the 2/3000 sit well enough but the plugs do not
4,Probably the best external sound solution for the PSP,"Awesome. It looks good, doesn't feel flimsy and has great sound for the price and size of the unit. It's also extremely portable and the case is decent. Though I will say that the review that describes this as producing sound on par to that of a top-notch portable stereo is a bit overstated. I'd say it's more like decent computer speakers. Then again, I'm kind of a sound snob. I'd have given it 5 stars if the sound could rattle my living room windows. One minor bad point, the cradle didn't fit my PSP Slim God of War Edition. Hardly a deal-breaker though. All in all an excellent product."
4,Great speakers.,"I was looking at speakers for my PSP for months before I finally settled on this one. So the most important thing here is the sound quality and it does sound great- room filling sound with no tinny highs and of course no bass. Just clear, loud sound. What I really love is that you can hook up any MP3 player to the audio jack (or even a laptop or PC). I also like that it can run on AC (included) or batteries.Now I like the case that it comes with but unfortunately there's no room for the PSP to go in it. So it's cumbersome to travel with. But hey you can always get really compact speakers that sound like..."
4,PSP 2000 mod,"This is a good little speaker system for the money ( I got it for $20), but in order to use it with the newer slim PSP 2000 you have to modify it in order to hook up the speaker jack. On the left side of the stand you need to cut out a notch to fit the jack in it's proper place. I used an exacto knife and a very small pair of diagonal cutters. Also there are two small unnecessary tabs on the inside bottom of the stand which I cut off. Works great!"
4,Great product,"This is a good product. It is very cheap and has very loud speakers. If you are trying to spend a little bit of money, then this is the speakers system for you."
2,good and not so good,These is a nice little speaker system the downfall is the place where the PSP sets is a little hard to get the PSP to set the PSP in and still operate it it tips over so we just hook up the speakers and and don't really use the stand part they are nice little speakers
1,Disappointed,I have to agree with one of the previous reviews. These speakers were great for about a week. I now have the buzzing sound and poor speaker quality.
3,A mediocre film for great musicians,"It is interesting because everything in Kronos is interesting, but the DVD itself is uninspired; there is no concept, no editing, no project, no idea. But it is what we got, and I enjoyed seeing my favorite group."
5,Really Good Instructional Video,"This video is extremely good at teaching all aspects of boxing including ""illegal"" shots like elbows, head butts, and a few others. Mark Hatmker is so good at breaking things down to their scientific components, which was sorely lacking from previous instruction that I received. The best thing in the video is the rock solid defense it has given me. If you are looking to improve your striking you can't go wrong. The info is presented in a straight forward manner, and a good training methodology is shown."
5,The unpredictable Mr. Lourie...,"This CD would be invaluable even if it consisted merely of the first two tracks: the 1st string quartet of Lourie is an amazing achievement of a 23year old-youth (the piece was written in 1915, and not in 1921 as it's mentioned in the liner notes), which together with ""Formes en l' air"" and ""Syntheses"" stands out as one of the weirdest experiments of the remarkable Russian..."
1,not every good!,we have tried these cd's and did not like them not able to record on them at all. it was a waste of money
5,Messianic Must Read,"If you're confused about the place of orthodoxy in the Messianic Movement, this book is for you."
3,A disappointment,"After reading The Unbearable Lightness of Being, I was determined to read as many Kundera works as possible. The short stories in Laughable Loves are nowhere near the genius or perfection of The Unbearable Lightness of Being."
3,Not Impressed As Much...,The Style of writing is not as inspiring as other Kundera's books. Some of the short light reading stories are really slow to follow and to see what Kundera was trying to transmit by his endings...
5,Deceptively Light,"This is a collection of seven very early stories by Milan Kundera. I believe they were mostly written during the 60's and are set in the Czechoslovakia of that time.He has an innovative but very readable style - simple, precise, light. These stories bring out philosophical mysteries while being page turning reads at the same time. They sort of remind me of fables, but without any obvious moral lessons. Not exactly anyway. They will, however, give you plenty to think about on the nature of Identity, Desire, Ego, etc.For me, this is Kundera at his best or very near. I really liked Unbearable Lightness of Being and The Book of Laughter and Forgetting and this book has the same virtues as those. I think some of his later works, like Immortalitiy, tended towards self indulgence, but the early and middle stuff is some of the most inventive, engaging work of the 20th century."
4,Cute Counting Book,"As one of the less monotonous to read counting books to be found, the story is basic and educational but cute (especially if your child has a guinea pig). I feel like fresh artwork would completely makeover this book and make it a better read."
5,helpful & well done advice for living better !,"I found Forty Something very easy to read & i garnered so much information from it,i would highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to live a longer & healthier life !witty & poignant - a must read !"
4,Great overview of the Old Testament,"I have found this book to be very informative and accurate. It totally agrees with a historical Adam and Yahweh creation accounts from Scripture. I am reading it in parallel with Jim Hamilton's ""God's Glory in Salvation through Judgment"". It makes a great companion."
5,Love Joe Grey,The books in this series never fail to entertain me! I love the cats and their human friends. (I'm just waiting for my two cats to start talking!) After a hectic day these books totally relax me.
3,Not one of her best,"____________________________________________This ""Joe Grey"" fantasy cat-detective novel is readable, but weak and implausible. As in many long-running series, my willing suspension of disbelief suffers from the sheer quantity of mayhem that happens to Our Heroes and their pals. Murphy needs a fresh start with a new series, I'd guess. Note that the first 4 or 5 Joe Greys are delightful. Just don't start here!Happy reading--Peter D. Tillman"
4,"I hate poetry, so naturally Bukowski's poetry works for me","I love Bukowski's fiction, its straightforward, unadorned, yet precise diction, and its degraded, yet implacable hero(es?).Poetry, to me, has always seemed a florid waste of time, and a lazy man's game. It seems like shorthand at its best moments.But I can't get over the fact that this guy, while making fun of the form, is able to nail his little portraits with alarming consistency.Some of these, like ""My Ivy League Friends,"" are narrative, mean and straight.Others, still eschewing metaphor, are humming, man-shaped bells, like ""No Help For That.""There are some duds, and I won't bother pointing to them because they'll be obvious when you come to them.But, I like this guy a lot. He's real, even when he does his best to avoid it."
3,It was nice.,"It was nice. It was a bit like reading my own scibblings, though. It's not Bukowski's absolute best, but it was nice collection of ramblings. I didn't find much in it that really stood out.Any Bukowski fan would like it. If you're not a Bukowski buff already, don't bother, unless you'd want to hear random ramblings from the journal of a drunk old cynic."
5,bukowski,Another great piece from bukowski he speaks to me in a way no one else ever has. In direct non nonsense language. Fan for life.
4,Trashcan Lives,"Let's get this clear from the start: Charles Bukowski is the greatest American poet, who just happens to be unknown to the Americans I talk to. Just the other day in the library, I asked for his famous ""Post Office"" and they told me ""Charles who?""""You've never heard of Charles Bukowski?""""No."" The Librarian gave me a puzzled look.""He's the greatest American poet?""""Really?""And so on...What can I tell you about this book? Like in any other Buck's book there's so much trash in here that it's hard to make out what's good. There are several poems that are true masterpieces like ""Trashcan Lives"" or ""Darkness,"" and some others. Would I recommend it? YES! If you're just starting to read Bukowski, don't bother with this, get an anthology. If you know Buck's works already, get this, you'll love it!"
5,A Must Read,"Ranks alongside ""Dangling"" and ""Wild Horses"" as Bukowski's most satisfying poetry collections. A truly great book."
4,another review,Not as good as Love is a dog... but still worth reading. there are some really good poems in there.
4,Good Listening,If you like to listen to familair and relaxing music then this is for you. I find myself singing aloing with the music.
5,great indoor grilling reference,"easy to read, I find myself grabbing it first off the shelf for a quick dinner. Recipes are written for several indoor grills. Good recipes for sides and veggies as well."
5,Enjoyed it very much,"Got many ideas out of it. I like how he gives several grilling options whenever possible, and everything I've made so far has been quite tasty."
2,not what i thought it was,"It's a ok book just not what I really expected. There some good recipes in here but the mixtures are not really my favorite but I will say some or very few are. Plus the kind of grill I have there not that many recipes for it, I recommend this book if you have multiple indoor grills best of luck."
3,Not what I expected,I ordered this book for practical recipes for my indoor grill. The recipes are not what I expected. They are not for every day grilling - strange combinations of ingredients. I plan to sell this at my next yard sale.
1,"Poorly written, disorganized.",Too many recipes are as basic as 'salt pepper and garlic'. Poor indexing. I was seeking more infomation on the merits of different techniques and did not find it. Very short on recipes for stovetop smokers.
5,Indoor! Grilling as good as outdoor and EASIER!,"We don't have an outdoor grill. I love my George Foreman grill but didn't have a good variety of recipes and still always envied my friends who cooked incredible recipes on their gas grills outdoors. No more! I am loving the variety and end result of many of the recipes I've tried in this new, comprehensive cookbook!"
1,Disappointed,"If you are looking for product information (older since this book was published a while ago), OK this will do but you've got to pull the info you need out of this book."
5,Stinkin' Thinkin' (This would have been a funnier title),This is a great book. I haven't enjoyed a book as much since Bloom's 'The Closing of the American Mind'.
1,A tedious polemic and waste of time,"Only 10 years old and it already seems outdated, this sort of peevish crankiness from spoiled academics complaining about the idiot conversations going on in their subsidized ivory towers is an affront to every inhabitant of the real world. It is astonishing the waste of intellectual energy the baby boom generation has indulged in.The only portion of the book I found slightly worth the trouble was the section on the Goddess-hype in anthropology, which allowed me to indulge my mild curiousity in the subject without having to wade into volumes of feminist cant; but if you wanted to actually be the least informed about any subject, this isn't the place to look."
2,Preaches to the choir,"I really wanted to like this book. But as other reviewers have said, the author's own peculiar prejudices somehow escape the thresher of his otherwise well-trained mind. They really ought to have had the treatment he gives others, especially in a book about ""plagues of the mind."" It would have made for a far stronger and more interesting argument."
4,Fighting False Knowledge with False Knowledge,"Though I have not finished reading the book, when I got into Chapter 5 I had such a strong reaction to the argument I felt I could not wait to comment.In answer to the author's invitation in the first paragraph of his Preface, that his ""own ideas be subject to the same scrutiny"", I submit what I see as one of the most glaring difficulties with this book: Bruce Thornton's use of Darwinian Evolutionary Theory to argue against Romantic Environmentalism. He appears to have swallowed--hook, line and sinker--this massive body of debatable (perhaps false) knowledge, the science of which he does not seem to question. As an antidote to this strain of the virus, I would strongly recommend a dose of Phillip E. Johnson, e.g., [...]In spite of this flaw, I still found most of Part I to be helpful reading; especially as one who is a 'member of the choir'."
4,Compelling and Profound,"I found this book to be honest and insightful.Easy to read,and hard to put down.Mr.Thornton writes with clarity and authority.It,s a pleasure to own this book."
5,A superlative field guide with gardening information too,"Would a field guide like this make a good holiday gift for a naturalist or gardener? Absolutely-if I didn't own it already it would be my number one choice. This is the best researched field guide I've ever seen. It is very very satisfying and is going to become a must-have for anyone who hikes the northeast or would like to garden with ferns, and for all botany students of the region. A book like this is more than just a guide-it trains the eye to open up to an entire world of subtle differences in nature. There is a kind of poetry in this guide usually not seen in this type of writing-BRILLIANT! Get one soon to catch the ferns in fall color-or do a little armchair gardening over the winter."
5,Botanical Field Guide,"With the caveat that I have just begun to use this and have limited exposure to it, I find so far that it's compact, comprehensive, and authoritative. I particularly like the field markers highlighted under each species, which is a real time saver when you're on the move. If you want something for field trips, I think you'll be happy with this."
2,tough reading,"This paperback was not very costly so I don't feel that it's a complete loss. I suppose if I get stuck in the house or go to prison, I will have the time to read it from cover to cover, but for now it is just too much to take in. There are many different ferns growing around the wetlands and fields where I live in Connecticut.I was hoping that this would be a simple guide to identifying them. I guess I need a fern for idiots book instead. I would highly recommend it for a Botany grad student."
4,This book is entertaining and enlightening,"This book takes qoutations from many different sufi ""dervishes"", some are ancient and some contemporary. Nonetheless the wisdom in this book is largely timeless. From Sheik Muzaffer and Rumi and as far back as Muhammad himself. this book does not limit its spiritual wisdoms to only muslims (I am not muslim) but to any person who seeks the spiritual side of themselves. These wisdoms are arranged in short quotes and small fable-like stories making it extremely easy to read. In short, it is a very interesting and enlightening book."
5,Beautiful Book,"This is the first book which i read on Sufism and it taught me alot not just about this topic but as well as about life in general. The book teaches you how u can live a quality life. It defines sufism very well and then goes on with each chapter focusing on a different topic like love, prayer etc. Anyone interested in reading something quality rules of life must read this book."
3,An Overview of Sufism,I lot of great quotes but no personal reflection from the Author.I am not convinced that the Publisher got the magnitude of what he was printing.Good book but I got board. Maybe it was just me I may not be ready for a book that leaves the direction of the reader up to his understanding.
1,Don't expect it to work as it says it should,"I bought this laminator because it says it did 7mil laminations, which is what I was looking for. It does not handle 7 mil at all. I had to put the 7 mil through the laminator over 30 times to get it to remotely work and then it was bubbled and ruined my item I was laminating, which was on thin paper. I returned it and tried another one. I got the same restults. I tried using 5 mil and still had to put it through a couple times before working. I would not pay the money to get this unless you were only using 3 mil and didn't mind the chances of haivng to put it through a couple times. I ended up returning it all together and now am stuck with a whole package of 7 mil laminating sheets that I can't use, since I had to use a couple to test the laminator."
1,Not designed to hold it's own weight,"This is the worst floor lamp I've ever owned. The aluminum threads that connect the lamp bar to the base are cheaply made, and as a result it is impossible to tighten completely. After you screw it in completely, just a little more pressure and the threads will pop out causing the lamp to wobble around in the base. Every time you adjust the reading lamp the threads on the base will pop out.Also, the reading lamp is too heavy for the base, so don't even consider using this lamp on carpet. It will constantly lean towards the reading lamp a few inches off center.This isn't just a fluke, I bought two of these lamps at the same time, and they both have this problem.The lamps look really cool, but beyond that they are complete junk."
1,broke off at base,"As another reviewer mentions this is a very unstable lamp. I have only ever moved it to vacuum underneath it and it was always wobbly due to a problem with the threading at the connecting points. This morning, less than a year after purchase, I heard a snapping sound and saw the entire thing come down. There was no-one near it. Just broke off. It's a beautiful lamp but that does me no good if I can't trust it to stay upright."
4,A good game with minor set backs,"Grnad theft auto o the Game boy color does not quite have the same appeal or ""playerability"" of the PC version, but for such a small screen it has excellent graphics (crystal clear) and has over 100 tasks. It does require, if you want to save your games, a battery backed file and has an excellent sound track. Excellent if you don't cart your PC around with you when you go on holiday. Altogether an excellent game for an excellent price."
5,"GTA--good gameplay, annoying controls","GTA is the first game I got for my Game Boy Color. The controls are hard to get used to, but after you understand them, the game is really fun. It's not good for little kids, the controls might be too hard and the language too raw, but for a teenager, it's one of the best games on the market."
1,Terrible,"Sleazy manual, terrible controls, this game just isn't fun. Hard to go around corners, it's almost impossible to get a car. And shooting weapons is just plain annoying. For your sake, don't buy this game!!!"
3,Unique game with BAD controls,"If you can get past the awful controls on this game, it is actually fairly fun to play. You get to be the bad guy this time around, which has an addictive attraction if you ask me.Run over cops, shoot cops, mow down pedestrians for no apparent reason, etc. Fun, right? Yep, you bet. Good luck with those controls though, you're gonna need it."
2,Die Hard Fans Only,"As a player of GTA for playstation, I bought this game expecting a portable version of the same fun. What I got was this sick excuse for a game. First, this game is rated Teen and not Mature, and you can definitely tell. The language is cleaned up(very obviously in some parts), which is good or bad, depending on your point of view. The jobs in the GBC game are the same for playstation, but most people familiar with other games will be dissappointed by this. There are barely any pedestrians and cars to steal. Only consider getting this if you're a hard-core fan of these games."
3,"IS IT WORST,BETTER OR THE SAME AS DRIVER ON GBC.","Well is it?-i enjoyed the GBC Driver but i hear In this GTA you can quit the car,steal another kill peple sounds Desent for a GameBoy game......"
1,"#$%@, DOES THIS GAME SUCK!","Yes, yes, GTA is a great series of games; just not the GameBoy versions.First, the city you're in must be some post-apocalyptic place where everone has died, because THERE ARE NO CARS ANYWHERE! THERE ARE NO PEOPLE ANYWHERE! How can you carjack and kill without cars or people?Second, the play control is TERRIBLE. I... I can't go on... it's just too horrible.Buy the PC or PS versions, but not this. You will cry."
3,like missions?,"one very important thing to remember is that they couldn't put many cars in this game. you're lucky if you see more than 4 cars at once on the same screen. it's also very hard to get a car, even if it's parked, because it's so hard to get in one. also, it's rare to see even a single person walking the streets, unless it's part of a mission. I normally just play to maul hundreds of people walking the streets, but I had alot of fun just trying the missions."
1,Stupid,Game is super hard and stupid.i thought it was gonna be easy but super hard do not buy this game
1,Save your money!,"Don't get Grand Theft Auto on GameBoy! Get it on PlayStation if you still have the original console! Tour around the New York City based Libery City made up of Brocklyn, Kings, Brix, and Manchester surrounded by the neighboring state of New Guernsey! Then tour around the San Andreas Faultline based San Andreas. Then tour around Miami based Vice City!"
3,OK,My cousin let me play it 'cause I let link cable. I couldn't understand it at first. All he said was to follow the arrow. Then I finally found the phone booths. I couldn't really drive the car at first. So if you want this game rent it first.
3,This game is all right.,"This game is nothing like the on Playstation, and wouldnt buy it again if i had to. -One flaw is it is to hard to get into cars. And if you get stuk, you have to turn off the system and start over. Another thing is the AI is horrable. The people on the sidewalk just stand there and WAIT for you to hit them or shoot them. The police are SO stupid. You can stand on one side of a car and the police will just keep running into the car not doing anything. What IS fun is running people down with your Doge Viper."
1,No value added to the subject,"One of the most significant debates in the financial industry nowadays is the one of quantification of operational risk. This book does not add anything to the discussion. Find qualitative standards for operational risk inside a bank is a challenging but always achievable task as it usually relies on the particular characteristics of the own organization. The problem lies on the quantification. Subjects like operational risk capital allocation, VaR models, correlation etc are not mentioned here. The book is absolutely qualitative with many flaws even there."
5,Must have book!,"I'd like to thank Jack Knowlton and Harriett Barton for writing and illustrating ""Geography from A to Z.""My daughter and I had a great time reading it together and she became the only first grader to know the basics of geography. A life long lesson.I recommend this book for all children and would definitely give it as a gift.""Geography from A to Z"" has become part of my permanent library."
5,Great picture glossary,"Very thorough, great pictures, simple explanations - great resource for elementary school. One of the best physical geography books I've seen for this age."
3,Geography Dictionary,"I didn't realize that this would be a straight-forward dictionary of some geography terms, but that's what it is. My child never read it after flipping through once. It's very boring"
3,"Good book, but it needs a supplement","From the perspective a first year med student:1. Great writing. Not as dry a writing style as other books Ihave looked over.2. Chincy on diagrams and charts. If you are expecting atextbook with glossy pages filled with colour diagrams (thisbook has neither), then either choose an other book or buy agood supplement (like Rohen's Color Atlas of Anatomy).3. I wouldn't say this is the best book for an intro to anatomy.For example, in the section on ""Terms of position, planes,direction, and movement"", there are no illustrations. If youare a visual learner (as I am), then you may find thisfrustrating."
3,Could have been better!,"I just finish reading Promise of a Rose and found it somewhat lacking, after reading some of the reviews, I thought wow I would be buying a great book. But I was disappointed, first of all Mary has lots of guts and endurance which I found wounderful in a female character, but it was the same thing over and over again all the way through. But what was great about this book was the mention of Geoffery, who seem to be a lusty, romantic, sexy and loving character who I would love [the author] to write about."
4,GREAT & FAST READ!,"The only thing I disliked about this book was that I couldn't put it down. I found myself reading it during every available second of every day even burning supper so I could finish a page! Lately, most stories can't hold my interest longer than the first few pages because their plots are too predictable or there is no chemistry between the characters or it is too unbelievable. Ms. Joyce has no problems creating chemistry and her characters feel real. I won't get into the storyline or what I liked about each character; read the book, you'll see what I'm talking about!"
2,Disappointed,"I recently became a fan of de Warenne series, so I thought that this will give me a nice view of how it all started. I was also sold on so many stars here, but boy was I disappointed.After the disturbing 50 pages, the first part of the book was pretty ok, but it just went downhill from there. I also hated the 'hero'. Knowing the regular de Warenne men characters, Stephen was very unlikable and not what I expected.Another thing- I know that it was written back in the early 90s, but please, since when are incest, domestic abuse, child molestation, and rape considered to be romantic?!Also, I did not really care about the historical background (although some readers might really be all over this), so I was skipping those long, long parts."
5,HOT! HOTTER! HOTTEST!,"Stephan and Mary are from two very powerful families. When they meet for the ""first time"" it's lust at first sight with a capital ""L"". Their love scenes have your palms sweating like you are there! Mary hides her true identity when Stephan captures her. When Stephan finds out who Mary really is... their marry. Although she balks and fights him at every turn she can't deny the expolisve love she has had for him for a very long time. The love story between Stephen and Mary is amazing and combustible! Through betrayal, deceit, lies, adultery and more, they manage to survive it all! This book is a keeper. I have read it numerous times and never become bored."
1,poor imitation of judith mcnaught's kingdom of dreams,i tried and i was halfway done but i just had to stop. the conflicts are not believable. listen to this : your husband is secretly planning to attack your family and your people and you were suspicious so you eavesdropped. he found out and yet the issue was you spying on him instead of him killing your family? ! ridiculous. her pathetic attempt to win him back was a little too much for me. try Jude deveraux or judith mcnaught. they're more reliable. kingdom of dreams is a great romance novel with a believable heroine.
5,awsome book,great book...bought the kindle version yesterday and had to finish it...does anyone know if brenda ever written about rolfe other kids...would love to read about his daughter ...
2,Mirror Image...,"""Promise Of The Rose"" was a pretty good read, but a bit long winded. It also mirrored a few of her other novels (of course they all ""mirror"" each other) but it seems like I've read something of hers that was along this same line (but with different characters). All in all if you read the first couple of chapters and start skipping pages here and there you don't miss any of the story and you get to the point a whole lot faster ;)"
5,"WOW, This Book Has Everything , I could not Put it Down!","I could not put this book down. Brenda Joyce is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. I loved this book and was very happy to find out it was the sequel to another great book by Brenda Joyce I just finished 'The Conqueror'. This book is about The Conqueror's oldest son Stephen. You also get to revisit characters from the past. The Love between Stephen and Scotlands princess Mary was exciting, heart warming and sad. Brenda Joyce has a way of writing that vividly takes you where the characters are. You want to laugh, cry and shake them to open up their eyes to the truth. You better believe I will be reading more of this authors books. I am hoping there are other books about Stephens two younger brothers and sister. I did not want it to end."
2,DISSAPOINTING,I cannot believe this book is by the same author as 'The Conqueror'. I am a huge fan of Brenda Joyce but this book really left a bitter taste in my mouth.Stephen treated Mary like dirt until the last chapter and she lapped it up. It was disgusting.Skip this one.
3,1/2 stars.....A fast read,"I have to confess that this book did not live up to my expectations. I have also read the prequel to this book, The Conqueror, and it is one of my all time favourites. The Promise of the Rose did not have the same level of scorching sensuality, nor was it as engrossing as The Conqueror, simply because there were too meany characters in this book and I felt that the author did not concentrate much on the hero and heroine.The book is still worth reading once, as it is a pretty fast and interesting read.I also liked the character of Geoffrey DeWarrenne, and hope BJ writes a hot book on him some day......"
3,Good book for well-versed developers in/using multiple programming languages,"From the back cover of the Regular Expression Pocket Reference: ""Ideal as a quick reference..."" and ""... makes an ideal on-the-job companion."" All this is true if you are well-versed in regular expressions and use multiple programming languages (and confuse the syntax).I like the use of the same examples across programming languages (where applicable).The recipes in the cookbook section are great, although I would have liked to see additional recipes (like stripping HTML tags, matching credit card numbers etc...). Of course the examples are endless and over time one builds his/her own recipe collection. At least this is a good place to start."
4,Regarding the DavidPerry Review,"Nice cut and paste of the Ann Coulter book review. I particularly liked the ""Menckenesque invective"" comment which made me think that I had remembered reading it somewhere before. Anyway, I just wanted the readers of these reviews to know not to trust that one. Some people actually use these reviews to make a choice and avoid wasting money."
4,Regular Expresions OReilly - book review,"One of the better OReilly books. Very well written, great examples and explanations. I highly recommend."
2,Too many implementations covered,"I love this series of books (the C#, C++ and STL pocket refs are my favorite), but the Regular Expression pocket ref tries to cover too many implementations. You only get about 10 pages for each language so, unless you use multiple implementations (e.g. C#/.NET, Perl, JavaScript, etc), this just isn't good value for money. I returned my copy and printed out a quick reference from one of the many Internet programming sites."
1,Crazy Nonsense,"The needy author became a foster parent because she wanted to be loved, hence the title. This is not healthy. The author herself had serious problems, as her own bio says: ""She worked with disabled children for years until, looking for a change, she ran away with the carnival."" The book simply tells the sick story of how a needy person whom no one loved found a child whom no one loved. The entire story is pathetic. There is nothing to be gained from wasting one's time reading this book."
4,calcium pyruvate,"found this price to be reasonable, liked the fact that unlike other sites don't have to worry about monthly shipments"
3,Great resource but the Kindle version TOC doesn't match the text!,This is a gold standard resource text for neonatologists and pediatric neurologists. However my complaint is that the Kindle version has a hyperlinked table of contents that corresponds poorly with the actual material. I find it very difficult to find the beginning of chapters relative to where the hyperlink sends me (it's often more than a few pages off).Can someone fix this? (Should be pretty easy...)
5,Classic,"To all of you who enjoy Sergio's music I'm sure you will love this one. I had this on 8 track in my 1978 Ford Thunderbird (old school for real). I loved the music then and I love it even more today. I searched for 32 years to find this album again, that's how much I love it. I recently saw him in concert in Las Vegas and he sounds as good today as he ever did. Enjoy"
1,The wrong book was sent,"I was expecting Two Queens at the Abbey, one of the Elsie Jeanette Oxenham books about the Abbey school, and I received instead Selma at the Abbey, a book I already have. The seller has said the book I ordered may not be in stock, but I must return the wrong book to ensure getting the right one, assuming it's available."
4,I Agree...,"that this book is a keeper. This book is the sequel to ""Who's The Boss"" which I read just before reading this book. I think that by reading ""Who's The Boss"" first, it gave me a better understanding of the people involved in ""The Brennan Baby"".I thought that the heroine, Gillian, was very believable as a young woman who had been emotionally damaged by an extremely deprived childhood. Unlike her real life counterpart she found love and healing in the form of Devon who is a playboy with his feet on the ground. He is an orthopedic surgeon in residency at the same hospital that Gillian is employed.This is a quick and satisfying read that I recommend if you're not looking for something deep and time consuming."
4,"Fragmented and a bit self-important, but still useful","This book aims to be a ""one stop shop"" covering all aspects of web application security, however your app is written: Java. CGI, Perl, PHP, Active X. To a large extent it succeeds, and in a surprisingly readable way. Each chapter covers on aspect of hacking or security, and ends with a summary, a ""fast track"" checklist, and a FAQ for the topics covered. The book is sold like software - you can register for a ""1-year upgrade"", to keep the content fresh.Important topics include both detailed and general hints on how to read and spot security holes in code in different languages; and how to ""think like a hacker"", and use hacker tools to test your own security. Above all, the book emphasizes the need for creative thinking and to avoid producing code carelessly.I know from experience that security is often ignored if it's seen as too hard to understand, plan or test. Don't be a victim of your own ignorance, read this book."
2,Not for wood floors,I bought this because my bedroom door does not latch and I wanted to use it to keep the door from being pushed open by my cats while I'm trying to sleep. This does not grip my hard wood floors. My cat can still push the door open.
2,"Rubber is not soft/sticky enough, slides on tile","I live in a new condo building in a city. I have a heavy/heavy-duty and self-closing metal door that opens into the kitchen, which has large tile flooring. This doorstop is not working too well... easily slides on the tile. It doesn't help that the door self-closes either, pushing against it the entire time. I am disappointed in this purchase. I wish the rubber were grippier, but it's rather hard (well, harder than I thought it'd be at least) and so slides easily."
3,Not great for short pile carpet,"American-made and appears to be well-made as far as a hunk of rubber goes. The instructions are inadvertently hilarious; IMHO if you can't figure out how to work a doorstop without detailed written and graphic instructions, you shouldn't be trusted behind closed doors. It works OK but not great on my office door, which has limited clearance above very short pile carpeting."
5,Nice - as described!,Nice - item was as described and shipped in a timely fashion! Definitely would purchase again or recommend to friend.
1,Kenwood Loser,"I bought this player when it was [on sale]. It only played about 1/10 discs. Kenwood would not replace it b/c it was not purchased from an Kenwood authorized dealer. Luckily, Amazon also warranties the product for 1yr and I was able to replace it, after 2mo of going back and forth w/ Amazon. B/c of Kenwood's customer circus, I am going w/ another brand next time.NO STARS for this LEMON!!!"
4,Conquest war....,"Una guerra de conquista, una guerra injusta, una guerra provocada, impuesta a un debil vecino, nada que ver los los tan cacareados ideales norteamericanos de equidad y decencia..."
1,Book's cover is ruined by NON REMOVABLE sticker !,"This book was delivered in timely manner and was indeed the one I had ordered. BUT I am very disappointed to find the gently used book has a large non removable sticker that says USED BOOK. The sticker partially covers the lovely front cover picture of an icon which is so disappointing, and annoying. I am VERY displeased that this arrived like this. If you have to have a sticker at least use one that is removable! I would like to have my book replaced with one that does not have this sticker. Thank you."
2,Buy a 286 & The Original Game!,"There are some things that, no matter how lovingly and desparately people want to improve them - it just doesn't work. RailRoad Tycoon is one of them. This game for Playstation or the PC is very pretty and it works to some extent, but after a few weeks of trying, I went back to the original, ugly old EGA game, that works so well. You can pick up an old 286 and an original copy of RRT at the auction for less than the price of RRT II and you will have a lot more fun! A tip if you try and run the original RRT on newer hardware, you might have to pick MCGA or EGA on the opening screen - don't worry, it's the same graphics but some new hardware doesn't like the old VGA driver. Take it from someone who has been playing RRT since the days of the XT, the appeal of the game is in the AI, not in pretty graphics. The new version is just too slow in unfolding, too far off the economic mark and somehow loses the magic in the translation to 3-D."
1,Railroad tycoon 2,First off I wish I would have never shelled out my money for this game! It is the wost playstation game I have ever played. The text in the game is so hard to read and the game play is just plain frustrating. This game deserves -1 star because it was so bad. Please take my advice before purchasing this product. It will save you time and MONEY!
3,RR Tycoon 2,"Not a bad game, really hard to use with its old interface, not bad for cheap though.I looked up the instructions online and that made it easier."
5,"bears, bears, bears!","My family has been enjoying our bucket of counting bears for years. The rainbow colors are very appealing to youngsters. Bears can be sorted according to size (there are three sizes, aka Papa Bear, Mama bear, and Baby bear!) and/or color. We have a bucket balance scale that works beautifully with the bears, so that kids can discover how the different sizes correspond to one another. The bears are made of durable, very hard plastic. We have used these with three kids (plus friends) and have never broken one."
5,monsanto - you evil bastards,"One man takes on a dying planet. Simple, heart felt and inspired. Peter Proctor is a gentle man that quietly goes about the business of changing the way we farm. The dead soil of India, stripped of it's nutrients by harsh fertilizers and pesticides is turned back into rich earth though the practice of Biodynamic farming. Dying land and desperate farmers are saved by this unlikely hero. The film is beautifully written and photographed and well worth a look."
4,Important Info to solve the problems of todays world,this movie doc was very informative to understand the problems of commercial farming and provides good info and practical knowledge in setting up organic farming communites
5,An uplifting film about farming and food! Finally.,"This is an uplifting film about one man's effect on Indian farmers who are stuck in a cycle of debt to chemical companies - since their soil has died from chemical fertilizers. Besides natural techniques introduced to revive the soil and save the farmers - the film shows the power of one individual. Most of the recent ""Food movies"" are depressing; informative and necessary - yes, but depressing. This film on the other hand is inspiring and uplifting! An incredible positive story about a quiet man who goes into action - saves many farmers from ruin, and creates an entire Indian movement. Peter Coyote does a great job narrating."
2,unfortunate removal,"""One Man, One cow, One Planet"", apparently is not the same movie as"" How To Save The World : One Man, One Cow, One Planet"", as it is missing the original opening segment that showed the cutting up of an apple to represent various parts of the planet. This was a powerful statement that seemed to set the ""tone"" for the movie. I was quite disappointed to discover this. There was no information describing the difference between these two films."
2,Misleading,"This is a film I was very excited to come across. Unfortunately, the title is misleading. The film has very little to do with a cow. The cow should have been the center of the film, as the cow is the center of the farm. The film completely whiffs in this regard. So much potential, yet such a failure."
2,Easel,"The product arrived nicely packed, however the brackets that hold the picture were not sturdy and would move down the leg of easel. One of the brackets broke when trying to keep them from moving. Would not recommend this product."
2,Break very easily,These are cheap. The plastic supports snap with the slightest bit of pressure... ended up having to tape my displays to them. Not a quality product
1,Unstable,Very unstable. Unable to hold a small chalk board. I would not recommend to others to purchase. Very poor quality.
2,Unstable,"True to the description, this product does set up very easily. However, to call the resulting tripod an easel is misrepresentation. It lacks any of the stabilizing features of standard easels. There is no cross-bar, that joins the forward two legs of easels and supports the canvas or display card, nor is there any chain or other separation limiter connecting the third leg to the front legs. The unit as delivered collapsed when burdened with an art piece weighing less than three pounds."
5,"light, compact, internal bungee cords","easily taken up and down thanks to internal bungee cords--like a tent pole. i would not put anything too heavy on it, though. i just use it for foam poster boards."
3,Its well worth,"I thought I will receive something with handling bag to take the easel with me conveniently, but It's not included. But I like it! That's it! :)"
3,very collapsible easels,"The operative word here is collapsible. These easels open quickly and can be stored in a small place. However, they are good for only one piece of cardboard. Don't try anything like a 3 fold science presentation board, because it won't work; the easel is just not sturdy enough. Sometimes it's not easy to get the legs aligned and the clips which hold the boards in place are unpredictable at best. The clips slip and slide, and are not easily engaged. I wouldn't buy these again but I will use them while they last."
5,Quick and Easy,Love these easels! Setting them up takes about two seconds and they pack up neatly and compactly.
3,Quartet Full Size Easel,"I bought one of these easels for a photography show. Compact, light-weight and easy to set-up, it worked well until another vendor bumped it. The easel came crashing down with my artwork. One of the two little edges that hold the display broke off. I'd recommend only lightweight documents or displays for this type of easel."
1,Would make a good movie,"Tom Clancy should stick with playing with his Tec-9 in the basement of his mansion, instead of pretending that he can write."
3,"Tom Clancy's ""Marine""",I enjoyed the non fiction but understand it's somewhat dated now. But it is difficult to find similar material especially here in New Zealand where my resources are lilmited.
5,Seen the movie Havana Mi Amor?,"Saw the film Havana Mi Amor at the Mill Valley Film Festival (great movie about romance Havana style, a TV repairman, and soap operas imagined and real) which features many songs by los Zafiros, and while it took me forever to figure out how to buy many of the songs from the film (on this CD), it has finally happened. So many sweet moments, and great to dance to!"
1,Don't be swayed by price,"Like other buyers, I was swayed by the Hoover's cheaper price, light weight, and the greater number of positive (to negative) reviews. I admit to loving this vacuum when it worked. Suction was really great on hardwood floors, ok on rugs, though not great on thicker ones even with the carpet setting. I liked the bagless feature, and didn't have an issue with disposal. Mine didn't die in a few months like others, but after 2 years. At first it overheated like a hair dryer and would just shut off. Now it overheats AND doesn't suck. Except it now *SUCKS* as a vacuum.So, if you are ok with paying this price for 2 years and then searching for another vacuum, it may be worth the gamble, but given that the model burns out unpredictably, I wouldn't recommend this."
1,Total POS!!!,"I should have listened to all the bad reviews. We've had this about 2 weeks, and the motor is dead. In theory, it is a great vacuum for light duty. I wanted something my kids could carry & use to vacuum their rooms. When the motor ran, it was so loud, with a penetrating piercing whine so awful my 8 & 10 year old had to wear ear protection."
2,over heats,this vacuum actually warms up the room a bit then after only a few minutes of use one of the motors will quit until the machine takes its time cooling again.
1,STOPPED WORKING after 3 brief uses!,"OH BOY, am I disappointed! I read all kinds of reviews (good and bad) before ordering this item, and thought that I had thoroughly done my homework. A word to the wise: DO NOT IGNORE THE OVER-HEATING COMPLAINTS!Well, back to the old drawing board. :("
4,decent,It was easy to assemble. Not to heavy and not to light when vacumming.. Picks the dog hair up on both carpet and hardwood floors.
4,Good little vacuum,It worked fine. It would be better if it could also have a pointed tube to reach corners and cracks.
2,motor broke,"This did an okay job as long as it lasted. On a positive note, it's compact device which is particularly useful in smallish apartments. The suction could be a bit higher, but it's alright. Unfortunately, the motor burnt out after only two years of light use."
4,Fantastic Light Duty Floor Vacuum,"Didn't expect alot from the Hoover Flair Bagless, because of the poor performance of previous types and models I have owned. This one exceeded all my expectations. It works great."
2,Second one just went out..,"The first one lasted a few years at most, but the belt drive system went out. The belt was fine (I replaced it), the problem was with the gears, they had bent and moved too close to each other to remain effective... the brush wouldn't spin at all.The replacement I bought three months ago just went out, same problem. Consumers shouldn't need to replace their stuff so readily, it becomes way too expensive. I'm thinking the manufacturing process has gotten worse between the two units I bought over the two years."
5,does the job perfectly,on hard wood floor it works great and also on pillows or blankets to pick up animal hair.Very satisfied with this purchase!
4,Stick does the trick,"I ordered this after getting a Dirt Devil Versa as the Versa was cheap, extremely light but didn't vacuum my rugs very well.Dislikes: dirt and dust fill up very quickly, gets quite hot after power is on more than 5 minutes.Likes: easy to unload and clean, locks in upright position, wheels turn in tight, harder to reach spots, and clean rugs and floors reasonably well.As a result, I will NEVER go back to a standard upright or canister vacuum, as the Hoover Stick Vacuum isn't a hassle to use and put away."
2,Stopped working after 3 months,"I was excited about this vacuum because I thought it would be perfect for vacuuming hardwood floors in my Manhattan apartment. It was great for a while, but three months after using it once a week, it burned out. Now I'm buying a more traditional vacuum. This seemed like a great buy but in the long run it's not."
3,"Worked great, that is until it stopped working","Worked perfectly for about 1 1/2 years.We have hardwood floors so we used this unit only for the rugs and the kitchen--I wouldn't call it heavy-duty use. 10 months after receiving the unit, the motor would overheat after about 10 minutes of use and it shut down on its own. Eventually, it just stopped working."
4,This stick vacuum really does the job!,"...i've used plenty of vacuums in my life and never had any luck with the stick types. But this one works great! It's got great suction on the wood and tile / stone floors. The carpet attachment works as well as any large upright. The light weight and compactness is what I was looking for. The only 'odd' part of this vacuum is where the cord wraps behind the handle, but it is not a problem. It's not too noisy and is easy to hang on a hook. But best of all, it has great suction!"
2,Lasted one year,"We purchased this item one year ago. It stopped working so we took it to an appliance center for repairs. Well, forget it. The switch was bad and because it is part of the circuit it would be $50 to repair. More than the cost in the first place. It did work well before it broke.Hoover S2220 Flair Bagless Upright Stick Vacuum with Power Nozzle"
5,If you are looking for a floor vac that works this is the one!!!,"After my old Eureka floor vac died from years of doggie hair I was besides myself, after a trip to Best Buy which left a bad taste in my mouth from the sales staff that ignore you, I was pleased to find this little red gem on Amazon. It swivels so doing the corners on my kitchen and hardwood floors in super easy, I know a few people said this one is so loud...they must have very sensitive hearing, if it is it's because it has A LOT of power to get the job done. Highly recommend this for anyone."
1,Good While It Lasted (Only 2 months!!),"This vacuum seem to have a MAJOR overheating problem. After less than 5 minutes of continued use, it overheats. There are no real symptoms besides its hot sides, but it dies after that. It is a really easy to use and relatively powerful vacuum, so I really liked it initially. However, when the first one broke down after 2 months (due to overheating), I actually decided to give it another chance by buying a new one since it seemed to have no other flaws besides overheating. But I was once again disappointed after the second one died in 2 months again, and this time, I was even careful not to use it continuously for more than 5 minutes. My fiance was vacuuming this time and did not know about it, so he used it for about 5 minutes, shut it off, went to the other room to continue vacuuming, but it just died. So, my recommendation is -- don't buy this if you use it more than an occasional mess cleanup because it is not made to vacuum a whole room without stopping."
1,Scratches hardwood floors,About two months after purchase it started to scratch my hardwood floors. It works great on tile but has made a mess of my hardwood. I tried everything and can't get it to stop scratching the floor. I wasn't impressed by the power brush feature either. Buy something else.
3,Not so good with dog hair....,"I purchased this product specifically because the reviewers were generally complimentary on its ability to pick up animal hair. Unfortunately, they didn't try it out in a house with my two dogs! The vacuum gets clogged up every 5-10 seconds, which requires me to turn the machine off, and remove the hair from the nozzle. I end up picking the clumps of hair off of the ground by hand, and then using the vacuum to do the light work. While it saves some time and effort over a broom, it is not what I had hoped for."
1,New China Owners Offers No Good Warranty Support,"Bought this for Christmas. Overheated after 15 minutes of use and overload protection shut it off so house would not burn down. Tried to get it replaced directly from the manufacturer in Canton, Ohio [I live 90 miles away in Cumberland Ohio] could not! Had to haul it 35 miles to an approved warranty repair center. That was +3 weeks ago. Folks at the repair center are really nice, even though I did not buy from them but must wait and wait for Hoover to honor their commitments. Still waiting as of 3/27/09! Vacuum worked well - sucking up dirt but, new non-american owners do not care about customer service. Want to Buy American? Then, do not buy Hoover! FJAD"
1,Surprising after reading all these good reviews,"I really researched vacuums before deciding to purchase this one based on the hundreds of positive reviews. First the lower two sections did not attach correctly. Then after emptying the dirt, the canister did not want to go back into place. I got it in place, and now I can't get it off again. Would not purchase."
4,Great Little Vacuum,I love this little vacuum and I've had several different brands. It's lightweight and powerful and I love the little swivel head. I love the fact that it has a floor and carpet setting because I have a large laminate floor with rugs and I can go right onto the carpet off my kitchen. It would be the perfect vacuum if it had a detachable hose!
3,Great for the first few months,"This unit was great for the first few months of use, but within a short time, suction started to fail. Wish I had purchased a better unit."
5,Happy in Ohio : ),"I just can't say enough ""GOOD"" things about this vacuum. It's so easy to put together a child could do it. It's light weight (going up and down the stairs with it is a breeze and what suction, it just picks up everything) and with the way it twist and tunes you never need to worry about how your going to get underneath anything to vacuum. G-d Bless the person who invented this vacuum. I'ed give this vacuum 10 stars if theyed let me.Evva Donofrio"
3,Little Vac,Light little vac that does a good job. Cleaning the filter can be tricky and gross though.
3,"Great quick clean,BUT","With a constantly shedding Lab,this is a great quick clean vac. It is light and very easy to maneuver around furniture.The on-off brush is a necessary feature with rugs as well as hardwood floors. BUT,the brush drive belt does not last long and is not user replaceable making the unit a throw-away model.Convenient belt replacement would make this a solid 5 star buy."
2,Over heats even in small apt....,"After using this hoover for a few months it seems to have come to the end! We have a small apt, few rugs but mainly hard wood floors and this hoover still overheats after one room. I never really liked it from the start - hard to get into corners and although small - can be heavy and bit uneasy to keep upright. It fell over once, hitting our white wall and left a very ugly red mark (from the paint) that wont come off. Usually love Hoover but this was a huge disappointment. Wont be buying it again."
4,very efficient,"its easy to use, it bends everyway possible, and its very light and small, making it easy to stow away. only problem i have with it is that there isnt a hose attachment for other areas besides the floor"
4,Hoover S2220 Flair bagless stick vacuum cleaner,Much easier to use than my fullsize Hoover. Really good suction and easy to clean after each use. Light and easy to push. Maneuverability is pretty good with the exception of getting into tight places and corners. All in all I would recommend. I vacuum more often now. Really like the way it picks up cat hair.
3,Be Prepared to Replace This Every 6 Months,"This vacuum works really well on hard surface floors for quick pickups. It has great power for a lightweight, easy to handle vacuum. It is NOT meant to replace a larger vacuum. I bought my first one in June 2008. The carpet function stopped working by August 2008. The company replaced the vacuum free of all charges. The replacement vacuum has stopped working - motor overheated and quit. After using an air compressor hose to thoroughly clean out the filter, it is now working once again. I use it primarily on hardwood floors to pick up dog hair. While the price is very reasonable and the product works well, I wonder if this isn't another example of products made outside of America that are meant to be used for a short period of time, thrown away and replaced. It costs more to ship this to the repair center than to buy another vacuum."
4,handy dandy,"It works great on wood floors and carpets, is lightweight, and easy to use. It also has a filter and is easy to empty."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!,"This vacuum sucks and I don't mean that literally, because 97% of the time it is useless! If you buy this vac, forget about waking up on a Saturday morning expecting to accomplish some house cleaning. I just turned the thing on and vacuumed ten square feet of my hardwood floor and it overheated. Each time it overheats, you need to let it cool down, which takes about an hour and then you have to go back, vacuum another tiny area, weep as it putters out again, wait another hour, and begin the process again. It has literally taken all week for me to vacuum my bare floors. Is there something caught in the nozzle or hose, you ask. Definitely not. I have checked more times than I can count. Hoover may have had he right idea, but this product fails miserably in my book. I give it a G!"
1,Horrible vacuum!,"This vacuum was trouble from the second I get it. It broke twice and to have it repaired almost two weeks after getting it, and my house is 95% hardwood floor! It is lightweight, which is about the only good thing I can say for it. Don't waste money on this, spend a little more and get a quality product!"
1,Burns out after 10 mins of use,"Ever since the 2nd or 3rd use, this machine over heats and stops running after about 10 minutes of use. Bad choice... go for the Roomba."
1,This Vacuum is LAME,"Like many others, I have a small apartment and was attracted to this smaller model of vacuum. On good days it works for about 10 minutes then burns out from over-heating. I've had it less than three months and am already looking for a replacement. Don't waste your time with this one, it's nothing but frustrating!"
2,Motor over heats,"This vacuum is great EXCEPT that this is my second one and they have both had the same problem - the motor overheats and it stops working, you have to wait for it to cool and then it works again. Very annoying and I am looking for a replacement. It is great on HW floors and does not scratch - when it works!"
5,Great value!,"My wife and I have been really pleased with this product. We've had it for about four weeks and use it to clean our hardwood floors. We have a chocolate colored hound dog that kindly leaves remnants of his coat across our floor... but with a quick clean with this vacuum, it's all gone in no time.The bagless feature is great and the vacuum is very light and easy to move about the house. It seems to get into corners well and even grabs the dirt right near the baseboards. It is also excellent for cleaning under beds and tables etc. For the money, I highly recommend getting this vacuum. Before this we were trying to get by with a little Dust Buster - but this think makes life so much easier and does a much better job of cleaning."
1,Not great,I have had this vac for a year. I too read these reviews and was thankful that there was a small and affordable option that had great reviews. It has been nothing but a disappointment. It has broken twice. The warranty just expired and it is not working again so I am on here looking for a new vac.
1,does not have the power to suck up even small light weight refuse on the floor,"I purchased this item mainly to clean dog/cat fur from my hardwood floors...I have short hair one cat and one short hair dog...within a few minutes of use, the nozzle was clogged and I had to stop and pull out a fur ball that had collected at the section where the wand and the floor nozzle connect...I have had this item for approximately a month and with each use I must stop and clean the nozzle every few minutes...Besides being frustrating, the time needed to clean my floors have trippled....I have trashed the item...the old fashion broom works better...Hoover Flair Bagless Upright Stick Vacuum with Power Nozzle, S2220"
2,OVERHEATS AND SHUTS DOWN QUICKLY,"If you're looking for something to pick up a few crumbs or some kitty litter in a 10 or 15 sq. ft. room, this would be adequate. It is otherwise extremely limited. I tried it in two small rooms, one with an area rug and the other with a ceramic tile floor. Before I was done it had over-heated and turned itself off. If you're trying to do a whole house, this is useless and Hoover should have made that clear in its advertising. It is light and it is powerful, but you can only run it for about 10 minutes before it goes to lunch."
2,disappointed customer,"When I first purchased this vacuum, I was excited and happy with the results but after using it several times, it started overheating if used more than 2 rooms. This is a real drag for me being that my whole house is tile and wood floors. Great at picking hair and fine dirt off floors. Not good with bigger items."
1,Disappointment!,"I read these Amazon reviews like they are straight from the Mount and they have never failed me until.....NOW! I have owned this vacuum cleaner for oh, maybe a WEEK, and it just made a horrible sound and died on me. I can't believe it. Now admittedly, I have three little ones and this Hoover already had quite the workout in the brief week we shared together, but come ON! I guess the old adage is true, you get what you pay for, at least for this family! I am glad it seems to be such a dream for everyone else."
4,Very handy,"I've had this vacuum for a little over a month. It has great power, and cleans carpet very well. It's adequate on my hardwood floors. I love the fact that it is bagless and I can empty out the collecting chamber whenever I feel like it.It's unfortunately a bit heavy. The design is made to get hard to reach areas (it pivots freely near the base), but this also makes it feel heavier. It would be helpful if there was a ""snap-in-place"" feature that didn't require you to push the entire weight of the vacuum around when you just want to clean a normal, flat area. This is also annoying for storage, as it doesn't stand upright on its own.All in all, though, it is a good deal for the money."
1,The WORST vacuum I have ever experienced.,"Handle swivels back and forth because it's so heavy and out of proportion to the base. Burns my legs as I vacuum. Only will pick up flat things. Dropped a bunch of small dog kibble. Could not pick it up. Has a tiny compartment for collecting dirt. Not for people with pets. Unless you live in a very cold climate (& need your shins warmed) and have virtually clean floors, this is not the vacuum for you."
1,Piece of junk,The parts did not attatch properly and when I called Hoover they said the nozzle was supposed to come preattatched to the body and I should have received two components when in fact I received three components. I called Hoover and they were less then helpful suggesting I get on a subway with the vacuum and take an hour and a half round trip to try and get the parts attatched which they could not have done. Amazon was terrific in arranging for a replacement however once again I was sent a vacuum with two parts instead of three. This time the parts did fit together at least but I can't help but wonder if I am receiving an older discontinued version of the vacuum.I barely used this item however the first time I used it on a heavy job it fell apart. Reminds me of a $5 hair dryer I once bought from a discount drugstore that I used twice and it broke. Look elsewhere.
3,Just OK,I was hoping or more but than again I guess I got what I paid for. It is a servicable vacuum for lomited cleaning but not up to heavy jobs. The charge does not last long and the suction wont pick up very well from inside grout lines. Best for smooth even surfaces like wood floors.Just Ok
4,Great for Apartments,"I purchased this to use in my apartment with wall to wall carpet. It takes up little space sucks up everything I can see and works quite well. It does get sort of hot after you have been using it, and I am having a hard time finding replacement filters for it. I like the mini beater feature but you have to clean long hair from it once and a while. Overall it does a good job for a tiny vac."
1,Piece of junk.,"I loved this vacuum when I first got it. The carpet setting worked great. After using it 2-3 times per month for 4 months it stopped working. I only use it on hardwood, tile and 2 doormats.It will turn on, have half-suction, spit dirt out for about 2 minutes and then just stop. After that it will only turn on for the carpet setting and the only thing that happens is the brush spins. It also makes a high pitched sound now.I have never had luck with Hoover products but because of the great reviews I tried this one. It has a one-year warranty but you need to take it to a service center that will send it to Hoover. If they determine it was a manufacturer's defect it will be replaced. Not worth the trouble for a $50 vacuum. And what do you use in the mean time?Very disappointed but not surprised."
2,"Flimsy and cheap, not for long-term use","We bought this vacuum two years ago when we replaced our carpeting with hard wood floors. I wanted something light to use on the hard woods to suck up dog fur and dust.I was initially very impressed. It did exactly what I wanted it to. Then I started noticing red scuff marks on all of my baseboards. The vacuum rubs on walls and leave red marks, so be careful! Then the vacuum tipped over once and the clip that holds the filter in broke. The wheels have started to lock up.We used it to vacuum an area rug in addition to the wood floors, and after a year the brushes stopped working. I guess you get what you pay for, and this vacuum sure was cheap!"
1,I Have Lost My Flair,"When I purchased this vacuum I was elated. It was perfect. It did exactly what I expected. Unfortunately, the power nozzle lost its power after only one month. In good news, Hoover was quick to send me another one within days. In bad news, 2 months later the power nozzle again lost its power. This vacuum was used periodically in my kitchen on dry light dirt (used primarily to catch dust bunnies from cat hair). I LOVED it when it worked, but I offer this vacuum only one star because because i could not count on it to work. A tool that is not reliable is not a tool. I will not be requesting another nozzle."
2,Filter clogs and motor overheats,"With a clean filter the vacuum does a good job on hard floor and carpet. However, the fabric filter quickly plugs with dust. Suction at the floor decreases substantially as the filter clogs which also reduces air flow across the vacuum motor. Since air flow drops so low, the motor overheats within a few minutes. I can get the vacuum to work only by washing the filter with soap and water after every use. That's really too much work so I bought a Hoover bagless vacuum as a replacement. The last stick vacuum I had, before it fell apart due to old age, used the same type of filter system and worked fine. Oh well."
2,housing plastic broke,"This sweeper worked well, until the plastic housing where it intersects the power head broke. Now it is junk after only about a year of use"
5,Just what I hoped for,"I had replaced another vacumm that had a user selectable brush with one that didn't even though it had decent reviews for picking up off area rugs. Well it didn't and I would have to use a regular vacuum to do the two area rugs we had. This was kind of tedious as most of our house is laminate except for the bedrooms and they get very limited traffic so once a week was all they needed with the regular full size vac.The laminate however I do every day alomg with the area rugs and the non brushed model just couldn't hack it. The Hoover Flair is just what the doctor ordered. Easy to put together, goes pretty low to get under low tables and entertainment centers and really has a strong suction. This in my opinion is one of hte best out there for the cost and the performance will not disappoint. Highly recommended."
3,Needs improvement,Does a great job of picking up on bare floors especially dog hairs. Would not recommend it on carpeting. My biggest negative is that this unit will not stand up on its own and you have to lay it down when you switch outlets.
2,"3+ Year Review, Not so good anymore","Bought this over 3, almost 4 years ago, to vacuum my 1,200 sq ft, one-floor house. I've got one wool rug in the living room, and a smaller one in the dining room, maybe 200 sq ft total. The rest of my house is wood floors and ceramic tile. This little Hoover used to work pretty well, I could usually manage to do a quick whole-house vacuum, minus the rugs. Now, I can barely get two bedrooms done without it shutting down due to overheating. Takes at least a half-hour for mine to cool down, sometimes more. I do keep filters clean, it certainly runs nicely when I start, but having to take a couple of long breaks during cleaning is just unacceptable. Maybe they are only meant to last a few years, maybe keep it around for just quick pickups. But will probably just trash it and look for something else. Ultimately, after 3 years, I'm disappointed."
4,not bad,This vac works fine enough. For the money it does what it is intended to do.Two points.1. It remains to be seen how it holds up.2.Ii dont like the way the power cord is connected to the body of the vac. There is a serious bend there.With that said it does a good job on hardwood which is what we bought it for.
5,happy pet owner,"This is a fantastic product. Lots of power. Picked up kitty litter and pet hair with one swipe. Love the fact that it is light, and yet swivels easily. Being able to switch from hard floor to carpet with the tap of switch is great."
4,It does the job,"This vacuum cleaner is easy to use and carry.. It's powerful for its size and does the job. It does not feel very strong and I don't expect to last very long, but I'm happy with this purchase."
1,would not take it if it was FREE,"A friend of mine told me how great this was, how wrong was she!!!!This vac. is nothing but CRAP!!! shuts off every min. you have to let it cool for five. If you are looking for a dust buster, maybe that is what it will be good for , I would not tell anyone to buy this, this thing is no even worth giving to goodwill. ( I have never wrote a review before, but I don't want anyone else to buy it, look at something eles. don't waste your money....some friend of mine HUH!"
1,Piece of Junk!,I purchased this because of all the possitive reviews. It will barely pick up a strand of cat hair! It is impossible to clean the rollers which everything gets wrapped around. My maid won't even use it. I have cleaned out every possible thing and it still won't pick up. When I go over a bump dust falls out the bottom! The other reviewers must own stock in Hoover. They should be ashamed to put that name on this item. I have never been more unhappy. Stay away!
3,filter dust bag,"no bags, but the filter (dust bag) for the motor is a pain to clean every time ! other than that it is a very good versatile sweeper."
3,Fine,"It works fine however the first and only use so far was in a camper and it completely stopped before finishing maybe a 8ft. by 10ft. area. I started looking and it states it will shut down if it over heats to let it off for about 30 minutes, it did start again but if it over heated that quick on such a small area I don't know if I could it's worth the money. As stated only tried it once and it is in the camper parked in the country so won't be using it again for a few weeks but if there are any changes I'll update my opinion......"
1,broke,it did not last more than two months even if we handle our stuff carefully. it was a disappointment. i do not recommend this brand
2,Not even one year.,"I was liking for sometime, easy to clean and then this morning in gonk out on me. Looking for waranty which is probably not 1yr."
2,Great while it lasted,"I loved this little vacuum as it was great for cleaning the first floor of my house, all wood and tile. I have a heavy duty one for the carpeted rooms 2nd floor. However, as with so many products today, it did not last. Died today after about 13 months of use (yes, the warranty is one year). I kept the bag emptied and the filter cleaned. I know it does not cost much, but I would think you could get more than 3 dozen or so uses out of a product before it dies."
1,Great when it worked,"I purchased this last year April 2011 and exactly a year after purchase, mine died. After all the reviews I read, I thought I would get at least a few more years out of this. I would definitely not buy again."
5,Convenient and powerful,"As soon as I assembled this and tried it out, I was amazed at how powerful this little stick vacuum is. I love that you can adjust it for different surfaces. If I have one complaint, it is the filter. It fills up rapidly, or maybe my house is just extra dusty and it is is a hassle to clean. I keep an old toothbrush handy and have to brush it thoroughly after each use. I have tried the rechargeable models and they worked well for a while, then the battery just doesn't keep a charge and it ends up in the garbage can. With this, I know that once I plug it in it will always be ready to go and do a good job. Also, if I would like to suggest to Hoover they make the electrical cord longer. It also gets hot rather quickly. I do tend to do the whole floor with and it is probably intended for small jobs. Hope I don't burn out the motor."
5,awesome!,"This is one of the best vacuums I have ever owned, suchion is awesome, can not believe the dirt that it picks up!!"
5,Dog hair Warrior,"I saw the Hoover Flair critique on Consumer reports and started searching for it to no avail in local stores. Got it on Amazon (should have started search there!) I am so happy. We have 3 dogs, all shed 24/7. The Flair is super lightweight and I need that because I have some health issues. It swivels, so manuverability is great! The cup is easy to empty, but for dog hair, keep a brush handy so you can brush off the filter. I've never had a vacumm perform so well and so efficiently; it makes housekeeping easier"
4,"Versatile, relatively light weight","The good: Cleans both hardwood and carpet, relatively light weight, easy to maneuver.The not so good: How am I supposed to clean the filter, seriously? I rinsed it with warm water, but still I had to clean it by hand, which was disgusting..."
4,Does a good job for it's purpose,"Not perfect, but it's good for light and occasional use. I really like that it swivels and can really get under furniture. Also, it's great that that it doesn't require a bag and all the muck can just get dumped into the trash can later. Only negative is that the bottom of the vacuum accumulates a lot of hair/dust/etc. and it has to be pulled out and cleaned after each use otherwise it's just not very effective for the next use. Overall, happy with this vacuum and its value."
2,Terrible quality!,This vacuum lasted for 1 month before it no longer worked. Now it just makes a hideous high pitched sound and doesnt vacuum anything. I also found the cord to be far too short to vacuum larger spaces without constantly unplugging it and moving to another outlet. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,good vac with a sreious flaw,While this vacuum has good suction the TWO machines we have purchased have both broken at the same spot- just above the power nozzle. The problem is that the machine is top heavy and necks down to the spot where they both broke even though they were not dropped. Furthermore the local Hoover repair center won't fix machines bought at Amazon.
2,broke after 3-4 months of weekly use,"As all the reviews indicate, this little vacuum works wonderfully, even on carpeted floors. However, it only lasted us 2 months of weekly use on carpet before it broke. There was plenty of dog hair in the carpet. I think it's a great buy... if you live near a repair center... unfortunately, we do not. :-("
4,Work well for its purpose,"Pros: handy, light weight, sexy looksCons: not useful for big or lengthy jobs.Its motor stops with overheat after 2 rooms of cleaning. Also the brushes at bottom get jammed very often.Otherwise its very handy and useful for small cleanings."
2,Lasted 1.5 year of limited use,"Had this vac since beginning of 2008. Was used mainly for kitchen /living room on one floor. A few weeks ago, the suction stopped working and the plastic handle cracked where there is a bolt holding the body and head together. Worked well for a while."
4,very handy,so far this little vac is pretty handy. i wish it had a larger dirt cup but i like it much better than hand vacs and definitely worth the money!
1,MRS,This product stop working after my third vacuum. I only used it to vacuum the carpet in a small room.
2,"great vacuum, but doesn't last",When I first bought this vacuum in Jan it worked like a charm. By June it started performing poorly. Sometimes it stops in the middle of vacuuming. I would not recommend it. Buy a small car vac instead.
2,Not as strong,"This is a great little vacuum for touch ups. But not what I was looking for; it's not a small sized full vacuum. It does not get anything up that's between floor boards. But, for what it is, it's easy to assemble, easy to use. I can say that :)"
5,"Quick, Light and Effortless!!","I purchased this stick vacuum for my hardwood floors. It does a great job and can be used without a beater bar so no scratching the finish of the floors. It is quick and handy to use on a daily basis and makes my job easy. It's so much better than having to drag out a big, cumbersome vacuum. I rate this stick vacuum 5 stars and don't think you'll regret it if you purchase it!"
4,put away your broom,"amazing little product. only reason it got a 4 is the CORD is too short and it's just alittle bit bulky but other then that... it's like all the other reviews say, you'll be amazed at how much it picks up. You do have to empty it each time but NO bags!"
2,"It`s good, but....","I was happy to use this vacuum for less 1 year, but if this one`s nozzle would be broken or something critically happen...You`d better buy new vacuum...There is no reason to wait 4~6 weeks to replace a broken nozzle with new one with around $30..."
5,Excellent Product,Great for bare floors. Like the feature where you turn the brush roll off for bare floors. Great for quick picker-upper of small items on carpet but too small to be a whole house vacuum. The swivel head is a great help in getting around chairs and other items. I bought it for use on bare floors as we have a lot of sand here and gets tracked in the house and does and excellent job. I would recommend this to all who is looking for one for bare floors.
1,Great vaccum but short life. Not worth it.,"This was the second vacuum I purchased after the first one died (roller brush belt) exactly 12 mos. after purchase. For $49, I thought the cost of ownership was worth another try.So I bought another one mid-January. Died mid April. The ""costs"" of returning it to Amazon or getting a warranty replacement far outweigh the benefits of getting another one. Owning Hoover vacuums for ever, this poorly constructed product truly diminishes the overall brand and it's likely I'll not purchase another Hoover after this experience. Caveat Emptor."
1,Good until the power head got permanently jammed with hair,"This vacuum worked excellently, although ran a little on the hot side, until what I will describe as the ""bearing"" for the spinning brush in the power head got completely tangled with hair. This happened twice, the first time I was able to cut away the hair and restore the vacuum to normal operation. The second time, I disassembled the entire power head and the hair was so firmly embedded in the ""bearing"" that it was impossible to remove. I suspect that the friction between the hair and the bearing caused the hair to melt into the bearing itself. The vacuum should be designed so that the ""bearing"" is not exposed to debris.I would recommend this vacuum for light cleaning duties, but if you have a pet I would avoid this product."
1,Died After Three Uses; Do Not Buy If You Have Long Hair!!!,"I have a tiny studio apartment (read: not much space to be covered by a vacuum) and the only substances I needed the vacuum to consistently pick up were hair and feathers from a down comforter. This vacuum failed miserably.If you have long hair, stop reading this review now and find another vacuum immediately! My boyfriend and I both have long hair, and this vacuum could not handle it. Hair gets caught in the bristles, and the only effective technique for removal involved cutting the hair with a knife and then yanking it the rest of the way out of the bristles. Not pleasant.Another complaint: I found out the hard way that this vacuum does not like to stand upright, and I have red marks on my walls from the handle falling over to prove it.In a nutshell, DO NOT buy this vacuum!!!"
2,Good vacuum but broke after 2 months,"Good vacuum, light, great for a small NYC apt. But the damn thing stopped working after 2 months. Specifically, the fan that causes the suction burned out. Not happy!"
2,Not so hot,"I thought this Flair was great when I first got it. Then after a while, it would get hot if using it a while and the thermostat would shut it off. The suction seemed to dwindle, despite replacing the filter with a new one. Eventually the lousy plastic engagement part of the head assembly wore to the point that the head would fall off.A great electric broom to start, just don't expect it to last."
2,BE WARNED IN ADVANCE,"I just want people to be aware! I purchased this vacuum in Nov. '08...not quite a year ago, and loved it for a month or two, seemed to be perfect for me.(I live in a one bedroom apt. with wood floor and a small area rug, so there is no heavy work here.) Then the bottom of the vacuum (literally) fell off...It whole brush/cleaning area is attached, it appears, by one thin rubber piece..and it sort of twists on....I have screwed it back on dozens of times, (not being able to afford a new one right now) and even duct taped it, only to have it fall off again. I guess there is just no way to fix it. So, sometimes a bargain turns out to not be a bargain! I gave it two stars for the two months it worked well."
4,Great for picking up cat hair,"With four cats in the house, the vacuum cleaner doesn't always get up everything. I was surprised and pleased to see what the Flair picks up from corners and hard-to-reach places.It would be good if the Flair had the ability to stand upright by itself when left momentarily during the cleaning cycle. It can be awkward trying to find a place to prop it up against when I don't want to return it to its hook in the closet."
2,Very Heavy,"I bought this unit hoping for a lightweight vacuum to do spur of the moment cleaning, but it is as heavy or heavier than a standard upright.I was very disappointed. It also does not perform very well. Only positive thing is that it has a fairly long cord for a portable vac."
2,hoover flair bagless stick vaccum,"This unit will vaccum hard surface floors, but when on carpet the beater brush motot will stop turning. The small electric motor that drives the beater brush is to small and over heats and stops. I wouldn't but this unit again."
3,"Great power, but not durable","I am on my second vacuum and after a little over one year of almost daily use, the plastic connecting to the nozzle broke. Now is on duck tape until I find another replacement, but it won't be another Hoover. BTW, the first one broke the same way."
1,Save your money,"I bought this vacuum in September, it started out pretty decently. However, very poor suction after just a few months and it broke. I have hardwood floors and a few oriental area rugs that need the vacuuming, so it was not purchased for anything heavy duty to begin with. Buy something else, you'll regret it otherwise."
4,Hoover Flair S2220,"I really like my Hoover Flair - does what it needs to do and as long as you don't use it on long carpet (can get overheated - should have airflow to work well) and stick to flat surfaces mostly and short rugs, you're fine. It's quick, easy, light and stores anywhere. Take it places with me (took to work and used there) and my 7-yr old son can use it to clean his room. Have always had a more expensive, big vacuum and I was so sick of dragging that thing out to clean. If you have hardwood floors,tile, linoleum, etc. this is a great tool and will save you tons of time. It's also an awesome price...the best part."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"The excellent suction drags unsuspected dirt and more cat fur than anticipated from Oriental carpets. Love being able to press a switch and turn on or off the brushes. Long cord. Easy to maneuver. Exactly what I wanted.UPDATE: While it worked, it was wonderful. Today, roughly a year after I purchased it, this vac has just lost its suction. It was well cared for and lightly used, but it has simply stopped. The brushes still turn, but without suction they just spit out the accumulated dust and dirt. Now I have to buy another vac, and it will not be a Hoover."
3,hoover review,this product is a lit;tle heavier than my last electric broom and has only one setting
5,Great for bare floors!,I ordered this for the bare floors in my home. It works great on them and the suction is very strong that it does the runner rugs good. Love it!
1,Only lasted 6 months :(,This started out as a good little vacuum for our hard wood floors. After only 6 months it completely stopped working. It will not longer pick up anything. We opened it and cleaned it all out but nothing worked. We only used it in a very small area so we are disappointed it worked for such a short while!
2,"Good start, bad finish...","I first bought this at the end of August 2011. Worked ok the first few times I used it - low noise, did ok on most of my carpet, but the brushes didn't really do a phenomenal job on the white cat hair on my dark area rug. Also, the motor seemed to get very hot.Just a couple of weeks ago (mid-December) the vacuum died - it still makes noise when it is turned on, but there is no suction & the brushes don't spin."
5,Great for quick cleanup.,I purchased this to do quick cleanups in the kitchen after our family of six. We used to use a smaller Shark sweeper but it just couldn't keep up to the daily demand. This vac does extremely well on the hardwood due to its powerful motor and does well enough for touch-up jobs on the carpet and rugs.
5,the best vaccuum for the price for my bare floors!!,I love my hoover bagless flair. Best suction. I will keep buying it each time it breaks because I put it through vacuum hell. It's the best vacuum out there for the money! I tried the electrolux ergo rapido. Seemed convenient. Really nice and sharp looking but suction is not good. This time I will try the 1 year warranty though!
2,Died after a year,"I was very happy when I got this Vacuum because it's made by Hoover, therefore, reliable and because it's slim (easy to carry around) and at a great price. I have a tiny apartment with wall-to-wall carpeting. I didn't know they weren't meant for such cleaning. After a year of use, the hoover now overheats after just a few minutes of cleaning the carpeted floor, even with a clean filter and nozzle. A huge disappointment. I wish there were clearer notes about the use with carpeted floors. So now I'm gonna have to pay to get a new vacuum!"
2,Doesnt hold up,I kept this vacuum in the upright postion most of the time. After many uses mainly on kitchen floor only the neck of the base area began to crack. After only 1 yr of use it broke off completely. I am not hard on my vacuums and have had the eureka smart boss for 4 years. I love that vacuum. Im going to try the eureka floor vac next for my kitchen. Do Not buy this item if you dont want to replace it year after year.
2,"Good for small jobs on hard floor, not carpet","At first I really liked the small form factor and light weight of this vacuum. It does well on the hard floor of my kitchen, entryway, and bathroom. But the rest of my 2BD apartment is carpet and this thing will not even pick up surface lint. It also seems to overheat. Cleaning out the container well enough to keep good suction is also a real pain, but that is probably true with any bagless. Bottom line - good for spot cleaning on hard floor, nothing else."
2,"Great vac, but doesn't last long","I loved this vacuum while it worked, but it only lasted about 18 months. The brush stopped turning. It was also very prone to overheating, so I'd often have to stop and let it cool down before finishing (note that I have ceramic tile floors and was vacuuming an area around 900 sq ft.). Despite the overheating, the vacuum worked pretty well...until it just stopped. My attempts to fix it didn't work."
4,Best Lightweight Vaccuum Available/Lasted a Little Over a Year,With 3 kids and 2 cats we vacuum A LOT. This is great for everyday vaccuuming and perfect for those with hardwood floors and area rugs. We love how powerful this vaccuum is for it's size and weight. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and it's been much easier to vaccuum with this.Cons:- Tips over too easily while standing.- Long hair can cause some problems over time by wrapping around - something we didn't have happen with any other vaccuum.- Only lasted a little over a year. I was hoping for about 3 yrs...
1,Waste of Money,"We have a retail shop with concrete flooring. We only vacuum on occasion. So, it was about 4 months when we realized this does not work. We used it about 4 times before it quit working altogether. By the time I realized it was really broken, it was too late to return it.I would not recommend this product."
1,Broken in just a couple of months.,"I bought this vacuum for my college dorm. It has very flat carpet and is only a 165 square feet room. Somehow, this vacuum managed to break in about two months of very mild use (vacuuming once a week). Now, it makes a very loud noise while it picks up very little and smells up the whole room with that typical, horrible vacuum smell. It was great for the first two months, though, I just don't possibly see why it should have done this so quickly. They do have a warranty which allows you to get it fixed in a store, but unfortunately, the store is quite far away and I have no time to take it. I feel like I really wasted my money on this one."
1,Broke and amazon won't honor a return,"This vacuum has a snap in the clear filter holder. The snapping part is a small black piece of plastic. I ordered this on November 22, 2010. This small black plastic piece broke off last week. I just missed the January 31st deadline for returns. I guess it's 60 days. But the vacuum should be guaranteed because it's really new. I like Amazon, but this annoys me a lot. BEWARE this Hoover and Amazon's return policy."
5,Great little vacuum!,"I love this vacuum - works very well, is portable, and navigates well around furniture. Has great suction and the rug beater works well too. Best little vacuum around!"
1,hate it!,"My husband brought this for me. He didn't know what to look for in a vacuum. Just like the guys who designed this beauty... he never hoovers.Hoover should bring back their old, ugly, blue quick broom! The flair doesn't compare. It's nozzle is not wide enough, so it takes twice as long to vacuum. Long hair gets caught up in the roller brush, so every couple uses you have to turn it over & cut the hair out b/c it gets clogged up. Debris never drops into the cup, it sticks to the filter. I clean it out w/a toothbrush after each use. Doesn't that sound gross? It's supposed to stand up, but always falls over. I hate it, but it sure is pretty. I'm giving it to my son when he goes to college. I'm sure he'll never use it."
1,Hoover Vacuum,I thought this was going to be a great vacuum reading all the reviews. It didn't work right from the beginning. Nothing would suction into the canister. I bought it just to vacuum up dog hair in my bedroom. I have wood floors. When I used it all the dog hair stayed at the bottom where the rollers are. I would have to peel the hair off. After a few weeks I had my husband take it apart and he found a little piece of plastic broken off. I didn't return it because they will only give you half off and I would have to pay the postage which wouldn't be cheap.I feel like I was very ripped off. I would really like a refund!!!
3,"Okay, lasted about 29 months","They definitely do not make these like they used to. Loud, tended to leave behind lots of dust and particles. Flimsy, cheap, and plastic feeling. Tended to run hot if I vacuumed more than 10 minutes. After a couple of years it quit sucking, made a horrible sound, and died. I wish they made something more solid and longer lasting. I cannot recommend this particular vacuum cleaner. Not happy at all. The price was right though. Okay product if you only expect it to last 2 years and do not vacuum consistently for more than 10 minutes."
4,Mrs,"I was looking for a light weight vacuum for everyday use. The Hoover Flair bagless S2220 seemed to be the right one from the reviews I read. It took about 10 minutes to put together and seems to work just great. I especially like the fact that you can choose to have the brush bar on or off.Have a cat and dog and it does a great job picking up fur and hair(people) from wood and vinyl flooring; and also off all my short pile area rugs. I clean the dust cup/filter out after each use and sometimes twice if doing upstairs and downstair floor/rugs. Also this product is great for doing wood stairs and short capeted stairs; I have both and it is light enough to go up or down stairs.Have only owned it about 3-4 weeks; so far so good.Thanks Amazon, you did have the best price!Thanks Hoover!My mom has the Flair (I beleive) S2000 which doesn't give the option of the the brush bar."
1,a piece of junk,This had really really bad suction the food got stuck in it. I was also very loud. I sent it back.
2,"Flimsy, cheap, don't waist your money!","I purchased this based on the reviews on this site, but I don't think this unit deserves more than two starts. It is so flimsy and breaks easily; mine broke in less than a month."
5,Great,"This Vacuum is great. You do have to clean it out quite a bit, but that is only because it does such a great job cleaning!"
2,Brush Stopped Working After 2 Weeks,"I was very happy with the product initially and used it frequently--perfect for my townhouse. However, after only a couple of weeks the brush stopped working. Because this vacuum is designed cheaply, I could not take it apart to inspect the belt. I suspect that this is the problem, but now I will have to go through the hassle of trying to contact someone in customer service and very likely will have to make a trip to one of the Hoover service centers to get this fixed. What a pain! I guess you get what you pay for--but I was hoping for a bit more than this."
1,broke after a few months,These other people must have wrote their reviews before having it a while... This is junk.
5,Floor sweeper,I bought this floor cleaner cuz I got tired of sweeping the floor with a broom. Originally I bought a rechargeable one and it was great for about a month till the battery started to lose its charge and would only work for about 3-4 minutes before it died. I bought it cuz I didn't want to have a cord attached but after that experience I decide to look for one that has a cord. I love it little vac. It's super powerful. It does my floors and even my rugs through out the house. But like others say the cord is short and I do have to unplug it and replug it back in just about every room I go into. I also bought the Hoover steam mop and its cord is crazy long and it works great also. Great combo for floor cleaning.
1,Really useless vacuum.,I would not buy this again. One has to push the head down with every movement back and forthSuction is OK but otherwise useless
5,"Works Great! Won't do ""shag"" bathroom rugs, but worth the $$","Just did a test clean in my house and it worked great, mostly...The power head won't do my ""shag"" bathroom rugs --the motor binds... But I can do a decent job by not using the power head and dragging the vacuum over the rug while holding the far edge of the rug down with my foot. I'll shake out my bathroom rugs outside, or wash them in the washer, when I wan them really clean...After 10 minutes, I was AMAZED of how much dirt was picked up! And DO clean the the filter OUTSIDE as there IS a lot of dust that flies when you shake and brush off the filter.And BE gentle with the vacuum! It's plastic and it's $50... It's not a $400 commercial unit but does a GREAT JOB around the house.I have a 20 yr old $400 Sears canister that's a work-horse, but is clunky for quick once-overs... I like the maneuverability of this stick vac!And if I get 2 years out of this vacuum, it's well worth it!"
5,My wife loves it!,My wife uses it every morning. Cleans up the utility room because we keep the cats in this room at night. She is very pleased as it is lightweight and works well on the steps.
5,Powerful!,"Light and powerful, this fits the bill as a second vacuum on my second floor. Performs well on ceramic and rugs. No more lifting the heavy vac up the stairs,"
5,Better than Eureka,"Good vacuum. The Eureka I had was less than a year old. Although the Eureka I had was cordless, The corded Hoover should last a lot longer than a year."
2,Spits out dirt when switching carpet-bare floor mode,"I bought this due to the good review on Amazon, but was not very impressed with it. It spits out dirt when switching between carpet and bare floor mode, which defeats the purpose of vacuuming. Also it seems to overheat easily and will shut off while vacuuming. It does pick up dirt well on rugs and has good suction, but is very loud and kind of heavy for a stick vac.."
1,Broken in 2 after 14 months of light use,"This vacuum cleaner works decently. Nonetheless, it is very heavy to carry around and suffers from a quick loss of suction. All the hair and large dust get stuck in the brush (we have hardfloor and no pets) and reduces the efficiency of the vacuum. Similarly, the bagless system only works for large particles. All the finer particles will get trapped in the filtering membrane, requiring wet washing every 2-3 uses (as per the manual).The main flaw with this product is its robustness: after 14 month of very mild usage (we live in a small apartment) the head broke loose from the rest of the vacuum cleaner. Warranty is over so the cleaner is pretty much useless. We will not buy a Hoover vacuum cleaner again."
4,Bought for easy clean up,"Originally I was looking at cordless stick vacuums but realized they were just dust busters with a long handle. Went with this instead and I'm very pleased with it. We have all hard surface (tile and wood) floors with area rugs and I wanted something light and easy for quick clean ups instead dragging out my canister or upright. This vacuum has great suction, cleaned the edges, and the carpet setting really picks up the cat hair on the rugs. The rotating brush on the carpet setting is too powerful for light throw rugs. The suction is so good that I have to rinse the filter often because it picks up so much! Easy to empty the debris holder. Fits in a corner of the pantry and so is close at hand."
4,"Hoover Bagless Stick vacuum with Power Nozzle, S2220",We love our new Hoover in terms of its powerful cleaning action and good design. It does a great job cleaning small area rugs. The only small problem is the noise level when cleaning rugs. We initially thought that there was a problem with the motor and so requested a replacement brush unit. This produced the same result so the noise is probably related to the strong rotating brushes when being used on rugs.
3,I Have an Unhealthy Relationship with This Little Vacuum,I have been through 4 of theses since 2007. The problem is that it works GREAT but is so fragile!! I broke all 4 because the joint to the nozzle snapped off. I kept thinking I was being too rough but I think it is a design flaw. I suffer the insanity of doing the same thing and expecting it to turn out different. LOVE LOVE LOVE this vacuum but it just does not hold up at all!
1,Already gone through the 2nd Hoover Flair,"The first one lasted a little over a year with just light cleaning around the house, but the second one was even less. Probably not used even a dozen times, and already a fail. I say no more investment in these vacuums, it's like buying them and give'm away. Boo to Hoover."
1,It took us a while to realize it wasn't really sucking anything up,Doesn't suck well and gets easily clogged. Within a year ours had stopped working completely and we had to get a new vacuum.
4,Great product for light cleaning.,"It's a very good product. Two things could be improved: the long Stick that tends to fall over frequently and the bag isdifficult to clean. It's light, and has great suction. Good for quick pick-me ups."
3,Heavy and loud,"I have a small house with hardwood floors and I want a quick, light vacuum. This vacuum feels heavy to use, and is much louder than other small vacuums I have owned in the past. I used this vacuum once and returned it. Just not for me."
5,Good vacuum - inexpensive & light,"I have hardwood floors and am 8 months pregnant, so I needed a vacuum that was light to move around, easy to store, and not too expensive. This fits the bill. Since I don't have carpets, can't tell you how this cleans carpets, but it definitely picks up the grit on the floor & is easy to use. Would recommend it."
1,hoover flair power head vacuum,great for vacuuming floors and rugs I've had 2. The first one the brush stopped working after 11/2 years. Thaught it was a bad vacuum so I purchased a second one the brush stopped working after 1 1/2 years .Needless to say I do not recommend this stick vacuum.
2,"Great, until it broke","After 4 months, the suction motor stopped working on this Hoover vac. Maybe I ended up with a lemon, but there's several other commends on repair sites and other blogs complaining about this same problem. The brushes still run, but there's no suction at all coming from the vac. At most, I used it once a week for 10 or 15 minutes.I loved it until now, but I don't think I'll be getting another one."
2,Not Worthy of the Hoover Name,"I have had many Hoover vacs over the years and I hoped this one would be the answer for my wood floors. I use my uprights for the large rugs but need a smaller, easy to use vacuum for the wood.I read the reviews and even though they were mixed, I was optimistic....Big mistake! My complaint is that it is impossible to keep the head on the vacuum stick...It just does not fit properly.I think the suction is okay and the cup is easy to clean. That is the only reason I gave a 2-star rating."
4,Stick Vacuum Does the Job,"The Hoover S2220 Flair Bagless Stick does all that it promises, and all that I need. It is ideal for smaller jobs instead of dragging out the big machine. And having a brush/beater in such a small unit is a great bonus."
4,Hoover Flair Vacuum,"I purchased the Hoover Flair Bagless Upright Stick Vacuum for quick little clean-up jobs. I have wood floors with low pile area rugs in some areas. The Flair makes clean-up after my grandchildren a breeze. It is compact, lightweight and easy to manipulate. I choose this model over a cordless because it has a long cord that lets me access my kitchen and family room area with ease. Just make sure that you empty the container frequently. It is a little messy, but I like not having bags since it is more environmentally friendly."
5,GREAT FOR CAT OWNERS ! -^.^-,"No kidding, I have lots of cats and this little vacuum works better than some of the more expensive ones. Yes, you may have to empty the dirt cup more often, but it cleans the rugs/floors great. Highly, HIGHLY recommended!"
1,DON'T BOTHER,"This is my second purchase of the same vacuum cleaner. When part of the nozzle on the first one broke I thought I had damaged it by not being gentle enough. I purchased another one because I liked the fact that it was light, flexible and compact. My second one broke in exactly the same place. This product is delicate and not for use by anyone who intends on cleaning more than once a month. It is still under warranty but it costs me more to drop it off at the repair shop so I will have to buy a brand new vacuum. What a waste of time and money!!!I will NEVER buy this model again. It is useless."
5,Awesome!,Purchased this item for my mother-in-law after her sweeper quit of eight+ years. She is 83 and the Hoover is still managable in weight and size. She is a clean freak and loves what a great job this vacuum does in between vacuuming with the larger Dyson. We have three pets and she says this still handles the pet hair.
5,VERY SATISFIED,YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH A HOOVER PRODUCT.THE STORES WERE ALL OUT AND I NEEDED THIS. WHAT BETTER WAY THAN TO ORDER AND RECEIVE AT MY HOME. WORTH THE MONEY AND IS VERY STURDY. WORKS WELL TOO.
2,Good Little Vacuum...until it broke!,"I bought this vacuum based on the wonderful reviews it received. I thought it would be perfect for our small 2 bedroom apartment. Less than 2 months after buying it, it broke. Hate to be a downer after all the great reviews, but I would not recommend this vacuum. It is definitely not a quality vacuum, but I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Had to return it.,"I had to return this vacuum because the tiny three way switch is a bad design. The off position works as does the carpet position, but the floor position in the middle would not stay there. It just went to carpet which was no good for my hardwood floors. OTherwise it would have been just fine."
2,Didn't Last Very Long - Even With Very Limited Use,"Have had the vacuum since late July 2007 and today (May 31 2008) it ""died""...I have been using it once a week for Bathroom/Kitchen floors only - guess companies just don't make things like they used to. Will try to find a new alternative other than Hoover."
5,Fabulous for the price...,"I'm using this in my vacation home to pick up after my dog, my cat and around my cat's litter box. It does a great job. In fact it does a better job than I expected and I think I'll always have one just to pick up after the kitty's litter. The only thing I don't like is cleaning the inner filter every time I use it, but it's really necessary to do that in order to keep the great suction going. I don't know how in the world it could be better designed for the price. And I love the cherry red color - it actually makes vacuuming kind of fun!"
5,Great little sweeper,"I love my little Hoover Flair. Most things aren't as good as advertised, but this is! I've learned over the years not to expect much of an inexpensive vacuum, but this turned out to be a pleasant surprise. It's exactly what I needed. It's light weight and easy to use and even seems to have more power than my older, much bigger canister vacuum. With its swivel nozzle it gets into tight places easily and has a long enough cord to get from one room to another in my small house. I recommend the Flair for anyone with pets. I have a combination of cats and old carpet, and this inexpensive little sweeper is just what I needed. The only drawback is that it heats up quickly, so it isn't meant to be used to vacuum large areas at one time. It is exactly what it is advertised to be -- a stick vacuum for quick clean-up jobs anywhere in the house."
4,love it!,"this is my very first new vacuum, so i don't have a lot of basis for comparison, but had to buy it after i read the reviews. it's fabulous! sucks up everything so well, super easy to clean, not a lot of dust when you open it. i am moving to an apartment with wall to wall carpeting and will see how it holds up... but on the hardwood at my current house, it got all the rooms, and barely even got hot. love it."
1,Flair Stick Bagless S2220,"This vac worked about 10 minutes before it began to overheat and would not work on the bare floor setting. The vac will stand up on it's own, but would likely fall over if bumped and break the plastic cord holder if it hits a hard surface. Poor quality and design. It is definitely not worth the $50 price. If this item was free, I would not take it. I would buy a broom instead. Do not buy this product!"
3,Cute but not long lasting,"I bought this after reading several reviews and thought I'd give it a whirl. It was great for the first couple of months. It's really slim and doesn't take up much space anywhere which is great, and the fact that you don't have to buy bags is a plus. The roller brush stopped working on me today, hopefully it's just a belt. I'm pretty disappointed though because we haven't had it that long and we only have carpet in our living room, so it's not like it was having to work very hard on a regular basis."
1,where do i return to? after 7 uses its loud and stops altogther,"ok bought on april 15th, its now june 4th. I turn it on, its LOUD, HOT HEAT radiating off it, then stops working after 5 minutes?? I will be calling hoover tomorrow to see what can be done? I threw my reliable bissell lightweight out after the handle broke. 3 years later! Still had good suction though. I'm very dissapointed with this purchase. To top it off i have 2 rugs in a 2 bed apartment. So not like theres lots of work to be done. Dont bother with this junk, especailly if you have carpet!"
5,All time favorite,"I absolutely love this little vacuum! It is so easy to use, lightweight and powerful. The suction, even on rugs, is great. I liked the first one so much that I ordered a second."
3,Hoover Flair,"Hoover Flair is heavier than I thought it might be and a little hard for me to manage. However, it does a great job of picking up crumbs and litter on the kitchen floor. I am sure I will get used to having to empty the bag after every use."
2,Broken Again,"I ordered 2, both of which had a wheel which didn't spin. I couldn't get it to roll on the floor. It was a major disappointment since I owned one, which I loved, but which burned down in my apartment. Wish I couldn't gotten one that worked."
5,Strong little vacuum,"This vacuum is much stronger than my previous Hoover. I don't have to go over the same area multiple times anymore. We have two dogs and twin two year olds. Needless to say, I vacuum everyday! I love how the power nozzle swivels so you can get around dining room chairs without moving everything. It does a nice job with carpet also. It is easy to empty out and I feel the cord is long enough. Being able to see in the collection cup is nice because you know when to empty it out. My mom and my grandma own the same vacuum! They love their Flairs just as much as I do!"
5,Update- A (not so) excellent Replacement,"I should've listened to the other disappointed customers- The power nozzle just stopped working & it's less than a year old. My apartment is relatively small & it takes me about 15 minutes to vac the carpeted areas, but the heat this vac throws apparently was the cause of the motor dying. Boooo...Next time, I'm paying attention to the other reviewers' warnings.You know- I did purchase a second one of these. About a year ago. And it just died. I miss it already. This vacuum is GREAT, but it's life is short. The motor goes out and if the engineers could extend the use, it'd be the *perfect* apartment/small-home vac.I love the attributes so well that I'm buying something that I know will only last one year... I expect ""things"" to be back to normalcy by then. :) Maybe a bigger home & vac."
1,Worst stick vac ever,I've had quite a few stick vacs over the years and can say without hesitation this is by far the worst one I've ever had. The base where dirt is picked up has brushes that catch dog hair which then never gets sucked up into the vacuum and eventually it all needs to be pulled out manually. If you have dogs or cats this vaccum is not a good choice. The suction power is substandard and the only thing going for this vaccum is its good looks!
1,It broke within the first 5 minutes!!!!,"I was very, very disappointed in this stick vacuum!! It started rattling and the belt broke within the 1st five minutes!!! The belt is only serviceable or replaceable by a Hoover authorized service center. Yuk!!!!!!!!"
4,Reasonable for the price,"This replaced a broken Electrolux Pronto. My main goal was to find something that is light and does not take too much space to store. On the plus side, it cleans much better than the cordless Pronto. On the minus side, the cord is a bit short, so I have to stop and move the plug once or twice when cleaning."
4,it's really good.,"the hoover flair is money. this thing sucks like a back-alley trick and will have you floors looking great.i bought this specifically for hard-wood floors which i have through-out my house and it does a bang-up job on dirt, animal hair and dust balls. It's also light enough that you can pop it up onto furniture.I think the downside is that it's a little fragile. You can't bang this thing around, something will break. Treat it nice."
3,"Decent, but overheats","I would like to highlight an area some on this review page, and some on other sites, have mentioned. This vacuum is prone to overheating, typically when the power nozzle (beating brush) runs for a while. I used the vacuum without that happening for 18 months but twice it has overheated when the beating brush has been turned on for an extended period. I find that the vacuum is pretty good at picking up stuff from hardwood floors, but I discovered it actually worked a little better on hardwood with the brush turned on. Well, so much for that option. In short, don't get this if you have a lot of rug area. If technically feasible, I wish Hoover would spend about $10 more (and raise the price correspondingly) and solve the overheating problem."
1,Hoover Broom Vacuum,"Good power, good cornering, light weight. What I don't like about it is the filter that you have to dump out. It makes a huge mess and I have to get my hands dirty to clean it out. It makes a high pitch noise when it get's a certain amount of dirt in it. It was not near full when I noticed the noise. I emptied it out anyway and the noise stopped. It comes and it goes. It serves it's purpose well but I rated it a three star because of the inconvienance of emptying it out the noise that it makes. If you want a broom vac with power and cleans corners well and you can overlook getting dirty and making a mess than you will not be disappointed with this vac. **UPDATE** terrible vacuum! It overheats and quits and you have to wait for it to cool off. Do not waste your money on this vacuum."
4,I love this vacuum,"This is a great little vacuum for quick jobs. It won't take the place of a regular full size vacuum, but I have found that I can cut down my use of the full size vac to one a month (no pets, only one teenaged daughter)."
4,Handy,This is a handy little vacuum! It is great for picking up cat litter off of bare floors and the swivel makes is easy to maneuver. It easily gets under furniture that an ordinary vacuum would not fit under. I just wish it was a little wider because it is not practical to use on whole rooms of tile.The filter is hard to clean if you have pets. The cat hair sticks to it like crazy...
1,Bagless Vacuum,"This is a stick vacuum, but has one problem in that the ""bagless"" feature is dependant on a Small filter that fills very quickly and then suction almost stops. This is nothing like the old Hoover stick vacuum I had in the past and I am frankly disappointed with the product."
4,"Good, light vaccuum","I bought this vaccuum for our kitchen and sunroom floors as we have 2 dogs that shed a lot. We have the kids do the vaccuuming and it is so easy with this vaccuum. The only complaint is that some of the hair does get caught on the roller on the bottom rather than being sucked up, which is a bit annoying. But it is definitely worth the money."
4,Works well.,"I like the way it works and does the job, but it is so floppy to use and you can't stand it up that it can be maddening. I end up not using it asoften."
2,Uprigt Stick Vaccum needs a larger bag,"It is a light weight vacuum which is nice. But, the bag fills up quickly and it must be changed several times during a simple cleanup of my living space. It is much easier to use a standard tank type or upright."
4,Effective but LOUD,"After reading loads of reviews on loads of vacuums, I settled for this one. I didn't want to spend too much as it seems none had that many great reviews. We can put men in space but can't figure out how to make a vacuum for hardwood floors. Overall it is effective and I am pleased with its performance. The cord gives it power that the cordless just doesn't have. The problems are that it has a shrill scream (yes I wear ear plugs when I have to do the whole house)and if you pivot too quickly it marks the floor. I will continue to wait for the perfect vacuum."
2,Not a good choice,"Vacuum picks up hair and dirt very well, but never operates for more than 3 minutes at a time before overheating. Takes many hours after overheating before being able to operate again. Unbelievably poor design. A waste of money."
1,Garbage!,"After a month of little use it sounded as if it had asthma. Hoover Hospital was as complicated as Obamacare. So after the second month of even less use, the patient died. Please, in lieu of flowers, do yourself a favor and resist the urge to buy a Hoover an American industrial giant that gave it's proud name to the act of sucking - ""hoovering"" and ""hoover"" this!"
1,Hmmmm,I'm a little wary of this review as I read the EXACT same review for a Dirt Devil vac here on Amazon. Makes me think NONE of the reviews are trustworthy. Thanks a lot.
2,Good until it broke,"I have berber carpet in my apartment so bought this vacuum clean it. I was happy with it, but In just over a year, after only using it once a month or so, it started making a really loud noise and then stopped working."
2,Did not last!,This vacuum worked great for about 6 months and then the motor started overheating periodically. It finally got to the point that the vacuum would only work in 10 minute increments. Now I am looking for a new vacuum!
5,Works great on hardwood floors!,This vacuum works great as intended. It isn't really designed for WW carpeting.However I do find it is quite good at getting Cat and Dog hair. It also works good on Small to Large area rugs.
1,Okay for small jobs.,"Seems to pick up dirt an lint well. Unfortunately, it overheats easily so it doesn't finish any typical household vacuuming. Maybe if we didn't have a short hair cat it would work better, but whatever the reason, I wish I could find a good light weight vacuum for tile, as this doesn't meet my needs."
5,It Really Sucks Up,We really think this is the way to go for people with hardwood or tile floors. Our cleaning lady loves it.BZCollins
4,I like it overall,"Pros:+ Very powerful. (I was shocked when it sucked up a quarter of my kitchen floor mat. Before this vacuum, i used to own a similar vacuum made by a different company, and that other vacuum could only pick up fluffy dust bunnies and light dirt). But this one gets the big chunks too.+ Flat shape of head allows it to reach underneath my furniture.Cons:- The head swivels, so it can be hard to control/maneuver the gadget to the spot that I want to go to. Maybe I'll get used to this with time. And maybe this is a Pro for others."
1,Disappointed with product packing,"I was really excited to purchase this vacuum for my daughter because I own it and really like the vacuum. However, after lugging the unopened box from So. Jersey to Brooklyn, I was dismayed to find the toggle bolt that holds the handle onto the vacuum was not included. We called the phone number on instruction sheet and recording said: for parts - go to website. Bummer, no computer. Now I had to repackage and bring back to So. Jersey. I hope I can get better service than my daughter who has no computer.UPDATE: Contacted Hoover via their site. I received an e-mail back confirming my request for the missing toggle bolt. That was on January 5, 2010 and today is February 04, 2010. We are still waiting and hoping this part is just on backorder. I am still using the original flair that I purchased several years ago and hope to receive the missing part for my daughter's Flair soon."
2,Constantly Overheats and Shuts Off,"I read reviews for a lot of different ""stick"" vacuum cleaners before buying this. I am really disappointed! First off, it's pretty loud - I thought there was something wrong with it at first. It's also heavier than I expected for a stick vacuum. I use it on hard surface floors and area rugs. It picks up great, and works well on hard flooring, but it's terrible for rugs. It picks up debris, but it can only clean about 1/2 of an 8x10 area rug before it starts to smell wierd, and then it shuts off (and yes, I do empty the collection cup regularly). I have to let it ""rest"" for at least an hour before it will work again. It should not be advertised to clean rugs if the motor cannot handle it."
1,bad purchase,"I purchased this vacuum in August and here 3 months later the vacuum no longer works. I thought it was great at first, light weight, perfect for light weight everyday cleaning. When I started the vacuum up the other day the motor turned on and the brushes even worked but it no longer sucked anything up. Very unhappy with this product!"
1,Broken in 5 months,"Bought this Hoover for hardwood floors. We only use it on three smaller rugs once or twice a week. 5 months later the brush no longer rotates. I checked the belt and it is present and tight. Switch or motor is shot. Hoover does not have anyone who does warranty repairs for several hundred miles. Return for service is on my dime, that sucks!"
1,Only after 5 months of use it died,"We have a Rainbow vacuum cleaner but it's a hassle to get it when only a small job needs to be done. This little Hoover S2220 works like a dream. We have dogs and I wanted to vacuum also during the week not only on week ends and this little guy gets the job done well. It's gentle enough on our cherry redwood parquet but when I turn on the carpet switch it's strong enough to get all the doggy fur off the area rug.Edit previous review: Finally I have time to edit my review. Unfortunately only after 3 months of use the suction got worse and worse by every use and another couple of months later it just died, finito. I did everything I was supposed to do, cleaned the cup very frequently, turned the vacuum cleaner off to let it cool when it overheated (usually after 5-7 mins of use). Will not buy the same again. Very disappointed."
2,"Hoover Flair is ok, just ok.","I bought the Hoover Flair bagless because I read all the 4 star reviews on Amazon. But the suction leaves something to be desired. It quickly becomes just a machine that moves dirt around. I'm disappointed in the power. But more importantly, no vacuum designer has yet designed a ""good"" mouth nozzle to get the corners & prevent things from getting stuck on the plastic edge of the nozzle."
4,"Great, light weight and easy to use","This one is almost as good as my other Hoover with a power nozzle! It's great on hardwood, tile, and throw rugs, but definitely misses the mark on carpets (my old one was MUCH better). I have pets - and it does fine with the hair. I do wish this one had an on/off switch on the power nozzle and hand tools for getting in the crevices. I like the swivel head - makes it really easy to get under just about anything. Overall, it's a great vacuum for the price - and since it's easy to use, I get it out more often than I did my big full-size vacuum!"
5,Great Little Vacuum,"I have bought vacuums three times the price of this one and this vacuum is unbelievable. If you have pets, it's great at picking up pet hair, kitty litter, etc. It doesn't scatter dirt - it sucks it right up. I really have nothing negative to say about this vacuum cleaner. I've read other reviews, stating that the top portion of the cleaner is too heavy to stand on it's own, so I just set it against a chair or sofa. No big deal. It's a great bang for your buck!"
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes when I ordered this vacuum. It had great reviews and I liked how compact it was since my storage closet is tiny. Very quickly, however, I came to be disappointed. The vacuum overheats and shuts off after only 5 minutes of vacuuming my carpets. After 15 minutes or so, I can turn it on and use it again, but it takes a long time to finish vacuuming my small apartment! It seems that the vacuum is best suited for hardwood floors since I don't have a problem with overheating when I vacuum on the wood floors. I am now searching for a new vacuum."
5,Hoover S2220 stick vacuum is great,"This is a great vacuum for light clean up, quickly and easily. I have used it on rugs and hard surface and it works well. It is light which makes it easy to pull out, use and put away quickly. It was recommended to me and I would recommend it as well."
2,OK,Great for light cleaning. But the weal broke the first time I used it. They sent me a replacement part. So I would say light duty cleaning.
5,"love it, love it, love it!!","Have used nothing but big,clunky Electrolux canister vacs for 43 years- what a terrific discovery to find something like this for quick clean-ups - don't know how I ever did without it! Love the CONVENIENCE,the light weight, swivel ability, see-thru ""bagless"" bag, hook to hang it up, the movable hook for easy release of the wrap-around cord, the carpet/floor option, even the red color. I use it mainly for the carpet in my large family room and it has never cut off on me. I clean the ""bag"" after each use. It thrills me each time I use it."
1,Used it twice,"Used this twice and then it simply stopped working - it simply would not turn on. I would have returned it, but it was outside the Amazon return period. Cannot recommend."
3,doesn't last forever,"I really liked this vacuum when I got it. But now after about three years, it no longer works well: it's loud; it gets over-heated, and it shuts itself off. According to the Hoover website, there is no service outlet I can take it to within 100 miles of where I live. It really hasn't gotten that much use. It should have held up better than this."
2,Unquestionably a Floor scratcher - not pleased!,"I purchased this last week thru Amazon. Upon first use I thought it would be a great way to pick up dirt on my hardwood floors. I used it for the second time today and there is no question that it scratches the floor. I am very upset about it. It will be fine to use on the rug in our livingroom for a quick touch up, but I wanted something that would work both on hardwood and carpet. You shouldn't buy this if you're looking for something to use on wood flooring. I'm so disgusted I believe I've purchased my last Hoover vac."
3,Great vacuum but poor durability,"We used this vac on tile, wood, area rugs, ans carpeted stairs for 1 year and 3 months. Then the head of the vac broke off without any cause. It simply fell off one day while vacuuming. Don't get me wrong the vac is tremendous. It sucked up all the dirt and hair in my house but durability is a concern. The dirt filter is messy so be prepared to get dusty and touch a ton of hair. I also used another vacs attachment to clean the filter once a week because it gets clogged and the wires that hold the filters shape broke. Once again a great vac on hard floors and limited carpets but poor durability."
5,Very Nice,"I've only used it 5 times or so, but its great on both hardwood floor and carpet.I'm lazy, and I don't enjoy vacuuming, but this product makes me want to at least think about it."
2,Hoover Stick Vacuum sticks.,"We ordered this stick vacuum to replace an old Hoover stick vacuum, but the S2220 Flair had so much drag when using it on vinyl or tile floors, that my wife could not comfortably use it."
2,Hoover Flair S2220,"Product overheats quickly; therefore, it can only be used for REALLY quick pickups..not very useful"
2,Not suitable for pet hair,"I bought this vac based on positive reviews here, but after several uses I have to say that the vac is pretty useless if you have any kind of pet hair to clean up. The ""bare floors"" setting is pathetic (just blows the dust around -- doesn't pick it up), so I had to use the ""carpet"" setting most of the time, and even that strongest setting leaves lots of hair and junk behind. What a disappointment! And this isn't the first modern vac that I've wasted money on. What is it with the vacuum manufacturers these days, anyway? Has technology actually gone BACKWARD in time?? My mom's vac from 40 years ago was soooo much more effective than this piece of junk! And by the way, this is NOT a ""freestanding"" vac -- you definitely have to firmly lean it against something to keep it from flopping over. I'm giving it 2 stars only because it's fairly attractive, but ... it's junk."
4,Hoover S2220 Flair,"Love this Vac...great suction, light weight, stores in a small space and is quick and easy to use. Love the brushless feature for my hardwood floors and rotating brush for my carpets, changing with a click of a button.I was thinking that I'll have to replace the filter fairly frequently because it tends to get clogged. I wanted to order extra filters through Amazon and they were on back order so I ordered from another company only to find out two weeks later that they are also having to back order the filters."
5,GREAT LITTLE VAC WITH SUPER SUCTION POWER,"BOUGHT THIS VAC IN OCTOBER OF 2008 AND FROM THE GETGO, IT HAS WORKED LIKE A CHARM. IT REMOVED SIX YEARS WORTH OF HUGE DARK GREY CLUMPS OF DUST BALLS AND LAYER AFTER LAYER OF ALLERGY CAUSING DUST AND DIRT AND DUSTMITES FROM UNDER MY KINGSIZE BED. YOU CAN POSITION THIS HANDY LITTLE UPRIGHT AND SLIM VAC IN ANY ANGLE YOU CAN IMAGINE AND GET RIGHT DOWN TO THE FLOOR WITH IT FOR THOSE UNDER-THE-BED AND HARD TO GET AREAS THAT OTHER, HIGHER PRICED VACS JUST WON'T LET YOU DO. AS LONG AS YOU REMEMBER TO EMPTY THE DIRT/DUST CUP INSIDE THE VAC EVERY SO OFTEN, ONCE OR TWICE PER MONTH IS WISE, (AND IT'S EASY TO DO), THEN THIS VAC WILL PERFORM FOR YOU THE WAY YOU EXPECT. GREAT DEAL FOR THE PRICE."
3,great until it broke,"I've owned this for 6 months. I had difficulty attaching the body to the head as it never seemed like it clicked into place and I couldn't push it in any more. A few weeks ago the head fell off and when I was pushing it back on, the neck piece broke. Now it can't be used at all.while it worked, it worked great, but they need to rethink the connection at the bottom"
5,Vacuum,"I couldn't be more impressed. I bought it for dog hair, crumbs on tile, and for a room with a wooden floor. It picks everything up, no problem. This is a really good product."
2,Started out great...then fizzled...,"I've had this vac for about a year. It started out wonderful, but in a few months it would run very hot and then just stop working. It has a hard time completing a room. I only have hardwood floors, so I'm not sure why it fizzles so easily. I would not recommend. I am buying a new vac that can handle an entire room."
4,"For its price, definitely worth it!","I've been using this vacuum (4-5 times a month) for about two years. For its size and price, it does its job very well (compared to some horrible Dirt Devil product I used and got angry over). It's powerful enough to suck in hair and little pieces of junk all over my room which is fairly small.I would NOT suggest this product to someone who needs to vacuum a big office space or house. I use this for my dorm-sized room and kitchen.A minor problem I have with this product is: after using it for 2-3 minutes, the machine starts making a loud, loud, loud sound (which started happening after a year or so). Although the noise doesn't really affect its efficiency, it can be quite annoying because it can be VERY loud, loud enough to annoy neighbors."
1,Disappointing,I bought the Hoover S2220 Bagless Upright Stick Vacuum with Power Nozzle because I was tired of having to drag my Dyson up and down stairs and wanted something that would hang neatly in the pantry for basic pick ups. It was fabulous. Initially. Within a few months it was constantly overheated and spent more time cooling off than picking up. I've long since replaced it with a Miele and that's still going strong.
2,disappointed,"I purchased the Hoover vacuum and was very happy at first. It picks up dirt remarkably; however, I returned the first one I ordered because the cord was not secure with the outlet. Each time I moved the cord it would stop working as it was not securely plugged into outlet.The second one I received worked great for about a week and then the switch broke. I could not vacuum in the hard wood mode.The vacuum also gets very hot."
1,Waste of money and resources,"Vacuum overheats and shuts off after a couple of minutes, takes 30-45 minutes to cool down before it will start again. I took it to the only nearby service center, about 15 miles away. I explained the problem and they actually said ""these are not designed to be used as vacuum cleaners."" WTF? They also said the warranty only covers defective parts and they would have to charge me to look at it and determine if any parts were defective. BS!Now all of the materials, energy, and human effort that went into manufacturing and shipping this defective product are a total waste. This useless product will just end up in a landfill."
2,"Fairly weak, prone to clogs and broke completely after a year","I have hardwood floors so I got this to keep a 9' x 6' rug free of cat hair. It did a rather mediocre job of this to begin with (which wasn't all that shocking at this price), has had a string of mechanical problems (clogs really easily, I must've disassembled the thing to entirely to clean it every month or two) and died completely yesterday after a year of very light use."
3,"Great vacuum, but doesn't last long.","This is now my SECOND hoover flair vacuum. The positive is that the vacuum works great on hardwood and pergo, and also on small throw rugs or large area rugs. I love how light it is, it doesn't exhaust me to vacuum the whole house because it's easy to push around.However, this is the second vacuum i've had to buy and now the second one has died. I'd say this vacuum has lasted me about a year each time and then it has a mysterious death.This time---it is losing suction and when i switch to the ""carpet mode"" it screeches HORRIBLY loud and won't suck up anything. In fact, it spits out clumps of things i sucked up a few minutes earlier.I take good care of the vacuum, and i change the filter regularly---but the rotating brush always gets clogged and caught up with hair and carpet fibers which i always have to cut out with scissors.I'm really dissapointed at the life of this vacuum, so i doubt i'll be buying a third."
2,This vac was a bust - lasted a month,"This vac was most promising. It had one switch for two features - brush up for floor and down for carpet. Both worked well for the time that it worked, and the head did a lot of swiveling, which made pick-up that much easier. The bagless feature was nice and it emptied easily. As an aside, I realized how much I missed a crevice attachment, for the tops of moldings et al.Alas, one month to the day, the floor switch ceased operation and it was brush down or nothing. Very disappointed - I won't get another but will probably upgrade to something better made - with a crevice tool."
2,lovely but won't stand up for long,"I loved this vacuum for about 2 months, and put up with it falling all over the place. However this became the major flaw with it - it should be able to stand upright but never did - to the extend that it would fall over and eventually it broke from the impact - I am very gentle with my posessions - however this vacuum, however gentle you were with it - ended up broken and the part that was broken couldn't be replaced. Only getting 2 months out of the vacuum (only using it once a week) doesn't seem like value for money or quality to me."
1,Stopped working in fewer than 30 days,"Like others I am disappointed with this purchase. It worked great and I loved it for the first three weeks, then out of the blue it stopped working. I was vacuuming some hardwood floors and the machine suddenly became kind of quiet. I turned it over and noticed that although the suction was still working, the roller was no longer turning. Without the roller it doesn't pick up much of anything. This may be caused by a problem with the belt or it may be something more serious. The owner's manual says that owners cannot change the belt so either way I would have to take it to a Hoover repair center. I can only imagine that costs more than I paid for it, plus the time and hassle involved makes it not worthwhile to me. I liked this vacuum, but it's not worth $60 for less than one month's use."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this stick 14 months ago to clean hardwood floors of a new townhouse. Guess what? It just stopped working (just out of it's 1-year warranty). The head brush no longer moves, and in looking at the Hoover manual that it came with, they don't give belt replacement info. The manual says to ""...take it to a Hoover Dealer for service"". What a joke-- I'd spend more on service than I spent on the vacuum. My advice-- spend the money and buy a more reliable vacuum. I loved the lightweight system originally, now I'm using the vacuum I've had-- a Panasonic upright for 17 year, and no service ( and I laughed at myself for buying a Panasonic vacuum... hmmm). It's not the greatest for hardwoods, but at least it works. What's happened to America that we manufacture things that break in a year?! I will NEVER buy another Hoover EVER-- Hoover should be ashamed to manufacture such an inferior product."
2,Not for Dogs and allergies,"The product worked well. The suction was powerful. The problem came when emptying dirt and cleaning the filter. My dog sheds, I would have to clean out this machine 3 times before finishing. To clean the machine you must pull the hair out by hand and then use a toothbrush on the filter bag. After that you may rinse the bag and replace when dry.It would have been perfect with removable bag."
3,Good but not great,Good on bare floors for picking up cat hairs and litter. Does reasonable job on carpeted floors and stairs. Power nozzel failed early on and repair requires bringing/sending vacuum to an authorized service center. Hoover will not allow owner to repair nor send repair parts to owner. Were it not for the power nozzel problem I would have rated the vacuum at 4 stars.
3,cant get it fixed,"I loved this vacuum from the sec it came out of the box. i have had it now for 6 months and the belt went on it. Not a big deal if i could find a place close enough to honor the 1 year warrenty. There is only 2 stores in our state that would do so but the gas to get there would cost more than buying a new vacuum. I tryed to buy the belt to do it myself but in calling the company the only way to get a new belt on is by taking the vacuum completly apart, which you need special tools to do that with. Also the vac could be impoved slightly by making the dirt cup bigger, in a small apartment I find myself emptying it once before I can finish the job. Emptying is also a concern in that its a very messy job and cleaning the roller each time is a must. I could live with all of that because it did do the job of cleaning well. I just cant get it fixed so its now become a headache. Is it worth $40 every 5 months .........?"
2,Better than a broom?,"I bought this to do daily quick cleaning around my toddler's high chair and in the kitchen, as a supplement to dragging out the miele canister (which I love but it isn't always so handy). I am returning it after one week because it is incredibly noisy, it doesn't pick up small bits of food, and the instructions say you are supposed to empty the canister and wash out the filter bag EVERY TIME YOU USE IT! How on earth is that easier or more convenient than a broom and dustpan?"
3,Hoover Flair Stick Vac,"I've had a few Hoover Flair Vacs and like them b/c they are light weight. For someone who vacuums daily it won't last very long. But for every couple or few days it'll do for a good amount of time. Has great sucking power and a long cord. It's perfect when you need to do a quick job and don't want to lug out a heavy vacuum. Has the beater brush for low carpets and does a good job. Good to do the stairs with too, again b/c it's light. It won't last forever but for the price, it lasts long enough."
4,Excellent till it lasted,"This stick vac lasted me only for 11 months but did an excellent job on laminate floors and area rugs. One swipe and the dust and small particles were gone.I should have been a little more careful when using it under the beds and sofa. The power nozzle would get stuck in the legs and I guess I was not gentle enough while using it. The part where the stick body attaches to the power nozzle broke. Sad...I could attach them using duck tape but will lose the swivel action.Have ordered the Hoover Linx cordless, hopefully that one last longer."
3,Only lasted 18 months,"Loved this little vac when I bought it from Amazon in July 2011. I only used it about once a week to spot clean the carpets and hardwoods. Today (Feb 7, 2013), when I started to use it on the carpet, it broke in half just above the power nozzle. I only paid $49.00 for it, so maybe it's asking too much for it to last more than 18 months, but since I didn't use it daily, it's a bit disappointing that it didn't last any longer than it did. Will have to think about whether or not to purchase another one like it."
4,vacuum,This vac was just what was needed for my hardwood floors. The brush roller can be shut off when doing Hardwoods.Powerfull suction. Dust bag needs cleaning after each use.
5,great vac,love this. if u don't feel like bringing out out the big guns...this is perfect for a quick touch up! i have a dog and 3 cats so i have plenty of hair flying around.......this is perfect......lightweight.....i use it daily!
1,Piece of garbage,"Had one and was very pleased with it. Power nozzle stopped working after six months and a ""handy"" person tried to repair it to no avail. I therefore negated warranty. So I ordered another...had to be returned because the power head was ridiculously noisy...exchanged for another, same problem. A call to Hoover and the rude service person implied that if I had gotten it from them I wouldn't have had the problem. Hoover has become a third rate product. So disappointing"
4,Great suction power,Works well on tile floor with really good suction.....maybe a bit too much suction on scatter rugs when filter is first cleaned. So far only negative was surprise at the weight of the machine when pushed since the motor is in the body....but have adjusted. Electric cord is placed a bit low from end of handle but it's a nice long cord so not really a problem.....prefer machine with electricity rather than battery operated so compromise on dealing with cord connection. So far......would buy again.
5,Excellent Vacuum for the kitchen and Tile,I was sick of the cordless vacuums making a lot of noise and picking up nothing. This corded vacuum works great! Has a lot of suction and works great. It is a little loud but does clean very well for its size. We also have a big kenmore canister vac for our main vacuum. This one we leave in the kitchen for quick pick ups.
5,WOW!!,"I have a German Shepherd who sheds enough hair to build her own dog every week. I had gotten used to having hair everywhere, all the time. Thought it was inescapable, until now! I got this vacuum and I can whip in out in seconds and have the downstairs ship shape in no time. It is powerful and lightweight, which I need. It's small enough to stick easily in a closet or corner without being in the way. The power cord wraps easily without any bending, which can cause me great pain. Emptying the cup is easy, too. I couldn't believe how much dirt it picked up!I've only had it a few days and will update if I run into any problems. But right now, I'm in love! LOL I DID buy an extra filter since it really fills up the holes with dirt. I want to be able to use it each day and rinse the filter. Having 2 allows a day for each filter to dry before putting it back in.So glad I got it! Awesome! Thanks, Hoover!"
4,The Flair Bagless Upright by Hoover works well,My first reaction after assembly is that this cleaner is too heavy. Yet after I used it I'm pretty well satisfied with my purchase. The swivel head works well and slips under furniture very well. While it doesn't have much suction its brush roller does a nice job sweeping dirt into the machine. Other reviewers have said it overheats but such has not been a problem for me.
5,powerful vac,Great vac. Has lots of suction. I wish I would have gotten it without the brush as I am using it on tile floors. The rugs I have used it on bogs it down a little. cleaning the little filter bag is a little messy but the dirt cup is no problem.
5,great stick vacuum,"This is a great stick vacuum. It picks up dog hair,dust, even cereal on bare wood floors. The suction is good and does not scratch the wood. It is also great on area rugs using the roller brush. It is very easy to operate and to empty the dirt cup. I do wish it would stand on it's own,but it is a small problem compared to all the good things about it."
2,arrived broken,"I don't know how this vacuum works because it was badly damaged when it arrived, the plastic was broken in several places. I'm returning it, but Amazon doesn't make it so easy, I have to pay the shipping. Hopefully Amazon will reimburse me. I'm really disappointed, not sure I'll order anything but books from Amazon in future, hardly seems worth the trouble."
1,"Broke within 5 Month: Not Durable, not strong enough","My wife and I decided to buy this vacuum after reading the reviews online. We only had this for 5 month and used less than 10 times...and it's not working anymore. We didn't drop it, we emptied the vacuum everytime...and this is what we get in 5 month, a broken vacuum. Maybe it was factory defect, maybe it was just our vacuum, but yea it was never strong enough to vacuum a tiny piece of paper on our carpet, which i was able to pick it up easily. I called the Manufacture and a machine informed me a nearby retail store. I called the retail store and wanted to make sure I don't have to pay anything for it, since I have 1-year warranty. But the repair person told me, it depends, Hoover only covers the motor. So yea, if you think what Amazon says about 1-Year ""Full"" warranty...do not rely on it. If you are looking for good durable vacuum, look for some other product. Definitely, not worth spending your money."
2,loved it when it was working,This product worked great on my hardwood floors for a little over a year. The motor eventually died. Honestly I have not had much luck with stick vacuums in general. I had 2 Electrolux prior to this one and the cordless feature (holding a charge)was a problem. That was why I chose the corded Hoover. Oh well.
3,Not so Great,"I bought this vacuum for quick clean-ups. I like to do a quick vacuum daily in the main entry room. The problem I find with this vacuum is that you have to replace the filters inside the canister OFTEN. This is a baglecss vacuum, but all of the dirt catches around the filter at the top of the canister. You have to open it and pull the dust and fuzz off of the filter or it won't have suction. These filters also have to be replaced often as they get clogged with dust really quick, and they are more expensive than a bag would be. So I dealt with the expensive filter issue because the vacuum works well and picks up good. But then the thing broke after 3 months. The handle broke off of the vacuum down at the bottom. It can't be fixed because the air and dirt travel through this area. I had to throw it in the trash. I won't buy this one again!"
4,Does exactly what I expected,"After reading the reviews on this model and countless others, I was very nervous to purchase any of them! Seems like everyone had at least some bad experiences. I've had this model for about a month now. I use it 2-3 times a week to vacuum our wood floors, the kitchen/entry and our area rug. The vacuum works excellently and picks up dirt, pet hair, leaves, etc. with no problems. I follow the manufacturer suggestion and empty and clean the cup/lint filter every time. The lint is kind of difficult to get off the lint filter; I use an old toothbrush. I prefer this to buying new bags all the time though. For the price and quality and I definitely recommend this vacuum.UPDATE - I've had it now about 4 months. I'm still happy and have no regrets. I do feel the suction has gone down a bit on carpet (I use it on our area rug), but it works well on the hard wood. The filter is a pain to clean and I've stopped doing it every time (I just don't have time)."
5,This floor vacuum is AWESOME!,"Love this neat little floor vac! Easy to assemble, very light, good length of cord. Swivel head works perfect and is good in then nook and cranny areas. Easily movable and cleans very well!We had 3 dogs at our house these past 2 weeks: a white lab (ours), english springer spaniel (my parents), and a bassett hound (my mother in law's) so you can only imagine the dog hair on my laminate wood floors! This vac made if effortless and only had to go over the hair one sweep!Highly recommended, won't be disapointed! Only tip is if you use this for dog hair, use an old toothbrush to clean out the dog hair from the filter."
5,Best little vacuum,Having arthritis in my hands it was a blessing that this vacuum was so light and works better than my expensive one.
5,"Powerful , efffiecient and long lasting machine",I have had many floor vacs-tried numerous brands. This particular Hoover is by far the VERY best. Had my first one for many years. Recently replaced mine and bought one for my daughter.
5,"Great for a little, cheap vacuum!","This vacuum works great for what it is. Its not for cleaning the whole house (its just too small), but for small areas it's excellent. I am always amazed at how much dirt and dust ends up in the dust bin after I'm done. Very satisfied, it does just what I wanted it to."
5,hoover flair stick vac,"I received this little vac. about a month ago. I just love it, small in size butit does a great job. I use it daily for a quick clean up. I have two cats andthis vacuum does a good job picking up pet hair..."
2,Handle broke after 2 years,We were very happy with this vacuum. It has good suction and is easy to wield around the house. However for some reason not linked to any abuse the handle snapped after about 2 years of occasional use. Your mileage may vary.
1,Horrible Design,Beware this bagless unit will not stand upright to save its life. Waste of money and time gets clogged constantly over heats and shuts off for hours at time. YOU will break this unit by simply trying to balance it to stand.
1,Don't waste your money,"This vacuum is a piece of junk. I purchased it for my RV and it is useless. No suction other than to pick up minute pieces of dust. I thought it would do the trick, but no luck. Don't waste your money."
3,Wonderful vacuum but doesn't last long,"Love this vacuum when it worked. But I had to bring it for repair after 11 months since there was no suction and it overheated, luckily it's still under warranty. Then it last for another 4 months, the stick got broken and I have to throw it away. I'm happy with its working performance but not happy about its durability."
4,A Little Disappointed,"I selected this product after reading many reviews from previous buyers of this product. Overall, I am happy with the vaccum. It is quiet, lightweight, turns well and really gets the dirt and dust up off the floor. However, it over heats if I use it to long without a break. But overall I would recommend this product to anyone."
1,what a disappointment,"I bought this for my daughter, who has lots of hardwood and one roomsize rug in her downstairs. She has a large family and needs convenient easy to use cleaning tools. I read the reviews and thought this would be perfect. The first time I used it at her house, it quit working on the hardwood setting. The carpet setting continued to work, but not the setting we really needed. Now, I have to deal with trying to find out how or if I can return this, or simply swallow the cost and try a different brand."
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"As repeated over and over in many other reviews this little vacuum is FANTASTIC! I recently had hardwood floors put in the entire main level of my home. I also have two basset hounds that constantly shed. My beautiful Brazilian Walnut floors were covered in white dog hair every time I turned around. I was desperate to find something that would pick up all the hair but not scratch the floor and this vacuum was it!It has two modes carpet and floor. The carpet-mode simply powers up the power head roller. It works fantastic on area rugs and kitchen mats. This little vacuum is VERY powerful and picks up TONS of dog hair. I also use this on the hardwood steps and it does an amazing job.The low-profile and swivel head allows you to get under everything including furniture with ease. It has a decent length cord and collection container, and it is slim enough to store just about anywhere.I HIGHLY recommend this vacuum. The price is right and it performs way above my expectations."
4,Does what it's supposed to do!,"Finally! This is what I've been looking for in a hardwood-floor vacuum. (Works great on my bathroom tile, too.) With a dog, a bird and a kid, I've got plenty of hair, dirt, sand, crumbs, seeds, etc., to clean up and this does the job. I used to have a Dirt Devil Broom Vac and was constantly frustrated with its lack of suction and battery life. I have only two minor complaints about this Hoover, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. The cord could be longer (just another 5-10 feet would be very helpful), and I've found that if you're not careful when standing it up straight it tips over, being a little top-heavy. But I love everything else about this and highly recommend it for hard floors. Works great on area rugs, too, with a minor flip of the switch. And who can beat this price?!!"
3,Worked great... for a year.,I loved this product until it reached its year anniversary. It doesn't work well anymore.
5,Great small vac,Lots of suction and pick-up power. A great small vac for smaller areas or quick touch-up.
4,Hoover vacuum,"This is a pretty nice little cleaner. It is lite and easy to maneuver. We had used one of these while on vacation. There was one in the condo for cleanup. It worked great there so I got one for my own use. It is great for quick little cleanups. The dirt retainer is a little small, but it is intended for small, quick cleanups. It is very nice for the small price and can be used for the whole house with frequent dumping of dirt. It has ample suction for its size.Very nice little cleaner for the price."
4,Great vac!,"I bought this for my mother after her central vac stopped working. She tells me that it works great on both tile and carpet, and it's so small and light that it's very convenient for whipping out for quick pickups. I chose it over a Bissell one that was less expensive because the Bissell didn't seem to work as well on carpets and now I'm glad I chose this one!She reports that she is having a bit of a problem with the head, however. On the carpet, it starts to fall off. Does she not have it assembled correctly, or is that a common problem with this vac?"
2,great little vac for a year,"I've had two of these vacs in two years. They are great for bare floors and throw rugs. Very maneuvarble and a snap to use. BUT they only last about a year. The first one I thought was maybe just the vac, but now the second one is the same. It overheats in about 10 minutes and shuts down. If you don't mind spending 50 bucks every year for a great little vac, then you'll be happy with the performance. Performance is a 4 star; longevity is a 1 star."
4,LOVE LOVE LOVE,I was looking for a small vaccum for my wood floors and this one just fits the bill. It has a lot a power for a small lightweight vac with additional power for my small carpets. I just love it. Vcook
4,Exceptional Product,"Excellent for those quick cleanups when I don't want to haul out the vacuum cleaner. Lots of power and a good filter, easy to empty the dirt cup. Easy to operate and light weight. Wish the switch from floor to carpet felt stronger, would then rate this 5 stars."
1,"Great first day, then barely useful","I bought this vacuum to use on wood floors and carpet. It was cheap, and the switch worked well initially, but after a month I needed to take it apart weekly (6 screws and many tabs) to put the belt back on. The filter is also very messy to clean and clogs up quick if you have pets. After several months, the carpet switch no longer works, so it can only be used for bare floors."
5,Life saver,"Living in the dorms this is an amazing vacuum. Its small and compact and has an amazing power for such a small machine. Its pretty cost effective especially when you split it with a roommate, and the product picks up everything from dry mud, to salt!!! The only downside is cleaning out the bag-less filter, its a very messy to empty the container and clean the filter, but its a small price seeing how you don't need a to buy bags. This is a great buy and I would recommend it for anyone with a room or two to clean up."
4,Satisfied!,"I was anticipating the arrival of this vacuum and am loving it. I got it about a month and a half ago and use it once or twice a week for a half hour. I have a decent sized 3 BR apartment with hardwood floors and 4 large sized rugs and this works wonderfully.Pros:I use it for dust bunnies and it even does a great job at getting kitty litter.Its swivel neck is great for maneuvering corners and under tables. It's lightweight and the cord is pretty long.You don't have to bend all crazy to wind the cord up.Con:It can stand upright but if you're not paying attention, it tends to tip over quite easily.It seems like it could overheat if on the ""carpet"" setting for too long but I don't leave it on long enough to find out what happens afterwards."
3,May overheat and quit,"THis works great on the dog hair. But if you are using it for an extended period, like more than a half hour without shutting it off, it will stop working. It needs to cool down totally and then it will start up again. I have only had this for 3 months and this is the first time it has happened, was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience with this product?"
5,"lightweight, maneuverable vac","I had bought this same vac for easy cleaning several years ago. Still works great.Not for heavy duty cleanup, but great for quick vacuuming on both hard surface and carpetwith its two stage setting and power brush.Just bought this one for my mother, who has arthritis and can't move the heavy vacuumaround. Working great for her."
2,Overheats too quickly (on carpet),"This is a decent, inexpensive vaccuum. However, I don't believe it can be used to clean carpets. We have a tiny living room and it overheats WAY too quickly when we flick the power nozzle on. We get maybe half of the living room vacuumed before it shuts down needing to be off for about 30 minutes."
4,Small but Powerful,"This vacuum is small, yet powerful. It gets under places, like the beds, that the bigger vacuums can't get to. It has two settings, one for floors and one for carpets. However, when using the carpet setting, you have to be careful not to get the electrical cord caught under the nozzle or it might chew up the cord a bit. It is lightweight and easy to maneuver. I've had several quick vacuums, and this one is by far the best I have ever had. My daughter needed a vacuum for college, and this is the one I bought for her. It is a great little vacuum. I would definitely recommend it."
5,Clean and Easy,This is the best little vaccuum cleaner you can buy. It's really powerful suction lifts up all kinds of stuff and the beater brush works great on both high and low pyle carpets. (Don't use it on shag or it will pull out all the threads.) The unit is very light and easy to manuver and the cup is easy to empty. We don't even use our large canister anymore. It's perfect for touchups or even a whole living room.
2,Shut down during 1st use and no longer functional,"Saw the good review and nice design. Bought one. During the 1st use, it shut down automatically after 5 minutes of use. Cannot restart again a few minutes or a few hours later. Disappointed about the poor quality."
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed with the product. It is very heavy and not easy to maneuver. Also, it lets off a lot of very hot air from the side vents. Don't want to go through the hassle of returning it, but cannot recommend it."
4,"Hoover Flair Bagless Upright Stick Vacuum with Power Nozzle, S2220","I love this product. I have been looking for something that can tackle all my animals fur balls on my tile floors and this vacuum works great. I has a rotating bristle brush which helps go from tile to my area rug. Easy assembly, light weight, canister easy to empty. Only two dislikes is the filter gets really dirty and the name of the product is deceiving. I assumed that there would be a hose and nozzle for getting into corners, but there isn't, just the rotating brush."
1,Runs for 5 minutes and quits.,"This is the most frustrating piece of equipment I have ever had. I keep the dust cup clean, remove the decorative plates on each side and yet it will run for just 5.5 minutes (we timed it) and stops due to over heating and won't start again for 30 - 45 minutes. Even a ""touch-up"" vacuum should last longer than that. Just a terrible machine. DO NOT BUY! Unless you only use it for 5 minutes at a time. It works well for 5 minutes."
3,little vac,"I bought this vac 1 yr back , it work good on hardwood floor but for my carpert it worked well intially then it started giving trouble as it stop wogrking on carpet button , it is good for little house for little work to get it done.. good for price .."
1,Died after about 25 uses,"Worked great when I first got it, and I liked not having to worry about bags getting discontinued since it is bagless.After about 25 uses, it felt like the power just turned to 50%. Turning it onto the hard floor setting now does nothing. Turning it on the carpet setting pulls stuff up but not into the chamber, just into the neck so it falls out as soon as you turn it off. You can do better for the money.Also, the main nozzle is impossible to get off if you want to change nozzles for different situations."
3,Vaccuming: good -- disposal of vaccumed contents: not so good,"Loud but efficient on wood, linoleum, tile floors; and only for use on rugs with a very short pile (forget wall-to-wall carpets). The exhaust is located on both sides near the top, and this design helps in vacuuming dust bunnies and pet fur without blowing it all around. Disposing of the dirt container is a mess, though, and this is where the Flair disappoints: dust will flow out and up as you dump the contents, and gets worse when you clean-out the filter (which should be done after each use or else the motor might overheat and break down). If you have easy access to an outdoor trash bin, then you're in luck; but you cannot empty the container indoors - forget it: prepare to go outside your door, cover your nose and mouth, and dump the contents into a trash bag."
1,doesn't last long,"I bought this vacuum back in march. it has stopped working already. the last few times i've used it, it has stopped for no reason. i let it be for a little bit then it will start again. finally today the bottom part of the vacuum just snapped off. it can't be fixed so now i have to go and buy another vacuum. when it worked yes it was great, picked up everything. very dissapointed that it's broken already. don't waste your money on this product. it won't last very long."
3,It broke as well,"I bought this item October of 2006 and it has already broke. Only got 7 months out of this vaccuum. Granted the little bugger put on quite a performance before it died, but I am a little disappointed because I expected better from Hoover. It still works somewhat, but the power nozzle no longer spins the brush, and with all the dog hair on my floors it's a necessity so it can actually get sucked up. I'm debating now on whether to have the vaccuum repaired since it did do well for awhile (lost suction but I guess that's expected) or try a different one. I'll probably go with a different style but still same brand."
5,wonderful wonder broom,The little Hoover Flair with the power head is small but mighty!This is the second one I have bought since Hoover change their stick vac to the Flair.I simply wore my first Flair out from daily use! We have 3 cats and 2 inside dogs...which constitutes a GREAT deal of sweeping.You will be very impressed with what this small but mighty vac can pick up!An added plus..you certainly can not beat the price of the Flair here at Amazon.Thanks A!!! :)
4,Excellent Product,This is a great stick vacuum. We loved is so much we purchased a second one for our vacation home.
4,Amazing,This vacuum eats dog hair and dirt. I have 10 dogs and 4 kids. I gave up on carpet and installed laminate floors. The flair will suck dog hair from 4 inches away. It picks up small rocks if you turn on the brush for a second. It cleans my rugs easily.The only cons are it is messy to enpty and doesn't hold enough dirt. It does have a cut out switch if you don't empty the dirt cup soon enough. If I skip a day of vacuuming I have to empty it multiple times. It also tips over easily.I am showing mine to my mom so she can see how handy this little vacuum is.
5,Great vacuum,"This vacuum is great and powerful....I use it every other day and I am amazed at how well it picks up dirt and cat hair....I tend to use it more than my larger vacuum.....easy to handle, empty and store....I would definitely purchase another."
2,Won't run for more that 5 minutes before needing to cool down,I bought this vac based on good reviews on this site. After giving up on battery operated vacs which lose power or wont hold a charge I decided to go with this corded vac for our tile floors.The suction is just 'ok' but the worst thing about it is that after running for less than a few minutes it will overheat and cut off. It won't turn back on until it has cooled down - usually after 10 minutes or so. Very annoying. I only use the bare floor setting and never use it on carpet.
3,product fail. suction fail after about 5 month of using it,"Order on oct/2010. When I first got it it was great. Sucking power, everything.One day. it just crap out and would not turn on. Everything was clean. Next day try again and it was back toworking.. After another month of using it. Finally crap out around march and that was the endGreat when it work... but too late can't return it.. Blah! waste of 50 bucks. shoulda just bought a diff one from Walmart for 100 bucks"
1,Dead as a door nail after only 6 months,"It worked fabulous for six months and died on the vine abruptly without warning. This after tender loving care - changed the dirt cup every time, changed the filters several times, only used on beautiful hard wood floors and small jute rugs. Here's the rub, you can't return it and get a new one even with that nice year warranty. Take to the service center, oh, I'm sorry, the nearest one is 58 miles away? How unfortunate! My advice? Get something that will last or that you can ship free for repairs. This is NOT it.Hoover Flair Bagless Upright Stick Vacuum with Power Nozzle, S2220"
3,"Works good, doesn't last.","Works very good, but doesn't last. After about 6 months to a year it will overheat and shutoff after only 10 minutes of use. I have owned three of them and all have done the same thing. Recommended if you don't mind shelling out 50 bucks every year or so for a new one."
1,Don't buy it,"was impressed at first cause it seemed powerful.""Died"" after a couple of months of light usage.leaves red marks on walls.Heats up quickly.spend more on something better."
5,Excellent stick vac.,"This stick vacuum has almost as much power as my wind tunnel.Lightweight.Long cord.Stands alone for storage.Does very well on carpet, and hard floors.Dirt cup size is what you would expect for a stick vacuum."
3,Great while it lasted,"it was light and functional. you can leave it under the bed or hide anywhere. It did the job well, I had hard floor and carpet. But it only lasted 6 months."
5,Ideal for small jobs,"This lightweight vacuum is ideal for hardwood floors and small area rugs. I especially love the fact that it easily slides under tables and furniture. My hardwoods get so dusty under our furniture and it's such a pain to move the furniture to vacuum. Now I don't have to because this thin vacuum will go right under my furniture. It doesn't work well on large areas of carpet because the rollers get cloged, but for everything else it is perfect. Also wish the cord was a bit longer. The pros certainly outway the cons and without hesitation, I strongly recommend this product."
5,My wife loves this quick broom,My wife says it is way quieter than others she has owned. She loves it !
5,"Hoover Vacuum, # S2220","Excellent Product., easy to purchase thru Amazon., EXTREMELY fast delivery.,Price was $20.00 cheaper than ordering thru Hoover direct...Will buy thru Amazon again when the need arises...."
3,Not as efficient as expected,"This vacuum works well picking up dirt and pet hair. It's lightweight, and moves easily. My only problem is that I can only vacuum one small room before I have to empty out the dirt cup and shake out the filter. And that's a messy job! I was looking for something that would be really easy to use, and this isn't working out that way for me. With pets, I end up having to sweep the room first, and then vacuum to make sure that all of the dust and hair gets picked up. Otherwise, I'd be emptying the cup every few minutes. If you don't have pets, maybe it would be more efficient."
4,Picks up well. Need to empty messy compartment occasionally.,Picks up as well as my larger vac. Need to be consistent about emptying the debris from the container. It is a messy process - not ogod for the allergy-prone. If you don't empty it the vac will temporarily stop working. You will have to empty the compartment and leave the vac running for a few minutes. Eventually it will work again.
1,broke within 2 months and 1 use,"This product is a piece of crap. Within 2 months and one use of the unit, the base suction unit broke off from the broom/stick part of the vacuum. If you look at it, it's only a tiny piece of black plastic that holds these two very important parts together. I tried to push it back together, but the plastic just completely broke. I tried to get warranty service since it was within the one-year warranty period, and the rather unhelpful person on the phone said that ""that part"" wasn't under warranty. ?? How worthless.So I wasted $50 on being able to vacuum an area rug once. Great, I could have used my dust buster for that."
3,OK with fatal flaws.,Have been using this for three years and it does an adequate job cleaning the floors. The fatal flaws are: 1. Our beautiful dark wood floors are covered with scratches that I did not notice at first that with testing were found to be the fault of the hard bottom of the vacuum. 2. With the collector only half full the motor overheats and stops. Takes about a half hour to cool and reset. 3. It makes a very loud high pitched noise compared to our much heavier upright unit. I would say the scratching is the real deal killer.
1,Lasted about Three Months,"I bought this vacuum in November. At first it seemed to work really well, then yesterday, suddenly, the sound of the motor became quieter, and it no longer would suck up anything!I thought I must have been too rough on it, then I read here that others have had a similar problem!The machine had gotten very hot to the touch, although I had only used it for 3 or 4 minutes.Very disappointing! I won't buy this again.I'm surprised-I thought Hoover was a good brand."
2,Broke two months after warranty expired,Great quick vacuum. Great suction. Don't recommend for everyday use. Broke where the stick attaches to the foot. Made in China
2,Worked great... for two years!,"I really liked this for the first two years. Great suction, gets into tight areas, swivel head works well for rapidly turning corners. After use of about once per week, this stick vac has died. Overheated and shut down... permanently. I'm guessing the motor burned out. It's a shame because we really did like how well it cleaned our tile floors."
1,Save your money - it's awful,"I never review anything, but felt compelled. It's terrible - like many others, mine no longer spins to pick up dirt, and the suction's terrible. Just buy something better."
4,Excellent little sucker!,"This is a great little vacuum! I needed something easy to get out everyday to pick up after 2 young kids, a cat & a dog- it picks up just about everything I need it too, including the pet hair & cheerios! It is very versatile, I use on hard wood, carpet in bedrooms, area rugs & even tile floors! The head is great to reach under & around furniture. So glad I found this so I don't have to drag out the big vac, broom & dust pan all around the house. I also really appreciate the bagless aspect, it is pretty easy to dump without throwing dust all around. The only draw back is the cord does seem a little short, but I suppose I can get an extension cord. It still beats the cordless vacs that you must have to keep charged- never worked for me."
3,Has Potential,"Haven't had it long enough to determine over-all rating. Initially seems to do quite well. I find it to be heavy, but being disabled is part of my limitations in using the product. Actually need to use it several months in order to make an adequate review as many products work well initially.Does seem to have a lot of suction power. Does pick up animal hair quite well. Problem is going under furniture. Have to tip it quite low to the floor to get under coffee tables and similar objects, and this affects suction. When doing this is when the weight seems the most noticeable."
1,Crapped Out,"I have owned the vacuum cleaner for about 2 years or less. I originally gave this a 4 or 5 star rating. I have used it only for light cleaning. I used it very little because I have a heavy duty vacuum. When I say heavy duty I mean ""heavy"". So whenever I didn't feel like dragging out the heavy vacuum, I used the lightweight Hoover. It worked very well all along. Yesterday I went to use it and it crapped out. I found that the brush didn't rotate anymore. No matter how I tried it I couldn't get it to rotate. What a disappointment. It is now going into the garbage. From now on I am staying away from Hoover products."
2,hoover flair bagless makes house dirty,"Hoover S220 flair bagless upright stick vacuum, this actually makes my floor dirtier, after using this, I have used this about 3 times to give it a fair shot, and cleaned filter after each use thoroughly, I am extremely unhappy, I have had a hoover quik broom which I have had for at least 25 years which uses G bags and i't still far superior to this. I would have returned it but I couldn't get it apart to put in box, my son also tried and gave up so I'm stuck with a piece of junk. Save your money and don't buy this."
2,breaks too easily,"I bought this 5 months ago. It falls very easily when standing against the wall. It overheats and shuts off quickly. I have a very small home and have to stop alot while cleaning. Now the vacuum broke at the swivel point. It is a piece of junk if you ask me! It seemed good at first. If I had known it would not last a year, I would have returned it!"
1,New Hoover Flair switch breaks,"I just used a brand new Hoover Flair (bagless) stick vac for the first time. The ""bare floor"" part of the switch has already broken after one use. This controls the suction of the motor. The ""carpet"" part of the switch does still operate and turns-on the roller brush in the power head. After cleaning both the filter and dirt cup, I let the vac cool down for an hour .... motor still will not operate with the ""bare floor"" switch. Total junk --- do not waste your money."
2,lasted only a few months,bought the vacuum in january and it stopped working in about 7 months. i wouldn't waste my money on this product. is there a warranty on this product?
2,Doesn't Last,"I ignored all the negative reviews that stated the vacuum overheated and stopped working. I shouldn't have. After about a year, I can barely get 1 room done before it overheats. I have to then leave it off for a good hour before attempting another room. When it's running, it works great. But there is no way it should overheat like that so quickly."
3,it is not cordless,"I searched a cordless hoover; but when we open the box, it is NOT cordless! Apart from that, the hoover works very well."
1,Piece of Junk!,The first time I plugged this thing into the wall a big plume of white smoke emanated from it and it almost caught on fire. So buy one at your own risk.
4,"Overall, a good buy","I bought this vacuum while I was shopping for an upright, but needed something to do quick cleans of the kitchen and entry way instead of sweeping every day- and this vac is good for that. Don't buy it as a primary vacuum unless you have a really small place and it's not carpeted, but for everyday quick once overs to keep the floors picked up it works great- easy to use, pretty quiet and manuvers well. It's great to do the small hallway/entry way-type throw rugs and is good to keep pet hair from accumulating in all those common areas where it seems to multiply overnight. Also nice to run by the litter box and catch all the stray litter before it spreads all over the house. I have only had this for a couple months, but so far I am pleased with it- well worth the 55 bucks."
5,Awesome vacuum!,"I searched a long time for an excellent, sturdy upright stick vacuum that wouldn't scratch my hardwood floors and that was easy to use for quick pick-ups. It does a fantastic job on both my carpets, stairs and floors, though I wouldn't use it for an all over house cleaning due to it's size."
1,Save your money,"Consistent with a lot of other comments, this item lasted a little over a year. The beater brush started slipping and making a horrible noise. I opened it and discovered the belt was loose. After much searching, I found a replacement belt and installed it. The beater runs fine, but it still makes a terrible noise. Now it has begun losing suction. I washed the filter and it still doesn't work as well as it did when I bought it. It's good for a quick pick up, but don't expect to run it more than a few minutes at a time. I have also had trouble with it overheating and cutting off. Overall, a very disappointing product. I'm shopping for a new one now."
2,It could be worse... but it could be a LOT better,"To me a vacuum is a pretty simple proposition; you want it to clean the carpet and the floor. Unfortunately, this unit is mediocre at best. I just finished cleaning my home office (hardwood floors with an area rug). I could literally see the vacuum missing small little pieces of debris - even after going over the area two or three times.It's a shame, but for the money - go elsewhere!"
1,DONT BUY-Worked well first few times but died thereafter!!,"So I purchased the Flair Bagless Stick Vacuum with Powered Nozzle after reading the reviews on Amazon. I live in a 2Br condo and didn't need a super heavy vacuum for my place. The reviews looked impressive and so did the price, so I went ahead and bought this. The first few times were great- it is light weight, picks up pet hair, easy to maneuver. However, lately (only using it for 5-6 times), it has started turning off on its own. If you leave it on for a minute- it over heats and turns off. You need to wait for another 20 minutes before it runs again. I have tried emptying the dust cup etc but that doesn't solve the problem. Its a big waste of money!! Whats the point of light slick vacuum which doesn't work?! I would say it doesn't even do light pick up cleaning, its just badly designed and I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it. Spend an extra $20 and get a better sturdy machine. This one sucks!"
1,lousy hoover electricv broom,worked fine on mostly hardwood and light carpeting for 6 months--cup emptied on regular basis--crapped out on month 6-- what a piece of dung
5,LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!,This little vac really works well. Excellent suction. Does not scratch hardwood floors. Gets up dirt at the edge of the floor and under toe spaces. Can get into small spaces and easily goes under furniture like kitchen chairs. Love the swivel head and low profile. Very easily switches to carpet or rugs at the flip of the switch which is very conveniently located just below the handle. Light enough to easily bring up and down stairs to use on other levels of the house. I have never had a stick vac that worked this well. I also like the bagless feature. The dirt cup was easy to empty. Highly recommend this product.
1,"Was great at first, but...","I, too, loved this vacuum. It worked well on my hardwood floors and area rugs. But just a few months after purchasing it, the belt broke, and I had to special order a belt since those types of issues are not covered under Hoover's warranty. Last week it broke again and I replaced at again. Then, once again, it broke again today. I am done with this vacuum!"
2,Cheap Parts,I purchased this vacuum after reading the positive reviews so that I could vacuum up pet hair off my hardwood floors instead of swiffering them. The first time I received it the hook that holds the cord fell off. I returned it for a replacement and the new vacuum fell over while it was standing and the clip that holds the canister broke. I now wish I had spent more money and gone with a vacuum that holds up better and isn't completely made of plastic.Cons:- Vacuum does not stand up on its own very well.- Short Cord- Parts are plastic so if they break they do not sell replacement parts you have to get a new one.
3,Great When It Works,"When it works, the Flair performs fine but it overheats & turns off after about 5-10 minutes of use, negating the convenience of a light weight vacuum. Vacuuming my hardwood floor becomes a drawn out affair because of this."
4,Dog hair-b-gone!,"I bought this vacuum initially just to pick up all of the hair that our two dogs leave behind every day on the linolium floors,(kitchen and laundry),as an alternative to lugging out my big vacuum every day. And anyone with dogs know that a broom and dustpan is not the way to go.Great suction,very powerful for a stick vacuum,the swivel head gets around the table and chairs with ease and it's simple to empty the tray. I love this vacuum! I use it everyday and have just started using it on the carpets too! I was actually surprised at how well it performed on carpeting. I only break out my big vacuum once a week now...and my back thanks me for that! I do wish that it had a longer power cord though,but I highly recommend this vacuum."
2,Wouldn't buy this one again,"This stick vac had many positive reviews, but it hasn't been great for me. It's fine for hardwood, but it does very poorly on my rugs. Even after going over certain areas repeatedly, there are many things it never picks up. I also have to regularly turn it upside down and pull out clumps of dust, fibers, etc. that clog that ""mouth"" of the vacuum. And when I flip the switch from ""bare floors"" to ""carpet,"" it spits out clumps of dust, hair, etc. onto the rugs that I have to pick up by hand. I realize stick vacuums aren't for heavy-duty cleaning, and this is the only one I've owned, so perhaps this is on par with your typical stick vacuum. And maybe the types of rugs I have just aren't a good fit for this vacuum, but I wouldn't purchase it again or recommend it to anyone else. I'm looking to replace it with something that can do floors and rugs equally well."
2,not a good vacuum,"I bought this vacuum in July, 2008. I wanted something light weight, bagless and works on both hardwood floor and carpet. I have hardwood floor for the whole house with area rugs in every room. I noticed the vacuum would be overheat and stopped working after 10 minutes of carpet vacuuming. It lasted longer with hardwood floor. I think it's the power nozzle for carpet cleaning that is easily over heated. I don't mind the engine shuts off by itself because I don't want the vacuum burned. Anyway, it's broken couple days ago by the neck between the suction head and the dust container. I am very disappointed and will not recommend it to anyone. I am buying a Bissell 82H1 which cost a bit more. I hope it will last longer."
5,Hoover S2220 Flair Bagless Upright Stick Vacuum with Power Nozzle,"Up to now I have always purchased cordless floor vacs. When I could not find replaceable batteries for the ones I purchased I decided to buy this. It is powerful, portable ,has a very long cord, easy to clean and does the an excellent job. I purchased this based on a Consumer Report review and they were proofed correct."
5,Great for pet owners with hardwoods and small rugs,Love it!! We wanted something easy to grab for our daily vacuums necessary to keep up with one large German Shepherd and 2 Papillons!Picks up everything on hardwoods and does a good job on runners or small carpets as well. It's everything they said it would be and at a good price.
5,Fantastic Little Vacuum,"I have 5 dogs and 1 cat and cant stand a house that smells like animal so I am constantly cleaning, sweeping, etc. Animal hair is my greatest problem, even after sweeping 2 to 3 times a day, followed by my electric swiffer (another great product), there is still hair to contend with. Wow!!! After using this vacuum for the first time I am hooked! We have mostly hardwood/tile/linoleum floors and this vacuum is so light weight and easy to use it takes less than 20 minutes to do the whole house. After using it I looked for hair and couldnt find any. I even use it in the only carpeted room in the house as the animals leave a trail from the door to the kitchen. I would recommend this vacuum to anyone with animals, not enough time to sweep, or someone with medical problems (as I have fibromyalgia). Very lightweight and easy to use!"
1,"Starts strong, but overheats quickly!","This vacuum is very easy to use and maneuvers well around furniture, etc. However, it's run time seems to be about 10 minutes and then it quickly overheats. Once it's overheated, it's quite a while before it cools down enough to finish a job. I used this vacuum in my RV on one camping trip and I couldn't vacuum even half the RV without it overheating. On the plus side, it did a nice job picking up the dog hair and debris ... until it overheated. Unfortunately, by the time we discovered this vacuum's shortcomings, it was past the return window. The downside of shopping online."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this vacuum less than 2 years ago. I only used it occasionally on hardwoods and for area rugs. It worked good for awhile, but then a few days ago the mode button only would work on Carpet mode and then the suction is barely noticeable. The main reason I have this vacuum is for the hardwoods and I can't even get it to work on that mode anymore!So not worth it to only have less than 2 years! I am on the hunt for a new one that won't die so quickly!!"
4,Very good vacuum,"I bought this vacuum over a year ago for my apartment. It serves it's purpose very well, cleaning both my carpets and wood floors without trouble. Is this the end all be all of vacuums? no, but it is great for my small home, performs well on all surfaces. I am so pleased that I recently bought one for my brother."
2,heavy little vacuum,"This vacuum is much heavier than my regular vacuum, an Oreck. I bought it to clean bare floors, thinking it would have more suction than cordless vacuums. Well, it certainly does and picks up on bare floors well, but hit a throw rug and it has too much suction to vacuum it. Since I have lots of floor mats on bare floors, by the sink, the doors, etc., I can't use it. Bad purchase for my needs."
2,"Good, while it lasted...","I purchased the Hoover Flair Bagless Upright stick vacuum through Amazon.com five months ago, primarily to use on my stone floors and small occasional rugs. It worked quite well for the first few uses. I estimate that I have used it perhaps 10 to 12 times, as I use it only in my weekend/vacation house. Now 5 months later it suddenly stopped working on the ""floor"" setting. The ""carpet"" mode still functions, but I don't know for how long. I think the vacuum should work for longer than a dozen uses! I am disgusted with it, and advise people to save your money. Get a different brand or a more expensive model."
3,worth buying,"I am very happy with the vacuum the only problem i have had is when i opened the container that fills up with dirt to clean it a piece broke off but i can still open it, it works fine for hard wood floors not so great on carpets."
2,not good after some months,in the starting this was good but after some months of use the hairs & threads got stuck and there is not way of cleaning the rollers .stopped picking up the dirt in some months . waste of money for me
5,Great Stick Vacuum,Best electric broom I've ever owned. It has great suction and is capable of cleaning floors and carpets with just a push of a button. It's easy to empty and clean. I highly recommend this product.
2,If only it could last,"This was the second time buying this little vacuum. The first one broke off right at the neck when I was not home. I just thought someone may have mishandled it so I bought another one. Too bad same thing happened to the second one after 7 months of usage. I now believe its a product defect. It is such a wonderful little vacuum when using it. great on both hardwood and area rug. I love that I only use one item for clean ups. I have 2 toddlers and that guarantees the house is messy almost all the time. With this little vac, I was able to do quick clean ups. Its got great suction. After a month of so of using a dust mop and my big vacuum am back on Amazon shopping for another one. Hope the next one lasts."
2,Piece of junk...,"I seriously wanted to love this compact vacuum, but it kept breaking on us! It snags up hairs that are really difficult to remove. Do yourself a favor and just invest in a good quality vacuum, even if its bulkier and more expensive."
4,Hoover is Heavier,"I think that this Stick vacuum has good suction, but I was surprised at how heavy it is. I was used to my old stick vacuum which was lighter. Guess I just have to get used to it."
1,Stopped working after 7-10 months of use,"We *were* very happy about the product, and we purchased 3 of these for different houses our extended family members have.They *all* stopped working (vacuum motor stopped working) about 7-10 months after we purchased them.Customer service is awful, giving us ""runaround"" for each of the 3 products we purchased."
2,this does not suck literaly,I have a slate Kitchen floor and needed a little vacuum to get the crumbs up in the morning after the kids go to school. This vacuum do not only NOT get up the crumbs it over heats in like 3 min. I can't even vacuum my whole floor. Unless you live in a tiny tiny tiny apartment and only need to vacuum 2 square feet then this vacuum is not the one for you!
5,I love it,This is a great vacuum for small everyday use. I use it to vacuum my kitchen floor and it has a very powerful suction. I would strongly recommend this product.
4,Padraigin,"Wow, was I surprised at the suction this small vacuum delivered. I don't like where the switches are, however. I guess I'll get used to them. I was looking to replace an inexpensive Vornado electric broom and this is a close as I'll get, I know. I have two cats that require a daily clean up in my bathroom where the litler box is and in my bedroom where they exit the bathroom. I keep it plugged in at the ready.So far, so good."
3,Hoover Flair - Bagless - Nothing Special,"Bought to replace a Dirt Devil that was just worn out. Easy to asemble. Seems to overheat after 2-3 minutes. No burning smell or anything, but the chassis around the motor gets extremely hot and I am afaid to continue.When standing up-right for storage, very tricky. Can fall over very easily. Cord length makes it impossible to wrap it around the holders and come out even. There is always 2 feet hanging out - just not the right length.Can't use the carpet speed on throw rugs - it eats them up. However, the hard surface doesn't work good on throw rugs either.Altogether, would not ever purchase again. Would go back to a Dirt Devil."
4,Happy with the Hoover,"Purchased the hoover Flair Bagless Upright in January. We have a small winter home with tile floors in all rooms except the bedrooms. The Hoover does a very good job on the tile and carpeting. It is not noisy, the cord is an adaquate length; you do have to make sure the filter is kept clean for optimum service. For the money, a very good buy."
5,Formidable book about cities and race relationships,"Don't be fooled by the first part of the title; for this book is really about Blacks, Jews, and the Changing Face of the Ghetto. Pritchett studies Brownsville in details, but never forgets to see the bigger picture, which should be of interest for any historian or social scientist. Pritchett is very good at giving you the facts, the analysis and the feelings as well. This book is not just about a ghetto in Brooklyn, it is indeed about urban change and inequality."
4,Coming home and coming together again,"Dalton's first novel ""High Strung"" drew me in immediately, and held me there! It's a book of a difficult homecoming and reconnecting with a past and a present that don't completely mesh. I really loved how all of the characters were dealing with each other at the dangerous edges of their lives; that place where people are afraid of showing too much but needing to, desperately. The characters choose to come together after a long hiatus with a mixture of unease, humor and understanding. A great book!"
5,High Strung: Character-driven Fiction at Its Best,"No loose-ends are left undone in this novel about a thirty-something returning home to find closure regarding her past. Dalton masterfully weaves the Vietnam era to the present while presenting parents many of us know very well: flawed, ill-fated, but loving, nonetheless, in their own quirky ways. With characters not unlike those from a McMurtry novel, the reader will find him or herself laughing and crying with their struggles, compelled to turn each pleasurable page, to follow them to the book's end."
2,"Great cable, poor value.","This is a great cable, very well built and all that. However, for digital media, either the signal goes or it doesn't. The price of this cable makes it a very poor value, when a $1-$10 cable will transmit the same signal with the same quality as this one. Unless you're doing a lot of shifting and plugging/unplugging, or in a harsh environment, the price of this cable just isn't justified."
4,Poignant and Memorable,"With all the contemporary emphasis on gay disco lives, it's wonderful to find a book that is simply about life and everything in it. This book is truly about family. It is about the struggles so many of us must face every day, far beyond the days when coming out seemed our biggest drama. As Max's mother withers away from cancer, a very human portrait emerges of a very usual American family."
5,Meilleur groupe de rap francias,"Cette album est un vrai bijoux. Tout au long de l'album les 3 rappeurs aketo, tunisiano, black renega s'en prenne au FN et au racisme en générale. Les meilleurs chanson de l'album sont Du RIRE AU LARME, PRIS POUR CIBLE , QUAND ON TE DIT , FAUT DE TOUT POUR FAIRE UN MONDE et ON S'EN SORT BIEN."
5,Best French Hip-Hop out there!!!!,"I cannot speak French, I am caucasian and live in Australia. I must be the very last person Sniper would expect to listen to their awesome tracks discussing Parisian ghettos, La Pen's facism and the general state of our prejudiced world.La France is one of my favourite hip-hop songs of all time, perhaps only surpassed by the AMAZING track Visions Chaotiques from Sniper's debut album. The title track is also awesome and has a very catchy hook, awesome flow and of course a powerful beat.Sniper are a very special force in hip-hop and should be enjoyed by rap fans worldwide."
2,[Weak]!,"I love war type games, and when my brother bought this, I thought it was going to be great. I guess I was expecting a bit much, maybe a lot much. The game's graphics are putrid. awful sounds, and [weak] gameplay. No good plots either. Enemies have the strangest ability of shooting through trees and small hills at you, but you can't shoot them. It took two days to finish it. It was the worst I have played.The upside - . . .Wait, what upside?The downside - About everything. If you are thinking of buying the game, do yourself a favor and rent it first. You might just kick yourself about it later."
1,"This game sucks, period end of statement.","This is one of the worst five games for Playstation of alltime! Do not buy it! I bought it and ended up bringing it back,telling them it was so terrible, and they new what I was talking about! If you are considering buying this game, DON'T! Even though it is cheap, it is still not worth it! Go buy something a little more fun, like colored rocks."
4,"Difficult, but entertaining","I found this game earlier than it was supposed to be released, but it's a fun game if you are into military/action style gaming. For it's price, you can't lose. I thought that it wouldn't be a very good game, but I underestimated it. Great quality for it's price. I only have one complaint, it's very difficult and frustrating. So if you want a fun game that won't empty your wallet, this is it."
5,"NOT YOUR AVERAGE GAME BY A LONG SHOT, PURE FUN.","I AM A HUGE FAN OF CLANDESTINE OP TYPE GAMES (METAL GEAR SOLID, SYPHON FILTER 1&2, CHASE THE EXPRESS [OR COVERT OPS: NUCLEAR DAWN IN THE STATES]ALSO A GOOD BUY) AND THIS ONE MADE ME DOUBTFUL ESPECIALLY DUE TO THE LOW PRICE. I WAS THINKING THAT THIS WAS ANOTHER RAINBOW SIX CLONE,YOU KNOW GOOD ON PAPER BUT BUT TERRIBLE ON THE PLAYSTATION. BUT, WHEN YOU SWITCH TO THE 3RD PERSON MODE AND START TO SCOUT THE TERRAIN WITH NVG'S AND SWITCH 1ST PERSON VIEW TO SNIPE ENEMIES WITH THE SILENCED MP5, BELIEVE ME COMING FROM A SERVICE MEMBER THAT'S BEEN THERE AND DONE THAT ITS VERY CLOSE TO THE REAL THING. THE FEEL, JUST YOU AND YOUR BUDDY, MANY KLICKS BEHIND THE LINES, YOU MAKE THE CALL! CAN YOU HACK IT? SPEND THE CASH AND FIND OUT!"
1,Since When Can People Shoot Through Hills?,"Maybe I'm loosing it, but since when can your enemies shoot you through hills? I'm all for inventive games but this is just too much. Not to mention it's virtually impossible to find your objectives. But hey, I guess the game magically becomes fun if you own it instead of renting it? I guess I wouldn't know."
2,"Way too hard, but worth the price.","This game is way too hard! I enjoy a challenge, but this is ridiculous! I grew frustrated on the easy setting and anything above that is more infuriating than fun. What is fun is playing with two players, but even that doesn't make it any easier. I would say if you can get this game for under ten bucks and only want about five or six hours of gameplay out of it it is worth it."
1,Not even worth getting paid to play this game.,"I bought this game used for $10.00 a year ago and I wish I would have bought a six pack instead. This game is not user friendly and the controls are a joke. My son who is easy to make happy when it comes to video games said ""Dad where you drunk when you bought this game"". This is comming from and 8 year old. The graphics [are bad] and everyone I talked to that owns this game said they played it for and hour and haven't played it since. You couldn't pay me to play this game. If you are planning on renting or buying this game dont waste your time or money."
2,Save your money,"This game is crummy. Very little fun, and it has a number of flaws. I bought this game dirt cheap, and it wasn't worth even the low price I paid. Buy something else."
1,"Stinks, but hey, its cheap","I was a fan of the Spec Ops games on the computer, but I think they don't cut it on either the PS or DC. I will admit it only 10 bucks, so your not throwing away a full price for the game. Even on the easiest setting, I found the game very difficult, nearly immpossible. I did however like playin the co-op with my brother, yelling at him to flank or take up a snipers position. My final verdict, fun for the price, but nothing near the computer."
5,For (this price)!,"It's a pretty good game, (for the price). Iwas in the infantry and it brings back good old memories. Plus the game is hard so you can not win so easily. I own medal of honor and it took me about 3 days to beat, and I hardly replay it. I still haven't beaten spec ops, and I always replay it over and over. The enemy has not yet acted the same way as in other games. If you want a good game that will last you for awhile, this is worth it."
3,difficult,"This game for me is real tough , the missions are timed so I feel that I need to rush to get the objectives and in doing so make mistakes and get killed quickly. This game seems to be fun but very difficult to complete levels which discourages me from playing. It is somewhat like Rainbow 6 but much more difficult. I've tried to locate hints on the internet and have been unsuccesful so far.Looks like i'll need the strategy book."
2,Did not keep my son's interest,"These Pokemon keychains are about 2 5/8"" in diameter, a little too big to use as a keychain. They are better used clipped to a backpack or something similar. The puzzle pieces are made of hard plastic which slide smoothly. Each puzzle piece is numbered in the small type in the upper lefthand corner, so the pieces will form the a Pokemon image when arranged in numerical order. The puzzle is not too difficult for my 8 year-old son to figure out. Although he is a Pokemon fan, he did not take much interest in these puzzles."
2,Disappointing,"The advice is too general and commonplace. I found this book to be greatly inferior to Stephanie Winston's Getting Organized and Lehmkuhl and Lamping's Organizing for the Creative Person. For someone really trying to come to terms to with their clutter and messiness, those two books are the place to start."
5,Get your life back,Get your life back with these easy to follow tips. I love Julie Morgenstern. She is amazing.
4,At least I can get a start on getting organized now,"This book gives step by step instructions for how to get organized. Some areas didn't apply to me and I wish she had a resource list but other than that, it was great."
1,Just another book,...Most everything in this book requires purchase this or purchasethat. This book was written for people with money to burn. You dontneed to buy lots and lots of expensive storage items like this bookrecommends .Just check out some of the web sites like trash totreasures instead of buying this book. If you really want to organizeon a budget rather than spending a small fortune on things to orginizewith that end up as clutter when all is said and done. Use your brainand save your wallet. END
3,"Interesting, but it takes effort","The book is well written and holds good advice. However, it takes an effort and discipline to follow up with sorting and filing - and that turns out to be the major problem, even if all other challenges (storage, putting away stuff that is no longer needed) is mastered. It is a good guideline for people with new homes."
1,Amateur Hour,"I purchased the Julie Morgenstern video and audio tapes as Iwas hoping to get an organization jump start. I found the video to be dull, slow and boring. And it was no surprise to find the same qualities in the audio series. If you have never seen a file folder then this is a must have. For anyone who has even some rudimentary understanding of how to manage time, I recommend you look somewhere else. I found the information contained in Ms. Morgenstern's presentations worthless."
3,Some really good information; some not so useful.,"The first few chapters, where Morgenstern discusses her general method for organizing and obstacles that get in the way of organizing, were extremely useful. Unfortunately, the rest of the book, where she goes room-by-room, was of little use to us; I have other books that give better tips for individual rooms. I'm glad I bought the book, but I'd be happier if I'd bought it for $5 in a clearance sale."
3,Good insight!,"I bought this hoping to help find out why my organizing fizzles. So far it has provided the much needed insight into why, now I just need to get to the how to overcome & move forward. This is helping me find out why I am always frustrated with trying to organize and turning around to an even bigger mess! I still have to finish the book and I think it may help me figure out how to move beyond the initial steps of organizing."
5,Not Your Average Organizing Book,"I have purchased and read many organizing books and this one is by far the best. It's not just a book about what to buy to organize your things or what to throw away to make room, but a book that makes you stop and really think about why and how you've gotten to the point of being disorganized and cluttered. From there you are provided action plans and suggestions on how to turn it all around. For those of you who love organizing, I highly recommend this book."
4,organizing from the inside out,"This book is great, it helps to break down the steps to get organized. I could start to really make some progress in my clutter. Having a designated place for everything was such a great tip that I found myself getting sidetracked cleaning out other things to find the space. I already knew about the 3 boxes to separate into but i am now more determined to let go of some things and be fine with that. I grew up in a household with parents that grew up during the depression , so a waste not attitude is embedded in me, but now I try harder to find someone that can use what I can't because of that value. I feel each time I tackle an area I am making progress and that is so good for the thought that oh i will never get this all organized. I have control and it is a work in progress. I highly recommend it."
2,Organizing from the Inside Out: The Foolproof System for,"While this book is extremely detailed, it is overwhelming for someone trying to ""simlplify"". The chapters and layout would be better served as tip sheets, rather than lengthy case studies with tips buried inbetween."
1,Don't Bother,"Ignore the hype. This book is terrible, and certainly not for the really organizationally-challenged. This book did not change my life, it just became another dust-collecting waste of money. Also, it's a cheap quality book with thin paper and hard-to-read type. I was totally disappointed."
1,Save your money,"I was totally disappointed with this ""self help"" book. Nothing concrete, just concepts. Very little information I was able to use. Fluff piece."
1,Book itself needs to be organized,"I am a busy professional who wants to simplify my life. This book was overly cumbersome in that it is too long and drawn out. If you have the time to read this, it may be for you; for my part, I lost patience. I need simplicity;not a thesis."
3,good/informative...,i've read a handful of outlines in this vien. this guide should b considered with other guides. it's not a guide onto itself.
3,"Some good stuff here, but","If you think you're a cluttered person who can't ever get organized, you will probably find this book very useful. But as informative as it is, I felt it was written poorly. Though the ideas are good, the first few chapters read like a generic self-help book so I found myself skimming through the entire book and trying hard to find the important points that are worth reading. It's unfortunate that you have to wade through anecdotes and pseudo-psychology in order to get a few good tips on organizing. But if you read it quickly and end up with an organized home, then it's worth the time."
4,Excellent content but a bit repetitious,"I got a lot of good ideas from the book. It is repetitious in that many of the chapters repeat the same ideas in different contexts, and some of those contexts are pretty similar. For example, she has separate chapters on the home office, the business office and the business cubicle. She certainly demonstrates that there are enough differences to discuss them separately, but there are also enough similarities that she repeats herself. However, I like the book, enough to buy several copies for presents."
5,Tired of being called a slob or pack-rat?,"Like anyone who has ever suffered from any form of a human deficiency, it is much easier to take counsel from a convert rather than from someone who has always done things ""perfectly"" (even though I love Martha Stewart too...) That is why this book has given me the inspiration to begin to attack my clutter. Before plunging into helpful ideas on HOW to get yourself organized, the first half of the book is dedicated to WHY you aren't already organized. Finally, I was able to understand why I couldn't (until now) keep a clean house. It's been a godsend...thank you Ms. Morgenstern!"
5,Very good Reading,I really enjoyed reading this book and usually this type of book can be a little dull. It was very motivating and she didn't just tell you to throw all your stuff out. She gave good advice on how to organize the things you have and want to keep. She also had a way of not sounding judgemental of people just because they had a problem of keeping everything.
5,She's God sent,"Almost everyone needs a Julie Morgenstern in their life. Her books, audio and videotape are a must have for anyone trying to cope, survive and manage their living, work and interior spaces. I'd suggest getting the videos', thereby you'll actually get to see what she is talking about. This will increase the chances of getting the effective results you need!"
5,worth the read,I've been trying to get organized for a while and this book has helped me more than others. It really focuses on the planning before diving in to attack. That was the part I have been skipping. Now I know what I've been doing wrong and how to correct it in the future.
2,Be Careful When Ordering This DVD/Region Problem,"When the DVD was ordered it was not for usage in the United States. When ordered it did not say anything in the description about this DVD was unable to use in the USA.After being received the DVD did not work. It showed up as a region error. When the seller MOVIE MARS, was contacted they refused to give a full refund. They claimed that one should know about these things. It was pointed out by customer service from Movie Mars that only when clicked on the picture of the DVD a different region other than the USA appears."
5,Brooklyn Gothic,"Here is a pretty great book. Jeez, what a book. And what a subject, what a person. RUNNIN' WILD is a readable readable book about a great crazy person, a person who came of age in an age when there were no other people like her to come of age alongside her. She is the modern woman, before there were modern women, suffering from the wild range of modern problems, before there were modern problems, and, hence, before there were modern solutions. David Stenn has written a stylish, memorable and heartfelt-feeling book about Miss Clara Bow, of Brooklyn. He has made a dead person alive with his book, and isn't that the great thing that biography can do? I read this book cover to cover and then back again."
4,very good story..,"I enjoyed this book about the ""it"" girl..but it was sad that she was taken advantage of they way she was."
5,"Moving, hilarious, heartbreaking","David Stenn-Clara Bow: Runnin' wild, Penguin (1988)>>>Stenn has found out as much to know about Clara Bow as it is given to mortals to know; he takes an intelligent approach, neither too solemn nor too flip, and the story he has to tell is almost always engrossing. (The New York Times )<<<The last of my current troika of star biography reviews, after Stewart and Cooper, another ""heavy"": featherlight Clara Bow, who's story borders the tragic, were it not almost banal for the many stupidities that led to such an outcome.fbus67 - David Stenn-Clara Bow: Runnin' wild -Moving, hilarious, heartbreaking - 18/10/2012"
4,I give this four stars with some apprehension...,"Why do I give this four? I'd rather give this book three stars for the writing... but it is well researched... but the interviews that were conducted only give one side of Clara... which simplifies this complicated star of the Silver Screen.Ultimately, I give this book four stars because I'm just so gald that there's a biography about Clara Bow out there. I wish I could give this book five stars.Stenn clearly feels for his topic; Clara Bow. That's evident in the his writing. Sometimes, this can be tiresome. At other times you wish he'd pick up the pace. Despite this, David Stenn acknowleges the complexity of Bow, and he tries to explore that in this book.Invaluable to any fan of Bow, I recommend to the biography or film fan in general to first read the excerpt provided by Amazon."
2,"horribly written, but nevertheless entertaining","Film biographies often leave a lot to be desired as far as the writing is concerned, but this one may be the worst I've read. Apart from the clumsy, romance novel/gossip column style, there are numerous inconsistencies. The author will make a sweeping statement about Clara's personality --- turning her into a somewhat shallow, if cloyingly sweet person --- and then contradict himself a few pages later with a quote from Clara, herself. She seems to have been quite a complex and interesting woman, deserving of a less sugar-coated portrait. And then there's the strange mixture of prissiness and homophobicness in certain passages... And perhaps strangest of all is his bizarre defensiveness regarding embezzler and blackmailer Daisy Devoe (whom he thanks profusely at the beginning of the book). Nevertheless, the subject matter is so fascinating, the book remains enjoyable and interesting throughout."
1,** Don't waste your money **,"The best thing this book has going for it is the Bibliography - because if you read that you will be enlightened as to some other books which you would be far better off investing in. Apart from that the book has a 'pretty' cover - so if you want to waste your money on a 'pretty' picture & a good Bibliography then go ahead & buy this book. Do yourself a favour - skip this one & invest in something like Joan Haslip's 'Marie Antoinette' or 'The Fatal Friendship' by Stanley Loomis, or even 'Louis and Antoinette' by Vincent Cronin."
5,Very Pretty Watch!,"Sometimes it's hard to discern a product on the web, but Amazon does such a great job at it! This watch was pretty in pictures, but tons more nicer once it arrived in my mailbox! It's a great watch for casual or work dress and has that touch of class (read: bling) to take it out on the town. Unfortunately, the battery was dead when I received it, but I'll take care of that.If the watch is just plain dead, I'll return it to Amazon...either way, this was a great value and extremely pretty watch."
5,not the same old grunge crap being spewed out every day,"this album is good,but live this band steps up another level. music these days seems to have lost touch with it self(for the most part). The melodies are refreshing. the groove/beat real, not mechanical and processed. although i've listen to this cd about a million times it has only grown on me more. although seville tends to lean to the natalie merchant ""easy listening"" side, she also can belt it out with the best of 'em. rubino tends to fall back to 80's style of soloing, but its actually pretty cool. this band is gonna go to the top and stay there."
1,exceptionally bad video,"what a waste of my money purchasing this dvd , i have never considered criticize a video show until this one. to add insult it was in Bluray to make matters worse, i'm not blaming the acrobatic troupe who were trying to perform there show but the organizers and camera crews mainly, let's face it, who want to sit and watch an ice rink fail to freeze, by the time it almost had the poor kids were so dissapointed and downhearted one would have to feel sorry and as frustrated as they. it would pay the producers and executives of a show this bad to sit down and watch it first before releasing it, and i must say it did not live up to my standards of what 1920 x 1080p presentation should be . i hope they try to achieve a better endeavor next time around."
4,"Good resource, but not the tell all book","Barbara Israel's book is full of very good information regarding representative style, period, material, and vendor resource. Her knowledge is impressive, but I do think she stops short in providing as expansive an offering of ornamentation as she might have, especially for gardeners looking to embellish their gardens with something other than plant material . For the really interested reader, House of Boughs by Marjoie Henderson and Elizabeth Wilkinson is THE book. It offers information on over five centuries of garden ornament and furniture, water features, follies, and so on. Unfortunately, this book is out of print. If you can find it, buy it...you will not be sorry."
5,The Best of Hollywood's Golden Age,"I have had the priveledge of knowing Murray Garrett for over 25 years as a business associate and friend. I was completely blown away by his incredible talent as a photographer and writer. This book captures a Hollywood that I remember as my home town and really was the entertainment capitol of the world. The pictures are unique, and definitely candid. Murray's comments about the stars shed new insights into the personalities and quirks of some of the most loved and famous celebrities of the era. A beautiful collection of memorys from a man who approaches Hollywood from an honest, compasionate and humorous point of view. Highly recommended."
2,Mahogany - skip it.,"ALthough it looks like a pretty piece, be advised that the back made of two pieces of a cheep material held together with duct tape. This is more MDF covered with veneer than one would expect at this price. The pre-drilled holes do not match up and, as a result, it is difficult to get the magnets to hold the door together appropriately. The cabinet took no less than five hours to assemble. When ours arrived one door was slightly warped - warped enough to make it so the magnets don't hold the door shut. Although the company promptly sent a replacement door, it will be another 30 minutes of work to replace it."
2,"Looks Great, Poor Finish, Difficult Construction","I'm usually pretty handy but this shelf was very difficult to construct. I was also disappointed to see that this wasn't stained wood. It's painted and scratches easily. It does look absolutely gorgeous, however."
4,Best out of many tried,"I'm 49 and my body has recently changed so I've tried a few bras lately, and this one is the best. It lifts, covers my underarm-boob (as defined in Oprah mag), doesn't gap at all on my slightly smaller side, shows no seams, comes in skin-tone, is comfortable...I think that's my entire checklist. My second favorite was a Betsy Johnson demi-bra that was adorable but the seams show under t-shirts. I bought a few Calvin Kleins (before I discovered this Natori) that don't address ""underarm boob."" Nothing else in my size (32D) made the cut. Hope this helps someone."
3,It's okay..,"I liked it, but I felt the cup size was too big! I don't know if it's the style or what, but I am 5'5 and 250 pounds, and size 40B bra. And I felt like..the cup size was too big. It's not my favorite bra, and I didn't notice the memory ""contour"" aspect of the bra...The color is pretty. Just too big in cup size."
3,Too large around the middle and scratchy,"I was kind of disappointed in this bra. The previous reviews were great and I was encouraged. I have a very hard time finding bras... I am small around the rib cage and have narrow shoulders. It's almost impossible to find a 32C in the store, so I ordered online based on the reviews. I ordered two.. a tan one and a black one. I wore the black one all day - it fit fine, but man oh man was it itchy by the end of the day. The tan one was too large around the middle so I will return it. I'm hoping the black one becomes more comfortable with a wash or two."
1,Didn't Fit Well,This bra was a closer fit for my shape than the others I tried but the cup was still a bit big in the upper breast area. The construction and feel of this bra is great though.
2,Too tight!,"I may have ordered the wrong size. I wear a 32D no problem in Chantelle bras so I thought that would translate over to the Natori. Unfortunately, the band around was so unbearably tight. I was sad though, because the cups were so soft and the bra was so light. Seemed like it would have been great if it had fit."
2,The search continues...,"I sent this bra back. The straps were just barely long enough and had very little elasticity. Maybe that's a good thing if you need a lot of support, but I don't want to feel my bra pulling against me when I raise my arms. Also, the back band is a single layer of very thin material, and the fabric used to cover the cups seemed like the kind of fabric that pills. I didn't keep it long enough to find out, but another reviewer did mention that problem."
3,I should have spent more money,"I have several natori bras that I love. I grabbed this one because it was the cheapest Natori bra I could find online at the time. And I wish I'd spent a bit more money. The straps keep slipping off my shoulders, the fit isn't as nice, and I'm disappointed in the quality of the finish. It's a shame when the new bra is the bra you go to last!"
5,Great bra,"Like others have said before me, it truly is comfortable. It supports, doesn't show through shirts that are skin tight. The straps are wider than it looks in the picture. Then again the chick in the picture wasn't wearing a 36DD so.....only thing is --imo-- the bra is not attractive. I didn't buy the bra to look sexy so it doesn't really matter but nonetheless I wouldn't wear this bra if it was ""sexy time"" or someone else was going to be seeing it"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DISC!!!,"Daniel Smith is a horrible bassoonist!! The professional and bassoon world agrees that his tone is horrible, and that he's an excellent example of how a bassoon should NOT sound. Many major classical music radio stations, after requests from professional bassonists, have pulled his recordings from their play lists. He is recorded only because he rents an orchestra to play with. Please, for your own sake, do not buy any of his recordings.If you'd like to hear a good bassoonist, try recordings by Milan Turkovich (my personal favorite), Dag Jensen, John Miller, Klaus Thunemann, or just about anyone else...except Daniel Smith."
5,Bravo Daniel Smith,"This is one of my favorite CD's from Daniel Smith's recordings. I am continually delighted by the range of his virtuosity. From Vivaldi to Joplin, the rich tones of his bassoon pleases the ear. I am a particular fan of his jazz performances."
4,An Interesting Look at the Parent's Role,"A Common Bond is a fresh take on parenting books. Instead of focusing on telling us what to do right, it focuses on pointing out what we may be doing wrong. Never does it hold us up to a perfect parent standard, but instead focuses on how each parent has the ability to change the future through simple, common sense parenting techniques. It is an exciting, opinionated read and well worth the money."
5,Captivating Book Full Of Disney Charm!,"Disney's Tarzan, Special Collectors Edition is a must have for all Disney Animation fans! I loved viewing the early sketches by Disney artists as they conceptualized Tarzan and his friends. The book allows readers to follow animators through the their research of animals and landscapes native to Africa. And in addition to the fabulous pictures, sketches and artwork, there is a wonderful story of the life of Edgar Rice Burroughs. This is a wonderful book for people of all ages!"
2,at least they didn't make him sing!,"anyone who wants to read about tarzan should read thje books of edgar rice burroughs, not waste their time with this watered down shadow of the lord of the jungle. mr burroughs must be spinning in his grave like a top."
5,POE REVIEW,This product seems very durable. I'm keeping it as a collectors piece. They are very detailed in appearance. A great pair as Annabelle Lee is one of my favorite from EAP. It's an overll good product.
2,Flag Display,"Some of the information contained therein is out of date. A glaring example is that the law was changed several years ago to allow the United States flag to be displayed 24/7, if it is illuminated from dusk until dawn."
5,great guys,"these guys always have great music on cd and live but they have gone back to being ""redneck"". new album coming out in june or july. they also have dreamin'. if you get a chance to see them live go see them you will have alot of fun"
4,This can be done!,My girlfriend and I both felt the need to do some cleansing and heard about this book through Natural Cures They Don't Want You to Know About. We started it on a Saturday so we could do the water fast on the weekend - very good idea. I was amazed how I had not problem with hunger and even though I have to watch my blood sugar level there was no problem. We felt so great when we were done. This is something I think we will do at least once a year.
3,"Heard great things, wasn't great for me","The book was interesting, made a lot of sense. The person doing the program with me had great results and I just felt awful the whole time. So it's good, just not for everyone......"
3,If alternative's your thing--,"The assumptions in this book come from alternative medicine--naturapathy, homeopathy, accupuncture. Nonetheless, the 5-10 pages of advice that most readers will be interested in may well be of benefit--certainly nothing here to harm, except possibly the pocketbook. The authors should know full well that most readers' physicians will not be keen on doing the hair analysis, parasite analysis, etc. that are the authors' ""recommendations"" for ""functional"" disorders. It just so happens that one of the authors offers these services via mail order, and the other offers consultations, vitamins, and directed detox regimens to readers who might have difficulty without the extra bit of help. Aside from these extras, the book costs too much as it is."
2,"Too much info, not enough fact","Of course I want to restore my mind and body! The title alone made me want to read the book. However most of the ""miraculous"" claims are supported by case studies from the doctors' clinic without a single footnote referencing any medical study. Those who are skeptical of traditional Western medicine MIGHT enjoy reading this. However, I found that this book promoted a lot of unsubstantiated claims to cure whatever ails you. Too good to be true usually is."
2,Photocopy reprint - bad quality,"From an information perspective I would give this work a 4.5, there is some original opinion slid between the lines in numerous places, however the description of ritual work and the inner workings seem to be authentic and real. This is a photocopy re-print of the original work, and on many pages the photocopy is terrible - difficult to read, and simply needs to be re-typed to get the clarity back."
3,Not Current,"Warning, this book i smeant to go with the IRC(2000) revision, not the current IRC(2003). The information is still good, but you'll have fun trying to cross-reference sections to the 2003 version of the IRC."
3,"A bit basic for the professional, perhaps valuable for a student.","Ching always does a good job of clearly illustrating aspects of design and construction, but in this case the book lacks depth. Only the most basic codes are included and it is of little or no help for the building professional."
3,"For Design, It's Great. For Code Enforcement or Plans Review, Not So Much","I purchased this book thinking it would help me get a better understanding of building codes in general. I recently started working in a department that issues building permits, and needed to get backgrounded in all aspects thereof, since I'd never before held a position where I needed that particular knowledge. To that end, I can certainly tell that the book is authored by a design professional. That's not a criticism, only an observation about the book's content, focus, and perspective: it is geared more for the design end of the building process than the construction end of things. As such, it's a wonderful resource for architecture students and professionals alike. But if you need to learn about building codes for the purpose of building plan review or code enforcement, my advice is to choose a different reference."
4,For those who had trouble reading the code book,"I have alot of trouble reading any codes: BOCA, UBC, SBC...etc. I find it difficult to understand the language. After getting this book last month, believe it or not, I find reading code such a PLEASANT experience. It summarizes all the main sections of IBC, those you browse thru the most, into easy to read format with clear and good graphic illustrations. This is the first time I don't feel confuse anymore when reading the code. For best result, read it with IBC 2000 side by side. It's good buy, highly recommend."
4,Evaluating Code Compliance in Design,"This book is a great tool to use during the design of a building. It applies more to commercial, but is also useful to residential buildings. Using this book will sharpen your code skills and avoid some costly design errors. You will need to have a copy of the 2006 IBC at your disposal if you are going to use this book in any serious way. It is organized in a logical format, but you can easily skip around and cover critical sections. The only thing that I think should be added to this book is a checklist for each type of construction that could be used for plan review. All of my work is in residential so a checklist would help me focus on the pertinent sections of the book."
1,Terrible sound,"It is impossible to judge the music or voices in this new piece because the sound quality is so bad. It sounds as if it were recorded on a cassette deck smuggled inside, in the pocket of someone sitting in the 3rd balcony."
1,Copy of another album under a different name.,"As a long time George Jones fan I bought this album with anticipation. What a disappointment! It is an exact copy of his excellent album ""Live in Tennessee"". On the rear cover though it is listed as being recorded at the ""KNOXWOOD Civic Coliseum"" Tennessee. I guess that must be around the corner from the one in KNOXVILLE! Wrapping it up in another cover, with a different name and bad spelling, is what I would expect on a cheap asian import. Not something I expect from the USA. The freight (to Australia)cost me more than than the album only to find it is a poor knock-off."
5,Very well designed with great illustrations.,This is an exceptional book. I have had the opportunity to teach the material in this book and find it to be very helpful and easy to understand.
5,Perfect book for ILE.,"The book is excellent, one should have this book for refrence in personal library. special area of this book is its programming assignments."
1,Terrible,The screen moves ~ sligthly nauseating ~ and the game play is terrible. I would not recommend to anyone.
3,Looks Good but Could Perform Better,"I'm not exactly an extreme sports person but am just the average hiker who enjoys moderately difficult trails in all seasons. To be honest, although I've received many compliments on the appearance of these, I found their performance didn't match up out on the trail. They don't seem to have cushioning in the right spots around the ball of the foot resulting in a certain amount of pain toward the end of a long hike. I also find the fit is such that my foot slides toward the outer edge of the shoe as I walk. I've had better experience out in the field with Keens. However, as these are nice looking, I've been using them to run errands and for casual social events and thus, the 3 star rating."
1,Why are there no lists of song titles on this CD?,Why would anyone buy this if they have NO CLUE as to what is on this CD? PLEASE start listing on you karaoke CDs what is on them!
3,"good songs; however, is it cdg w/graphics?",these are good songs. i just need to know if your cds are cdg compatible (w/graphics). thanks
5,MNZ,KELLEYS IS A TEXTBOOK FOR THE PRACTICING PHYSICIAN. FAMILY PRACTITIONERS AND HOSPITALISTS BENEFIT MOST. PERHAPS THE NAME SHOULD BE CHANGED TO INTERNAL MEDICINE FOR FAMILY PRACTITIONERS AND HOSPITALISTS.I WOULD APPEAL TO OTHER PUBLISHERS TO BRING OUT A NEW EDITION OF THIS MOST EXELLENT AND HELPFUL TEXT.
1,Poor is being generous,"This CD seems to illustrate the worst out of creativity by committee. There are no great tunes here, I hate to rain on the parade of praises this CD is getting, but here we have 3 great artists (actually I only know Monte and Brown), who I love and combining them results in mush. Bland, unimaginative, boring music. Incredible."
4,very cool groove,"This appealing recording features strong vocals,expert, relaxed playing and a nice contemporary ""world"" groove.Mostly acoustic, it features great guitar and percussion and combines elements of folk and jazz with a contemporary Brazilian sound."
5,Natural and Beautiful,"I listen to it and find myself discovering little things going on...It's Fresh, Relaxing and Beautiful!!!Wonderful compositions...and it sounds so Natural!!!U just Buy the album and put a smile in Ur face...;)"
5,I love this pillow,"This pillow is perfect for me. I have a ""bulged disc"" (not quite herniated). This pillow is great because it allows me to sit with my back properly supported. I have 2 of these: one for the home PC chair, and one at the office. Strongly recommended if you need to sit without slouching."
3,Nice but imperfection exists!,"If we want to list the salient aspects of this model over other models by the same manufacturer, we should mention:1. Photo Sensor2. Push button to stop color change3. 7 colors4. Smooth color changeAfter using it for some time, it began to display and change only between THREE colors:1. Green2. Cyan3. Blueand then it turns off for a few seconds!The other FOUR colors aren't displayed at all! Unplugging it for some hours and then plugging it back does NOT solve the problem.I'm not sure whether mine has this problem or this is a generic issue with the device.With that said the last two features are not there in full for me."
1,Discontinued one much better,"I purchased this as an alternative to an earlier model i saw in a friend's house. The 'original' Megabrite MB-NL9A1-5 looked like a jewel which threw rays of lite all over the room and has been discontinued..By contrast, this is just an irritating monster. The colors rotate too fast, with a fade to black that feels as if i were being hit on the nose with a spoon every few seconds.If i were epileptic, i would suspect this thing would drive me to seizures.Please bring back the discontinued model.Thanks,-Bobby Koch"
1,fails in less than a year,"I bought five of these night lights from Megabrite in a package from a different vendor. Two of them failed within 10 months. So much for a guaranteed lifetime. Fortunately, I received a full refund since the package stated ""guaranteed replacement within one year at store of purchase""."
5,Loved it!,I just received this and the design is more slim and modern than pictured. The variety of colors and modes are very fun. This was well worth the money just for these two reasons alone. Haven't determined how long the light will last because I just received it.
3,Worked for 2 minutes. Revised.,"I plugged in to see what it looked like. It worked, I unplugged it. Went to show my husband a day later, plugged it in....it doesn't work anymore. I was plugging it in to my bathroom with no windows, same outlet both times.Update: Maybe it was the outlet it was plugged in, this things works now. It is incredibly fickle to change the color. I don't like it changing colors, I wanted it set to one color and stay. But it still works 90% of the time."
2,Pretty dim,"The colors are cool, but it's really night that bright at all. Hardly lights a small room's floor."
5,An awesome nightlight!,"Love this! Love how there is no lightbulb that needs changing.. love that it changes colors.. Everyone who sees it asks me where I got it from. My mom said, ""Why didn't you get me one??""Only negative is, my son loves it so much he's always taking it out of the socket and trying to put it back in :("
1,Bad policy for return defective item,Amazon has a bad policy for defective items. They don't have one. I will never order again. Your company is very bad.
5,Coolest Night Light Ever,This is the most innovative night light I have ever seen. I love the fact that you can set the light to 7 different colors. It also gives off the perfect amount of light. I would definitely recommend this night light to anyone. Great product.
1,Junk,DOA. Didn't work when plugged in. The only good news is that Amazon has an excellent return/refund department.
1,First shipment and replacement don't work,"I ordered one after the good review and it came DOA. I tried multiple outlets that had functioning nightlites in them already so I know the power is fine. Then I ordered a second one thinking the first one was defective and the second one was DOA too. I've had enough. I really like the concept and the look, but I'm not going to try for a third."
3,Looking for a neat night light,"This night light did intrigue my 2 year old son. However I will say compared to the regular night light, it doesn't give a lot of light to the room, but it does have a neat array of colors. I tried using both night lights, but i think this one is light sensitive, so if I have them next to each other, the colored one won't light up. Bummer. I just wish it was a bit brighter to ""LIGHT UP"" the room."
1,Terrible,"Oh my gosh, this product is awful! I received the first one and it worked for about 15 seconds then completely stopped working. I sent it back and tried another one and the next one didn't work for even 1 second. I tried it in many different outlets in my house and it wouldn't work in any. I recently purchased a different brand LED night light at a store and it works perfectly."
1,Doesn't work,"I ordered the first one and it didn't work. If I plugged it in several times I could get a red light to come on. But it wouldn't stay on for more that about 5 seconds. So I ordered a replacement (thank you, Amazon, that part is very convenient). But the replacement does not work AT ALL. I mean AT ALL. So now I will just return it."
1,Broke on the 31st day,"I ordered this item and it worked great for 30 days, and broke on the 31st day, just past my return window. It looks really slick when it works, but buying one every 31 days isn't my style. Would not buy again."
3,MegaBrite MB-NL 9A-E,I am not sure where this product was purchased....I assume Costco..MegaBrite MB-NL 9A1-E Rotating color nite light. Well one of the units....blew up. Smoked inside and burned several components....Does anyone know how to contact the manufacturer to resolve this issue? I would appreciate any help with this due to concern about the 5 other units I have in use.....thanks Rick
4,Good nightlight,"Its a good, long lasting nightlight, but it takes about 5 seconds for the sensor to detect the light was turned on or off. I usually just set it on either the white or green because those are the brightest colors. Its nice because you can choose the color you want, or have it change colors automatically. I've had it for over a year and no problems!"
1,TERRIBLE LIGHT,I ordered two of these night lights and they were both unreliable and intermittent in their operation. I would not recommend them!
4,Megabrite Night Lite,"Worked as advertised.Not sure about other users having problems.The color changing is nice, but I quickly selected the color I liked, i.e. blue and pressed the switch to keep it on that.While this is bright, it is not as bright as other night lights I own.Worked well, has a 1yr warranty and the flexibility to change the color is a nice feature if you want a change from time to time"
4,Pretty nice.,I've had this product for a while now and it hasn't burned out. One thing I don't ilke is that it seems a bit twitchy when changing colors.
2,Was perfect...until it stopped working.,"We bought this for the nursery...and it wasperfect! We had it set on blue and it was just bright enough to see to nurse and/or change a diaper, but not too bright to wake up the baby.So we loved this light...for the two weeks or so until it stopped coming on automatically. Now, in order to get it to work, we have to unplug it then replug it and then stop it on the color we want. We do this every night.Also, we had issues with the color changing automatically--even after we stopped it--when the mini-refrigerator we had plugged into the same outlet cycled. I'm glad we didn't spend too much on this."
4,GROOVY NIGHT LIGHT,"Bought these in a 5-pack from Costco. All but one is still working after being plugged in all over the house for over a year. I love the way they change colors constantly. Moreover, I love that I don't have to remember to turn anything on or off!Great nightlight."
2,Watch out for static with these!,"Overall, I regret this purchase. The color changing was a nice feature, and the sensor worked VERY well (came on only when it was dark). The light wasn't as bright as I hoped, but it was adequate. My main complaint: A few days after using the 1st one, I pushed the button to change the color & I unknowingly had static in me--the static fried the sensor or something when I touched the light and it won't work now. If you tend have a lot of static in your house, buy something else! Waste of $$$ for me."
1,BREAKS TOO SOON!,I bought one of these barely over 2 months ago & it completely stopped working out of nowhere! What a waste of money! :(*But when it did work it was neat...just didn't last long enough!
4,Megabrite LED,"Great safety light that's easy on the eyes and uses very little electricity. Choosing your own color is a great feature, and having it come on automatically in low light means safety when going up or down stairs."
5,Excellent low power solution for a nightlight,"Normal nightlights draw more on the order of 5W however, these very bright LED lights only draw 0.6W per light. You can choose between seven colors for every single light, or have them cycle between colors. In addition, you can also select the actual brightness of the light.I bought several packs and have lights in every single room. It provides a very nice ambiance as well as being able to find your way through the house at night without disturbing anyone, and with a very low environmental/energy bill impact."
1,Didn't like it ... THEN IT JUST BROKE AFTER 5 DAYS. STOPPED WORKING FOR NO REASON,"Not very smooth transition of color. Too large clear top portion to reflect the light below. BROKE AFTER 5 DAYS. Much prefer both in looks and quality : Leviton #C20-49563-RNB 120V 7Color Night Light also sold by AMAZON.The Leviton looks really cool, changes color much more smoothly and still works without fail."
3,good movie...so-so DVD quality.,"If you love Italian comedy, this is a must see.Edwige Fenech was stunning in this movie.The only problem is the DVD quality not very sharp but acceptable.It's much better than lots of products transfered from VHS."
5,Very cute!,The doll outfit is very cute. I only wish you would carry the chou bottles and pacifiers. I would recommend this product.
2,bueno,muy bueno el producto me encanto aunque realize la compra erradamente demasiado rico tienen que comprar uno para que vean de que le hablo
3,Doll is ok,"Does anyone know where we can find replacement blanket, bottle, diaper, ect? Those items have some sort of sensor in them that the doll reacts to to make her laugh or sleep, but I cannot find them anywhere. We purchased our doll used and it came with nothing. I agree with the reviews of the doll that says she's not worth your money, but I got mine for $10. The coating on the face tears easily and stains easily, and after a short time the coloring on the face wears off, plus the gear noises from the legs kicking is annoyingly loud compaired to how quiet all the noises are. But it is a cute baby and a cute concept, perhaps they should make one completely out of the same material as the face and make it a collectors item?"
1,Doll Outfit,"I bought this outfit and the Chou Chou doll at the same time. The doll is cheaply made in China, waste of money. It was discarded as old news in a short amount of time. The picture of the outfit here would lead you to believe that there is a bottle included and a little stuffed bear. Not true at all, it's just the clothes. Rip off."
2,"""Authentic""? George Gershwin?","I was instantly dissapointed in the mechanical, yet inaccurate rhythms. His interpretation of piano roll performances is not accurate because the beat is not even. In his non-piano roll performances, there is still a lot of unevenness, and it is hard to hear the beat. In those wonderful Gershwin syncopations that trick you, he is tricked and doesn't maintain the proper rhythm. The ""American in Paris"" is perhaps the most interesting, and shows the most artistic playing, although it still lacks subtlety. I would have prefered to hear the actual piano rolls as mechanical as they are, or other old recordings, and have a better idea of what was really happening in the music."
5,GREAT BOOK FOR ARCHITECTURE STUDENTS!,"This Book is very good for beginner architecture students, it gives thorough dissection of the homes, from original concepts to final results and motives. includes 3 great works and great pictures/plans."
2,Nice size but leaky,"I was really disappointed because I loved the size and design (you can pour from the top or use the spout at the bottom to serve). It took a little while to figure out where it was leaking and we finally figured out there was a leak in one of the side seams, in the top section, so it seemed fine as long as it was only half full but as soon as we filled it all the way it was leaking nonstop. Had to return it and hesitant to buy another and risk the same problem, but I really did like the look, capacity and the portability so I'm really disappointed."
3,job site tested,"I do like the fact that it is 2 gal. with a faucet. It does seem to be relatively tough, it took a few drops, riding around in the back of a truck , and also got knocked around by 2x4. I was very disappointed that the faucet started to leak after only two weeks. I have beat up a lot of water coolers and the faucet don't really go out that often. It's just a small drip now but that is how it all starts..."
5,perfect!,This item came in time (I am a prime member) and was just exactly as it was described. We use this for soccer season and it keeps the water cold all day.
1,"NO, NO, NO!","First of all, this thing is huge.. be prepared. The top was screwed down so hard that it took 2 people to open it the 1st time. After the initial opening, it still was difficult to both open and close. The final problem finished it off for me. It leaked around the spout while pouring. This was a complete waste of money."
2,For people collecting artist-signed postcards....,"If you are interested in collecting artist-signed, fantasy, and greetings-type postcards, as is the author of this book, you will find more than 350 pages of this book devoted to your hobby. If you are interested in collecting postcards showing town views, real photo, and roadside America -- a much more popular hobby, as shown by the major auction websites -- you will find only about 30 pages devoted to your hobby. There is an 8-page introduction useful for all collectors."
4,. . . packed full of postcard information!,"This is a wonderful reference source and price guide for postcard collectors. It is packed full of postcard information compiled from experienced dealers and collectors.As a beginning postcard collector, you will need to fully study this guide and understand the way the material is categorized before you use it at any PC Collector Shows & Auctions. It is not always user friendly ~ it may require a considerably amount time of hunting through several of the book's categories before you find your information. Same goes for matching the photos displayed on the book's page and finding it's related information in the text!Keep your previous J. L. Mashburn Postcard Price Guides. This Third Edition of THE POSTCARD PRICE GUIDE contains all new photos and does not repeat the photos from the previous additions.I recommend that you purchase J. L. Mashburn's Third Edition of THE POSTCARD PRICE GUIDE. It is worth the investment!"
1,Not Worth Your Time Or Money.,"Matt Haig reveals no new insight into branding or marketing. I would rate this book a 4/5 as entertaining toilet reading, but if this book was suppose to teach a marketer something new, then it is simply an insult to you intelligence.What pissed me off the most was the lack of substance in the case studies and the sheer amount of promotion for his buddies books - most notably Al Ries. Why am I reading the your book when I can just get his and save myself the frustration.I am trying to remember a single good piece of advice and can't. Unless you're a complete amateur or a total idiot this book isn't for you. I've seen fliers with better information.Don't Waste Your Time."
4,Invaluable case study examples of branding in the trenches,"This book is worth perusing, if only for the very large number of vivid examples of branding success and failure.Some of the underlying principles are open to critique, most notably the authors assertion that perception determines buyers decisions rather than product traits. Many would say that `perception' is, of course, determined to a large extent by the customer's relationship to the product's traits. However, Haig is on track in so many other areas, and the case examples are so valuable, that the book is worth a look anyhow.Branding can be such a confusing, abstracted issue, that the concrete examples here can provide a much needed reality-check."
4,The 36 hour day,My husband has alzheimers so this book will help understand and hopefully help me help him going thru the stages of this horrible disease. So many things are happening that I don't know how to handle and with this book I hope it will guide me thru. It is well written and easy to understand.
5,Great written support,I have been taking care of my mother for 3 months now and I remembered seeing a copy of this book in my doctor's office. I am so glad I ordered it. When I get frustrated with my mom or completely disgusted with my sister I read pages of this and realize that I am not alone. No one but another care giver could even begin to understand just how hard this job is and this book has given me support when I have no one to talk to!
5,The 36-hour day,"A truly remarkable and instructional guide for care givers of people with dementia or alzheimers. So much of what was going on in my mother's life at this stage, began to make sense to me and I was better prepared to help her. Great book!Nuria FernandezChicago"
5,reference book about dementia and alzheimers,"I purchased this book because a loved one was recently diagnosed with dementia and it was recommended reading. I would totally recommend this book as a great resource for anyone faced with having a friend or family member with this problem. It gives very understandable information about what this disease is all about and ways to handle your interactions with this person, particularly if you are the caregiver. It's a must if you are the caregiver to help you keep things in perspective, which is very hard to do if you are closely involved with their daily care."
