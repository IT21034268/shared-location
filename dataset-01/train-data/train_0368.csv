5,One of best book of American SF!,"It's one of my favorite books,great achievement! I give it a 10 on a scale of 10. Brin unites 'humanity' and 'hard' science fiction. Galactic conspiracy and partisan opposition.On the other hand,this book compels us to think about our neighbors and to take care! 'The Uplift War' stands alongside other sreative works by Darell,Grjimec and Setton-Tompson. This book is inspirational reading,I advise you to read it!"
3,"""Talking monkeys""","I decided to finish the original Uplift series, because so little happened in the first two books I was sure the third would be full of interesting study of the admittedly interesting Brin has invented. In book 3 we swap talking dolphins for talking monkeys. Perhaps a little more believable. One of the senior races has decided to attack and control a human outpost as a punishment of sorts for the issue with the Progenitors (see book 2). The invaders, big ... intelligent birds, are tricked into making more of an investment than planned and also clearly underestimate the human's primate cousins. Unfortunately, nothing happens, we never get off the annoying planet and nothing is resolved. I can see now why he had to write 3 (or 4 or whatever) more books in the series. Just keep repeating: ""I will not read book 4, I will not read book 4..."""
1,SF with Advanced Dolphins,"Yuk.In this series, he includes dolphins as some of the main characters.They wear harnesses with various contraptions attached in order to interact with their environment and they have been genetically improved so they can communicate with their human shipmates.If you can swallow that you may like this series. I couldn't and returned the books"
5,The Last Cookie Sheet You'll Ever Buy,"These are fantastic cookie sheets. I received two as a gift--I had other aluminum bakeware and I specifically requested aluminum, uncoated cookie sheets. These ones are great, because they hold a ton--twice as much as usual cookies sheets--and they clean up so easily. I don't even use parchment paper anymore become the cookies come off so easily and clean up is so easy. Once you start using professional grade aluminum bakeware, you won't go back to coated non-stick bakeware again."
5,Love the pans,"Pans are oversized, so lots of room. Cookies bake wonderfully and I just wash by hand. I bought four and think I made a great purchase."
1,sharp and big!,"These cookie sheets have rather sharp edges, but are basically unusable in my oven because they are too deep for the convection unit in the back."
1,Tape just about ruins new pan,"Wilton - pay attention, the tape you are using for your cover-the-whole-surface decal is ruining the whole experience of getting a great new cookie sheet. I have scraped, used veg oil, Goo-gone, scratched the surface, and I can still see remnants of this terrible tape. I will not buy this item again for ONLY THAT REASON. Do you really want to put your customer through that with a brand-new pan?? I am steamed and have yet to use the pan."
4,Just what I was looking for,This sheet barely fits in my oven...which is the perfect size. I use it for baking with no issues. Its also handle for using to remove a pizza cooked directly on the oven rack (also the reason I bought it). It would be nice if it was slightly thicker. You can bend it if not careful with it in the sink.
4,This is a keeper,"Bought the CD based on the ""Bam-Bam"" name, thinking I was in for rockers with some heavy drumming. I wasn't disappointed! Heard some skin-slamming rockers, some body-swayin' soul and some major funk! What a refreshing sound. Every track seemed to take me in different directions. Ballads sung with such a soulful voice, great funky sound and excellent musicianship! I was extremely satisfied with taking the chance on this CD, plus my purchase went towards a very heartfelt, worthy cause. Winners all around!"
4,Good start... what is next?,"The author weaves together(almost perfectly)theory and practice in an effort to better understand sociolinguistic theories and background. The discourse analysis helps the reader understand what he truly means by cognition, and will allow classroom teachers to reflect on their own lessons and interaction in the foreign language classroom. Mantero's conclusions regarding literature and reader response theory are (arguably) cutting-edge, but more research is needed to support his findings. Hopefully, he will follow-up this study with another similar investigation."
5,O'toole at his best,"This film is a masterpiece, despite it's length. It is definately for the officianado who appreciates period dramas and the detail and perfection in which English acting brings to the genre. For instance, O'toole is amazing as a sadistic Nazi gereral. Omar Sharif is excellent, still his looks do make it hard to believe he is a German Army Major and not a concentration camp victim. The plot is excellently played out over a series of 20 years and a serial murder case which pursues three Nazi gererals from occupied Poland, to Paris just before D-Day and post war Germany."
5,A war movie and mystery (kind of) in one,"A German officer looking into the murder of a prostitute in Warsaw discovers that the suspect has to be one of three generals stationed in the city. before he can do anything about it he finds himself in Paris. The same generals wind up there as well, but at least one of them is involved in a conpiracy to kill Hitler. The movie goes on and it is fascinating to see how the entire thing plays out.I am waiting for a good version of this video to be available on DVD. Once it is I will make sure to add it to my collection."
5,Very original plot line,Great performances by Peter O'Toole and Omar Shariff that complement an interesting plot intertwined with the usuall WWII stuff. The end is a good as the beginning.
1,Very poor quality copy of a fine file.,"Look elsewhere, be patient and hope the movie is released by a company that has the expertise to produce a quality disc. The size of the movie on the screen is minuscule and grainy. The sound quality is good. I'll buy another copy one day and give this to the local thrift store."
1,Disappointing,"I have an original VHS copy of this movie, which I cannot find, its here somewhere, but where...so, I washappy when I saw this copy, and bought it, BIG mistake, it is such a disservice to what is otherwise a wonderfulmovie, and I can't find a good quality copy of it anywhere. With such outstanding actors, and actually a murdermystery, you think someone would do it justice by releasing it in decent quality, or maybe its just not PC enoughfor the company who holds the rights. Ohh well, if anyone knows where a quality copy is available, please let me know."
2,Six of One; Half Dozen of the Other,"Have you ever heard the expression ""he/she's so dumb he/she could mess up a one car funeral""? That quip came to mind as I watched The Night of the Generals starring Peter O'Toole. How any company could have so royally screwed up a fine film is beyond me. The transfer to DVD was absolutely horrendous! I could have done better with MicroSoft Movie Maker. Still, in spite of everything, it was good to see Mr. O'Toole at his quirky best. He, and he alone, is the only reason I suffered the torture of viewing the entire presentation. Ah well, the things fans will do for their artistic heroes!!! My reluctant recommendation is not to buy this DVD. Amazon, I love you, but loyalty ends where brutality of the senses begins."
2,Night of the Generals,Acting and the action moments were vary convensing. This sort of WW11action films are somewhat hard to come by. It is in essence a Who-Don -it type of characterization that is always spell binding especially when the conclusiion makesfor a perfect ending.
3,UNKNOWN QUALITY,"I am going to order this and hope the quality of the DVD has caught up with time. But, I must say, I have the original VHS and the quality was absolutely dreadful. The movie was great so, I intend to try to watch a good quality version. I wish I could just e-mail Amazon and ask, but they tend to ignore my e-mails. Years ago, I heard a movie critic say that a ""goof"" in the movie was that, in the beginning, ""Tanz"" was a GENERALMAJOR or some such army rank but later was an OBERGRUPPENFUEHRER or some such SS rank and that would be an error in the movie; but the the most highly decorated foreigner in the German armed forces (I think) was the Belgian, Leon Degrelle, who started as an army private but wound up as an SS STANDARTENFUEHRER. I've never figured out what that rank is."
2,A strange stew.,"This strangest of 1960s epics from the David Lean stable is more correctly called an anti-epic - it has no vast battles; only a minor love interest; and a mostly interior focus. There are no heroes, just opportunists, obsessives and dangerous madmen. It aspires towards the compelling mundanity of the French policier - the central story is a murder mystery, and some of the personnel were involved in Melville's finest films - and has pertinent things to say about how the Allies compromised with Nazis after the war; but in the end the film is too fond of demonising the old sexually neurotic Nazi villain. None of it works, and yet its oddly watchable in its way - perhaps because its indecision as to what it is makes it unpredictable; more probably, because you can watch Peter O'Toole giving a remote, cold, quietly mannered performance which still savours of the finest ham."
1,this is weird,i dont get this movie at all the start is good and makes you want to watch but then all of a sudden im falling a sleep becase cant figure it out all i know is that a nazi gen killed a woman and framed some guy who is driver and 30 years later or so he is caught and kills him self what happend betewn that time why is this a big deal hes a nazi gen this is going to happen right.
4,"Enjoyable, quirky murder mystery","This movie has a great international cast of superb character actors! It's an enjoyable, absurd, weird movie based on a book of the same name. Peter O'Toole gets the German boy ""wunderkind"" general just right. Omar Sharif plays a German officer (!) investigating a series of murders! Add the ever interesting Tom Courtenay, Donald Pleasance, Joanna Pettit and Phillippe Noiret to the mix and it's got enough twists and turns to keep you going."
4,Nice surprise,"I found this movie while checking my Reccommended List. It sounded good and the price was right. It's now on my WWII movies shelf to stay. If it's caught your eye also, go with it . You won't be disapointed. It's a human interest story more than an action story, it's also a murder mystery!By the way don't be afraid to buy VHS. Many are in very good condition and the price is usually very good.Have fun!"
1,Night of the Generals,"I'd waited a long time for this to come out on DVD and was excited when I found this print available on Amazon. Regrettably, upon receiving the DVD I discovered that the quality was dreadful. This is undoubtedly the worst transfer of a film I've ever seen, and after looking at it for just a minute or so, I found myself getting a headache. The print is so blurred I actually adjusted my glasses a few times to ensure that it was not me.Do yourself a favor and wait for a cleaner version than this wretched one."
1,"Good movie, Poor qualty","I've purchased the movie because I love the movie. Returned it because of its awful picture quality. The foreground is blury, the background is dark and snowy. Take my words for it and don't buy it! You buy it, you'll suck it. supplier must improve the qualty. For $21 it must have a quality."
5,Superior quality,"Folks, forget the reviews carping about quality. The DVD now being issued is the real thing - full length, full screen, and high quality."
4,Great casual jacket,"I love my Pritti Suede jacket. It runs large but it is sized to allow layering (sweaters, scarfs, etc.)underneath. It is well constructed. The quality of the product looks more expensive then the actual cost. It is a good buy."
3,Large fit,"Even though I love the colour and look of the jacket, I was disappointed that it fit bigger than expected."
4,Only Four Stars Because I'll Never Have One,"I love to pick up a copy of this magazine from time to time and look at the mansions for sale, the horse farms for sale, the exotic islands for sale, because, quite frankly, I'm never going to get out of this studio apartment. But that's okay *smile* I'm happy and I love dreaming. For anyone else who loves beautiful homes, or dreams of your own estate on....oh...a thousand acres or so complete with a forest and babbling brooks, this will be fun for you too."
5,Wonderful Magazine.,"This is the home magazine of all home magazines!! I love looking at the pictures and shopping for houses. The pictures are clear and you can find a home in any state you choose. Also, enjoy reading it just before the lottery numbers come up on Friday nights. Very highly recommended! lathamdoxey.com (Author of ""Sunset Point"")"
3,Good but not durable,I love and Hate this markers. I love them cuz they make my drawings look decent (even though im terrible at drawing) but they run out of ink really fast :/.
4,Great for all art!,"These are great for practicing manga, and even for graphic design! I used these all semester for several art classes. They do not bleed or overlap their darkness too much while wet. They are very good to use. The package's markers are half off white colors (they are a bit tan) and the other half of the markers are pure grey-black."
5,HANDY,Easy on and hands pounder gets the job done in a jiffy. It's well constructed and made of quality stainless steel. I highly recommend this product.
2,The pictured pounder is NOT what you will get,"I ordered one of these and was disappointed when it arrived. The one I received was not 4 1/2 inches in diameter as described, it was 3 1/4 inches. The one I received did not have a contoured handle like the one shown in the photograph, it had a straight chromed rod for a grip. Amazon was quite good about sending me a return label to return it, and promised to send me the right one. When the second one arrived it was just like the first one. The quality of the pounder is exceptional, no doubt. But I was disappointed that what I received was not what was pictured."
2,Stopped working,"Stopped working after a few weeks. Sent it back. Replacement stopped working again while I was 48-hours hike from the nearest road, under a few inches of rainfall, and actually needed it's functionality. Thankfully a crew member had a cheap BIC lighter than actually worked. Not only did my lighter fail but I was disappointed to have paid the amount that I did for this product when a ""superior"" product could be had from a convenience store. Now it just sits in my gear closet because I can't trust it to work when I need it. Note that the lighter itself was not soaked. The specific problem is that the coils do not heat. If you're thinking of taking this lighter to any sort of saturated environment, I would think twice."
1,Looks cool but...,"It quit working after relatively light use. It's over a year old and I'm not in the mood for arguing with Brunton about it. I'll just stop buying their products. Like others, I could have purchased a lifetime supply of Bics for what I paid for this junk. It looked like a Windmill lighter in fancier clothes but don't think it is close to that modest level of quality. I may look at Blazer. They seem to have gotten better reviews."
1,100% Junk,"After reading the reviews online (mostly 2 star via backpacklight and here) I decided to take a chance and give this lighter a try since the ascetics caught my eye.Don't bother. The thing lit once and hasn't worked since. I read through the instructions again and tried different levels of fluid with the selector, but--after a single use--it's dead.Consider this a warning--it's a real waste of money."
1,Terrible loss of quality,Bruntom stormproof lighters USED to be some of the most reliable I have ever used. They USED to be tough as nails and able to stand up to most anything. My dog got a hold of one about 6 years ago tried to bite through it and couldn't. They lighter was bent (its a Rockweiler) but still worked and to this day it still works. Fast forward to the last month when I wanted to get a few more backups of this once great lighter. I have had 2 fail within the last month. Yes 2. This is a serious flaw in quality control. It's likely made in China and has taken some major steps backwards. 2 failures in a row is unacceptable. I was a bit surprised to see how lowly these reviews were. Now I know why. Things have changed for the worse in these intervening years. Do not waste your precious money on this worthless imitation of a lighter. Amazon should be ashamed to keep this in their inventory. Brunton should be ashamed. I'm done with Brunton. End of a bad story.
1,Wosrt lighter ever,"I bough two of these for my survival bag and camping gear. One of them doesn't light at all, and the other barely lights, then goes out, but the fuel keeps hissing out of the top. What's the chance that i got TWO duds. I think it's more likely that they just stink. I also read some reviews that say they are great, but they are wrong. Also, since i purchased from Amazon, I can't return them because they contain a hazardous substance...fuel. Do yourself a favor and buy a bic."
5,I love this!,I've owned this mp3 for a few years and I love it. I've actually added a 2GB SD card into it and it reads it perfectly. I highly recommend this mp3 for all music lovers!
1,The worst ever. Do not waste your money!!!!,"This product is a piece of junke, No wonder why there is not any store selling this product. It get frozeen when you are downlouding music, very annoying noises when you get the highest volumen, it turn off by itself sometimes without no reason, and the software is not friendly at all.If I were you, I would pay the same money for a shuffle IPod which is real quality and has 4GB istead of M25 motorola which is 2500MB"
5,Great book!,"Chloe may not have styling superpowers but knows style when she sees it - and when she doesn't. I was struck by how cute and cleverly written this book is. Chloe totally reminds me of myself, even though I'm only 13 and she's 17. I aspire to be a fashion designer and I just loved reading this book and her plight to make this world a prettier place, one outfit at a time."
1,Pathetic!!,"This book is pathetic and very boring. There is no plot, whatsoever. Don't waste your time to read this book. I didn't even read the whole thing, because it was just too boring for words."
3,okay book for a theology course...,"This book is not an everyday item i would oder and read, however, I purchased this book for class and its somewhat interesting."
5,Good Used Book,"The condition of this used book was good as was claimed and the delivery time was on the shorter end of the time range that was estimated. Overall, this was a positive experience."
1,Most stupid release ever?,"The #1Record/Radio City CD contains the same songs and many more in the correct running order. If there would be some lackluster songs on #1Record/Radio City, then maybe this CD would make at least a tiny bit of sense. But there aren't, as #1Record/Radio City is totally solid disc. This release is a mystery and a rip-off!"
2,"Okay, Amazon, I read it--now stop recommending it","I finally gave in after seeing this pop up every time I opened my Amazon recommendations (and, lately, on my Goodread recommendations as well). I hope that this is the last I will see of this series on any recommendations list.The book was boring--no other way to put it. Abby, the new owner of Divinity Candy Shop, was wishy washy and, frankly, not too bright. By the end of the book I was seriously tired of hearing about her cheating ex-husband and the dysfunctional relationship she has with her drunk, self-centered brother and her nasty, know-it-all cousin/employee.The mystery was silly; the ending predictable (even without any real clues).The recipes sounded really good and, yep, I liked the dog. Those two things are the only reason this book gets 2 stars instead of 1."
4,Cute Debut,"A very cute debut for this new series.There were a few too many secondary characters, which made it a bit confusing. But this one's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of amateur sleuth series."
4,Diane Mott Davidson light,"For those enjoy the foodie-mystery genre, this book is fairly entertaining. Although the ""strictly candy"" references and recipes aren't as tempting as Diane Mott Davidson's wonderful Goldie series, it is a good story - well-written with lots of twists and turns. If you have a craving and are awaiting the next Goldie mystery (as I am!), this series will hold you."
3,A slow start,"It took me a while to get into this book. I would have liked a little more background on some of the characters. I kind of felt like people just kept showing up and the back story wasn't very well developed. The murder happened before I could bring myself to care about any of the characters. I'd also have appreciated a little more detail about the town of Paradise. It never seemed to come to life for me and I had to slog through the first third of the book.That said, I did begin to really like Abby as the story went on. Her interactions with her brother, Jawarski, and her sister-in-law rang true and sometimes quite funny. By the end of the book I was pulling for her. She has spunk and I like that although she's a little insecure, she doesn't let it stop her from talking to people and sticking up for herself.I'm interested to pick up the next couple books in the series and see where the author goes from here. Although I thought this was a slow start, I think the series has real promise."
3,what candy apple?,"I read a lot of culinary mysteries and I cannot figure out what relation ""Candy Apple"" has to the death of Brandon Mills except that Abby was making them when he came into her store. This is an OK read but she needs to tie in her culinary attributes to the murder and posssibly put in more action."
4,Didn't pull me in like I expected...,"but I have hopes for this series. I just didn't connect at all with the character in this book. Maybe it is just the 1st book syndrome thing. I will however read the next in the series, I think there are quite a few secondary characters that can really help carry this series along and I hope to get to like the main character more."
1,Tedious,"I could not get through this book, try as I might. I found the main character to be tedious and argumentative. I just couldn't warm up to her. The whole plot seems as if it is following a formula for writing this type of mystery. I am only half way into this book, and I will try to finish it only because I don't like wasting money. But I sincerely doubt I would buy another in this series."
3,Choose Alessandrini's Recording Instead,"""Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno"" (The Triumph of Time and Dis-Illusion) is often called Handel's first oratorio, although it is more a large-scale Italian cantata or serenata, like ""Aci, Galatea, e Polifemo"" or ""Apollo e Dafne."" Handel wrote this, the original, version of the work during his formative stay in Italy in 1707.Gramophone's reviewer (July 2007) says that this performance might seem ""fabulous . . . for a casual listener."" However, its ""fizzy flamboyance"" comes across as ""artificial eccentricity,"" and the conductor's ""mannerisms prevent natural flow and continuity.""Preferable is the August 2007 reissue of Renato Alessandrini recording on Naive--especially at its two-disc-for-one bargain priceHaendel: Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno. Read my review of Alessandrini's performance for information about Handel's other two versions of this work.Paul N. Van de Water"
3,Too bland for me but good quality.,I found this too bland but with some seasoning and rice it's not bad at all.
3,Blah,"This salmon isn't as flavorful as other varieties. It ends up tasting more like canned tuna than smoked salmon. Even so, it's cheaper than other varieties, tastes decent and is good for you."
1,Not what I expected,"I recommend NOT to purchase this item. Look for another one.The lens itself seems ok, although I can't really say, but the adapter which is built in to the lens is shoddy and cumbersome and ruins the the whole deal. The adapter is a quick release type where one end attaches to the camera and the lens simply snaps in, or is quickly released. This would be great, except for two very important things. One, the lens fits very loosely in the quick release adapter. This causes some MAJOR distortion, especially when moving. Two, the housing is made of thin plastic which does not seem very durable. In fact it is so cheaply thin that I am afraid to leave it in my car because the heat may distort the plastic. One drop, even a small one, and it is done for."
4,just what the doctor ordered,this was the best investment i could have made my video and pictures came out great

4,True and Amazing,Amazing true story of one of the greatest leaders and men of this millennium with superb casting. And it is great entertainment
3,instant video - via prime membership - view / purchase to stream,"too long - film too old - but educational, of a man i respect and how he began, Illustrated a good tenacious work ethic, often forgot by youth today"
3,Had promise as an actioneer but fizzled.,This film starts very strongly with action in the northwest frontier of India but then spends an hour concentrating on Winston's childhood and his ailing father. About 1 hour after the initial battle we pick up his wartime exploits again in the Boer war where there are some exciting action scenes involving a train. Then we see the story of Winston's escape out of Boer territory and finally the last 30 minutes or so involve his political ambitions. If it had just concentrated on his wartime experiences it would have been great. The battle sequences they did do appeared very realistic and accurate. The Sudan campaign is mentioned but we don't get to see it. So that is the reason for the title of my review.
5,Ticketlicking Good!,"This is an awesome debut album by a fantastic electro-indie five piece from Bristol, England. I am lucky enough to have seen them live several times , and this is a great recorded representation, capturing their energy perfectly- the beauty of Chikinki is in their clever combination of rocking riffs and futuristic synths and the singer's androgenous vocals complete the unusual mix, creating what I think is the sexiest, slickest poprock the world has heard for a long time.Album highlights? Well, there are twelve, but if I had to pick one it would have to be the penultimate song Time. They may sing ""time is my enemy"" but I think the time is just right for a band that perfectly marry guitars with fat beats, and I predict that 2004 will be all about Chikinki."
3,this was a bumping cut back in the day,i use to really dig this cut back in 91.this cut even sounds tight live.this was Boyz11Men's first big hit&it really was on time.still dig the vocals&the Groove of this track.
5,Good read.,Book arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Needed it for my Communications class and am proud to say it helped me receive an A.
5,If you feel compassion for others - read this book!,"This book is a must read for anyone whose work centers around pastoral care and pastoral concerns. Often the most asked question is ""what do I say when...."" and this book gives you the answers through the telling of a story in such a way that one remembers what to say when. Not matter what faith community you are a part, this book belongs in your library and in your own home whether you do pastoral work or not. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."
4,Gripping tale of Germans spying for the Allies,"Another little-known gem of WWII literature--a memoir-cum-novel about a young german medic, captured by the Allies in early 1945, who volunteers to parachute back into Germany and gather intelligence for the Allies. He has 5 days to work his way back to the front, gathering information on troop movements, gun emplacements, and more. Based on a true story, it's a gripping read as the young German corporal stays one step ahead of the Gestapo. A great behind-the-scenes look at the Reich just before the end, through the eyes of a lowly corporal. Note: the first chapter or two is slow going, due the author's florid, overwrought prose. But once the story starts, hold on!"
4,Good learning for kids,"Not just stickers, teaches the children how to find the missing items on the left side of the page and place the stickers on the right side of the page in the corresponding place."
5,artysimon,"Don't be deceived by the limited number of review images - this book is wonderful, both literally and inspirationally. Whenever a knowledgeable artist says to you ""You can't correct watercolours"" - just say ""Burt Silverman - proof you don't know what you are talking about!"" His ability to transform his watercolour paintings, mid process, is truly a revelation. All his paintings are beautifully crafted, and technically impressive - he's a master watercolourist. This book is beyond the scope of a beginner though - you need to already have a level of skill to get the most out of these pages. Being an old publication, and a time when printing in full colour significantly more expensive, it also suffers from having many reproductions in black and white - which is quite frustrating. But it's a gem, and one of my all-time favourite art reference books."
4,Nice instruction from modern master,"Rated 4 stars because some of it is in black and white, but this out-of-print book is excellent otherwise. It's clear, very interesting, and a great insight into Burt's methods for this little known technique. I personally have studied with Burt and have done this technique for 17 years, and I now have a blog that has clear picture demonstrations of how to do it! I cover some of the little known aspects that Burt does not cover in either his videos or his books.Amazon won't let me post my website in this review, so click on my name above, then click on my website, go to my Art Blog, and see the three blogs on Watercolor On Plate Bristol. I even offer free help, with answers to questions, and if you send me a jpeg I can make suggestions..."
3,Good thought for thinning!,"It is worthy to note that this is the book of HARBOR ISLAND SPA of the HARBOR ISLAND ISLAND in Bahamas, United Kingedom. Many time I want to go in this resort, and Island, but have not yet done alas, however. But, it is worth pointing out: One can read the ""thinning secrets"" of Harbor Island Resort for the cost of merely this book, plus the shipping and the handling. So, the reader must ask himself: Why go to expensive summer vacations when he can tan and eat at home?!"
3,A Continuing trend,"An extremely talented musician, it appears that he is attempting to find a place for himself on light radio stations. The first two albums were oustanding collections, but did not find a voice on radio. The previous album was a step back, and The Door continues that trend. Songs like ""Come On Back"", ""Anyway"" or ""Don't You Know"" are light pop songs that don't distinguish him from any of a number of lightweight artists, and he deserves better. Maybe that's the direction his music is taking him, but I hope not. Hopefully, these songs come across with more of an edge live."
3,PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR?,"I ENJOYED THE THREE PREVIOUS CD BY KEVIN MOORE AKA KEBMO ALOT,TO ME THEY ALL HAD THE DIFFERENT SOUND AND FLAVOR. THE DOOR TO ME IS NOTHING SPECIAL TO ANYTHING FROM THE PREVIOUS CD,TO ME IT ALL SOUNDS THE SAME.LISTENING TO THIS CD IT TOOK ME TILL THE SONG ""CHANGE"" TO SAY NOW THATS A GREAT SONG,THE VERSION OF EMORE JAMES ""IT HURTS ME TO"" IS A UPBEAT FUNKY VERSION THAT I REALLY DIDNT ENJOY `"
4,Keb' Mo' Is A Changin',"If you are looking for a modern day Elmore James or Howlin'Wolf, this CD will disppoint you. But if you like the direction Keb' took in his last record, you will enjoy his newest, too. Speaking of Elmore, Keb's version of ""It Hurts Me Too"" on this CD is my favorite cut, and I admit to playing it over and over in my car. The rest of the offerings lean more toward standard r&b and pop fare, but are generally very enjoyable albeit somewhat reminiscent of earlier Keb' compositions.(That can be said about most singer-songwriters, I guess). In summary, Keb' Mo' is truly unique , and his music is as varied as any contemporary artist on the scene today. Keb', you are changin' , but I am willing to change along with you."
3,Disappointing,I have all three of Keb Mo's other CD's and was really looking forward to this new one. There are a couple of good songs on this CD but overall this CD sounds and feels like it was just thrown together.Save your money.
3,Dissappointing...,"Has a few good songs, but overall this was a bit of a dissappointment for me. His previous CDs were outstanding, but this one seems over produced (same problem as Bonnie Raitt's ""Fundamental"" Cd) and loses the intimate appeal of the earlier ones . I guess some might say he's ""growing"", but in this instance that's not necessarily a good thing."
2,Very Disappointing,I adore Keb Mo but this album disappoints me. I felt like I was being preached at. When I listen to blues it's to get _away_ from things like church and religion and the other ways of the world. If I want to listen to songs about God I listen to gospel. Hopefully he has got this God thing out of his music and will go back to writing blues.
2,forgettable,"Count me as a blues purist that hated ""The Door."" While I thought Keb's second album (which was far from traditional blues) was his finest, this disapointing disc is lacking in the blues but hasn't replaced that feel with anything else. It sounds like mediocre Phil Collins meets lounge jazz. KebMo is an amazing fingerstyle guitar player, but there's hardly any on this album. He has a wonderful blues voice, just a little raspy and wistfully blue, but he sings like he's trying to do pop songs. He's an amazing songwriter, but well, he just didn't write very good songs this time. It's a good thing he didn't really cover any old blues songs - the rest of the album would have looked a lot weaker by comparison."
1,"Cassette and y want a CD's, desapointed.","I order a capol of CD'S and oll the companis send a Cassette, and oder sen 3 CD'S and ist not from LUIS miguel."
4,Pretty utensil holder but a bit too small,"This utensil holder is very pretty and good quality, but it is a bit smaller than I expected it to be. It is also lighter than I expected it to be, and I can only put lightweight items in it."
3,Not bad,"This is a nice, solid, bucket. Only problem is it is a little smaller than I imagined. Other than that though it's great."
1,utensil holder,Cheap looking and not stable with utensil in it. Also different color to my Rachel Ray green. Its going back.
5,"Calypso basics Utensil holder, lime review","I'm enjoying this product very much. First time I've tried this item.I would recommend this for anyone.Regards,ThanksShirl Byrd"
1,Damaged,This item arrived badly chipped at the base. It didnt look like it had been damaged in transit so it must have been very obviously consciously despatched in that state. I had waited a long time for it to arrive. I now dont have time to send it back so am stuck with it. Very disappointed.
5,Awesome!!,Awesome Movie!!! Brings a few things to reality for those who know what it is like to deal with death in the military and what it is like to bury a service member.
1,DVD coding will not work in US,Ordered this from UK not aware coding to play DVD was different it will not play disappointed. Lesson learn from this seller reference DVD movies they are not coded for use DVD players.
3,Good movie for war film buffs,"This is a decent film for anyone who likes war-themed movies. There aren't any intricate combat scenes and the plot involves a love story or two that are a bit thin, but if you're a fan of military films, this one is worth watching at least once, if only for the one-liners delivered by James Earl Jones. Some of the film's highlights (aside from the one-liners) include a star-studded cast and good performances by the principle characters. The movie is set in the ""Old Guard"" in Washington, D.C., where the cast struggles in each person's perception of the war in Vietnam and how they deal with it."
2,32 Country Gospel Favorites,"Music is good but the selection of songs is not what I expected for ""favorites"". It really does not bring back the memories of the old favorites."
3,TV Stand,The stand was moderately what i had expected. It was not as solid as i had expected and it was not as sturdy as i'd hoped.
5,Perfect,"LENNON LEGEND is a perfect greatest hits collection. Twenty tracks of John Lennon's solo career are presented, and there's not a bad one in the bunch. A twenty page booklet has some great B&W; repros of John photos. This album simply is ""The Very Best Of John Lennon."" Highest recommendation.TOTAL PLAYING TIME -- 77:29"
2,Hopelessly out of date,"I realize the book was originally written in 1947, but this edition was published in 1991. The information was not updates. For instance the author talks about how your phone might be MUrray Hill 3-1597. That aside, the pictures are great, but not labeled or dated. And it certainly does have a lot information packed into."
3,good light duty floormats,"These are not heavy duty mats you want if you live where there is ice and snow, they are mid-duty mats that work in the milder and humid south. For the same price ($20) you can buy heavy duty at a wherehouse club, and these send to slide around the floor and need readjustment weekly, but they do the job"
3,Lightweight Use,I thought they were going to be more heavyweight to stay put. They were too light duty for my Navigator but work fine in my Mustang GT.
3,Ouch! Good work out...to suffer through!,"I like the way this program is broken down, presented, and made pretty user friendly.But the reason I bought this was for a 30 minute program I can use each morning.I find myself forcing myself to work out...which is not what I want out of a workout DVD. I want to WANT to do it.Also, it's a struggle to get through. During the cardio, I can BARELY make it through half (though I'm not in perfect shape, I have been working out every week for over a year..). And the moves are repetitive, and sometimes seemingly meaningless.The sculpt interval, the second program, is my favorite. You still have your heartrate up even just using hand weights and the included band.The third potpurri program is okay as well, but nothing I look forward to.If you are looking to feel FORCED to work out...this is good.But I can safely say, I've used this consistently for 3 weeks and seen NO results.But maybe I can a NON-bikini body.... :-P"
2,Resistance Band broke,"My resistance band broke after 6 months. I called the manufacturer to askek for a replacement and this is what the told me:""We offer a 30 day guarantee for our customers who purchase their DVD's from us. We have no way of knowing if the DVD you have is a knock off. Please understand that we cannot verify whether the DVD you have is made by our manufacture. The resistance band is not an item that we sell separate, it is included in the DVD case. If you had purchased the DVD from us, we would have sent you an entirely new DVD.""Amazon offered me exceptional customer service, but I am absolutely dissappointed that the Shape Boutique would not stand behind their products. For that they get only one star."
2,Boring Workout,"This workout is very boring. The instructors are annoying, the setting is bland and the workouts are just basic. I tried each workout hoping one would be worth my time, and I'm very disappointed. I haven't been able to motivate myself to try them again since I was so bored the first time through. I'm sure if you did the workouts enough you would see results, however I know I'll never do them enough to get anything out of them. I immediately went back to my TurboJam DVDs that I've been doing for months, and I still find it more entertaining than this workout. If you are looking for quick results, I would recommend 30 Day Shred.There are definitely much better workouts out there!"
4,Great workout!,I enjoyed this workout so much when I rented it from Netflix that I had to purchase it for my collection.
4,The sweat workout,"This workout video is pretty good in the way that it really does make you work! I like that it has 3 different workouts so that you can rotate doing them, not getting sick of only one workout. These workouts will make you sweat!! Only thing is that there are days that I would like to have a little easier workout, not so hard.. these workouts are all high intensity, so for those days I want to take it a little easier, I will have to go with something else."
2,Meh.,I feel pretty lukewarm about this DVD. The instructors are just a hair too peppy for my liking and the moves don't flow that naturally. I think I did it twice and now it's just sitting on my shelf taking up space. I might give it another whirl- perhaps this is one of those that takes some breaking in. Not something I would recommend purchasing.
2,Same Old Workout,"I purchased a couple of the DVDs in the ""Shape: Bikini Body Camp series"", including this one, and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. The reviews all looked fabulous, but when I did it myself I found I was thoroughly bored. I definitely felt the exercises were difficult enough, and definitely felt the burn. However, there isn't much here that I haven't seen before. I didn't feel like I was doing anything ""new"". Also, the instructors don't really break down the moves for you, and I often found myself lost as they continued into a completely different position out of nowhere. I suppose if I did this DVD all the time, I might get the routine down, but the first few times it was just infuriating. I did enjoy the resistance band included in the package, but it was a bit difficult to maneuver this, hand weights, AND keep up with them at the same time!"
2,Do not purchase if you are a beginner,"This workout is for people who are already in shape and may want a different routine. It is extremely fast paced and requires high energy for a 30 minute workout. I, who am trying to get in shape, could not finish the program and didn't find it encouraging as the program went on."
4,Good buy!,"Three excellent instructors, three tough workouts. I'm recovering from a chronic illness and just getting back into exercising and this DVD was tough for me. Really felt it later, which is nice. Definitely recommend this one."
5,Great workout,I have tons of workout dvd's. I recently purchased the bikini boot camp workouts and they are great. I do one 30 minute workout plus the 5 or 10 minutes extras depending on what I feel I need more of. You won't be disappointed if you just give it a try. I look forward to my daily workouts.
5,Great Workout,"This is a fantastic workout. As someone who runs and lifts already, I sometimes find that videos don't push me enough. Not the case with this video. The cardio had me out of breath and in a sweat (of course, there are modifications for beginners). The 30-minute workouts are just long enough for a busy gal. The instructors are motivating and not irritating. It's nice to see a video with three qualified instructors rather than one 'star' and several backup exercisers."
3,Bravo to you people who can do this,"It freaking hurts. After about the millionth time that it was time for another ""hill,"" I thought that I might die. I haven't put this thing in since the first time I watched it. Good luck with this one. Definitely not for somebody who hasn't worked out before. I'm in pretty good shape and I may never attempt this again."
4,3 workouts in one DVD!,"I love the option of 3 different workouts on one DVD! Cardio, Sculpting, and Cardio/Sculpting Mix. Only a stretch band and 3-5 lbs of dumbells are all you need to get in shape. The segments are well put together and not boring at all. The workouts don't waste a bit of time. I typically reach for this DVD when I want to get in a good workout, fast. Everyone has time for 30 minutes a day! Yes, even you! The biggest downside to this DVD is the lack of a proper warm-up and significant cool-down/stretch. But the variety and specificity workouts are excellent."
4,Great workout!,"I really like the 1st 2 workouts on this dvd. They have a good pace and aren't boring. I wasn't thrilled with the 3rd, it didn't seem to have a good flow."
4,It works,I bought this thinking this is the same thing. It really gives you a workout if you use weights with it. This video helped to build muscle in my arms without bulking up. It also trimmed my waistline.
4,Wonderful!,"This.is. a great.workout. it felt like a stealth attack.. the moves for the cardio and sculpt programs are pretty easy to catch on to, but they pack a punch!it is great way to get an aerobic and weight training workout that does the business and burns calories.The instructors cue well and give good tips on form throughout the workout. They are peppy and encouraging without being over the top manic.This DVD delivers, highly recommended."
4,Great for a corner,"This mount does not swivel smoothly thru 180 degrees. Rather the square rod fits in the 8-pointed star at the bottom of the mounting plate, allowing it to be positioned at 0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees. The plate attaches with four screws. Seems plenty strong for my large pot of geraniums hanging from it."
1,Not quite exact,"This isn't in any sense an ""exact replica"" - since it simply reprints 68 out of 500 plus pages. The Cook's Oracle wasn't first published in 1829 - not least because Kitchiner would have been dead a couple of years by then. The first edition was 1817, published by Samuel Bagster of London. Buyer beware."
3,not what I thought,"I should have checked out my cart more carefully before placing my last order. I wanted one of the new Fram ""washable"" filters, as in ""wash off with soapy water and rinse with clean water."" The Fram Airhog filter I received is the type that has to be washed, dried and oiled using special products. A call to Fram and I discovered they no longer make the filter, cleaner or oil. They said I could use the K&N; products to service the filter. The shipping label on the package has an individuals name and address on it, not the company name from which I thought I was purchasing it. Also there was no receipt, invoice or indication of how much my credit card was to be charged.FRAM PPA6690 Air Hog Panel Filter"
2,Not the best investment.,I thought that it was going to be like the other collection of old school reggae that I have compilated for myself. But I was wrong. It's only one or two songs that sound good. It's too bad that women weren't recognized in reggae music. But this CD just isn't great.
4,smooth,"It's not as dancehall as you might expect, but these grooves are still especially smooth, including the gorgeous new recordings by Nana McLean and Nina Soul."
3,Vos 8610,"Great phone.....virgin mobile service can be a little better...however, I guess that is sprint's problem."
3,Great but eeehhhh,"This is a great phone if your looking for the flip style, or a coloured screen, but the only problem with Virgin is ringtones cost up to $2 and the real sound ringtones are distorted. And The minutes go up like Wildfire.Try finding this phone through another company. May I suggest Tracfone? They have a new phone with colored monitor, however its not a flip."
2,Dont Buy it yawl,"I was so hype about this phone. Yhe ringtones are great but are low and fuzzy. I spent 120 on this phone and Im extrememly upset that I spent this much money.....Ive also spent over 200 on minutes, when all u have to got to is venture mobile.its 4 college students................check it out ventuer mobile .com..........any way..I just think virgin mobile is ok....4 what it is..if it adds free nights and weekends on its card, it will do Great!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,fone sucks,"miserable reception, poor quality and terrible graphics,. at a point i was excited when i had this fone but now it just sucks , when talking you can barely hear the person ur talkin to overall this is a crap phone."
1,I got a lemon,"I bought an Audiovox 8610 cell phone last week and it broke after just two days. I had never had such a letdown experience with electronics before.While it worked I thought it was an okay cell phone. The ringtones on the phone are really dumb and there are only 3 or 4 music tones, all of which sound stupid. The ringtones are also too soft to hear if you carry the phone on the street. One look and you'll see this is _NOT_ a durable phone at all. The all-plastic body feels it'll break anyday now. Well in my case I didn't drop it or anything, it just wouldn't turn on after 2 days. By the way folks, the battery is _IMPOSSIBLE_ to remove, without damaging the phone body.This is an expensive product with poor quality."
5,"Great phone, BEST COMPANY I've joined with so far.","Hey I'm Rebecca (rcitykitty)That other review above about the ""warning of the customer service"" is ridiculous. Once I had my phone stolen and customer service helped me through it, were quick in replying to my order for a new phone, and even paid for the minutes the thief used! It's the best customer service I've seen for any company, hands down. This phone has great features, and cool ringtones. It's a great deal for it's price and it has cool color screen backgrounds. I would give this phone the best rating possible!"
4,Like The Service But Not Some Of The Features,"I like the Vigin Mobile servicethey actually do try to make the customer happy and create offers and new products to the consumer. But Virgin Mobile is not like other pay as you go services like T-Mobile. It seems that the customer is restricted from other sites. With other mobile services you are able to buy and download screensavers,ringtones,and wallpappers, but not with Virgin Mobile atleast not on there older phones. IF Virgin Mobile comes up with a new feature it should be available to every other phone instead of just the new ones. Besides that I still favor Virgin Mobile."
4,Great Phone,This phone is awesome but at my house i get no reception but when i get into town i get reception which is fine since i'll just use my home phone. my only complaint is that a little over a week after i got it the blackjack on't work and it still isnt. i dont know what happened but it wont let me bet so virtually i cannot play it!!!!!!
3,It's ok,"I've used Virgin Mobile for about three years, and the Audiovox was my second Virgin Mobile model. For being as inexpensive as it is, it isn't too bad. My reception sucks, but that's just my area. It sucked on my other phone too. My biggest problem is that the ringtones are way too quiet. If you are anywhere but a silent room, you will not hear the phone ringing. I've had it in my purse between my feet with the phone on high and vibrate, and I managaed to miss five calls in a row. Another problem with it was that some of the cool features turned out to be non-cusomizable, so they really weren't that interesting such as the screen saver and wallpapers.If you're just looking for a basic phone to talk on and keep track of numbers, it's really isn't too bad. But if you're looking for a phone with cool bells and whistles, this phone really won't do it."
4,I like it.,"I bought the Vox 8610 about a year ago, it goes strong and strong. A nice investment for someone on a low budget who doesnt talk alot or for a student. A very good bargain. For the regular plan you pay 25 cents for the first 10 minutes, then 10 cents a minutes after. For the advanced plan for someone who talks more theres 35 cents a day, then 10 cents a minute. Good bargain in my book."
4,"Phone Works Great, but it's on PCS","I have had this phone and the Virgin service for several months. After reading other reviews, let us just say that things like wallpaper, funky ringtones, games and the like do not impress me. I just want a phone that works, which this one does ... and very well. The only down side is that Virgin is on the Sprint PCS net, and there is no roaming. I have a good clear signal when I have a signal, but without roaming it's not that great in rural areas. Virgin's prices are good, and the phone is a good solid communicator."
4,Good Phone,"I've been a virgin mobile user for about 4 months now. Although I don't have great reception here, it's decent. Even if there isn't any reception at all, there is still clear calls. The phone itself is great. I'm thinking about getting the Flasher V7 or the new and upcoming Kyocera K10 Royale. The only problem with the phone that i've had so far is when your doing whatever on it, then flip it closed, if you flip it too hard it'll shut-off and power up again. Also, it may not come back on. But i've gotten used to having it do that. Doesn't do it much. Overall, this is a great phone for you users that hate monthly contracts."
4,Great phone,This is the best phone ever! This is my second phone with Virgin Mobile. I was really surprised with the great quality color screen and the menu. I also love the ringtones. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the backlighting is green not blue. But the rest is great. I would recommend it to everyone!
4,Some improvements over the 8500 series,"I previously owned an Audiovox 8500 and upgraded to the 8610. It is an improved phone in many ways. The keypad is larger and easier to operate. The screen has color. The 8610 lacks the voice dialing feature, but I didn't really miss it. However, I had to return the phone when I discoverd that the ringtones on the 8610 are only 1/2 as loud as the ringtones on the original 8500. In noisy environments, I couldn't hear the phone ringing. So I'm back to my 8500."
3,needs to ring louder,"Phone is OK, but is very hard to heard ring. The ring is about two-thirds what others phone are. I would not buy it again. EVER...."
2,nice phone if i could use it,"I purchaced this phone and activted it online and everything went smooth, until I wanted to call someone or someone tried to call me. I found out that their is absolutly no reception around where I live. So much for Virgin Mobile having a good coverage area it is only in very specific areas. so i guess it is a good phone if you live in an area where you get reception. Good luck"
1,Below Average,"This phone is just terrible, to the point that it's almost laughable. It gets terrible reception, the battery is just awful and, believe it or not, the phone is actually a liar. It has no real idea of how much battery life if left so it goes ahead and tells you everything is fine... then within minutes (and not having talked on it at all) it just dies.Just ringing drains its battery... It's kind of sad."
3,Best Prepaid Phone Ever!!!,I have had thid phone for just over a year and it has caused no problems for me!!!I would say for a price of $79.99 you can't find a better deal!!!!1
4,Very Twisted,"Twisted is a perfect title for this book, a girl Named Abby is motivated to get into the tri gamma sorority. Abby is a pledge there and on the weekend where the upperclassmen take the pledges away for a weekend is were things get really TWISTED. on the trip the pledges were forced to commit a crime to get into the pledge, and during this life changing confusing time, a lot of personal information was released and it seemed like the pledges made a sorority of truth with each other. I would suggest this to a age between 10 and 18 it had the childs horror with some weird twists for older kids. I would suggest this book to anyone in this age range and give it 4 stars"
1,SMELLY!,"These baskets, while generous in size, are SO smelly. they smelled like turpentine. I'm sure it was the paint on the basket. The liners also smelled and after 2 washes I still couldn't use them. My husband now uses them in the garage."
2,Too limited and proprietary to be useful,"It's a nice attempt, but the Ximeta device is too limited to be useful. A network storage device where only one computer can write to the drive?? What were they thinking? I'm also put off by the special drivers that must be loaded to access the drive. My user has Macs and PCs at home, and this drive isn't cutting it. We're back on the hunt for a better solution. Hopefully one that uses standard TCP/IP and doesn't need special drivers for basic operation."
1,Good Idea bad workmanship,"I had purchased an 80gb version and within two months the power switch became very 'touchy'. that is not wanting to stay on. Then the rear AC adaptor plug was also loose, while pulling out the plug and reinserting I got an arc and a small puff of smoke came out. I emailed their support and they asked that I send it in and see if they could salvage the hard drive. Ok I admit that I became impatient at this point and decided to get a second one from office depot. I opened both cases and swapped the internal hard drives thinking that is was only the power connection. I know not the best idea, but I was desperate for the information I stored on it. After adding the power to the second one it also shorted out, and both models are useless. I think the second part of the story is my fault, but defiantly not the first part. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone that needs a reliable storage device."
1,Power switch problems too,Have the same problems with the power switch crapping out. Lost over 400gigs of photos. Can not recommend.
2,"Great, when it works...","Unfortunately, I must agree with some of the other reviewers of this product. The drive works fine ... except when it doesn't. I've had my PC (which runs Windows XP Pro) lock up more than usual ever since I got this drive. Ximeta tech support is usually pretty responsive but their tech people give conflicting information. One will tell me that they've never heard of my particular problem then another will email and tell me something like ""yeah, we know about this issue and we're working on it..."" And it always seems that the fix is to download and install new drivers which have yet to resolve my issues. I would recommend that people stay away from this at least until Ximeta can get all of the kinks worked out of their product. It's a really great idea for shared network storage but it is not quite ready for prime time."
4,Works as advertised,"This product works as advertised, I use it in the Ethernet mode on a wireless network.The one drawback - I can enable read/write access on only one computer at a time. Not a true net disk drive, but better than what I had. At least I can have read access on all of the computers at the same time."
2,Doesn't work with Standby or Hibernation,"This product's serious problem is that its driver isn't compatible with Windows XP's standard power management features. Thus, whenever you turn off the computer, you have to shut off Windows so that it takes long time when you turn on the machine again. They are obviously aware of the problem and claim that their new 2.42 version NDAS driver solves the problem. NO. While the machine's past driver made windows refuse to be shutdown with a warning message, the new driver makes the computer crash. What a crap! Their NDAS approach has its own merit like fast speed but, imho, this machine will cause serious inconvenience regarding your office computers' booting process."
1,Get a snap server instead,"I have had a ximeta drive for about a year and although it worked well at first, it has driven me crazy over the past couple of months and I have given up on it. With the ximeta drive attached, my computer will often hang or freeze. The only way to reboot your computer is to shut off the power. Ximeta tech support has had me unload and reload about 5 or 6 versions of their drivers...each with its own special problem. Unless you are truly desparate to save money on network storage (as I thought i was until i counted up all the time i spent trying to get the drive to work) then run away from this product."
1,Netdisk Mega,"After reading all the wonderful reviews of this product it seemed to be perfect to store and use for my small home network instead of the other three computers getting data from my main computer. I had hoped it would be as easy and as lighting fast as I had read. It was not, not even close. Tech support is poor; performance of this product is extremely poor. It would take my other computers about 20-25 seconds to access the main database I use, now with this Netdisk it is at least 58 second or more. Even accessing the data the performance is sluggish and in no way worth the money spent. Tech support said I had an old driver. I installed the new driver with no change. Do not invest any money in this product if speed is what you want."
1,Don't even think about buying these!!,"I've had a number of these over the years; they seemed to last a couple of years then have some problem. The price was reasonble so I'd replace the ones that had problem.In September, I ordered a terabit raid bundle direct from Klegg (who bought the company from XIMETA). It arrived without hard drives -- empty enclosures. After 3 weeks of emails, Klegg agreed to send me the real thing and a UPS label to send the empty ones back. That was a month ago. They have gone radio silent after giving me one of those tracking numbers that when you track them say the item has not been received yet by UPS.There web site has disappeared and the company phone has been shut off. (They have, however, announced a letter of intent to acquire a property management company in Las Vegas a week or so ago -- keeping foreclosed properties up.)Scammers? If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck .......STAY AWAY!"
5,Great Product!,"Ive had my NetDisk for about 3 months now and i must say, What a great Product! Installation was a snap. Through USB i didnt even have to do much of anything. I did experiance a small issue with Ethernet mode but after talking to thier supurb tech support staff i soon found the issue to be my fault. But after that everything has been great! I would highly recommend this product!"
2,Hardware fell apart,"The plastic compression fittings that were included with the deflector fell apart after about a month of being installed on my Titan. The only thing holding it on was the two ""E"" shaped brackets that hold down the corners of the deflector. It was rubbing against my hood, luckily I caught before it damaged the paint."
4,Angel On Board,I really enjoyed the plot of this book. It makes you stop and consider what the heaven aspect may be like. I would like to think it will really be something like what is described.
4,A Thought Evolking Read,Spiritually uplifting! I could not put it down . Made me start pay attention to the little quirky things that happen in my life. Great story to remind one who is really in charge of our life. Would have given it 5 stars but too may spelling errors.
3,Love the book not the mistakes!,The story is great! It's interesting to read and think about some of the things that happened in my life that I know were angels right beside me. But there are a lot of typographical errors that take away. I had to go back and reread to make sure I read it right. It would be good to go back and correct all mistakes in the Kindle addition.
4,Inspirational!,"When I first downloaded this book, I realized it was fiction but when I started getting into it, I couldn't believe how some things paralleled in my life. Whether you believe in angels or not, this book was spiritually uplifting. The character development was excellent (although I had trouble keeping track of all the angels) and the story itself was one I could relate to through many of the characters. Are things really just coincidence or does God have his hand in our guidance in life through angels. You have to read this book to see how you feel. I couldn't put it down. Kudos to the author and I'm looking forward to more."
5,GREAT BOOK.. I LOVED IT !!!!,I FELT THIS WAS A GREAT STORY FROM START TO FINISH. ANYONE WHO BELIEVES IN GOD AND ANGELSWILL FIND THIS A VERY ENJOYABLE READ. DID YOU EVER WONDER WHAT HAPPENDS TO US AFTER DEATHAND HOW WE BECOME ANGELS ??? WELL READ THIS STORY AND YOU MIGHT JUST FIND OUT..
1,I must have missed something. . . . . .,"I've been through alot lately, and was looking for some comfort. This was too over the top - things can't possibly be this way. Way too corny for me. Too happy - whose happy to die and see their loved ones suffer???? The things that the angels ""do"" - are too far fetched. Sorry, this one went back and I don't send many back, but this was such a waste of money."
2,Angel on Board - Guardian Angels 101,"I tried, I really tried but I couldn't get through this. Maybe his perception is on the mark, but it just didn't register with me."
5,Great Book!,I am truly enjoying this book. Really makes you think about things! It has made me cry and laugh. A very good read.
3,nice free book,"I received this book free. Nice read. Not sure if I believe it but I'm only human! The first part was the best part for me. Warning, the second part of the book deals with alcohol and addiction. might be sensitive for some. Happy reading!"
3,Angel on Board,"I like the idea in this book, and I believe in angels, so I really tried to love it. Three times I stopped reading it, with the intention of giving up, but went back to continue reading a couple more chapters. I have decided that I have to give up on it, as there are simply too many live named characters, each having their own deceased named angel. It became so tedious, with too much mind-numbing minutiae, I just could not make myself continue further! I read 30% of the book."
1,Wild Imagination,"I read this book because I like reading Christian perspectives about the future and the afterlife. But I do want my books to line up with Scripture as much as we can understand Scripture. However, this one is so unscriptural, it should definitely NOT be on a Christian fiction list. People do not turn into angels when they die, nor do they come back to earth to take care of their loved ones who are still living, and there are no female angels.I'm glad I got this as a free Kindle e-book, as I'd be terribly disappointed had I paid for it.If you're looking for just a feel-good fiction, this is a fun book to read. But do not take it seriously or as fact. Make sure you know your Bible so you get the facts straight."
5,I couldn't put the book down!,"Angel On Board is an uplifting story of how Angels affect our everyday lives. It tells the story of one man's journey from death and beyond, and how he is trained to become a Guardian Angel. The descriptions of how Angels use their supernatural abilities to guide and protect their charges are so familiar, one may look back on memories of their own and recognize how they may have been visited by Angels."
3,Angel On Board - Guardian Angel 101,"Angel on Board-Guardian Angel 101 may or may not be backed by Scripture completely, but it is a delightful imagining of the interaction between deceased believers and those who are alive on earth. It is an easy read and leaves the reader with much to think about if applied to the reader's own life. Had I realized that the basics of the book are based on true events, I might have paid closer attention to the time lines . However, this is a good book to get away from the day for a little while, for a car/airplane ride, or a rainy day with with a cup of tea/coffee."
5,Essay on Church Music,"Just the essay on church music makes the book a worthy investment. It appears that Lewis was not a personal fan of much church music that he experienced. However, he saw the purpose of church music was to glorify God. His insight about true spirituality of the learned and unlearned church musician is priceless. Here he provides a challange for all to consider the essence of our spiritual music offered to God."
1,Lackluster performance on playback,"When you record in HD, you can only playback your 8 cm disc on a SONY Blu- Ray, not any other manufacturer's Blu-Ray's!!!!!!!! When Sony was contacted about this, they said they were sorry but you would have to just contact the other manufacturer to discuss playback options."
1,Be wary of the HDR-UX7 if you own a MAC,"It's a wonderful Camcoder unless you want to use it on a MAC. Sony seems to have a ""cute deal"" with Microsoft. It only works with our MAC infrequently if at all."
4,A book of facts and not guess work,"George Catlin is certainly a man to admire, as is this book.Catlin lived amongst the Native Americans for many years and writes carefully of his experiences.This is an interesting read and provides another dimension to the subject of American Indians.The book is fascinating in as much as Catlin portrays himself as a wordly man and a friend of the Indians ( And he certainly was)but despite that you can still find evidence of his ignorance within the text.Nevertheless he was a fascinating man who had a fascinating life,his artwork allthough basic in my mind, is well worth a look.My only critiscm of this book is that quite some time is spent describing the scenery whereas I would have prefered even more writing on the Indians themselves,that is my personal viewpoint, others may find that intruiging.The book is full of facts and personal experiences and that in itself adds to the validity of this book as musthave for your collection"
2,Good while it worked,"Similar to another review, mine is totally dead. At about the 4 month mark, it no longer powered on. Hopefully shipping costs to send it back to them aren't too bad. Was nice while it worked."
1,Exploding glass,We loved this toaster at first - until the top glass exploded one day. We hadn't even used it that day. We were lucky that we were not standing too close to it.
3,Just okay,"I've had this toaster oven for about a year now. It does a great job toasting and broiling. I also love how sturdy the rack is. It never flops forward when I pull it forward to take something out of the oven.What it is not good at is baking. It takes forever to cook a chicken breast or pork chop. Since I often cook dinner for just myself, I like to use my toaster oven instead of turning on my big stove.I would not purchase this item again as it doesn't fit my needs. But if you're just looking to toast, it's fantastic."
3,Mixed review...,"The toaster does what it is supposed to do. It has an odd look to it and is not made of the best materials. It takes diligence to keep clean and shows dirt and grease stains easily on it's tin like body. The warmer feature is not entirely useful as all it adds is a cover for the top. You get the same result by just putting a dish on the top of other toasters while it is on. I should add that the thermostat control is way off from the real temperature. I discovered this by testing it with my oven thermometer. I guess overall for the price it is ok, but not the bargain it is made out to be."
2,Not enough heat,"I received this as a gift from my wish list. The oven does not get hot enough to brown food, same for the broiler. I'm sorry I own it, it takes up way too much room on my counter."
3,OK but nothing to write home about,Decent oven to heat up small stuff. Even though there is a digital gauge I feel that the temperature is not that great. It also takes a while to heat up which is surprising since it only has a small volume to heat things up!I would use this only to warm things up like leftovers etc but probably not something I would use to actually cook something from scratch with. Nothing beats a conventional convection oven!
4,Only one little problem,"I have had this Oven for about 5 years now. I haven't had any major issues with this. I use it a lot for cooking and broiling. My only issue with this is I can't get the glass clean. I have tried using all different things: Clorox Clean Up, Windex, dish soap and a scrub sponge. Nothing worked to clean the doors on this oven."
1,poor quality,"T-Fal OT8065002 Avante Elite Toaster OvenThe toaster oven arrived December 2, and by December 30th, it had quit working. The ""on"" light functioned, but none of the heating functions. It began again working in Jan., but quit again. I now plan on returning it under warranty. B. Snyder"
2,"Great, while it lasted!","This was my first toaster oven, and I LOVED it! It toasted a cheese sandwich to perfection fast! I cooked cookies in it, and meatloaf. Unfortunately, after only about 3 months, it stopped working, as in DEAD AS A DOORNAIL. There was no warning, it just acted like no pwer was getting to it. Unfortunately, w/o my sales slip & box, I could not return it to the manufacturer. The store I got it from only had a 30-day guarantee.I notice no one locally is carrying it anymore. Hmmm....."
2,Not what I expected,"After reading a couple of glowing reviews I expected to be impressed with the quality of this toaster oven. I wanted something mainly for toasting. This oven has a setting for toast, but it doesn't work. Each time, it changes the length of cooking and the temperature seems to vary. Sometimes I get toast, sometimes bread that has just been heated a little and sometimes toast that is too dark and very hard. Even if I try to change the time, I press the start button and the timing switches to some off the wall number. I know there is a malfunctioning of the digital timer, but it's so much trouble to ship it back, it's hardly worth it. In the future, I will purchase items like this locally where I can return them when they don't work properly.It's a nice looking unit. Also, it seems to work ok with the broiler. Just not with the toast setting."
1,Broken after 10 months,I loved it.... until it just stopped working. And the manufacturer WILL NOT replace it. It is a let down.
2,the oven lost it's heat,"I bought this oven about a month ago to replace my old one which caught on fire. It worked pretty well for toasting things but then I tried to cook chicken in it. After 45 minutes the chicken was still raw. That's when I put a thermometer in the oven to test the temperature of the oven. It was about 100 degrees less than what it was supposed to be. Yesterday I tested the oven again without food. It got hot really quickly but as time progressed, the oven started losing heat. I watched the thermometer as the oven heat dropped and kept dropping.I returned it and bought a Delonghi instead. I hope that one works better."
1,great oven... if it would ever work,"Ended up going to a different product after 3 tries with this oven. The first oven did not work in bake mode (the bottom element would not come on) , the second arrived completely DOA, and the third again did not work in bake mode. Why there is this problem is beyond me, it toasted just fine. Amazon was great, and happily refuned my money.Great design, loved the look, just wouldn't work!"
1,Piece of Junk,"Oven is 50 degrees off while baking. Items were taking almost 50% longer to bake than they were supposed and a thermometer showed the huge temperature discrepancy. Also, I find it more complicated to use than necessary. I am sending it back."
1,DO NOT BUY ANYTHING MADE BY THIS MANUFACTUER!!!,"save yourself a headache and believe the posters that gave this product one star...exactly a year later, I am buy another toaster oven. it just stopped working..."
4,best biscuits I have ever made,"Read the reviews and decided to try this one. Have had toaster ovens before but did not bake in them much because they did not seem to retain the heat. The first thing I made were corn muffins. Forgot to preheat so they were not quite done, but tasted good. Made toast and needed to set time at 5 so it would be brown enough for me, no problem. Tonight I decided to do frozen biscuits. I could not believe how well they turned out. Tall and very fluffy. Better than in my large oven on the stove. I would recommend the T-fal to everyone. Thank you for making it available. Happy baking to all."
2,Fall and decline of Thatre world,"I love musicals and I have liked this yearbook a lot. But there has been a decline in the quality of the book and this volume nearly hitsthe bottom.It has a lousy paperquality and many of the photos are bad and poorly printed. And the omission of many of the touring companies + info on those, there are included are a very poor judgement, Please make them the way they were here in the new millenium. The American Theater deserves that!"
2,A Let Down,Thought I'd be treated to treasures but the tracks not featured on the 'Grestest Hits' album were lame.Don't even want to listen to it again.
3,Better Cuts needed-several cuts are boring,This box set needs a little changing--alot of the cuts are mindless pieces of music-boring and uninspired--I don't know why cuts from the Live album were not included-these are more interesting--Association was great live better than in the Studio except for their hits. The Live album is coming out Dec 9--it is great-do not miss it.-I say stick with the Greatest Hits album and wait for an updated Box that is more inspiring.
4,Almost perfect,"A near perfect look at this group's material.Only big flaw for me is the omission of one of their best songs, ""It's Gotta Be Real"" - soundtrack version from the ""Goodbye,Columbus"" soundtrack album."
5,"Way better than ""Teen Witch""!","This is an excellent book for young people, written with a sense of humor and style. McClelland refuses to talk down to her audience, and offers ethical advice without preaching. Don't take my word for it - I'm just an old grownup. Real teens love this book: I lent my copy to a teen-age neighbor and he carried it everywhere in the inside pocket of his coat for a month!"
4,Ethical magic for teens and adults,"Many young people get interested in Witchcraft or magic, but relatively few can find good guidance in developing their concentration and using their energies ethically. McLelland's book is a valuable introduction, not limited to one religion. She emphasizes ethics and fun equally, and her writing style is accessible to teens without being patronizing. I recommend this book not only for young people, but for adults who are discovering the magic of the spirit and want a light-hearted yet practical guide."
5,Exellent,"I'm going to make this short, but she wrote this book very nicely. It has helped me a lot in understanding magic and how it works. This book gives lots of good information on how to start on magic. It also gives a varaity of spells you can cast. This is an exellent book for anyone who is interested in the arts of magic. GET IT!"
4,A Very Fine Collection,"But, where is ""You're the Reason our Kids Are Ugly""? I cant believe that number was omitted; yet, ""The Letter"" was included? Where's the justice, people??? With all of that aside, this is yet another fine release by ""20th Century Masters"" and their Millenium Collection. All of the cuts are originals (no re-recordings by aging stars), and the sound quality is as good as it gets. I am a big fan of Loretta and I do enjoy Conway's earlier stuff (pre-'78); and have always felt that their duets were definately a working collaboration....I couldn't imagine any other female artist who could compliment Conway's voice that well. Of course, Loretta also worked well with Ernest Tubb's ""Lucky Strike and Bourbon-aged"" voice. I am not too familiar with the numerous other collections of this Duet currently available, but this one is well worth the money and a good ""sampler"" of Conway & Loretta's releases."
3,sweet and sappy,"Not your typical rom-com, and very clunky in spots, but over-all it's reasonably entertaining, with more comedy than romance. It's always good to see Ray Winstone in a role that doesn't require him to beat someone bloody."
2,not what i expected,"not the best tasting, almost tasts dirty. i love the lemon/honey flavor, can drink a box of it a day!"
2,Watch out may have aspartame in it,New 2008 Versions of this product have Aspartame in it. Google Aspartame to see if you may be affected by it
3,I love the taste,I drank this product for several years until it was brought to my attention what kind of sugar substitute is used. iI stopped drinking it all together and found a substitute drink with Stevia.
5,Love this tea!,We really love this tea. Our tea arrived on time in good condition. We were very pleased with both the tea and the service we received.
2,Yuck. . . just yuck,"I honestly do not like it. I tried to drink it several times hoping to acclimate myself to the taste, all to no avail. So, I brought the packets to the office and put them on the ""free-for-all"" counter in the breakroom so my co-workers could have it. They didn't have a fancy for it either. As a matter-of-fact, somebody shoved it way to the back of the cabinet and put a bunch of other stuff in front of it so we didn't even have to see it. It's horrible, I tell you. I finally just threw them all away."
5,Pretty Helpful!,"This book made me feel like I wasn't alone. This is a great book for anyone who has felt rejected in aduld cliques. There were so many stories that had me thinking ""Wow, that's just what happened to me"". Plus I felt like there were tons of practical ideas for getting things going in your community, and new ways to meet people. This is a book for women who are having a hard time making connections. It's not a book for someone who just wants to concentrate why it's important to have friends (which seems to be the theme of a lot of these friendship books)."
3,too generalized,"The problem for me is that the author gives generalized advice without specifics. She has a good heart, and it's mostly about don't feel bad don't take it personally if someone doesn't want to be your friend. Book is not about why women lose friends all the time, and the destructive competitiveness. I found the book is a little too positive and not realistic enough."
4,"If the title interests you, you're on the right track","If you are stumped by the friendships you have or lack, this is worth reading. By exploring the normal pitfalls of friendship Marla Paul shows what you can do to find friends. For some people these nuances of relationships are second nature, for others this book offers the key to understanding."
3,Unrealistic expectations?,"Upon reading this book, my first thought was that I'm not sure I'd want to be one of Marla Paul's friends ... she seems to expect a lot of them, and holds them to very high standards -- I don't think I could measure up! Though I consider myself a supportive friend, I'm not in a position where I can drop everything and hop on a plane to go comfort a friend who's having a rough time, and frankly I know very few women who are. And truth be told, I don't think I'd WANT a friend who's so self-involved that she'd get miffed with me because I was renovating my kitchen and therefore forgot to call her on her birthday! That said, Paul (and the women she interviewed) offers useful insight into the nature of friendship and great tips on nurturing our friendships, and I plan to apply many of them in my own relationships."
2,Baseless claim....,"...namely, that men don't need friends, but women do. Along with the author's occasional jabs at the male gender, this blithe assumption mars a potentially interesting book."
4,Easy read but geared more toward women with children,"I read this book thinking that it would help ANY woman find more friends. Well, while it has some good tips that can be put into practice by any woman, it is largely geared toward women with children. That wasn't the help I needed as I do not have children. If you do have kids and live in a larger city, this book would be a lifesaver. Very well-written and easy to read... I got through it in about 3 days."
2,"Well written, but superficial","This book was full of stories of women who struggled with common friendship troubles and hints about how to help yourself if you are in a position in which you don't have enough friends due to a life change. However, if you are reading it because you don't have very many friends and hope to learn ways to change that, a few hints aren't really going to be too terribly helpful. If you recently became a stay at home mom and hadn't thought of trying to meet your neighbors, this book will be useful to you. If you don't have friends because you are shy, don't know how to be friends with women, or one of the other multitudes of reasons why you might not have enough friends, this book won't help much, but you will be armed with new reasons why it is bad to not have friends."
2,For married mommies only,"If you are a single woman without children, this is not the book for you. I was extremely disappointed in this book, especially given all the five star ratings. It took me less then ten minutes to read any portion relevant to my own life, as it was almost exclusively about maintaining friendships when you are married and especially if you have children. Furthermore, I completely reject the idea that a woman without children must make all the sacrifices to maintain a friendship with a woman who has children which is the premise of this book. Friendship is a balancing act and the sacrifices should not be placed on the shoulders of one person.And while other reviews have stated this book says men do not need friends, I did not see that. However, this book is exclusively about female friendships with other females and does not include men in the equation at all. After all, women can be friends with men."
2,A little disappointed,"I really wanted to like this book as I felt the subject matter was so timely for what I've been going through, as a single, childless, woman in her late 30's. However, like many other reviewers said, it mostly fell short for me. I've tried, multiple times, many of the things the author suggests. Much of the book was written for women with children, however, I did read the entire book despite this fact. I consider myself shy and there's even a chapter about that - but I gleaned nothing from this chapter that I haven't already tried without much avail. I do think the author means well and although I really ""liked"" her, from what I could glean as she wrote about herself, I didn't find this book to be as helpful as I'd hoped."
5,Bogey at his best,This is one of my favorite Bogart movies and he should have received the Oscar for it but some actor named Brando won it for On The Waterfront. Go figure. In any event the BD transfer shows how old this movie is. But beyond that the cast is at the top of their game. The scene with Bogart coming unglued in the courtroom is what real acting is all about. Great great movie.
2,This was a bargain basement copy,"Wile it wsn't mentioned in the listing for this tape, the actual product was recorde at LP. This process was commonly used back in the day to save tape making the product more profitable to the distributor as it took only 1/2 the amount of tape to market the feature. I probably would not use this vendor again, tho' I'm not positive this was a bait & switch circumstance.At any rate the copy flips constantly on my upgrade VCR, making it unwatchable.Will return to Amazon and purchase a DVD.Dlivery, packaging etc were all fine but this is a misrepresentation of what was expected when purchased"
5,A good leadership discussion film,When do you stand up and do something that is probadly the right thing to do. What do you do when the chips are down and others are looking at you? A great way to teach about the unforgiving moment.
5,Herman Wouk's MASTERPIECE'!,"After viewing this film, you may never want to eat another strawberry again. Its themiddle of WWII. We have to stop the Nazis - Hitler's gone berserk. He's murdering millions of innocent people. So whats the most pressing issue aboard the USS Caine? WHO TOOK THAT QUART OF MISSING STRAWBERRIES? A strip search ensues, then a Court-Martial, then a party. At the party, the drunken attorney tells everyone off and proceeds to reveal the person who instigated the mutiny for his own purposes. I think this movie works even better as a comedy. The dialogue probably made Shakespeare rock and roll in his grave. A best line? Consider Lee Marvin's response when the defense attorney asked him, ""Did you like Captain Queeg?"" Marvin: ""I liked him. Not a lot. But I liked him. He acted strange."" (Yes,no,yes,no) If you like a show where the only one who gets in trouble is the one who tells the truth then you'll LOVE The Caine Mutiny. A study in contrast. A study in deceit. A study in mutiny."
5,since when did h. bogart write the caine mutiny?,one of the first modern books to give us an anti-hero. The defense attorney accuses the officers and men for not trying to help their neurotic captain. END
5,Memories of Good Movies,"It is great to watch ""older"" movies.No ""left wing"" messages No profanityElectronic Reproduction was perfect.A nice feeling to curl up and watch a clean-good movie"
4,Well done Classic Bogart,"This along with Casablanca rates as one of the alltime best Bogart movies. DVD version has excellent scenes of the ships and shipyards usually left out in the TV versions. Still packs a dramatic punch with great supporting roles by Jose Ferrer as defense attourney, Van Johnson as loyal chief officer and Fred McMurray as the coward.But nothing compares to the final scene by Bogart-""It was the strawberries!"" as he rolls his ball bearings in his hands."
5,i need some answers to this one,"i'm not sure that anyone's ever going to read this 'review'...i can't believe that anyone over the age of 35 hasn't seen this film!! my question isn't about the movie itself however..it's about something strange i see in the film. van johnson and jose ferrer both look like they've been in a car wreck prior to filming...i've tried to find out if this is in fact the case, but i've run out of places to look for answers. perhaps, some day, some where, someone will read this 'review' and have some answers. till then..it remains one of my all time favorite films....(ps..i was a navy wife for 21 years!! could that be the reason??)"
5,Best version yet----,"This is indeed one of my very favorite films. I bought this version to replace the previous DVD I had from Columbia. I was impressed with the sharper film, however the so called ""special features"" were nothing interesting. Just three film guys talking about the film telling me nothing I did not already know. Boring. I could have done the same talk on all sides. I wish they had secured an interview with someone ---anyone--- that was actually involved with the making of the film. Van Johnson would have been THE ultimate person of course.Great film.....supurbly cast. Cannot be beat."
1,Digitally Remastered? Are they Kidding me?,"The case says this dvd is digitally remastered for the best possible picture & sound!!! I loaded the dvd into my blu-ray player and was disheartened to see a very Grainy picture. I have a copy of ""The Caine Mutiny"" recorded from cable on my DVR. The cable recording is so clear in gorgeous color. This is what I expected from the dvd, but it's not what I received! I am sooo disappointed! I do not recommend this 2007 DVD!The Caine Mutiny (Combat Classics)"
4,"Way To Go, Pinntinajeur","In early December some guy (or girl) named Pinntinajeur reviewed this DVD and complained about the price. Not less than month later that price was reduced by $10!!!! Way to go, Pinn! I'm not saying he/she was totally responsible but who knows, maybe he/she is."
1,Caine Mutiny,Finished listening to the audiobook which was very good as are all of Woulk's books. The movie is outdated and nowhere near the quality of the book or the audiobook. Price to stream was about $10 which is sig higher than it should be given what charges are to see current movies on comcast etc. Should be free streamlined viewing if seen at all for historical purposes...
3,I read the play.. it was better.,Acting...pretty good; probably essential for any Bogart fan. But the script has been maimed from the play. And I could've done without the uninteresting romantic angle.
3,Incompetence.,"Incompetence , promoted by default. I work for a skipper like this man , it would be funny if it were happening to someone else."
5,Cain Mutiny,The acting was excellent by all actors. You almost felt you were there.In an non computer age of fim making the special effects were realistic. and of all things the story line had a moral.
5,Caine Mutiny,"As a Bogart fan, this classic is a must have for anyone's movie library. Bogie at his best with a an exceptional supporting cast.."
4,Read the book!,"This is certainly a good film, as the other reviews testify, but I want to put in a plea: if you have not read the novel, do so. The film naturally had to eliminate many things in the book, and the constraints it was made under (i.e., the necessity of Navy cooperation) apparently required excising a lot of material on the grounds that it would make the U.S. Navy look bad. This is ironic, because Wouk's novel is actually very pro-Navy, and the author, who served in WWII, holds his Service in high esteem.The novel is also one of the best-written and -plotted books I've ever read. They say the pen is mightier than the sword; comparing the novel and the film shows that the pen is also mightier than the movie camera."
4,Full Speed Ahead!,"While the movie is a great piece of acting with a couple of exceptions, the movie does not hold a candle to the superb book of the same name.Some actors are poor character choices. Francis is not the right man to play the baby-faced, heavy set, Willie Keith. The actress, May Winn who uses the same name as her character appears to be a whimpy, love-struck night club singer, not at all like her level-headed counterpart in the book. Van Johnson comes through even if he is not the crew-cut, barrel-chested Maryk portrayed in the book. Bogart and McMurray are superb choices for their roles, as are Jose Ferrer, E.G Marshall, and the one who plays Captain DeVries.The movie is entertaining and worth the purchase, but my suggestion is to see the movie first, and read the book second. That way, the movie will not disappoint.While I found the book far superior, I recommend you proceed full speed ahead with the movie."
4,good product,I haven't had a chance to use it often but when I do it works well. It takes some getting used to on how to navigate around it on the ladder. I'm not sure how often I'll use it but I'm glad I have it.
1,Not the original version from the early 1980s,This song hasn't been officially available since it was on a compilation of 1980s songs many years ago. I don't recall it ever being on any other album or compilation since that one went out of print. It's disappointing to hear that this MP3 release isn't the original version that was a hit back in the 1980s.
1,Limited,"Would not recommend this book unless you have a poodle mix. Most breed info is based on a Poodle mix of sorts.... About 14 breeds described. My ""mix"" of course was not mentioned...."
4,Informative and to the point,"I am purchasing a maltipoo and just wanted more of an idea about grooming, training, and what questions to ask the breeder. This book provided all the information I needed, along with helpful suggestions of things to purchase."
1,Deconstructing Malraux,"This is not biography in a traditional sense. In fact if you expect to follow thru Malraux life, you will be disappointed. Highly philosophical, and complex, the author is focusing so much on deconstructing Malraux's work and life, rather than telling us who Malraux is. Not recommended as a biographical work."
3,Music to get you into the mood!!,"This CD was ok. I bought it used so I was a bit disappointed when it came with a broken CD case, but nonetheless the music wasn't distorted. Some songs I liked were: Can you stand the rain, don't be cruel, on our own (Ghostbusters!!), johnny gill's my my my and more!! I like boby brown's and JOhnny Gills songs better so maybe I should've bought their Cd isntead of this New Edition ""hits collection"".One thing I didn't like was the mixes they made of some of the songs like Can you stand the rain (Lampost mix) and the My my my (single version). I wish they would've just stuck with the original mixes. That's what makes these songs so great, but now that I have the ugly versions, I don't think so."
4,Love It!!,"This CD has all of the favorites from New Edition, B Brown, Johnny Gill, Ralph, and BBD. I have played it out :)"
5,If you are a music buff you really don't have to ask.,If you are a music buff you really don't have to ask. I love this CD. I love the group. Good music is good music.
5,It's all there,Every last hit. Some I wouldn't have placed and was thrilled to find them on this CD.
3,Enough already!!,"How many different 'Best Of', 'Greatest Hits', 'Solo Hits', 'Love Songs', etc. can MCA create for New Edition? This idea is tired, and it's time for New Edition to move past the boy band thing. What's next, a BOX SET containing rare unreleased remixes & B-sides ? You don't need this CD, and it's not because of the music. Save your money, and have someone create a better New Edition CD for you.Peace, SD (of 'Chaka's World')"
3,Didn't quite remove all the chlorine :(,"After a few uses of this shampoo by both of my daughters, I wondered if maybe they weren't using enough of the shampoo, or just not taking their time. When I touched their hair, it still felt straw-like from the chlorine. So I helped my youngest wash her hair the next time she went swimming, but found it really wasn't doing the job of removing the chlorine. The shampoo smells great! But what I found is that regular clarifying shampoo has worked the best (as it was suggested by my hairdresser)!"
4,An album of classics and new attempts,any album steel pulse puts out with versions to established tunes would be great. I bought this for REVOLUTION DUB. Please give us more dubs Liberation Posse
1,Warning...Don't buy from this seller,"Received the product as expected. Had the glasses less than 30 days and they literally fell apart. I have had SPY glasses before for years and never had a problem. The metal hinge where the glasses fold, literally came out of the plastic and they would not exchange for a new pair. I would strongly recommend you not buy from this company as the quality was not like other SPY glasses I have had before."
1,Too bad there is not a Kindle edition!,I can not figure out why there is no Kindle edition. I really dont like to have someone read a book to me. I do know how to read and am not so lazy as to need a reader.
5,very good book,"This book brings the American Frontier to life in such a way that you feel like you're on the journey with the characters. It's a totally engrossing, fast paced read. I just bought this book, and am now looking for the rest of the series. I'd definately recommend it to anyone, but buy the series together, it has a bit of a cliff-hanger ending."
1,I am very disappointed.,"I have never received a book from Amazon.com's services in such a dilapidated state. The pages are so gold/yellow and the book is so shabby, I hesitate to hold it thinking of where it has been.I have paid less for books in far better shape. I will not use this dealer again."
4,Better than some; worse than others.,"If you want to start a workshop without doing much original planning, then this is very good. If however, you are wanting to truly study your needs and borrow from a variety of professionals then I recommend ""The Workbench Book by Scott Landis and The Workbench by Lon Schleining.Engler's book has some good ideas and some practical applications. If I had built my shop based just on this book and then read those other two, I would have been very disappointed."
2,i don't get the rave reviews,I've been using this product for several weeks now and don't see any difference in breakage or softness. This is no 'must have'. I wonder if these reviews are part of their advertisement strategy.
4,Enjoy Neil Sedaka!,"For the slightly older DVD viewer, & especially Neil Sedaka fans from the 60's & 70's, this is a very enjoyable DVD - you can sing along & remember your nostalgic past. Also, considering the Amazon price, it represents excellent value for money, partly because the DVD must have almost every song Sedaka ever wrote & recorded.Buy & enjoy!"
3,It is an OK photo tripod but not video,"The tripod seems solid on the ground. The 3-way pan head and quick release work reasonably well. But there are many misses. If you are looking for a dual purpose for photo and video, you'd better look elsewhere. The pan head is not a fluid head. It does not pan and tilt very smoothly. The center column can be cranked up and down, but there is no locking mechanism to lock it in place. The 3-section legs do not extend or retract smoothly. You need to push/pull the sections in and out. Unlike my Bogen 3001, the legs extend or retract all by gravity.I expected a little better quality from the Tiffen company. But the sample I got was a disappointment."
4,Very interesting book,I picked this book up to help my son with a school report. I thumbed through the book as he was writing his report. I got sucked into the story of Satchel Paige and it was enough to get me to read the book cover to cover. It is is a very interesting story about a young man who faced many obstacles and pressed onward to make his own success.
2,Bragadoccio,"Satchel Paige was one of the all-time greats, but to hear him tell his own tale is an exercise in hyperbole, leaving the reader wondering just how much can be believed. He makes fantastic claims, such as having thrown 150 no-hitters and apparently striking out 22+ batters more times than he can count during the lengthy time that he played our national past-time. In his stories he always comes out on top, is always the hero and savior of any team on which he plays (and the man played with Josh Gibson), and shows a near zero level of humility. He claims to have been always loved and thought of as the hero by his teammates, which comes off as false considering he would jump ship from team to team regardless of contracts or agreements whenever offered a handful of cash. Certainly a colorful character, Paige was an important player at a tragic time, but his storytelling comes of as self important chest beating."
5,Two thumbs up!,"In many examples of actual consultations, Noel Tyl demonstrates the techniques he uses to relate the horoscope to the life being lived by the client. He shares how he translates astrological measurements into psychological insight, the preparation for the consultation, the observations of the client and how he creatively directs all of this into a powerful session that quickly gets to the point. I highly recommend ""The Creative Astrologer""."
2,"Not for training, just general rabbit information","I got this book from the library before I went out and bought it, and I am happy I did. Our bunny hates being picked up, hates being held, and fears coming near us sometimes (we are his third family). And the book assumes your bunny is tame and loves being held, which most bunnies don't.For example, the training directions for a bunny trance does not start with how to get your bunny into your arms and allow you to turn it over, it starts with the bunny already in your lap, upside down. Hey Patricia Bartlett, if I could get my bunny to stay in my lap, let alone have him stay upside-down in my lap, I would not need your book!If you have a tame, socialized bunny, you can prob train him on your own, and if your bunny needs taming training, this book will not provide it. I liked this book for the general bunny information, but for training purposes, it didn't help us."
4,good for beginners,"This would be a great book for people who have little knowledge of rabbits. It's not so much about training the rabbit, but getting along with your rabbit and keeping him/her happy and healthy. A great bargain for those new to the wonderful world of rabbits!"
3,ok but i've read better,This book is just ok. There are many more things online for free that can help a new rabbit owner. I just got my first rabbit. i researched for months before i adopted mine. This book is good for guide lines but the magazines are much better if you want solid info that you can trust. And the training isnt that helpful!
2,"i loved this movie as a kid , but it really doesn't hold up well","when i was young i loved this movie and can remember watching it. sadly it has not stood the test of time very well. the history of the movie is very far from fact and the whole cast looks like they want to get as far away from the screen as they can. to make it worse the battle scenes are just ok not great like a movie like this needs,and that just makes this all the more a reason to avoid this one."
2,another war flick,"I love tanks....AND this movie showed'em. I like ""good'ole WWII flicks,what do you expect, An acadamy award winning film all th' time?!? I think the sniper scene was tough,especialy the maneuvers they used.....get into war movies,and stop comparing them!!!"
2,Disappointing,"Some great scenery, and a solid cast can't save this clunker of a script. Cheap philosophy and bad dialogue abound. The military ""action"" such as it is, is laughably portrayed. Clearly, no one involved in this production had ever been anywhere near to a battlefield. Oh, and the soundtrack; almost comically bad.Give it a miss."
3,it's ok,the movie arrived quickly but i thought the movie wasnt very good. i enjoy WWII movies but this one was a little too much hollywood.
3,Entertaining + Suspenseful snipering scenes + rushed to ending = Worth watching,"The best thing about this movie is the sniper scene in which 4 out 7 US solders were killed. It's suspenseful, exciting and entertaining. It's also touching when it showed who surrended only to be killed in revenge.What I don't like is the ending. It seemed the director rushed to the ending. Because of that, the film failed to depict the intensity and great suffering of 5,000 Americans and British who were injured and killed in the fighting. It's worth watching once.P.S.The number of 5,000 Americans and British injured and killed at Anzio is quoted from [...]"
3,Pretty interesting for a war movie,"I do not normally watch war movies but found this one to interesting. It made me want to watch to see the ending. The movie made you get involved in the men's lives. I think that Robert Mitchum made a mistake when he said that the 1st and 2nd rangers were almost wiped out, it was the 1st and 3rd rangers. But I don't think it was made to be a historical document. All in all I enjoyed it."
2,Great actors but lousy film,"Let me explain it..How were the GI's carryin Einfield british rifle!!! which is supposed to be an M1 garand! most of the scene and the germans fighting off with em with a BAR!, Cruisers and Destroyers with the Helipad!..panzers arent Tigers or Panthers but they're patton tanks! Imagine poor GI's shooting out with germans with their own weapons!!!! If you are into classic war movie you would notice how bad the movie was shot. I guess they were in Short of movie propsjust to finish te film.. My apology to the Film fanatics. Just see and I dont say i would recommend. peace.."
3,Laws of power and Loss of Values,"I bought this book after reading some of the reviews.I must say it indeed is a good book(and my congratulations to GREENE on that) but do read the title carefully. Its a book about getting powerful , not a book about being a good person or being a good leader also. The 48 laws mentioned here are all crash cource on short lived happiness and so called power. I cant imagine being friends with anyone who spies on me.I cant imagine working for someone who takes all the credits. How smart you might be, but your actions would eventualy reflect your true nature.Then dont expect to retain all the power you gained. But this book does teach you to be careful."
2,Interesting but Repetitive,"Although an interesting and well-written book, the most obvious criticism of the 48 Laws of Power is not that certain principles contradict each other, but that they duplicate each other. Think about it; 48 Laws. That's a nice even number isn't it? Without being as obviously manufactured as 'The 50 Laws of Power' it certainly has a nicer ring to it than say 'the 37 Laws of Power' would. In fact I see no problem in certain Laws contradicting others, much like the highway speed limit is occasionally contradicted by the reality of rush hour traffic. But there is obvious repetition in Laws like ""Always Say less than necessary"" and ""Win thorugh actions, never through argument"". There are other even bettter examples, but unfortunately I do not have the book here with me at present to refer to... I think other readers will agree though."
2,"""Ego-feeding"" - Looks good on the outside...","I must agree with the previous comments. Despite the very delicate cover and layout the book lacks substance.The worst thing about this book is that it makes me sick after a while. I can hear the little voice inside me saying, that I don't want to be a part of the world it projects.1) I don't think that people get happy by persuing power for it's own sake.2) You CAN achieve your goals without hurting or taking advantage of others.Eventually, these ""laws"" will make you a very sad and lonely person. You cannot deceive the world forever. Without being too religious: You might win the world for a while, but lose your soul very quickly."
4,Great But Missing Important laws!,Great book to bring to light some obvious laws of power and some overseen. Looks like the author used the missing law of power which is having professional vocabulary. But the author tells you laws at the start of each chapter then elaborates by going into a story of history explaining the law. But I recommend the book its a good read!
5,The 48 Laws Of Power,"This is a great book , very informitive and in depth. If books of knowledge are for you then this is one book you dont want to miss."
5,the 48 laws,"This book to me is a very interesting collection of material. Before I begin, I think I should mention that this is the first book I have began to read in a while and I have not been able to put it down! I enjoy the relation of transgression and observance of the 48 laws and how they relate to certain occurences in history. My favorite is the law of using absence to increase respect and value to attain power. This is a book that I will try to put to use. In my opinion this is a book that is best understood if it read more than once."
2,Kindle Edition,"I ordered the Kindle edition of this book and it is severely messed up in my opinion. There are many areas where the text is not correct and there are missing characters. I am upset because you have to pay more for the kindle version, and I feel like they ran the paper copy of the book through an OCR without even checking it for any possible errors. It makes the book hard to understand."
1,A five star and a one star for different reasons.,I give this book a one star for the same reasons that many others do...because the information could be dangerous in the minds of people that want power for the wrong reasons. I give it a 5 for the reason that it is a good study on how some of the most evil and manipulative people on earth came to power and how they used it in destructive ways. I read almost all of his books and found them informative for the purpose of defending against these types people that wish to come to power in these types of ways. My impression is that Greene wrote this book and others mainly for the people that wish to have power for all the wrong reasons.
5,A handbook for everyday use,"I have read 48 laws of power so many times , and whenever i read it i find something new , something i missed before.it is one of the best book i have ever read .the laws are superb , even i have applied some in my everyday life like disdain things u cannot have, increase respect with absence and they have worked yes , and more then i expected .i have recommende it to all of friends, faculty, and to my sister . she says its cruel but this is how the world isi strongly recommend this book"
3,"""Could've been titled; Mans Inhumanity To Man""","First let me state: I do not knock this book. The stories, fables and anecdotes are fascinating. The author has outdone himself as an historian. His style is excellent and topics profound. I found it difficult to read the text and subtext (along the books borders & in red letters) simultaneously. My major gripe is that the author made minimal effort in instructing me, the reader, in how to use these laws. I feel that a self help book (if that's what you would call this one), should have more instruction. Other than those two gripes, I loved this book. It is a book which would be better left out of the wrong hands. One of Hitlers favorite books was ""The Prince"". I have to admit, I felt somewhat dirty reading this book. I still found it very interesting, and would recommend it."
5,48 Laws-you choose,"overall a gem of a book. yes there is angles of constant deceit & seeds of manipulation planted, but the book only explains whats happened over time not in todays world. Therefore you can simply choose which laws best suit your character & adapt accordingly. Some laws make excellent reading but would not work in todays world, so basically the book excites the mind into new ideas rather than providing a non-existance gospel of power control. Fascinating insite to lifes constant struggle for superior power."
4,Not for beginners,"This is an excellent book for experienced users of power who wish to further their mastery. However, if you are not already experienced in using power in your everyday life, stay away from this book.These are advanced techniques that will blow up in the faces of power novices. However, once you are comfortable with the exercise of power, this book can be very helpful. There is a lot of information here and it will take several readings to get full value from this text. Not all laws will apply to your situation, but for the ones that do apply, there are a lot of subtlies to be appreciated.Highly recommended for power players."
5,I love it.,"I'm still re-reading this book again, because there's so much information in it to help you navigate people's temperaments and personalities. Overall, I'd suggest everyone over the age of 16 read this book. And please, use these powers for GOOD, not evil."
5,A life changing book,This book was given to me by my brother. He said it would change my life and it did. It is very split up into small parts that make it either very easy or very difficult to read according to your nature. Each law has examples for and against it from historic figures. After reading this book i identified so many behaviors in myself and others. It allowed my to take better control of myself and my relationships.That being said this book requires work. Self improvement is never easy. The way it's divided makes it a long term project. Revisiting it after digesting its insights will surely give perspective to you and the people in your life.
5,A real thought provoker.,"All of us are at least a little deceptive or even manipulative, because this is what makes for bearable social interaction. Some of the laws even made some strange kind of common sense to me. However, the way to power has used quite sinister methods throughout history.Greene discusses taking credit for other people's accomplishments wherever possible as a law of power. I was surprised to read that Thomas Edison took credit for Tesla's and other inventors' ideas. Has all the juvenile literature on Edison been leading us astray on the virtues of Thomas Edison?I found the discussion of envy outstanding. Greene tells us that envy is the sin that no one will admit to. He cautions us to resists parading our successes to avert the envy that others will not show, but will feel and will find ways to undercut our success. He also says that a ""sour grapes"" attitude is not so bad. It helps us avoid envy, by devaluing the success we want, but cannot attain."
5,"One of Two types of ""Power"".","This is an interesting look into one of two types of ""power"" achievable to man: Power over other human beings. However, before one commits to the guidelines laid out in this book, I recommend reading Ayn Rand's ""The Fountainhead"" for a look into a different kind of power."
3,What you actually want to know before buying the Kindle edition.,"My review is based solely on the quality of the Kindle edition. For the most part it is great. There are a few little errors in spacing, spelling, and general format issues. I'd say you get 2 or 3 for each ""law"". The bigger problem is that there are a few spelling errors so egregious that you have no idea what the word is supposed to be. That happens every 3 ""laws"" or so. I gave it 3 stars because these mistakes are annoying enough that they should create a new Kindle edition, but not so bad you'd demand your money back. If you are reading this, these are the types of reviews you should be writing for Kindle books."
1,pitiful,"I'm only seconding what other reviewers have already said, and that's that this is such a pathetic outlook. One gains ""power"" thru whatever means, and then what is there? Quality of life? Yeah, right. Pitiful.This is a textbook for [people] who think it will help them become winners. They'll only get in deeper. They'd be wise to try some other path to fulfillment."
1,Clichés,"Aside from the fact that it is completely immoral, this book is a serie of clichés embellished by an anecdotal view of history at best and flat out fiction at worst."
5,must read.,i'm going to make my kids read it when they turn 14. This is required reading for any adult.
2,A How-To book for being deceptive and manipulative,"While this book is well-written and contains interesting historical references, I rate it low because of its theme. This book basically tells you how to deceive and manipulate people, how to be underhanded and down right evil! This is a study in anti-leadership. This book will not help readers gain power through leadership, trust-building, and credibility, which is what I thought it would be.To its credit, it provides an interesting study in human behavior. It does help one recognize the games others around him/her are playing. It's sad to me that people behave in the ways described in this book."
1,Slick trash.,"Who is this book for? If you are an arrogant guy with a BMW you already know all this--if you are a normal person you won't be able to work these games in any event.The people who praise this book include caveats like ""Of course I would never do this or that"". And if you try to pull this stuff its entirely possible your ""victim"" will have read the book as well.As for the highly praised artwork and layout, I must have a different edition because my copy has more densely packed tiny text than the penal code."
2,Not a legacy I'd want.,"While there are a few interesting things that interested me from a confrontation management aspect (eg: Make the oppponent come to you), most of it is amoral, ruthless, manipulative and just stinky. It's well-written and researched, and I have no doubt a lot of it would work, but then you'd be a powerful, amoral, ruthless, manipulative, stinky person. A very alone and/or unhappy one, probably. We all know a few of them, and in my experience their traits and methods are far more transparent to everyone around them than they think. I'd rather be known as a person who tried to move the world in a positive new direction than exploit its present weaknesses for my own selfish gain."
4,"Good info, but tedious, GET THE ABRIDGED!","It took me forever to finish his book because it was so tedious, but I did get benefit from it. Robert is a historian at heart and uses stories from history to make his points, which would generally be a good thing you would think, but with 4 or 5 characters with French or Japanese names, it was ""tedious"" to try to follow the action.I do now see when people are using various tactics to gain power and I am wiser for the read, but it was an effort.I hate to miss out on goodies an author may have in store for me in most cases, but believe me when I say, ""Get the abridged"" version. This guy just talks way too much to make a point."
5,Essential for some!!!,"You will cherish this book if you like books that open your eyes, that are very politically Incorrect, books that seem to say finally what noone ever had the guts to say, books like ""The Will to Power"", ""Antichrist"", ""Atlas Shrugged"", ""The Fountainhead"", ""Fire in the Minds of Men"", ""Christianity Exposed"", or ""The Illuminati Manifesto""........................"
2,Better books available.,Cannot agree with the attitudes presented. Several friends thought it interesting though. (For some reason they want me to write eight more words about a book I did not like.)
4,Interesting book,"This book teaches you deceptive tactics on how to gain power. It has good historical examples for each law. I found them very interesting. The history helps you undersatnd the laws better and it is short. The book can be hard to undersatnd however. The laws are contradicting. This is not a ""how to book"". Different laws apply to different situations. Overall this book is worth it."
4,"Entertaining, Insightful, and Historical Examples",I was thoroughly entertained by the historical stories that the author used to explain both adherence to his laws and violations of his laws. The chapters are short and well organized to deliver the message in a way that you remember the theme.
5,mastering others to great lenghts,"First of all as many people who have written reviews presume, this is not a buisness book. This is a book about mastery over others in order to make them respect, love and fear you. The 48 Laws of power is a very bold book which is not afraid to state the evil you must commit in order to be powerful, which is very suiting for the topic of power as it deals with leading people on, manipulting people and being only out for yourself in order to gain true power.The laws work to great effect and gives you the abilty to make people see you as powerful within a short time and provides the techniques to dominate any person you wish.This is a brilliant read even if you are not interested in gain power but just wish to observe others at the domination game.It is beautifully written, humorous, totally gripping and the book layout is fantastic. Anyone who is a control freak or wants the respect of others should be without this book"
3,"Useful tips of maneuvering in Machiavellian world, but-","This book contains many useful tips of how to be successful in a Machiavellian world. Robert Greene draws numerous examples from histrory to support/illustrate his ""laws"". As a student of Chinese history, I find this book not very satisfying that many of the stories from Chinese history contains various inaccuracy, from glossly simplying events to distorting facts to fit his agenda. While I am not familiar with the stories drawn from the Renaissance, the French Bourbon monarchies, Al Capone, etc., I have to wonder how much Greene has altered to make his points.In conclusion, Greene does presents Machiavellian wisdom in The 48 Laws of Power, but I have to take him with grains of salt."
1,Worst. Book. Ever.,"If you have no hope of succeeding by doing the right thing well. And if your goal is to screw everyone you deal with, then this is the book for you! The only possible redeeming value (thanks to the people who said it before me, but much better), it might be a good book to read if you want some kind of understanding when dealing with people who fit the description in my first sentence. Only gave it one star because I wasn't allowed to give it less than that."
1,Pure Evil,"A friend of mine wanted me to order this book for them so I did. I didn't know what the book was about when I ordered it. When it arrived I couldn't believe the content! My friend is a co-worker and he and I have talked some about Christianity and the Bible favorably - so I was shocked that he wanted this book. This book goes against everything Christianity teaches. I'm of the opinion that this book comes straight from the pit of hell quite frankly. I can't believe I actually know someone personally who would have anything to do with this book. I will never see this ""friend"" in the same light again nor will I assist him in the future. (The book actually encourages using people, making them work for you while you take the credit! - Pure EVIL!)"
1,Pathetic!,"This book is the biggest piece of crap I have ever read. For a moment I thought it was written by Adolf Hitler or Saddam Hussein.It is very sad that someone would think this way. I almost feel sorry for the guy who wrote it if it were not for the fact that he is spreading this sick sh?! to other people who are probably too sad or depressed to know better.Love yourself, love your family, love your friends, and you will be ok. At least as ok as any of us can be. And if someone tries to mess with you, don't read this book to try and get back at them. Just go on with your life.We are all better than this.Not worth the paper it's printed on.Ismael Martinez"
1,Ouch,"You can buy not four copies but ten for your children so they ""would"" become CEO's ; You ""can"" become the most powerful person but PLEASE KNOW that if you become a CEO, or a powerful person by what this stupid book teaches you - IT'S ALL GONNA BE CRAWLING IN THIN ICE because this book teaches you the wrong way, the idiot way, the uncivilised way how to get where you want to.After all, why don't you ask yourself who this Robert Greene is to teach you how to become powerful? Does he have any qualifications? Did you ever him about him until you were attracted to his lovely book title? NO and we never will because according to what he wrote and adviced us ""the weak"" people what to do - he must be a very sore loser.I mean only a sore loser would feel so insecure and doubtful - to suggest winnings and power strategies in the most cruelest ways."
1,UNDERSTAND THIS!,"There are two opposing forces in the spirit realm. The first is the kingdom of darkness, led by Satan. The second is the kingdom of God, led by the Lord Jesus Christ.When I was formerly a member of the kingdom of darkness, I really enjoyed this book. I ended up in the L.A. County Jail facing two felony charges and fifteen years incarceration. This book WILL help you to wield power... and FAST. This is true. The power that it will give you, HOWEVER, ends in DESTRUCTION.There is a far superior sort of power, which you can gain by becoming a child of God. You accomplish this by accepting JESUS CHRIST into your heart as your savior, and therefore becoming a joint heir with Him. This is the ONLY way to avoid HELL.The 48 Laws of Power is a SATANIC book. By reading it, you are choosing sides. By reading it, you are choosing your eternal destiny.If you would like to join the army of Light, buy yourself a Christian HOLY BIBLE, and trust in JESUS today!Hallelujah to the Lamb of God!"
3,Made up stories,"The book is interesting but most of the stories sound made up to fit the author's point. He even admits in one of the last chapters that when something has happened in the past, you can reinterpret it and insert your own lines (p.397)."
4,better to start out with Greene's War book,"this one is much more diffuse and though much of it is golden and timeless, there's some chaff with the wheat.The design features of these books are tasteless and detract from their integrity.But don't miss Greene. Unless you are very well read there will be much here you must have for your own."
2,"Great book, Kindle edition is tainted with grammatical errors.","The 48 Laws of Power is a magnificent book. However, the Kindle translation has enough grammatical errors to make me regret paying $14 for it."
2,If you want everyone to hate you....read this book!,"If you don't care about anything else in the world but money and getting to the top then read this book. If you don't need friends, co-workers, your family or any of your pets to like you, then this is the book for you.I bought this book under the pretense that this book was a self-help ""how to empower yourself"" type of book. Ya know like a Dyanetics type of book. Boy was I wrong. This book is a one way ticket to ""I'm an Azzholeville."" The book gives more tips on how to get to the top by stepping on people then the Dallas Cowboys cheerleader pyramid.Why would anyone want to live their life being so manipulative? Its like a full time job of back stabbing. Eventually people will become hip to your game and isolate you. So if you read this book and take the advice, I hope you like eating tv dinners alone on holidays."
2,"if these guys know so much, why aren't they powerful ?","Will Rogers said that it is better not to know than to knowsomething that ain't so. If this book is so packed with wisdom thenwhy don't they give us plenty of examples from recent history, or the here and now. I am supposed to employ spies, eh ? Where do I get these spies ? the yellow pages ? A detailed account of corporate espionage would be handy, but instead we'll be told that cows use their sense of smell, and brahmins used ancient texts, and princes uses spies. You swear ? I have to both regal in my own unique way and also conceal my intentions ? No problemo. I'll saw off the Rolls hood ornament and tack weld it to the hood of my pickup truck. Cool. best of both worlds."
2,Don't Waste Your Time/Money/Energy,"Bottom Line: There are 48 laws, and like many of the other reviews have stated, many of them contradict each other. Try to follow the 48 Laws during your everyday work and/or home life. You will drive yourself nuts and appear anything but powerful.You want power? Then write a book that pretends to give the reader something he/she wants, put a red book cover on it, give it a title that will strike that nerve, and watch the sales roll in! Now that's POWER! I ought to know...it worked on me!"
2,Power,"Very poor book, if one used any of these concepts in the modern world I doubt they would work (actually I know they don't work).The author seems to have no idea about the concept of accountability.Mostly unethical, greedy, irresponsible, unaccountable ideas.No modern examples, all from ancient China, Greece, Middle and Renaissance Italy, France, etc.There is not much about the concept of power in this book.Will finish it just to ensure I don't act or behave like any of these exmaples."
1,scripture of a demon,"to be honest, this book is exactly what is wrong with society. This should be the book of how not to live your life. It is written, it seems, with bad intentions. I do not recomend this book."
3,Don't take in too much,"I have owned this book for over a year now and have read most of it. Dont take it too seriously. It will make you think differently. It is designed to entertain your brain with different ideas on how you should percieve people and present yourself. It gets three stars becuase while the ideas and examples used are entertaining this book can get boring and it is quite lengthy. By the time i got to law 24 i skimmed the rest of the book and lost the motivation to read it so carefully as i had the first half. This book is not filled with techniques or more up to date examples of the laws, but mostly history from hundreds of years ago. If you enjoy history then you will enjoy this book.If you want to think differently or entertain new ideas about people and yourself relating to power then you will like this book. If you take this book literal and seriously, people may not like you."
3,"Amusing, but do not take too seriously","This book is a good collection of quotes on power. But do take it with a pinch of salt. As others mentioned, a lot of advice in it is paradoxical. Secondly, look up how a lot of people in the anecdotes came to their end. The majority of them get killed by someone else. Which is not surprising, if you keep striving for power you will be surrounded by rivals. Furthermore you won't be liked much if you follow these rules. But if you're Machiavellan then you will say, ""It is better to be feared than to be loved."""
2,What can you do for you?,"In short, this is a sort of self-help manual for the self-advancer. In summary, some actions are presented to gain the individual power while others are seen to decrease it. As a result, megalomaniacs unite! Get the power you desire to get what you want the way you want to get it.Sure, this approach might not do much for your relationships - but if you're a person who prefers desert island victories and cave domination to social functions then this approach may work well.The only real flaw I see in the book is that the oppressor must live with those who are oppressed. Well, I guess that assumes they're allowed to live.The authors write, ""Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit,"" - Some might call that stealing. It's also referred to as plagiarism. In taking their advice, I was thinking about gaining the power of writing this book myself. I guess all I'd need is a Xerox copy of the text and I'll be taking this down to Kinko's for binding!"
4,"Great book, great stories","The book is a simple, entertaining, and organized reference on some 48 qualities to gain power, if only one is to apply them.I simply enjoyed the stories that this book contained. I don't see how anyone can apply such ""laws"" in their life. I see this book as more of a historical compilation of interesting stories of powerful people rather than a how-to book on achieving power.This book never fails to entertain, and the price is reasonable. I definetly recommend this book!"
4,"With ""POWER"" comes great responsibilty.","I've read about half of this book and so far have been helped in some ways. What this book does is basically make you more aware of the nature of people and their actions. Many of the laws mentioned and explained in this book are things that we as humans consciously or unconsciously already are used to doing in many a situation.This book however if not read with a grain of salt might have the ability to turn a generally decent person into a pompous *ss*ole. But all in all, if you have common sense it can be benifitial in every day life."
5,An In-Depth Study of Demons,"This book is a very good read, and it also has plenty of examples throughout history of power mongers. Once you've identified the problem: some people share, some want to take it all; you can read this for more examples and an in-depth understanding of power itself.Involved, yet thorough. Maybe start with ""Wolf in Sheep's Clothing"" first if you are reading to enlighten yourself in the behavior of others. If you find the practice of a constant need to acquire power as fascinating as a bug under glass, then read to your heart's content.For someone like me who's more of a live and let live (usually!) I found it to be a real eye-opener."
3,The Two Laws He Forgot,"Robert Greene, wonderful man that he is for compiling the other 48 Laws of Power, forgot the last 2 Laws of Power (as his pithy title so amply shows). And I will argue they are the most important laws of all.Law #49: Never buy a book, attend a lecture, or otherwise follow another person's advice on how to ""gain power."" That, by definition, means they have power and you are a peon following their lead.Law #50: No person has all the answers, nor all the power.Cheers,Thomas Fortenberry"
1,A guide on becoming a psychopath,"The book is a huge disappointment. It's a manual on becoming a psychopath, detached and a parasite. It suggests that we should treat everyone as if they were enemies, prey, worthless creatures. The book is full of pathetic rationalisations and rather nave and a bit silly interpretations of historic events and decisions made by people in the past. The rating of the book is really scary and rather misleading. I guess it reflects the state of today's society.Test for Psychopathy[...]"
3,Few questions,"If everybody in the world read this book. What would the world be like? Will integrity remain intact? Imagine this on a worldly level, instead of an individual level."
4,48 Rather engaging angles of human manipulation,"Having read the 48 Laws of Power a few years ago, I find myself only now getting to a review of this captivating, if not evil book. The 48 Laws of Power is a menu of manipulation, strategy and cold-hearted stratagem for dealing with your fellow humans competitively, if not mercilessly. Without a doubt, the 48 Laws each have a crucial point about our emotional and psychological thumbscrews, with historical anecdotes to back them up. While admittedly some laws seem to at times mesh against the grain of another, they are not without thought-provoking (if not disturbing) food for thought."
4,"Engaging, however occasionally contradictory","This book is highly engaging and has some interesting stories, however many of the laws (as mentioned in another report) are quite contradictory.This book calls them ""laws"", laws are unbreakable rules, they are more of general guidelines. The book never tells the fact that people are different and that 1 (or 48) rules cannot be expected to work on all people. One rule mentioned is crush enemies conpletely or they'll seek revenge, not all people are vengeful. Do you ever seek vengence on those who send you spam beyond blocking their email?On the other hand the book, when the book is not condradicting itself, does give excellant stories of how many of history's most powerful attained their stattus and how many who did not heed to the laws met their dimise.All in all the book is good and somewhat insightful. If you've read many other books on attaining power you don't need this one, but if this will be your first then it is worth your money."
5,Real World information,I found this book to be very useful in business and in life. It is reality...yes authors preach win/win etc...but what actually works...what gets one from point A to point B... This book is not well liked by people who already have power...these are the actual secrets to success...I am certainly not in a hurry to enlighten eveyone to the wisdom contained in the these 400 pages...It even explains how to start your own cult..i.e. Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker types to exploit the masses...I certainly would not want my enemies to have the knowledge of this book...This book also presumes that your well educated and able to understand it..this is not light reading...
5,Like a Naked Blade,"A trusting friend recommended it to me (how trusting I only learned after reading the book). I read it. The first reading took 4 days, the I put it aside. The second reading took about 4 weeks, put it aside again. Just finished reading it again, took about half a year. Out of dozens of dear friends, was able to tell only two about the book. The 48 Laws is like a bare gleaming pig-sticker of a blade which you can't just whip out for display in polite company. It is deadly effective stuff, and you may not want it known that you know."
2,"Great Book, Kindle Version has serious editing and proofreading problems","The 48 Laws of Power is a useful book, but the editing and proofreading of the Kindle version of the book is so poor that some portions of the book are cannot be read. They are the written equivalent of gibberish."
4,The first rule of Power is -- you don't talk about Power,"This is what I think about The 48 Laws of Power: The first rule of Power is -- you don't talk about Power. The second rule of Power is -- you don't talk about Power. The third rule of Power is -- aways remember the First Law: Never Outshine the Master. Fourth rule is -- there ARE ways to get others to do all the work for you AND take all the credit (one of the Laws) while still giving the one who performed the work her/his kudos. It helps Protect Your Reputation (another important Law). Fifth rule -- don't forget that The Laws of Power are ""amoral,"" neither moral nor immoral. Sixth rule -- don't forget that although the Laws are amoral, HOW you execute the Laws is not. Seventh rule -- put the book down when you start to feel sick about the corporate world. And the eighth and final rule -- read the book when you start to feel sick about the corporate world."
5,Great service,I will recommend it to all my friends and will also do more business as well over all great job thanks.
3,OK I GUESS,"This book was interesting, but alot of the concepts in this book, I already practice. Much of this information is common sense, some is quite shady, but it's a good book for someone who is vulnerable, or naive to how others may try to manipulate them."
3,"as if author had 40 laws originally, bs'd his way to 48","Some of these tips are nice, but otheres are just plain mean.Power is nothing if you don't have friends.Many of these laws are common sense, and many are impractical to use in real life but sound as if it is your ticket to being CEO of coca cola. also, some laws contracdict themselves, so you have to choose which law to use according to the situation.Read the book, but filter out the practicaly laws and put them to use.A good read, i would pick up the book if its less than 5 bucks."
2,Disappointing,"I had hoped for a psychological or social investigation of power and influence, but this is basically a collection of anecdotal stories that the author tries to group around a central theme or ""law"". Many of these laws are somewhat contradictory, and entirely subject to interpretation. There is really no attempt made to relate the laws to practical situations, and so even if one memorized each law and the related story, it would still be very difficult to discern when to use any particular law in a specific circumstance. As it is, the book is mostly interesting as a collection of historical anecdotes related to leaders, and not in any sense a ""how to""."
1,ms,"Wow, very sad and pathetic book. I recommend this to no one. I found it extremely distrubing and worth not reading more than two pages"
1,To be avoided at all costs,"The most frightening thing about this book is that people actually buy it and try to incorporate these twisted ""laws"" into their lives. Follow even a few of these laws and you will be on your way to being a paranoid, vindictive, manipulative and plain heartless individual. These laws will not help you in any arena and you are encouraged not to support this author and publisher by purchasing this book."
1,"A random collection of bad, poorly told, half-true stories","Apparently the only reason the author chose 48 laws is because it looks good, and the only reason he wrote this book is to make money and condescend to his readers. This book is clearly aimed at the slow people at the lower end of the IQ scale who think they are being smart by reading this book. It has more contradictions in it than the bible. Its ""lessons"" are either repugnantly trite or entirely arbitrary. If the book could be summed up in one word: random. though if your IQ is below 90 you might feel good reading it. The only reason anyone would ever buy this book is to be entertained by the random stories, though obviously the sources used were not very diverse and his writing style is ugly and repetitive. robert greene's guidance counselor back when he was choosing a career should be fired."
1,An Idiots guide to learning power,"this book is absolutely ridiculous, it was written for the idiot's notion of what they believe power is, and just affirms what the dim witted already suspect; ""Use a person until they are no longer valuable to you......"" AH HA! says the ignoramus who has just been convinced of the vercity of this childrens book."
1,For The Weak and the Unethical,"This book is not about spirituality nor it is about psychology.I bought the book yesterday at the recommendation of my partner who was flipping through the pages. I can't describe the disappointment I felt after reading some excerpts from the book. All the human dirt that you can think of is in this book. Do read it folks just to know how low life manipulative people ultimately attain power, thought the stupidity of leaders with no insticts nor wisdom and vision. At least I learned why my boss is such a cunning, manipulative sneaky, ruthless coward. He must have read the book. Oh, how obvious he is. He has no respect what so ever from anyone in the office. If you believe in God you wouldn't able to apply these laws."
1,Great only as a gag gift for an inane egoist.,"I was hoping, as one reviewer suggested, that this could be a work of satire. But then I read further as the author so gallantly defended his work, and reached the sad conclusion that he is, in fact, serious. However, he does not follow his own advice: ""always say less than necessary""."
5,Brainwashing manual - Destined to be a classic.,"I spent the first half of my life being drawn into a variety of schemes, many of them outright cons. I did everything from visiting Guru Maharaji to taking absurdly expensive 'self-improvement' courses. Had I had the understanding this book gives, I might have recognized the classic power plays these modern day con artists were using. The more things change...If you want a detailed, historically fascinating account of the ways humans are, this is an absolute must read. If you have idealistic or utopian leanings, this book might save you a lot of grief."
5,Best book read in the past 5 years!,"This book explains the various laws to follow in order to become powerful. Depending on the level that you want to achieve, apply one, some or all of the 48 laws. Superbly well explained and supported by countless historical examples. This book changed my life! I am not the same person anymore! I have already applied at least 10 of the 48 laws of power! Watch out!"
1,Avoid,"I got a sense from this book that everyone has to compete with everyone. Everyone is an enemy, even your best friends. This sounds like pure Communist ideology to me. This book will not take you anywhere. These ideas will actually ruin your life. Struggle for power will stress the hell out of you. Look what happened to China, Soviet Union, North Korea. Their ideologies are very similar to what was described here.I do not posses very good writing skills, but I decided to warn people. Can you imagine dealing with someone who follows it? This book creates a miserable calculating-monster. What ever is described here is NOT equal to success and power. A good example of POWER is who is truthful, compassionate, and tolerant. This book teaches you nothing about compassion. This book should be called not ""Power"" but ""Misery"". Only a person who is miserable may actually enjoy it. Avoid this book at all costs."
2,It's about. . . how to fail.,"Everytime I have used the ""laws"" in this book, I have lost popularity, success, and friends. Read this book and make sure you do not apply a single priciple to your life. I suspect that the opposite of every non-contradictory rule is a better guide to power.The only merit these ""laws"" have is in the global abstract. If you are running for President of the United States these rules may be somewhat applicable. The reason I say this is because traditional power rules do not apply when one is pursuing power at the impersonal, national level, where there is fierce competition.""Good men are never great. Great men are never good."""
3,48 Laws of Power,"It is only ok. Contains alot of long, boring parallels to historic events to make the writers' points. Some of the ""laws"" contradict others stated in the book. For example - one law says to ""make yourself scarce and mysterious"", while another says ""be everywhere at all times and make friends with everyone""."
3,"5 star to the powerless, 1 star to the powerful","This book is 5 star to those who have been gullible, naive and ignorant of the bad aspects of human nature and all the sudden, have become estastic when they discover about a book which points out the blindingly obvious.This book rates only 1 star to those who knows how dirty the game can get.A word of caution : Nothing loses you power more quickly than the breaking of the trust of those on whom your power rest. If your power rest on those whom you cannot trust; they can easily eat you as you can eat them.You can fool someone some time but you can never fool everyone all the time.You get to the top not by using the 48 Laws; you get there by eliciting the best from people but do expect that many of the dirty tricks of the 48 Laws will be played out against you - which you must know how to neutralise. I know - I managed to arrive to the top. As far as I'm concerned, this book is only good for self-defense."
3,Unusual Book,"A solid read. I wish I would have read this book earlier in my career. It's way too long to just sit and read and and would be better enjoyed to take your time and read one chapter at a time. Let's face it, 48 different laws are a lot of laws. Some advice has to be taken in context and with a grain of salt, and I would not run my life based on these laws. They are interesting observations on human nature and how it was applied throughout history."
2,this book should be read with other literature,"if you are willing to buy and read this book, you should also get Without Conscience: The Disturbing World Of Psychopaths Among Us by Robert D. Hare; Games People Play : The Psychology of Human Relationships by Eric Berne; and The Art Of Worldly Wisdom by Balthazar Gracian"
2,Greene cheats in his writing formula,"I read 48 Laws of Power earlier this year. I was terribly unimpressed with it. Greene is a hack writer who fancies himself as coming up with profundities. Half of what he writes is painfully obvious (""If you want to seduce a woman, try becoming rich and famous!"") and the other half is self-contradictory (""Never depend on others"" and ""Isolation is dangerous."")He acts like he came up with these 48 laws from first principle and then scoured history for examples that prove him right, but all he really did was read a bunch of anecdotes of people who happened to get lucky and then come up with a summary title that makes it seem like what happened was systemic. Sure, if 100 people act suddenly and bold in their quest to overthrow the emperor, one of them will be successful and Greene will write a ""Be sudden and bold"" law about him, but what he doesn't write about are the other 99 that had their heads cut off."
5,"Amazing book, but...","this book is incredible, but also depressing. It presents an accurate portrait of what is required to truly obtain and wield power, but you could also wind up being a wretchedly miserable person if you hew to it too closely.I would recommend that you purchase and read Lama Surya Das' ""Awakening the Buddha Within"" at the same time and find some middle way between the two."
5,The Laws of Power work!,"This book on Power is much like the Prince - you can get power for good or evil.The Prince is a 'how to' book for evil Princes - and if you don't believe me, read your history.One of the best books I read after this one was about the family that Machiavelli consulted for and wrote the Prince for and about, the Borgia's. Its an example of the 48 Laws of PowerCheck it out:Machiavelli's Disciple: The True Story of the Borgia PopeYou will be astounded!"
4,Extremly Interesting Will not get you POWER,"The book provides very interesting historical anecdotes that illustrate the ""laws of power"" as well as the point of view of the author. But let's face it, If this rules would get you so much power, how come the author biographies do not include any senate, CEO or former power positions. At least you would expect these rules to provide the author enough power to work with a better publisher than Viking. So buy it and read it for the interesting history passages and anecdotes contained in the book, unless your idea of power is writing books for a non significant publisher."
2,Snippets In Search of Context,"This book is a useful summary of some aspects of the various philosophers thought. Yet it is often lacking in historical context.A much more practical book for our times-- in which power is rooted in the ability to blunt some messages via media control while at the same time amplify others-- is JFK and the Unspeakable by James W. Douglass. Even Pentagon Papers author Daniel Ellsberg has said that it fundamentally changed his view of the assassination and even more importantly his policies.Yes the 48 laws inform, but often they are laws out of context, when taken out of context from the true medium: bureaucracy. Douglass points out that sometimes this medium can not only distort the message but, as in the case of JFk's Vietnam policy, actually contradict it.JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters"
4,"Some like it, some don't, but it is an interesting book","Tired of getting walked over by colleagues? 48 laws of power is not the type of book that you pick up and read cover to cover, but a resource that you can use from time to time. If office politics is getting you down, 48 laws of power is a great book to assist you in formulating strategies to be slightly more machiavellian. Just temper the advice when you put it into practice!"
4,Too many laws,"This book is OK and interesting, but many laws are just repetitions or just not laws: every field of knowledge cannot have more than 10-15 of them !"
3,FALLS SHORT OF ITS POTENTIAL,"The concept was good. A book exploring power, how it works and the so called laws of power. Unfortunately it might better be called the laws of ancient Chinese secrets. Power is far more reaching than the historical analysis of this book. While looking at ancient Chinese and French antedotes, there is far more to power than those isolated cultures. Some of the Laws are relative today, but the book uses far too many examples of these historical periods and none from today. The book would have much greater impact if the author had looked at more recent examples of power and how it applies to our current world.`"
4,Buy it....if you're ready,"430 pages of historical reviews on the use of techniques which garner power. This book is not for those looking for a ""how-to"" guide. I'm sure there are other books out there which will condense the information contained in this volume. That said, this is the treatise on the subject of interpersonal power. After reading this book you will know how to use power, how to gain it, and, most importantly, why such techniques work. But be prepared to go through hell to get there. Robert Greene has a tendency to be long-winded (I did mention 430 pages did't I?), and his use of allegory, although interesting, forces one to pull the lessons from his stories. This book does not give you the rules, it forces you to learn them. This is both a strength and a weakness of the book. It is the definitive work of this genre, it is also a lot of work to get the most of the book. I highly recommend it, but be prepared for that work."
4,Awesome guide,I have to saw I was skeptical about this book. I bought it on the recommendation of a family member and I'm so hooked. This book is so incredible and truly gives insight on how to live and be successful dealing with others.
3,"Was overwhelmed at first, but now.....","When I first bought this book back in '98 I have to admit, I was captivated. But as I continued reading this book I kept thinking that people were coldblooded and that the world did not need a book like this to encourage people.Now that I am back in the corporate arena (Lion's Den, same s**t), I will be reading this book like any self preservationist would. People go through unsurmountable means to do things to people to get on top. And with television shows like ""Survivor"" breaking records that they have, it goes to show you at what lengths the public will go through to see people claw there way to get what they want. Read the book, draw your own conclusions."
3,"Fun and Informative, but No Guide to Fulfillment","As a voyueristic peek into the minds and lives of the ethically challenged throughout history, the 48 Laws of Power is as entertaining as it gets. However, beyond that, it's only real value, is as a means of categorizing, recognizing, and hopefully thwarting, the tactics of the sleazebags among us. It seems to me that what the authors have given us is an updated and expanded Baltasar Gracian (The Art of Worldly Wisdom), without the charm. It's still a fun read, but one senses a certain shallowness that is not entirely compensated for by the wealth of historical allusions. Enjoy it for what it's worth, but certainly, take it with a (large) grain of salt!"
3,Just So So...,"There's some interesting things in here. Alot of it starts with stories from Medieval times so parts of it can be about as exciting as reading some old testament. The laws themselves seem to make sense, you just have to be creative enought to apply them to your life. There's nothing evil in here, as one reviewer seems to want to suggest. If your good, you'll have good intentions, if your a troublemaker then the book will probably get you into more trouble."
4,Well written and well sourced,"This book is entertaining to read as well as informative. The formalistic approach to each chapter gives it a stylized edge, and Greene plays this up in his writing voice, which keeps the discussion from becoming depressing or inhuman. Some of his laws contradict each other subtly though, it would have been nice to see some discussion of how laws conflict and what that means."
4,a good guide to tough situations,I read this book a lot. Its a constant reminder that there is always a certain way to handle a situation and it should always be to your best interests. I dont think its as machiavellian as some people think it is because its about maximizing any situation so you can look and feel good about it. Expertly written with great historical examples and fun cultural quotes and sayings i thought this book was a moral and history lesson all wrapped up into one.
5,I love this book!!!,"I really enjoy the historical references, the good advice, and the writing style!This is all stuff you have probably heard before but forgotten. To have so much information in one location is invaluable!Even if your goal is not to control or manipulate others, you can use this to be forewarned. I bought this for my Kindle but i intend to get a hatdcopy as well."
4,Great read,Great coffee table book to pickup and read as exerts. Each chapter is a stand alone Law with great examples in History of figure heads outwitting their opponents with discipline and force.
5,Great read,I was lead to this book by a friend and have to say it was an awesome read. The story's are interesting and apply well to each law of power. I would suggest this book to anyone who enjoys history and seeing things through the eyes of some of history's most power individuals.
5,Excellent Book,"Firstly, I read this book when it was released years ago. Then, I was a younger man and like most young men I was naive yet intrigued by the subject. I was a pop consumer reader, less critical of what I read, and often did not ask questions of the author. But, now as I reflect on the book years later, I still feel this book was a very fun read and offers interesting perspectives on the concept of Power. This is not a manual for power but rather an easy entertaining read regarding aspects of influence and manipulation. The format of the book is easy to consume as the sections are short and thus make the book a good nightstand book. Overall, I enjoyed the book very much and recommend it highly to for those looking for looking for entertainment."
4,YouTube Review,"This is a key text in the MS in Business program at Full Sail. After reading five laws, this made me feel great about my program and I recommend it to any one interested in business. However, take the advice that applies to you, this text is so powerful it could destroy someone or the world if taken too far.Here's a link to see how it's used at my school Full Sail [...]"
3,48 Power,"This book really surprised me,I didnt think to highly of it at first, but it's a really good book."
2,"Mildly entertaining, but base and immoral.","While I did enjoy the historical anecdotes for their own sake, I personally found this book more useful as a defensive tool."
5,If you like brewing and building stuff....,"As an avid home brewer and builder of ""stuff"" , this book is brilliant . Already it has saved me $200 Australian dollars ( i built a jockey box using the ideas in this book ). The book has heaps of good ideas on easy things to do and build for home brewing, but more importantly , it also goes into the ins and outs of some more involved things such as how to cultivate your own yeast for home brew. Everything has easy to follow diagrams and explanations and even the most amatuer of DIY persons could do some or all of the suggestions the guys make . Overall a very good book to own !"
2,Simple Clear - but info is avaible in other places ?,"This book does a great job describing the mechanical part of homebrewing. It's well written and well illustrated, but is it useful? Most of this information is avaible somewhere online - in home brew forums - drawings and all - For Free. It's a good book - but it was origninally written in 1961 !! My reprint is from 1996 - `96 is the begining of the internet - when you still had to buy books to get most info.? Simple research on the internet will save you some money."
3,Could use improvement,Good book for the beginner but leaves a lot to be desired for more advanced equipment. Still a good book to have in your library.
4,Approachable,Great tips and gear ideas for brewers of all levels. Easy to read and enjoyable. Doesn't really go beyond any other guide though.
2,excellent but obsolete,"this was written before the internet, the majority of information in this book is available online or in basic brewing books, the gadgets described are mostly widely manufactured and / or easily available."
2,Outdated & not all that useful,"I'm sure this book was tremendously useful when it was published in the mid-90's, but a lot has happened since then. Not only has brewing technology changed and advanced, but the internet means that all the information contained in this book (and more) can be found elsewhere. Even without the internet, your local home-brew shop will have equipment that surpasses everything detailed in this book. Don't bother with this book!"
3,"Good, but not great.","I recommend this book as a collection of plans and details you can generally find in many other places. However, most of the information is available for free elsewhere.If you are just getting started brewing, this book might save you a little money in giving you the basics of how to build your own equipment, but a caveat to that is that you should also subscribe to a good online brewer's forum."
2,Waste of time!,I was really excited to get this book. I figured it would have all kinds of projects. There is nothing in this book that your average handyman couldn't make off the top of your head. I should have looked at it before I got it. Waste of money!
3,Just can't bring myself to buy it,"I can't tell you how many times I've picked this book up with the intention of buying it. I've ended up putting it back on the shelf every time. Reason? There simply isn't enough content of value. First, a lot of it is simply obvious. Second, a lot of it is available elsewhere. Third, it's simplistic. Fourth, it's irritating that that it includes commercially-made items (i.e., not everything is about home-made items, in spite of the title). Finally, it's just not that well written. I've read it through standing in the bookstore a dozen times. I guess I think I'll find something I've missed. I never do ...Buy it only if you're absolutely strapped, are just starting out, and really don't know where to begin."
2,pretty basic,"if you're the kind of person who doesn't know what way to turn a screwdriver you'll probably think this is a great book. if you're the kind of person who's even moderately handy it's pretty much going to be a bore. as was said before, the information is now widely available on the internet, available for a reasonable price or is just common sense. if you already have a solid homebrewing library, you're not going to find much in here that interests you."
4,Like it a lot,I've been enjoying this product for months. The only drawback is that it doesn't have anyway to stay in place - would be great if it had a strap or something else to keep it in place.
5,"An excellent book about people, ethnicity, and nationalism","As a Greek-American whose grandfather and grandmother were born in Proussa, Asia Minor (modern day Bursa), I read this book with great interest. It made me feel fortunate to be born in the U.S., with old world hatreds left behind. And it was great reading a Greek book where the Turks weren't described as barbarians. In fact, many of the Greek generals and political leaders came across as the real villains and buffoons. The book teaches and reminds us that people usually get along, at least until nationalism and patriotism get in the way. A great book to read, especially with the Kosovo and Bosnia and Congo in the background."
1,Smells like PineSol Cleaner - my 2 cats HATE IT!,"I bought Natures Miracle Odor Control Clumping Cat Litter. My two cats refused to get into the litter box.These are two cats that have NEVER had litter-box issues before. I thought I would switch because I heard bad things about the clumping clay litter.While I am concerned about my cat's health, cleaning cat feces and urine off my hardwood floors was not fun at all. I have had to clean my floor at least 10 times a day since trying to make the switch to this litter.I give up - my cats refuse to get near this stuff.I tried everything imaginable; using a small about with their regular litter first; everything.I wasted $13.24 as I bought this at Petco on 12/22 and have now had to throw the rest of the bag away."
3,Strong Scent,"Note that this product has a strong fragrance. If this is not your thing, try World's Best litter. I find that it clumps a little better too."
4,Really Excellent Cat Litter,"I like this litter so much that I began ordering it from Amazon when I could not find it stocked locally. It's not nearly as fluffy and lightweight as some other natural litters, and I think that extra heft helps with litter tracking. My extremely fastidious OCD cat will still kick this out of the box and track it a little, but not as much as other brands we've tried. The smell is pleasant and cedar-ish, and there's minimal dust. Controls odor and clumps very well."
2,"Clumps, but smells and tracks.","Clumps hard enough for scooping, but there is little to no odor coverage. My cat is long-haired and this stuff is ALWAYS caught in his fur and feet. I have to clean him and sweep the floors after every use-- it's very lightweight and flaky, I assume this is why it's always in his fur."
1,Clumping and Odor control?!? hahahahah,"How did I think I'd get away with a bag of litter that big, at that price, and be able to carry it myself?Oh boy I am paying for that mistake. Clumping and odor control? Really, I think those claims are a stretch. At the very least I thought because it is more like flakes that it wouldn't get caught up in her paws, aka not track as much...wrong wrong wrong. Smells bad, doesn't clump, and tracks all over the place. FAIL."
4,Great for odor.,"After 18 years, I think I've finally found a system that control my cat's litter box odor. I use either this product andArm & Hammer Super Scoop Clumping Litter, Unscented, 14-Poundabout 1:1, or the arm and hammer essentials litter and super scoop. Both work great for odor control, and the super scoop helps with clumping and tones down the ""corn"" smell.Visiting family have actually asked if I still have my cat, which I find encouraging. I also notice no smell on entering the apartment, and that's my litmus test."
5,awesome litter for my dust sensitive old lady cat,"i did a little research and decided to give this litter a try...my 14 year old cat is very sensitive to dust and sneezes all the time...i figured i'd buy a small bag and give it a try...2 months later i'm ordering the bigger bag...this litter is fantastic...doesn't smell, clumps up nicely, the cat loves it, the boyfriend loves it...i'd rather pay the extra money to have it shipped to me rather than settle for something of lesser quality!"
1,Doesn't work,"This started smelling like pee within a week, I used a whole 18 lb bag for the litter box for my two cats. The pee will clump but it falls apart easily. Sometimes you can smell pee in my apartment and especially whenever my cats use the bathroom it really smells like pee and so will they for a little while. Before I tried the Wheat litter, I think it is called Swheat Scoop or something and that one is better but it still didn't work good enough for me.I won't be buying this again."
1,wrong shipping weight,the shipping weight is 9.8 pounds and the weight written here is 7.2 pounds.why on earth do you give false information?
4,Baroque Bandshell Music,"Not a ripple of musical profundity disturbs the surface of this program of 18th C 'sinfonie'. If the Boston Pops abandoned their modern horns and strings to perform on ""original instruments"" in the Piazza of San Marco, this is the program they might select. I'm tempted to chide Fabio Biondi and Europa Galante for offering such a brief concert of such jolly bagatelles, when so much vastly more challenging music by the same composers is still unavailable. Did they expect somehow to tap into the CD racks of Wal-Mart and make a killing?On the other hand, these five sinfonie are extremely well-composed and artful in their superficiality, especially the ""house of the devil"" by Luigi Boccherini. And Europa Galante is surely the most masterful Italian Baroque ensemble since the Italian Baroque, so the music is much better played than it deserves. For that reason, I'm stamping four stars of approval on the disk, so long as the buyer is forewarned about what she/he will be hearing."
5,"Voila, voila!",A great read for adrenaline junkies or anyone who wants to vicariously experience the rush of base jumping. Jevto gives a fascinating explanation of what compelled him and other base jumpers to become full-fledged members of this exclusive club.
5,Best BASE book yet written!,"BASE 66 is by far the best account of BASE jumping yet published.I've read pretty much everything written about BASE jumping. Heck, I've written a good deal of it.I make several BASE jumps every week, and I still found my pulse accelerating when reading Jevto Dedijer's accounts of jumps in the 80's. He accurately captures the excitement, the feelings, the comradery, and the sense of adventure that still permeate the sport today.If you are a BASE jumper, you must read this book. If you are not, you ought to read it anyway. I've made it required reading in the BASE jumping (for non jumpers) course I teach at the College of Southern Idaho. I also recommend it to my BASE jumping students.- Tom Aiello, BASE 579"
5,CAPTIVANT QUE CE LIVRE!!!,"D'une grande originalité, ce livre nous offre toute une panoplie de sensation.À lire absolument!!!"
5,Thrilling all the way through!,"BASE jumping is captivating as a phenomenon, and so is this book - you will find it hard to put down, and will probably read it through in just a day or two. Telling the tale of three friends traveling across Europe, teaching themselves BASE jumping by trial and error, the author makes you believe you are right there with them. Even though many of the tales in the book seems downright crazy, you get a deeper understanding of why some people want to throw themselves off Buildings, Antennas, Structures and Earth. Even if you wouldn't dream of doing this yourself, I'm sure this book will thrill and entertain you."
5,Excellent Book,"I ordered this book because I had an interest in BASE. All I can say is: ""Well Done Jevto."" This book gives you an up close view on BASE jumping. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in BASE, or anyone looking for a (true story) adventure book. Again.. Good job!!"
3,It was an okay read at best,"It had the potential to be a really good story, but sorta of fell short and lacked credibility with some of the key characters and circumstances."
4,"BOTTOM LINE: Technically sound book, I recommend this one.","This book has a few errors, but not bad for a first printing. The content is right on and relevent to the exam. I passed the exam using this book as my only reference material."
4,Good for testers,"I found the book to be a good exam reference. Unattended installations are really nailed as is troubleshooting. However, the coverage of RAS is cursory and network monitoring was not even included in the topics.It is best suited for test takers alone so I would have reservations for anyone buying it as a blanket reference guide for NT WKSN."
5,Great Collection,A very well put together episodes of the most popular children shows. I wish PBS would do this as well seeing as how Nick Jr. and PBS have the most popular children's shows on TV today. Was very glad Sponge Bob was not included as it teaches children very nasty habits.
3,Supply Managemetn Handbook,The book took forever to be delivered to my house. I had to use my classmate book to copy the chapters for the assigment that was due that week. I was not happy as to how long it took to deliver the book.
2,Most images are disgustiing trash.,"Out of 90 images only 35 (5 are very good, other 30 so so)are acceptible for me. The remaining 55 are disgusting.I respect those fetish. But I don't want to *see* them pissing on bed. Inside the book there even is a pic of an old man (the pic only took his head and breast) standing like a wood staring. It's meaningless and it' so annoying. I can only say that the editor want to prove he is tasteful and thoughtful by choosing so manny (*2/3*) disgusting/ugly photos here. However, it's not my taste and I hate those ""thoughtful"" critics--those parasites."
4,Very good strings!!!,Very good guitar strings!!!I've used too many others strings but this is the best I've ever usedI've used them before and I will always purchase the same....Very good sound and tasteThank you
2,Not one of the great ones,"I've heard that A.C. didn't believe Poirot fit well into this book, and I would have to agree. I might have liked this novel more if he hadn't been in it, but I doubt it. I'm a huge Poirot fan, and have loved most every other novel he was in, but this book was beyond ludicrous. The plot was ill paced, and by a quarter of the way through the book, when her weak and whiny characters were still being introduced, I was more than ready to set this book down. Much too predictable for one of Christie's stories. The play from this story does not feature Poirot, the book shouldn't have either."
2,I HATE this book,"Christie experiments a lot, I admit that.But the final was disappointing.Why idolize John? He was a selfish guy and an adulterer.Good riddance, I'd say. No wonder he got killed.Poor Gerda.. requiescat in pace."
4,"""The Hollow"" Review",This book was in mint condition and quite reasonably priced. I would buy from this dealer again.
4,Well-written murder mystery,"""The Hollow"" is certainly one of Agatha Christie's finest books. While not quite on the level with masterpieces like ""And Then there were None"" and the like, this book has some remarkably good character development which keep the plot moving at a fast pace. Rather than bland caricatures, Christie has created several extremely fascinating characters in this novel. Although Christie has stated that Poirot did not fit well into the story (as with ""Sad Cypress""), he actually solves the mystery with remarkable finesse. The solution is not entirely anticipated, which makes for a good read."
4,"Good Story, Okay Ending","I thought the characters were great and seemed very real to me. The ending was a little weird to me though, I didn't really get it. I thought the story was great, one of the best of Christies."
4,"Christie in Familiar, Comfortable Territory","The Hollow is a typical example of Agatha Christie's manor house mysteries, full of rich eccentrics, poor relations, loyal servants, and out-of-place neighbours (including, of course, Hercule Poirot). It is not a great puzzler but it is a pleasure. Lady Angkatell is one of the best eccentrics that Christie ever created and she criss-crosses the story in her zany manner, keeping the mystery light. This novel belongs in the mid-range of Christie mysteries as it lacks truly bizarre red herrings or an ending so impossible it almost charms. This is a straight forward story but the author still has fun putting her touchingly stock characters through their appropriate paces."
3,"Very good, but....","OOh, this is actually a very good book to read. I have to agree with some other readers that the book started off very slow. What I like about the book, however, is that Agatha Christie used a very different approach to write this particular piece of work. Nice job.Hercule Poirot actually isnt the spot light in the story. You will not find the usual Hercule Poirot, who like to use his ""grey cell"" to put the crime scene back together. If you are looking for a typical Poirot's advanture, you'll be disappointed. =)"
3,Did Not Love The Ending,"The murder itself was interesting, but the rest of the book was not. I am sorry to say that some of the characters were even a bit annoying. Once the murder takes place, the rest of the book has a dreary overtone. In my opinion the ending was a bit of a disappointment and was somewhat sad. However, the story was set up in such a way that the ending had to be gloomy no matter the outcome. For me, reading this book was not as exciting as I feel other Christie books have been. I prefer happier endings even in murder mysteries."
2,Disappointing,"Initially, I bought the Transforming DVD & loved it, so I bought this one to add variety to my workout routine. This one didn't seem to raise my heart rate as high as the other one. I suppose it provides an ok workout in a pinch."
2,Not enough innovation,"I purchased a couple of the videos in this series, including this one. I have to say I was thoroughly disappointed in all of them. There wasn't much ""new"" here to keep me interested, and I found I was pretty bored. Each of the 30-minute workouts themselves are pretty intense, and definitely get your muscles burning, but the instructors do not break down any of the moves before they do them, and I found it difficult to figure out what they were going to do next. With practice, I guess this might get better. And the three 5-minute ""mini-workouts"" for abs, legs, and arms were good, but not long enough to really feel much of anything. As soon as I started to get into them, they were over! Again, I guess it might help to do these every day or something. However, I can't seem to get myself to do these DVDs - there's just not enough excitement or innovation here to keep me interested!"
3,decent moderate level workout,"This workout is OK. It's moderately difficult, but not quite challenging enough for me. I prefer the Cindy Crawford New Dimension workout. It has two beginner level workouts, then a 40 minute workout. That 40 minute workout better works your body than this Shape workout. This one employs various muscle groups, but does not very thoroughly work them out. If you are at a more advanced level, you might not find this workout enough of a challenge."
2,Disappointed,"This is my first Shape DVD, and I won't be buying another. The workout seemed old-school, with the usual stomping around and resistance moves. Program 2 is a rehash of Program 1, and you will not be cross-training if you alternate them. Also, I have some arthritis in my hands, and wrapping the resistance band around them & pulling was uncomfortable.I bought this DVD partly because Lisa Wheeler was on it. I'm a big fan, having done her workouts with The Method. I also notice that she's Denise Austin's choreographer for her newer workouts, and I love them. As usual, she (and the other instructors) did a great job of demonstrating & cueing. I just didn't like the workout.Update: The second time I used the band included with this dvd, it snapped apart in 2 pieces in my hands. Fortunately it didn't hit me, but be warned!"
5,Great intense workout for days when you're pressed for time,"These are both great intense short (30 min.) workouts for days when you are pressed for time. They are good for the intermediate level, but a beginner could do the modifications (which they show throughout the video). Even though I'm in reasonably good shape, these workouts make me sweat. When I'm feeling like I need something harder, I use heavier weights.Yes, as some people say, the ""inspirational' comments can be annoying, as are the cheery reminders that ""Shape gives you that something extra!"" But despite this, despite the fact that my teenager rolls his eyes every time I drag out this video, I find myself using it often because it's effective."
2,"Confusing camera angles, bad music, and poor instruction","I prefer doing workout videos to going to the gym, but this one is not really worth the 18 bucks. The incredibly fast pace, confusing camera angles, poor instruction, and bad music combine to give a dissatisfying workout. It moves so quickly with so little explanation that a novice could easily injure themselves. Also, there are 3 express workouts on this video that target either your arms, legs, or abs. I've only done the abs one, but it was totally ridiculous and only 5 minutes long. At one point they have you rolling around on the floor, not a viable option on the tile in my living room...that's why you use a mat: to stay on it! I would say try a Kathy Smith video...she puts together challenging, safe workouts that make sense."
2,Not as advertised,"I purchased this DVD after reading numerous reviews stating how challenging it was. However, I would describe this video as old and tired. It looks like it was filmed at least 10 years ago. I'm not sure if this workout was designed for older viewers, but it looks and feels that way. I finished this workout without having broken a sweat -- but all three ladies (40+) looked like they had just come in from a rainstorm. The cardio involves a lot of hopping around -- very hard on your joints -- without being very challenging. The first workout is billed as interval and strength training, but hardly calls for you to pick up a weight. Save your money and look for a good cardio-pilates video -- like one with Ellen Barrett."
4,We Say It Without Words,"I found this book to be interesting, easy reading and thought provoking.Realizing that body language is important, and to be able to ""read"" it, is one of the best people skills a person can develop. Whether you are the office manager, or a clerk in a store, by reading the body language of co-workers, or customers, can give you the advantage in most situations.The reader takes a pre-test, and without looking up the answers, studies the book. At the end a post-test is taken and then the answers are compared. I was amazed at the improvement. I wouldn't recommend doing the entire book at once. Take 1 or 2 sections and apply them before going on.I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more to the book. The exercises were good, I just felt like there should have been a lecture to go with it, to re-enforce what the book said.Overall, this would be a good workbook for staff training."
1,Very disappointing,"I could only get through about twenty-four minutes of this movie- it was so badly written. The two children/teenagers in the film were incredibly rude and obnoxious. They spoke and behaved nothing like what one would expect of a nineteenth century child, even a rude one. Shooting Winslow Homer with a slingshot, insulting and making fun of him, barging into his home without permission and in his presence- I guess it was supposed to be funny but it was just annoying and absurd. I couldn't keep watching. There was very little of the artist working on his art from what I saw, other than a moment or two of him sketching before he was harassed by the boy with the slingshot. On the bright side the sets were great and the scenery looked much like his paintings. It's just too bad the characters were straight out of a bad contemporary sitcom."
4,"Fun, gritty swamp rock/blues","Incredibly talented musicians play a great set mixing southern rock, blues and other influences."
4,A rockin' lil' record!,This record is so honest. It's a rock record made by the sons of legendary Memphis producer Jim Dickinson and it's steeped in North Mississippi blues. There is a standard repetoire of Mississippi hill country blues (see RL Burnside and Otha Turner) and these guys tackle it with the enthusiasm of youth combined with deep respect. For fans of the Allman Brothers certainly. And fans of Fred McDowell too.
3,"good CD, not great","I find myself reminded more of the Grateful Dead than anything else when listening to this cd, not to say it is dead music, just that it is alot mellower than I anticipated.It is still an all-around good cd, no stand out tracks, but all are very good. From listening to the cd one gets the feeling that these guys could definetly do some great jams(once again that Grateful Dead vibe). I really like the cd, but I can't call it great. The Dead fan in me likes this a lot more than the blues fan"
2,"sounds forced, then desperate, ultimately boring","Oh, I was hoping for the best here, but they try so hard to come off as energetic it soon begins to sound forced, and then desperate, ultimately boring. Like Jon Spencer without personality. There's very very little alteration of tempo -- the drummer seems like he's playing the same beat every song. And they don't have anything even close to a distinctive or interesting singer. They might make a great back-up band, though."
5,jam band fan,"This is probably the best studio album to hit the jam band scene in a long time. While it's evident that these boys know how to play hard core Mississippi Hill Country Blues, they are not afraid to expand on these songs of their heroes and breathe new life into this genre of music. A sell out they are not. NO cuts from this CD are radio ready, head candy, pop tunes full of nothingness that American pop music has become today. They are playing wonderful music to the best fans around. Can't wait to see them open for Widespread Panic in Memphis this November. Get the CD, see them live, or both. You'll see what I mean. Chris Chew for President."
5,BUY THIS DISC IF...,"Buy this disc if you like R.L. Burnside, the Allman Bros, or Robert Johnson. You won't be disappointed! This is a real, rough-yet-polished, rockin' blues sound. Sparse, 3-piece sound. Slide guitar, authentic vocals. Great stuff!"
2,Irritatingly postmodern,"I don't think these guys are trying to be ""authentic,"" nor do I think they've achieved an update of the blues, or a synthesis of it with something else. The blues here is just a shell divorced its essence, a simulacra - one style among a myriad of styles available as means to some ambiguous artistic end. Unlike, say, The Allman Brothers, who managed to integrate the blues with other things, hide the seams, and retain its identifying pathos, the music on this record sounds like an awkward, attempted hybrid. I can imagine frat guys from Ole Miss thinking it's really down home and gutbucket though."
3,stick with the original,"Maybe I expected too much from this cd. The covers are ok, but not as good as the original sound. Allman Brothers are much better."
2,I don't get it either.,"I really wanted to give these guys a chance since I have read such glowing articles about them so I picked this one up. I just don't get it. Yes, some of the guitar work shows musical talent, but that's about it. I think the vocals are terrible with absolutely no soul whatsoever. I also agree with the first reviewer that the drummer plays the same thing on almost every song. Yes, I know, the blues by nature builds itself on repetitive musical themes, but a real blues artist puts out so much raw emotion that the repeitive side of the music never gets boring. these guys just don't have that emotion at all. It's all production and no substance and it gets old really fast."
1,What a waste!,"What a waste of time, money and energy. This is some of the most boring blues I have ever heard. Its repetetive, unimaginative, sophomoric. Not one song held my interest to the end. Look for something else. Go back to the roots. Don't waste your time with this derivative drivel"
1,disturbing dissapointment,"Introduce the Spin Doctors to your favorite blues records and, in your worst nightmare, they'll produce this music. If you're lucky, you'll wake up before you have to listen to this whole album. If you were suckered into bying this album, throw out the case, flip over the cd, and use it as a drink coaster. If this is the future of blues, the genre should be changed to ""jams"" or ""runs"". That way, when you hear it, you can say you have the runs and people will know what you mean. Get these guys out of my site."
5,I love this series,"I had the first of Librarian movie and just had to have the others, I put it it off for months and finally ordered it and it's great."
4,THE LIBRARIAN RETURN TO KING SOLMONS MINES,I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS FILM I REALLY LIKED THE FILM AND SERVICE WAS VERY GOOD
3,Save the World,A librarian must master the Dewey Decimal System. The lead gets a job as a librarian. It holds Excalibur and Pandora's Box. The Serpent Brotherhood steals part of the Spear of Desntiny from the library. It was a decent movie that tried to tie itself in with the Arthurian mythos. Worth renting once.
3,Kick Awesome,It was a good movie. I liked it. I thought the first one had more of a story line though.
1,awful sequel,What a letdown. Thought there was going to be some intrigue and more cool special effects. The premise was terrible. King Solomon used an evil force to control his minions? Stupid. The writer and director seemed to have real issues with the old testment story of Solomon. There also was never any real relationship developed between the principle characters this time. On the bright side- the movie came all scratched up but Amazon replaced it quickly with no hassles. Go Amazon!
1,Ridiculously inaccurate,"I understand imbellishing fact for the sake of drama or effect, but there are so many wildly blatant errors with the back-story given to items stored in the ""Library"" that ""suspension of disbelief"" is pretty much impossible when the basic foundation of trust is compromised. Also, the writers/director try a bit too hard to be Indiana Jones-esque. The only perk I found was getting to watch more of Noah Wyle - who, sadly, was more charming with his naivete in the first episode..."
1,returned to amozon as zone 1 dvd waiting for refund,no email to tell me what is going on with my returns all items listed
3,Lots of fun from a light-weight film,"The second in the Librarian series returns with Bob Newheart and Jane Curtain supporting Noah Wyle. These movies may be a poor-man's version of Indiana Jones, but they used every penny with care, especially in the computer generated special effects. Lots of historical and mythical references make it good family fare that might even teach the kids something. Just sit back and have fun."
3,An amusing action and comedy film parody,"You almost have to watch it twice to catch all of the films that are parodied in this one movie. ""Librarian"" is much less scary than the ""Raiders"" series for younger kids to watch and older 'kids' of all ages will find the film entertaining.Some movie-buff friends suggested a fun game to play while watching parodies with friends. Everyone gets a piece of paper and a pen and writes down just how many elements from different films they've seen. The one with the most answers gets a prize of some sort. ""Librarian"" would suit this game amazingly well."
3,Low budget,The movie is entertaining but lacks the depth of a big production movie. I have seen better made for TV movies.
4,For those who want to avoid reading but want their pulp.,"Noah Wyle returns as Flynn Carsen in this Indiana Jones-ish adventure romp this time concerning itself with the lore surrounding the biblical King Solomon's secret buried treasure. Ah, but the real secret is the power that a book-of-the-deadish artifact can give to its controller...that and that this episode gives us more backstory into Flynn's father as a Masonic-ish guardian of the book. This time Carsen's love interest is the flexible Gabrielle Anwar (check her out in USA's superb ""Burn Notice"" TV series) who plays the anthropologist Emily Davenport. Bob Newhart and Jane Curtin return for their brief roles as the Library's head executives and the mystery is furthered as to just who, or what, Newhart's Judson actually is. The special effects aren't anything to write home about but they're better this time around than in the haphazard first entry. Skip the blu-ray as the transfer is extremely poor."
3,Different then the first- QUEST FOR THE SPEAR,"The herion was great... don't no why she wasn't in this one. The story was good as well as acting. The fight scenes are still very cheesy (comic like- no one can shoot straight or fight very well). The special effects were excellent. overall, worth watching more than the first one."
4,Old fashioned adventure in a modern setting,"This is a made for cable movie with production values, performances and overall craftsmanship you would expect from a major studio film. If you like Indy, Lara, and Allan (Jones, Croft, and Quatermain, respectively) you are going to have a great time with this movie!Noah Wyle is more than likeable as the Librarian Flynn Carson, with a great supporting cast including Jane Curtain and Bob Newhart. The story is solidly written and makes for a great night at the movies, especially if you are looking for something kid-friendly but not childish.I also own the first Librarian and can give it the same high marks for quality, originality and class. In short, add it to your collection of high adventure films; it sits nicely with the best of them!"
2,darn,"Well, 2 big disapointments. 1. The actress that played the heroine in the first show is gone and she was terrific for the part. The new one doesn't have nearly the interest. 2. They've put in a somewhat obvious bedroom scene, which made it uncomfortable for us because of our kids, who loved the first movie. It was not necessary to the plot and ruined it as an appropriate family show. Boo Hiss."
4,Wylie's Back,"This was not quite as good as the first. I was disappointed that all the characters didn't return. However, the story had good twists and turns. Redeeming itsself in the end. All in all a movie I can enjoy again and again."
5,Too Funny,"I love this movie, I have the first one too. I saw them on TNT, and I was so glad when they put them on DVD. I had my Dad watch them, and he loved them too, they are just too funny. And who hates Noah Wyle. :)"
4,Chilling and sad,"I casually started watching this movie while surfing channels late one night. It has haunted me ever since. John Hurt gives a sublimely poignant performance as the daft and credulous tenant, and Richard Attenborough is absolutely terrifying (and nearly unrecognizable) as the innocuous-seeming but murderous landlord. This is a quiet movie that creeps up on you and wraps its cold fingers around your neck."
4,Murder most foul.,"Richard Attenborough deserved an oscar for his portrayal of mass murderer Christie. The scenes are haunting and made yet more gruesome by the ever present offer of a cup of tea with which Christie sought to put his victims off their guard. The movie is roughly based on the book by Ludovic Kennedy with some shortcutting. For example, Miss Edie was not Christie's first victim and he did not invariably use a gas contraption to make the women unconscious. A couple of more recent books have argued that lodger Timothy Evans knew more about the murder of his wife and baby than he admitted. He is rather sympathetically portrayed in the movie."
5,Excellent movie!,This is one of my favorite movies. It was well-made and full of chilling suspense. It's hard to believe it's not a fiction movie. The fact that the story really happened makes it an excellent and tragic story. END
5,very underrated.,"Attenborough is probably the most underrated psycho in this creepy, understated, tense, appalling thriller. He reminds me of a gigantic baby with that bald round head of his. This movie will augment your respect for Attenborough and Fleischer."
5,Good Movie,"If you like suspense, you'll love this movie. Saw it years ago and remembered how good it was, so wanted to own a copy. A real life serial killer story."
2,"A book for new agers, not for Christians","I'm not a professional critic, but know what makes for good reading. This is less a book on synchronicities and intuition and more of a chronical of new age guidance counselor experiences. Much effort is made to convince Christians that past life experiences should be embraced. The catchy title and no reviews lead me to purchase the book, but reading it was a waste of time."
1,Horrible Product,"This is really a horrible system. I got it out of the box, hooked it up and turned it on to nothing but static. I checked all four channels, the locations of the system, everything that I could think of, and nothing helped. The product claims to be good throughout a house, through walls, etc. but I couldn't even get it to work across one room. The company is making very dangerous unsubstantiated claims, and it's rediculous how poor this product is. If I turned my stereo all the way up, I could get a faint signal of the audio below the deafening static, but nothing close to usable. This product is currently being returned, and I will not be buying another product for Terk any time soon. Save yourself the hastle and avoid this product."
1,$$$$$$$$$$$$,"This works about 40% of the time. And if you want to spend 15mins on the phone waitng to find out that you do not have the cords. And you have no wireless internet, then this is for you!"
2,Had to return this to Amazon,I actually had to call up the maker of this product for assistant. The first rep was not willing to help so I called back and got another rep to help. Then I had to return the item because my modem and my cordless phones were interfering with the signal. The rep said it is often the case with this item. So it was a no brainer. The phone and modem stayes and the procuct was sent back.
3,average product,This thing gets a lot of interference. Some days none of the four selectable frequencies is usable. I also have to unplug my cordless phone every time I use it also.
1,It Didn't Work,"I purchased the the Terk LF30-RX add-on to work with a Terk LF-30S System I purchased about 5 years ago. On the surface the two are supposed to be compatible as they opperate on the same frequencies. How ever I was never able to get the either of two add-on units, purchased from different retailers, to communicate with my older system. I spent a half an hour with a Terk technician with no resolution. I would not recommend getting this unit to work with an older base unit."
1,"New version is NOT compatible, although model # is the same","What I got doesn't look like the picture on the product page and it didn't work with my Leapfrog system when I tried it. I returned it for replacement, thinking it was defective. However, the replacement Amazon sent me doesn't work either and I'm returning it, too. The new version just isn't compatible; not only doesn't it look like the old one, neither the unit nor the box mentions ""Leapfrog"" anymore and the receiver doesn't work with the Leapfrog system. Even though the model numbers are the same, something is different! When I looked this morning someone else just reported the same issue, so it's not just my setup."
5,Terk Wireless system,This is one of several units I have purchase. I recently built a new home and put over 1500 Feet of structial wiring in. Terk has made it all useless. The units perform better then I could have ever expected.
3,Works but some noise,Unit works going from downstairs to upstairs but there is noise introduced on the screen that I have not been able to isolate.I would not purchase another.DVG
1,Great Idea but.....,I ordered this item under the impession it would work like all my other wireless devices. The concept is great but the interference is unbearable.
3,No what I expected.,"No good signal. Weak. I had one already in other TV. When I put the new one a few foot away, the signal was weak."
3,SoSo,"I bought this receiver to go along with my existing Leap Frog wireless A/V system....I put one in the kitchen and it worked well with the old base receiver...Then I added one in my husbands hobby room and it just didn't pick up a signal at all, so I changed it out with the old one (which pics up fine) and put this one in our bedroom which was a lot closer to the receiver...It just does not operate well over 25 feet.."
1,Snakes in the Grass?,"As one who was booed, cursed, shunned and arrested along with ILGO it pains me to see Anne attack her old friends and fellow activists in this book. People always have their own accounts, but having been there in the early years I'm just horrified. The enemy was hatred and bigotry, the Hibernians, the Catholic Church, perhaps the police and the city, not others in the gay community or the inner circle of ILGO.Take this account with more than a grain of salt, folks."
5,Great,If you enjoyed the Horatio Hornblower movies on A&E you will enjoy the books more. A must have for the Hornblower fans.
5,Great Story,You are right there with Horatio in all his battles and adventures. I really enjoyed this book and all the others in the series.
4,Typical Hornblower Adventure,If you like sea novels and if you like the Hornblower series then you'll like this book. It's typical Hornblower and invokes thoughts of a long gone age of adventure on the high seas.
5,Twelve Books - Same Review,"Volumes I through XII get the same top notch review. I'm a retired Navy man who likes a good ""sea story."" Weave these stories into the history of the British Navy during the Napoleanic Era and the books become that much better. C. S. Forester is every bit as good a story teller as his reputation states.I could not find 3 of the volumes on Kindle. I had to buy paperback."
4,Best yet,"This book shows a lot into Hornblower's more than the earlier books in the series. It shows his ability to think and act strategically and you feel his faults as well. Horatio's growth as a seaman and a person grows considerably in this book. Being a Captain is good for Hornblower. Enough said, read the book."
2,Full price for quarter book,"OK, Hornblower is an alltime classic hero. However, since Mr. Forester died before finishing this book, why are we expected to pay the same as one of his other complete adventures for the start of one along with the notes of how it should end up?Yes they threw a little end of Hornblower's career short story in to boot, more of a inside joke by the author than a real adventure. Still, my advice, save your money. On a day off, go to the library or Barnes and Noble and spend 30 minutes reading this tale, don't buy it!"
2,Toby Keith karaoke review,"I was disappointed in this CD. I knew it was a karaoke cd ""in the style of Toby Keith"" so I didn't expect to hear his voice, but I did expect to hear someone singing, not just the background music. I can't remember if it allows you to listen to any of the songs - if so, I should've done that before I ordered (and subsequently returned) the CD."
1,Not what you think it is,Looking for the first time at this cd you would think that it was Toby Keith singing all of his great songs but that is not it at all it is these Karaoke tunes of all his hits. Very Disapointing collection and the ad never told anybody anything How Rude!
1,Disappointed Fan,"Don't buy this CD. It isn't what it appears to be. It is not Toby Keith, it is really a karaoke version of his songs. I was so excited about getting this CD, but when it arrived I was so disappointed."
5,Toby Keith TT-162,"What can I say that hasn't been said about Toby Keith. The man has more talent than anyone. He can write, Sing, he knows how to hold his audiance in the palm of his hand. He knows whats important he says it all with his music. Having all these hits on one CD WOW!!!!!!"
1,Prepare Yourself,"I was shocked when I got a Karaoke CD. The music isn't even up to the original songs. If your 10-year old loves Toby Keith & wants to sing along or pretend to be a star, this may be a fun CD for them. Somehow, when you play the CD, the words are supposed to pop up on your TV. But if you're a Toby Keith fan and were hoping to get all those great songs on one CD, forget it."
1,not Toby Keith,This is not a Toby Keith CD. This is a Karaoke version of his songs. He is not the actual singer on this CD. I would not have ordered it if I had known it was Karaoke. That was not mentioned on any write up.
4,just ordering it,"for those of you above who downrated this cdg, it says right on it ""top tunes karaoke"". just because you can not read does not give you the right to downgrade a product. maybe next time you will read the title and description before making a purchase"
1,Terrible..,"Seller never shipped items, never gave any notice or communicated with me about the items.."
4,NOT THAT BAD BUT COULD BE BETTER,This game is not as good as the other rainbow games rainbow fans beware this games just does not have the story line of the others
4,Nearly all,"A bargain compared to the much more expensive Rosetta Stone or similar products. Berlitz combined 3 separate learning sets in one package. I found this product really helful in preparing for my trip to Sicily, and took the rush hour and travel cd's with me on my trip for additional study. While there was some overlap and repetition, the different approaches were helpful in reinforcing vocabulary in specific situations. Berlitz should have provided the written script along with the CD's, but downloading and printing the materials from their website was almost acceptable. I would recommend this for anyone making a trip to Italy, especially going to areas outside major cities where English is not spoken much. Use a text book to seriously learn the language though."
3,Protects but it's smaller than you'd think,"Bought this to protect our valuable fingers after purchasing a Shun Steel Angled 4-inch Paring Knife. Although this is a 4.5"" model, it very barely fits the 4"" Shun blade -- there's still a little corner of knife sticking out the back, which is somewhat dangerous. As well, it's difficult to open when on the knife. I give it three stars because it does technically do more than having a naked knife in the drawer, but I'd recommend going with a KnifeSafe about an inch larger than your knife based on my limited experience."
1,Doesn't fit my knife,Unfortunately this did not fit my global 4 1/2'' pairing knife. Actually could not find one that fit so I bought a 6'' chef knife guard and cut the excess off in a miter box with a hand saw.
5,Gem Avenue Swarvoski earrings,These were a gift for my granddaughter. She loves them as she always doeswhen I give her Gem Avenue jewelry.
4,Typical Burwell,"This score is dark, moody, and in short is everything you come to expect from a Burwell CD. That being said, it isn't his best. No one came blame him, for this Hamlet certainly isn't the best film. Still it's a good listen, and if you have other CD's of his, you'll want to check it out. If not, you may want to look at maybe his fantastic work on Fargo or Being John Malkovich beforehand, lest you be quite chapfallen."
1,Disappointment,"I also bought the matching brush, which broke on the first use. The handle is very thin, flimsy plastic. I'm being very careful with this but I don't expect it to last very long. A waste of money. Look for something with a wooden handle."
4,"It's good, but not the best","I had the oportunity of reading this book in the Spanish version and I can say It is a good book , but not the best, due to the fact that in some chapters it becomes a little bit boring. What is interesting is the way that it finishes, because we don't expect that Hari's mind work in such a strange way to guess that Etho Dermezel is what it is. So I grade it with a 8 and I'll recommend to read this book first to get interested on the Foundations Trilogy, and to understand it better......."
1,School & Library Binding is disappointing,"Enjoyed the story, all of Asimov's work, this 'One Star' is not for story but for the Turtleback Schools and Library binding... so bad it is hard to believe Amazon would carry this junk. Pages to the left run into the center fold and must be read by peeling the binding back, the pages on the right are the same and seem to be on newsprint - Don't Buy this Schools & Library version with the idea it is better quality, s/b at twice the price - because the paperback version is actually better, and far easier to read."
1,"DO NOT READ, Great series, terrible book","I am a huge Asimov fan. The Foundation series is an amazing work, and I highly highly recommend it. It is thought provoking and forward thinking, way ahead of it's time.While the series itself is well crafted and refined, this book is not. This seemed like a publisher's attempt to squeeze more money out of the good name the series had built up. As I read, I wondered if the book even hit the desk of an editor to trim the fat. Unnecessary filler caused the plot to move at a glacial pace. The dialog between characters is worse than believable, no human speaks the way the characters in this book do.Please do not be offended by this review! I encourage, nay demand that you read The Foundation Series! Just don't let this be your starting point! Read the rest of the books and use this book as a supplement if you feel it necessary. I don't think you will, the series is nourishing enough without this afterthought of a book."
4,A very good read.,"I read the first robot book and was just a little disappointed. But I have enjoyed this book a great deal. It is a thinkers book as it is very short on action.The ideas are interesting and different from many books I have read. The only real complaint I have is some of the characters are a little two dimensional, I find that with many of his books.But it is his ideas and concepts that draw me to reading his books rather than his characters. My only other complaint it is seems a little long and could probobly have been done a little shorter.However it is still a great read and very interesting."
2,"only for devotees - otherwise, boring","There is absolutely no development of the Trilogy concept here, and as such it is only character filler and not that coherent as a novel. Asimov knew what would sell, and he wrote some great stuff, but to be honest I thing he wrote WAY too much. THis is too much.Not recommended."
5,Looking for Sci-fi Excitement?,"Prelude to Foundation by Isaac Asimov, an immigrant from Petrovichi, Russia, is an action packed sci-fi thriller. This book is about a man who believes he has a formula to see the future. He must run from the government because he is afraid of what will happen if they find out how his formula works and release it to the public.I have now read three books in the Foundation Series and can safely say this is Asimov's best. This is an exciting book that will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to learn about the strange worlds inside the author's vast imagination. You'll never guess what happens next because around every corner is the unexpected. This book leaves you hanging until the very end."
5,The biography of Hari Seldon,"I read the Foundation trilogy befor reading Prelude, and Forward the Foundation. I found it interesting to go back and see the life of Hari Seldon. This book fit in perfectly with the Foundation trilogy. I liked that it had Daneel in it, and I was surprised to like Cleon the first, who is the Emperor of the Galactic Empire(you don't actually get to know him until Forward the Foundation). This was a must enjoyable addition to the Foundation saga.P.S. If you get this book you should also get Forward the Foundation = )"
4,Stunning,"Stunningly written novel... the most humanistic and compelling novel ever written by Asimov. A big must! Entertaining and never dull, exactly what science fiction ought to be"
5,This book was my introduction to Asimov,"I was never a science fiction fan, and still am not for that matter. I came across this book by accident and absolutely loved it. This was the introduction to Asimov that prompted me to read the entire series 2 different times. This book, being the most recent, is the easiest to read of the series and seems to progress better. That, combined with a more compact timeline, keeps the reader married to the story and suspense. If you have never read Asimov, I highly recommend the Foundation Series. This book is you starting point."
3,Great but not Brilliant,"For me, Asimov is the master of science fiction, but the early Asimov tends to deliver better on this than the later one. I've read quite a bit of the Foundation series, Including the Original trilogy and the two sequels to it, and now I've finished Prelude to Foundation. I've also read several of his Robot books, and others as well. I think I am confident in saying that Asimov's early work was certainly his his best, but that his later stuff is still great for an Asimov fan. Much like with Foundation's Edge and Foundation and the Earth, Asimov weaves a brilliant and winding story of character on an important journey. But as with these other two, the ending really fails for me. Especially with this story, there seems to be a touch to much of the manipulation by greater forces theme. Still, it is well worth the read, if you are prepared for a similar ending to the Foundation trilogy sequels."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Prelude to Foundation is an after-series prequel, if you will. The book look s at the earlier life of Hari Seldon while is is developing and presenting his theory of psychohistory.Not such an easy process, and he gets married along the way, as well as dodging more than one violent attempt on their persons. Luckily, the spousal unit is handy with a blade, as far as this goes."
3,Only the end reproduces the magic,"I read the original foundation series a year ago and just now read Prelude. Prelude starts off interesting but bogs down in the middle. I put the book down for days at a time before finally getting through to the end. The original trilogy was filled with plot twists driven by edgy logic. Once the plot twist revealed itself you could think back to the clues that hand been given in advance and marvel at how it all made sense. Prelude is largely absent this style until the last 50 pages. The end of the book is quite entertaining, if you can make it that far. BTW, if you are more interested in a visionary interpretation of the distant future, read Arthur C. Clarke's 3001. It's light on plot but his vision of the future is fascinating."
5,"A Must-read for Parents, Educators, and Clinicians","Tom Cottle brings to this book a generous heart, a brilliant mind, and a deep understanding of adolescents and the world they must navigate on their way to maturity."
5,Long Lasting,This is a pretty decent guitar under $100. I got it for chistmas almost 3 years ago and its still in one piece. I've never had any problems with it in the past and it still works well now. Although it is a decent guitar i would only recomend it for practice. It is in no way shape or form a performace guitar.Washburn Electric Guitar Pack
4,Great tote bag!,This is a wonderful tote bag. Its super sturdy and quite large. Great for hauling books or a laptop.
4,great bag for a great cause!,fun bag - something different and i am happy to be putting money toward a great cause
4,Feed Bag concept great for various reasons,When I first saw this product on TV I came to Amazon right away to check it out. I took some time to think it over and I liked the charity aspect behind it.I used a gift certificate from Christmas for Amazon so I thought of it as being two gifts in one. The bag is sturdy and quite useful for a variety of things from a personal tote bag to groceries.My only complaint is that the burlap does leave particles.
1,Why did I think this was a Whole Foods Market bag??,"I was bragging about this bag to my friends but when I showed them the logo, it was WFP and not WFM. It looks so similar to the ones that WFM sells, doesn't it?? If they HAD to use ""WFP"" as their logo, they could have made the bag look totally different from WFM's. I think this is sort of copying and using someone else's idea. Just slightly escaped from the legal issues...Also, if you see the logo on the side pocket, WFP, it is not properly printed. It's not in the middle, and it's even tilted!! How unprofessional...And the burlap dust gets on all over my coat and other clothes!!! They kind of burrow into the fabrics that it is really hard to get rid of. Don't buy it..."
1,another BUSH organization,"yup thats right, Laura Bush came out with these bags. At whole foods market they are $30- $10 goes to feeding children of Rwanda (not even our own kids) $20 to the Bush family for ""administrative reasons"" yeah like to gas a plane from china."
5,FEED BAG,"I was very happy to hear Amazon was offering this item, and am happy to participate in such a wonderful program as Feed Project.I do hope Amazon continues to offer similar items, and will be purchasing through this organization again.Thank you."
1,Food Bag for African children's charity,"It was for a good cause but next time I'll just send the money. The bag is rough, scratchy burlap and the handles don't fit comfortably over my shoulder. It is strong and very big though, so it holds lots of groceries. I wouldn't buy it again."
5,BIG,"This bag is great, its so big and it is reaaalllyy study. I use it at school for all my books and it fits so much more than a backpack. Plus, everybody loves how it looks and the fact that it feeds one kid for a whole school year!"
5,great X 2,Got the bag primarily for the charitable aspect. Turns out I love the bag. I replaced my brief case with it actually. Get lots of comments. The only thing I would change would be to add a loop or ring to attatch keys to so they could be grabbed without digging. I really love the bad. c
5,LOVE it.,"I'm in love with this bag, so glad I got it! People are always commenting. I can fit so much inside it's incredible, very durable too. I wish there were more products like this to benefit such good causes."
5,Feed bag a good and different kind of gift,"This bag is beautiful, stylish, durable and its proceeds feed a child for a year somewhere in the world. Good Idea, World Health Organization!"
3,Disappointed,"The Bag was as described; however, when I ordered it, I was so excited that I would be helping a child receive food for a school year. I was, however, disappointed to find out that only $20 of the $59.95 purchase cost would go to help the child. I thought I would be at least helping two children. I can't believe that administrative costs are so high that only an initial $20 would be given to the child."
2,Sad...,"When I heard about this bag I was so excited that I came straight to Amazon to buy one. It's my style. I love the look of the bag and not to mention not only am I buying a nice bag but also donating money for a worthy cause...to only find out the bag is $60 and only $20 goes to WFP. Not to mention that it's made in China. I'm so upset and disappointed in these people, I mean come on. That's sneaky, shame on you, tell the truth. They should have just said ""listen, if you buy this bag, $20 goes to the fund, we get $37 and the Chinese get $3 per bag."" Whose profiting here?"
5,Great bag for awareness and function,"Yes, only $20 goes to the WFP, but it's still a great bag if you buy it instead of another commercially sold tote. It looks awesome and people ask about it all the time, so I think it's great for creating awareness. My friend actually bought the same bag from a Tom's store! We both love our bags, and they carry a ton. I would never use the white side out, especially because it's all dirty inside now, but the canvas is very bohemian and nice."
5,World Program Feed Bag,"This is a great product - well constructed, money goes for a great cause, AND I take it with me everywhere in an effort to help save the planet by being more GREEN. (No plastic or paper bags when I go shopping!!!!!)"
4,I love my FEED bag!,"I love my bag! I take it to the gym with me almost every day. Its sturdy, eco-friendly and there is plenty of room for my things.It's nice to know that I purchased a product that I use regularly and helped children at the same time."
3,Misleading,"When I first saw this, I too thought it was such a wonderful idea! I was also greatly disappointed in finding out only $20.00 of my dollars would be going to the fund-that's not even half of what I paid. I'm with the other reviewer when she says ""Where does the rest of the $$ go? It's better to give directly so that MORE OF YOUR DOLLARS GO WHERE THEY ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED!!"" Amen."
3,"Great idea, but look closely at the tag","I absolutely love my feed bag. It's great for carrying books to class and stylish to boot. But I have to say that I was very disappointed when I saw that the bag was made in China, which probably means it was created with sweatshop labor. I don't want to compromise some people's rights in order to help others. The program should look into making the bag fair-trade, and then we can proudly show our feed bags!-Stephanie"
4,misleading,"I think the bag itself is great. But it's misleading to tell the customer you are feeding 1 child for a year with the World Food Program for $59.95, when only $20 actually goes to the program."
5,Perfection in a Bag,To be able to get something this stylish and practical while supporting such a heart-warming cause is just incredible. Its a consumer's dream. We need more products like this. I've never felt so good about a purchase. It was the perfect gift for my mom and sister who both love the bag and the story.
2,Just give your money directly,"I loved this bag when i saw it, loved the idea..told everyone about it.. Then it fell apart. I used to back and forth to work to hold my purse and laptop. the burlap started falling apart and leaving burlap pieces on all my clothes...i tried sewing it to make it last longer, didnt work...better to get a 10$ bag and give the other $50 directly to WFP, with the bag only $20 goes and you end up looking a mess due to the burlap falling apart. I think mine started falling apart in three months and i wasnt very tough on it...used it for flying a few times but that and work, and i drive to work so it's not like it was doing much more than being toted from the house to the car and from the car to the office.Also, depending on what you are wearing the burlap can make pulls or wear your clothes in spots... thats why i always used the cotton on the outside...plus the cotton print with the 1 is really great looking."
5,Cool Bag/ Neat Idea,"Very nice bag, big, durable, very cool. Also a very cool idea on how to get people to donate to a fund, AND spread the word about the World Food Program. Love it!"
5,A wonderful way of doing your part to help the HUNGRY!,The bag is well made and I like the fact that it is reversible.What a great idea to help out others! Thanks
2,Very Misleading,"I was very disappointed in this product....not the product itself but the hype about the feeding program. I assumed 100% of the dollars spent which was $60, went to the children. When I received the product there was a tag on it that indicated only $20.00 went to the children...where is the rest of the $$$!!! AND the bag was made in CHINA --- which was insult to injury. Knowing all that, I would have sent $60 to the org and fed three children vs one and forgot the bag.I sent the bag back over three weeks ago and still have not been contacted or credited the money ... Amazon and World Food ..shame on you!"
5,Love this bag!,"I have never gotten more compliments on anything in my life! I have given at least 5 as gifts, and one of the girls I bought it for turned around and bought one for someone else. It seems like everytime I use it someone asks where I purchased it. Store owners ask about it because they want to carry it in their shops."
5,The best gift!,"I immediately passed out the link for my friends to make the donation to this great cause. When I received the bag in the mail a couple weeks later I immediately started using it to carry my items to work. It is great conversation piece as others commented on it. My teenage daughter likes the style of the bag. So, definately I would recommend this product to everyone. Helping others and continue to spread the word to help others with the bag is a great idea. It has been a great experience for me."
4,the feed bag,I didn!t realize how large the bag was going to be. Being some of the money is to go to charity I really don't care.
1,Too little to cause!,"I was very disappointed that only $20.00 goes to feed the kids!I was very disappointed that the bags smelled terrible!I was very disappointed that when I emailed Customer Service to ask if they knew anything that would help with the odor, they sent me more stinky bags! And then they told me I would have to return the first ones or I would be charged for all of them! Guess it takes too long to actually read customers questions!"
1,"Don't buy, give.","Why are people attached to the idea that buying something is an efficient way to help a cause? Think about it this way, this organization claims that ""Each bag purchased feeds a hungry child for an entire year in school, and each t-shirt feeds 100 hungry kids for a day"". How many more children would be fed if you simply gave your money to them and didn't receive a t-shirt or bag in return? Say 100% of the money goes to feeding the children instead of manufacturing the bag or tshirt, not to mention the rest of the mess created by the shipping, etc. Don't buy, give."
2,Feed Nature Bag: Only $6.25 goes to WFP out of $50,"I purchased a FEED Nature Bag today for $50, hoping it will go for a good cause, and since it's also endorsed on the WFP website. On the bag's label, I realized that out of the $50, only $6.25 goes to the World Food Programme - and this translates to the 25 meals mentioned as part of the program.I'm disappointed, as only 12.5% of my donation went for the cause for which I bought the product."
5,ABSOLUTELY PLEASED,My guests will feel right at home when they see they have a place to put their toothbrush. This is a lovely item. I am so glad it was offered along with the other items I ordered to match in the guest bathroom. Matches my shower curtain well.
5,Best Pilates video I've ever used,"This is the only Pilates video I've ever used where I did not get bored with the instructor talking too much or by showing every exercise 5 times before you do it. The workout is a good 30 minutes and by the end, I felt like only 15 minutes had gone by! The instructor is wonderful - showing an advanced version and a beginners version for each exercise. The exercises flow very smoothly and work all muscles of your body. I'm anxious to try the 12-minute extra workout, as well."
2,"Good for beginners, Not challenging for others","What I love most about Pilates is that it strengthens core muscles, and I am usually a little sore after a good Pilates workout. I was not sore at all after this workout. Although Shape Pilates was not boring, it was not challenging either. I think this DVD is excellent for someone who has not exercised in years and would like to begin, but it is not advanced enough for a person who exercises on a regular basis. I did not even break a sweat during the Pilates workout or the bonus strength-training (bonus was a little more challenging than the Pilates workout)."
3,"basic pilates, basic video - nothing special here","Overall, I would say there is nothing really special about this workout. It's all pretty basic Pilates, mostly all done laying on your mat. I would have liked to have some standing work mixed in to get a bit more work on the legs. It also feels really short - it's over before you work up a sweat or even feel slightly fatigued. And the sets are also too short - I like to feel my body straining to complete the last few reps before moving on - I didn't even get close in this DVD.The instructor, while not overly annoying, is definitely not one of my favorites. The way the video is edited, it seems that in between virtually every set, she is saying, ""Okay, moving on..."". I know, not that annoying, but it was noticable - especially after you do the DVD more than once.SHAPE's DVDs are normally my favorites, but this one was a bit of a disappointment."
2,Not a big fan,"This was my first Pilates workout, and I am not such a big fan. I also can't really warm up to the instructor, compared to other dvds I own she is just not as charismatic or inspiring to me."
3,Dope,"I bought this because of Swamburger, so if you're a fan it's pretty cool, if you have no idea who Swamburger is, I'd suggest that you check him out first, then but this album."
1,A piece of junk,Hyponex book looked like it came out of someones trash cover torn had price of $3.99 they charged $4.56 item supposed to be new I got used as indicated on cover Total disappointment
2,hyponex book,The book is informative but took forever to receive. almost a month by then the plants I had questions on died.
3,Finally,"I have been looking for the lapis stone for years. I believe I am correct in saying that it is mined in only one country: PERU. I bought two small pieces to see if I would like them and I do. There is a story behind the lapis stone, that it is a spititual stone, has spiritual qualities. I have read up a great deal on this and obviously believe it. I will be going back to Amazon .com to pick out a pricier one in the near furure. See my next item of lapis."
2,Yuck...,"Really short in the leg. It's not like they're capris, either.I received mine just recently and they were both too large and too short. This is not indicated in the sizing form- and Amazon says it's my fault! Sending them back."
4,Brother of Luke Short,"The first few pages tend to be a little corny about the main character but then it settles down and becomes a very good story, the trail boss Santell is framed by the indian agent with the help of an unreasonable heiress of the ranch whose herd of cattle he has just delivered to an indian reservation, lots of action well written I thought, the only sour point being the quick turn around of the daughter's attitude from a horse's catoot to a wonderful caring human and of course our hero forgives her, bah humbug:-)..Peter Dawson was Luke Shorts brother in real life, both great writers."
1,A blathering bigot,"This is all nothing but fear-mongering nonsense. It is of the highest interest to know that Dannemeyer was/is a close personal friend of Ernst Zundel, the founder of the Holocaust Denial movement, the avowed intent of which is to justify Hitler."
1,Unfortunate waste of a good ISBN number written by a novice researcher,"The author does a spectacular job of citing works and noting the origin of quotes. He would, therefore, receive high marks in the proper way to cite sources. Most (if not all) sources used, however, are one-sided and pathetically bias, not to mention violently radical. For that, he receives EXTREMELY low marks in source balance.This is a shameful example of subjective prose written by one who is obviously angry at something. It is therefore not useful to anyone making an honest effort to learn anything.Basic Rhetoric 101 teaches one to balance the basis upon which the thesis is built. This work is dangerously lop-sided, leaning much too far (and radically) to the right. Beware when approaching: harmful debris may topple upon you."
4,A musicians CD Definately worth a listen.,"I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself liking music without understanding a word of it. I am a classically trained musician and have to say that the composition, arrangement and mixing on this album are world class. If you are more than just a ""listener"", you will definately be wowed. This is the type of CD artists and engineers can learn from. Hoping for an English follow up."
2,Good theory text but skips intermediate steps.,"If you are someone that likes full explanations of concepts and examples, then this is not the book for you. It assumes things that are unwritten so it can be hard to understand how they got from a-to-b in some examples. However if you are steeped in analytical theory and hate dealing with small details because you can naturally make the leap from a-to-c, then this is right up your alley."
3,Didn't like this too much,"The content of Hogg/Craig - even though it is structured chapter-wise - is not too structured in the chapters. Some relevant content is presented in examples, so a reader skipping examples might not get all of the relevant content which is very poor. I didn't like this one too much..."
1,Very poor book.,"This book suffers from a lack of explanatory content. Far, far too little attention is given to explaining things. If you're the type of person who likes to memorize then perhaps this book is for you. I got my bachelor's in math with a 3.9 gpa. I got a 790 on the math portion of the GRE. I have taken a few professionally administered IQ tests and consistently scored more than three standard deviations above the mean. Yet when I read this book I feel like an idiot. Not just kind of dumb, but someone who probably should put down the math and take up a new hobby. I'm not bad at statistics either, I have no problem reading papers or whatever. It is just that this book is so horrible. I am now looking for another book from which to learn.Also the book has low production values. The typesetting is poor, the binding is weak, and the numbering is occasionally confusing. One time the professor assigned the class a specific problem number and every single student did a different problem."
1,don't buy paperback,"I bought a new paperback version. Two days later, chapter 1 is falling out of the book. As for the content, it is really dry. Some solutions are in the back but no explainations. If you have to get this book, go hardback."
1,Not introductory at all,"The book is not introductory to students outside statistics dept or engineering depts. There are logic jumps everywhere and the author doesn't even bother to briefly explain every concept at the beginning of each section, not mention to tell us how to apply this concept in a real situation. This is a required book in a class I am taking. The only reason I bought it is because I got it very cheap. However, I notice that most students in my class don't bother read the book, even student from statistics dept. We basically highly depend on lecture notes, homework solutions, and old exam questions. This is the worst book I read ever. I hope there are some other books out there which do a better job to connect math statistics to real situation."
2,Condition was not good.,Book came on time but the condition of the book was not good. The cover was almost separate from the book. I had to glue the whole book. Not very happy :(
2,***DO NOT*** BY PAPERBACK VERSION!!,"I have no problem with the content of this book. The problem is with the book itself. I got my order in very fast from amazon, but immediately (and I mean within hours) the pages started falling out. I'm not one to complain about the quality of books, but this book is clearly poorly made. I have a classmate who bought the same paperback and I laughed because the first question he asked me was if my pages were falling out. Buyer Beware!"
3,Excellent in its day - but that day has passed,"At the time of its debut (1958) this book was viewed as a fairly advanced treatment of probability and math stat. While it has been updated over the years, it has not kept pace with the rapid changes in the field. (Craig died in 1978!). For those with a bit integral of calculus (it is a math stat book), it is good for review and has some excellent problems (but any answers in the back of the book are simply numeric answers with no explanations). For the right class, it still could be a really good intro to math stat. Be warned - this book gives you nothing in the way of measure and probability but if you can buy it used and cheap, it is well worth having."
1,"Not a good teaching tool. Not to mention, full of typos and inconsistencies.","Much too wordy and difficult to read. Not nearly enough examples structured like the exercises at the end of each chapter. Need to more adequately prove concepts/show origins of concepts (i.e. more than just ""this is what it is, uh, because it is"" or ""because that's how it works out best""). Many typos, so you don't know what to ""trust"" (even one of the tables in the appendix has incorrect values for one of the columns in some printings). Not a good textbook for ""self-teaching,"" hope you have a good professor to learn from."
1,Needs to be re-edited,"This is one of the worst textbooks that I have ever used in my life. Everyone in my class of over twenty people hated this book. Even my teacher did not think it was very good but unfortunately it is a standard text for graduate level statistics. This book needs more examples and to be edited better as there are a good bit of errors. Also, the structure of the book needs to be changed to be more user friendly. The reader should not have to struggle so much to find the information that he is looking for.The subject matter in the book is powerful and useful. However, a good textbook displays the information in an accessible way and this book does not do that."
1,U can do much better,"I took a full year course based on this text. I found it was terse, dated and poorly worded. The explanations of key topics where long winded, meandering and ultimately muddled. The material in each section was rarely of value when confronted with at least half the sections problems. I felt that there should have been more examples that cut to the meat of the problem(such as MLE) showing the mechanics of the solution and giving general strategies to solve real world problems using that technique. I feel that statistics and mathematics is best learned by doing lots of problems and in the case of statistics practicing on real world data. Detailed solutions done by the masters can also go along way to help improve ur analytic skills. I feel this book does not have either feature, covers the modern topic mathematical statistics poorly and should not be used unless the user has severe masochistic tendencies."
1,drier than dirt!,"This is one of the worst probability books I've ever used. The very first paragraph is palatable, and then other coherent texts are required to grasp an understanding of the topic. It's atrocious!!"
4,gets a bad rap,"I don't understand why so many people here hate this book.Yes, it's fairly old. The authors have tried to update it with new computational parts (like EM algorithm).No, it does not feature measure theory. However, many people who want to study and use statistics are not familiar with measure theory either.Yes, it could have been clearer on some counts, but which book can't?I think that the book provides a good introduction to statistical theory.We are using this book for a senior/master's introductory course in Mathematical Statistics, and it fits the audience fairly well.Is it a gem? Probably not. But a good, solid book."
3,"A Strong Standard text, but the binding is flimsy","This is a strong standard text in statistics that I am currently using to teach from in a senior level course for math majors. The coverage of the material is solid and the assortment of problems is excellent. Unfortunately, it currently only seems to be available in paperback and the quality of the binding is very poor. Students in my class who bought used hardcover copies had no troubles, but most of my students who bought new paper bound copies have had the binding crack and pages begin to fall out."
2,How many editions are needed?,"I am a senior in mathematics, and rarely have I had a book so poor as this.The (now sixth (!!)) edition of this book is full of silly errors that should have been fixed in the second or (at the most) third editions. There are multiple errors in the examples, some answers in the back of the book are wrong (these have been verified with other students and with the teacher who is teaching the stat class I am taking), and some figures do not match up to their descriptions. Furthermore, the book is thin on motivations. Some topics in the problem sets are completely left out in the chapters. I definitely do not recommend this book -- find another and save your sanity."
2,Buy this if you don't plan on actually using the book,"Check the products dimensions, the book is 7""x10"" and 2"" thick. with dimensions like this, the book will not lay flat until you are nearly half way through it. having to constantly press the book open to make it lay on a desk without closing on itself makes the front cover through part of the first chapter fall off the book within a month of purchase. If you plan on having a book that lasts more than a single semester, or you want to be able to sell it back for anything over a couple dollars, I'd look elsewhere."
3,Too abstract for the student without some experience in analysis,"It covers most of the introductory topics in mathematical statistics but reading and understanding from the book without some help from the instructor is extremely difficult. If you can get the help from your instructor, its the ideal book to learn the material. By the way, the soft cover sold on Amazon will fall apart in a couple of weeks, buy the hardcover somewhere else if possible. It costs the same.Similar book worth checking out isStatistical Inferenceby Casella and Berger."
1,G Auxier,"I found this book to be just too wordy. The concept was good, children do blame themselves for divorce and look for reasons why they caused divorce but this book is more for adults to understand how children come to those conclusions rather than something that would help a child understand. I felt that it was condescending and not at all believable in terms of what a child would say."
1,Awful!,"I cant believe this book, had to return it was so bad. Dont waste your money and read this first book before buying!"
4,great story,"really nice story to help children understand that divorce is not their fault, which is an almost-inevitable conclusion most kids under the age of 8 will draw. family in the story is obviously a middle class caucasian family having a pretty amicable divorce: families where there has been violence or more argument in front of the kids would want to add some sentences here and there. for example, ""remember when mommy and daddy used to yell/hit/argue all the time? that was scary, wasn't it? we didn't want to scare you, so we decided we were better as friends than as husband and wife. i know it is hard to go from house to house, but now it is not scary and we both love you very much."" that sort of thing."
3,Was it the Chocolate Pudding? A story for Little Kids About Divorce,"I found this book to be directed towards a divorce situation wherethe kids primarily spend time with the father. This would be a perfectbook for that custody agreement. I was surprised that the mother wasonly mentioned toward the end of the book, and a slight attempt to showthe mother is in the childrens life daily. I returned it and ended uplosing money due to shipping."
2,Only if Dad has full custody,"This may be a cute story which deals with the ""its not your fault issue"" however, the book is so slanted towards the father. The kids in the story spend almost all of their time with their father after the parents split and appear to only see their mother for a few hours visitation. I would not recommend this book for the typical split family with joint custody for this reason. It would be great for a father who has received sole custody."
3,The Story of The Misfits,"I was so excited when I heard a book of The Misfits was coming out, my favorite movie with my favorite stars. The layout is beautiful and the pictures are great. I only gave the book 3 stars because it didn't tell me anything 'new' about The Misfits. Just another book with the same things that have been written over and over agin. But for any die hard Marilyn, Monty, Gable, Huston, or Miller fans worth reading."
5,Cheyne does it again!,"I've done some investigation work and with the help of my underground music genius friend, Dj Mix-N-Magic, he located your name and latest release for me. It came out in 2004 and I just found it in 2010 on MP3 format. CD is hard to come by.""Something Wicked Comes This Way"" (2010) is a must hear follow-up to Madison Avenue's ""Polyester Embassy"" (2000). ""Femininity,"" ""Taste You,"" ""Bitch,"" ""I Don't Do Nice"" are fantastic introductions to Cheyne's spin-off album.Cheyne, Thank You - I saw you perform in San Francisco in early 2000s. You are wonderful and a great entertainer...thank you from America, San Francisco, Bay Area. I hope you visit, I will be in attendance. =D"
2,Pretty bad,"How can someone so funny be so not funny in a movie? Did the director just say, ""Martin, do your thang"" and turn him loose to do and say what came to mind? I agree with many of the reviewers that this movie is one of the worst comedies ever made."
2,What was WRONG with Martin?,"What was WRONG with Martin Lawrence when he agreed to do this mess? Essentially, this is a low-grade millennium version of the 1931 Will Rogers satire ""A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court"", which itself was based on Mark Twain's novel. Will Roger's original film about a modern man who dreams he is transported to the middle ages was bad, but this is even WORSE! Bad acting, corny story, gross-out humor, ad nauseum. However, the scene with Martin teaching the medieval musicians to play Sly Stone's ""Dance to the Music"" is mildly amusing, as his outrageous speech to rally the peasants against the King (a wild mixture of Al Sharpton, Rodney King, and John F. Kennedy), and Marsha Thompson as his love interest is rather easy on the eyes. These latter factors give it 2 stars instead of 1. But if you like Martin Lawrence, stick to his TV show."
1,SOO BAD,"I do not know why this movie has been getting good reviews from others. This movie was so bad and just a waste of time. I unfortunately had to take a friend to this movie for their birthday. After watching it I wished I didn't even have that friend. If you want to laugh at Martin Lawerence , stay home and see the early episodes of Martin."
3,Black Knight,"Fast-talking con-man Jamal Walker has big-time plans--but for now he's stuck in a menial job at a medieval theme park. After slipping into the park's fetid ""moat,"" Jamal finds himself in 14th century England--a world of knights in shining armor, a wicked king and damsels in distress. The Middle Ages will never be the same after Jamal uses his 21st century street smarts and attitude to help a down-and-out knight and a beautiful woman defeat an evil king. Black Knight is extremely funny but slow on the on plot and not as much action as I thought. Martin Lawerence wasn't his best but he brought the laughs."
2,Better script would have helped.,"The main idea of this Martin Lawrence vehicle had some potential. A black, young adult, under achiever with potential gets sent back to medieval times to learn a valuable lesson. Some of the bits are funny and Lawrence shows he has some talent, but there was nothing solid enough here that to make us feel that we wanted to watch it again, unless it came on TV with the language edited.It could have even been done to be more family friendly, but it wasn't. This movie is at best AVERAGE or 2.5 stars. I'll round down to 2 stars for some language."
1,Awful,"What hit has Martin Lawrence been in other than BAD BOYS? And that was a co-starring role. And that was a number of movies ago. Martin Lawrence has starred in flop after flop since. And big flops! Why do movie studios keeping funding his movies?! They're bad, as this one is, and they flop. He over-acts, and I only hope studios stop employing him."
1,Totally a waste of time and money,"I am a big fan of knight and magic stuff. Although this movie has a attractive title, it's deceptive as well. It really has nothing to do with knight and magic, it's just making shabby jokes that i don't feel interesting at all. I just think it's not worthy of time and money, unless you are rich at both of them."
3,this should have had a white guy in it.,"the story goes that a amusement park worker falls into a magical water that sends him to this other place in mid evil times.he pretends to be a french guy so he can stay at the castle.he runs into trouble soon enough!martin lawrence who was like the one black guy who didnt talk crap on whites all the time sold out and is now with chris rock and chapelle as hate mongers.the kids can watch it.its not too bad.there is a sex scene but thats it.its not as good as a lot of midevil movies but they arent usualy comedies either.theres a few nasty poop jokes/scenes.thats sick and uncalled for.theres this one hot white chick and a not so hot black chick who is martins ol lady by movies end.there was this joke the racist martin told i thought was pretty funny during his rallying speech to the troops.there was once a great man named rodney king who said""ow ow ooh ugh!""lol ha ha ha!this is his second best movie behind blue streak."
5,Delightful,"This film made me laugh from beginning to end. It's a delight to see Martin's rendition of ""A Conneticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"". Twain would be proud. Some may see this is just another movie about a hip, black comedian changing the lives of uptight crackers. It IS that but a whole lot more. The jokes are refreshingly funny and the social commentary is written into the script extremely well. I think I'll have to see it again just to catch all the quick quips Martin Dishes out as well as all the funny things that happen in the background."
1,Top Ten Worst Films,"This has to be one of the worst films I have seen in years. Futile attempt to be funny. In this film Martin Lawrence was a certifiable ham who failed miserably in trying to evoke even a smile of amusement. It was like watching an awful stand up comic who was bombing all over the place and just kept going on and on. I couldn't believe I even watched such an awful film. He just keeps on shooting his mouth off, unfortunately his portrayal as an obnoxious loud mouth was not funny at all. I was even wondering if he had a script or did he just blabber away whatever came to mind as they shot the film. I was even trying to find some other elements in the film that could give at least some moment of pleasure... sadly it wasn't even mildly entertaining. I can only report what I experienced, annoyance! So why did I even bother writing here.... to save some people the agony and frustration of watching the film."
4,Funny show,I thought this movie was pretty funny and Martin did a great job. The fighting scenes and the plot was pretty stupid and unreal but hey! what does it matter for a comedy? It could uuse less of the classical medieval times music but the others was pretty good. I'm still wondering what the Beenie Man song is t the beginning of the movie. ...
2,Not bad but not great...,"I'm not a huge fan of Martin Lawrence but I had seen the preview for the movie and thought it might be worth a laugh (besides...I had a free rental!). I have to admit that the first time I watched it, I didn't find it funny. However, I ended up watching it again with a friend and was mildly surprised the second time around.It certainly isn't Martin Lawrence at his best. Tom Wilkinson as Knolte was disappointing...not for his portrayal but the fact that he chose to be in a movie like this. The best part of the movie for me was Percival, played by Vincent Regan. An almost unknown actor here in North America, this was certainly not the greatest bit of acting he's done. For a sample of what he can really do, check out his performance as Buck in The Messenger: Joan of Arc by Luc Besson. (Whatever you do, don't rent the poorly done Point Men).This is one of those movies that, if you don't take it too seriously (and you're not supposed to), you might enjoy it!"
1,This Movie [stinks],"This movie is a remake of so many of those throwback 90's movies with the same plot, stupid idiot goes back in time, does great things, makes not a single funny joke, and then comes back from the past a changed and better person. This might have been good for 6 year old kids, with a 6 year old actor - but oh wait, that was already done and it [stinks] too! This is a dissapointing film from mildly talented comedian who must be hard up for cash. I only hope that he didn't help write the dialogue, because at least he could say ""hey, I was broke, naw, I didn't write that stupid frappucino line"""
3,black knight,the movie was funny. but it was an older movie my husband wanted. He thought it was hilarious. a good movie to watch on a rainy day
1,It doesn;'t even DESERVE A STAR,"One of the worst ""movies"" I've ever seen. All there is to see and hear is inner city slangs, bring downs, jokes and talk ... ""white people"" this ... ""White girl"" that ... ""AWRIGT!"" ... ""I got ya back"" ... ""You know what I mean"". If I had to watch the movie all over again and count who many times those phrases are repeated I'd throw myself into a horse's behind 1st. Dialog consist of Lawrence's ""improv"" & aledgedly funny facial expressions throughout the WHOLE movie. Script is simply HORRIBLE. Set is HORRIBLE. Cast is HORRIBLE. Don't waste your money on this HORRIBLE movie."
1,O Stars - Absolute Garbage!!!,"Black Knight owns the distinction of being the only film that I have ever walked out on and received a refund for. This movie was just plain awful. It was nothing more than an extended play version of the Martin Lawrence television show. However, this film was not funny at all! I don't even know how it ended and I do not care. I left during the dinner scene when Martin leads the band in a Sly and The Family Stone cover. The jokes were juvenile, the direction - deplorable, the story - lame, lame, and more lame. The stereotypical ""brotha from the hood in a strange setting"" plot has been done to death and it IS NOT FUNNY! Please, whatever you do, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS UNFORGIVABLE PIECE OF JUNK!"
3,Eh,"I usually like time-travel movies, but this one obviously didn't take itself seriously or do an adequate amount of research. No wait, I'm sure the writers did some research, but they chose to ignore some of it, since the past that the 'Black Knight' travels to is not entirely historically accurate, and it's clear that this was intended. Martin Lawrence is fairly funny, but this movie definitely could have been better."
3,Not Too Funny But Not Too Bad Either,"I saw this film when it was released in theaters. I now own it on DVD. Why? Well, it grew on me. It's not that funny, but, it's still an entertaining film nonetheless. Plus, Martin Lawrence plays a different character for a change. The last time I saw him play someone outside of a cop or con-man/crook was A THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE (the best of Lawrence's films as far as I'm concerned). I won't bother giving details about the plot of Black Knight for other reviewers have done so already. The film does have a sense of morality to it as well as a little action and sword-fighting. I actually like the fight sequence especially when Martin does a little sword-fighting himself. Anyway, if you're looking for an entertaining film, give this one a try. You'll be satisfied."
3,Lawrence as a knight of today and yesterday,"3 of 5 stars for the comedy movie Black Knight. A worker (Martin Lawrence) in a medieval theme park finds himself transported back in time to the 1300's (Middle Ages) after getting a bump on his head. Finding himself between several factions and even a plot to overthrow the king, our hero ""Skywalker"" even has a beautiful maiden to rescue.Well photographed, well written and pretty funny at times, this movie is easy on your brain and entertaining. Lawrence is good and fun to watch. Yes, this is a good movie and worth watching."
4,"Sure...it's not accurate, but who cares?","Martin Lawrence does a nice job to entertain in this movie.The plot is nothing fantastic...a simple tale of an urban African-American that stumbles into medieval England. He has to pretend he's French in order to help the villagers understand why he's so different, and his existance there ends up causing a huge ruckus as his identity is slowly unmasked.If you were looking for something that would be even remotely about history, I don't recommend you seeing this. If you're just looking for an outrageous comedy that is satirical of black and white cultural differences, then you've come to the right place."
5,Transcendent,"This series..few words can describe the scope, the depth, the sheer creativity put into Broken Saints, both in the original flash form but also in the new DVD editions - a terrific story, beautiful art and effects, music that any hollywood producer would kill to have, and a splendid voice cast to boot. A true work of love and dedication, and a new artform in and of itself.Some people might find it slow. I feel bad for those people, as they're missing out on true beauty!"
3,"Broken Saints, Broken Dialog","The visuals in Broken Saints are beautifully drawn but the spoken dialog does this comic epic a disservice. First, it's confusing to have both spoken dialog and subtitles / word bubbles. But second, and more importantly, the spoken voices (especially the female voices) are lightweight compared to the dark and brooding nature of the illustrations. It's like Paris Hilton reading a Stephen King audio book!"
2,"Good graphics, boring storyline...","I myself don't care very much for apocalyptic stories, save for a few. But, my parents got this for me for Christmas, thinking it was kind of anime-ish (I GUESS it counts as anime - I dunno!)and thought I would like it. I love comics and anime/manga, so this was intriguing. The idea itself of animated comics is a good one, and they way the ""panels"" displayed on DVD was brilliant. The storyline, however, literally put me to sleep! Things move very, very slowly,and all the characters' dialouge was poetic to the point of overkill and, to me, blocked my understanding of what was going on in general. I'm starting to wander if this comic epic was just praised for the graphics. If so, how dissapointing! My parents wasted thier money on this one."
1,"Pretentious, clichéd, and trite","This 'film' is a complete waste. It's nothing more than monologues strung together played over scenes of minimal animation, that amounts to backgrounds moving. And the script isn't even interesting, little more than a speaker talking in a monotone about skyscrapers created with 'sweat and semen mortar' 'thrusting into the gaping starry sky womb'. I'm sorry, but that's just awful dialouge. The writer is obviously attempting to sound profound, but just comes off as artifical and clichéd.The character designs are horrible as well, with disproportioned faces and bodies.The whole mishmash reads as someone who's just purchased flash and completed on Intro to Philosophy class. I STRONGLY advise you to pass on this."
4,"Amusing story, giant cast.","I didn't expect Oscar caliber acting, especially when the star is a 7' Australian former pro-wrassler. Nathan Jones does a respectable job as the gentle giant who has to survive after being drugged, robbed of all but his pants, and trying to help two pint sized girls who have come to his aid. The one girl is a real junior women's champion Muay Thai boxer ( a style of mixed martial arts) and could kick the snot out of just about anybody she meets while her sister is a sticky-fingered charmer. Cheesy, charming, nasty bad guys and lots of general mayhem. I'd like to try some of the somtum ""salad"" since I like spicy food but I'm afraid I would burst into flames."
2,Glad to see Nathan Jones in a lead role,"but otherwise I suffered through this. I've seen Jones in minor roles as the big guy Goliath who falls to a smaller but more skilled fighter - in Troy to Brad Pitt's Achilles, in Fearless to Jet Li's Huo Yuanjia, in The Protector to Tony Jaa's elephant advocate. Enjoyable to watch him play a major role, which is light on the dialogue but mostly physical comedy. And he's great at it. Curious if there was any conscious intent by the writer or director to give a nod to Curly from the Stooges.So why the two-star hate? The teen Muai Thai champion story line is overdone, which would have worked out if this was a Disney movie, but there was too much violence for that. Most of all, the bad guys were really aweful. A combination of bad acting and bad writing."
4,A collector's piece,"Watching Van Morrison perform with an impromptu band and still nail it is a true delight. Oh, and what's more? Pete Wingfield!"
5,BF loves it,"I got this for my boyfriend, who loves Van Morrison. The music is great, but Van's stage prescence is the real entertainment. Any Van Morrison fan would love this DVD."
5,Amazing shows--will there be a CD release as well?,There are two top-flight shows and it's wonderful to see Van opening the vaults; has anyone heard whether he will follow Bruce Springsteen's lead and release the audio from these shows on cd?
3,Pity about the region code,Awesome gig for any Van fan. Watched the first DVD of the 1980 gig and imagine my disappointment when I put the 1974 gig on and it wouldn't play as the code was wrong for the region.
2,VAN MORRISON,"IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF HE SANG IN ENGLISH. I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND A WORD HE SINGS. I LOVE HIS MUSIC, BUT I PROBABLY WILL NOT EVER WATCH AGAIN."
3,Disappointing,I was disappointed with this DVD. The original taping was apparently not very good and the quality of this DVD suffers. An old CD I have of van morrison has better sound and is a better performance. Some of the songs are good but a couple of my favorites seem rushed and not as good as other recordings.
2,Boring!,"After watching Van's performance in ""The Last Waltz"" we were eager for this DVD. I'm a casual fan of his music and I just couldn't get into this - either 1980 or 1974. Van appears to be bored, almost sleepy, throughout most of his performances. He has a great voice but doesn't have the energy level to keep my interest. I own many music DVD's and I'm sorry to say this is not one we will watch again anytime soon. My personal favorite is U2 - Live from Boston and REM - Perfect Square. Also, just loved The Last Waltz - we got it as a freebie blue ray disk and it is classic."
5,Another Great Video from Montreux,"I own about 6 DVDs that were recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival. I am amazed that the video and especially the audio quality of them. They must have staged mikes all over and sent them to invidual channels when they taped. I am very pleased with the 5.1 audio mix.Some of the DVDs I have are from shows recorded back in the 1970's yet the 5.1 mix is always good. Not just the same information coming out of all the speakers.As far as the material goes it was like listening to differnt versions of songs I had heard growing up. Not bad versions, just different. All in all it's very enjoyable."
5,Amazing,For years I have been searching for SOMETHING on Van Morrison on DVD/Video and finally something is here. It's not my favourite era of Van but I will take what I can and it is awesome. The sound and vision is great. This DVD is worth every cent and some. I too would have paid $150 for it!
4,Montreux Jazz Festival,Classic Van Morrison. Montreux Switzerland is a good setting and watching Van Morrison and other work together is fascinating. I feel good about obtaining this DVD and look forward to watching it many times. Makes me appreciate Van Morrisons current efforts and when I attend a concert all the more.
1,Wobbly cake pan,"I was super excited to get this cake pan for the Superbowl and had grand plans for a chocolate football cake. When I put it in the oven, the cake pan had bent (due to the heat) and then leaned very heavily to the lower right hand side which made the cake batter in the pan ooze out which eventually burned. I had to use a large espresso cup to prop up the right side and use a large latte mug to hold down the left side. As a result, the cake didn't cook evenly and created a mess. I'm sure there are higher quality, more durable football shaped cake pans out there. I wanted one on the cheap and I now wish I hadn't."
3,A Little Trouble Baking,"I had the same problem as some of the other reviewers - the top of the cake was golden brown long before the middle stopped jiggling. I cooked it varying the temp between 300-325 so as not to brown the top too much. I made cupcakes with the same cake batter and the cupcakes turned out much nicer, but the cake was still pretty good. It was great for my son's sports themed first birthday and I'll use it again for football parties. I might even try the bread idea that's in the instructions manual."
3,The second serial of Robotech: the Sentinels #1,"These are very likeThe Works of E. E. ""Doc"" Smithand his Lensmen.One step above a comic book in the space opera serial tradition ofBuck Rogers these novels have romance and adventure withplenty of very bloody battles. Battlestar Gallactica in the seriesfor TV is very much like this with somewhat less imaginative aliens.It seems to understand a lot of the ""details' you have to have readsome of the previous serials.This sort of novel is almost pure escapist literaturethat is read by teenage boys instead of doing their home work.I actually kind of liked it,but it isn'tThe City and the Stars and the Sands of Mars!"
3,"umm, naaaahhhh!!","Ok you've got this tune which is nothing like normal Twin which is probably the one song that has generated the most Aphex Twin fans, probably ending there though realising that nothing much he's done is like it. The remaining tunes are pretty dissapointing, just ones with funny vocals which are funny only once, but so not good compared to Richard's other works such as the I Care album. I give this e.p. a 3 though because it contains my favourite Twin tune because it's beautiful; Flim"
1,Roach Bomb,"I use this record to scare the cockroaches out of my house. If that's your thing, fine, go for it."
2,"strange, and very boring.","When I was at the store yesterday, I saw ""come to daddy"", and it was only $11, I was thinking of buying it, but I bought underworld, pearl's girl instead(which was the same price) and ever since then I've been wondering why ""come to Daddy"" is so cheap. Now after listening to the recording I see why; it sucks. It has wierd noises, and distorted voices.I guess the people who gave this cd five stars beacuse it shows emotion are sort of right. Some music makes me want to cry, some makes me want dance, but this makes me want to throw up. Don't get it."
2,Superficial and numbing,Superficial and numbing...But that's maybe how you want to feel when you listen to it.To me it's music that doesn't tell you ANYTHING.It's like one BIG joke or maybe that's what it's meant to be.Music that lacks soul or emotion.Or maybe I just don't get it.A lot of my friends rave about it so I've given it ago but...Whats it ALL about anyway??It just sounds frustrated and stunted. Music that doesn't really go anywhere or say anything..
4,Deranged droppings,"To still be regarded as electronic's most inspired act despite staying relatively quiet for almost a decade must attest to how powerful this programing really was in its prime. This worthwhile and diverse EP lingers with an upbeat dementia, naturally causing James to be at his involved best."
3,I WILL EAT YOUR SOUL!,come to daddy(pappy mix) and bucephalus bouncing ball are great!5 stars for these two cuts.To Cure a Weakling Child is quite good too and funny man is funny in a sick way. 4 starsOther tracks i'll say are just to call it an EP and not a single CD. This is the reason for giving it 3 stars.Good cover art by Chris Cunningham.Buy it.
4,Flim.,"Richard James is such a gifted craftsman in the game of electronica, weaving a diverse range of moods, rhythms, and sounds. The main attraction on this EP is the abrasive title track, which sounds like an unholy marriage between drum-and-bass and industrial. But the real standout is ""Flim,"" one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've ever heard. Set to a frenzied beat with angelic synth touches and computerized strings, it really delivers a total sense of calm. The rest of the EP are remixes and non-album tracks, but they don't stand up to the surreal elegance of that amazing track. First time listeners should probably check out ""I Care Because You Do"" or ""Richard D. James Album"" first, but the cut ""Flim"" is almost worth the price of ""Come to Daddy."""
4,Not bad but I prefer Mobius Dick,"This is good stuff, but I prefer the somewhat more melodic techno of, say, Mobius Dick or Digital Ritual."
3,sinister and depraved,"this cd is one sinister and depraved(neccesary elements for GOOD music) but it is all good in the end. i will warn you now that this truly is music for weirdos. ear friendly in an off beat kind of way it turns from death metal, soul shattering music to more ear friendly mellow and then to chilling eerie music to scare people with. this music is extraordinary. different and fresh and it has lots of soul. lots of soul, i say but in a different way. truly great electronic bunny in a blender music."
3,Not Richard's Best,"RDJ's work gets a lot better than this. It's a fun EP and the title track is a nifty song, but it's really a musical mess and compared to some of his better more structured (more listenable) work, this falls far short. However, this is still a good EP in its own right, and probably has more mainstream appeal than, for example, On."
4,not his best but pretty freakin cool,i like some new material but this is pretty good too. i have nightmares with kids with rdj's face.
5,Get it,"Great music. The first track is a shock coming from RDJ, but after a while it grows on you. The companion video, with Chris Cunningham's direction, is a must have as well. Most of this is exerimentation in texture and impossibly complex rhythm, constantly shifting grooves....lovely. But is it my imagination, or is the whole thing a commentary on paedophilia?"
4,777444.,"Come To Daddy makes use of funny noises and distorted vocals, most certainly, but to reduce it to that alone is pure close-mindedness. But I suppose when you're used to listening to the glossy, brainless, pre-programmed loops of a techno act like Underworld, which could be replicated by anyone with an expensive keyboard in 5-10 minutes, it's silly to even consider music that makes use of that old-fashioned thing called creativity. Not that I honestly want to hail Come To Daddy as a masterpiece, or anything ... I doubt it's my favorite Aphex Twin album, but ... to compare this unfavorably to something as trite as Underworld is thoroughly unacceptable. : )"
2,Three words: Where's the score?,"I bought this album because I thought perhaps a miracle would happen and there would be some music from the actual M:I2 score on there, but sadly, I was disappointed. I like the Limp Bizkit version of the M:I theme, but it's nowhere near as cool as the renditions of the theme actually used in the film. Other than that, this album is nothing more than a rap-metal collection, which is not a particular favorite genre of mine.We saw this happen in 1996, too -- when M:I1 was released, the first CD we got was a ""songs from and inspired by"" disc (except that one was actually pretty good). Later, the original score was released. If you liked the background music in M:I2, do NOT buy this album, simply because there isn't any of it on there. Instead, wait for them to release a score album...which I hope they do!Till then, save your money."
2,3 Good Songs on the whole cd,"I had very high expectations for this cd after hearing the incredibly great theme song by Limp Bizkit. However, once I listened to the rest of the songs, I realized that I had completely wasted my money. The Metallica song is great, and the last song by the great Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, The Rock) is good too, but the rest of the cd is horrible...."
2,Take A Look Around (at trendy rock),"This CD contains only a couple tracks I thought were good: They Came In..., Immune by Tinfed, and Carnival by Tori Amos, but other than that... no real standouts. The whole soundtrack blurs together into approximately an hour of dumbed down music designed to cater to the masses without giving them anything new at all. The music sounds the same, this is NOT intelligent or interesting music."
1,MI-2,"Very upset, loved the powerful music in the movie, hate the CD. I'm 50 yrs old, and really enjoy instrumental music, especially "" New Age"" or ""World Music"". Buthole Surfers, I should have known better !"
1,Major Disappointment,"This so-called ""soundtrack"" is a waste of money and contains very few of the actual songs featured in the movie. I urge all who agree to log an e-mail complaint at HollywoodRecords.go.com by clicking on the MI2 Logo and then the ""E-mail Us"" link. Demand that a REAL soundtrack be made!"
1,Mission Impossible:2 (Soundtrack),"I am a real fan of Hans Zimmer's work, so I automatically bought the soundtrack. Only to find that the CD contained anything but the musical themes from the film. To be fair, the fine print does read ""inspired"" by the film. Had they released two CDs, one for the marketing boys (the bunch of mostly unrelated tracks they did release), and a second CD of the actual soundtrack, as has occured with many other films, I wouldn't mind, the former being just another example of new millenium merchandising reality. I can only hope the second CD is released sometime soon as the actual soundtrack deserves to be heard in its own right."
2,Save your money,"I saw the movie and expected the CD to be great. I was very disappointed. There are a few good songs, but overall, I was not satisfied."
5,Rob Zombie saves this otherwise Disappointing CD,"Well I waited quite sometime for this CD and when I got it, it was hardly impressive. Limp Bizkit's performance was hardly worthy of the Main Theme. The track was only good when they incorporated the Mission Impossible theme into metal, though it only lasted about 15 seconds every minute or so. Metallica's ""I Disappear"" was good until the vocals started, which was about 20 seconds into the song, after that it was pretty annoying with constant stop and go's. Rob Zombie's song ""Scum Of The Earth"" was in my opinion the best song on the entire CD. It is loud and heavy. The song is definently great to jam out to. The rest of the CD is decent, Apartment 26's ""Backwards"" was probably the only other track worthy of listening to. But in the end I give this CD five stars because Rob Zombie's song keeps it in my CD player."
2,Why are the good songs in the front and they just get worse?,"I expected much more of this soundtrack than I received. I really did. The Limp Bizkit theme, Take A Look Around is the best song on the CD, but it seems the songs just get worse and worse as the CD goes along. It seems like after Rob Zombie, The Scum Of The Earth, the CD takes a nosedive with the Butthole Surfers which absolutely suck. The Foo Fighters song makes a decent attempt to pull the CD back, but it falls short. The back of the CD is all unknown bands, or people that suck. The Hans Zimmer song is some sort of Mexican Village music sounding more like something from The Mask of Zorro, or the Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time. Tape the first two songs on the radio, and stay away from this CD."
3,"Finally, some NEW Rob Zombie...",".....But on an otherwise. boring a plain cd.Let's face it, ""Product"" By Limp Bizkit just proves that they ARE a product.Metallica get EVEN lighter with ""I Disappear"" (Not that I should care, I hate Metallica anyways....)Rob Zombie definetly makes this cd interesting. He makes a return with a fast heavy speed metal song, Scum of the Earth. Any Zombie fan will indulge.Apartment 65 is also a good band on here but cannot compare to Zombie.An Average cd, if you just want some regular rock, then I guess you'll like this."
2,close but no cigar,The mi:2 soundtrack falls short of what i expected. I purchased it and could not wait to pop it into my cd player but to my suprise limp bisqut butchered the mission impossible theme. after listening to all the songs for about a minute i ended up leaving it on my shelf with ohter cd's that didn't live up to there potential
4,"""Impossible"" not to love this CD","Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to buy this CD...Almost every song on here rocks. Limp Bizkit kicks it off with the stunning new theme (it rivals the first one). Then Metallica slams some head banging, air guitaring metal with the second song I Disappear. Rob Zombie, Butthold Surfers and Tori Amos just don't seem to fit though. But tracks 6-14 kick. The ""mission"" is completed with a funky little guitar number by Hans Zimmer which will probably run over the end credits.Accept the mission...This review will self-destruct in 5 seconds."
4,"Great CD, in spite of some crap songs","This CD is really cool, it has a little something for everyone. But be warned, some of the tracks really really suck, which is why I hate listening to the CD in numerical order. They're all towards the beginning. (3 and 4 are actually the only ones like that.)Well, I'm tired. I'll stop typing now."
2,Only 3 good songs,"Like most people my favorite song on it is ""I disappear"". I also liked ""scum of the earth"" I'm not a Limp Bizkit fan and only like about 3 or 4 of their songs but ""Take a look around"" is pretty good. After the first 3 songs the cd goes down hill."
1,Disappointing,"I should have known from looking at the back of the CD cover that this CD was going to be disappointing. What from M:i-2 ""inspired"" some of the songs on this CD is a mystery to me -- The CD starts out with rage and, well, continues to rage until it gets to the last two songs. The only tracks on the CD that are worth listening to, for me, are Limp Bizkit's reworking of the M:i theme into ""Take A Look Around"", Tori Amos' ""Carnival"", and Hans Zimmer's (a teaser for his Score CD) ""Nyah."" Other than that, the CD seems to have no real connection to the film. A waste of money."
3,When CD is to the soundtrack as the movie is to the series,"OK I admit it, I walked out of the movie theatre and walked straight into the store to buy the CD expecting to hear the moody guitars and melodic hypnotic ambience throughout the film. Yes I saw the ""Inspired by..."" on the case but didn't realise the entire album was going to be inspired.However the music is good just not was portrayed in the film, which can (And did in my case) lead to a little disappointment.So as the film was inspired by the TV series (And had little real similarity) so the album has been inspired by the music of the film."
4,Metallica: Untouchable 2,"Metallica's contribution is incredible. The rest of the album is run of the mill. Limp is horrible. Did I mention the metallica track is stellar. In all fairness, the foo track is very good also. But limp is still terrible. should have had incubus on there! uncle kracker band? give me a break. more like uncle crapper."
4,"Not the Best Movie Soundtrack, but Fine Just the Same","Great move M:I-2 was, and this soundtrack (not the score) is pretty good. It has some well-known artists, Limp, Metallica, Foo Fighters, etc., and most of the songs are good. Limp did a good job with the movie theme in ""Take a Look Around"" but some other lesser-known artists dont quite fare as good.Some songs are bland and forgettable, but a justifiable purchase nontheless. Buy if you really like good movie soundtracks and the hard rock genre."
5,AWESOME,"I USUALLY DON`T BUY SOUNDTRACS BUT HAVE HEARD THE TAKE A LOOK AROUND SONG ON THE LOCAL RADIO STATION AND WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH IT.Have to admit best song they have on the table yet I listen to Significiant Other dailey one of my favorites CD`s this song should go all the way to the top in no time.Not a big fan of Foo Fighters but there song Have A Cigar was also a great tribute to this CD Godsmack song was good but not what I expected out of Godsmack,Rob Zombie good song but better beat great music.But have to mainly tip the hat to Fred Durst and group you out did yourself this time hope to hear the rest of the album in July."
4,A great soundtrack-one of the best I've heard.,"Overall, I like this soundtrack a lot. Metallica's ""I Disappear"" is the best track on this cd, in my honest opinion. Buckcherry's ""Alone"" is also good, and the second best track in my opinion is the instrumental flamenco tune ""Nyah"" written by Hans Zimmer. Never have I heard such cool flamenco guitar!"
3,"Descent movie, descent soundtrack","M:I-2's soundtrack follows perfectly with the movie. What I would like to know is why Tori Amos is on the same album as rap-metal heads Limp Bizkit? Sure, their are some great rock tracks by Metallica, Rob Zombie, Godsmack, and Limp, but their are also some really stale songs on here, that seem to have nothing in common with the movie. Chris Cornell's song is just another one of his boring songs, from his flopped solo project. But, who the hell are the band,Pimps? That is just another rap-metal following band, with an even worse song. You may have to use your skip button on this album a little more than once. I do reccomend it, but watch out for some stale songs!"
4,Satisfying..................,"When i saw M:I2 in theaters I wasnt sure if i should by the soundtrack or not because well there isnt one song in the movie. but when i looked at the back and saw the track list i knew i had to buy it. With bands and artists like Limp Bizkit, Metallica, Unkle Kracker (produced by Kid Rock), Rob Zombie, Godsmack, Buckcherry, and the Foo Fighters i knew i would like it. Limp Bizkit's ""Take A Look Around"" is easily the best song on the cd, and Metallica's ""I Disappear"" takes a peak into thier Alternative/Poppy side which im happy to say is quite good. Godsmack's ""Goin' Down"" fits in well as does Buckcherry's ""Alone"". All in All this soundtrack is very good and has some surprisingly good songs by bands i had never heard of like Diffuser with ""Karma"", ""Backwards"" by Apartment 26, and Powderfinger's ""My Kinda Scene"". Good Soundtrack to a not so musical but Good Movie."
2,SO-SO,"I have to say that I purchased this CD for two reasons. Limp Bizkit and Metallica. More so for Metallica since i am a very Die-Hard fan. I love their song ""I Dissapear"" but it is nothing compared to ""Master of Puppets"" ""...And Justice for all"" etc, etc. The first three songs were great! Then once it hit the Foo Fighters song it really plunged into nothingness. It seems that when they put this CD together, they thought the people would listen to the whole thing after Rob Zombie's remix of ""Scum of the Earth"" They were VERY WRONG."
2,Disappointing,"The lineup is flashy. The songs are new. At first glance, what's not to like about this album, which features a great picture of Tom Cruise on the cover?Actually, there's lots not to like. The album charges out of the gate with the Limp Bizkit version of the ""Mission: Impossible"" Theme. Metallica follows it up with a less than-subpar effort ""I Disappear"". One of their worst songs in recent memory, this coming from a die-hard Metallica fan.The only songs that are even worth mention are ""What U Lookin' At?"" (Uncle Kracker), ""Alone"" (Buckcherry), and ""Immune"" (Powderfinger). Every other song, whether it be rock-metal or rap-metal, thoroughly disappoints and leaves the listener quite mad. At the price of about 16 bucks, it's the biggest rip-off of the century. Do NOT buy this album."
3,buy this for 2 songs,"only reason i bought this album is b/c i wanted the metallica song i disappear, but upon playing it all the way through i found out scum of the earth (R. ZOmbie) is one hell of a listen too...but the rest of the cd sucks balls."
4,A nice metal soundtrack!,"To those who bitched about the lack of a score, READ THE BACK OF THE CD!!! Anyway, a great CD with especially good stuff from our boys Metallica. The opener by Limp Biskit is actually pretty good despite the fact I hate their regular stuff. Godsmack has a really great song here which is also better than most of the songs on their own CD. Zombie is excellent as usual. Chris cornell's song is unusual yet still shows his talant. Even Tori Amos (!) has a nice yet heavy tune on here. Despite the lack of a score the last track is very cool and uses very different styles in an unusual way. Metal"
3,"some good, some boring songs","About half the songs on the album are really good like all the ones for which Amazon.com has the music samples (i.e. Buthole Surfers, Limp Bizkit and Metallica), but the other songs didn't grab me. If you like the songs sampled here, then it wouldn't be a bad way to spend your money, but otherwise, skip it."
1,1 star for one good song,"O.k I'm I the only one who did not enjoy the whole cd? The one good song on the cd was take a look around. Which is a pretty awesome song. I'm sorry to say this kiddies but if your buying this cd for the fact that Limp Bizkit is on it, than you will be better off burning it."
2,Save your money!,"I originally bought this CD for the theme song. I didn't know that the trailer and the web site only use the first 15 seconds of the song, because thats the only good part. Limp bizkit ruined a perfectly good theme song by singing. The rest of the cd wasn't that good, either.. There were maybe 2 other decent tracks on the CD."
4,"Great illustrations, but a bit abstract for a 3 year old.","We love the Maisy books, videos. This book is great because it's big and the illustrations are equally grand. The concept was a little hard to understand from the pictures though - that she is dreaming - so silly things are pictured. Panda and Maisy are mermaids, a teapot and teacup have legs, a pencil is a butterfly, etc. My son was a little perplexed at first, and then just laughed. I give it a 4 because I'm not sure he understood the absurdist images are dreams."
5,Can't go wrong with Maisy,"I can't recommend Lucy Cousins enough. Maisy is wonderful. I have a 4 year old and 2 year old who were both introduced to Maisy around 1. They both to this day love Maisy and her friends. Maisy's Rainbow Dream is great. I also highly recommend Maisy Big, Maisy Small.Peace and Enjoy"
1,Unfinished Work,"This is a very difficult read. The authors present us with about 187 chapters of documents written between 1884 to 2002 from hundreds of different authors. This may be a fine set of reference for anybody who wishes to write a ""good"" documentary history of Welfare. However, its presentatation is disjointed. Wonderful history books present us with relevant facts and insights on a particular subject. The chapters of good history books are written by one or two authors which yield a smooth, telling of the story. This is more like a compilation of good raw material and references which must precede a history book. The authors started a promising project. They retrieved valuable reference documents. Afterwards, they simply copied their reference documents. The authors forgot to write a book."
4,From Motorhead to Fastway....,"....Fast Eddie Clark went from the extreme hard rock or Motorhead to the bluesy Fastway. I like both bands.If you like ZZ Top & Rory Gallagher,then you might like Fastway. I bought this because the best of CD titled ""The Collection"" didn't have my favorite Fastway song on it called TELL ME. That song was released as a single & the video was played all over TVs in the mid 80s.Worth the price of admission."
2,Well....,"There's no real reason for this two-for-one. For my nickel, all the Fastway anyone would want is on the debut record. Lemmy probably laughed his boil off when he heard ""All Fired Up"". All riffs and no substance do not a record make."
1,"""BOOTPUNK"" review says it all.","I have to agree with the VERY FIRST review posted here...this ""little"" book is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! Almost ALL of the KAKE books are STILL available in larger editions, so why this tiny and cheap looking edition instead of treating the art of Tom of Finland with the RESPECT IT DESERVES!"
4,heart thumping,"Just happened to see this item on Amazon. Had never heard about Tom or his work. Took a chance and ordered the book.Just one word should describe it - MINDBLOWING !Although the art and line drawings are repetitive, the way the whole story is conceptualised and brought to life in the drawings is indeed amazing.Am a fan now and forever, have also ordered a couple of his other books.The only reason I give a four star rating is that the Book could have been published in one volume and the size and layout could also have been slightly larger, which would have enhanced the visual appeal.All in all a book worth keeping and prying into as and when the need ""ARISES""!"
1,Two thumbs down!!!,"I was going to pre-order this collection because I'm a big fan of Tom's. Thank God I waited for the reviews. Indeed, when this collection was first announced, you couldn't check the dimensions and the price sounded too good to be true. Now I know why... Amazon, please pass your customers' feedback to Taschen and, hopefully, they'll resize this collection to a larger format (letter size would be great). Instead of shrinking cult books like ""The Art of Pleasure"" (which I proudly own in its original HUGE format), they sure can bring this collection to a respectable size. In the meantime, though I'm dying to complete my Kake collection (I've purchased some books directly through TOF Foundation Store), I'd rather wait until something worthy comes out."
1,Old Celtic Romaances,I could not just get into this book. I tried and tried but could not hold my interest for me to continue.
1,Romance book,I had a hard time getting into this book so I never finished reading the entire book and removed it.
3,"This is good, but Singable Songs is much better","This is a collection of Raffi's 5th, 6th and 7th albums. Singable Songs is a collection of 1st, 2nd and 3rd albums. (The middle album is ""Baby Beluga"", which is great but for some reason stands alone!) While I hate to be one of those fans that says the early stuff is better, I think with Raffi it's really true! The first 3 albums (especially the first two) just have a fun spirit and fantastic song selection that was never quite matched in the rest of his catalog. Don't let this dissuade you from getting Box of Sunshine, just make sure you've bought the Singable Songs collection (and Baby Beluga) first, because those early titles are bound to become favorites of the whole family!"
5,He is the best,"Even my husband and I enjoy singing along to his songs. Raffi is classic for children, there is no one current who even comes close!"
1,Feast on your wallet,"Feast 1 was a great and somewhat original movie. Feast 2 has lots of gore, a couple of jokes, poinless violence, and ummm...well not much else. The story is pretty much non existent, the acting lets just say I have seen better in a 70's porn movie, and the directing, I guess he was asleep. An all around waste of time. Don't make a sequel, if you can't put in a little effort."
1,Feast II: Sloppy Sequel,"Take everything you love about the first feast movie and throw it out, all resemblances of horror movie are taken away. It does everything wrong and dumbs the movie down more than was needed. I didn't expect a classic like the first, but there was maybe one notable kill, one or two funny lines, and 80 minutes of movie I didn't want to watch. You know a horror movie can't be good when the ""best"" characters are a pair a wrestling midgets. This isn't supposed to be a comedy, I loved the first and was greatly disappointed by this sequel."
1,One of the worst movies ever made,"To put it bluntly, this is a move made for immature drunk college guys. It's postively abysmal. An absolute slap in the face to the first movie, which was passably good compared to this pile of feces.No fan of horror movies should ever give this even a passing glance."
1,complete letdown !!!!,"part one was an unexpected gem of a indie horror movie. fast paced, hot women and decent fx. to add, it didnt take itself too seriously. here it was an utter mess. it tried to do too much or wanted to be ''evil dead 3'' too badly.this picks up minutes after part 1 ended. i like when sequels do that. the sister of the chick who was going to rob the bar is searching for her. sister (whos the boss of an all girl biker gang) stubbles across the old bartender and the stupidty begins.this is a much better comedy than horror movie but its even short on laughs. a better title would have been ''least''."
2,So bad it's just...bad,"Horror junkies know that films in the genre fall into 3 basic categories: great; implausibly silly but entertaining; and so bad it's not even good, just bad. ""Feast 2"" falls squarely into the last category. There is no rhyme or reason to this movie. Story arcs often go nowhere (the Honey Pie storyline for one) and there is no tension whatsoever -- just lots of gore. Now, I'm never one to dismiss the power (and fun) of good blood-splattering, but the film doesn't even deliver on that level. There's just lots of red goo and meal worms for the sake of...I'm not sure what the sake for. Additionally, the movie dragged; I kept waiting for something of interest but there wasn't anything. Continuity was also bad: actors covered in slime one minute and looking pretty damn dry the next. While the original was an entertaining slice of nastiness, this was a complete letdown."
1,THIS MOVIE IS TOTAL CRAP!!!!!,"Ok, I loved the first FEAST movie. This piece of crap was just out of line and stupid. I have seen troma movies better then this! Everyone in this movie is a total jerk and by the end of the movie your begging to see them all die ( but you don't!! ) the movie just ends. that's it. This movie is nothing but the F-word over and over until you can't stand hearing it anymore. NOt much Gore, bad story, stupid actors, it never shows the monsters, etc. Stick with the first Feast movie and save your money, unless you want to watch 2 hours of monster farts, semen, and snot. This movie is pure bad taste!!! Any 4th grader could have made a lame movie better then this trash."
3,The title says it all,"Sequels are just that never as good, but this one is not too bad it goes down hill with each one but hey I love Feast and so no matter how many there are I will watch them."
5,very funny,"many ppl say its not as good as the first one, but its totally different. its spllatter fest at its best, if you like Evil Dead, Machine Girl, Braindead, Bad Taste its a must for you. Very absurd and extremely gory. Even a funny vomiting scene is here - i though it wont be ever made again since Bad Taste."
4,Holy Freakin Cow!,"This is the sequel to the movie feast. This is even more perverted and over the top than the 1st one. The violence, nudity, comedy, and absurdity is so overwhelming that when the movie ends you will probably be in shock. There is a lot to tell about this sequel, but chances are if are reading this review then you probably saw Feast 1. If you did then imagine everything in that movie to the 10th power. If you can do that you may have an idea of what this is like. If you liked the first film then you should like this one too. It's a gamble though. This movie doesn't make a lot of sense, but that's not really its purpose. It's for entertainment. I think that it has the entertainment aspect pretty much covered."
4,"It Is what it is, a fun, at times completely random good time","Anyone who even begins to take this movie seriously has completely missed the point. This movie is great for a night with friends, drinking/smoking what have you. It's pure camp, and makes fun of a lot of films that try to take themselves far to serious. This is a super obscene dramomidy. if you're looking for a scare you're looking in the wrong place. If you're looking for a film that has fun with itself and the genre, with over the top and sometimes extremely ""obscene"" moments, then this film is defiantly for you. It's defiantly worth it, and I can't wait for Feast 3."
1,The first DVD i've ever thrown away..,"Absolutely terrible.I was a big fan of FEAST and couldn't comprehend how the same team made FEAST 2. The monsters are no longer scary, the effects look cheap, the acting is terrible and unless you like vile and ugly women vomiting on one another do NOT watch this movie. It's more than a waste of your 90 minutes.Throwing this movie away was an insult to the garbage can."
4,oooooover the top!,"I really enjoyed the first FEAST - but this was amazing! Wow, talk about over the top! If you want to be critical, you could pull just about any movie to pieces - but horror? This movie is fun. This movie is gory, offensive, far fetched, etc. This is a movie for company - beer and pizza for sure."
1,Ruined by the hosts,"There are some funny songs on this CD. Unfortunately, Bob & Tom decided to repeatedly insert the sound themselves laughing stupidly at the obvious punchlines in the songs, and totally wrecked them as a consequence.Good producers of compilation albums know that it's about the music, not about the themselves, and in the process show how clever they are by pulling it together (see ""A John Waters Christmas"" for the perfect example). Bob & Tom aren't smart enough to understand this.They leave the Dr. Duke Tomatoe songs alone, but those are available elsewhere. A couple of other tracks escape the sophomoric giggles of Bob & Tom, but not enough to salvage this mess from being completely unlistenable. Save your money. Don't buy it."
4,This is cool,"The Departure is another of the new British bands who are yet to crash upon American shores. In fact this is an import and not released here yet. They have a little techno sound. They have a hard rock sound too. They vocals are really British sounding. In other words, they are probably more like The Fall. In songs like ""Only Human"" there are heavy guitar riffs. It's a little like The Bravery. The song that most people have heard is ""All Mapped Out"" which could be a song by The Bravery too. They are maybe like The Bravery if they could play their instruments. ""Lump In My Throat"" reminds me of Echo and the Bunnymen. In many of their songs, The Departure have good dynamics. They have good surf guitar riffs. It's a cool sound overall. It doesn't really sound like anyone else out there right now. They might be a good band to see live."
5,heard it on the x,"mind blowing show, every song is tight and powerful, if you loved zz before mtv got a hold of them then this is for you! its even better played at maximun volume!"
2,SO not worth it!,"It looks cute enough. The picture does it justice, but this didn't last us 9 months! It took HOURS to put together...and I am pretty good at that stuff;) Once together, it was fine for a short while, but the tiny screws that hold the table together completely come out of the wood...unfixable. It's a shame. A simple redesign of the table would make this a charming set. Complete waste of my money and broke my daughters heart when it fell apart.:("
1,Have you got part 2 of this title?,Hi. This book is a 2-part book. I got part 1 but looking for part 2. Did you have it? Thanks. Ronaldo Martinez
3,24079 Pet Cafe Waterer,"After the Deluxe Fresh Flow Pet Fountain waterer I'd used for a long time finally gave out, I decided to try a basic gravity-flow watering bowl for my two kitties. I mean, did they really need filtered, flowing water, or was that all for me? They've used the Pet Cafe Waterer for about a month now, and I'm not happy with it. They don't seem to drink as much as they used to, and the water begins to look a bit murky awfully fast. But the topper is (forgive the pun) the problem with filling the container. The advertisement states it is easy to fill, but it's not. The top opening is tiny, and hard to fill without splashing and runover, unless you fill very slowly. For some reason, instead of providing a good-sized opening with a screw cap, the designer just made a cute little tophat for the container. Cosmetically nice, functionally dumb. I am ordering a new Deluxe Fresh Flow Pet Fountain today--they're worth it!"
5,Happy Gardener,The time comes when the rain does not fall and the gardener must water. I have had many a hose but this one takes the cake. Love it!!!
5,More Fun Than a Real Western BBQ,"Waited for this film with a funny bone type hunger. The film lives up to all my expectations and then some. Truly an American Comedy Treasure. You have to ride a long dusty trail to find anything like it. Carl and the cast let you know they are having fun, so you just join in. I recommend this for your video library with out a doubt!"
3,an excellent guide to practical management,"I was startled to read an earlier online review of this book becasue it was so much at varience with my own thoughts about Dr. Bersteins book. I am a psycholgist with a Ph.D. and 25 years experience working in clinical settings and I have never before encountered a book on conduct disorders that was so clearly the work of an experienced clinician and so deeply rooted in his experience. Bernstein's clinical examples could have come from my office or those of other psychologists I know and work with. His suggestions and illlustrations of his work with his patients was both reassuring and familiar as well as stimulating and provocative. If you chave to go out and work in the trenches with oppositional and conduct disordered, Dr. Bernstien's book is a very handy item to have along"
2,This set of shanties is too polished.,"I have been looking for a good CD of traditional sea shanties. This is not it. The songs are too polished for my taste. Although the songs are cleanly performed, they lack any true feeling of authenticity. All songs are accompanied by instruments, none a cappella. Too bad."
1,Ptooie!,"Compared to Volume 1 of the set, Volume 2 is a sad disappointment. While some songs are done well, they lack the authentic feel of Volume 1, and they just plain butcher a couple of pieces. I've always heard ""Spanish Ladies"" to the tune we use for ""Streets of Larado"" - I don't know where they got the one they use. The ""Mingulay Boat Song"" is traditionally a fo'cle(?sp?)song, sung by sailors in their off-watch time for their own entertainment. These people do it as a work song with a yo-heave-ho! beat. The instrumentals aren't bad, though, and I want to research the story behind ""The Catalpa"" (still another song done to the tune of ""Rosin, the Beau,"" this time about Irish transportees)."
2,Just old...,"Guia Roji's state maps usually are fairly old (mostly from before 1997) and the Oaxaca map isn't an exception. Using this map you soon will find out that the ""Super Carretera"" from Puebla to Oaxaca City is missing; important roads just don't exist; the Oaxaca Valley just is a jumble of illegible information. Stick with the free maps you get at every tourist information office and you're better off finding your way around!"
5,Slamin remix,Yo gangsters. Y'all heard this I'm sure. You got to buy it. It's one of the first tracks on my next compilation CD. It's the slammin remix that rocks. Keep you nobbin your head for 5 minutes. Excellent track.
5,great story,"This is a beautiful book about a relationship between a grandmother, Tzedyll, and granddaughter, Shayna. It is also a romance, a story of friendship, and a story of conflicts between generations. Shayna is a Jewish lesbian, and this book is on opportunity to learn from her perspective. The book starts out a little slowly, but soon becomes very engaging. Newman is very skilled at characterization. You will very likely become emotionally involved with these characters."
5,The second of this writer's how-to books I've bought,Ronald Tobias makes how to construct a plot as clear as the antagonist's motivations. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is learning to write fiction. It's a sound and solid investment in your talent.
5,screenwriting class,"this book was recomended by my instructor in screenwriting class, i bought it during the learning stages, and i couldn't put it down, anyone who wants to become a successful writer, must get this book and read it thoroughly..and i guarantee, it will change your thinking and the way you write....i was all over the place, until i learned to rope it all in the coral, and then create my story? it really helps you to focus on the plot and the characters involved, a must for any screenwriter, who wants to become a success. it helps you get organized, and shows you how to organize your thoughts before you put it down on paper. a must."
5,The ONLY book on writing that helps in a practical way,"Ronald B. Tobias must have written this book with me in mind. I've published and edited non-fiction for years, but now trying my hand at writing fiction. Scary! I usually advise people to stay away for books on how to write, believing it can't be taught. But Tobias chops through the undergrowth and reveals very practical information on structuring your work.Almost all of the books I've worked on as inhouse editor suffer from lack of structure. Intelligent people seem clueless when it comes to shaping their manuscripts and making them commercially viable. 20 Master Plots offers much more than plot ideas. It succinctly puts forth a wealth of information on how to think about what you're doing and where you are going with your work. I'm so jazzed by this book, I woke up after three hours' sleep to write this review and get back to my novel. Exciting!"
5,The only how-to-write book you need,"I had been trying to pen my first novel for eleven years, but, in spite of all my reading of other writing books as well as immersing myself in the kind of fiction I was trying to create, I didn't have the critical acumen to define how to do it. This book tells you what you want to do, how to achieve it, and why it's important. Tobias does this with clarity, authority, grace, and humor. This book gave me everything I needed to write my book. Thank you, Ron!"
5,There's no new story ideas under the sun... but this will allow your story to be coherent at least,"""20 Master Plots"" is a good reference book for budding authors. Each of the plots is given a thorough run-through, with ""real"" (story) world examples of well-known tales. Some plots even include a mini-checklist at the end of the chapter to provide consistance with the plot listed to your story. I have found with my stories, they have run-on plots into many different areas (i.e. starts out a mystery and ends up a revenge plot) - this book helped clear up the context to remain true to the writing. No more crappy cross-plot tales from my pen!"
4,More than a how-to....,"I was very pleased to find that this ""how-to"" guide is actually a very well written introduction to and analysis of the major plots found in all storytelling media in our culture.The writing is crisp, enjoyable, accessible, yet also deep with critical insights valuable to any writer or wannabe.I've already recommended it to several friends without hesitation! Read, learn, apply, enjoy!"
1,"Big on promises, short on delivery","I'm afraid this book has very little to recommend it. Not only is it out of touch with classical and contemporary literature on its subject of choice, all the master structures described aren't really plot structures either, but rather smaller narrative ""motifs"". And where are all the illustrative, helpful examples from literature and film to flesh out the descriptions? Probably in some other book.For a well-researched, expansive, and empirically grounded take on basic plot structures, I recommend Christopher Booker's ""The Seven Basic Plots""."
2,"Basic, formulaic","Bottom line, this book was dull. These twenty plots are a better subject for an essay or paper than an entire book. That the author has to say about each of the twenty plots could be summed up in three lines: The protagonists goal, the relationships between two or three main characters, and the hook. He makes a few good points about plots of the mind and plots of the body, but ultimately it is mostly a space-filler. Shiny package, enticing structure, and while not terrible, this book is short on content."
3,Somewhat Helpful,"I bought this book, and it's a good one to refer to for a look at different plots. But I still need more."
2,Didn't like it,"This book focused on the plots...hey guess what, I already wrote a book...and you know what? It had about 12 of the 20 plots in it! Give me a break! Get Self Editing for Fiction Writers, The First Five Pages, How to Write a Damn Good Novel or many others out there.SUGGESTION: Two books that helped me out, more than any other, On Writing by Stephen King and Elements of Style By Strunk and White. Read those as well as this book, and you should have enough tools in your belt to get the job done."
3,A worthwhile struggle to get through,"I've read many, many books on the topic of writing, trying to gather advice to launch a writing career of my own. I can assure you that this book is one of those worth reading: it contains special insights on plot types that I haven't seen elsewhere, and I found enlightening.Having said that, this book isn't terribly well structured. Large swaths of it proved boring, repetitive, and even worse for a book I might've wanted to use as a reference book, unstructured: sometimes chapters will be segmented with headers (""Act One"" ""Act Two"" ""Act Three"" ""Checklist""), frequently they will not, and it will just be a long ramble.It's probably the result of a brilliant plot-writer but merely adequate essay-writer writing a book. And the end product is a book that, if you want to know more about plot writing, you SHOULD read, but you should also be prepared to slog through."
4,Organization and Inspiration,#1 - This book will help you to come up with ideas to turn into screenplays.#2 - It will also help develop those ideas into a sensible and interesting story.It's worth the money.
2,Angry Teens,"I ordered this book hoping for some concrete answers/assistance in helping my angry teen cope with his emotions. This book is filled with stories and examples of other angry teens but offers little in the area of realistic suggetions. Here is another professional who wastes time describing the symptoms and is unsure of the cure except to blame parents for their kids problems, i.e. an angry parent makes an angry teen. I suggest ""Parent in Control"" by G. Bodenhamer for some real help in dealing with defiant, rebellious teens. Good luck!"
2,FELE Studey Guide,I have encountered numerous errors in the practice tests. I will contact the publisher to see if there is a correction suppliment available. I will update the review as appropriate.
3,"Works, but doesn't fit as good as it should","The muffler and muffler pipes fit good, but the hangers aren't in the same spots as the Ford muffler I replaced. They are close, but not quite the same. So it pulls and twists the rubber isolators. and one looks like it wants to slide off the hanger on the muffler. But it gets the job done."
1,WARNING!! - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"We set this outdoor bench up on a brand new brick paver patio that had been installed 3 weeks prior. It rained & all of the stain ran off the bench onto the brick pavers & stained & ruined them. It was awful!!They must have used a very cheap stain. I have never experienced anything like this by any other outdoor furniture. Now it will cost me money to replace the brick pavers that this destroyed. If you value your patios and/or clothing, I would highly recommend not purchasing this product."
4,east to set-up,This bench was easy to set up and so far is comfortable. If you have longer legs you may not think so though as the seat is short. But I like it alot
1,This entry is wrong,"Something is wrong with this entry. Symphony of a Thousand is Mahler no.8, not 9. Parts of this entry look like it is more for a VHS than an audio disc."
1,Fake,"I was very happy to find this perfum as Ralph Lauren has descontiued this perfum for a while now. It was very dissapointing to receive a product that is not even near the original, it smells strongly like alcohol."
4,Mmmm,"Great floral scent! kind of strong at first, but it settles in and becomes a warm pretty scent, i have gotten many compliments from guys and even my boyfriend asked if he could smell my stomach because that's where i sprayed RL Cool!"
3,Polished and Heartfelt,"Audio A is back, and while this cd has some great moments, it doesn't top ""Worldwide"". This disc has more of a worship feel to it and really reflects this band's maturity and longevity. ""Clap Your Hands"" kicks off this disc in true AA fashion and other stand outs are ""Until My Heart Caves In"" and ""Starting Over"". I particularly like their remake of ""Your Love Keeps Lifting Me Higher""! This cd really shows off their excellent muscianship with the only real disappoinment being ""King"". The song itself is uplifting in its lyrics and delivery but falls victim to the same formula (structure and chord progression)that has driven the ""worship song"" format that has become all too popular lately. Worship songs are great, but some diversity is needed from all the ""cookie cutter"" songs hitting the airwaves. If you are new to AA, grab ""Worldwide"" and ""Hit Parade"". That's a solid start to this amazing band and their passionate ministry of music!"
3,Still my favorite group!,"It has been a few years since AA has come out with a new CD. It would have been hard to match their last one, Worldwide, which is still their best one to me. The vocals, music and guitars are still 5 star. The lyrics on UMHCI lack some of the power of prior CD's but there are still 4 or 5 songs that make this CD very worth while.My favorite song is ""KING"". Other fav's are UNTIL MY HEART CAVES IN, STARTING OVER, and LIGHT OF THE SUN.If AA is new to you, you may want to check out other CD's. My gavorite of all, as I said is still Worldwide. Number 2 is Some Kind of Zombie; 3rd is Bloom; 4th would be their ""best of"" Hit Parade which has most of their great early songs plus two very good new songs I haven't seen anywhere else."
3,"Great album, Audio-a's last so...a must have.","The album has very nice songs and the great sound of audio-a, sadly mark's voice is noticeably fading. I have also the farewell concert from hawaii and it was heart breaking for me, an Audio A fan to see them say goodbye. Songs like ""king"" and ""undefeated"" sound incredibly good. I hope Mark's voice get better so they can reunite and rock again."
4,15 years and still got it!,"Until My Heart Caves In is going to be the second to last Audio A. album, as the band is calling it quits after Adios in 2006. That said, they appear to be building up to something wonderful because this CD is fantastic! This album is very genuine; no cheese, no pomp or circumstance, just straightforward, honest rock. My personal favorite is the title track, though critics seem to be going nuts for ""King."" I also found their cover of ""Your Love Keeps Lifting Me Higher"" to be a unique take on an Otis Redding classic. Overall, very nicely done, and I for one will miss these guys terribly."
5,THIS CD ROCKS,This cd is one of the best Christian Rock CD's out this year!King and Clap Your Hands and the title track are rocking!Definetly pick this one up!
2,Bad to the bone,"Here it is, the stuff I try to warn others about so they don't do the same stupid thing I did: purchase any circuit party album. Take your pic, each and every one of them is the worst that techno or dance has to offer, [boomboomboomboomboomboom] with barely a change in beat. Yes, there are some vocals, but not very good ones, the beats that are there are just awful. This is a very boring series, and not worth a penny."
3,Not one of the best circuit party CDs,"This has some decent tracks (Massiv's ""Who Am I"" and Vibration Inc.'s ""Dr. Drum"") but compared to the Cds before this one, it falls short. Volume 5 is MUCH better. I hope the next one shines above those behind it."
3,Good for beginners,"The DVD has some good exercises, but it moves slow for someone who has been doing yoga and stretching exercises for 2 decades."
3,Yoga for the Rest of Us.,"I like this Yoga DVD, but it is too long. It is easy to do. I like all of the movements that she does, for every part of the body. I just don't like that it is one and a half hours long. If she could shorten her DVD's I would buy them. She waste to much time explaining things, also. That is just my opinion."
4,Good instructions/unhappy participants,"The instructor was very easy to follow and the moves were not difficult. I wish she had been the only person in the video. Neither the man or the woman doing the movements were very happy to be there. The man appeared to be anorexic - his chest was caved in and when they did the shoulder moves it was almost impossible to watch.The other woman in the video appeared to only be particapating because there was someone off screen holding her mother hostage. She did not smile once through out the entire instruction.I agree there should be people to help demonstrate the movemments at different levels, but next time have a couple of people who want to participate."
1,Eh.,"I was looking for exercise but have bad knees. This nearly put me to sleep. Maybe this would be good for someone wanting to de-stress, but this is way too slow-moving to count as exercise."
4,Yoga DVD,A DVD that will be well used. The service was well recieved it got to me right on time. Thank You.
4,Yoga I can manage,"I have always wanted to do yoga, but suffer from arthritis. How nice to find a dvd that caters to people like me! I found the exercises challenging yet within my abilities."
2,look somewhere else,"I purchased this DVD even though it had mixed reviews. I wish I had purchased something else. Peggy Cappy obviously knows her material. I think the problem here is primarily with the editing and design. It would have been helpful to have an instructional section, followed by a practice section which you could turn on to work through. Instruction is mixed up with practice. With all her talking, the DVD is 110 minutes long! I don't have that amount of time, and constantly fast forwarding is really not user friendly. (The last portion of Sun Salutations abruptly cut off, as mentioned by another reviewer.) Her two helpers looked less than thrilled to be on the DVD! Come on - show a little enthusiasm! The lack of music, while not critical, is a legitimate complaint.I won't give the DVD away, since I need to work on flexibility to counter my osteoarthritis. But if you are looking for a program, look elsewhere."
2,Too easy and limited,"Far too easy, even for someone with arthritis. Moves much too slowly and few yoga poses are used. Less talking and more doing is advised."
5,Easy Yoga for Arthritis,This is a very good Yoga CD Peggy Cappy is super All her tapes are excellent. She is so easy to follow and listen too.
3,Easy Yoga for Arthritis,I found several yoga exercises that I could use everyday to gently strengthen my muscles and keep them stretched to be more supple.
5,Yoga for arthritics,Love this video. It is divided in sections for people who don't have time to do the entire video in one session. The stretches are wonderful. I feel so much better. Love it !
5,Yoga for the Rest of Us,"I have tried many Yoga cds and this is the first one that I can actually say that I have continued to do. Peggy explains and demonstrates the Yoga poses in three different stages (beginner, average, and advanced) so that there is something everyone can do. In addition, in this cd there is not as much down time as there has been in the other two videos I have by her. My whole body feels better after I do this cd."
1,Too much talking,I am an exercise enthusiasts. I'm sure I'll be able to use it when I get older. For me there is too much talking and very little exercising. I would have sent it back if I had known before opening it.
3,Just so-so,"Have taken yoga classes in the past and have viewed other yoga dvds. This one, in my opinion, is only fair. Some of the postures and poses are done quickly and are difficult for a senior with arthritis."
2,Needs editing,"This goes for nearly two hours straight. Who is going to do it and not get bored? Why not break it into small programs - with breaks - for specific problem areas, rather than standing/seated/reclining poses? Most Yoga DVDs do a circular program that addresses warmups, upper body, lower body, overall movements so you feel you have done a complete session of 30 - 45 minutes, with maybe two different complete programs."
5,Nice product.,This looks to e the perfect additon to our heath regime. I bought several more for family. I recommend it!
5,YOGA!!!,Love this DVD - been wanted to get into yoga for quite sometime - now I have. Peggy's yoga techniques are very kind to your body - particularly when you are out of shape!! This program is also helpful with your mental well being - I urge everyone to get into some type of yoga if you want flexibility and relaxation of your mind. Thanks Amazon!!!!! Thanks Peggy!!!!!
4,Pretty good,Some of the poses are a bit rough on my old joints. Most are just about right. Good thing about yoga is every movement can be modified.
2,"Does not include a ""workout""","This dvd shows yoga postions for arthritics, but the pace is very slow and it does not include a ""workout"" section, where after learning the positions one would follow Peggy through a workout. That makes this DVD obsolete after about 3 or 4 viewings."
4,good dvd,The dvd was what I expected as I had seen this person & her workout programs on PBS. easy to follow
1,Waste of money!,"I'm 35 and bought this video after reading other people's reviews. I had hurt my back and hip, so my doctor had recommended yoga. This video was so boring and not like any other yoga video or class that I have taken! The video looks like it was made back in the 80's, Peggy speaks extremely slow like the viewer is stupid. I wound up turning it off after 10 minutes. This was such a waste of money!"
3,Easy Yoga for Arthritis,"Sorry, no real opportunity since Christmas to evaluate this product. I hope to give it a fair rateing soon. As of now, my review would not be applicable."
1,where is it now ???,I just remembered that I bought this for my husband for a Christmas present - at the recommendation of my sister. I do not know where it got to. Don't think it ever got viewed! Oh well!
3,Wrong purchase,As I bought the DVD from the American website I was unable to play it on my UK player sio have returned it.Thanks for the help from Amazon staff in telling me how to do this for a refund. (Which I hope is in process.)
1,Didn't Play Properly on our DVD Player,"Unfortunately, I returned this DVD for a refund. It was received on schedule, but did not play without stalling on our DVD player. It was as if the DVD disc was too light, or something. I could hear a strange swishing noise in the DVD player. Other DVDs play just fine, so something was wrong with this disc."
4,Fantastic Dragonlance background,"For all fans of the Heros of the Lance, this book is a must read. It delves into the birth and childhood of Tanis Half-Elven. Accentuating on the intrigue and politics of the Qualinesti Elves. It goes into great detail on how and why Flint Fireforge and Tanis became friends, and also gives details as to the events that lead to Tanis' mixed emotions about his homeland that was brought up in the Other dragonlance books. Even to the non-DL reader, this book is a real page turner, with action and magic and politics and murder. I highly reccommend."
2,This series leaves a lot to be desired,"The Meetings Sextet's have not been what I expected at all. I was really disappointed in the series. Although I will say that it gives you a birds eye view of the humble beginnings of our favorite Heroes and Villans of the War of the Lance, Flint, Sturm, Caramon, et. al. I rated it lowly due to the fact that the stories put me to sleep, rather than keep me in good attention. If you want to know more about the characters it is a must read, if you are not interested do not pick up on the series."
4,"Loyal to the DragonLance World, but unique","I cannot compare this to any of the other Sextet novels (as I haven't read them), but this was definitely a worth-while read. An interesting plot on its own and well placed within the DragonLance world, it gives definition and strength to Tanis' and Flint's characters. For some reason, it felt laid back to me, not the usual tension found within DL, but at the time that was welcome."
4,Kindred Spirited,Kindred Spirits is an excellent book. The storyline is rich and well thought out. The original Dragonlance characters Flint and Tanis are very compatable as friends. My only complaint is that it is very elf biased which can get very boring (Especially with elven customs).
4,Interesting... helps you understand the other books better,"I liked this book a lot... I always liked Tanis and Flint, and it was great to see why Tanis was so sore about his past and Qualinesti. I didn't give it 5 stars because I think the author should've used a faster pace and included Tanis' and Kitiara's relationship... if you read Dark Heart, which is Kit's background, you still don't get to read about those two! Aaarrrgghhh!"
2,TOO small,"It's as advertised but this size is way too small except for anorexics who BBQ. Look for 15"" version elsewhere."
2,Don't be fooled by the title,"*Disclaimer: This is not a review of content but rather it's presentation and organization.*To put it simply, I was expecting to get a CD that I'd pop into the drive and get an animated menu to quickly choose from all the available stats, information, etc. Except that there is only a bunch of folders with Microsoft Word documents in them! An encyclopedia is supposed to be a quick reference, but this...this is just a waste of time. I only bothered looking at ONE of the documents and it *was* well written, but I mean, there isn't even a SEARCH mechanism or index. To find information you'd have to print out over 100 pages of text which is a waste of time to me. I thought I'd be getting a CD with an interactive menu, etc. I mean I did pay [money] for this!"
4,"College Football Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition",This is a very thorough compliation of data. It is very well organized and provides easy access to information about all the division 1A teams. It would be nice for a future edition to include division 1AA teams. With the CD-ROM the information is literally at your finger tips.
1,As Young as You Feel,Unfortunately this title has never arrived from Weeping Willow Books. I did send a request to Weeping Willow. I am waiting for either a reply or the above mentioned title. To say the very least I am very disappointed with the servide.
5,SO TRUE TO LIFE!!,"Since I discovered Schleich toy animals about a month ago, I have ordered practically every one I've found on Amazon!! This cute little calf fits PERFECTLY with the momma cow, looking exactly like he's nursing! The momma cow is so life-like that our friend just sat staring at it in his hands one night when we were having a Bible study together! Schleich is the absolute BEST!! Highly recommended!!"
3,ultimate Rock and Roll Collection,"this album was okay for starters, now I have to get looking for more songs of the era, Jim King"
5,Nice collection,"This collection is pretty good - a glass of wine, some decent speakers and you're dancing like you're 14 again."
5,excellent,excellent song selections --- enjoy all of them - brings back memories and excellent dance selections
2,oldies,like the CD BUT this was in the karaoke section so i thought it was KARAOKE. so disappointed but the songs are good for normal cd..
2,can't tell a book from its cover,"I am almost to page 200. This is struggle and the slowest moving book I have seen in a long time. Perhaps I am missing it, but there also does not seem to be a message in here."
1,Disjointed,"This is the first Moon book I read, and it will also be my last. I picked it up at an outlet mall because I liked the cover. The book is basically a series of vignettes involving a lot of different characters so there is no major plot to the book. The few sections with Esmay and Barin were probably the most interesting. Moon was apparently wrapping up a bunch of loose ends from her prior books. Unfortunately, as a whole, it was a big disappointment for me. I guess I would recommend this only for diehard Moon fans."
2,Rather Blah....,"Like the other reviewers I happen to agree this was not up to Ms. Moons' earlier work in this series. The various plots outlined in the book seem fragmented and disjointed, the book would have been more enjoyable if done as a group of short stories. I have read this book on the Baen Web page so I will not be purchasing this in hardback or paperback anytime soon. Sorry, Ms. Moon. You are going to have to do better than this next time."
1,Wait for the paper back,"Or get it from the library. This book is definetly a setup for another sequel, and nowhere near as good as her previous work. I hope she gets back on track in her next book."
2,Came out of the gate strong but slowed towards the finish,"I absolutely loved ""Once a Hero"" and ""Rules of Engagement"" and could not wait to see what Esmay would do next. Instead of climactic battles with the heroine we love, we get weak political fighting, a rushed marriage, shocking revelations that are almost too contrived and a fizzled ending. A disappointment at best but I still read it all the way through. Now its on to the first 3 books in the Heris Serrano series.If you're going to buy this one, find it in a used book store."
2,Too Many Main Characters Spoil the Book,"I was disapointed by this book for two reasons.First: there was very little of Esmay in it, and I kept expecting her to pop up. The book can not be said to have centered on any particular character. In addition some interesting characters were given little time and attention.Second: The story hopped around too much, making in difficult to follow. I would just be getting interested in one situation when BAM! we were half a galaxy away in a totally different situation. I kept expecting all (or most) of the subplots to come together in the end but they never really did.I do look forward to the next book which, I hope will continue the story of Esmay and Barin's adventures. I would like to see the reactions of their families to what they did at the end of the book! I hope Barin gets to meet Esmay's family!"
1,Change of Command- Maybe it was a change in Writers,Elizabeth Moon breaks her run of outstanding books with this group of short stories with no ending in sight. During the first chapter the book outlines a plot worth reading. Then the last chapter barely closes the first. The sub-plots within sub-plots combine to make this the most boring book she has written. I almost thought another writer must have slipped in. However the story line is written in her style. I do not reccomend this book at all.
3,Not up to par - read Rules of Engagement again instead,"This is the latest in E Moons Familias series of Space Opera with humour(with Heris Serrano and Esmay Suiza.) The previous books were Once a Hero & Rules of Engagement both good value and now available in paperback.This books starts lots of threads, with at least three sets of assassins, mutiny and space siege and most of the females from the previous book having to take on greater responsiblities. We lose Brun's father and the whole book is about the Hobart Conselline speakership but suffers from lack of focus though the individual parts are well done. Things are just hotting up when < The End > arrives with most threads unfinished. Really the book is two interlaced half books with little communication. Suggestion - read or reread Rules of Engagement and wait for the next in the series."
2,Half a Book,Having read the previous two books in the Esmay Suiza series I was looking forward to reading this one. After reading the book I was left with an unsatisfied feeling. I reread the book and realized that I felt cheated. It felt like I had read half a book. After a comparison with the previous books I noticed it was shorter and that none of the plot lines seemed to come to a conclusion. If you've read the other books don't waste your money on the hardback. Wait for the paperback. While I'm waiting for the other half of this book to be published I will go back and re-read the Haris Serano series of Familias Regnant books.
2,Disjointed and too many plots,"Elizabeth Moon is a favorite author of mine and I looked forward to the next installment in this series but.... I found the book to be confusing, sluggish and distracting.Not enough time was spent on any one plot and I felt cheated that I didn't get more out of one thread through the storyline. It was a bit overwhelming to juggle all the scenarios and keep them straight. At times, I lost interest.I frequently re-read Moon's other books because the writing is so strong but this novel fell flat."
3,CHANGE OF COMMAND,Excellent sequel and it brought in two new heroes/heroines for the serise. Plot was clear and characters were believeable. Most of us have known people like these. Whets the appetite for more!
3,A bit of Monty Python ?,"I think you have to read the previous books to slot into this one. It does have a lot of characters and needs to be longer. However there is still a degree of thriller writer about Ms Moon. The book does build on earlier characters but one thing is beginning to nag. The Regular Space Navy has had, over the series; mutinies, turncoats, bribery and corruption, criminal elements and disastrous rejuvination techniques. I keep expecting the Monty Python sketch where an admiral declaims to a reporter that, ""There is definitely no canibalism in the Royal Navy"" whilst a rating chews on a leg in the background."
2,First third of a book,"This book reads almost as well as her earlier ones, but there is no unifying theme, plot, or situation. It is a Familias book with a hodge-podge of subplots instead of a Suiza book. Sometimes it is hard to tell which events in one area are happening at the same time as other events in other subplots. It ends so abruptly I got the impression the author had to finish the book in 3 days instead of 6 months. An additional 200 (or more) pages to finish this book would be a great improvement."
2,Set-up but no delivery...,"Well, having read (and re-read) the previous books focusing on Esmay Suiza I was expecting this to be the latest installment in the her ongoing adventures. Silly me. This entire book was a set up for future novels regarding the Familias and (hopefully) Esmay. This was a very frustrating read since it was background and set-up solely. There was no apparent plot or direction. Hopefully all this frustration will be rewarded in future with a new novel which returns to the focus of the previous installments."
2,One Extended Prologue,"With Esmay Suiza on the cover of the book, I was expecting to read a novel with her as the central character. Instead, the book is like an extended prologue, setting up all the events and characters for the next novel. Esmay doesn't have much of a presence in this novel. Each character has short segments within chapters--no character is more important than another. This made it difficult to care much about any of the characters. I wanted to read more about Esmay but Moon was taking a different approach and I suppose you could say that the book was about the Familias Regnant and the changes it was undergoing. It just didn't make very compelling reading for me."
2,A disappointment from one of my favorite authors,"Having read the other reviews posted here, I concur with the other reviewers. This is an intermediate book that badly needs the next in the series to be worth reading. I'm not convinced that the society described is viable, particularly the level of technology required for their ""barbarian"" neighbors, but the series is enjoyable anyway. I hope the next book is up to the standards of Remnant Population and the five previous books in the series."
2,Not her best,"Change of Command suffers from ""interum syndrome"" where a book in the middle of a series has to tie up loose ends and introduce new subplots, but can't seem to create cohesion or a self contained storyline. Many new interesting developements are introduced, but left to dangle. If Moon can come back and write a good sequel, this uninspired volume might be seen in a better light. Best to reserve judgement.Sachie"
1,Change of Command,"I'm *so* glad that my local library had this book available to checkout - I would have been very annoyed to have bought it in hardcover.The book starts off well, with an interesting whodunit? of who ordered Speaker's murder but quickly disolved into a series of plots that seemed to have little to do with each other.And just when things seemed to be wrapping up, <THE END> arrives, leaving one to go HUH? what happened?I'll buy this book when its sequel (actually the rest of the book) shows up."
2,Disappointing Space Opera,"This is an extremely disappointing follow-up to Rules of Engagement. Moon makes the BIG mistake of thrusting a faceless cast of thousands in our faces instead of focusing on the main characters from her previous two novels in this series. I liked the first two books because Esmay was a brash and courageous young woman with an interesting back story. Here, she is a mere decoration that is as important as a flyspeck on the wall of the Familias Regnant (think I got that right).Save your money and run for the hills."
3,"Piatigorsky is stately in the concerto, Munch is mediocre in the Eighth Sym.","This RCA reissue doesn't do justice to Gregor Piatigorsky, a giant among cellists, who sounds a bit old and tired here late in his career. Munch gives him slow tempos in the first and last movments, perhaps out of consideration--or maybe the cellist sees the Dvorak concerto as a stately work. He certainly plays it that way, with a soulful, rich tone and plenty of rubato.The pairing is a mediocre Dvorak Eighth under Munch, who simply conducts one bar after the other. He seems to evince little interest in Dvorak's Czech style, and there's almost no attempt at expression. The BSO sensed when Munch was on autopilot, and here they play carelessly, not always in tune and with nothing like their famous refinement. This recording was better left in the vault."
3,Great work out,"This a great work out, the body sculpting is particularly good. I gave it 3 stars because Kathy sounds like she is reading cue cards, so that really put me off."
4,"Good mix of exercises. Only complaint, too much talking.","Worth adding to your collection, especially at this Amazon price! Kathy has always been one of my favorites. She does a great job explaining her moves, and keeps a smile on her face!"
2,Just Okay,"I am a huge Kathy Smith fan, but I did not like this nearly as much as her other workouts. I found the lower body workout to be a bit boring--the music was way to mellow. I didn't like the introductions before each segment and I found the pace to be too slow. Also, Kathy seemed to be missing her usual energy. For toning, I would instead recommend her Lift Weights to Lose Weight, Volume 1.However, I did enjoy the cardio segment, which is why I gave the dvd two stars. It's a nice workout if you don't have a lot of time. It gets you moving and is a good pace."
4,Amazing Book,"This was a required read in the christian high school I attended. It is a fiction novel that takes the facts life of Christ in the gospels and ads fiction to all the details. It begins by following the life of a Roman family and their young son and his slave. This son ends up being one of the soldiers to crucify Jesus. The robe of Jesus at his crucifiction is gambled for and this man ends up with it. It is a powerful book about how this robe changed his life and how he is trying to unlock the mystery of the Robe and ends up having his life completly changed by this man Jesus. I found that the life of Jesus became more real to me reading this book, than ever before. Such an amazing view on Jesus and how he touched people. It is a must read. Don't waste your time on watching the movie they made many years ago. It isn't worth watching. This book is one to keep in your library to have your children and grandchildren read."
4,Fun but a bit difficult,"I have to compare this one to Code Veronica in the resident evil series. The graphics, like Veronica, are great and the overall story is excellent and the presentation is great. The one problem is the difficulty, it's just a little too hard. I kept getting stuck on certain sequences and found it really tiresome, and time consuming, to get past them.That is the only thing that stopped this game from being a classic, a game should be enjoyable not so difficult you become bored with it."
5,I Loved it !,"Since I like the Resident Evil Series and I'm a Fan of Horror Movies, I decided to give it a Try ... and I loved it !The Fact that you can play this in Co-op Mode is also a Plus for me and I've missed it on a lot of good Games.The Controls are easy, the Gameplay a blast, the Interaction between the Characters is Fun and I liked the Fact that you can choose between the Characters when the Need arises ... although I stuck with one the whole Game through.I liked the Graphics and the ""scary"" Factor is not bad at all ... gets your Adrenalin pumping. Yes, it is Somewhat of a ""Slasher Movie"" type Game, but that's just another Part that makes it so much Fun, because it's done well.It's hard enough to be challenging, but not so hard that you get frustrated. It was well worth the Try ... you won't be disappointed !"
2,"What Potential, and yet a Failure","The storyline in and of itself is an interesting, Silent Hill-ish, storyline. I have no problems with the storyline. What gets me is the fact that it has terrible physics. First. It had much to offer, but the very fact that the camera angles are naught, well then, you get the idea. Camera angle manipulation is very important, at least for me, because by using camera angles, you can see and do things (like examining clues, studying hallways, combat, etc.). But when you can't, like this game, it is hard to work the game. Second, the use of tools, healing potions, etc. is also very complicated. You have to do hit buttons while trying not to get killed. But usually you do end up getting killed simply because you can't do two things very well at once. That's why I have a problem with this game. Maybe you yourself could work these problems, but I have a hard time doing so."
2,"Great idea, poor recording","I was very much looking forward to this album. For anyone familiar with Mexican romantic music, these two great artists were legends in their time and still are. The selections represent the most famous songs they were known for. The songs of Luis Aguilar were just great! However, this album does a great injustice to Pedro Infante!I was very disappointed by the very poor recording quality of the songs of Pedro Infante. He always displayed a very clear rich and melodic voice. Yet, I frequently had to raise the volume just to be able to hear him.There is really no reason for this, since the two singers were contemporaries. Otherwise, this would have been the perfect album for us fans of these two immortal singers!"
2,Calvinist Universalism,"This book was a disappointment. It takes Calvinist doctrine as a starting point, and the assumptions of this viewpoint strongly slanted Mr. Punt's approach to universalism. There are better books on the market."
3,A little dull,"Entertaining if you are stuck in a house with 30 in of snow outside. Interesting mysteries, but the lead actor is bit dull."
2,Shoddy musicianship masking as edgy alternative pop,"Windsor's attempt to go more accessible falls flatter then their usual overrated releases. I am all for repetition, but on this seemingly catchier release hardly any of it sounds different. Instead, the band seems convinced that layering any cheap melody and bland vocal on top of a boring tempo for a long enough time and we will have hypnosis. They might have fooled many with their earlier instrumental-driven discs, but with a heavy focus on more of a pop element, it has never been more certain that the group's songwriting abilities remain questionable at best while striving for an aesthetic that has always been beyond their grasp."
3,Too small,"I love this products smell and moisture. However, the amount is too small for the price you pay for it. Then, it falls out of the tube once the roll-on is near the bottow. What a pain to pick hair or dirt out of your lotion oil."
3,So So Tripod,"I am impressed by the functionality of the tripod. Very sturdy. Build quality a little to be desired. Scared will break after heavy use. I returned it due to a slippage in the panning from left to right. Only at a certain point, but still not good enough when you want an overall smooth pan. Maybe I will reorder another to see if it has the slight slip in the head on a pan. Fingers crossed."
2,Not what you would expect,"I already own the claw and ball style 7315 davis and stanford tripod, which is the little brother of this one. I was excited to get a stable tripod that would put the camera lens over 6' with grat stability. What Adorama, through Amazon, sent me was a used piece of junk. It was a returned item sent back out to me a full price. It had a bent pan arm, the bubble, for leveling, was defective, it was scratched, and teh head was jittery. None of the characteristics I recieved from my Newegg purchase for the other tripod. Adorama will sell anything. Good or bad."
1,Bad... just bad,"WARNING: This is an amateur film, shot on a digital camera. For a high school video project, it isn't bad. However, anyone expecting a professionally filmed & produced movie will be sadly disappointed. The cinematography is a joke. The acting is stilted and unnatural. The dialogue is dreadful. More time and skill went into producing the cover art than the actual product. Oh, and there's not even any gratuitous nudity to fast forward to."
3,Review,"All in all its a decent movie for a B-rate. The gore could be a little better, but the deaths are creative and truly a creative ""vengeance flick""."
3,Best Maverick horror film so far.,"In the past I have been totally disappointed with horror films put out by Maverick, the distributor of this film...mainly because of the sucky acting and lack of story, but Bad Reputation delivered in those areas. I liked the acting, direction, and look and feel of the film, however it felt like what Hollywood would have done if they made a rape/revenge movie. It played everything safe...too safe. You cannot do that with this type of movie. You have to go all the way. It felt like an ABC after school special in some parts. The dialog and acting again were top notch, but when it came time for the lead character to get her revenge it fell short. If you want to see a real indy rape/revenge film that doesn't hold back, check out The Hood Has Eyez. That's a masterpiece in degenerate exploitation cinema."
1,5 star shills,"Hmm, funny how 4 of the 6 ""five star"" reviews for this were written in August of 2007...and the DVD was released that very month. Either friends/family of the filmmakers, or they received free copies of the DVD and were asked (cajoled) into posting rave reviews (funny how people's opinions can be bought for something as cheap as a free DVD). Looking this up on Netflx you'll see the rating is a bit more believable--about 1 and three quarter stars (out of five). I've always found DVDs that have a picture on the cover of someone who's not in the film all to be a good indicator of what kind of ordeal you're in for..."
1,Lame attempt at rape/revenge,"All I gotta say is NO ONE GETS NUDE IN THIS FILM! How can you make a rape-revenge film and no body bares skin? Not one white chick bares bush in this mess. The murders are lame and not original and the acting is so-so. But again, there is no nudity. That was the deal breaker for me. There are much better recent rape/revenge films out there right now, likeThe Hood Has Eyez,Amateur Porn Star Killer 2 (Special 2-Disk Edition),Revenge Of La Llorona,Rape Is a Circle.Get those and save yourself the misery!"
5,An Excellent Illustrated Overview,"Although you can buy full editions of the more prominent works discussed in this volume and enjoy them in full (e. g. On the Art of Building, Towards a New Architecture), the real value of this work is in its illustrations. The bulk of the book consists of illustrations lifted from European architecture books from between 1500 and 1800, and these illustrations from now-obscure books are quite picturesque and excite the imagination. The selections of twentieth-century theory are also well done, providing us with similarly rich views of Classical Modernism, Metabolism, and other trends Aldo Rossi. While the text provides one with just a summary, the illustrations make this book an excellent value."
5,A Masterpiece,"The best movie ever made! Tim Curry, my favorite actor, is perfect as the great Long John Silver. The muppets are really great too, but in the end, Tim Curry is the gem of the movie. I like all the songs except for the one in the inn. My favorite was definitely the pirate song. I reccomend it anytime."
2,Film chopped to death.,"...As far as the quality of the Jim Henson production and story it could have been and was top notch. That is until Disney got a hold of the file and cropped the screen. It really does affect the musical numbers on the show. Disney should have simply released a two-sided disk, one for full and one for wide screen. I'm hoping that Disney will wise up and re-release this DVD wide screen. Hopefully either refund or give current owners a rebate towards the wide screen version. So Disney if you're reading this take note of all the other reviews that also dislike full frame.P.S. As for the story it's as good as all the other reviews say it is, if you can get past the missing chunks of the screen."
3,A disapointing DVD of a great movie.,"I really liked both ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"" and ""Muppet Treasure Island"". I think the Muppets to a fantastic job adapting literature to the screen in an enjoyable manner and I sincerely wish that they would return to this type of work (especially after the abysmal ""Muppets From Space"").HOWEVER -- unlike the first three Muppet movies, the DVDs for ""Muppet Treasure Island"" and ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"" contain the ""fullscreen"" version only. ""Fullscreen"" is a euphemism for the cropped image, instead of the ""widescreen"" image (also called ""letterbox""). In other words you've lost bits of the image to the left and right of the parts you can see ... and with the Muppets there are always little interesting bits going on _everywhere_ in the image.Kudos for the movies, but a BIG ""shame on you"" for not releasing the widescreen edition on DVD."
2,Disney releases edited version...,"""Muppet Treasure Island"" is a wonderful film. It is very funny and the acting is great. And while there are some nice special features on this DVD release, Disney has decided that they need to release the edited Full screen version because this film does not appeal to adults. Can you believe that? Disney thinks that adults don't like the Muppets. Well, I hope that Disney can release a Widescreen version in the future. If you want a pan-and-scan Foolscreen DVD, go ahead and buy it, but I suggest that people who want to see the film unedited should wait for when Disney decides to release it in Widescreen. Give the DVD a rent for the special features."
4,Well Worth It,"Some people have been complaining that about the fact that this DVD does not show the movie in its original widescreen format. It is unfortunate, but pan & scan is the only way I've ever seen this movie, and I still enjoy it thoroughly. The story is fun (though it doesn't worry about adhering to Stevenson's book too closely). The performances and songs are mostly entertaining. However, the main reason that this DVD is worthwhile is that it offers the most quality extras of any Muppet disc currently available (Muppet Christmas Carol, coming soon, should be comparable). Muppet Treasure Island features a making of featurette humorously hosted by Gonzo and Rizzo. The same two muppets also contribute to an audio commentary track with Brian Henson. But--there's more! During the commentary, the film is periodically halted to share even more behind the scenes footage. Don't let a few annoying moments or a simple aspect ratio keep you from enjoying this DVD."
5,I love the Muppets and the music!,"This movie was funny, and the music was great. The one thing I noticed was it seemed to be geared more toward older children and adults. I am not sure that young children would get the humor. However, I loved it, and I think other Muppet fans will too."
4,Awesome movie,This movie is a Muppet masterpiece! Songs that will get stuck in your head for days and little quirks you can only find with with Tim Curry.
5,Love this movie,I actually purchased this movie from Amazon a few years ago. Unfortunately it was misplaced so for Christmas this year I purchased another copy for my son. He loves it just as much as his big sister loved it when she was his age. I had this movie when I was younger on VHS so it was definitely something I wanted to share with my kids. It arrived before the shipping date so there was nothing to complain about. Love the Muppets!
5,Greatly Hilaaarious Movie for Whole Family,"Best movie I've ever bought! Hilarious, clever, and adventurous! Enough said!"
2,Muppet Treasure Island,"I'v received the DVD 'Muppet Treasure Island', but i'm in Australia the movie will not play on my DVD player, it keeps on displaying ""Error Region Code Incorrect"". I'm a bit disappointed."
5,Three cheers for muppets!,"I love watching the video again and again with friends, singing along with the songs and laughing at the same jokes and gags that never get tired!"
3,"Great Movie, Poor DVD","Muppet Treasure Island is a great Muppet Movie which tells the story of Treasure Island.The DVD however is very unfortunate. It is presented in FULL SCREEN Format only. I know some people don't understand what the big deal is, but WIDESCREEN is the theatrical format. FULL SCREEN is an edited version of the original theatrical (Widescreen format). Films were always edited to Full Screen for VHS. THere is always a message saying that it was modified from it's original version and has been formatted to fit your tv (Standard TVs). To edit the movie two inches are chopped off of both sides of the film in most cases.Plus on Widescreen Tvs to watch this DVD we have to wtach it as a box with two bars on both sides of the movie.There are also no Special Features,So again we'll say Great Movie, Poor DVD."
3,"Not their best, but gotta own it anyway","The movie still captures the muppet magic, but just not as sharply. Unlike a prior commentor, I loved muppets in space much more than this movie. The boy's singing is like nails on a blackboard...thankfully, he doesn't do it that often. I have all of the other muppet movies so far, and sadly this is their weakest...but alas, I gotta own it on dvd as I'm a muppet fan. It's worth seeing, but don't expect too much."
3,Still a decent Muppet Movie,"A lot of people panned this selection from the recent Muppet Movie installments, but I remain a fan and like the movie quite a bit. Gonzo and Rizzo once again man the narration helm and Tim Curry makes a great Long John Silver. The music is good, but is definately a touchy spot as some of the vocal ranges do not seem quite right. Just make sure you keep your mind out of the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" when watching Curry strut and sing."
5,Great movie,"This is a great movie...a lot of good songs, good humor and acting. It also looks very nice with all those shiny costumes, boats etc."
5,Muppets,"Fun DVD. I watch it while using the treadmill. My husband actually watched it also - really enjoyed it. I bought it for my grandchildren when they visit. Unfortunately my granddaughter has scarfed all the other Muppet movies and taken them home with her :-) This is another keeper... til she visits again ! :-) Better this than some of the other ""stuff"" that is out there."
3,Could Be Better,"As Muppet movies go this one is average, nothing spectacular. Tim Curry does a dastardly enough Long John Silver and our young protagonist isn't as annoying as most tend to be, but the jokes and gags just aren't as sharp as they were in previous Muppet productions. The music numbers aren't half bad though and there are some memorable moments. While it's nowhere near as bad as Muppets in Space, it's only a little better than Muppets Take Manhattan. If you want the good stuff see The Muppet Movie and the Great Muppet Caper or check out the Best of the Muppet Show DVDs. Here's hoping Disney anamorphically enhances it and hurries up with the excellent Muppet's Christmas Carol on DVD!"
1,Would have been a great film...if the product wasn't broken,"This movie is fantastic. Saw it when I was younger, it was funny. Saw it on TV the other day....still great. A classic really. Smart humor for both kids and adults.HOWEVER, the video tape I received did not work at all, had no picture whatsoever, and had awful sound.Complete waste of money. I guess you get what you pay for though."
4,This works for me,This was what I was looking for. I have MS and have limited movements but I could do this in my bed. It is broken down into morning and evening poses and the speaker is clear and has a soothing voice.
2,Just not much to it,"I practice yoga, but I'm definitely a beginner. I have regular back pain, and I have to modify many poses because I'm not flexible enough to do them. That said, this DVD just doesn't do anything for me. Most of the poses are things like ""hug your legs to your chest and rock side to side,"" things which are mild stretches, but anyone who's done yoga for more than a few sessions will stretch like this already, anyway. Even as a beginner, I feel this DVD is just too simple and low-impact."
3,Yoga in Bed DVD,"This DVD was less than I expected. The information is good, but they rush through it, not giving you time to do the poses as most Yoga DVD's do. Overall, I was disappointed."
3,"interesting concept, could have been a little better","I love the concept, but think it could be done better. The poses seemed rushed to me. Also, there is an underlying repetitive bass beat that can be kind of soothing, but it competes too much with the narrator's voice. When I turn the volume up high enough to hear the narrator's voice clearly so that I can close my eyes, the bass beat is very distracting to others in the house. So...I can only use this when I'm alone in the house, otherwise, I have to turn down the volume and keep my eyes open the entire time to watch the model, and then it is not as relaxing. :-("
5,How great is this!!!,"I travel plenty for business and feel a bit uncomfortable getting on hotel floors to workout, not to mention I am usually too darn beat to get into a workout. YOGA IN BED is the greatest solution and I get to stay in bed a bit longer...always an extra bonus! The morning routine really get the juices flowing and is a great start to the day, the evening wind down really quiets the mind and brings blissful sleep! Pick this little gem up...you won't be sorry."
4,John March is a guy you want to know...,"Black Maps is fine debut for Spiegelman. March is a very strong character, one that you look forward to growing with. The is not wholly original, but still a well done thriller. The ending has twists and turns that don't strain credibility (a huge advantage in this day and age of insane ""top this"" thrillers) and offer some geniune surprises. Spiegleman spends far too much time detailing the minute details of apartments and couches and features of minor characters, but that is typical of some first time authors. A good start to a promising series."
2,Too Descriptive,"I enjoyed the plot, but he seemed to get carried away with his descriptions of what people were wearing, how they wore their hair, shoes, posture. In other words so very descriptive that sometimes whole pages were dedicated to this, and they came quite often as there were quite a few characters. I didn't have to know what they were wearing (1/2 page) everytime they came into the story. I just skipped over them and finished the book faster."
3,Solid but leaves you wanting more,"Despite his family's wishes John March became a deputy sheriff for a small town until his wife was killed. Then he became a private investigator. In this book his lawyer asks him to investigate a blackmail case for one of his clients, a high profile banker. In doing so March finds himself in a mess bigger than he bargained for. This book is a great mystery that will keep you guessing to the end. I found it very enjoyable and would recommend it to anyone who likes PI crime books."
4,"Is it Mystery, Russian Sociology or Political Science?","Phillip Kerr is starting to look like the Robert DeNiroof writing. In his previous book, he immersed himself inevery possible detail of pre- and post-war Germany, with hismysteries unfolding within the thread of Nazism. Now, inDead Meat, he dissects post-Soviet Russia, with the optimism,fatalism and corruption that riddle the society. Kerr hascaptured the Russian psyche perfectly, while winding the plotaround the killing of a crusading journalist. How does a Britlearn so much about what hides within the heart of today'sRussia?I recommend this book for both the mystery and the sociologybehind it."
5,"Excellent; if you like Gorky Park, you'll like Red Meat.","Philip Kerr writes a great detective novel. In ""Red Meat"", Kerr weaves an interesting yarn of modern day Russia with all the intrigue of the new Russian Mafia. Kerr has obviously done his homework on current conditions in Russia, particularly St. Petersuburg (Lenningrad) and is very accurate in his description of the city and region. If you like detective stories set in Eastern-Europe/Russia along the lines of Martin Cruz-Smith's ""Gorky Park"" series, you'll love ""Red Meat"". I hope he writes many more novels of this genre set in the Commonwealth of Independent States"
1,Absolute failure,It is amazing to see Philip Kerr's talent dimishing so rapidly. Every new book brings more disappointment. Wish he could get the Russian names right at least!
4,"Interesting book, but not exactly what I had in mind.","This is an interesting book, and I recommend it; however, if you are looking for a book with an abundance of photographs of the work by these artists, while this one is better in that respect than are other books about his subject, there aren't many photos of actual cars and motorcyles that have been striped."
2,Better sources out there,"I wanted this to round out my collection of Kulture Books. This is more of an outsider view looking in, than something one who is truly interested in the Kulture would find truly interesting. There are a few nuggets, but true fans , look elsewhere. The Art of Big Daddy Roth is a better read."
4,Dress up magnetic daoll,This toy is great. My daughter loves it. The only thing I didn't like about it is that there is no cover on the box. It is a well made toy. Good quality.
4,So much fun!,Purchased this as a gift and watched my niece's eyes light up when she received it. She immediately started playing with them. She loved changing the outfits etc. My only wish is that the box it is packaged in had a cover that closed so it would hold all the pieces in it.
5,Maggie Leigh Magnetic Dress-Up,"My 3 year old granddaughter loves this. She has other Melissa & Doug magnetic dolls which she loves, too. She spends a lot of time playing with them. The quality is great and they are easy to take along to play with. Wish they had these when I was a child instead of the flimsy paper dolls I used to play with."
4,good value,"Good value for the money. I bought it for my 2 year old granddaughter and she is a little young for it (she loves it though!), she has to be supervised while playing with it or a small piece ends up in her mouth. I have put it away for awhile until she is a little older. Should be perfect for a three year old. It is annoying that there is no cover for it."
3,Easy to use.,"My grandaughter, 2 years old, is spending just a few minutes with this toy. Perhaps she is a little too young for the dress up idea."
5,Maggie Leigh,I purchased this for my granddaughter and she loved it the minute she opened the package. It is great for little fingers. It has several outfits and provides hours of fun. Top quality product. Better than paper dolls for the younger child.
4,4-year-old loved it,"My 4-year-old niece loves these dolls. They are magnetic, so great for travel and also makes it more difficult to lose the pieces. Super cute!"
3,magneti dress up toy,"I bought 3 various designs of this product. The grandchildren- 4,6 and 7 were not very interested. Very durable."
3,Fun Concept,"Loved the idea of this magnetic dress up as it was easy to add and change the clothes without the struggles of actually putting clothes on and off the real baby dolls. Bought this for two girls ages 3 and 5 at the time and they both loved it. Comes with a little box to keep the items, but inevetibably the parts get misplaced, which is not a big surprise. The girls' love to play with the toy and the magnets turn up eventually. Fun, simple and entertaining. Also good for in the car because the magnets stick and don't fly all over the place."
4,Reminds me of paper dolls...,This toy is great! I love the magnetic feature...very easy to change the clothing. Lots of outfit combinations to choose from.
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this wooden paper doll for my granddaughter for later, when she is old enough to play with it. I thought it would be more like the magnetic paper dolls I had so much fun with when I was little. The doll is cute and she has a lot of different outfits, shoes, etc., but they are also made of wood and are heavy and bulky and hard to align properly on the doll. It's cute, but I would not buy another one."
3,Its Ok,This toy is ok. It does not come with a lid to the wooden box that the pieces come in and some of the magnets are not very strong.
4,Daughter loves it but where is the plastic cover?,"We also have Nina ballerina and princess Elise, but Maggie doesn't have a plastic top to keep the pieces in which I am finding VERY frustrating since we store the other two on their sides, like a book, on a book shelf. I just don't get it! Other than that it is a really cute dress up toy and the skirts and shoes and gloves are interchangeable between the sets (some tops are, not all). My two boys like it too!"
5,Great insite on the Dolphins Cheerleading auditions!,"My daughter auditioned for the Dolphins Cheerleaders, and this video gave her a heads up on what was expected from the audtion process!!!"
2,ho hum,This product should be as much fun as being backstage at Miss America but it turns out to be as boring as being in the audience. It is recorded as if we are interested in the selection of cheerleaders as opposed to the cheerleaders themselves.
3,BPH A Growing Problem,"The first DVD that I received did not have the audio and the visual content synchronised, which distracted the viewer from the information. Without question this DVD was replaced by Amazon and a further one sent to me. It is probably because I am British that I (and my students)disliked the presentation! The information however is very good and the BPH condition explained very well. I have yet to find a similar one produced for the UK market (National Health Service)that might appeal more to this audience. Thank you, I am currently using this DVD weekly as a resource in my classroom."
3,GLOSSY BUT EMPTY,"JERRY RICE IS PROBABLY THE BEST WIDE RECEIVER OF ALL TIME. BUT THIS BOOK IS NOT. IT HAS SOME GREAT COLOR PHOTOS OF GAME ACTION AND OF JERRY AND HAS FAMILY. BUT THE REST OF IT LACKS ALOT. IF YOU LIKE VERY PLAIN AND UNDETAILED FACTS ABOUT JERRY THEN THIS IS FOR YOU. MOST OF THE BOOK IS PHOTOS, SOME STATS AND SOME VERY GENERIC FACTS ABOUT RICE AND HIS CAREER. TO ME IT IS NOT BAD BUT SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING."
1,Ultimate Rock & Roll Collection: 60's,"CAUTION:Purchased this cd, which has a great collection of songs from the 60's, but the disc skipped and did not work in most cd players. Several of the songs also could not be imported into iTunes."
1,do not like it,Hello.I want rock & roll songs from Jonny Rocket restaurant. This is not this type of rock and roll. Do you have any recomendation for me please? Thanks!
1,KNOCK_OFF,LOOK CLOSELY at the artists name after each song!!!!!!!!! Luckily I didn't buy this cd because I happened to notice it. I NEVER liked any artisit other than the original.
4,AN EXCELLENT COLLECTION OF ROCK OF THE 60S,I LOVE THIS ALBUM.IT CONTAINS 25 TRACKS OF GOODTIME 60S ROCK.YOU CANNOT GO WRONG. THERE ARE SO MANY MEMORIES PACKED IN THIS DISC.I OWN THIS CD. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.UPDATE YES THE SOUND OF THIS DISC IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE NEWER RELEASES..COLECTABLES HAS PRODUCED MANY GOOD SOUNDING RECORDINGS.AND YES THE QUALITY IS WAY DOWN ON MANY OF THE NEW CD RELEASES.THIS IS MOST LIKLY CAUSED BY COPYGUARD DISTORTION AND SLOPPY ENGINEERING.AND YES THIS IS THE SAME AS THE WCBS-FM RELEASE..I HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL FOR ALL CONCERNED.THANK YOU STEWART L.
4,"review on ""A Separate Peace""","I usually dont like reading books, and of course I had to read this one for school. I really got into it though! It really made me think, and it kept me on the edge of my seat, waiting for what happened next. This is a GREAT book!"
3,A Seperate Peace,"The novel, A Separate Peace, is a book with only a mediocre amount of suspense, and a star rating of three, was really a fairly good read. Many of my friends said that this book was the biggest waste of vocabulary and Latin and Greek classical roots. I, however, have a different opinion. After reading this book twice, I may conclude that it is a well written novel that anyone over the age of 10 could enjoy. It is about friendship and the stages and phases that young adults pass through. As if being a teenager wasn't enough, these boys had the pressure of having to fight in the war at an extremely young age! If you enjoy books that have a mix of tragedy, suspense, and a book about trust, this is the book for you.-"
2,Yet another sophomore forced to read this book...,"Don't get me wrong, I can see why people would really like this book, but I just thought it so mediocre, and I couldn't relate to the characters at all! Also, having to write a report on every chapter probably didn't help much either."
2,A waste of time,"Of all the books that were inflicted on me in high school English class, this was definitely the worse. Pretentious and stilted, ""A Separate Peace"" has the reputation of being a soul searing exploration of adolescent turmoil and the evil lurking behind the facade of everyday life, but in truth never offers any truthful insight into either of these weighty topics. The deepest conclusion it reaches is that people are capable of bad things. And it's a miracle if you can feel any sympathy whatsoever for the whiny, self-pitying narrator. It's hard to identify with anybody who is such an ass. A bore."
3,Ha Ha,I found this book boring at times but never exciting. I would not recomend it to any further english classes. This book started losing me when Finny fell out of the tree.
4,This Book Brightened Up My Summer?,"The novel A Separate Peace, written by John Knowles, deeply expresses the jealousy and betrayal as well as the joyfulness and loyalty found in close friendships among adolescents. Knowles highlights these feelings with a vivid setting that sparks flashbacks from readers all around the world, and engraves an even fuller picture in their minds. The underlying symbolism combined with the delicately crafted plot complete the novel, and provide the reader with a sure treat that will remain with them. I therefore, commend the novel with a **** rating for it's excellent portrayal of the relationship between two young boys who quickly find themselves becoming young men."
3,A good book with excellent symbolism.,"A Seperate Peace was a fairly good written book. The author did an excellent job of making the characters dynamic. I thought the use of symbolism was very interesting. I thought it was captivating how Finny turned out to be the good guy and how Gene turned out to be the bad guy. I also thought it was interesting how Gene would always follow whatever Finny did. For example, when Finny wanted to cut class and Gene didn't, he did it anyway because it was Finny who was egging him on. I also thought the ending of A Seperate Peace was very satisfying."
2,This book was to unrealistic for me!,"A Seperate made me think about what really happened. If you take the time to actually think you find out that Finny was never mad at Gene. I don't think there is one sane person on this world that would get pushed out of a tree and forgive the guy who did it. A Seperate Peace was just a little to unrealistic for my likings. This book is way overrated. If you are thinking about reading this book, make sure you really want to before you do it!"
4,It's just a review,"A Separate Peace is an enchanting tale of a young adult living in the 1940's in the midst of World War II. His name is Gene. The name of the high school Gene is attending is called Devon School for jabronies. It is located in New England. Gene boards at Devon School with another young man named Finny. Gene is a lonely, introversial intellectual, while Finny is a taunting, daredevil, athlete. Gene often found himself in envy of Finny's natural athletic abilities. Finny is not worried about ihis own academics at all. In the eyes of Gene, Finny is trying to sabotage his academic capabilites. Ironically, it is Gene who sabotages Finny's capabilities. Gene pushes Finny out of a tree and breaks his leg. Gene goes through many feelings of guilt and depression. Read more of this melancholy story of friendship and hardships."
3,knight,"The popular classic, A Separate Peace, is an exceptional novel that brings out the hardships and struggles of life. The setting takes place at a New England prep school, the Devon School, during World War II. A Separate Peace is a story about two friends' friendship during the war at the Devon School. Gene, the protagonist, struggles with feelings of jealousy and selfishness for his best friend, Phineas. As Gene fights his feeelings of jealousy and selfishness against his love for Phineas, his negative feelings overtake him. This leads to Gene's crippling Phineas for life. From my point of view, John Knowles(author of A Separate Peace) included the war in the book for it to symbolize the war that was being fought between Gene and Phineas at the Devon School."
4,A book that anyone can relate to.,"A Separate Peace is a great book which maintains the reader's interest. The book contains struggles and relationships that anyone can relate to. The protagonist, Gene, goes through many conflicts with himself about his friend ""Finny"", or Phineas. Gene envies Finny's athletic ability throughout the book. The book does a fine job of showing that friends can stick together no matter what happens with war and school. I highly recommend this book to anyone young or old."
5,Escapism,"I'm not surprised to read all of the negative reviews by children, since this is a classic that only now as an adult I can appreciate. This is a story about the innocence of children during a time of war, who are still lucky enough to be able to escape reality. Phineas is a unique character who perfectly exists in this pure environment until it is shattered by an act of violence."
2,it was bad,i didn't like the book i thought it was boring. i don't like reading books that are about the old days and the war. one of my teachers made me read it for school and i didn;t like reading it. i felt it was hard to understand.
2,Really Boring and Tiring,"For my honor's english class, we had to read this novel over the summer. I was in high hopes that this book was going to be excellent, but was very disappointed to learn that the book was incredibly boring, and did not hold my interest for very long. I do not recommend this book for reading pleasure, and wished that I could have read a book that relates to teenagers this day in age."
2,Hardly worth the effort of picking it up,"After hearing all of the wonderful things about this book, I must say I was very disappointed once I began reading Knowles ""classic"" work. The idea of the book is very good, but the approach taken by Knowles leaves much to be desired. Unless you have far too much time on your hands, avoid this book in favor of a book with more depth."
2,This is a classic?,"Uninspired dialogue, flat characterization and a cookie-cutter approach to symbolism aren't the makings of a classic. I'm amused at the righteous indignation some Knowles partisans can work themselves into. Are you bothered by the fact that people don't like this book, or rather that they have enough independence of mind to recognize a minor work when they see one?"
2,The English Class Bible (Straight from a 16-year old),"A Separate Peace has all the elements of a well written story. It's just so incredibly boring I couldnt watch the movie. The first ten pages were the worst part of the book. By page 15 I was out on my desk drooling. I had to make a run to Blockbuster. Sorry John, it just needs more action or something"
4,Eh ...,"I just finished this book for school. I was a big fan of Knowle's writing (metaphors, similes, character development) but the progression of the story was very slow. Also the plot isn't good enough to fill 170 pages. But I would recommend this book to people, especially those who want to write, merely for the character development."
2,I didn't expect it to be this bad....,"This book had a good message, and could have had a lasting impact on me. But the plot was obscenely dull, and the middle of the book (Gene and Finny relationship) does not seem to fit in with the rest of the book. Not recommended."
1,Worst Book I Was Supposed To Read,"I was supposed to read this book as a Soph in High School, I could not pick up this book and read it, and I tried! It was so boring that it was a struggle to get through one page! Turns out the lesson you learn from this book is that all people are capable of bad things? This is another example of one of those ""classics"" that you already know the moral to. Don't waste your time with this porly written and boring book."
1,Good but I didn't like it.,I of course recognize that this book is well written and a classic but I personally found it too depressing and uneventful.
3,Thnaks for the convenience,"This summer, my daughter's 9th grade class has to do summer reading on A Separate Peace. Needless to say, all local bookstores, and libraries could not keep up with the requests. So I turned to Amazon.com and thanks to you, we recieved her book within four days. For $2.50 and shipment of $3.00 it was worth every penny. It was in fair to good condition, as advertised and we were satisfied. At first she was a bit concerned that it had notes running alongside on some pages. Then she realized how those notes became very helpful to her as she read the book. In fact it was as if having a tutor, guiding her as she read. She felt great about this that in fact someone had already done most of the work for her. What a gift!! So sometimes a used, marked up, masterpiece, might be more valuable in the long run than a new copy.Thanks Amazon.Lorna Moodie-JonesMother"
1,Boo,"I've read this book twice in less than a year, but both times I was forced to and both times it was equally unenjoyed. I found everything about the story, especially Gene, extremely hard to relate to. Oh yes it's about envy and the loss of innocence and the loss of sanity and friendship and hidden feelings and yada yada yada, but at the end of the day none of this makes it a story worth telling. Not only is Gene unrelatable, he is also unlikeable. Finny may understand why Gene pushed him out of the tree, but I sure as sh*t don't. In fact, it angered me that Gene got to live on in what to me seemed like a zombie state and Finny, who had much more potential for a great life, did not. I thought Gene was stupid to assume that Finny needed him as much as much as he needed Finny. Gene tries to justify his actions by blaming it on the times or whatever else.. I say Gene is full of it."
1,Classically Bad,"Finny, the worst charecter ever. Well guy falls out of tree gets paralyzed end of story except when he gets murdered. LAME!!!!"
1,BORING ALERT!!!,"This book has to be the lousiest ive ever read. its boring, has a pointless plot and is a plain waste of time.Im not the only one, my entire english class agreed unanimously that it sucked.take my advice and AVOID it."
1,Classic Crap,"If you're thinking about reading this book, stop right now and go put some toothpicks in your eyeballs. This is about what it feels like to read this book. I love reading and have read titles such as ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Jane Eyre,"" and ""The Odyssey,"" but when I reached the end of this book I almost burned it. There's very little action and it's really not believeable. I think I would have had more sympathy for inanimate objects what with the way the characters were so symbolic rather than alive. I consider the time I spend reading it a wasted few weeks of my life and I now truly believe that high schools are out to torture children with these kinds of books, and if A Separate Peace teaches them anything it's that life is not too short to read a very bad book."
2,And why am I reading this...,"On the back of ""A Seperate Peace"" the summary includes the words,"" tortured world of adolescence"". This book is not close to being about the tortured world of adolescence, this book is about a book who did something stupid and then it haunts hiim for the rest of his life, and we are forced to hear him whine about it. I consider myself well read and open, and I am not enjoying this book. I am sorry for freshman english students who have to these 196 page of whining."
2,Perspective,"I've noticed that most of the low ratings for this book are written by people lacking cranial capacity to digest the book, not really due to any judgment of the content. Which is surprising, since this book is a quick and easy read. The book failed to make an emotional impact on me, because I saw the perspective as being ridiculous. If it was set in any other time period, this would not have bothered me. Here we have a ridiculous child obsessing over the social hierarchy of an all boy's school, worrying about silly things, while across the globe, war atrocities are occuring, people are dying. This setting puts the main character's, Gene, strife into the perspective that it is all silly childish nonsense. The only emotional resonance this book contains concerns Knowle's only likeable character, Phineas. That is what earns it two stars."
3,"A Separate Peace is a good book, but without much of a point","A Separate Peace is a good story of being a teenager, but I do not feel it has a point. If you are looking for a ""moral of the story"" in this book, you will be left disappointed. It is still an excellent book though."
1,BIG CHEEEEEESY REVIEW FROM THE CHEESEMAN!,A Separate Peace by John Knowles is a good book. It contains action and friendship fitted into one story. The story story revolves around he main character Gene and his time during the school year. This story shows the great friendship between Gene and Finny and how srong this friendship is even though they hurt each other accidently
3,"Interesting plot,boring book","I had to read this book for my grade 12 english class so I may be a little biased.(I hate being forced to read books)I found the plot involving mischievious Finny and Gene,the follower to be quite touching.I did not enjoy the hundreds of descriptions which seemed to overshadow the plot of this story.I believe that if the author had of cut down his wordiness it would have made for a better book.Nevertheless,I did enjoy the book.It has a surprising ending that leaves you feeling sad for the remaining characters."
1,A Seperate Peace,"A Seperate Peace is about two friends who are going to a college during World War 2. Gene is careful and intellegent. While Phineas (Finny) is wild and carefree. Although they are best friends, both are jealous of the other. Realizing that they are competitors, Gene pushes Finny out of tree. Personally, I didn't enjoy this book. I didn't seem to have a climax and didn't flow properly. The author also seemed to leave out a lot of major details. I don't recommend this book. I usually enjoy books on World War 2, but I hated this one."
1,Boring.,"Overall the book was not interesting but I did see some good in it, It really does bring you back in the past but it was just not interesting. The plot was good, laid-out very well, but I felt like things were going a little bit too slow for me, there wasn't much action to it besides maybe 3 scenes. This was my summer reading book for school though. And I read many books before and this is by far one of the worst I read. I just wanted to really stop reading it, almost tear the page off. But i had to for school. This is more for older people to read. Im 16 and couldn't find anything good to read in this book. I just didn't like it."
1,"If you're not being forced to read this, DON'T.","After reading this book and realizing it was required in many American schools, I had to wonder what was coming to the world. How can any decent school subject their students to this piece of trash? This was a horrible novel!Knowels use of first person through Gene should have made me feel closer to this character, but did not succeed. Instead it gave me a feeling of disconnectedness from other characters and made me truly feel like an outsider looking in, and wishing desperatly to turn away. This book was not only easy to put down, it was hard to pick back up again.Although difficult I succeeded in completing the novel. Throughout the entire story, the plot had seemed basic and annoyingly predictable. It seems as though Knowels threw Finny's death in at the end of the book not for closure, but as a vain attempt to convince the reader that they cannot see through the story. This was a waste of my time."
1,I really didn't like this book,"I read this book in my 11th grade English class. And I hated every moment. It was the first book that a teacher had given me to read that I hated.I didn't like the main character. I thought him an idiot. I didn't like the supporting characters. I didn't like the plot. I didn't like anything. Maybe it was the fact that there were no female characters and I had a hard time relating to young men in this situation.It's been a few years since high school and I've had people tell me to try to read it again. See if age has changed my views. I tried, got 30 pages into it and threw it down. I have such a strong reaction to this book, that I couldn't even give it a second chance.I realize this is supposed to be a big literary achievement but I hated this book. But at least I can't say I didn't react to it."
1,Pretty boring.....,"Ok, I had to read this for English class so maybe that's why I don't like it. The book is one of the most boring I have ever read. I would have less trouble going through a university chemistry text book than this poorly written junk. First of all, nothing interesting happens. Gene, as the narrator, is very annoying. Both Gene and Phineas are not very real seeming characters. I just sort of scanned through the novel after the first three chapters. This is not a good book for pleasure or study. D-"
4,This book perfectly represented the danger of insecurity.,This book was extremely realistic. The characters reacted to each situation with such true human reflex and emotion. The overall message I felt the novel portrayed was the danger and vainness of human jealousy and insecurity. It realistically described how destructive we can be when we allow our own insecurities to command us and take control. This book was enthralling and kept me reading. A definate classic!!
2,I really did not like this book,"I was required to read this book for class, and I really did not like it. The plot itself is interesting, but the author's style of writing is especially tedious."
2,Had the potential to be a really good book,"I was forced to read this book this year in school and it is awful. It starts out being a happy-go-lucky book about 16 year old boys then turns into a paranoid, hatefest! I hate the way that Gene who seems to be a perfectly healthy boy turns into a person with a bad case of paranoia in two chapters. This book is depressing for no reason and very pointless. Please don't read it because it is a waste of your time. Spend time reading some other books of a much higher quality."
3,Not what you think,"A Separate Peace should not be classified as a book that would teach you anything about war. While it does take place during the war, it shows no factual information about the book. The story is basically a struggle between inner conflict and also conflict in friendship. It deals with guilt, as Gene feels awful about the fact he broke Finny's leg. It has a lot of irony in that Finny dies in the end from bone marrow in his blood. Overall it is not a bad book, but in my opinion it taught me nothing about war. It taught me more about friendship and life at private school."
2,ASP school reading,"I had just read the book A Separate Peace by John Knowles. This book had no action of any kind what so ever. If you are a patient reade, then you will enjoy the book. However, if you need continuous, ongoing, exciting situations, then you will not like the book. The book is extremely dull and boring. You need to really go in the middle of the book to find some exciting situations. The love, violence, and excitement are not found easily and are not found in a bold manner. Even though I am a kid that doesn't enjoy to read, I feel that anyone in their teen years will not feel this a strong book. However, there are always some people that enjoy all different types of books."
4,"Sad, but good","A pretty depressing novel but a good one and friendship is displayed nicely by Knowles. If you like stories with good friendships and compelling drama, I suggest you read A Separate Peace. It's nicely moving and a timeless classic!"
1,ASP school reading book,"I have just recently read the book A Separate Peace by John Kowles. This book didn't interest me at all. There was nothing that made me want to read this book. I'm not saying that everyone won't like this book but unless you love to read just to read you will hate this book. This review isn't from a student that hates to read, I actualy like to read. The thing about this book that realy made me dislike this novel was that there was no real action, it was dull and bland. I do not recomend this book and encourage people not to read this book unless forced to read this book."
1,I hated it!!!,"Perhaps it's because it was forced upon me at school..perhaps it's because I can't relate to a book about boarding school boys during WW2 because I am a teen girl in the 90's. However, I liked Catcher in the Rye well enough... I know it's got a moral, and is probably interesting to some...but imho it was boring and pointless. I could not connect or feel any emotion for Finny and the other guy. The only thing I liked was Leper Lepellier, and I can't remember why. I completely agree with Lisa Simpson."
1,Couldn't finish this non-gripping tale,"I think this novel demonstrates why we ""don't all get along."" Anyone who can give this novel a 10 is someone who I would probably find to be most unpleasant company. This is the story of two in-duh-viduals with character traits that I find thoroughly repulsive. Guess I just can't relate to sensless jealousy and lack of achievement. Somone explain to me why I should finish this book."
1,ripped off!,I ordered the leather bound copy of A Separate Peace and paid $14 for the book. Instead I got a worn out cheap paperback book of the title.
1,"Overall, it's ridiculous","This book is full of the flowery, unnecessary sort of detail that I'm used to seeing in these so-called classics. I found myself just turning the pages it was so boring. And I have to say that the plot was upsurd; what kind of sixteen year-old knocks their best friend out of a tree because he's jealous??? If Gene was a real person, he would be a total psycho. Lastly, no teenager would ever talk or think the way these characters do. This book makes me wonder what the heck kind of world John Knowles lives in."
1,One to many stars.,"This book is the only book I have ever read that is actually dumber than a TV sit-com. I've read short stories that had a more intricate plot. Characters in Saturday morning cartoons have more depth. Intense, only for people get scared watching Disney movies. Symbolism are sure there is any? If you want symbolism read The Old Man and the Sea or The Pearl. While I was reading this I saw a Simpsons episode where Lisa Simpson says this book is at preschool reading level. A preschooler though might find it a bit below their intellectual level."
1,Not well-developed,"I had high expectations for this book when it first started out. Take the beginning and the end and you have a pretty good story, but it seems to drag on into a meaningless void in the middle. Some people seem to love this book but it did not appeal to me. The characters did not seem very well developed, having one personality trait that was shown the entire length of the book. While Leper was supposed to be crazy, it seemed to me that all the characters were crazy, maybe more so than Leper was. The book was not realistic to me, appearing more like a painting that expresses only the outside than a book."
1,A story about the conflicts and illusions about friendship,"The novel A Seperate Peace, an involved book, tells a story about the conflicts and illusions about friendship. Personally I hated the characters and the plot and by association I have come to hate john Knowles as well. If I set out to write a book I would at least try to make it interesting. Please send me e-mail if you agree with me or disagree. I want to know everyone else's opinion and if I maybe read a different book."
1,I love the Simpsons for bashing this.,"On a Simpsons episode Lisa said ""I hate John knowles"" ,if we're talking about his writing since I don't know him personally, I couldn't agree more. Well maybe he wrote something else that was good, but I don't intend to find out. If mentioning the Simpsons makes me sound like a moron I'd like to say I've enjoyed some Steinbeck, Rousseau, deMaupassant, Pirandello, & Tolstoy. All the ""likeable"" characters died or went insane. This is the worst excuse of a pseudo-intellectual mess I've ever read. I had to read it in High School, but there are better books out there for High Schoolers. So many in fact it's sad people assign this disturbing trash. However... I remember, it's been years, that some of my former classmates liked it so maybe it taps into something I'm not getting. Here's hoping I never do."
2,A Separate Peace of Trash,"I really was expecting the type of novel that would persuade me to tell others about. Not only did the story run sour, but the plot seemed to start at the climax and work downhill from there. Also, the novel should be taught, but only to classes who like Knowles' work."
2,Extremely Boring,"This book started off slowly and I patiently waited for it to get better. But the more I read, the more bored I got and I realized that I didn't care about anything that was happening in the novel. The writing was dull as well as the characters. Gene causing Finny to break his leg and all the stuff that happened after was less than thrilling."
4,This is a good book,"I had to read this book for my 11th grade English class. When I was assigned the book I was not too excited. But then when I finally started to read the book I got really into it. This book is one of the best books that I have read in a while. I thought that this book was very easy and fun to read. The way that the story moves from scene to scene in the beginning is a good way to start out a good story. The main characters, Gene and Finny, are roommates with each other. Finny organizes a club during their summer session. And the rest of the book revolves around what happened that summer. If you want to read a good book, I suggest that you read this book ""A separate peace"", by John Knowles."
3,I Don't Understand,I thought that the book was kind of interesting. It lost me though at some points. At the end of the book I didn't understand what it was all about. I have sat and thought on it and it still doesn't click. I thought that it had pretty good content and was written well. It kind of had an impact on me because I have a verry close friend but we get along good and I would never do something like that to her. That is the part of the book that I didn't really under stand. How did he come to the conclusion that finny wanted to make him fail. I have no clue but over all the book was hind of good and held my attention for a little while but not for long.
3,"Over-all a good book, but gets depressing at times.","I liked the book very much, and found great symbolism, by Knowles. If you want to read about a struggle of WW2 then this is a must read."
3,"To many extra, unneeded parts!!","After I read it, I liked it. I never would have picked it up if I wasn't forced to by a class assignment. It was all around a pretty good book!"
5,A Beautiful Book,"I read this book for school this year, and it was probably the most profoundly moving experience I've ever gotten from a book. Gene and Phineas were greatly developed characters, Gene a symbol of the dark side of human nature, Phineas of youthful innocence. The friendship between them is truly touching, and the climax rightfully poignant. It ends on a quiet sad note. A great book, recommended to anyone."
5,Intense! Tell me more! The frightening this is that I relate,"This book captures you and draws you into the plot while it thickens. As you find the secrets behind each closet door, your faced with the desire to tell someone, anyone, what will happen next. Any bad reviews on this book generally come from high school students who are upset with the general reading assignment. After they grow up, I can ensure that they will look back, and pick up this book to read over again. I know I did!!! And I haven't regreted it in the least."
1,"This book is very depressing, boring, and not worth it.","I hated this book. I was required to read it twice: in 8th grade and Freshman year and I hated it more with every page. High school boys don't think like that, they're not murderous crazy people they're boys. Knowles does not know what he is talking about. The writing is poor and the overall plot is boring and depressing."
1,There is no point in reading this.,"I had to read this book at school and it took me SO long to finish it because it was so boring. It's about a bunch of high school kids who are not realistic at all. The plot is pretty much whether or not the main character tried to kill his best friend by pushing him off a tree branch. I never really found out if he did try to kill him, which makes this a very pointless book to read... The people who love this book love it because of hidden meaning and other stuff English teachers always talk about. If you're like that you might like this book. For the rest of you, don't read this book. It's a waste of time."
1,I CAN'T STAND A SEPARATE PEACE,"I read ""A Separate Peace"" for school this past year. First off, the book didn't catch me from the start, which isn't a good sign when you're reading a book. The book is so unrealistic, but it seems like the author is trying really hard to be. For example, one of the main characters, Finny fell down and broke his leg, then broke the same leg again and died from it. All of the characters were dysfunctional, and weren't well defined at all. There was no concrete plot, and my entire class didn't like the book, or the movie."
2,A boring book,"""A Separate Peace"" was a book that I had to read for my summer reading list from school. The whole book was very descriptive and I guess original but the plot itself was extremely boring. I had to force myself to finish it."
1,Yawn.. how did I ever finish this book?,"A Seprate Peace is extremely dull book. It has a nice plot, but it is ruined by the extreme details (we're talking about pages describing one thing) and a lot of metaphors. (And plus, my teacher ruined it even more by finding more obscure metaphors, such as Phineas is Gene and vice versa.) If they had been used more lightly, then the book would have been more of a pleasure to read. If you love details and metaphors, this book is for you. If not, stay away."
1,Pointless and Boring,"I understand it's supposedly a ""classic"" but I do not consider it to be one. A novel worthy enough to be studied in school and tested on, should be deeper than A Seperate Peace. Yeah, so it has a lot of symbolism. BIG DEAL. This book was horrible. I couldn't relate to the main character, because he was just nasty and unlikable. It has been commpared to the Catcher in the Rye, but it's nowhere near as poignant as that novel. (my fav btw). I love to read but this book was stupid and I got NOTHING out of it."
1,Disappointing,"Reader reviews range from 5 stars (MASTERPIECE) to 1 star ( TRASH). I come down at the 1 star level, but would not label it trash.Rather, I question the validity of the story line from beginning to end. If Knowles intended symbolism the obvious interpretation of the Cain and Abel story is so heavy handed as to be laughable.I lived through that period in time, at the age of the leading characters, who would now be in their seventies. Their attitude toward WW 2 is totally off base, and doesn't reflect the feelings of my contemporaries or me at that time.The falling from the tree premise is articial and strains credulity. As does many of the other devices used by the author.How this book achieved the status of a classic is a puzzle."
2,Disappointed,"I knew the book was used, but did not expect it to have writing on almost every page in the margins and a lot of highlighting and underlining....I thought it would be slightly used...disappointed in product"
1,BoRiNg,i dont think that this was a good book at all. i thought it was boring and i didnt understand it that well! of what i read anywayz! i thought that gene and phineas were crazy and i jus didnt like how things were put!
5,One of the best books I have ever read,"A Separate Peace has to be one of my favorite novels by far. It is exceptionally written in an easily readable, yet poetic style. It is a novel that will stay with you long after you turn the last page.In the novel Gene Forrester, a student at a boy's prepatory academy in New England, explores the enmity that he believes is present in everyone, except for his best friend Phineas.The novel opens upon Gene's return to Devon, and is told through his reflections over the events that happened while he was at school there during World War II. As he reflects over events that have troubled him over the years, he begins to come to an understanding, and eventually, a peace."
3,A Review of A Separate Peace By LMAO!,"After Reading A Separate Peace by John Knowles, I felt that the book was a very good read. However, I thought that Gene and Finny had the weridest realtionship ever. It seemed that Gene liked Finny, but deep down inside his soul he wanted to hurt him real bad. Leper was one of the oddest individuals in the story, to his letter to Gene, to him hallucinating. The book did give comic relief when they had the snowball fight, and wrestled in the snow with the barrels of cider. Overall the book was pretty interesting, it was average, but it was interesting. Read the book, if you want."
2,um... OK then,"OK, I know this book was supposed to be about a boy and his inner struggle with himself about his friend Finny but I found it so boring. Reading this book was like watching a soap opera. There were separate stories going on in one story. Everything was jumbled together into one really boring book. I've read many books and only one other that I've read bored me as much as this one did, that book being The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemmingway. That book has about as much plot and action as A Separate Peace. A man goes back to his favorite school, man has a flash back about a particularly bad summer, man leaves school. But all in all I guess the book does get a rating of ""2"" due to all the imagery and the way the book was written. And I guess, because the book does deserve some credit, that it was an OK book to read if you have an extra 2 hours on your hands."
5,One of the best books ever written,"As a sophomore in high school, my older sister was assigned this book for her English class. In an effort to emulate her (a continued goal throughout my adolescence) I stole her copy, and proceeded to be exposed to one of the greatest novels I have ever had the opportunity to read. Since then, I have reread A Separate Peace time and time again, each time becoming more enraptured with this classic tale. A must-read for anyone."
2,A classic? That is debateable,"The book is written very well, and the author is not as terrible as he may be given credit to. But the book only lacks in one area... Entertainment value. I was required to read this book for an English class, but did find it to be interesting, just not entertaining at all."
2,This book wasn't a real winner in my opinion,"I didn't really like the book. I had to read it for my sophomore advanced english class also, and maybe it was the way we analyzed EVERYTHING, but I dreaded having to read it. I think that the 2 rivers should have just been 2 rivers... meaning I don't think there should have been symbolism in every little detail and you shouldn't have had to read everything 3 or 4 times to get the entire meaning that Knowles was going for. I just didn't like it. Sorry if you disagree."
2,hmmmmm...,"I read the book for my sophomore advanced English class, and it seemed to drag on and on with boring unnecessary details. I found the implied homosexual attitudes of Gene and Finny amusing, but I found that the only segments of the book that really interested me were the ones involving physical or emotional pain. (If you didn't notice the subtle hints of Gene & Finny's homosexuality, go back through the book and look for them -they're pretty evident."
2,"Bland, boring, bad","I found John Knowles ""classic"", ""A Seperate Peace', incredibly dull and uneffective. The story of two very different young men growing up in a war-shooken world sounded interesting, but it just dragged on and on with uncreative dialogue and descriptions. The ending of this book was mildy poignant, that is the only positive thing about it. Some have compared ""A Seperate Peace "" to J.D. Salinger`s ""Catcher In The Rye"", but this book lacks all the good things ""Catcher In The Rye"" is famous for."
4,I'm Glad I Picked This One Up,"When I got to college, I found that I was pretty-much the only person at the university who hadn't read this high school. For some reason, my teacher didn't use it. But this book kept coming up in discussions. It seemed to me that a lot of the people around me had been able to relate to Knowles's novel and it seemed that a lot had benefited from reading it. Anyway, I had to read it to see if I could see and feel what they fealt. I did.A Separate Peace is about a lot of things. It's about the deep, though fragile, friendship between Gene and Finny. It's about how we manage do create identity and how we should. It's about the battles we create, the jealousies we foster, and the people we destroy. Lastly, it's about the sacrifices we can choose to make.A Separate Peace is a wonderfully written book. I can see why it has been loved (an hated-the truth hurts) by so many. It's certainly a masterpiece that I'm so glad I went back and discovered."
3,It's not a romance!,"Well, when I read the back, I was mistaken and thought it was more about two people falling in love over the summer...NOT to boys at a boarding school where it turns out there's more competition involved and it's really only on the one end. I could relate many of the characters to people at my school and foundit very interesting how things were looked at. It's a very good book taking place during WWII. It's a combination of imagination, lessons of life, and learning to live in the hards times. Definitely a GREAT book, but I wouldn't suggest it for those under the age of 10...and I'm actually 16, but didn't want to become a member."
5,"If you like Huck Finn, you'll love the character of Phinny","This is a very well-written novel. I found myself feeling all the joy and fun and guilt that the main character, Gene, felt.This was one novel I couldn't put down. I'd like to read more by J. Knowles."
4,A Seperate Peace brings together friendship and jealousy.,"A Separate Peace brings together a clash between friends and jealousy. The friends, Gene and Finny, seem to have a good relationship until jealousy begins to well up in Gene. At this point the book begins to take a crazy spiral into Gene's mind, thoughts, and his guilt. The book exhibits values of friendship and deception all at the same time. The book also displays how powerful the mind can be. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading books with many twists and turns. This book also contains plenty of suspense and a surprise ending."
4,A Separate Peace is a tale of growing up,"Two boys struggle with maturity and growing up in John Knowles A Separate Peace. Phineas will do anything for his best friend Gene. Gene feels threatened by Phineas affability though. These feeling lead to Gene causing Phineas to fall from a tree and shattr the bone in his leg. This break leads to Phineas ultimate death. I found this book very enlightening of the teenage mind and mentality. John Knowles insight on the teenage mind would have led me to believe he still was one, if it had not been for his developed but efficient writing style. The story and the writing made this book very enjoyable reading."
4,Touching,"This book is a great book. I didn't know about this book until our teacher required us to read it in our G/T 7th grade class. I'm glad she did, though. A Separate Peace is filled with symbolism, which was one of the things I liked about the book. It shows the true meaning of friendship and changed my life forever. The only downfall was that some of the parts were a little boring."
2,Paid for expedited shipping,"I needed the book quickly, paid for expedited shipping ($7.00) and it was mailed snail mail. For something as small as this book was, the $7.00 should have more than paid for it to get to me within 2-3 days. It took 7 days and by then it was too late. It is still sitting on my desk wrapped in the envelope it was sent. Very disappointed."
3,A Seperate Piece,"This book had little markings on it, but I was expecting that. Otherwise, the book was in great shape. No pages ripped, no missing pages, etc. Although the book is boring but interesting to me..."
1,This book is a vial tool of sadistic English teachers...,...who are too inept at their jobs to teach AP classes and are thus stuck with Freshmen English and who cannot understand even the Cliff's Notes versions of real masterpieces and must therefore stick with trite coming of age stories that turn off generations of adolescents from reading.This book is a prime example of why Americans no longer read.
1,"i could give it a big fat ""0""","Terrible book, Terrible Plot, No substance, nearly retarted. Enough said..."
2,The separate peace suxs,"I did not like the book, the Separate Peace.The book did not really catch my attention. The way the book was written and how the story unfolded.I did not like how the author kinda portred that some of the charactars were homosexual. In alot of stories I have read I have liked the charactars. But in this particular story the charactars di not apel to me at all. So any one that I lokking to read this book I do not recomend It."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I force my 10th grade class to read ""A Separate Peace,"" and force is the perfect description of what I do; they don't like it. And (to be honest) I don't really like it either.It is the story of Finny and Gene--two sixteen-year-old boys in a private school in New England. Gene knocks Finny from a tree early in the novel, leaving the reader several questions: Why did Gene do it? Does Finny know Gene did it? What does the tree symbolize? What is the relationship between the school and WWII? Why is this young-adult classic putting me to sleep?This isn't a bad novel for a kid, but I would suggest that anyone with above a 5th-grade reading level stay away from it--unless you are having trouble sleeping."
1,Should Not Be a Required Book,"The setup of the school and of Phineas' home was remarkable. The plot was just as bad as a Gary Paulson novel; terrible. No flavor or emotions within the narration. Characters were dull and completely black and white. This book should have been excellent, but it wasn't. Beware this book. Do not buy this book. There are many other authors and books that deserve your reading leasure."
1,No Book Received,I ordered this book WEEKS ago and still have not received it!!! Please do not order a book from this company
3,A seperate peice,"This book was ok. It was written well, but it was very slow and made me lose interest at times. It is about 2 young boys and a terrible event that happens between them while growing up in a boarding school during the second world war. it portrays the two former best friends trying to make ammends and live during this terrible war time with this terrible event that happened between them."
3,It needed pictures,"It makes u think, if u can't think then it's not the book for u. Challenge yourself and read it. if u're smart, u'll like it. if u're normal like me, u would probably think that it needs some pictures."
4,Well written but lost on today's youth,"I read this book in high school, but wanted to reread as an adult since I didn't remember the story. It is still assigned, but most kids these days will fail to grasp the point Knowles makes about jealousy and the struggle of the inner self. I think it is still a valid selection for English, but not as powerful as other works required. I enjoyed the book, but the value will unfortunately be lost for the most part by today's youth."
1,A definate yawner,"This book is extremely boring. I am not A.D.D but all I read through the whole book was blah blah blah .... phineas... blah blah blah. Maybe this book related to teens back when it was written, but not anymore. I do not know any seventeen year old boys who are sooo infatuated with their best friend that its like they are in love with them. Sometimes I start to feel sick while reading this book! It is sooo boring it makes me want to weep. Anyway, if you ever have to read it for school, Happy reading... err... sleeping."
1,HELL NO,I was assigned to read this book for summer reading. It was a horrible novel about a sick teenager who is both attracted to his friend and hates him to the point where his friends death was a virtual murder. I WOULD NEVER READ THIS BOOK AGAIN IF U PAID ME!
1,A Classic Work Of Tedium,"This is, quite honestly, the most boring book I have ever read. The author's writing ability is nowhere near even reasonable and the plot is practically nonexistant. I had to read this book 4 years ago when I was in high school and have loathed this work ever since. I highly reccomend that no one should ever buy this book and if anyone has it, they should throw it away."
3,lessons we can learn,"a sperate peace is an amazingly written book. i advise it for anyone who wantsn to read about the importance of friendship, and how to live life as if each day was your last, because sometrimes, it may be."
4,Story for friends and envy,"The author, John knowles, uses a different way to show friendship and envy.The story start with the main character returns to his high school. The memories of his high school years quickly are given to you."
3,uh please,"I had to read this for english and let me tell you, i didn't like it. The kid Gene becomes so paranoid, and I didn't understand half the things that went through his head. The charcters were strange, especially Gene. ZFinny was your typical great at sports guy, but he got on my nerves too. It's an okay book, but i don't recomend reading it unless you have to."
5,I loved it.,"I really enjoyed this book from cover to cover. It was an assigned read for my English class, so I had some guidance through the symbolism, which was very helpful. Most of this symbolism and foreshadowing was acheived through the details, so to any future readers, be sure not to skim it over. The relationship between Gene and Phineas was one that i could relate very well to my own life and my own experiences even though i was not alive during WWII. Although I think guys would get even more from it than girls would, I still learned many lessons from this book and would recommend it to anyone."
4,twisted but a good read,"I thought this book was very good, one of the best I've read so far. The friendship between Gene and Finny is twisted yet believable. Everyone at one point or another is jealous of their friend(s) because of one of their characteristics or traits, but Gene's jealousy was taken too far. Finny's character is unbelievable because he is so perfect, but the other characters balanced him out perfectly. I thought Leper's craziness at the end of the novel really characterized the hell of war."
3,WHAT!?!,"I had to read this book for my sophomore honors english class, and although I enjoyed reading this book and really got into the lives of the charecters and what it was like for them in living in a bording school during WWII, but i still dont get how phineus...........well im not going to ruin the book for all of you who havent read it yet, but you'll see what i mean. This book is defenitly worth reading."
4,A Seperate Peace,"This book by John Knowles, is a very well thought out book. I read this book for an english honors class. We have to analyse this book. The book tells the story from Gene's point of view, and tells his emotional battle with his fall from grace. You should read this book and also write a review on this touchin book. Read through the entire book and then read the first chapter again. This is a type of book that the first chapter does not make sense til you finish the entire book"
2,A high school horror,"The author's prose style is belabored, the dialogue is stilted, and the characters are one-dimensional. The symbolism is not woven into the story gracefully; instead, the author hits you over the head with it like a hammer. There are plenty of better choices for high school reading lists. Evidently, educators believe that if any enjoyment can be gleaned from the reading experience, it cannot be good for you."
2,The English Class Nightmare,"I saw all of the glorious reviews the others gave this book, soI felt it was my duty to inform you, the reader, of the opinion ofeveryone I know who has read this book. Not only is it written completely pedantically, but there is minimal character development and one-dimensional emotion. Like the rest of the high school students out there, I was forced to read the book, and got little out of it. The plot borders on ridiculous and the fact that it is considered a classic truly astounds me."
3,A Wonderful and Exciting Book,"I think that this book was very good, because it gave you a look at two different people. These two were brought together because of their friendship and one accident that changed both of their lives. I thought that the ending would turn out a little different because of the direction the book was going in. But overall I thought it was a good book."
3,This book was interesting and it caught my intellectual side,"I found that A Separate Peace was a very interesting novel. It explored the feelings of high school students during World War II. It also displayed the common inner hatred or envy between friends. John Knowles, the author, put a lot of himself into this novel. First, he placed the setting as a School in the country with a rather large campus and nature-like surroundings, just like the school that he went to, Phillips Exeter Academy. That school is just like Devon. Also, he grew up during the war, just like the protagonist, Gene. I was extremely impressed with the way that Knowles wrote this novel, and encourage all readers to read this novel."
3,I enjoyed this book.,"A Separate Peace had an interesting point of view. It tells the story of the friendship of two young men, Gene and Finny, in their high school years during World War II. I enjoyed the book because I found it amusing to hear the thoughts of Gene and his point of view toward Finny while Finny actually played the part of a true and caring friend. I also found it disappointing and depressing that Gene had the feelings that he had towards Finny. Gene had a selfish and competitive character, only looking out for himself. The book had more of a sad side than a happy side, but it taught some valuable lessons."
3,reviewing A Seperate Peace,A Separate Peace is about two young men and the experiences that they go through together during the year 1942. Gene Forrester is the narrator. He recalls what had happened 15 years ago. Phineas is his friend and he is very athletic. This novel strongly suggests the theme of war and all the personal wars that people go through. A Separate Peace is a really good novel and I think that everyone should read it. I hope you do to when you read it.
3,A Separate Peace by John Knowles,"A Separate Peaceby John Knowles is an interesting read. I am not sure why it's considered a classic, but it is. It has some very real characters in some very real dramas. Some situations you can see in everyone's life but, some conversations seem odd and out of context. It addresses the darkness that hides in the human heart and the daily struggle to conquer it. Most wars are fought and won...or lost in our minds before we ever step over the threshold of our house. We must control the crazy urges that run through us if we are to travel through life without maiming others, whether its our words or actions. That is the central theme.A boy's journey to recognize the darker parts of his mind and conquer them. It's worth reading , just to say 'I've Read It.'A Separate Peace"
5,Still one of my favorites,"Just came back to this book after being away from it for about 20 years. A lot can happen in that time. We get older, a little more jaded, tastes change. I don't like Catcher in the Rye as much as I did as a teenager, but this book still resonates with me. It's poignant and sad and uplifting at the same time. I have fond old memories of this book and after re-reading it again just recently I have new memories that stay with me forever."
4,Pimped out Review,"A classic I would recommend to another person is A Separate Peace by John Knowles. The story is about two friends who go to the same boarding school. It tells about their problems between each other, their family, and with themselves. I think this book is good because it deals with problems that could really happen to you. For example, one person didn't believe in him. He finally decided to go because he believed in himself and realized that he had to believe in himself. I also think it was interesting to find out what would happen to the characters, as they went their separate ways. If you like books that have a lot to do with real problems that could happen to you, I recommend you read A Separate Peace by John Knowles."
5,Outstanding Literature,"Too many grownups bypass this masterpiece--and that's what it is--because they consider it an adolescent's book. Don't ignore A Separate Peace simply because it's become required reading in high schools and middle schools and because book superstores display it in the juvenile literature section. If you love excellent writing; if you appreciate it so much that when you read a particularly well-written passage you read it again, to savor it; if you enjoy descriptive prose that puts you right there in the place and the moment, you must read A Separate Peace."
3,The big question remains unanswered,"At first, I did not think much of this book. However, as it went on, I saw the depth of the plot, and the uncertanties within it. There seems to be so much jealously towards the other that you have to wonder if they are actually friends. When someone dies toward the end of the book, there is one big question that is not answered. I don't want to spoil it for you, so go ahead and read it!"
3,A New Perspective on World War II,"A separate peace is a novel about two boys coming of age during world war two. The story is set at boarding school in New England. Phineas or Finny to his friends was the extrovert, the most popular guy, the one person that everyone wishes they could be. And then there was Gene- quiet, reserved, intelligent; he is Finny's conscience- his inner voice. During a period of time in which the entire world was consumed by the turmoil of the war, Finny and Gene had their own peace a separate peace. A peace away from the harsh realities that were. Finny was always able to create a sense of safety and a calm that filled the air.The book really is like no other- rather than focusing on the hard times of the war the book focuses more on the fun times when there was still actually lives outside of the war. The book helps the reader feel safe and entranced into the past.I give the book two thumbs up!"
2,It&#65533;s been done before,"The story of a struggle between friends is almost a cliché. It seems that authors use this topic if they just need to put another book out on the shelf. The main character, Gene, wallows in his own self-pity so much that it made me wish that I could punch him in the face. The only good part of the book was the character Phineas. He was full of imagination and tried to make the best of the war, World War II. He even made Gene forget about the war and train for the 44' Olympics. There are books out there that have much better story lines and have a better impact on the reader than this one."
1,One of the Most deadly dull books I've ever read.,"I was forced into reading this book in Language Arts, and I can honestly say it's the worst book I've ever read for school, I almost didnt read it at all.. I was prepared to get my Zero with pride, but I thought maybe it would get a little better, I was wrong. The characters were fake, the plot was awful. Worst of all, the forgiving scene was impossible. when you hear that you know whats going to happen from then on, you dont need to read it any longer.Unfortunately I, like Gene *mutters* WANT that A. I need that A, so I read it through and now I am reviewing it with as much honesty as I can. the only character I almost liked was Leper, and that was because I felt sorry for him.If you have to read it, my condolenses, if you want to read a slow dull book, go right ahead and pick it up as soon as possible."
2,boring book,this book is really boring but if you like analyzing stuff and enjoy reading about competition between boys i would recommend it
1,Word vomit,"I was forced to read this book when I was in grade school. That was over 12 years ago, I have traveled to many foreign lands and read many books and this one sticks with me as one of the worst ever. It was so BORING! I even read the sequel for extra credit on my own free will and it was just as BORING! The author has no verbal skills and an advertisement for cat litter is more exciting to read than this heap of garbage."
1,THIS WAS THE WORST BOOK EVER!!,"I WAS FORCED TO READ THIS BOOK IN MY LIT CLASS, AND I CAN SAY ITS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. THE PLOT WAS BORING. THE CHACTERS SUCKED. IF I COULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS I WOULD IN A SECOND! SO THIS IS JUST A WARNING TO ANYONE WHO THINKS IT MIGHT BE GOOD, DON'T READ IT!! THE MOVIE SUCKED TOO!"
1,I'm being generous by giving it one star.,"This book has no plot. Okay, then does _A Separate Peace_ make up with deep characterizations and beautiful style. No. The style is techinically perfect, but lacks any verve. The characters are lame. The 16 year olds act like annoying 13 year olds. Gene is immature and I wouldn't bet money on his heterosexuality. Phineas is an idealized best friend as oppose to a character who is realistic. Everyone else is a stereotype (the smart, nerdy kid, the jock who is a jerk etc)...."
2,"""A Separate Peace""","This book, ""A Separate Peace,"" is one of the worst books I have ever read. I can honestly say that I could not understand the concept and the book to me was very hard to understand. I would actually recommend finding another book to read. The only good chapters in this book were the second and the eleventh. I am just trying to be honest."
4,This book was rather exhilirating,"I think that the book ""a Seperate Peace"" is a good book. It takes place in a setting similar to those of any school out in the country, which happen to have the priviledge of attending. The whole story is based around a relationship between the two main characters, Gene anf Finny, and there athletic and mental pursuits to out do each other. It is a good book, with lots of symbolism; a good book for anyone looking for a book about a relationship."
5,I Can Still Hear Finny's Crutches,"This is required reading for so many high-schoolers for good reason - it is one of a very few well written, complex novels dealing with important, weighty, and moral issues for teenagers. Books like this are called classics because they never lose their relevance."
5,marvelous,"The tale of true friendship, true hatred, and the jealousy in between. Beautifully written with two very real characters that you really know by the end.I, like most others, read this book for a freshman high school english class. However, unlike most of the students, not only did I actually read it, I loved it. I thought it was one of the most true books I had ever come across. It seemed to be a rare thing for me because of my taste in ""literature"" (I was a huge reader of R.L. Stine in my early teens ... I know, I know ... awful), but this book really opened my eyes. It made me appreciate true, honest, non-fear street teeny-bopper books. This book changed the way I read and definitely changed my appreciation for simple and beautiful stories. I think this book could definitely be the reason I became a literature major.A must read ... especially for young adults ... an astounding truth."
2,Not a good book to force kids to read.,"This has to be one of the most depresing books I have ever read. Basically nothing good happens the entire time and the main character has some serious head problems.. While this book might provide an interesting look into the thought patterns of an adolescent male, I do not see why it is hailed as a classic by our literary society.The best thing I found about the book was that it was short. If I had been forced into spending much more time on this piece, I do not think I would have finished it. If high school teachers want to influence kids to enjoy reading, there are much better books than this one (Ender's Game, The Belgariad, to name a couple). I think a major reason that lots of young people are convinced that they hate reading is because they were forced into reading ""intellectual"" books like this one in school. A bad practice I say."
5,A Seperate Peace,"John Knowles discusses adolescence and friendship in a way I have never seen before, this book has truly a had a positive impact on me."
4,A Seperate Peace is an interesting and well-written novel.,"A Separate Peace by John Knowles is a well-written novel. It is set during World War II at an exclusive New England prep school, and the main characters are two sixteen-year-old boys on the verge of going off to war. The characters of Gene and Phineas are very well developed and outstanding examples of characterization. Knowles also does a wonderful job adding symbolism and many different themes throughout the novel. I thought that the story was easy to follow and very entertaining."
3,An Average Book,"A Separate Peace is unlike any book I have read. I'm not sure what I think about this novel. The amount of emotional and subjective action to keep up with could be overwhelming at times. The majority of the action in this book seems like it was all in Gene's head. Reading this book was a new experience for me, which is good. I'm glad a read the book, although I would not recommend it to others."
5,"Hate, pain, and betrayal","This book is very good. It shows you the reality of friendship, and hate. It also shows you very interesting thoughts about hate, that might not always be considered."
2,Friends and enemies,"Like too many of the classics taught in American junior high and high schools, this one again deals with relationships between young males in an all-male setting. This time the setting is a private school in the New England countryside prior to WWII. Two friends, Gene and Phineas, face the rigors of school together and form a bond that will last their lives. One day however, in an adventure climbing trees, Gene shakes the branch Phineas is on, plunging him down to the ground where he is crippled. Later, a confrontation ensues between them induced by the words of others. The confrontation leads to Phineas breaking his leg, and dying in the ensuing medical procedure. Gene recalls these events as an adult later on with regret, trying to understand whether he did what he did out of malice, jealousy, hatred, etc... He, and the book comes to the conclusion that part of growing up is recognizing the evil within one self, and how controlling it is part of maturing."
2,Not the best of books...,"To say the least. I really don't know why the people who come up with high school English curriculums insist on reading books like this. There are so many better books that still fall under the ""classics"" category. I mean seriously, what high school kid enjoys reading Great Gatsby? No one, because these books are just plain stupid. Uninteresting, pointless plots, these ""coming of age"" novels are so overrated in makes me furious. So if you're not a high school kid and thinking about reading this just for pleasure, think again. It would be more pleasureable to break your kneecaps with a sledge hammer.So why did I give it 2 stars? Well, it was pretty funny when Finny fell out of the tree (although it was unintentional humor). And of course any time you have a character named ""Leper"" in a book, it's instant comedy. Especially when he goes insane.But other than that the book sucks."
2,O.K.,This book is not apropriate for the current times and was very dry. The book had characters that do not fit in our period. This book would have been better if it was placed in our time because we would understand the plot better.
2,Ugh.,"This book was not that great, certainly it may have been written with decent style and may have an excellent plot but I failed to see what the entire story was about. Finny falls from tree, Gene feels guilty... and the point is? Look, this book nearly put me to sleep everytime I tried flipping a few pages and I have read the 1000 Page Book called ""Red Storm Rising"", and it didn't put me asleep. Maybe I should stick with Clancy's Books but it was a pity that my English teacher assigned me to read the book. Christ, I can read 1000 Pages and can't read 250 or whatever it was.. and in some aspects the characters seem to be homosexuals, because they seem truely attached to one and each other or there seems to be some kind of secret relationship we don't know about. This book was well overdone...Summary: It has decent points and good structure of plot, but not for a reader like me. Maybe for someone else, but not for me.FYI I am 16."
3,"Discriptive, but not interesting","Although ""A Separate Peace"" completly went into depth of the characters, was very discriptive, and all together was ""a masterpeace of words,"" I found the plot to be unrealistic, and unintresting. The books overal story, i found to be very boring. After a while of reading, the book became a task to finish. If you are a reader who likes books of word play and discription, then i strongly recommend this book. If you are a reader who is interested in action, i do not recommend it."
3,At times just too plodding,"Like most people I read this book in high school. Curious to see if it was more illuminating as an adult I read it again. Sadly, while the book has interesting characters, it lacks enough tension to make it an enjoyable read. The best parts for me were the parts where the students were struggling to decide how, or if, to become involved in WWII. Not a bad book but I wouldn't read it a third time and probably should not have read it a second."
4,a separate peace,"This book is a good book. in the beggining it starts slow but then it picks up the pace, it starts getting personal with the characters, and all the action happens after the introduction of the characters, when Finny and Gene become real good friends.i like this book, and i think you will enjoy it too. and also watch the movie, but they act kind of gay but they are not, so dont take it the wrong way.1love"
3,A Sad Story,"The book, A Separate Peace, was about two boys and the war. It was a sad hope of trust betrayal and hate. Finny brakes his leg when Gene pushes him out of the tree. He eventually dies. Gene learns that everyone has there own peace inside and even though every one ios different we all matter"
1,No! NO! NOT SEPARATE PEACE!,"Not only does this book drag on and on, the middle is a vast expanse of nothing, which might symbolize some WWII battlefeild. Gene and Finny are the worst pairing and all the charactors seem crazy, not just Leper. Don't read this book unless your english teacher makes you!"
3,Good and yet Bad,This book was assigned as an AP English reading. I found the story interesting but since its AP....well they must make it boring in some twisted way of theirs'. We did some metaphorical analysis. Now doesn't that sound like fun? There is a lot of boring and quite convuluted metaphorical material in this little book. Overall it was a good read until the analysis part.
2,Not my type of book...,This was just not my type of book. I had picked it up and read the back and it caught me. I heard it was going to be a movie on Showtime and I enjoy reading the book before seeing the movie so I bought it! I read the first one hundred pages then quickly skimmed the last hundred...it was just not my type. Nothing kept me interested it just didn't have any punch. The characters were unrealistic.
1,Alrght book,"This book didn't interest me very well. The book put me to sleep too many times to count. Although most books do. Irony in this book was semi-interesting. The Characters were hardly developed, in my opinion. The jock and the brains as friends may funny, but it would never happen. The Death of Finny was far expected from the beginning of the book. If he doesn't have his sports to keep him busy he doesn't have anything to do that he is very good at. Sports were his prodigal purpose in life. The grim mood of the book at the beginning was a pure giveaway of the book's entire mood and foreshadowed most of the book."
1,Boredom in English class,Recently I was required to read this novel in my sophomore english class. It was one of the books where your vision starts to blur and you suddenly fall asleep. It took me three weeks to read this short novel. The only part I understood and liked was when Gene shook the tree and Phineas fell out and broke both legs. As for the rest of the book read it when you have trouble sleeping.
2,A Separate Peace,I just read the book A Separate Peace by John Knowles. I wouldn't recomend this to a student who does not enjoy reading. This book is not very catchy and doesn't really keep the reader interested. I think that is a big part of writing a book. The parts of a book that would make it interested dont really stand out. I Would not recomend this book.
1,even lisa simpson thinks this book is lame,i don't understand why they still make high school kids read this.
1,An extremely overrated novel!,"I read this book in 9th grade and it began promising, but then the second half of the book came up. Ugghh. The book is disgusting and morbid, the ending idiotic. Finny understands why Gene pushed him and accepts it!!!??? These aren't really people. This story is just a blatant rip off of the Cain and Abel story with some stupid, unecessary twists and characters who's motivations are obscure if not unlikely. Hardly as good as any one want's it to be. Read something else..."
1,Can You Say: BORING?,"I found this book to be incredibly boring and pointless. The author goes into topics that I believe he knows little about and therefore cannot understand. Also, there is way too much detail. When you write many pages describing something insignificant and unimportant, face it, you have a problem. To tell you the truth, if I could have given this book zero stars I would have. Those who classify this book as a ""classic"" definately overestimate it. Sorry John."
1,What can I say? I gave it one star.,"ok, I can understand how this book could be interesting if maybe someone else had written it or something. I was FORCED to read this stupid book for english. Well, I liked Finny. I think he was a victim of a messed up, crazy ""friend"" who just decided one day that Finny was conspiring against him. Gene may have been a good student, but he was a screwed up kid, not the brightest crayon in the box, you know? Leper was a little scary, but not as scary as Brinker Hadley. He thought he owned the world and everything in it. He need help. Anyway, if John Knowles supposedly put himself in all four of the main characters, I'm hoping the majority of himself was in Finny, because, if not, he's messed up."
4,Very Good.,"I am in 10th grade and was required to read ""A Separate Peace"" for school. I thought the book was very good, although a little short. The story was great and the characters were excellent. I wish he had devoted more time building up Gene and Finny's friendship though, so the fall would have had more impact. But all in all certainly worth reading, if you are forced to or not!"
3,Good...But I've Read Better,"""A Separate Peace"" by John Knowles was a very well written novel telling the story of a young man's journey at a boarding school during World War II. I enjoyed this book very much, but the author, John Knowles, could have cut out some of the useless parts earlier in the book. This book truly captures the values and demises of friendships, especially during a time like wartime. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed ""Catcher in the Rye"" and/or has a very deep-seeded relationship with a best friend. I disagree with one reviewer that called this a ""book for boys."" I believe it's easy to relate this to anyone's life, especially those with strong feelings toward a best friend. Overall, this book is very good, but not the best I've ever read. I think books like ""Catcher in the Rye"" are much better than this book."
3,a separate peace,"I had to read this book in my 11th grade English class. I thought that the book was a little on the boring side. Other then that it was an ok. You had the all around sports guy, the little sacred guy and the bully. The book goes back to the Devon school, which is a private school. Gene tells about all the things that happen and there is some great symbolism. the symbolism they use is in my thoughts the best part of the whole book."
1,This book is overall confusing for someone my age.,"This book had its good points, but i really didnt like it"
1,it was boring and wasted my summer.,"this book was boring,went into detail on subjects that didn't matter to the story and if i didn't have too read this book i wouldent have."
1,I did not like it. It was terrible,This book had no character what so ever. It is a book that no one can relate to and makes a big deal about some kid dying because he fell off a tree while millions of other american soldiers are on the other side of the world giving there life for there country.
1,"very boring, pointless stupid book.","I found this book extreamly hard to read. It took my entire summer. It is very boring and the author tries too hard to use dictionary words. People call it a classic, well my time is too important to read this."
1,This Book Is Not Deep Just Because People Say It Is,"This was required reading in high school, which explains why so many kids are just not interested in literature. This is definitely a minor work about some priveleged boys' minor coming-of-age issues. Why should anyone give a good goddamn?"
1,Horrible....An Overated Piece of Garbage,"This book is the most contrived, foolish, clumsy, unrealistic book i've ever read. I have read science fiction novels, set at the far reaches of the galaxy, that seem more realistic than ""A Seperate Peace"" The plot is contrived, forced, and a piece of garbage. The period references and tie ins to the world war are clumsy and stupid, with such memorable lines as ""You sound like General MacArthur!"" which seem to beat you over the head with the fact that yes, in 1942, there was a large war going on. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Ugh.,"Alright Let me stat off by saying that this book stinks. It is boring and slow . Finny is the typical egotistical Jock so he had itcoming to him for getting gene to do all of those things like skip school and go to the beach , which in the long run caused him to fail his trigonometry test. If it was me I would have also shook the branch!!!"
2,Disappointed,"The first 50 pages of this book set up what could have been a great story. Gene admired Finny--almost to the point of worshiping him. Over the summer session at school, though, he realized that Finny felt threatened by him. Although Finny was the gifted sportsman, he knew that Gene also had athletic talent. And he knew that Gene was the superior intellect. Finny knew that Gene was ""one better"" than him. This set up a conflict that I expected to build to explosion over the summer. Instead, an innocent prank turned the course of the story and it was difficult to tell where the author was going. Clearly Gene was responsible for the accident, and because he didn't confess, I expected the new course to follow the tension that was bound to build until he was exposed. Instead, the story was more a chronicle of the school year--friendships formed, subjects studied, and plans for military enlistment."
3,Just a Bit Too Much,"Alright, I read this novel for a sophomore english class and when I finished I didn't think too much of the symbolism but like every english teacher we analized this novel to no end. We discussed every symbolism possible from the two rivers( tigris and euphratees or however it is spelled) to the tree being the tree of temptation like the tree in the bible which tempted adam and eve, here it tempted gene to hurt finny. There was also too much foreshadowing, I didn't even get a fourth of the way through and I knew finny was going to die falling, from the tree or something. As I read some other reviews I noticed people saying finny and gene were homosexual, what's up with that???? The one thing that I didn't understand is the lack of discusion on girls, this is an ALL BOYS SCHOOL and you mean to tell me they never talked about girls? I would think that's all they would talk about."
3,"Good,Bad and Ugly in one","Though the book had interesting ideas about friendship, I found some of them to offcenter. Some things in the book that are incredibly unimportant are spent a long time on, while others (take for instance Finny's death, or the fall from the tree) last only a paragraph or two. This seems very disproportionate. I also found the book to be mildly depressing, and since I hate depression and believe it should be removed from everyones life, I did not especially like this book. It does, however, teach some life lessons, and this is a redeming factor. Much of this book is emotions, and symbolism, which can be difficult for some readers to stay focused with. All in all, this can be a very interesting book for some people, for others, it can be something to do when those bouts of insomnia hit. Which one of those you become depends on your character and attitude when reading this book."
5,"Knowles greatest work, stands as a tower of US listerature","This book, after all this time, remains touching, explorative, explosive, and poignant. This book truly has few faults... stunningly, it reminds me of being written not by a 40s grown American but instead an Englishman. A wonderful tragedy, about the nature of life, friendship, loss, and the search for meaning and truth in our youth."
3,"began with a small bang, ended in an inaudible whisper","The book was well enough written, but it could have been a bit more interesting. It started it very fascinating, but it really petered out toward the end, like a car out of gas. Gene came off as a jealous wimp, unable to overcome anything without his best friend, who happens to come first on his 'hit list'. The boy was self-destructive. Not only that, but the book was so dull-ly written, that after I finished it, I had no reccollection of what I'd just read. I'm going to have to read the Cliffs Notes on it just so I'll remember what happened. My advice, don't read the book unless you absolutely have to."
5,The best book ever written about the turmoils of friendship,"A friend sent this book to me as a birthday present, and it took me only a day and a half to finish it. All I can really say is that the characters in it were so real to me that I felt like I had known them all my life. Their problems while in school and how they dealt with them was so very close to what many friends face in their lives, and how they deal with problems that arise between them. I know some people may find the book boring, but to me, it is one of the finest pieces of literature ever written."
5,One of the most powerful and moving books I have ever read.,"I was forced to read this book for an English class when I was 16 and was dreading it because I had heard it was such a difficult book to understand. However, when I read the book for the second time I began to understand how wonderfully John Knowles crafted this masterpiece- every word, every image has its specific purpose and carries us deeper into the totally believable love/hate relationship of Phineas and Gene. I would recommend this book to anyone and especially to those in close friendships who will definitely be able to relate to this powerful story."
3,works well,"This devices will screw onto the camping bottles like MSR Isopro, Brunton Bruntane, GigaPower Fuel and others. You invert the bottle, as you would a bottle of butane and fill your cigarette lighter or butane torch. I purchased this adapter because the camping bottles are generally cheaper (and easier to find) than butane bottles.Sure enough, my butane soldering iron loves the isobutane mix. My Zippo Blu was less forgiving, but the device does what it says.I took off two stars because the fit was so tight I had to use some pliers to get the adapter on and off the bottles."
4,Sound good!,The strings sound good and I like the Martin quality.I have installed them on my Martin JC-16 acoustic guitar.
4,recommended,"Recommended. Good sustain after extended use. Nice ring response to the pick; still a fair tone response to bare fingers. Slurs could be better, but, it is a 12 string. Good price. Best, no shredded callouses after a long session."
3,"Not bad, but hard to read from the classroom","I put these up on the wall, and there is a lot of information in them. The print is kind of small, so it's hard to read from a distance."
1,Do Not Get iT,"This Product is a waste of time and for sure a waste of money !! Simply it does not work , i already sent it back today !!!"
1,not worth the money,"This thing costs twice as much as one from home depot and works half as well. The cannister detached from the handle, dumping the liquid inside all over the ground. When I put it back together, I failed to notice the straw that siphons up the liquid wasn't in there, so I did all my work and then realized my mistake. Then I had to redo my work. I'm returning this for a full refund as defective."
5,Great For Small Greenhouse,This is for liquid fertilizers and pesticides sold pre-mixed. Easy to use with these liquid solutions... just fill the container and set a dilution rate on the sprayer's black dial. I've been using the sprayer with VF-11 fertilizer in my small home greenhouse for my orchid collection.
4,Gilmour Dial-A-Mix Plus Sprayer is best but can leak,"I had this sprayer before and the problem was when you tipped it over the solution would leak out. For example, if you're using blue-colored copper solution to get rid of bugs or fungus, the blue can spill and stain concrete. My unit only lasts a few years then starts to leak. I'm about to order a new one since it's probably the only brand that even lasts 2 years and does a good spray job. The Ortho-brand sprayer is worthless and cracks within a few months when you're using it."
2,Not as advertised,"The yo-yo I recently bought and received today (a lime green Yomega Saber Raider) from ToysNGamesEtc was advertised as ""Brand New, Factory Sealed, Fast Shipping, Satisfaction Guaranteed."" However, upon receiving it, I noticed right away that it was not factory sealed, but had tape on the package to keep it closed. And then when I opened it, there were scuff marks on the yo-yo showing that it was obviously not brand new. And if that didn't give it away, when I twisted the yo-yo open, I noticed that the string that it came on was both black and frayed where it was around the bearing. I expected more since this was the third yo-yo I have bought from ToysNGamesEtc in the past week. The other two were as advertised, but then this one came and was not."
4,Inspiring stuff,"I remember having read an extract of ""To Sir with Love"" during my school days and have been wanting to read it ever since. Unfortunately I never got around to doing so for quite a while. Recently while browsing in a bookshop, my eyes fell on the book and I decided to pick it up.The book is an extremely inspiring autobiography which chronicles the life of a 'coloured' teacher in a particularly rowdy neighbourhood of London.Written in an extremely touching, charming (and ocassionally witty) style, the author talks about how he has to deal with racial sterotypes. It is uphill all the way for Braithwaite as he counters the cynicism of his impressionable students and, ocassionally, that of his colleagues also. Slowly, he wins over the minds (and in the case of Pamela Dare, heart) of his students as he tries to wipe clean their minds of prejudices (racial or otherwise).The book was also filmed starring the ever-charming Sidney Poitier in the lead role. See the movie after reading the book."
