5,How did I ever bake without this mat?,"I got this mat a year ago, along with a half sheet baking pan, and I use it almost every day. Everything cooks evenly and doesn't stick or burn on the bottom- pillsbury biscuits and cinnamon rolls are golden brown, and homemade french bread comes out with the most wonderful crust! Clean up is a breeze- it only takes a minute to wash off the mat, and the baking sheet stays clean and just needs a quick wipe.This is a very practical tool that you will use for everyday cooking, and is well worth the price. Buy 2."
5,Great for baking cookies,This is perfect for baking cookies. They don't stick and the Matfer keeps the bottom of the cookies the same color and doneness as the top of the cookies. It is hard to go wrong with these.
3,Exopat not great,"I ordered this thinking it would fit into my cookie sheets. It is too big, so it stick out over the top. However, the cookies on it do brown nicely. Just wish it was 2"" small all around. They say not to cut it, darn."
5,Good quality baking sheet,"Sorry to say I don't use it more often but when I do, nothing sticks and nothing burns either."
5,Fantastic!,"I bought this little gem to bake my Christmas cookies on. Clean up was a breeze, and the cookies were the best I've made in a long time. It really does work that well."
5,Bake Better Batches By Golly,"I saw these Exopat nonstock baking sheets advertised and many a well known baker uses them. I now belong to this group! What a find! No burnt, stuck-on cookies any longer. My friends want to know who baked those cookies? It couldn't be you! Would advise any baker of cookies to run out and buy now before the big baking seasons of Thanksgiving and Christmas. Send me a batch of those yum, yum cookies as a thank-you."
1,Don't try this at home if you have kids,"I bought this based on all the glowing reviews. Yet like a few others posted here. I tried them out for cookies and triggered the smoke alarm and had this horrible smell in the apartment for the rest of the day and night. I tried emailing the company but never got a response. Very disappointed and would say that if there are infant/toddlers in your house or home, I would suggest you avoid this product."

1,Not happy,"Ordered the 14"" plush PETRIE and after two weeks of sitting there I finally get shipped a 14"" LITTLE FOOT.I am NOT a happy Mama."
4,Torquemada and the Spanish Inquisition,"This is a very informative book about the Spanish Inquisition. It does a good job about explaining the laws of the inquisition for the Jews and their punishments. Though I was a little disappointed. I was expecting that this book was a biography about Torquemada, but it's not. But it is still a great book. And I recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about the Inquisition."
5,"Excellent boot, great for the price!","Soft leather, flexible yet solid sole. I've worn these so much since I received them, they're wonderful!"
4,Fair price for quality footwear,"Xmas gift for my wife and she is happy, so that is all that matters!Fair price nice looking boots."
2,A little too biased,"This book almost exclusively discusses the Sony F900 (now superceeded). The author is employed by Panavision and, at the time of writing, has no experience with other cameras.Particularly when post-production fx are required, one of the most important aspects of any electronic aquisition format is the compression ratio it employs. So I found it somewhat disturbing that this issue was entirely ignored except when critisizing the Viper for having to have a hard-disk recorder because it can't compress the image (and yet the F900 is 4:2:2 with high compression).However, the author did mention Star Wars II as an example of the quality of the Panavised camera, yet this production employed a hard-disk recorder because of the problems caused by HDCAM compression.I think the book shouldn't have such a general title when the contents are dominated by something so specific and reads like a sales brochure."
1,Not really deep,"This book is just a commercial for the HDW F900 camera and an ""ode"" to Panavision (the employer of the author). Nothing to learn from it it's just a brief intruduction on video shooting.As another reader of this book mentioned : there is nothing from a technical point of view. Nothing about compression ratios, sub-sampling, and subtilities of HD formats. And nothing about post-production.It's all about sony and Panavision and the ability of the hdcam format to equal the specifications of 35mm film (laughs). Nothing about other vendors and formats; not even a word about DVCproHD. That's really sad for a book titled ""high definition and 24p"".With many errors in this book, we feel that the author doesn't seem to have any real professionnal experience as a DP on a HD or a film project.This book should have been titled ""a brief introduction to HD and panavision hardware""."
2,Leaving Cheyenne,"When I'd gotten as far as Chapter four in this McMurtry book, I thought he was kidding his reading audience. I don't understand the premise of this book, nor his start on the subject. I tried to return it book too late on a Kindle.I loved his Lonesome Dove, the Picture Show duo and really did like Dwane's Depressed, but this Leaving left me wishing I could leave it."
3,Leaving Cheyenne,Not McMurtys best work but readable. Starts well but seems to be missing some direction. Story about the relationship of three people from youth to grave. I like his style of writing but this one seems to drag on a bit long
5,I love the West!,"Such a great, complex, and rich story. I love Gid and Johnny. The author really painted a great picture of the west.I especially liked, how he carried the story through, with three different POV's. A different, creative way.I hope that you will all check it out. IF you haven't read it yet, don't miss out."
3,Engaging,"These characters were at least engaging enough for me to finish the book. The first McMurtry I'd read in many years was ""Duane's Depressed"" and I loved it. Totally engaging. So I tried this as a follow-up and it's not as good but worth a read."
4,"Great writing, okay story","This is the first McMurtry book I have had the pleasure to read. The writing was exceptional, as McMurtry does an outstanding job of writing from the perspective each narrator. The story, however, glorifies adultry, similar to ""Bridges of Madison County"". Overall, I enjoyed the book, and look forward to reading more of McMurtry's work"
2,A struggle to read.,"It took quite a while for me to get into this book. I just finished reading Texasville prior to starting Leaving Cheyenne. I was expecting more after reading Texasville. The book was written in the manner that an uneducated early Texas settler might speak, thus making it hard at times to understand. The story is told in three intervals with each character contributing his/her point of view. Too much emphasis was put on Gid (the main character) to leave so abruptly and shift to the thoughts of the other characters. And their parts were too short in comparison to Gid's. The characters have potential and the book worked off of a similar plot, I thought, to The Man Who Rode Midnight by Elmer Kelton. I suggest reading Elmer Kelton's book before this one."
3,Leaving Cheyenne,The book itself is one of McMurtry's best. The condition of the edition I received is less than advertised.
2,Tiresome,"I love several of Larry McMurtry's early novels, such as Horseman, Pass By and The Last Picture Show. This novel is reminiscent of these great novels (all are set in Thalia, Texas), but falls short. As usual, McMurtry depicts quite flawlessly the atmosphere of growing up in Texas. The main character of Gideon is multi-dimensional and intriguing, but Molly and Johnny remain enigmas. That situation makes for a long read, especially once the main point of view shifts away from Gideon in the later half of the book. At this early point in his career, McMurtry also did not seem to understand women - seeming to view them as existing primarily to tease and please men. The story gains momentum and the characters become richer as it prgresses, but by that point, I was just wanting to get through the book."
4,"Great textbook, but older Kindle version","This is a great text that I use when teaching the English Ed class for teachers who will be teaching rhet/comp, either as dual credit or at a community college. It has a very usable balance of analysis with original theoretical articles from the field. I was excited about the Kindle edition since I like using ebooks on the big screen with my iPad, but discovered, luckily before buying it, that it is the original 2009 edition, not the current 2012 second edition. It makes a difference. I have print copies of both editions, but I would buy a Kindle version out of my own pocket if it were the second edition."
4,Christmas Gift,I started collecting Snow Village for my mom a few years ago and this was another find for the theme. Very nice addition.
4,Great Album,"Blues, rock, jazz, soul - this album is a great blend of all of these styles without diluting them into bland fusion. This album really needs to be heard by more people. Paul Garner is a talented young artist who takes old forms and injects his own experience and passion. Highly recommended. Better still is his new album - What colour will you see?"
4,Musical Satire and Mayhem,"For the Reverend Billy fans who cannot get to a live venue! Rev Billy, for the great unwashed, is the best Blues playing musical satirist on the road today! How can you not like a 6 foot, 6 inch heavily tattooed blues player whose title is ""Head of the First House of Polyesther Worship, Throbbing Horizontal Teenage Desire, Our Lady of the White Go Go Boots, Bubbling 40 watt Lava Lamp, No Pizza Delivery After 12, Shrine of the Wrestling Jesus in Chromosone North Carolina"" and all said in one breath? The Rev is great fun, but you gotta have a sense of humor and accept satire as satire. His CDs are fun also."
3,Typical guide book,Typical info nicely arranged.Some statistics and history.No investment ideas or spicifics on who invests.
2,Let's clear the record........,"The problem with this CD is the way the record company mic's Elvins drums!!! Its so boxy and closed that one wonders that the hell the engineers were thinking; is this any way to treat a king? Avoid this garbage and check out Elvins- Truth CD, or youngblood, don't mean a thing. enc. -jb"
2,"...a pretty crappy flick, way below average erotica...","I expected much more than I got...the idea is these 2 girls find a box of vintage porn and are turned on by it, the story then revolves around some pretty old vintage porn clips mixed in with these 2 girls masturbationary escapades. Lots of nudity, nothing exciting nor really erotic, infact, the vintage clips of hairy labia are quite disgusting...if old hairy bits are your thing, then go ahead get this dvd... if not, dont waste your money..."
1,As bad as it gets,This is almost the worst seduction cinema production ever. The worst spot goes to Sexual Confessions. These two are so bad you should not only be asking seduction for your money back but sending them a bill for storage as well.
4,Great for Kids,This is book is great if you want to keep your children entertained and happy. Donna has a special way of reaching the children. Great if you have Children.
4,decent buy,"I have had this drive for about three years and have only encountered one problem in all that time. The out-sourced support varies. I talked to one trained chimp who told me that the drive was dead and would never work again, apparently just to get me off the phone. I know ignorance whne I hear it though and called back in amonth. The gal I spoke to then knew exactly what my problem was and talked me through the solution in about 20 minutes. Given the dearth of ""Backpack"" products here and on the net, I suspect the company is out of business."
1,The First Christmas Tree,"Horribly disappointing. A perfect example of someone wanting to write a book who shouldn't have!The best thing about it was it was very, very short."
2,So What?,"This is one of those movies that, when all is said and done, it makes you want to ask ""So what?"" and ""Who cares?"" None of the characters has any truly redeeming qualities, the movie seeks to convey no real central compelling message. Most of the tragedies that occur to the protagonist (although it is difficult to discern who is the real protagonist here) are her own stupid fault, so again, who cares?It does throw in a lot of gratuitous titillation, lots of skin and peeping tom stuff, perverty flashes and whatnot. I'm not sure why, but it does. Again, it left this viewer asking, So what? Who cares? What's so special, you gotta make a movie out of it?"
5,Awesome,"Shipping time was quick, it is exactly what it's supposed to be. Holds a lot more than you would think as well."
3,Lots of rivers but only general info,Don't buy this book thinking you won't need another resource to run a particular river. It offers only a taste into each of these rivers.
5,Jnana Yoga,"For those who reject standard religious dogma but still recognize the certain spirituality of mankind, this book is for you. Best comprehensive explanation of the Hindu Faith I have ever read! Written for easy comprehension by the western mind."
4,Execellent description on this subject,"This book gives exceptional description on themerits of yoga. Although it was probably written100 years ago, the words used are as fresh asever. The science of Jnana Yoga was expained notjust the myths."
1,Don't be misled by Briel rep. write-ins,"Briel's espresso machines are complete junk. I had the same problems the others reviewers state. After reading the complaints about the service center and how you pay shipping both ways for warranty repairs, I have decided to junk it and count it as a lesson learned."
4,need Briel warranty repair address and telephone number,"After 3 or 4 years, my machine broke and I need to send to repair. I cannot find the address or telephone number to do so. Amazon has reports of people encountering this dilema in its review section. Please help. Reply to: asanby@yahoo.comThanks. Gracias. Tak su micket"
3,Good but hard to clean,"Overall, this is a good machine, but a few design flaws keep it from being a great machine. It brews excellent espresso with rich crema everytime. However, the grounds often stick to the inside of the machine after the espresso handle is removed. The frother attachment is made of well constructed stainless steel. This is good for durability, but makes it incredibly difficult to clean since you need to remove a hot stainless steel nut to allow the removal of a hot stainless steel froth cover. If you're willing to put up with the cleaning regiment to drink excellent espresso, this may be the machine for you."
3,Good but loses steam after a couple years,"I've had my Cadiz for about 2 years now. I've probably made about 150 cups. In the last 3 months it's started to show some serious problems. Perhaps they are fixable but I wish I didn't have to have it serviced and can't even find parts on-line. The crema stopped after about 50 cups. The more serious and recent problems are that the basket seems to be seriously clogged, despite lemon juice or vinegar cleaning treatments and maybe because or in addition to this, the seal around the basket leaks and the steam setting leaks, sending some seriously hot gasses through the grinds and diluting your just made cup of espresso if you haven't removed it. Needless to say, this also diminishes the steam pressure available for frothing. I'm starting to look for a new one."
3,Frustrated and happy all in one,"I bought this machine about 1 1/2 years ago, and absolutely love the semi-automatic features, the fact that you can steam without making coffee if you want to, but I'm frustrated with the service side. About 6 months ago, it started leaking around the basket. I called the service no. on the back of the machine and the people are downright rude. I think the phone no. goes to the shop where the people are actually working on the machines, rather than answering questions and resolving problems. I was even told to call back the next day to talk to someone else. I don't feel I've used the machine to its maximum, so I do want to send it in for service, however, finding where to send it is a big pain. I don't have the service card anymore, and don't want to call the customer service no. but it looks like i'll have to. There is nothing online for Briel as a company.I prefer this brand over my previous purchases of Krups anyday."
2,Started out good,"I bought a Briel 8 months ago. I read the customer reviews and since the majority gave it a 5 star, I ignored the bad reviews and bought one. I'm sorry I didn't pay more attention to the bad reviews. For the first 8 months, it was great. Then all of a sudden it exploded. I cleaned it and tried again and it exploded again. At present it's at the repair shop. I'm going to buy a Kitchen Aid."
1,Frother stopped at third cup,"Really wanted to like this machine for it's style, price and features. Received it yesterday and made 8 cups of espresso in the last day. The water would not pass through a double shot. Pods worked great however. On the third cup of cappacino the frother stopped working. Checked it for blockage - no problems there. Can't explain...but like others have said for similar machines, you should be able to expect an appliance like this to work...at least for a while."
4,Perhaps I can help...,"We bought a Briel Cadiz for my son for Chrostmas last year and liked it so much we bought one for ourselves when our old machine broke. For the past year I have made 5-6 cups of espresso a day, and was moderately happy with the machine, although I was sad that it didn't seem to handle finely ground coffe very well. In fact, I had some of the problems mentioned in the negative reviews; clogging, leaking, etc. The clogging seemed to get progressively worse as though the filter was wearing out.I decided to experiment with the filter and tried using pieces of filter paper inside the basket. One layer produced little or no benefit.Two layers, however, made it into a completely different machine. I can now use the finest grind on my grinder, it rarely clogs (like once every 40 cups) and the crema is rich, brown and beautiful, as good as anything we had in Argentina. Please try it, you'll be amazed."
1,buyer beware!,"When I bought this I read a few good reviews and a few bad reviews. I ordered it anyway, figuring with the name Briel that I would be safe. After using it only about 3 weeks, it started leaking water constantly from the frother part. Not just a drip, drip, but more like a trickle... to the point that I had to have a towel underneath it just to use the espresso part. Thank goodness I was able to return it. Hopefully I will have better luck with my next one..... not a Briel!!!"
1,"Looks good, but overall disappointing and defective","Given all of the rave reviews, the price, and the product description I thought that choosing the Briel Cadiz was an easy decision to make.After about a dozen brews the valve that regulates steam output no longer closes completely. Also, the instructional video was missing; although I was promised a replacement it still hasn't yet arrived in the mail.Overall, my ($) steam driven machine has offered a more reliable, trouble-free experience for over 5 years - glad I didn't throw it away when I received the Briel."
3,Not quite the best,"It does soften the corner a bit, but it is still made of pretty hard material. The sticky tape used to hold it in place doesn't hold very well either. It falls off every time I accidentally bump it."
2,Kotobukiya Robocop MK 2 Model Kit,"This item is a prepainted highly detailed resin figure that stands 85mm high. There are two points of articulation that allow the secondary arms to be extended, but that's it.I like this item because I am a Robocop fan and think the robotic design is interesting. But I was disapointed by the diminuative size of the piece and that I dont think of this as a model kit. I think that a model kit should take at least an hour to build. Thats most of the fun.This item has arms and legs that snap onto the body and do not articulate. Together with the stand, the entire kit consists of seven peices.I am very impressed with the molded detail and painting of the figure."
4,interesting!,"This is an interesting book, and hard to believe.It could use more case histories.Surely, they are available. Also, the case histories included do not seem to follow the supplement program recommended. The reasons for such deviations, when not obvious, could be detailed."
3,Nice rerecording of his classics,"This modern rerecording of Miller's classics is good, but I guess the purist in me says it's not the Glenn Miller orchestra without Glenn Miller.Still, the sound quality is obviously stellar compared to the original '30s recordings, and the band does an admirable job. The selections are entirely predictable, which might be an asset if all you want are the well-known hits."
5,super music,"This is the best Glenn Miller I have heard in a long time. I am a baby boomer and was brought up on big band music. Hearing Saint Louis Blues March like it was played is a joy to my ears, for I love that piece of music, and all the others on the cd. It is a must for any Miller fan to have in his or her collection."
3,"Oh, The Thin Line Between Big Band and Elevator Music...","First of all, Miller's successful bands were pre-WWII, so the laid-back, Basie-ish, ""cool"" swing is just plain wrong. The players here are polished and smooth-- too much so for my taste. Not that Miller was anything less than the consumate pro, but his band had bite and juice and soul (white soul, but soul).Don't get me wrong-- there's not a thing out of place here, and the sound is absolutely stunning. But I'd much rather listen to the Real Thing, hi fidelity or not, any day."
5,My fun with Learning 6 set volume,Bought this for my 7 and 4 year old grandchildren. They really like them and so do their parents. Southwestern books are always a good buy.
2,Quality is less than stellar,"The volume is crisp, and nicely audible. Unfortunately, that is the only good thing. The clip attachment for the microphone is real tiny it barely has the width to clasp onto your shirt. And a major annoyance is I accidentally bought the 2.5 mm version for my 3.5 mm phone jack. I bought a 3.5 mm female plug to convert it but it cannot be entirely seated without the volume cutting out, but I can't tell if that is a problem with the headset or the plug. It works, but barely :("
1,In Search of Scholars' Names,"As fascinating a topic as this is, I can't recommend this documentary because the scholars who were interviewed were not identified. I did recognize prominent scholar and Jesus expert John Dominic Crossan. That made me want to know who the others were even more. They all said interesting things but it's important to know their credentials. Also, the filmmakers kept showing the same images of the Bible and repeated other images as well. This production lacks authority and creativity. Next time, I'm going to stick with well-known producers such as National Geographic, PBS, and the History Channel."
5,"Wonderful Nostalgia, the 50's",I found this in the shop at a Cracker Barrel. This is a wonderful picture book and information on them from this time period. Grab this one while you can. It's worth it!
5,book was in great condition,I was very pleased with the book and the fast service. It was packed very well and in excellent condition as stated by the seller.
2,The Almost Handy Guide to the Santa Fe Trail,"Don't count on AAA or Fodor's to guide you to the wagon wheel ruts, remnants of watering wholes, or Indian ambush points along the Santa Fe Trail. On one had I was pleased to see that the noted Santa Fe Trail historian had put together a guide to the location of the remnants of the trail. Unfortunately I found details lacking, particularly when it came to local observances and current road and off-road access to the location. I was particularly disappointed by the lack of detail for the Raton, NM area of the trail."
5,Leaves nothing to be desired,"This book covers an enormous amount of information. Features such as mountains, rivers, lakes, oceans, plains, deserts, forests, glaciers -- you name it -- are described in general and then short sections are devoted to specific places (the more prominent instances of those features, such as Mt Kilimanjaro for mountains, the Yangtze for rivers, etc., but many relatively lesser known places as well). But this book goes way beyond just land/water features. It also has a timeline of Earth's geological and biological history, covers rocks and minerals, soils, ecosystems, tectonics, natural forces, climate, conservation, and much more. The pictures are spectacular, and this book is full of them. Anyone with a general interest in geography, geology, or nature will certainly enjoy this book immensely."
5,"not exhaustive, but close",a wealth of information in a well-designed and proper package. a gorgeous book. maybe too good for the coffee table....
2,Smithsonian Earth soft bound book,"Although this is a fantastic book, after about a month of normal use, the pages are coming out of the binding!"
5,Earth by Smithsonian,Definitely worth buying. I really enjoyed the pictures and the information contained in this great book. It also helps with describing scenes when writing.
5,Inspiring and Informative,"One would expect David Aikman to be a captivating writer, having been ace foreign correspondent for Time Magazine all those years. But I never expected him to be so inspiring. Taking some of the greatest contemporary lives and making them come alive on the page -- and lift us higher in life -- is a exceptional feat. In ""Great Souls"" Mr. Aikman has done it in an exceptional way."
1,A pulp version of The Long Kiss Goodnight,"What that drew me into buying Breaking Strain was the image on the front and so is an abject lesson in judging a book by its cover - this text pales in comparison to films such as Assassin and The Long Kiss Goodnight and reads instead like The Sixty Million Dollar Man. There is superfluous obsession with technical detail, such as the protagonist's cybernetic abilities. As we don't get to learn much about her before the action kicks in she remains a superficial character, and since we are privy to more than she is in her amnesiac state, she is a difficult character to relate to."
4,"Please, Send me e-mail, I want to know contents of this book","Please, Send me e-mail(atropine@hitel.net), I want to know contents of this book."
5,A CLASSIC,"A classic read Michener at his best. Great history, believable and engaging characters. A recommended read."
1,only one cassette in package,I bought this audio book and when it arrived there was only one cassette in the box. Should have been two.
1,"Pages yellowed, took forever to arrive","For starters, I ordered this at same time as other books from vendors whose delivery terms were the same; this one arrived a week later than the others; I could have used it for my trip to Alaska a week earlier! When it did arrive, while it was clean and complete, the pages were so yellowed it could hardly be read. Stated condition was USED - VERY GOOD. Not true. Also, the binding is so close to the printed text that print is obstructed unless you literally crack the spine. Some pages even then it's a real struggle to read text that was close to the binding. I understand that is a problem with the manufacturing of this book but I would expect the seller to mention such a serious problem with a 1000+ page book (or not sell it). I was very disappointed with this purchase. A great read though!"
4,Good read as always with Michener,"Slow to start....I liked how Michener mixed fact with fiction...obviously, well-researched....Long, but worth the read if you are interested in the great state of Alaska and its history"
5,Awesome. It had me captured from start to finish.,"This book was an eye opener. I know most characters were ficticious, but the events were real. My heart goes out to the indigenous people and eskimos. White colonialists were real monsters, whether Russian or American. Greed is prevailent, no matter at what cost. The book was awesome. Alaska created history from the being. It really captured me from start to finish, and I long to go a see the cities of Sitka, Juneau, Nome. And visit the Aleution Islands. No one has ever explained to me how the the earths plates moved to form continents and mountains - until now, in plain language. The way James A. Michener tells the story of the wild animals and the sockeye salmon is as though they were human beings. Great Book, Great Read. A treasure."
5,#1 book for #49 State,"Starting all the way back before Alaska was fully shaped until the BIG earthquake in the past century. WOW!!! I couldn't stop reading because I wanted to know what would happen next. Why is Russia so prominent in Alaska? Where did the eskimos come from? All these questions are answered plus you get love stories, bad guys, good buys, great ladies, and descriptions so descriptive you'll want to get a blanket because you'll feel like you are there. I've recommended this book to several friends who loved it and recommended it to others."
4,It's a text book,"What can I say, odds are you have to buy this whether you like it or not. In the off chance that you don't this one of the better Engineering text books. One huge thing is that it has a list of variables in the beginning of the book. This is NOT common in engineering text books and is a great help, especially if you are forgetful like me. It included examples that, while helpful, did not always explain their logical leaps or assumptions."
4,Great,"The book came as they said it would, and in a very timely manner. No Complaints, just respect."
4,Catholic Dynamics,"I bought found this book on a clearance table at our local bookstore, I didn't have high hopes, thinking I would get a prude peek into a Nun's or Priest's life. I couldn't put this book down, as a non catholic I expected to be lost in the dogma but the writing and author's personal perspective on the story kept me turning the pages.Manseau provides detailed stage setting and influencing factors as to why his parents followed their callings, and independently gave up their vows. As the Manseau family is affiliated and afflicted by the sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, this book is fair and non judgmental. I must say I wasn't expecting the Momma Manseau revelation and search for justice.I learned a lot about the Catholic Church and one family's tireless faith."
4,Right Piece,"I have a '98 Mercedes E320 and this is the exact wiring harness for my car. Easy to assemble with wiring colors easily displayed. Only downfall was that the RCA jacks are not labeled as to which is Rear, Front, Left, or Right. Just followed the standard coloring scheme that I found online. Violet/Purple = Right Rear, Green = Left Rear, Gray = Right Front, and White = Left Front."
3,It did the job but...,"Yes, It did the job for me but I had some difficulties because they didn't include any manual with it!"
3,"Not really a ""Murder""","I'm a fan of this series. There are good entries and less good entries. I discovered them with the Jack the Ripper volume which I like to read at night before bedtime. There are two aspects of that book I wish Geary would return to. The first is that the crime is scandalous and unsolved (as is the Borden case), the second is that none of the victims was a president!This is really not about juicy, low Victorian murders which I would think is the appeal of a series with that title. Once a president is involved you're into assasinations, which to my mind are a different thing. Curling up with a book about an assasination in which the killer is known & villified for his failings, the victim lingers, and in which all the answers are found before you're done just doesn't hold the same appeal.People who are seeking history seem to like the book."
2,Grizzly H7708 Chasing Hammer,Was pretty disappointed with this hammer. The head can be made to be acceptable for engraving with some work but the handle is totally unacceptable. A chasing hammer should have a thin springy handle and this one is like holding a 2x4. It feels much larger than any chasing hammer I've used and has an extremely poor finish.
4,Helen's Passage,This was a good book. I recomend it if you like Helen of Troy/Sparta. Also read Inside The Walls Of Troy. It is also a GREAT book.
4,Fresh Spin,A fresh spin on some great classics and a fitting tribute. A nice jazzy way to unwind after a long day.
3,"Interesting, but a shallow ending","I must say, despite the three stars, I enjoyed this book. I found the various examples of animals 'doing' mathematics very interesting. Also interesting is the section on street math; the fact that poor children in Brazil preform relatively flawless mathematics in their produce stalls, yet fail the same problems on a formal test. However, I was looking forward to something Devlin alluded to in the introduction: a way we can teach math more effectively. However, after all these countless examples, his solution was presented briefly at the final chapter. Essentially, Devlin says that conceptual math, not rote math needs to be emphasized and real life examples should be utilized more. Honestly, I would rather this have been just a fun math book for non-math minded people than have such an obvious ending. With that said, if I could I would give this book 3.5 stars because it is such an interesting read."
4,Animal Instinct and Human Psychology,"Although the word ""math"" appears in the title, this book is mainly about instinct and psychology. About half the book contains discussions on how animals instinctively do certain things that have some foundation in math. The other half of the book looks at how humans perceive and behave in math-related situations - from infancy to adulthood. The book is very well-written, very clear and easy to read. Those who are math phobic have nothing to fear here; in fact, they would likely find this book very interesting in the sense that they would learn something fascinating about themselves. Other than for those who are math phobic, this book has something for psychology buffs as well as animal lovers. But most importantly, it should grace the shelves of math educators as well as those who are interested in the reasons and possible cures for innumeracy."
3,Only Okay.,I thought there would be a little more substance to this book. I was glad to see the stories and references to some of the street math but I was more intrigued by the examples of babies and math.I would recommend it to friends that are not that interested in math.For those that want more depth to the discussion relating math to instinct I'd go elsewhere.
4,chai necklace,My daughter loves it and wears it all the time along with the hamsa necklace in the same line.
2,Sexy Alien go home,"This movie was made before 1974. Which mean the porn was very, very, soft. Sexy female alien landing in german town get to have sex with the native. Sounded good, but I have to watch a slap-stick comedy of old men chasing haft dress women in the barn, bar, police station etc... I can't say this is move you would want to see.""Run virgin Run"" had to some gag with no alien."
4,an excellent resource,"I used an earlier edition of this book and the companion Experience of Buddhism in an introductory buddhism course in college, and found (and still find) both to be exremely useful as overviews and wide-ranging sourcebooks for information about the full spectrum of buddhist practice and thought. I'm not sure what grammatical errors the previous reviewer refers to -- perhaps peculiar to the present edition -- but I grew up to be an english teacher and recall no such dramatic flaws and logical inconsistency. As textbooks, both are definitely expensive, but actually are the best resources I can think of for an overview of the whole religion rather than one specific branch of it. (Though it is true that the writing in this particular book is a bit dry -- it is a textbook, after all)."
5,Buddhist Religions,It is an excellent text which is required for a correspondance course I am taking on Buddhism which is taught by a fellow who has degrees from both Oxford and Harvard universities.
1,Bleh,Needed this book for a class in Buddhism and I'm being biased but the book sucked and the class sucked.
1,Impossible to read,Its filled with grammatical mistakes that translate into logical fallacies. It is extremely long winded and repetitive. The author goes no where with the material. I recommmend stabbing your eyes out rather than reading it.
1,"Uh, I don't think so. No...I really don't...","I pretty much hated this movie. The beginning of it was very promising, thus the one star that this review has earned, but the rest of the movie was an utter mess. The acting was the kind that you would find on a soap opera, or in a film like THE OMEGA CODE. Plus, a movie like this should not have an open ended climax where the credits just pop out of nowhere, much like the equally awful LOST SOULS. They need to send a ""sin eater"" after the writer of this script. Atleast the director tried, but lets send one after him also, you know, just for fun...SKIP IT."
3,Could Have Been A Great Mini-Series,"Great storyline, but too much to cover in a 2 hour movie.Better suited for an HBO mini-series where you could developall the characters and give the plot more time to build up.Shannyn's part was too bland, but I think that was more aproblem with the time constraint for developing all the maincharacters.Worth watching. Just a little disappointed as it fell shortof its potential."
1,All nonsense + No suspense + No horror = No good.,"There is no suspense and no horror. Yet, there are a lot of nonsense.The acting is boring."
3,Too dark for me....,"I've been trying too see all of Heath Ledger's work since his death...and he is great, as always...but the film itself just wasn't. I think it was the subject matter ( what is a sin eater?). I think one of the main reasons Heath did this film was because he had already worked with the director before on "" A Knight's Tale""...in fact this is a bit of a reunion because a couple of the actors from ""A Knight's Tale"" came back to do this film with Heath. But that wasn't enough to save it. Heath never gets to smile in this flick..let alone laugh. When it was over, I watched ""A KNight's Tale"" again just to see them all happy again and get what I had just watched off my mind. If your an avid Heath fan, then you should see this because his work in it is good. I'm glad to own it and there a couple of scenes in it that I'll watch over and over again between Heath and the girl. Just wish I could say better about the rest of the flick."
4,The Order is a delightful sin eater.,I like this movie alot. I was totally involved in the concept and it has a fine cast. I always saw more than good looks and a sexy voice in Heath Ledger and he hasn't steered me wrong. He's very versatile and I admire his choices. I love movies that invite the viewer to participate and also stir the pot sorta speak. Films that offer another perspective. I don't understand why critics dismissed this film ( especially since Brian Helgeland was doing something different ) but I'm sure glad I didn't. Its a good inventive thriller with story and performance that doesn't talk down to the viewer.
4,I LOVED this movie,"Everyone seems to not like this movie, but I LOVED IT!! I'm not one to follow the trend so don't think I'm just saying this because I have some sort of moive star crush on Heath Ledger. I loved the acting, as well as the plot! I recommend this movie to just about anyone, and can't wait for the DVD!"
2,Long on possibility. Short on delivery.,"The movie had such potential to highlight the struggle between good and evil and all the effects there-of. It had the capability to deal with a subject matter (demonology) that is often ignored by most churches and religions in ""educated"" societies; but rather than show such a battle, the movie chooses to bash the Catholic church and leave viewers scratching their heads going, ""HUH?"" All in all, rent it. Don't buy it."
1,Worst movie in years,This was the worst most unberable movie in a long time. It was postponed for a while and wasting my money to go see it showed me why. It made no sence at all. The scenes looked like they were just thown together out of order with no meaning. So many things not explained or reasons for. Dont waste the time or money on this. Any good reviews on this must be from people who dont get to the movies much because if you are a big movie goer there is no way you could have thought this to be a good movie. Check out critic reviews and you will see they were right for a change.
2,"Not Much ""Thrill"" in this ""Thriller""!","The teaming of Brian Hegeland with Heath Ledger, Mark Addy, and Shannon Sossamon produced one fantastic movie... unfortunately that movie was ""A Knight's Tale"" not ""The Order.""The movie is an unimaginative take on a promising premise:A young Catholic priest (Heath Ledger) investigating the death of his mentor discovers the existence of the ""Sin Eater."" This immortal individual performs an arcane ritual which can secure salvation for those outside the grace of the Roman Catholic Church. The current ""Sin Eater"" is weary of this burden and wants to recruit himself a replacement in Father Alex (Heath Ledger).Besides the slow pace and lack of focus, the movie's greatest flaw is the complete absence of any chemistry between the two stars. A foundation of the plot rests on Alex's (Heath Ledger) conflict between his vow of celibacy and his desire for Mara (Shannyn Sossamon). The relationship seems forced and discredits the rest of the film."
3,Middle of the road but had some moments....3 1/2 stars,"I finally got around to watching this one, this movie hadso much potential to be better, the acting was ok, the star ofthis movie had to carry the load and this young actor is prettygood at this. He's brooding with a deep voice which added to thecharacter dimension needed to pull this off. The sin-eater also had someinteresting scenes, with better actors and a tighter plot itwould have been a great chiller. The concept of the movieis creepy and I enjoyed the special effects regarding the sineater. The director was just workingwith to much material and too little budget but it had it share of moments. I couldn't give this one a 4 star review but itwas better than average actually and I'm sure it will find arental market to keep it alive. I wouldn't be surprised if ithas some sequel as it just had some loose ends still to deal with..."
3,Ok pastime,"This movie could have been a lot better. It had potential but that was not used. I must admit, ten years ago i would have loved this movie."
2,Different Film,"I rented this after watching the awesome trailer. About halfway through I began to wonder if I'd rented the wrong thing. First off, the trailer makes it look like an entirely different film than it really is. The trailer says that a rogue priest must battle an ancient evil summoned by a corrupt order of priests. Cool, it sounds. The film is actually about a rogue priest's mentor dying and of a being called the ""sin eater"". The premise isn't half bad, but next time, advertise the right thing!"
1,among the worst,"This is among the worst movies I've ever seen. I can't think of a powerful enough word to describe how idiotic the ""plot"" is. Sin eater? Please...more like $$$ eater. Save your money. I wouldn't even rent it.Plot...zero. Special effects...non-existent. Creepy factor...it was a joke & not even a little creepy. Seriously folks, I'm not that hard to please & this movie pissed me off it sucked so bad.Cheers..."
2,Disappointing,"Hmm ... what can you expect from Heath Ledger ?Only director with magic wand could change him, for example; Ang Lee."
3,Interesting Plot,"I give the film props for its original storyline (writer and director Brian Helgeland), excellent acting by the primary players, Heath Ledger and Benno Furmann, as well as the great acting of the supporting players, especially Peter Weller.The film (from my DVD viewing) is a well paced fantasy and psychological thriller. The subject matter is the often tred good versus evil but is sufficiently blurred and complex so as to add to the tense struggle that ensues.Bottom line: an absorbing film and better than many critic reviews."
1,An Order For Morons,"This film had the possibility to at least entertain but instead it tanked into a boring formula vampire film. I wouldn't even suggest looking at this on a Sunday night when there is nothing else on TV, its that bad. It concerns a priest (Ledger in a miscast role) and his attempt to find out about a ""sin eater"" played by a German actor who was in a few German hits who can't speak English and he's dull and boring. There is no emotional response in the film, it does nothing at all. ...."
1,A Huge Letdown,"The synopsis on the back cover was intriguing. The ideas introduced within the movie were interesting. The follow through was non-existent.I was left with so many questions. I still don't understand what significance - if any - was held by some of the characters. Indeed, most of the players seemed very undeveloped. Was the antagonist really evil, neutral, anything? There were so many fascinating concepts and challenges put forth. None were resolved. Worst, the end of the movie snuck upon me. I was left feeling very unfulfilled.I don't think this one is worth seeing even as a dollar rental."
2,Mediocre despite all the right ingridients,Despite a great cast (Heath Ledger is the the most tragic loss to acting of his generation.) And a halfway decent plot something was missing. The production and the writing bring it down.
2,Wow! Vatican City has a Secret Rave Bar?,"There's a plausible premise for a horror film in this hodge podge of a movie - unfortunately, any discovery of it is three or four script rewrites beyond the version currently being served up. Even if you can wait till the third act, when the movie starts to pick up steam and supplies a little intrigue, you still have to sit through a number of ridiculously stultifying scenes and some of the most god-awful, dull dialogue imaginable for the first hour. The directorial and writing lapses are so shoddy and glaring they're near unforgivable - but don't take my word for this - just look at the actors' embarrassed faces as they mumble through this stuff."
3,Poor Switch,This switch worked for about 1 year and quit. When it did work there were times that the network seemed to stop functioning. Our new router has eliminated the periodic network stopages and has taken up where this switch left off.
3,Alice - Not funny. Not fun. Not even stereo.,"I must say that Alice was very polite. The animation was very clean and consistent, except for one cartoon about some oysters. However, I found the story hard to watch. I didn't get a sense that this story had a point. You know a beginning, a middle and an end that were connected. I was also disappointed that the sound was MONO. One of the main reasons people buy a DVD formated title is to get good sound, including left and right channels. I'm sure Disney will repair that some day if they think there is enough money in it."
1,"cant rate it, as it has not arrived... YET...",CANT RATE IT.. as it has not arrived yet.. wait till i get it before asking me to review it.
3,a child's gift,"As these (two) Aice in Wonderland DVD's were purchased as gifts, my only feedback is that they were very much enjoyed"
3,I'm late! I'm late!,But before I go my review is -Seemed dated - not classic. watch the Johnny Dep version- way more enjoyable
1,Disappointed,I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter. It doesn't work!! It skips and jumps and it's nothing but junk. We were both so disappointed.
4,Definitely Odd,"Terrific animation, very beautifully done. The production values are outstanding, as this is from the Classic Disney period. Thus the 4 star rating. However, the movie consists of several episodes which don't blend together very smoothly. And the characters Alice meets are nearly all really weird or nasty, which is not very appealing to a young child. (I don't see how a walrus tricking baby clams to leave their mother, only to be eaten, is good child entertainment). We have bought several other Disney classics which our daughter enjoys more. But she did like this one to a certain extent, as she sympathized with Alice.The songs in this movie were not as catchy as those in other Disney productions, such as Peter Pan and Cinderella.There is a strong irony to this movie, as Disney was all about creating magical fantasy worlds, and Alice in Wonderland is about how a fantasy world can be bizarre, sad, and ultimately dangerous. Wonderland is not wonderful at all."
5,The best animated movie ever,"I think this movie is absolutly incredable. I grew up watching Disney movies because they took me to another world where i could be someone else for the moment. In this movie, I didn't just get to stay in the beast's castle, or under the sea, I got to make believe in bread butterflies, singing daisies, a mad tea party, and the coolest little caterpillar i've ever seen! Alice went on quite an adventure and I was happy to share in it with her. Alice reminds me of myself as a little girl. Always zoning out into another world when i'm supposed to be doing something important. Everyone go out and buy it if you havent already!"
5,"its a great movie, but wait until 2004 for the 2-disc ver.","I love this movie, i had it on VHS from the 80s, however, it got wrecked, i was going to buy this gold collection version, however, when i bought Sleeping Beauty Special Edition on DVD, it came with a booklet and said that in sometime in 2004. Disney will reissue this film in a 2-disc special edition. The 2-disc will probably show the film im widescreen. So everyone If u can wait, save your money for the 2-disc special edition of this film! Alice in wonderland is a great movie, i highly recommend it!"
3,Not Widescreen?,Am I mistaken? It looks as if this SuperDuperSpecialWhatever Edition is in Pan and scan. I can find no information on a widescreen version. Can anyone help?
1,Wait for blu ray,If you haven't picked up this UN-anniversary DVD Wait for the 60th anniversary Blu ray that has just been announced for early 2011.
2,Very annoying,"Am I the only who thinks this film is highly annoying? I mean I just want to punch that Cheshire cat on the nose. The pink elephant scene in Dumbo, the entire Fantasia and Alice, what were Walt and his buddies smoking? I know the acid heads loved to drop some and watch Fantasia.I can watch Snow White and Pinocchio over and over again, but this movie drives me insane. Maybe I'm too cerebral?The quality of the filmmaking is, of course, stellar and second to none."
1,It stinks!,"This movie is nothing like the original book, skip it and watch the Hallmark version instead."
1,Right title wrong movie ( falsly advertised ),"I recieved within a week, however it was not the movie I ordered ""Alice in Wonderland"" the classic cartoon, and recieved ""the movie"" that was made it 1999 and directed by Nick Willing, not Kathryn Beaumont. I was disapointed, since it was a movie for my daughter."
5,A Disney's Classic,It's a nice animation if you have kids or not. You can't miss it on your collection.
5,I own the special edition,If you are a true Disney fan you have to have this for your collection. I had this on VHS for years and finally waited for the Special Edition. I didn't want to replace my VHS Disney collection to all DVD but when you see all the special features on the new DVD it's hard to resist.Little ones may find the movie a little startling but it is a classic.
5,The Definative Version,"This is the definative version of Alice in Wonderland, one of my favorite Disney cartoons. It is presented in its original format of 4:3 (for the person wondering about widescreen, it was not used until 1953, two years after the release of the movie; Disney's 1st widescreen movie was Sleeping Beauty), with beautiful colors in the new transfer. The movie stays very close to the two Lewis Carol books, and has many great extra features. Highly recommended."
5,Love!,I love Alice in wonderland. Children's movies can't get any better than this. Every generation should watch Alice in wonderland
5,Good movie!,"My 3 yr old daughter loves this movie, great classic. Interesting characters, and songs for kids. She likes the animation."
3,New Edition Coming,"Just a quick note here - if you are thinking of purchasing a copy of Alice in Wonderland now, just wait a little longer.As of January 27, 2004, Disney is doing a ""Special Edition"", two disc DVD release that will be similar to thier recent reissue of Sleeping Beauty.With all of the features that will be on that DVD, people who buy this DVD now will be disappointed if they don't wait.Disney will be including all of the ""Making of"", pre-production art, and other features that make their new ""Special Editions"" great, to this new edition.There are three other ""Special Editions"" due in 2004 - Mary Poppins, Lilo and Stitch, and Pocahontas. Alice will be the first released in 2004. Also, there's the ""Platinum"" edition of Aladdin in October 2004. Worth waiting for in my opinion. You have been warned. :-)"
5,Alice in Wonderland (1951) ~ Kathryn Beaumont,"I love this film and it will forever be my favorite Disney film. I have always been a total off the wall funny guy who prefers nonsense to the everyday stressed and boring real world. Its amazing the stupid things people get so serious or stressed about in todays world; their job, driving, their relationships, etc, etc...i can relate to Alice and her desire to escape to a wonderland of nonsense, but this movie delivers an important message about how you need a little bit of serious and nonsense. All serious or all nonsense is never tolerable.This DVD is great for children or fans of the story. I am 23 and I still love this movie. The DVD has some great extras including some behind the scenes films of how the movie was made. Its amazing the amount of work that Disney put into his movies and it really shows in his old classics. His animators where far ahead of their time and the fluidity of the cartoons still outrank many of todays cartoons."
2,My least favorite Disney film,"This is perhaps my least favorite of the classic Disney animation features... It's a cluttered muddle that simply does not capture the essence of the Lewis Carroll books, mainly because Carroll's subtle humor is buried under an avalanche of Disney kitsch, but also because Disney failed to capture the willful, prickly spirit of the Alice character... or indeed, to give her any personality at all.The real problem isn't that this adaptation dilutes or distorts the original story, it's that it just isn't a very good film -- the script is disjointed and confusing and the animation follows suit. Obviously, it being a Disney film, there are millions of people who love it, so take what I say with a grain of salt... just look at the hundreds of ""five star"" reviews that surround mine. But I honestly can't recommend this one. I think it's a dud. (Axton)"
1,BORING...BORING...BORING,"Not one of Disney's better animated films, this 1951 adaptation of the Lewis Carroll classic is pretty lame. The songs are one-note. The dialogue is uninspired. Do yourself a favor. Skip it and read the book. UGH!"
1,Loses Spirit of Author and Disney,"I was so disappointed after reviewing this with my 3 year old grandson. For some unknown reason, ""they"" decided to make this a more contemporary version. It's too fast, jumps all over the place, too many animation details, redone characters don't fit the story, the original songs are revised, cut short, and hyped-up, to give just a few examples. I am at a complete loss to understand why this wonderful story had to be tinkered with. I sure hope they don't do this to Bambi, Pinoccio, or the original Pooh. The reason these originals are so valuable, (especially Pooh), is that the characters have personalities. They relate to one another and they take time to have a conversation and work on mutual problem solving or just having simple fun. They teach a moral that doesn't get lost in the quest of being ""modern"". My three grandchildren, age 3, age 3 1/2, and age 5, are inthralled with the originals. They can even sing, completely, every song in each."
1,Alice in Wonderland Masterpiece Edition,I believe this to be a bootlegged copy of the original Disney DVD. I contacted the seller and was given a refund. I hope no one else buys from this party. I have also contacted Disney about my concerns.
3,FULLSCREEN ONLY?,"I thought the Blu Ray version would be in widescreen, but it is not. This release is far inferior to the Sleeping Beauty release. Sleeping Beauty had 7.1 surround sound and was widescreen, this is not, even though it is a latter release. It's a classic, no question, but I don't seem the point of having the Blu Ray verision. It seems like an upscaled dvd on a blu ray disc. Definately a dissapointment since most Disney Blu-rays thus far have been incredible. It's worth buying if you only have it on video, but I wouldn't bother upgrading to blu ray if you have the DVD version. Hope that Jungle Book comes out soon on Blu Ray and gets the Sleeping Beauty treatment."
3,What a damn shame,Disney did a pretty excellent job with the Audio quality but when it come's to the picture you'll find that it has really good colors and you can see the difference between a SD and a HD except it's not in either wide screen or full screen ?!!Thanks for ruining one of your best masterpieces .
3,Always a favorite,"From the start, Alice has been one of my favorite films by Disney.Sure, I haven't rented the DVD but I recently saw this movie again and I thought it was very charming. I could give it more stars, but my only problem with it is that it doesn't have a heart. Still, it's fun.I still use lines in the film in my daily vocabulary (""Serpent!"" and ""I have an excellent idea...let's change the subject"" are just two.) The best sequences in the film are all supervised or animated by the same guy...Ward Kimball. Those two scenes are the Cheshire Cat, and the Mad Tea Party.Overall, my sentimental favorite film by Disney, because I used to know it inside out."
4,"Good, but Weird.","This is a great animation movie for Disney and non disney lovers. It has some really funny and great parts in it, like the unbirthday part, (Which is incredibal) and the Caterpiller sceen (Which is also great). But the problem with this movie is that it's a little too weird for a kids movie. Just stick in a few curses, take out the songs, and Walla! You Got an adults movie!"
5,...We.re all mad here...,"This has got to be the best Disney story ever! Even though the story was written by Lewis Carrol, I still think that Disney's interpretation of the story was grand. The illistrations were soo cute. Not to put down the original Tenniel illistrations of course. I just think it's good that Disney can make an animated film that doesn't have to do with a princess. (="
5,A Disney Classic!,"Alice and Wonderland is wonderful in so many ways! It's so fun and entertaining that it's hard to describe. You'll get the songs stuck in your head! OK, ok... Just to let you know, if you want a DVD collection with classics, you'll definitely have to get Disney's Alice in Wonderland. It's a great DVD with cool features."
5,Great Story,"I wonder what Lewis Carroll was taking when he wrote this book. Just look at Alice as she takes one pill to grow big, then one pill to grow small. This story that takes you through the dreamy mind of Alice. If you really good close you'll see some political satire from the time of Lewis Carroll. Example: The small king and the really fat queen running after the free thinker Alice, Alice being thrown out of the flower garden because she's not their social type. This story was really ahead of its time, I guess Lewis Carroll had to make it a childrens story; a great story for both children and adults."
1,Disc did not work and we are sending it back,"The two-disc special was a Christmas gift for our granddaughter, 4 and the oldest of 3 grandkids. It did not work and she was very disappointed. We are returning the item."
3,Skipped and paused a few times,"It skipped a few times, and paused a few times about 30 minutes into the movie. After that it was fine."
5,A loving gift to my daughter of the Alice in Wonderland Classic,I purchased to replace my old vhs that my daughter wore out a child. when it came it i gave as a gift and we all sat down to watch this family fun classic of Alice in Wonderland as she goes through her adventure. high recommend. a timely fun classic by walt disney. thank you to the seller for a grand overall experience in all areas.
5,Amazing quality Blu Ray for a Disney Classic.,"I'll keep this short as everyone knows how good this Disney Classic is.The transfer onto Blu Ray is nothing short of fantastic! The colours, vibrancy and clarity are all there making it a treat to watch. The audio track is also amazing, its like watching this movie all over again with everything combined. The disc itself is Region A, B & C, in case you're purchasing from overseas, a gamble which I took.In short, it's a must buy for any Disney fan."
5,Off with her head!!!!,My kids watched this movie so many times over and over that I'll bet we are burning out the DVD player and the disk. The digitally remastered version is much nicer to watch than the old version-it is much more crisp and sharp. I would recommend this movie to kids who are 3 or older-the story would be a bit too confusing to kids younger than that. It is a no brainer on this one-get it for your kids!!!
3,Bummer choice for default Audio,"Much has been written on this film, some of the finest work done under Walt's direction. I'll restrict my comments to the blu-ray itself.This picture quality is indeed superb and makes this blu-ray very much worthwhile.Unfortunately, the advertised DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix must be proactively selected. Unlike most Disney Classics Blu-rays, the default on Alice is stereo Dolby Digital. That's a shame, because the lossless DTS-HD MA track is very well done and nicely balanced. Given the importance of audio on the blu-ray format (and frankly, to Disney Animation), unless someone can provide a good reason for defaulting to lossy, stereo, Dolby Digital, i'm docking this otherwise beautiful transfer 2 stars."
3,Alice in Wonderland,The disk is ok but only the movie disk works on my dvd. The second disk does not work
1,Wow why buy a non functional blu ray?,"It is amazing to me that Blu Ray technology has now been out for as long as it has, and it still doesn't work.I always buy the blu ray dvd combos hoping for a great blu ray experience but expecting to have to watch dvd.This one is a dvd type. Blu ray doesnt work Yay Disney!"
3,"great movie, something wrong with dvd","I love this movie, and everything but there is a problem with the dvd on the second discs still gallery it stops and goes to the dvd screen saver. I bought this at Wal-mart and am planning on returning it, hopefully I just got a bad disc I did notice siginfigant scratches on the disc. This is just a warning to all the disney buffs out threre. However the disc one plays fine. I hope we don't have another Two Towers exteneded edtion dvd bug on our hands."
1,Cancel this item,Neither appropriate for kids nor for adults. This movie is boring and confusing at the same time. Don't buy it.
1,not like the original,"This is a Disney failure, not like the original version I had hoped to find. It features an older Alice with a different story line, although many scenes do follow the book. We watched it once and then donated it to a local library. I still want to find an original classic version as I remember it to have been."
1,Makes No sense,I had to watch this movie one time and i got to say that this movie makes no sense at all.None.Some girl sits on a tree and some woman takes her to some place with dancing silverware.Keep Your Money.
3,Bonus Features Not So Great,"The Cartoon itself is a classic. I really enjoyed that. However, the special features were at best mediocre. The games are very misleading, they really aren't games at all. The extra song for the cheshire cat was done as a 'video' in a way, with clips from the movie.I think that if you're buying it for the extra features, you're going to be severely let down."
2,Will not play on Panasonic BD35,"I called Disney technical support and they told me this Blu-ray will not play all features on my Panasonic BD35 Player. Yes, the main feature will play but none of the Special Features will load. They said this was a known issue! Now I have to wait to see if Panasonic will provide a firmware update to fix the problem. Signed, Annoyed."
5,A Wonderful Story Brillianty Animated,"Walt Disney has brought to life many classic children stories, and Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland could be no exception. The Disney Company actually mixed both Alice's stories (""Alice's Adventures In Wonderland"" and ""Through The Looking Glass"") into one, resulting and extraordinary masterpiece with beautiful animation, extraordinary music, unforgettable charachters and all the non-sense of that wonderful place called Wonderland. A true Disney classic. END"
4,Classic,getting a original alice in wonderland is no easy task and there is a very good reason this is a excellent movie and definitely a most own classic
4,classic,"no, really? do i need to review this? if you know it - its everything you know, if you dont - well its about time you watch it!:)"
5,Perfect UN-anniversary edition,"The movie is as funny as I remembered, nd even better, since the image and the sound has been restored and remastered digitally, and it's amazing. The extras are very interesting, adn sometimes a bit boring when you check on the old documentaries, but seen with perspective, I think it's a great research work from the editors to release such a good edition. Pity that they haven't done the same here in Spain with the Spanish speial edition, only one disc edition and poor in extras."
4,I had missed this classic,I have been a fan of all Disney animated films since my childhood and hope to own them all but then they came up with the Disney vault -_- anywho I was watching the version with Whoopi Goldberg and I couldn't remember the last time I had seen this one I definitely missed it the others just don't compare.
5,A Classic Forever,"I remember watching this in elementary school days. I'm in my late 60's. It's still wonderful, especially the caterpillar blowing smoke rings. My granddaughters love it, too."
5,Classic Alice in Wonderland - as great as I remember,"I bought this movie for my three year old daughter, and she loves Alice just as much as her mama did. :)"
5,Wonderful,Bought this for my grandchildren.They love it and watch it over and over. Nice to see real amination and not computer generated.
4,If you care about Disney Movie Rewards and the slip-on commemorative cover...,"For anyone out there [like me] who is a Disney Movie Rewards member, this is not an eligible movie. I bought this movie to update my Disney collection and also because I wanted to rack up the points for the Disney Movie Rewards program. The rest of the classic [digitally remastered] DVDs that I've purchased from a regular retail store has always come with insert [code], but this one [and Cinderella] did not. They also did not have the commemorative slip-on cover. It was just the plain DVD case. Which is fine, but it did not match the rest of my collection. Other than that, the movie's great and my order came on time."
3,"Good, but dissapointed","I love the movie itself, but i was extremely dissapointented that the outer slip cover didn't come with the movie. I usually try to collect movies with them, and from the pictures it looked like it had one. Oh well."
2,Not Disney's best work.,"If Lewis Carroll had seen this he would have disliked it so much that he would have refused to have his name in the opening credits. Just like Michale Ende did with the film version of his ""The Neverending Story"". They ommited a lot of things. In the book the Knave of Hearts is on trial for stealing the tarts. In the film Alice is on trial for causing the Queen to lose her temper. And they leave out some important characters. The Duchess, the Frog Footman, Humpty Dumpty and the White Knight. They said that this film had no ""heart"" I saw a Warner Brothers version that had as much heart as this one had comedy. But the Childrens Company Theater version is my favorite."
3,Surprisingly Disappointing,"I'm a fan of top-of-the-line cartooning, and happily recognize that Disney is among the masters (the relatively little-known ""Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad"" is one of my favorites). True, recent ones haven't been up to par -- too treacly, preachy, or, worst of all, politically correct. But 1951's ""Alice in Wonderland"" has all the artistry, charm, and magic one expects from Disney's Golden Age. That being said, and despite some terrific moments and scenes, I was dismayed by the lack of thought and effort that went into this interpretation of the Lewis Carroll classic. In addition to some unexpected tedium, the plot was disjointed, and never really built on itself or went anywhere. Worst of all was the ending, which was abrupt and unsatisfying. All in all, a very flat production that I regretfully can't recommend."
1,Read the book instead!,"Even as a little girl, when this first came out, I was disappointed in it. Disney later admitted that he undertook his version before reading Alice, and discovered that he didn't like the main character!It shows.Disney's Alice is not the critical observer Carroll created at all. She is indistinguishable from all of that era's Disney heroines - helplessly feminine and mindless, but sweet. Thank goodness everyone has moved on.Unfortunately this is a film that (like Wuthering Heights) had yet to be made. But maybe that's not so bad. Alice is all about narrative, nonsense, and a subtle humor that makes the book suitable for reading at any age.Read the book."
2,The bouns features of review of Alice in Wonderland !,The best bouns features on the 2 disc set of the masterpeice is the behindthe concept and scene of Alice in Wonderland !Bring my favorite storybook read long to life as a child in the flim !I love the storybook concept deleted scenes on the 2 disc set of Alice in Wonderland !
5,Absolutely Pristine!,"Bravo, Disney! After reading the glowing reviews of this highly underrated Disney Classic, I finally picked up a copy today. Thinking I would hit 'Play' and do some work while it provided some background noise, I found myself glued to the screen for the entire film. The Blu-ray edition is nothing short of a miracle; pristine from beginning to end! Grab your copy before it goes back into the vault. You won't be disappointed."
5,"yes,say it","The band Kyus birthed a fine bunch of bands and music after they laid down their music.I am a QOTSA fan and garcia is not dissapointing with this album.If you like QOTSA or Kyus,you'll like Hermano."
2,Subpar 2nd Effort,"Being a huge Garcia fan, I was pretty pleased with Hermano's 1st album. For me, this album was a huge dropoff from that effort. For lack of a better term, this album was BORING. The songwriting is the big disappointment, and proves that a talented singer can only do so much with lackluster material. Kyuss and Unida will have to suffice for now."
2,"Sorry to say, but this album is a dissapointment","Well, I finally got my copy of ""Dare I Say"" in the mail yesterday and sadly, I am dissapointed with it. I've come to love pretty much everything that John Garcia has been a part of, including every Kyuss album (except for Wretch), Unida, and Hermano's first album. Although the first album is short, it is far superior to this sophomore effort. There just really aren't any songs that stand out. ""My Boy"" and ""Life"" are the only ones that I really can see myself listening to in the future, and neither of them hold a candle to Kyuss' best. Trust me, I really hate to write this and bag on one of my favorite musicians, but this album really doesn't do it for me. I'd say if you want to check out true material from Garcia, then definitely go out and grab some Kyuss as mentioned above, or Hermano's first album, ""Only a Suggestion."""
3,From the master of suspense.,"The book Nightmare is a collection of six short stories by legendary writer Cornell Woolrich. Any one of them would be suitable material for an episode of The Twilight Zone.The six stories are:- I'll Take You Home, Kathleen- Screen-test- I O U- Three O'Clock- Nightmare- BequestEach of these stories contain generous helpings of Woolrich's favorite literary ingredients. Namely; horror, dread, terror and, most especially, suspense.The descriptive prose used by Woolrich is very richly crafted and demonstrates what a stickler for detail he was. Paradoxically, in many cases, this attention to the finer points of narrative artistry did not extend to plot development. Most of the stories contained in Nightmare have gaping holes in the plot and display an almost willful disregard for plausibility.Recommended to readers who appreciate fiction saturated with suspense and are not put off by plotting that is less than airtight."
2,"Lurtz, buy with caution","I resently ordered this item. I isn't a very good likeness of the charater, and the white hand on his face isn't as bold as the picture.Now the arrow launching. I've tried several times, and I've gotten very few good launches. He can't hold the arrows in a position for very long, and he can't pull the arrow and string back very far. This is a very flimsy designBesides that, he is a very good figure. He stands very well, and a good leader of any evil army.This figure is fun, but if you think he's like the picture, guess again!!"
2,Licks just sound bad...,"This book has lots of licks, but the licks aren't very practical for any style of playing. None of them particularly stand out as musical, or something that I would want to put into a guitar solo. I was very disappointed with this book and wish I hadn't purchased it."
1,Not too happy,"We bought this Mongoose bike on Amazon but it really hasn't been a good experience. We bought the bike in November 2009. My son and I put the bike together and when it came down to putting on the front wheel, we found the rim was bent. We contacted Amazon and they told us that we could either (i) take a discount, (ii) buy another wheel on our own, or (iii) return the entire bike and they would replace it. We took option (iii) and dismantled the bike, packed it back in the shipping box and waited for the new bike to show up a few days later. We got all the parts the second time around. However, when my son started riding the bike up hills, the gears started to skip. We have contacted Mongoose customer service but have not heard anything back. We may have to pay for servicing the gears and that is too bad. The bike is nice to look at but its not like the great Mongoose bikes we have had in our family to date. Buyer beware!"
4,Maxim,"I purchased this bike from a local store, but I wanted to write a quick review and put in my two cents. This bike has been pretty great so far. The only complaint is I had to have a friend adjust the deraillers to get the shifting down good. That is probably the stores bike assemblers fault though. The only real complaint is the seat was like a rock so I ordered a cloud 9 seat off of amazon and it is great. I also ordered aluminum pedals just beacuse I have heard the plastic ones bust other than that the bike is excellent especially for the price dont hesitate."
4,Nice bike for the money,"This is a pretty nice bike for the money, would have been nice for the seller to include an allen wrench with the bike to make assembly easier with out having to run out to the store. This bike also does not have a quick release front tire but that is a minor detail. Over all great looking bike would deff. recomend it to a friend."
4,Good for the price,"When this bike arrived via UPS the first thing I noticed was the front forks were bent about 30 degrees. Needless to say this made the bike useless. However, I contacted WSports, told them the problem, and they immediately shipped out a new front fork. The new part arrived in about 3 days. Since this was a birthday present it made it late, however I can't blame WSports for this since it seems like it was a shipping issue. In fact I would give kudos to WSports for their fast response time in this! Thanks WSports!Aside from the original damage the bike itself is pretty nice. But, like other reviews have stated, be ready to use your last reserves of patience when you adjust the brakes and gears. It is not a 5 minutes job. But once completed the bike is fantastic. It costs under $200 so you are getting that type of quality, but for my wife's purposes that is great enough."
4,Mongoose maxim mountain bike,"It is great. Perfect for casual rider. The only challenge I've had is the chainnbrokemon me one afternoon while riding. Not sure why it broke if it was faulty chain or ""user"" error, haha. But it was a really simple and inexpensive fix. No issues since then."
3,Not really as good as I initially thought,"I'm an amateur bike rider (just getting started) and really liked the bike at first. After taking it on a trail with my friend yesterday, I'm selling it to my neighbor. I'm 6'2"" and about 230. The bike just doesn't fit me. In addition, on hills it takes alot of effort even in the lowest gear. It's probably fine for a smaller person or kid who just wants to ride around the neighborhood but if you want to hit the trails or have alot of hills, I'd get something else. One more thing, the seat is hard."
3,better off looking,"I recently purchased this bike for myself. After assembly of the bike, I noticed the poor construction, junk components, and typical hallmarks of an inferior bike. Definitely a good looking bike, but nothing to be used for the real trails. You are better off looking elsewhere."
1,Not good,Bike gear mechanism broke within days. Very disappointed and thinking about returning (which will be a pain due to size).
3,MGX DXR,Overall a good bike....mine WAS fun to ride but one day my friend and i were hitting a ten foot dirt jump and the rear suspension collapsed on the way up the jump which propelled me face first over the handlebars into the dirt. Now u can ride it because the little bar that runs perpendicular to the seat is press so hard against the tire that in cant spin AT ALL. Also the pedals are touching the ground. Maybe a good bike to tool around the neighborhood or some mild mtb with but not for dirt jumping and what not. I have emailed mongoose about spare parts...no reply so far.
4,cc,"ok i got the bike and it works just fine and being a girl i put this thing together in a matter of 10 min, took it for a ride and gave my legs a huge work out. i like it for the price i paid. but looks like im giving it to my son now."
5,Symphonic baby steps,"Before there were the symphonies of Mozart and Beethoven, William Boyce was composing the musical baby steps which would lead to the development of symphonies. His music is lovely and moving, and I have long wished that he would be given more exposure. It seems as if my wish might come true as I have heard of release of more of his music lately. Boyce's symphonies are more like what we would call movements - short and sweet. All eight of these symphonies take only an hour to listen to. This version of his eight symphonies taken in hand by the great Sir Neville Marriner and the Orchestra of St. Martin's of the Fields is a good place to start. This is a fine addition to anyone's music collection."
2,"so far, not so good *** See Update ***","I received my new shoes this afternoon and took a test run. I didn't really buy this a3 for its ""functionality"" but rather the look. I thought the honey comb and the color combination look kinda cool. However, I DID NOT at all feel being ""propelled through every foot"", and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff. I even poked it with my hand, oh man it's hard. I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness, but all I did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement.BTW, if your feet are wide and flat like mine, it's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes.*** UPdate *** November 15, 2006It's been 2 months since I've been wearing these shoes, and I've changed my opinion them. Once you get use to the a3 sequence, they are actually quite comfortable. The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now. Maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible."
4,Good shoe for the price,"Shoe pretty true to size, good shoe for the money. I buy Nike Shox often and decided to try these for the price. Not as cushy as a Nike Shox but also half the cost or less! For the price it is a comfy shoe and I would recommend it if you have wider feet and or don't want to send $90.00 and up for Shox."
2,Very hard to keep clean!,Well I guess the title says most of it. I am not happy with them they turn a dark brown just walking across the yard so I have to put them in the washing machine with bleach A LOT. Then the place where the laces go at the top are all frayed. I've tried to was them by hand with bleach so it wont fry but it dosen't work they look the same as before. But they are comfortable I also like the high arch in them. They are pretty when they fist come out of the box but if you are planing on doing any outdoor actives I wouldn't recommend them.
5,"To much Bass, To much Quake, Loook at that Booty Shake....",This cd here is pretty good too .. You will be able to find a few most of the cd ....The bass sounds alright too..Its worth it ..
4,pretty good book: medieval women,Good history of important medieval women. A little difficult to read--you need to focus.
4,Goodbye,"This is a pretty good sendoff for Blink 182. A nice blend of singles from the early albums to the more polished recent ones. All the songs are catchy and most were hit singles. I did notice that Anthem Part 2 was omitted for some reason. The two unreleased bonus songs are good, but nothing spectacular. I liked this group and will be sad to see them go seperate ways. Check out their site to find out all of the bandmembers solo projects."
5,Great CD!,Blink 182 is just fun high energy music and these are their greatest hits. What's not to like? It's a great CD.
5,Blink Greatest Hits,"Blink-182 was an excellent band, and this greatest hits is a pretty decent compilation of their ""hit"" songs. I would say it's mainly for those that liked what they heard of Blink on the radio but didn't want to buy all of their albums. I purchased the ""Greatest Hits"" because of the song ""Man Overboard."" It's possibly my favorite Blink song ever and was only available on ""The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show"" which you can't buy anymore. The ""Greatest Hits"" aslo has 2 songs from ""Cheshire Cat"", 2 songs from ""Dude Ranch"", 3 songs from Enema of the State, 3 songs from ""Take Off Your Pants and Jacket"", and 4 from ""blink-182."" The ""bonus tracks"" are ""Not Now"" and ""Another Girl, Another Planet"" which was on the drummer's show ""Meet The Barkers."" That one is also the only song on this album not written by Blink. All-in-all, they did pretty well with putting their famous songs on one cd. I would suggest purchasing it."
4,"good, but could be better","has some of their better songs on it, most of blink's best. but is missing some amazing songs like Aliens Exist and Anthem Part 2 to name a few. regardless, a great album, better than most other albums that are out there. wprth buying."
1,"Hey people, this aint Punk","Why do so many claim Blink 182 to be musical Gods of Punk music? First off, if you want Punk Music/Hardcore (pretty much the same genere of the late 70's and 80's) then try on some Exploited, Sex Pistols, Clash, Bad Brains, Old Suicidal Tendincies, Circle Jerks, and Sick of it All. Since when is Punk supposed to be happy and upbeat? This is some of the worst music that I have ever heard. I mean its like it was written for Children..Lets all be happy..yea yea yea...La LA la...Come..ON..This is really bad pop music with a whinny lead singer, and a bunch of other horrible musicians...Want some Punk...Go check out the bands I just listed and you will be using you Blink CD's as Frisbees soon"
1,How could they do this?,"How could blink 182 put ""all the small things"" on their greatest hits? It was probably the worst song they've ever made and is only on their because of all the annoying screaming girls that loved it. That song turned blink into a pop band until they finally snapped out if it with take of your pants and their self titled cd. I am disappointed in blink for putting that song on there, therefore i am giving this cd a 1 star without even hearing it and i will not go buy this album because of it as well."
4,Previously unreleased-eh i dont think so,"First off Geffen Ireland/UK should be very careful what they put on stickers on this album-""contains 2 previously unreleased tracks"". this is simply not true as we have already heard ""not now"" on the untitled album.Aside from that I was desperately hoping for new versions of Carousel and M&Ms; which didnt happen however we did get much improved versions (preduction wise) of ""Dammit"" and ""Josie"".Of course its still a marvellous record from a uniquely gifted band but long standing fans may feel a bit miffed at the inclusion of ""not now"" and the original versions of the Cheshire Cat tracks.This band are gone for good, this is a fitting sign off. RIP Blink 182"
5,Blink best of,"I've liked Blink for years and this is a fun collection of some of their better songs. Hard-core fans of the early days might jeer at it, but no worries here. It's a fun album."
5,Love this CD,I absoultly LOVE this CD. I bought it July 31 and it just got delievered today. I just fell in love with the CD ever since :)
4,"A collection of hits, not their best songs.","This cd is good for what it tries to be...greatest hits. These are all of blinks classic songs that you have heard on the radio a number of times. Do not judge Blink by just these songs, they have so many other great ones. Blink is one of the most influential bands of our generation and will be missed.TO ALL THE TRUE PUNK ROCKERS(Cause your so hardcore!): Please, please stop complaining about what is punk rock. And stop using the Sex Pistols as an example. They are one of the most manufactured bands in music history. Do you not know that they were put together by a manager (Sounds familiar to many boy bands...and you call blink a boy band HA)? Do you not know that their name comes from a store their manager owned before he wanted to put together a ""punk"" band. Do you homework first!"
4,BLINK 182 Greatest hits,"This is Blink's first Greatest hits album. I love all of the songs on it, even though i think there should be more songs then just 15 original songs from their albums. They are missing a few songs but the album still is great. The mix of the songs are great and go well in order when playing everysong. Inside the album the booklet contains each of the lyrics of everysong in there. This CD also has a matching DVD that has 13 of their music videos. Blink 182 has been around for years and i hope they stay together and make awesome songs and hopefully in teh future..greatest hits 2"
5,Best Blink EVER!,"Great cd! Every song is a memorable punk gem. Dammit is the best song ever, same with The Rock Show, and All The Small Things. The only disappointment was they didn't put on Anthem Part 2, and Shut Up, and those songs rock. All in all, a great cd. Definetley worth the buy.P.S. (Why did they open with ""Carousel""?)"
1,why?,"how come everyone seems to think that blink 182's old stuff was all immature fart jokes etc. blink have always been serious-listen to songs like waggy and lemmings to find out. the fact that dude ranch, by far their best album, only has 2 songs on here is a travesty. carousel is the only cheshire cat song here as they have decided to leave out the other goods from that album. the majority of the comp is made up of the sh#t from the last album - over emotional drivvel with no focus (down-please step forward). i don't think there has ever been a bigger decline in musical quality than blink 182. i mean to go from dammit to down is inconceivable"
2,"instant high, hollow music","This is a CD to put on if you want a quick boost, like a chocolate bar. Suitable for all pop fans, please don't call it punk or rock as it is just infectious, catchy pop."
4,to all,"this band got me into music when i was just a lad. people have to stop saying ""blink isnt 'punk rock'"" yeah yeah, get over it.... i know they aren't punk and we ALL know they aren't punk. punk as some of of you know is screaming and playing as fast as you can. i like all that too so i'm not critizing that. punk may also be a band like The Clash or Fugazi which is the changing of rock n' roll into something more alternative. blink 182 is pop punk. this genre is really looked down upon by all the crap thats out there today but there are pop punk bands like Green Day and Alkaline Trio that are also some of my favorites. blink-182 was a band inspired by The Cure and The Desendents. therefore, they aren't true ""hardcore"" punk, the music gives you the chills and reminds you of when you were a kid, which is what i love. selection for this album could of been better though, which is why i give it a four. STOP GIVING REVEIWS THAT SAY THEY ARENT PUNK..... WE ALL KNOW!!"
1,stupid product!,"I wish I read the previous review before I purchased this router.Yes, this was a plug and play router. Just plug the broadband/cable connection and viola! Instant internet connection. No disconnects, no problems.Why stupid? Whenever I turn WEP on, the router becomes useless. How stupid is that? WEP (security: either 64 ot 128 bit) is important but USR failed on this issue.PURCHASE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!I trusted the US Robotics name because they made good modems. Now I know they are good only at modems. :("
1,Description of product sucks,This movie will not play in my dvd player or my blue ray. When purchasing this dvd it did not show the format or colour as being PAL.(European format) It will only play on my laptop.
5,Enjoyable Videos,"This story is about a very unlikely story. It is fun and seemingly impossible that a group of young men who have never even seen snow should enter the olympics to race, but this is Hollywood!"
5,A really cool picture,"I saw this movie like 4 times. It's a very enjoyable movie, with good actors -a fine John Candy, a good Leon and cast-, a good serius plot and great music. I recommend you to watch it!"
5,Funny and painful,"This is a movie we love to hate. It has lots of laughs, but there is a lot of pain as well. There are times I don't think I can bear to watch the ending, and yet the ultimate honor and triumph make is all worth while. Be sure to have a box of tissues handy. Is it? Yes, I think it is one of my all time favorites."
5,This movie has a great soundtrack,"This movie is loosely based on a true story of a Jamaican bobsled team. When the Olympic trials for sprinters become a disaster, a group of young men from Jamaica enter the 1988 Olympics as a bobsled team. John Candy is the coach who must redeem himself. While the world watches, the team and coach become the laughingstock of the Olympic Games. Then they become an inspiration. The movie has a great soundtrack."
3,Change region thing,I'm happy to have itI do not like changing the region to watchI would order another movie for the same price
1,I got ripped off,it did not work. it would not play in my dvd player or my blu ray player. any other disc I have bought or rented has worked in either player. I then returned the dvd and I have not received anything back. thanks for nothing...
5,true story,great story of the olympic team from jamaica john candy great as always great product fast delivery thx
3,Cool Runnings,I choose this rating because the movie is great but the movie came later than the date it was supposed to come.
4,Hilarious Winter Fun,"I absolutely love this movie. Its great fun for all ages. It combines a lot of humor with the age old tradition of the olympics, especially bobsledding... who would ever think Jamaica would have a bobsled team? This is one of my favorite movies and I'd suggest it to anyone."
2,A Crunchy Parental Review of,"This is the story of the Jamaican bobsled team that made it to the Olympics. It is based on a true story.Unfortunately, true or not, there are scenes you just don't want children to see, and we were prettty shocked that it was rated only PG.We could maybe have lived with one character calling another ""*ssh*le"", but there is an extended scene in a bar, involving a bar fight, during which the drinking, name-calling and fighting in that scene bracket another scene in the mens room of the bar, where one of the characters looks into a mirror and says, over and over, "" I'm a bad-*ss mother who don't take no cr*p off of nobody!""If these don't bother you - or if your child is of an age where you feel it's ok for them to see these scenes - then ""Cool Runnings"" is an otherwise ok movie. But these scenes were of a magnitude that for us this movie was definitely not ok.Anne[...]"
2,Unrealistic,The previews seem to indicate that this move is about a Jamaican bobsled team. Just seems a bit far fetched to me. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE ICE OR SNOW IN JAMAICA!
5,A Beautiful Watch,"A quick review is that this is a beautiful watch! I am not a diver, but love the style. I checked other sellers and Amazon beat all, as usual! Even though not at the sale price now, it is still a steal! David"
1,This gun sux,"Yeah i'm knew to airsoft and i'm the kinda guy who likes sniping. So when i saw this gun i was like, ""all right a kool sniper for a good price."" when i finally got it i was showin my friend and it shot out about 5 bb's and after that is just stopped. It was weird it wouldn't shoot when i held it regularly but when i held it upside down it would. i later found out that it was a problem with the clip. and i also found out the the auto winder i was given was junk too. i put the batteries in and it would just get stuck. so overall if u want to waste some money on a gun that will break instantly then by all means this gun is for you."
1,SUCKS,my friend bought this gun and was super excited when he got it. It sputered out one bb and then died. it hasnt worked since. do not buy
1,The World is too big!,"I read this book and determined that the world is entirely too big! Yeeesh! Also the book was way over priced. It has a lot of info, but often talks in a menagerie of metaphors!"
5,Expensive but well worth it,"I paid quite a bit for this textbook, but in my opinion it is well worth it. The book is highly detailed with lots of nice diagrams and maps. It was pretty easy to follow/understand, but contains so much information that you can be overwhelmed easily if you do not enjoy Cultural/World Geography."
5,Lotus in a Sea of Fire,"This is an excellent history of Vietnam which goes back to its origins and the start of the Missionaries from Portugal and France who went to Vietnam in 1533 and helped create a division in Vietnam which led to France, China, Japan and the US continuing to try and colonize and recolonize their country over the centuries. Its goes up to 1967 and a peace proposal by the author that was ignored by the US and its Ally and puppet, South Vietnam and also ignored by the North Vietnamese. We all need to learn from the author that the current 2 wars are in dire need of reconciliation and non-violence as the way. This should be required reading in all High Schools and Colleges."
5,sad History,"This is a story of the police chiefs taking over a nation. It is a story of a politic living in fear of itself. A battle of Camelot vs. Evil. Not in some third world country but our own United States. In the 1960's there was a battle for personal freedom and the right to privacy, a civil rights movement that was not defined by color but rather the essence of liberty. Here is a glimpse at that battle and one man who fought it. A sad history, still a great lesson for today and well worth the read!"
3,Smelly fan ;(,"Fan was beauiful & material was used seems study & solid, however the paint used or something about the fan itself smells horrible. I aired it out for two days outside which helped but if you get close next to the fan you can still smell it the odor..Any tips on how to get the smell removed?"
5,After reading dozens of books on martial arts this is.....,"the absolute best! Put very simply, if you have studied internal kung fu, or any style of kung fu for that matter, and want to get REALLY good, study this book and then apply it! All aspects of your training will be greatly enhanced."
5,Great Book,The Park Bok Nam book on the fundametals of bagua chang is the best book I have seen to date on the subject. I also have the companion videos and the combination of the books and videos is a fantastic instructional tool.
5,A necessary book for the practice of internal arts!!,"I've just started pa kua practice and bought this book in order to use it as a reference, but it became more than that! The examples are relatively easy to follow and the theory behind the art of pa kua is also explained very well. I never really understood the theories of ""sung"" or the ""kung fu body"" until I read this book. The examples in this book must be practiced, however, or else it will be of no use."
5,For Those Interested in the Martial Aspects -- Definitely the best book on Amazon,"I've read just about every book on Amazon relating to Bagua.This book literally has been *The Best* in terms of martial coverage and overall understanding. It is very obvious that Lu Shui Tien and Park Bok Nam really truly have an excellent understanding of the internal arts.I've found the footwork chapter to be the most interesting and most useful. It seems that many bagua books (and even teachers..) assume that just by walking the circle you'll gain an understanding of all the evasive footwork inherent in real combat. WRONG! This book really gives you the details to gain a better understanding of applicable footwork, beyond simply walking left or right of the opponent.Literally, my most prized book on Bagua. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants an excellent understanding of real bagua, a complete system."
5,Guitar Hero 1 Rocks!,This is awesome! My daughter got it for Christmas and I'm not sure who has more fun...her or her dad. It is very interative and gives plenty of entertainment to both of them. I think what I like best is that she has a game that she can enjoy with her dad. So they get the quality time together playing. My [...] year old son hasn't tried it yet but I think he would be a little young for it but he sure does enjoy watching and so do I. We have had family over for Guitar Hero parties too. All the kids and adults love it.
4,disappointed!,I did not recieve it ! It was canceled. Luckily i was able to buy it from some other source:) I'm Enjoying it !!!!
5,Guitar Hero Bundle,The Game is tons of fun. Everything is easy to hook up. It was packaged nicely. Will definately buy again.
5,Fun Solo but Better With Someone Else (like other things),I ordered Guitar Hero after reading the amazon reviews of it being one of the best games out there. This was very true and I had a great time rocking out. The only problem is that your fingers get really tired after a while. This is why it's so much better to switch off with a buddy every other song. M girlfriend just gave a stare and a head shake when i asked her but my buddy Ryan was up to the task. A couple of beers and a little Guitar Hero makes for a fun night.
5,PS2 Guitar Hero I -- great game!,"This is a great game. My son and I played it in the store a month or so before Christmas and I was so happy that he put it on his wish list so that I would be able to play too! So he got it for Christmas and it was a hit with everyone. I think some of the songs are pretty difficult, but then I haven't played it very much. With 3 levels, there's a lot of room to improve your skills, and still be challenged. And then, there's Guitar Hero II! Definitely recommend!"
5,The Sweetest Game Ever For Any System,"This is by far the sweetest game ever. It is simply amazing how much fun can be had with this game. The fact that you have a guitar to play along with your favorite rock songs is unreal.The controller is awsome, and i love the strum bar how it acts just like strings on a real guitar.The whammy bar adds a whole other level of fun as well."
5,She loves it,"My 16-year old daughter thinks this game is the best game she has ever played. She plays it constantly, both by herself and with friends."
5,This video gets your heart going!,"If you like to dance and shake your thing. You will love this video. You do not need a lot of space either. This video works more than just your core. There is squatting throughout to work your upper legs and glutes! I have done the video three times now and I can't wait until my next work out. I don't see myself getting bored any time soon! The moves are sexy too! You can take some of the moves to the club!Nicole SmithCincinnati, Ohio"
1,LIST THE CONTENTS OF THE MERCHANDISE - is that too much to ask?,"Why can't sellers tell me what all comes with the merchandise sets they want to sell me?List the DVDs in the merchandise and pull the descriptions on the individual DVDs so I know what is being sold. Here's a news flash - they can have from 1 to as many as 7 DVDs each and there's no standardized contents for the sets. Not as far as I can see anyway. Core Rhythms doesn't seem to have a list of the products that I can consult.I would really like to buy some of these products but I don't want to purchase duplicate DVDs.Please, list the contents of the sets and what each DVD does."
1,Do Not Buy These Videos!,"I thought the intro package was great, but it went downhill from there. The intro package has a long and short workout. The rest of the videos have only the long workout. In total I have 5 of these videos. They do mix it up with some dance moves, but many, many of the the moves are march-in-place- repetitive. DanceSport LLC customer service is TERRIBLE! It took them 3 tries to get my address corrected. I sent back a duplicate product but they never did give me credit for it. Kept me on hold for up to 30 minutes at a time too when I had to call; and I had to call at least 8 times! BUY USED only!"
5,990 Serries,"The 990 Serries New Balance are some of the best shoes availible. After standing on concrete floor for 8 to 10 hours per day, I found other brands looked great, but were uncomfortable after 3 or 4 months. The New Balance shoes lasted twice as long and cost about the same price as the Nike and other brands I had previously purchased. I've bought nothing but New Balance ever since - for over 10 years now. Beside the durablity and the correct size avalibility, I find wearing shoes made in the USA rather than Korea or China a major plus!"
2,well meaning film falls flat,"**1/2Written and directed by E. Paul Edwards, ""Fighting Words"" is a low-budget romantic drama set in the fringe world of slam poetry. Jake Thompson (Jeff Stearns) is the pained poet and Marni Elliot (Tara T`Agostino) the HIV-positive book publisher who takes an interest in the promising young man's person and work. C. Thomas Howell appears as a slime ball, cutthroat poet (and ex-boy friend of Marni) who will stop at nothing to keep Jake from winning a competition and the book deal that goes with it. Fred Willard puts in an appearance near the end as the emcee of the contest.The movie is certainly well-intentioned, and it earns at least a few points for its unusual subject matter, but an overall amateurishness in the performances and direction relegates it to minor league status. Moreover, an air of contrivance in the storytelling - especially in the final third - goes a long way towards undercutting any credibility the film might have had."
5,Still possible to be surprised,"30 years I listen to music (and although french, mostly anglo-american one), had often the feeling I would not be surprised again, excited again, and this kind of record comes out to remove this senile thought. Mixing so much influences (Jane's addiction, Stooges, Only Ones, Spacemen 3, Primal Scream, Led Zeppelin, Craw, Jesus Lizard) and being still innovative is quite impressive. Listen to this CD several times a day. A thing I rarely did in my life. Easily the best condidate for CD of the year."
1,buddyhead loves them,that's because one of the guys that runs buddyhead is in this joke of a band. anti-pop music that's doing the same thing as the music it's against. trying to sound like bands from 20 years ago that they couldn't touch in their dreams(this time it's jesus lizard and the stooges.) the only idiots who partake in this trash are hip scenesters who think they're incredibly deep for liking this unoriginal pile of horse manure.just stick to jesus lizard and the stooges.
4,Very cool,"I gotta both agree and disagree with the previous review. The Icarus line do take alot of influences and ""cut and paste"" them into their music but unlike maybe older listners I really don't have the time to be going through 100s of old Iggy Pop albums to find these similarities. Bands like the Icarus line have to be given due credit as they're the ones that carry this music foward. I mean dude I can't exactly travel into the past to an Iggy concert, but I can see bands like the Icarus Line when they tour and maybe experience some of that energy."
1,This band is as close to garbage as actual garbage,"I saw this band a couple of years ago open for the yeah yeah yeah's and I don't think I have ever been privy to a bigger on stage disaster than what I saw there. This band reeks something awful. Maybe they have gotten it together since then, but I doubt it. Nothing constuctive could possibly come out of the ear explosion that is the Icarus Line. It just goes to show though, teenagers looking to rebel will find anything as there muse as long as other people hate it."
2,All you have to do is not pull the cord.,"People have tried to explain to me how good this movie is, but to me it is a rather poor film. Charlie Sheen is okay. But most of the film just seemed to be lacking in many ways. The plot is not particuly clever but then not many action films are. But at the end of it I just felt it was lacking, that there was something major missing from the film. My pick for the skydiving action film would have to go to drop zone. I'd rent this one before thinking of buying."
1,Oh - My - Gosh!!!,Did the other reviewers watch the same movie I just watched??? This movie is so incredibly bad!!! Please tell me it's supposed to be a comedy. I laughed all the way through because it was so ridiculous.
3,good movie,plenty of action It is a little to adult to watch with the kids thoughI saw it before so that might have it worst for me
3,"Great Action, Sub Par Plot= Really Enjoyable B Movie","Ok, where to begin. This film is like a mix of James Bond, Mission Impossible, Eraser, and maybe a parody film. I only say this because many of the moments in the film are acted or scripted quite comedically. As far as the overall enjoyability goes, it was a very pleasant action film, filled with action comedy, and thrills."
3,pretty good,"This is a so so thriller, that does keep your attention, and Nasstasja Kinski is always watchable. Charlie Sheen has presence, but appears burnt out, as is standard for his performances. If you want decent action, that won't leave much of a memory in your mind after you've seen it (which isn't that big a put-down in my mind) check this out."
4,Exciting and enjoyable.,"Terminal Velocity is a highly watchable action adventure,that goes by at a steady pace,has some enjoyable action sequences and has some enjoyable wry humour here and there."
5,wallet,"excellent workmanship, as good as vb.a tad smaller than vb, this is a true wallet.it does not have the room to carry a small cell phone..which i can do with my vb wallet on a string..i wish it did have that little strap, i would use it more often.but you can't beat it for the price."
5,Uplifting Worship with Great Verses!,"This is an excellent cd! The verses speak so much to my soul, and the music complements them very well!It is truly strengthening!"
2,Look Around,"The covers on the seats look good and are adequate. They covered the seat wear and look good. The headreast covers were too small. The solid colored covers for the console and seat, under the console, look ""cheap"" and I opted not to use them. The stitching on the tightner on the passenger seat came unstitched during application. Overall these seat covers were a disappointment. The saying you get what you pay for certainly applies to this purchase."
5,wish I knew I needed 2,"I bought the cable for my digital keyboard, thinking it was all I needed. Come to find out, I should have ordered 2, 1 in-1 out. Hopefully, this will solve the problem. Great Service!"
5,Hilarious movie,I have watched this movie over and over and laugh so hard every time I watch it! It is so much fun!!
5,this is not at all a chick flick!!1,"This is one of the funniest movies of all time,for me it deffinatly was.Me and most all my male friends found this hilarious also, watch it and see"
5,The best!,"This is the best girl movie there is, but still, guys should like it too... The story is about two girls named Romy and Michele. Romy works at a car dealer and Michele is um... unemployed. When a former classmate of Romy comes in the car dealer, she first hears about her first annual High School reunion. It seems okay now, but then they decide that their lives aren't very interesting, they decide to look for boy friends and better jobs. This is the most hilarious movie I've seen for a while, with a great cast of characters with original personalities it really adds to the fun. If you can get your hands on it, don't miss the chance of buying it, your money will not be wasted."
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life, and I am not the harshest critic of movies by any means. This movie is not funny at all, the acting is terrible, and plot is cliqued and outdated. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! THE MOVIE IS HORRIBLE!"
1,no,Don't see this movie. It's a waste of time and energy. It's just about 2 nit wits wanting to impress everyone at their high school reunion.
5,Romy and Michele's High School Reunion,Funny movie especially if you remember the 80's and your 10 year reunion. Which I choose to forget!! Chick flick.
4,funny movie,"two best friends have been together since high school and decide to attend their high school reunion but they felt like outcasts and wanted to be impressive to their peers, only to find out the hard way that they were already fine the way they were with all their funky fashion outfits they wore, which were much more entertaining than the boring clothes the others wore in a hick town state. I loved all the 80's music tributes in the movie and the madonna outfits romy and michelle wore in their high school days. And let's not forget time after time hahahaha"
5,TOTAL FAVORITE!!!,THIS MOVIE IS HANDS DOWN AN INSTANT FAVORITE.. THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN ROMY AND MICHELE IS SO FUNNY!!! A MUST HAVE!!!
4,I wish..........,"Having been considered a nobody at high school, (if I was actually considered at all), this movie represents my ultimate fantasy - to be a roaring success at a high school reunion! I don't know why people are saying that Jennifer Aniston is the only successful film 'Friend' because I haven't seen Lisa Kudrow put in a bad performance yet! Making millions of dollars isn't the only indicator of a great film, you know! For all you fellow ex-high school nerds out there, this movie is a must see. It will give you many hints on what to do and not do should you feel the need to relive past suffering and attend a high school reunion, whilst providing many belly-laughs along the way."
3,A cute funny movie,"So at first they seem annoying but in fact, they are cute as buttons, as is the story...and some of the lines are unavoidingly funny. And the music, well, old school, perky, and funny, and it made me smile.Silly, yes, bad no. Worth seeing."
3,Eh,"It was okay, but I seemed to like it when I watched it the first time when it came out than the second time around."
4,"Funny movie if you don't like, overthink it. Good portrayal of a High school reunion","I finally rented this one as a free rental to see what some of my collegues were laughing about, and it wasn't that bad. Althought parts were far fetched like landing a helicopter at the reunion, the movie itself is a funny reflection on High School and the Clicks that would develop...and Its a Movie, its meant to be over the top. At least Romy and Michelle were Happy through school and life, although clueless, and thats what matters. Worth watching at least once, but one I could see on the shelf of many homes."
4,RE-WATCH-ABILITY....You won't get tired of it..DAMN FUNNY!!!,"Let's face it....if you like Lisa Kudrow, you'll love this movie...if you don't...then forget it. Rent it, first, if you are worried about liking it...but, I guarantee you'll want to see it more than once. Listening to Lisa Kudrow's (Michele) rendition of the lyrics to ""Footloose"" is nearly worth it alone."
2,"OK, You Can Stop Kidding Now","Many people are incredibly fond of this picture, and not just on Amazon. I don't get it. I can't even say that it's Sorvino or Kudrow's fault- they're both engaging, and there are other pictures they've been in which attest to their comic abilities, but they have an uphill struggle against this script.Even with a mostly coherent story,**Romy and Michelle** feels like a series of tv show sketches strung together, because most of its humor depends on people being two-dimensional stereotypes and behaving according to the dictates of gag writers rather than being wholly realized(or even semi-realized) characters.I wonder if many people like this movie because they WANT to like it so hard, much like the fable of the emperor without clothes, which makes one of the many implausible gags kind of appropriate, come to think of it.I liked Parker Posey in **Party Girl**, like, ten thousand times better."
1,Bad DVD,I was really excited to get this DVD in the mail as it is one of my favorite movies of all time. I immediately noticed it was rattling around in the case and when i opened it one of the middle tabs that holds the DVD into place was broken off the the DVD was just moving around so I was not happy about that but then when I put the DVD in to watch it I was even more dissapointed. The quality of the DVD is horrible it looks like someone recorded an old VHS version themselves in zoom mode. Half of the time I couldnt see all of their faces no matter what setting I would switch my tv to. I dont know if it is just because I picked the $10 movie and maybe I should of payed up for the more expensive one? Either way it was a bad purchase.
2,Stupid waste of time,"The characteres in this film are stupid, the plot of the and plot is stupid beyond beleive. Why was this film made? How could these other reviewers possibly like it. My family is probably the only people who didn't like it. Even Roger Ebert liked it! Come on! What is wrong these people?!!!! The story is about these two stupin bimbos who have no live going to there highschool reunion. They borrow a nice car, get some nice cloths, and act like there very sucessful. This movie is such a waste of film and time with bareley any comedy thats funny in it. Don't listen to the other people. The fact these almost everyone liked it is not a good sign. THIS MOVIE IS TOTALLY STUPID!!!"
1,Horrible!,I bought this n was so excited to watch it! When I put it in my DVD player it wouldnt work I looked n it was all in French!!!! Do not buy
1,"Tedious, flat, and predictable","I recollect reading, when this movie came out, that it was based on a stand-up comedy skit about 9 minutes long. At that length, it probably worked. But expanded to 90 minutes or so, it simply doesn't. Yeah, I know it's supposed to be satire of sorts, but it's not funny. Both of the main characters are dense beyond belief, and all the people at their reunion are stereotypes. The movie is so desperate to fill time that it has R&M go through the reunion TWICE, and it's not funny either time! You do get to see Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino in their bras and panties, but that's not enough to make this turkey worth watching, let alone buying."
4,FUNNY!!!!,The movie centers around two California girls(played by Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow)who are going to attend there High School Reunion. Problem is they were total geeks in High School. So they decide to impress there former classmates by pretending they're famous inventors. Then someone blows there cover and both are totally humiliated. Then they find that they don't need to impress everyone to be cool because they are cool. It's a great movie but not my favorite. It's rated R because they swear in nearly every scene. Enjoy!
4,"so stupid, it's hilarious...","This movie makes no pretense- it's an unrealistic movie about two high school losers, ten years later. Everything about the story is overexaggerated, from the airheaded dialog to the bitter, chain smoking feminazi...BUT, for those who like the utterly ridiculous, this movie is surprisingly funny. This movie is great entertainment for those of us who were glad not to be part of the 90210 set way back when. These bimbos may not have class, but they sure have style!"
4,the perfect menage a trois,"I enjoy a good Kafka novel. This is better, because it is fun, Kearkagard, Sartre, Hess, at the same time."
3,Ok movie but.....,I don't really remember people being cruel to other people (like some were to Romy & Michele) when I was a sr. in h.s. They were just cliquey!
3,It needed more H.S. stereotypes,"It was cute and fun, but lost all credibility when Lisa Kudrow claimed she was Mary and Mira Sorvino was Rhoda. Lisa's best line: ""College -- good one!"""
4,A classic thriller,"Pales by today's standards in terms of graphics, violence, etc...but still a good movie. As usual, Patty Duke gives a wonderful performance...And Richard Thomas is no ""John Boy""!"
4,Style secrects,"This product brought back some interesting memories, I owned it when it was first published,and am glad to have another copy. the condition is less than perfect but as its 30yrs old that is to be expected."
4,NOW THIS IS QUITE A THRILLER!,"The story and the thriller go so well together. DeMornay's appearance is real solid, especially when she plays the stalker. I liked the whole thing!"
4,WOW - quite horrific!,"Rebecca DeMorney was amazing. The chararcter was rather evil. My favourite scene is when she is getting the greenhouse ""ready"". The only un-realistic thing in the movie is when Annabella Sciorra (aka Claire Bartel) takes her inhaler - she doesn't put it in her mouth to take it. Other than this I think that the movie is well worth seeing again!!"
5,Chlling Thriller. Tense From Start To Hair-Raising Finish. Rebecca DeMornay Is Excellent.,"Rebecca DeMornay, Annabella Sciorra, Ernie Hudson & Julianne Moore star in this intense drama. Rebecca DeMornay is simply superb. Annabella Sciorra, Ernie Hudson, Julianne Moore and the rest of the cast play their roles finely, but Ms. DeMornay stands out above the rest. Like Bette Davis, she commands every scene she is in, sometimes without saying a word. I highly recommend this tense thriller. The movie should have been rated PG-13."
3,NOT BAD THRILLER! LOOKS LIKE A TV MOVIE!,"This movie always reminded me of one of those life channel TV movies. It is however, well constructed and there are some good performances, especially De Mornay as the psycho nanny from H E L L ! It's kind of predictable, but I thought it did keep my interest. The DVD transfer looks good."
3,The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,I remember watching this film when it was at the theaters butafter seeing it again many years later I am not as impressedwith it as when I was young and not so savvy.The Hand ThatRocks the Cradle was very predictable and the acting was notworthy of ever watching it again.I gave it to my mom!!
5,They're my family now,"Now this is one of my favorite movies. If you learn nothing in life, remember to never hire a hot nanny and always do a background check when it comes to your kids. The Best Movie Ever!!1"
5,Huge fan of Rebecca DeMornay,"I am so fond of Rebecca! I have collected all of her movies and it seems that Rebecca plays all the movies that she is a ""evil"" inside her body just like this movie. I first heard about Rebecca was when I first watched this movie and I asked my parents ""Who was this woman?"" and they answered ""Rebecca DeMornay"" and I collected all of her movies she played in. I was about 12 years old when I first watched this movie with parents. I am now 27 years old and I still love her to death!! Rebecca was / is a GREAT actress!! 5 stars!!"
2,Tedious,"It's hard to believe the director of this faltering addition to Hollywood's yuppies-in-peril cycle of the early 1990s went on to make such outstanding films as ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Wonder Boys."" To be fair, the fault lies mainly with the screenplay - a textbook working of an elaborate revenge plot which tries to exploit a whole range of middle-class anxieties: molesting doctors, black burglars, lurking pedophiles, old friends who want to steal your husband and, of course, nannies who want to take over your life. The plot is predictable and the ending deplorably contrived. Ultimately, though, it's Rebecca De Mornay who makes this thing endurable. She's so chillingly good as the vengeful Peyton that you're cheering when Annabella Sciorra finally gets to punch her in the face. Other performances are merely adequate, with the notable exception of Julianne Moore: she steals the few scenes she's given and shows why she, like director Hanson, has gone on to much bigger and better things."
5,Hottest movie of the millennium!,"I saw this first time when I was 8 years old. I watched this with my sister and I loved this film. This came from TV when I was 10 and I taped it. I'm watching this almost everyday because I love this movie! It's thrilling, hot and I like Rebecca De Mornay.My favorite character is Peyton, of course. I like evil characters and she is one of the kind! Always when she did something bad I was excited. What if someone sees her?I love this movie and you have to watch it too!"
4,Predictable but scary,"Yes, scary because it is scary to find out that the people whom you trust turn out to be someone you shouldn't. It's predictable because at the very start, we all know that Rebecca DeMornay is the wife of the doctor who sexually harrassed his patients & later on committed suicide upon losing face. We all know that she seeked employment in that particular household to aenge her husband's death, her loss & all other pain both real & imagined caused by her psychological breakdown. What keeps the viewers glued to the set is the exceptional performance of Rebecca -- what would she do next to the hapless unsuspecting victims. I got acquainted with her through this film & up to these days, I still remember her because of her excellent performance in this film."
4,A Genuine Thriller!,"In this very entertaining thriller, Rebecca De Mornay plays a woman who seeks revenge on Annabella Sciorra and her family. Why? Because Annabella filed sexual harassment on Rebecca's husband, who then killed himself; so as Rebecca says: ""What goes around comes around!"" This film works mainly because of Rebecca De Mornay. She really makes the audience nervous! Amazingly well-done flick is a must! Great on every level!"
5,Good movie!,I always loved this movie & was so excited to find it on amazon. The movie looks great & is as good as I remembered.
4,Rebecca can babysit me anytime,"This is a great film. Direction, cinematography, editing, and acting are all terrific. I just love how evil De Mornay is here. The eyes, the body - so alluring. Not having seen this in some time, I'd forgotten that a young Julianne Moore was in it too. This is a film that needs a special edition; so come on let's have it!"
3,Rocking the cradle,"Standard by the book thriller sees Rebecca DeMornay as a nanny out to seek revenge on an unsuspecting couple who brought about the downfall of her marriage and her unborn child. When Anabella Sciorra lays a charge of sexual abuse against her gynecologist, he promtly ends his life leaving his wife (DeMornay) with mounting debts and her own baby soon on the way. When an unexpected miscarriage occurs DeMornay becomes hellbent on taking away the perfect existence of her husbands accuser, who she firmly believes destroyed hers. DeMornay is shockingly good matched against Sciorra's wholesome picture perfect surburban mom. Direction and editing is tight but it all acumulates into typical Hollywood slasher antics."
3,A good story .,"Rebecca DeMornay plays a 'perfect' for busy Claire, but everybody is yet to know that DeMornay's character is actually husband of a doctor, who milesterd Claire. Now DeMornay wants revenge and she is gonna get it. This movie was alright but some of it was so awful, Rebecca DeMornay's character is definitely one of the biggest in movie history!"
5,Loved the tips and information,"Within the first week of owning this book the Good Puppy with Bad Habits had chewed the spine of the book. So now my book has real character. Oh and the guilty party in question got crate trained and now she is no longer eating books, shoe molding, window ledges or shoes. I think she had some separation anxiety issues."
3,Tom Buchanan investigates the disapperance of his freighting business partner.,"Rig Bogan served a two year term at Huntsville penitentiary for stabbing Sam Stell to death when Stell discovered Bogan sleeping with Stell's prostitute wife Ruth. Bogan's father gave Tom Buchanan $1000 to get his son's life back on track through honest employment.Buchanan and Rig used the money in San Antone to set up a freighting business. When Rig didn't return when expected after taking a $10,000 load of cotton to Matamoros, Buchanan left San Antone to investigate. This brought him up against the notorious killer Big Red Leech and his men who were helping businessmen from Brownsville run contraband into Mexico.This is the Buchanan character that Randolph Scott portrayed in the 1958 Budd Boetticher movie: `Buchanan Rides Alone'. The movie was based on Jonas Ward's `The Name's Buchanan', another of the 80-odd books in the Buchanan series."
4,Loving the bike!,"I received the bike about two months ago and I can say I'm loving it. Though, the flaws lie in two things: the shipping and the gears.When I took it out of the package I noticed one thing, the rear wheel was warped ever so slightly. Now, just a slight warping can screw up the brakes, but I managed to adjust them fine. So problem solved there.I haven't been able to ride it as often as I'd like, but it's still smooth. I'd have to disagree with the guy that said you shouldn't ride it on trails as that's all I've been doing. I have a problem with the gears. I love the gear shifing system, easy to use. But the one thing that's upsetting me is the slippage on 1-7high on 1low. I may need to oil it a bit, so it may just be my fault.I'm glad with the purchase and my grandpa's glad to know I've got a Schwinn too."
4,"A dandy little ""Groo"" tale...","Sergio Aragones' ""Groo"" is one of the funniest comics of all time. The story of a dim-witted wanderer who causes destruction wherever he goes, this long-running series has worked in social commentary with wickedly funny tales for nearly 20 years now.In this old graphic novel from the title's days at Marvel Comics, Groo wanders into a town where the king wants him dead for costing them a war some time ago. When a series of mishaps causes the townspeople to believe Groo has perished, a celebration erupts. But Groo is alive, and heartbroken to discover how hated he is by the town. So he has to find a way to make himself a hero again.Funny, clever and beautifully drawn, Aragones and his partner Mark Evanier did a great job with this excellent graphic novel. More ""Groo,"" guys!"
5,lovely collection,Lesley Anne Ivory's intricate paintings delicately capture the refined yet playful spirit of the cat. She has chosen the perfect poems and prose -- which elegantly describe the cat's nature -- to go along with her works; most of the literary pieces will be new to the reader and thus provide a delightful surprise alongside Ivory's exquisite art. This is an excellent little book for cat lovers. It's pocket size also makes it great for on-the-go inspiration.
5,"FANTASTIC! This really works, read below!","Ok people let me give you the facts. I have tried all sorts of similar products that really just dont work. They dont blend well and get easily remove with sweat or any sort of liquid, NOT THIS PRODUCT!! This is fantastic, it really coats your hair making it look MUCH thicker and fuller. I instantly noticed a difference and feel much more confident out in public when using this item. Going swimming? NOT A PROBLEM! The only way this comes off is if you shampoo your hair. This is THE easy solution to help cover up thin spots in your hair. TRUST ME . You will love this product as much as I have. I consider myself a life long user from this point on.Thank you so much for this product."
4,Seems pretty good but overpriced !,"This product is my new ultimate solution for my receding hairline... It does the job pretty well better than most products out there.. However, the price on it is so expensive and I think is much exaggerated! This should have been around 20 to 25 dollars maximum and not 47 dollars ! It is definitely overpriced!"
4,Couldn't live without it!,I have been going crazy to try and figure out what is causing my female hair shed and hair loss. Unfortunately I have not yet figured it out but this product has saved my sanity for now. At least I have something to cover it up. Although if I do scratch my head I get black fingers nails. I will take the black finger tips over the scalp showing.
2,"wrong color, not black, what do i do now?",i got dark brown instead of the black i asked for (and mentioned in this listing) - i opened the product and chucked the packaging before noticing this error. anything i can do about it now or have i lost $50??
2,sudden price increase,Ok although I have been using this for the past 4 years and it does seal your hair and make it looks fuller. But with the sudden increase in price (over 100%) I am considering to switch to another product. Also I do not like how it kinda stains your sink and bathtub when you wash it off and it makes anyone who touches your hair instantly dirty.The saddest part is you can't rest your head on any surface or it would get it dirty.
1,Don't DO IT!,"My son got these as a birthday gift. Unfortunately we had to return it b/c all we heard was static. So, being the good person I am, I did an replacement option. Bad idea. The second pair didn't work either!So, this time, I got a refund.I will say that Amazon was very nice about the whole situation and I didn't have any problems with them....just the product."
4,great addition to my library,"as an advanced dancer, I really like the movement catalog and easy to follow along practice format. Lots of unique ideas for decorative foot & legwork that beautifully accents traditional bellydance technique."
3,Good enough,I got this for my 4G nano (2nd generation) so the fit is very snug but it does the job - protects my ipod and I can clip it on to my waist band when I workout. I prefer that than an arm band. It is sometimes hard to turn off the ipod through the clear plastic that covers the ipod face. It takes a couple of attempts or even having to take off the case but for the price it is worth it.
5,Honesty IS the best policy,"Intellgent, articulate and scathingly honest, this book is a slice of reality that shows the Sex Worker industry in a new light. Sarah Katherine's views on all the aspects of the work, from the highs to the lows, is refreshing and sometimes a little shocking. I was forced, during my reading, to feel a little uncomfortable at times because of how her words pierce the veil behind some of the darker aspects of her customers and how they can treat people. I've heard contra opinions and views, but I was happy to hear such an honest, unvarnished view of people and their needs. This book is a great read, although, like many, I'd like to hear more about the author's personal life, but the view we are given is fascinating and complex. Read this, and know a larger view of a seldom-seen world."
3,Mixed Bag,The good part of this memoir is the insights toward her work and the various and interesting co-workers she encounters along the way. Also a highlight is her unquestioned intelligence. The negative parts of this book is her unabashed hatred of men and all their effluvia. With her smarts she could easily find a field where her intelligence and ability to read and understand people would be of benefit. I recommend the law.
5,I am finally sated!,"After waiting and waiting I was overjoyed to see the ubiquitous brown Amazon box hit my doorstep! I've been reading Sarah-Katherine's livejournal for years, and to see this book come to fruition I felt strangely proud and so, so excited.It's all real and it's all there. It is thoroughly entertaining and unabashedly honest......there's no sugar coating and this isn't a romanticized account of the sex trade. Everything is vivid and coarse, beautiful and horrifying at the same time. This is truly a job, but she approaches it almost as an undercover reporter, making her almost the Donnie Brasco of stripping, peepshows, etc.The characters and places are all lovingly described, even the ones that the author doesn't love. This book makes you a VIP to what is really happening behind the velvet curtains and plexiglass windows."
3,Faking It,"Sarah Katherine Lewis is a very talented writer who sometimes loses her battle with heroin addiction, as she has chronicled publically on Live Journal. That's the aspect that makes her seem slippery, and addiction is well known to keep you working at a career you need to be high to perform. It's one of the most notorious and famous things about it. 12 step meetings are full of sex workers and bar tenders who after a certain point are told that if they want to get clean and sober they're going to have to find another profession. Most don't want to give it up for the power and attention it gives them. And the very good reasons it gives them to use.SK is much better and more talented than she knows. I hope she gets better."
3,Not my cup of tea,"A far better book is ""The Call Girl Actress, Confessions of a Lesbian Escort"" by Erica Black. This way too much of a downer for me, whereas the other was really fascinating."
5,"Engaging, honest, and just a fun read.","It may be strange to call this book fun, but aren't we all fascinated in the behind-the-scenes of the adult industry? This book tells one woman's experience in a straightforward and unapologetic way. From the peep show to the ""release massage"" we get to peek into a forbidden world from the sex worker's point of view.Lewis doesn't spend a lot of time boo-hooing about her past or circumstances that brought her to adult work. Instead, she expresses a true curiosity that let to a career that, while it has its definite downsides, is a career that gave her freedom and allowed her to be true to herself.I want to know what happened next!"
5,An interesting look inside an adult industry worker's mind,"I enjoyed this book quite a bit. While there are many unanswered questions (aren't there always in biographical books?) this book does a remarkable job of laying it on the line and being a good story. No fancy whistles or hidden morality lessons (except for don't be a pig if you're going to see a working girl), just an entertaining and almost voyeuristic read."
1,Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire,"Medicre book, but service and delivery of the book were superb."
3,Tastes like death,This stuff tastes like pure death and probably one of the worst tastes you will ever experience. That said I found a good way to make it bearable. Lemon juice concentrate takes the bite out. The key is to add enough. Adding a decent amount will turn it into a yellow gatorade color but you have to go past that keep adding enough until the water looks like a natural lemonade / soapy water color. Then you are at point where it doesn't taste great but definitely drinkable.Rating this 3 stars because the money you save buying this in powder form you pretty much pay for in calories or money making it drinkable. I havent tried vinegar yet but if that works than that might make it cheap enough to be somewhat worthwile.I would stick to capsules next time instead.
5,Excellent product.,"I like being able to use exactly what I want--no fillers, no preservatives, no capsules. Just l-arginine in powder form. I mix it into my morning protein shake. This large size container makes it quite affordable."
3,Still Waiting,"I've been taking this for a few weeks having one dose in the morning and one before bed, but Im still waiting to see any noticeable benefits or changes. The good thing is that I dont see any negative effects so Ill keep at it for now. Regarding the taste, HOLY CRAP! it tastes awful (smells awful too), but Ive found that mixing it with a little orange juice sort of masks the taste. I read some reviews about people taking it with just water, I did that once , but never again, those people are Champs."
5,Bang for the buck!,"I was a little sceptic of this stuff because of how good the price was but man, better pumps at the gym when I mix it with my cellacor C4. I will buy again."
3,NOW brand L-Arginine 2.2K power review,"As a regular user of L-Arginine power, 3 to 4 grams per day.Con: This brand tastes awful, of course all brands taste bad, but this one is the worse so far. I mix each 2 gram portion with full glass of OJ.Pro: This brand is less glumpy, by that I mean doesn't clot up like the other brands. Also the price is economical.If you don't mind the taste or after taste, go ahead and use this brand.Best regards,Doug"
3,Tastes Like Pure Evil...,"UPDATED: October 22nd, 2012I'll keep this short & sweet: Aside from the great price per pound of pure 5 grams of L-ARGININE, this tastes like PURE SATANIC EVIL.The powder itself is pretty odorless, but:1) When mixed with water only, tastes like sewer/toilet/poop water.2) When mixed with milk or protein shake, the taste is still there, it will ruin ur shake...3) When mixed with orange juice, the aweful taste is 75% gone, but the OJ gets too creamy.4) When mixed with Lemonade, the taste is about 90% gone, but way too sweet if you get it the pre mixed kinda like Turkey Hill..THE BEST WAY TO GET RID OF 99% OF BAD TASTE IS THIS:Mix it with a low calorie (5 cal) lemonade powder mix like crystal lite or other low cal mix... Lemonade flavor is the best...it somehow neautralizes the HORRIBLE FLAVOR.BOTTOM LINE, will I buy it again? YES, until they comeout with a cheaper good flavor ARGININE, this is it...UPDATED: October 22nd, 2012"
4,Tastes like...,swallowing a spit-up burp.Won't kill me but it is not the highlight of my day. I wake up to 40 grams of L-Arg and creatine mixed with some Mio squirt-flavor and eggs. I do notice a better pump. I try to get some down at night before bed but am just not motivated enough. Will probably go back to tablets when this runs out. I'm doing bcaa powder as well. Much easier to handle.
2,smells like nut,"i love NOW brand but cmon people just get some BCAA if you want aminos. arginine does jack for a pump. NO supplements don't work, they havent been proven to even.it smells like a load and its pretty hard to take with water."
2,Good value but the smell/taste is out of this world awful.,It smells like semen. Tastes like dirty bath water. I've tried everything mentioned here to mix with it. Best thing i've found is Orange Juice and just shoot it down and chase it. DO NOT SMELL IT BEFORE TAKING IT. Seriously. I'm not joking. Smells terrible. Overpowers my protien shakes when I tried to mix it with it. I love the value here but when i'm done with it (I refuse to waste it) i'll probably pay more to get a flavored L-Arginine
4,Great product with a horrible taste!,"This stuff taste like ****, no matter what you dilute it with. The aftertaste you get right after taken it is indescribable. I found a way to eliminate the flavor that works for me. I mix the powder with about 8 ounces (your choice) of liquid than I immediately follow it down with a teaspoon of Rose's Lime Juice. I don't even notice the flavor anymore. The small 10Cal you get from the Lime juice is not even worth worrying about for those ""calorie counters"". I do notice many benefits from the product, lower blood pressure, easier erections, increased vascularity, etc. I don't feel the Pre-Work Out pumps though (may not be taking enough). I take 6g in the morning and 6g evening with 30mg Pygogenol. At this price, it wouldn't hurt to try it."
4,Horrible taste,"This may be the worst tasting thing I've ever drank. I started using it as a Pre- workout drink because most pre-wo supps have arginine in them. It's suppose to increase hgh levels and all, don't know if its true, but its definately the cheapest arginine on Amazon. Now I have to buy more supps to make my homemade jack3d. I would recommend it to someone."
3,horrible taste!,"Do not buy if you have a sense of smell or taste buds. i read the reviews and saw that it tasted bad but i figured it would be ok, i was wrong. it smells like man juice and it taste horrible!!! the ONLY way you can take it is with orange juice. the jug says take with juice or water, dont even attempt to take with water. dont buy, go with the pill form. i wont be buying again, i dont even know if i can finish the jug i have. otherwise great amino acid and the more economical choice."
3,Good Product Taste Nasty,If you can overcome the chemical taste then this is for you. I mixed with other powders I use to mitigate the taste. Enough said.
1,L-Arginine from Now,"This is the worst tasting stuff I have ever had. I have been taking L-Arginine for about 10 years in various forms and brands. It does not always taste great, but never this bad. I had to go buy another brand, this stuff is a wast of my money and a throw away."
5,Beautiful Illustrations,"Sylvia Long seems to find a way to make every drawing on every page have hidden detail. My two and half year old kids love to sing ""Twinkle Twinkle"" but this little book makes it every more special. They like the sub-story of the fox lighting the lamp posts and the animal-children going home, eating dinner, and getting ready for bed. Most of all, they notice the detail in the animals' PJs or dinner plates and want to talk about that just as much as read the rhyme.As always, a fabulous book from Ms. Long."
1,Dirty and disgusting!,I got this as a joke gift for my cousin. It ended up in MY TRASH because it was TRASHY!
3,very little in the way of plot,"I found these stories interesting primarily because of the vivid descriptions of the worlds that Volmar and his crew encounter. Sadly, there is very little to the stories other than that. There is really not much contained in these stories in the way of plot or character development. All three stories employ the same formula; the crew is stranded or captured on an alien planet, they encounter nightmarish flora and fauna, and then they escape. I liked the stories for what they are, but if you're looking for stories that contain an actual point (other than to freak the reader out with weird descriptions), these are probably not for you."
1,This product sucks! Stay away (-5 stars!),"If you want this, just go to a 99 cent store or thrift store and buy it from there. The quality will be the same (cheap and low quality and feels fake) and keep your $100 or so cash you will spend on this. Forget about the Tommy brand. I returned this item and got burned with the 15% restocking fee and shipping amounting to $25. I could have bought a decent watch for that restocking price somewhere."
4,still a haunting song,"2Pac was feeling it when he cut this song and hearing Danny Boy on the Hook with the tie in to the video,etc.. was just errie and the whole setting was scary. the song which sampled Debarge's ""a dream"" which has been used by so many artists fit 2Pac's pain and a trip back down memory lane with a Homie. very powerful and he was reflecting where he was at during that particular time period."
4,A good criticism of a great story,Found this in my library while doing research on Faulkner. A very good lit-crit before all the wierdness came into the field. Puts the novel and Faulkner's writing into perspective.
4,celibate aussie's great punk groove,"This is a ""best of"" compilation of the Celibate Rifles spanning almost two decades. The material ranges in sound from early punk to a more thoughtful pop with a hard edge. If you have never heard the Celibate Rifles this is a great get aquainted cd. Their sound is very much in line with the great early Australian punk bands like The Saints, and Radio Birdman. The Celibate Rifles are more consistantly good than The Saints, and more prolific than Radio Birdman. The material on this cd is fairly difficult to find if you don't live in Australia, and the price is right. So if you are even remotely interested in hearing this great band now is your chance."
3,A Soldier's Blade...,"This is the story of a blade, from it's description a celtic blade, with mystical powers. The blade chooses It's owner, not the reverse. It follows the blade through the ages from the conquests of Alexander through Hannibal's retreat from Italy, to the collapse of Roman rule in Briton and beyond. The authors turn of phrase makes you feel like you are sitting in the smoky inn actually listening to the aged warrior telling the tale of the sword. Well worth the read. ""Inn keep! Another flagon of ale!"""
5,Herbie's back,"My kids loved the new Herbie movie, so I thought we'd try some classic Herbie. They love this movie, even though the special effects are not quite what they're used to these days :-)"
5,BRUCE CAMPBELL,"Don't listen to these losers who don't like this movie. I'm a huge b-movie horror fan and I enjoy this tremendously. Has there ever been a bad Bruce Campbell movie? Every time someone says one of his movies are terrible, I watch it to see if these obscenities are true and their of course not!!! This is the Bruce were talking about here, The most epic and sexy man to ever be"
3,Even Bruce Campbell cannot save this,"And you thought Herbie movies died way back in the day! Boy were you wrong! In fact, Herbie is not dead, just out-of-style. There was no need to even attempt to make this film. The only reason I bought it (yes, I bought it) was for Bruce Campbell, but even his great cheesy one-liners could not save this film. In fact, the few one-liners he has aren't even in his cheesy style, making this movie quite a disappointment."
4,Cute movie..def a classic for Herbie Lovers,"This movie is a cute one to have for any Herbie lover. Although, I do have to say, the more recent movies like 'Fully Loaded' have Herbie show a lot more personality, which makes it easier for younger children to fall in love with him. Either way, this is still a Disney classic."
3,Charm can only take the movie so far,"This review contains some vague spoilers.Herbie (the car) is lovable from the start, we all want him to win and be loved by his owner. The charm of the cute little car can't completely make up for the film's many flaws though. The production seems very cheap, and suffers from all the cheap tricks used in film-making at the time. Only the acting of Buddy Hackett stands out as being good, whereas Dean Jones' is truly quite bad. It is completely unrealistic that Jones' character Jim doesn't realize his skills aren't winning the races, and that a Beetle can't go much faster than more powerful cars.I think it's also worth pointing out that the film isn't suitable for toddlers or young children because of the suicide scene, many insults between characters, and the violent intent of the villain."
5,Herbie,"As a new generation of ""Herbie"" fans want to know how ""Herbie"" came to be, I recommend they watch this movie. I watched all the ""Herbie"" movies growing up and saw the new movie, too. You have to watch the original to know the answers to all the questions you might have. I highly recommend this movie for the whole family!"
2,The original is the only way to go!,"This made-for-movie was highly anticipated, but turned out to be a disappointment. While it was great to have a new Herbie movie, the storyline stunk. There were too many liberties taken i.e. the origin of Herbie's name. Bruce Campbell was good, and of course Dean Jones was great, but Alexendra Wentworth was absolutely terrible! If you're a Herbie fan, wait until the price drops...."
2,Herbie's back...but the magic is gone!,"Herbie is stuck starring in a poorly written tv movie where everyone is bored with the script, and it's okay for HERBIE TO DIE! Horace is a evil version of herbie.he's always making strange growling sounds and often wears a dumb smirk on his hood. FYI,HE KILLS HERBIE!!!!!! the writer,well I think he dosen't like herbie. Anyway, when Herbie dies they put him in a coffin, and stand by it for 25 minutes so us kids can cry all we want! Even I ,being in fourth grade, Cried so hard I got my pillow all wet!(in case your wondering,I LOVE HERBIE! and Killing him is a crime!!!!) The rest of the movie was some what enjoyable. The best part of this movie was the end because in this part herbie is safe from all the dangers that he faces in the rest of the film. If you want fun and some respect for the love bug watch the other Herbie movies."
4,sydney surprise,"In February we flew to Sydney, Australia three days prior to boarding a cruise to the west coast of Australia and several Asian countries.We stayed in a hotel that was central to the Quay and Chinatown. On our walk to a delightful Chinese restaurant we ran across a confectioner shop called Darrell Lea. I have always had a sweet tooth for licorice and I spotted a bag of black licorice and asked the clerk if I could sample a piece. She said yes and then I was hooked like a junkie on dope. I bought several bags and asked the clerk if I could buy them in the States. She said she didn't think that was possible.After we returned home from our cruise, my wife and I decided to try to find this delicious confection in our state of Washington. I went on the Internet and found them on Amazon. I ordered two boxes of them and will continue to enjoy one of the most intense licorice candies I have ever had."
4,"Good, but not nearly as good as RJ's","If I had never tasted RJ's liquorice, this would definitely be a top contender. A side by side comparison puts RJ's well above Darrell Lea's. There is something artificial about the Darrell Lea's, starting with the texture which is a little too chewy with a slightly erzatz flavor. The liquorice flavor in both is strong, but much more natural in the RJ's. I prefer the smoother taste and texture of the RJ's, and my father-in-law, a self-proclaimed liquorice expert, can't get enough RJ's. I will buy the Darrell Lea in a pinch, but RJ's is my choice for the best liquorice around."
3,It's OK,I purchased Darrel Lea licorice because it was less expensive than RJ's. If I had never tasted RJ's licorice I would have thought Darrel Lea was very good. RJ's licorice is softer and more flavorful.
4,It's OK but it's not RJ's,I usually order RJ's soft licorice but the price keeps jumping from $15 to $31 for the four pack. I thought I try this brand since RJ's was selling for $31 when I went to order and no licorice is worth $31 for 42oz. Well the Darrell Lea is good but not in the same class as RJ's. I will buy again if RJ's doesn't get the price back to $15.
5,Delicious!,"My husband and I love this soft, rich liquorice made in Australia. It arrived fresh and delectable. The only trouble is, we ate it too, too fast. I think it's time to reorder."
2,sort of ok,"I don't think I realized how soft this 'soft eating' licorice was going to be. It's so soft as to be almost mushy. It has no resistance to bite at all. The flavor is ok, about on par with black twizzlers really. I didn't find the licorice taste to be strong enough. It's very mild. I bought this over my usual Katjes licorice, as it was convenient, but I don't think I'll be trying it again. If you like a stronger licorice taste with that little hit of ammonia, pass this up for a good Dutch or German variety."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS RJ'S,I accidentally picked this brand up because RJ's and Darrell's packaging look so similar. This licorice is good but I will pay the higher price any day to have RJ's.
2,Liquorice amount smaller,"The amount of liquorice in this order appears much less than my last order. I still have a few packages from my previous and when compared, the latest order appears much lighter.Thank You,Richard Farrah"
1,Poor product,Very poor quality licorice the only licorice worth buying is Panda .panda is far and away the best.and I have been buying licorice for 70 years
5,Excellent,"Excellent! The licorice is the real thing for sure, is very fresh and extremely flavorful. The price makes this an all around fabulous deal."
5,Amazing authentic liquorice!,"If you live in the US, you've likely never tasted real black liquorice. What we've got here is anise-flavored candy, which is similar, but nowhere near as good as the real thing. Do yourself a favor and try this! Perfect soft texture and deep flavor.But as with anything, don't over-do it. There are some side-effects if you eat lots of it every day (high blood pressure, electrolyte imbalance)."
1,"Weird, overpowering aftertaste","The taste, at first, is the sharp, not-too-sweet flavor of licorice that I like. By the time the first bite was swallowed, however, I noticed a very strong chemical aftertaste that overrides the licorice goodness. I found the overall experience of eating this licorice to be unpleasant, so will stick to my favorite Kookaburra Black Licorice, in spite of the fact that it is more expensive.Kookaburra Licorice, Black, 10-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 4)"
4,Great reference book,"This book is great for reference work; it has almost everything. As for CEUs, the test is difficult because the questions use different terms for pathologies than the book does. Extra research is necessary and sometimes quite difficult. If you are up for the challenge, buy it!"
3,Works Well,"This card works well and the price is right! Kingston's standard cards are 12x (about 1.8 MB/sec), which is about as fast as any 3.2 MP camera needs.No corrupt files in any of these cards yet!If you have a higher megapixel camera (4 MP and up), I would recommend the Sandisk Ultra compactflash card, which has a maximum write speed of about 60x (although reaching this speed probably won't happen for all cameras because cameras themselves have a maximum write speed).To figure out about how much memory a card will hold with a specific camera, take the following formula, which is a rough approximation:# of Pictures = 3*(megabites on card)/(megapixels)So, a 3 megapixel camera can store approximately 250 pictures on a 256 MB card."
1,buy twenty thousand by david n meyer... this book is not accurate,besides the cool pics in this book.... the author has seemed to have forgotten that u can not make up things in a biography... she puts her own thoughts into the book as if they were grams... the book is very inaccurate... the author doesnt even have a bibliography its like wikapedia u can not trust it... do not buy it... twenty thousand roads by david n meyer is the best and most accurate bio on gram and it comes with a very detailed bibliography so u know its real and not some dumb opinion from a moronic author... shame on jessica hundley for wirtting this book..
1,"Goofy, indulgent waste of money--STAY AWAY!","The Ben Fong-Torres book is much more thoroughly researched, and doesn't rely on the ridiculous invented dialogue that Hundley imagines went on between Parsons and his friends.If GP was as shallow and moronic as he's portrayed in this book, he could never have written and recorded the beautiful, moving music that he left us.In addition, Hundley interviews anyone she can think of, including her own friends and people who never had anything to do with Parsons.WTF?"
3,gram parsons,I am a big fan of gram parsons and jump on anything I can with regard to his history...the information was correct and the book contained some photos that I had never seen...one day read
2,Good quality filter but a pain to assemble.,Good quaility filter but a pain to assemble. Every time I replace it I have to try to remember how to put it together. They could make the thing better for easier assembly.
2,No interest from toddler,2 1/2 year old took no interest whatsoever to this. Doesn't mean your child won't. Buy with caution or try to find on-line for demo prior to purchasing:)
5,"Excellent color photography, concise history rate A-1","Now that the BN is another vanished corporate identity, it's quite lucky we rail enthusiasts have such a fine, classy publication that summarizes the forerunnings, beginnings and contemporary era of the BN. Excellent shots of GN, NP, CB&Q, and SP&S lead to still more beautiful images of a far-reaching Western rail empire. The text is highly engaging and manages to appeal to not only the die-hard railfans, but those who are just exploring the subject."
1,POORLY MADE,THIS FILM IS NOT VERY ENTERTAINING AND WILL DEFINITELY NOT PLEASE ACTION FANS. THE ACTION SCENES IN THIS FILM ARE MUNDANE. HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED.
1,Horrible!,"Not only did they mess up on the Subway legend...but the way that they just fabricated technical details about a subway train, ruined the movie for me. Subway trains have AIR BRAKES. You cannot ""bleed"" air brakes. A subway train cannot repeatedly ram into the back of another train. It's not even supposed to be THAT close to another train without the air brakes going ""into emergency"", thereby stopping the train cold. The reverser? A ""stick-shift""? LOL! Too much.This is for fans of Wesley, Woody or J-Lo. Otherwise, do yourself a favor...stay away from this film, and buy ""The Taking Of Pelham 123"" with Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw. It is an INFINITELY better film, and much more satisfying. GUARANTEED!!!"
4,"Great Movie for Snipes, Harrelson, or Lopez fans!!","I'll admit the movie's plot leaves much to be desired but if your a fan of Wesley Snipes, Woody Harrelson, or the heavenly Jennifer Lopez then this is a movie that you would enjoy. The action was great, and it kept me into the movie. Though, with Jennifer, there was no leaving anyway."
2,Formulaic and predictable,"If this were a cartoon, then it would at least not have the pretension of being something that it's not: a sophisticated adult action thriller. The black guy/white guy cop buddy schtick has been done to death: Lethal Weapon etc etc. There's never a moment here when you can't see what's coming next. We do get to see Robert Blake pre-murder charge, and he isn't too bad as the villainous subway boss obsessed with his money train. The hijinks engaged in by Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes (pre-IRS problems) are at least mostly on foot instead of the standard car chase. Jennifer Lopez was riding a wave in 1995, but doesn't have much to do."
5,One of my favorite childrens' books of all time!,"I spent ages looking for this book and was thrilled when I finally found it. Mercer Meyer's East of the Sun West of the Moon remains on of my favorite childrens' books of all time, not only for it's beautiful illustrations, but also for the beauty of the simple tale."
4,We live in a new world for which we have no experience.,"This book was published 20 years ago. Although its examples may be dated, the author's message is even more true today than it was in 1977. That message is that technological change has forced us into more and more situations for which we have little or no relevant experience. Things that were once the province of science fiction are now affecting the lives of ordinary people. Biological breakthroughs like in vitro fertilization, gene splicing, and cloning are raising legal and social questions which have no precedent. No wonder nothing seems to work anymore because our past experience has not prepared us to deal with situations no one has ever experienced before. The book may not exactly be reassuring but it does make the point that we shouldn't be so hard on ourselves if things don't seem to work anymore...because things have changed!"
5,Changing the world one relationship at a time,"This is the best book on relationships I have ever found. Gay and Kathlyn Hendricks show ways in which people trip themselves up while relating to others and how to overcome these personal issues by working on yourself.Even if you decide not to do the assignments in part II I suggest you at least read them. They can provide additional insight.If you want to get a deeper idea of how your family system may have influenced your current relationships then make it a double feature and read ""Broken Toys Broken Dreams"" by Terry Kellogg, which you can also find on his website http://www.liferesources.com/tinfo.htmlAnother good book is ""Bradshaw On: The Family"" by John Bradshaw.These books dovetail nicely with ""Conscious Loving""."
5,Learning to Love Healthy,I found this book remarkable for its clear and practical steps for behaving consciously toward a partner. The commitments described are very liberating as they can be used no matter what your partner may be doing. Very empowering.
5,A book to live by,"I picked up a copy of this book when my brother gave his to our father, saying, ""I couldn't find another one, but this is so important that I'm giving you my own.""Since then, I've filled it with underlines, markings, and marginal notes, built long and loving relationships on its principles, and loved it so thoroughly that I've rebound it a few times with medical tape from my first-aid kit.And the book has returned the favor; it has restored the binding of myself - that which keeps me together, maintains my integrity - each time I return to it for aid.It's hard for me now to tease out which parts of myself were learned as a result of reading this book. So much of who I am in the world is informed and/or inspired by these ideas. When I return to them, wherever I am, it keeps getting better."
5,Great pot to keep,"I was so excited when this round roaster arrived. I had the dutch oven pot in white from Le Creuset and tried to find another brand of white colour cast iron cookware. It is so good that DBK has the white colour round roaster and the price is two times cheaper.The roaster is definitely a keeper, heat well and has the same effects as my other ""L"" pots."
3,"Great movie, but no widescreen!","Unforunately, this great movie got bad treatment when Disney decided to make a DVD of it full screen only. Why is it so hard to release a movie in its original aspect ratio?Also, the original ""Incredible Journey"" can't even be found on DVD here. You have to buy it in Europe."
5,Heartwarming Film,"Homeward Bound is the best one I've ever seen.I think Walt must be jumping up and down in his grave for this one. It is a great heatwarming film. I love this movie.I even watched it this morning, and I will again today."
5,Especially Wonderful for Children of the 90's.,"This is one of the best movies from my childhood - a movie made before CGI, before animals had mouths that moved, before special effects took over a majority of the film. This film made me smile, laugh, and cry. I'm almost 23 now, and I can go back to my old VHS copy of this film and still feel the same emotions I had when I was younger. It will always be one of those family films that withstands the test of time, and will bring a tug at the heart for anyone who watches it. Being a part of the generation who went from VHS to DVDS, internet downloads, and so forth; I can promise you this movie withstands the test of time, and still is a joy to watch with your parents, siblings, and friends REGARDLESS of age. It is pleasure on all emotional levels, and rewards your tears. Definitely a good classic movie for anyone who grew up in the 90's!!"
4,KIDS WORE THE VHS OUT WHEN YOUNGER!,"My first child (now 16) wore this video out and LOVED it! So, i'm replacing it with a DVD for my younger one and the one with autism. Awesome family classic in my opinion! Funny! And it has a happy ending! Love Michael J Fox, Sally Field & Don Ameche voices.... PERFECT casting!"
4,Very awsome picture.,"Very beautiful pictures and scenery. The story was very moving between the animals and the children, but I was a little vague about why they were sent to the farm. Anyway, it was not important but the story was unfolded nicely and the lesson learned by the puppy was awsome. The relationship between the animals was one that I always believe in and found so true in the animal word. I wish the human lelationship could be the same."
2,"Movie was great, quality, bleh..big turnoff? SUBTITLES.","We rented this movie through amazon prime for a family night, since we could not find the movie on the RedBox, and movie rental clubs are practically extinct. The movie was OK, we had hiccups during play, probably due to our connection. However, the part that disappointed the most is that we are used to having subtitles turned on in our movies. Amazon Prime does not offer subtitles in the movies they rent. Don't know if I'll rent again."
4,Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey,This movie would have to be one of the best animal movies of all time. My whole family loved it (adults and kids). I highly recommend this movie to any animal lovers.
5,"Dogs rule and Cats drule, the debate goes on.","Dogs rule and Cats drule, or is it the other way around... the debate goes on in our house. If you judge a family oriented movie by how often the kids ask to see it, and then they actually watch it this movie and its sequel are winners."
4,the nicest movie about animals,"i like the scene with the cougar attack,and the bear attack. The animals are well trained,and you can see that! The courage of this three animals,the adventure,and the friendship:see it!"
5,Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey,"This is a wonderful story. I saw it on television several years ago and loved it. I recently purchased the DVD and every time my grandchildren come to visit, that's the one they want to see over all the others and I watch it with them and enjoy it every time."
5,Love it,"I have always loved this movie, even though it makes me cry every time. I don not like giving reviews on here. I shouldn't have to use so many words. More than I wanted to use."
4,Fun movie for the family,I watched this movie when I was a little kid and I loved the pets and the voice acting. It's more active then a film like milo and otis and it was easier for me to relate to. I bought this due to the nostalgia and seeing chance freak out about chickenzilla was always a fun thing. It holds up as a great family film.
5,Dogs,Purchased for our granddaughter. She will receive it for Valentine's Day and will be most happy to get it. It appears to be in fine condition.
1,Great movie bad DVD,"I love this movie it is funny and inventive. I hate to say but this DVD stinks. It has no extras, two channel sound, and the worst fullscreen only. Release a better version. NOW."
5,Great movie,My granddaughter was not sure she wanted to watch this movie. I told her to start and if she did not like it we would watch another. She loved it and now it is her favorite.
5,The family loves this!!!,"This movie is great. Its funny, sad , and lots of action. The family likes it so much we just bought a dog just like the dog ""Chance"" from this film."
5,Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey,"This movie was the best I've ever seen. I love animals a lot.A family moves to San Fransisco; leaving a freind on a farm to watch their pets. Sassy(the cute, prissy, and fun-loving himalayan)is stuck with her dog friends, Shadow and Chance. The three pets go on a journey through the mountains, trying to find their way home. The adventure goes from huge grizzlies to wild mountain lions."
5,"Heart, courage and laughter",This movie is about two dogs (Shadow and Chance) and a cat (Sassy). There owners have to go away on a long buisness trip for 3 month and they leave there pets with a friends. The pest decide that they have to go find them so they set out on a jouney through the wilderness. This is a great family movie!
5,timely delivery,"The movie I ordered was delivered ahead of schedule and is in perfect condition. Once again, Amazon does the job!"
4,For the Animal Lover in Us All,"I avoided this film at first because I felt they ""cartoonized"" Sheila Burnford's original novel and the original Disney movie, which I remember seeing on the weekly television series. But seen as a stand-alone this is a fun film about three animals trying to make their way back to their family. The animals are provided voice-over thoughts by Don Ameche (as elderly Shadow), Michael J. Fox (as Chance, the young, recently adopted dog who doesn't trust the humans not to abandon him), and Sally Field (as Sassy, the sarcastic Himilayan cat), and the story is more light than Burnford's original, although there are many touching moments as well. One BIG point off for Disney failing to release this film in letterbox. Apparently they just Don't Get It."
5,Best animal movie of all time.,"This is one of those rare movies that the whole family can enjoy - and you don't have to worry about the kids hearing or seeing anything they shouldn't. I've seen it over and over and really never tire of it. The acting (from both human and animals) is great. So is the scenery. This movie is truly wonderful and no matter how many times I see it I still wonder if old Shadow is going to make it over that hill, home to his boy."
4,Great family film,I've seen this movie many many times and it still feels fresh and sweet after every viewing. Its a beautifully made movie with a great message and familys everywhere should see this if they haven't already.
2,Are There Two Sick People Here?,Obler and Clavin present the reader with the tale of a mind game. Readers who enjoy reading about or playing mind games may appreciate this book. Those who don't will spend a lot of time wondering which character shows more pathology - the doctor or the psychopath
1,Marketing fiction as non-fiction,"Martin Obler & Thomas Clavin are presenting what is clearly a fictional book as a non-fictional work and are giving psychologists a bad name in the process. Obler and Clavin portray the ""Soda Pop Slasher"" as a sexually sadistic serial killer in N.Y. with more than a dozen kills to his name. Yet, no murders similar to those described in their book seem to have occured there or elsewhere. It is disturbing that Obler repeatedly states that he adheres to the highest ethical standards, yet he seems to be peddling fantasy as fact. Where are the ethics in this? This Book is as readable as a tabloid, but buyer beware. - Kelly G"
4,Its is an excellent book,You will probably doubt if this book is true and most likely disagree with the author. I found the story to be really interesting wether true or not. If you do read this book notice the irrational thinking of Dr Obler. Dr Obler convinced himself a deposit box could be his shield but he must have known that Devon was smart enough to go around it.
3,"Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down.","This was a very interesting book, and the author's treatment of the serial killer was facinating. For a newcomer to the field of mystery writing, in my opinion Dr. Obler has a great future."
2,Ann Rule needn't worry!,"This ""story"" really didn't do much for me. EVEN IF it is true, the writing failed to keep me interested; I finished the book simply because that's what I always do. Ann, baby, I'm comin' back to you! Anyone read Bitter Harvest yet?"
4,Which is more evil?...,Short thought: It is a definitely an entertaining page-turner. Long thought: IF this story is based on true events...then I don't place the doctor on much better ground than the killer. For the doctor to let innocent people die in order to keep his professional reputation intact is as close to being as despicable and selfish as the murderer's actions.
3,While many comments true reasons are not,"I should start by saying that I am the author's son and wrote part of the original text. The original text was completely based in fact with some dramatic license mostly in the dialogue. The murders were real, although some anachronisms were present. However, the book was basically rewritten by the publisher without the consent of the author and greatly fictionalized. Even worse, the publisher did a poor job of this, hence the comments that the kidnapping did not ring true. The book is still valuable for its insights into the moral dilemnas of doctor-patient confidentiality, if you ignore the obvious Hollywood intrusions of the misguided publisher."
2,Fatal Stupidity,"I'm puzzled as to how this book can be described as non-fiction. The authors' note states that ""names, events and locations"" have been changed and ""chronology has been altered."" That doesn't leave much does it? What more is there to a story beyond names, events, locations and chronology?The most infuriating aspect of the book was Dr Obler's obsession with remaining ""objective"". I was puzzled as to what exactly he meant by ""objective"" and eventually reached the conclusion that for Dr Obler it was synonymous with ""very, very stupid"". As the evidence began to mount that his client was a serial killer, Dr Obler valiantly and ""objectively"" pushed such thoughts from his mind. It was only when his patient started to threaten members of Dr Obler's own family that it slowly began to dawn on him that perhaps he should do a little bit more than have a weekly chat with this man. Very ""objective""."
2,Questionable morals by Dr. Obler,"This book, while well-written and engrossing ultimately shows the reason why average citizens despise the field of psychiatry, psychology, etc. Dr. Obler's sacrifice of innocent victims is abhorrent."
2,"Despicable, infuriating","As I read this book, I assumed that eventually Dr. Obler would resolve his inner conflict regarding patient confidentiality and turn his psychopath patient in to the police. I was horrified when I reached the end of the book and learned that he DID NOT! I find Dr. Obler's behavior despicable and his actions infuriating. The bottom line is this: Hiding behind the cloak of patient confidentiality privilege, this arrogant S.O.B. (I'm referring to the Doc) placed his career interests before that of protecting the public. While he ""struggled"" with his conscience, a half dozen people were murdered -- and all because he was afraid of losing a few patients. If I were seeing a therapist, and that therapist broke confidentiality with one of his/her patients becuase the patient was a SERIAL KILLER, I would commend the doctor, not ""fire"" him! I have a hard time believing this story is true. Dr. Obler should be in jail."
2,Dumb Dr. Obler,"I gave this book two stars because of how dumb Dr. Obler was. Dr. Obler is a psychologist who is evaluating a new patient named Devon. During their sessions, killings start to happen. Dr. Obler expects Devon is the killer. Dubbed ""The Soda Pop Slasher,"" the killer used broken glass to cut up his victims. Dr. Obler had numerous chances to go to the police and tell them who ""The Soda Pop Slasher"" was. Instead, he chooses not to so he can keep his license as a psychologist. By doing this many more murders were committed by the slasher. In the end, in my own opinion, no one wins because this Devon person is still out there."
1,total non fiction,"I was attracted to this book for its alledged non-fiction psychological slant to serial murder. Instead I got a fictional hero who was neither the self proclaimed keeper of all professional ethics nor a brave hero. It was a semi thriller but not credible. This doc not only kept his therapy confidential, but allowed disturbing criminal behavior to occur before his eyes and to his most beloved people. Beyond believe. Call it fiction and leave it at that. Illogical fiction but totally fiction. Check the book out of the Library and leave it at that."
1,Bad Fiction,"I cannot imagine that this stuff really happened-- and if it's pure fiction, it is not very good. Is this, perhaps, a new marketing ploy? Take a third-rate novel and claim it's true to attract readers?"
3,Unbelievable,"If you believe this book, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I'd like to sell you. How could the good doctor parade his ignorance before the public like this? He keeps getting dumber and dumber as the story progresses. I think Devon actually killed him and took his place."
4,carver's glove,Excellent safety item to give to grandson along with carving tools. Protects from cuts while using tools yet is flexible and makes it easy to handle wood.
3,Fairly good score for a dodgy movie,"Back in good old 1986 when I walked out of Raw Deal at the cinema in its opening half hour, the only thing I wasn't shaking my head about was the groovy score. Although Raw Deal was a shocking film, some of the tracks on this CD are fairly good listening material. I can't believe that Cinemascore (who the hell are they?) were able to be inspired to create such a powerful and chromatic score from what would have been a seemingly pointless film. Highlight track is ""Harry Shot"", although its upbeat theme with lively guitars and horns does not quite match the scene considering Arnie's friend has just been gunned down. The length of the soundtrack is a little dissapointing - Overall a good (but not great) score to an awful film."
3,Dread Pirate,"The game is very well made and fun to play, however the outside of the box indicates that it is for 2-4 players. The instructions say that it is a game for 4 players. We only have 3 in our household and could not complete all the moves on the game board with less than 4 players. There was no modification in game rules to accomodate less than 4 players."
2,"quality materials, limited fun",This product is made of great materials and authentic looking game parts. The only problem is the rules of the game that need improved. It lacks a good point to the game and how to get there. There is little chance for strategy with the main ploy being the roll of the dice.
3,Somewhat over-rated.,"Agree with the reviews about the durability/quality of the gameand the disorganization of the rule book. We've played it 4 times and we keep having to refer back to the rule book, and usually discover we've been playing wrong. This game would benefit if there was a condensed copy of the rules for each player. It takes about an hour to play a game. It's been fun to play this game after a ""Shipwreck"" themed dinner."
4,Impressive quality,"I was a little reluctant to purchase this game for my son who is only 7 because I thought it might be too difficult for him to enjoy. But since he was fascinated by pirates this year (ie. Lego Pirates), I decided to give it to him for Christmas. We were all impressed with quality and beauty of this toy, including my son. The game calls for 2-4 players but it is best to play with 4. We played as a family and he picked it up very quickly. We stuck to the basic directions, but it includes additional ways to play to make the game more interesting. I suspect he will enjoy playing this game for years to come. P.S. The wooden book box is pretty enough to keep out on display."
3,Not sure if this works that well.,"I've been taking this product for six nights now. It doesn't make me drowsy at all. I expected it to take a few nights to kick in and make me sleepy, but the only thing that I've noticed differently the past couple of nights is that I've had some pretty vivid dreams including a nightmare last night which involved my ex-husband ....lolI usually don't remember dreams nor am I aware that I'm having them so I thought it unusual, but who knows.I've taken 4 pills each night. Unless it takes longer for this ""natural"" stuff to work on the system, I give it a thumbs down. If it starts working I'll come back and post.The one good thing I will say, is that once I actually do fall asleep, I seem to be staying asleep without waking up as I often do, so that deserves one thumb up and three stars, but I won't buy it again unless it starts making me sleepy here pretty soon! Scrabble,.. anyone? :)Maybe I'll have a good dream tonight instead of a nightmare....(wink wink)"
2,Meh,"I've been taking two tablets a night for a couple of weeks now and I haven't really noticed any difference in my sleep. I find better results when I just take a valerian tablet. I like that it has magnesium in it, which I'm usually deficient in. It's replaced my calcium-magnesium supplement at night, but that's cheaper than this. I love their Life Force vitamins, but the NutraSleep is just pretty much meh."
4,Better for anxiety than sleep,"I got this to help me deal with some PTSD-related insomnia. I don't necessarily think it really helps me fall asleep, but what I do notice is that I feel much more relaxed the entire next day when I take it. For that reason, I just ordered my third bottle."
3,Good Resource,"Being a teacher, but not a parent - this book gave a great perspective about how and why helicopter parents react the way they do. It's an easy read and offers relevant, helpful advice."
1,tactful teacher,I bought this book for a class. I feel it was a waste of money as the information was common sense-type information.
2,It's o.k.,"It's o.k. the light doesn't stay in place and it makes it akward to use. To see the quick well the light needs to shine towards you, then you have a light in your eye."
4,Unforgettably powerful; Absolutely great and absolutely horrifying,"I wish I would have been a bit older when I met Harlan Ellison; then maybe I wouldn't have been so intimidated. He is passionate and has the mastery over words to wield power greater than mere mortals. Not that agree with everything he says; far from it. As far as his collection of short stories is concerned, two stand out since I read them more than a decade ago:""I have no mouth but I must scream"" is horrifying; I wish I could forget it.""Blind Lightning"" is just as powerful, and I am very glad that I will remember it for the rest of my days. Makes the book worth buying even if the price were 10 times as much."
2,Didnt have the product,"Sorry guys - they dint have the product as advertised, or they couldnt find it. Either way it was a little disappointing and I wasnt in the mood for a bait and switch."
1,Cheap,This trap is cheaply made and ripped while we were putting it over our travel trailer. Very disappointed with this product.
3,a bit thin,"For the price I shouldn't have expected much better. We bought it to cover our travel trailer, The size is great, covered our 26ft. trailer. Just was pretty thin. For the price we paid though it will do the job and get us through a couple of winters if we'rearefull with it."
3,NOT good to wear with shoes,"Blisters feet. Without shoes, a little uncomfortable on the sole of the foot, but all around it's a helpful product."
5,OLD SCHOOL NATION!!!,"This is one of the times that Rhino got it right. All of the tracks here (actually, in this series) are presented in their full, unedited rump-shaking glory. Most notable here is the 12"" version of Funkadelic's ""One Nation Under a Groove,"" which, if you remember, when it first came out, was a promotional-only 12"" that we were endlessly teased with by the radio stations and select DJs who were fortunate enough to have a copy. After much bitching and threats by us (the buying public), the label responded to our demands and released it, almost a year after the original mix came out! The guitar riffs of this version and clocking in at 11-minutes plus makes this CD worth the price alone! The other tracks on the disc do not disappoint either! You can throw one HELL of an ""ol' skool"" party with this disc, and the rest of the discs in this series as well! Enjoy!"
4,Great Locker,"This locker looks great when put together. It arrived in perfect condition with all the parts, and in the correct color. The parts are minimal, it is just three sides, a top and bottom, the door with frame connected, a shelf and the hardware. I would have given this item five stars except it was challenging to put together. It took two people to hold the pieces for me while I screwed the screws a few times. Other than that I thought this was perfect item. The shelf is sturdy, and so is the hanging bar. It was exactly what I needed."
1,Shouldn't Lockers Have Locks?,"When I bought this product, I assumed that I would be able to lock it with a simple lock, even if I had to purchase the lock separately. Instead, this LOCKer is no more than a simple shelving unit."
3,Minor dents and paint chipping during shipping,"I gave this product a 3 of 5 stars because it fit my needs, and is of the quality that I expected. It lost a few stars because one of the corners was bent slightly, there were paint chips, and a few minor dents on the door. Locker would be great for a teenager its trendy and neat.. It's easy to put together, and comes with all the necessary parts. If this product would have shipped a little better it would be perfect! FYI- make sure that you pay attention to the dimensions it is a relatively short locker."
3,A souvenir of Mehta's best period,"Zubin Mehta was such a media star in the early stages of his career that nobody asked whether he had the potential to grow as a musician, his great gift being external gloss and excitement. As he aged, Mehta settled into comfortable routine, but during his beginnings in Los Angeles, he was ""it."" This CD is a typical plush performance in excellent Decca sonics that make the orchestra sound more resplendent than it actually was.Today there are half a dozen better played and recorded versions of the Alpine Symphony from Kempe, Karajan, Blomstedt, Previn, Haitink, and the recent Welser-Most. In retrospect Mehta offers little in the way of breadth or insightful phrasing--his tempos could be somewhat lifeless even back then--yet this reading makes for a good romp up the slope and back down again. His remake on Sony with the Berlin Phil. demonstrates much greater orchestral virtuosity and no serious decline in energy."
5,Gurf pegged it this time !!!,"Listening to Toad of Titicaca while i write this, which is a good CD, but sounds more like Jim Lauderdale's style( which certainly isnt a bad thing ! )...However, Diamonds to Dust is more real, more raw, more Gurf ...this is the best CD I've bought in a while...I was introduced to Gurf through Ray Wylie's "" Snake Farm"", and i'm sure glad of it....THIS is what real music is...soul ripping emotion, sung from the voice of experience...."
5,Excellent Dog Training Advice,"I highly recommend this book for people who are serious about training their dogs. This method of dog training works because it is specific to the dog's particular needs and personality. My border collie couldn't care less about getting a treat for doing a good job, but if you toss him a tennis ball or a frisbee he's the happiest dog in the world!! This book focusses on training your dog based on his specific personality.I highly recommend this book, and I plan to keep it handy as a guide for dealing with the ingenious things my sometimes too smart border collie tries to get away with!"
1,If you want positive - find another book,"Kathy may have been doing dog training for 20+ years but she isn't staying current with what's happening in dog training. Sure she implies that she is using positive training because she's using food, but she's also telling people how to correctly leash pop their dog. Even with the food training she's using 'okay' as a release word which means that anytime that your dog hears this word in a conversation around it, it is ok for it to break from whatever behavior it was currently doing.If you want a New Jersey dog trainer check out Pamela Dennison and her great books - The Complete Idiot's Guide to Positive Dog Training, How to Right a Dog Gone Wrong, Bringing Light to Shadow: A Dog Trainer's Diary. I would also highly recommend Pat Miller's Positive Perspectives: Love Your Dog, Train Your Dog, or The Power of Positive Dog Training."
5,I Feel Orange Today - Wonderful Book!,"Someone gave us this book as a baby gift and we've been reading it to our son for some time now. He really enjoys it; it provides a nice description of feelings in a context in which a child can comprehend. Our son is too young to understand the definitions of emotions, as he is only 16 months old, but it has a very peaceful rhythm to it, is very beautifully illustrated, and really holds his attention. It's a great book to add to your child's library, as it is one that can be used through ages 4-5 years old, since that's about when they might understand more about feelings and emotions."
2,Too small,I was dissapointed because the book is too small to be read as an aloud story for kindergaten students. The site did not specified on the size of the book.
4,FINALLY!!!,"Finally, a way to see some of the weirdest music videos EVER made. Not just the Chris Cunningham videos (including the original of Autechre's 'Second Bad Vilbel' not the [superior] re-edited version on his DVD) but also WEIRD videos for the likes of LFO, Plaid, Antipop Consortium, Squarepusher, Autechre and, of course, Aphex Twin... They're not all good... but the great ones might qualify as some of the best music videos ever made (and with 32 videos, it's hard to be spot-on all the time). It's also a great way to hear some new and old electronic music.the extra CD is OK too."
5,Suuuhhhweeeeet,"This is the greatest collection out there for people who enjoy actual music. I personally love every single video on here, and for fans of popular artists such as Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, and Autechre, youll be happy to find that there are many other groups making amazing electronica music. No this video is not for the MTV generation. This is all coming from an electronica artist himself, you will love these songs and videos, they are amazing, and they're is a better collection here then on any other DVD including the Chris Cunningham collection, more diversity people, its amazing, and you know it. So grab some doobage and get ready for some mind expansion."
2,Don't waste your money,Not that good. You're better off buying Chris Cunninghan's DVD or Bjorks Gratest Hits. They are the only reason Warp Films is still in bissness
2,Very Little to do with C++,"A better title would be the Essence of Non-Object Oriented Programming (using c++ as illustration).The final paragraph of the last page of the last chapter includes the following:""Then you will need to learn about the additional concepts of classes and objects, inheritance and polymorphism. ... See the bibliography for books on the subject"".The title states that it is to be the essence of programming in c++ book, yet includes neither 'class' nor 'object' in the index. This could mislead many of those who think that they will gain any experience of how to write a serious c++ program.As a book on procedural programming, I am sure it follows a well tested route through this approach."
5,For the Millions and Millions,"My favorite astrology book ever. I have the older hardback version with a 1940s copyright as well as the current version. Regardless of the copyrighted date the book is the best. The current version brings in examples of recent celebrities and politicians to help the reader understand traits and characteristics. Even though the writing style has been updated, it does not, in any way, make the book any less valuable. This is a fantastic book for beginners and intermediates to help develop and improve their chart delineation skills. If, after reading this book, a person can not create a logical and cohesive chart reading, then that person is just not trying very hard to learn astrology!"
3,Not all the pages are useful!,"My daughter and I fell in love with the book. She is starting to read in Russian, so this book is a great support for her vocabulary and her reading skills in both languages. The reason I gave it only 3stars is that there are 6 pages in the middle of the book that are in 3 languages:English-Arabic and Turkish(or Iranian?)languages, and not Russian! So those 6 pages are no help to us, they are absolutely useless!"
5,Shabby Chic Candle Chandelier,"Love this product! It looks great in my bedroom but I should have bought 2 as they would look even better besides my bed instead of just one corner. Yes, I would recommend to others."
5,The Bartender's Black Book: The Drink Recipe Collection,This book is excellent. My husband works part-time at a liquor store and they have a copy there to help the customer's know what goes into their drinks at a bar. That way if they want they can purchase what they need to make them at home. The book is awesome. I'm always referring to it at the store so I decided I'd like a copy for at home. So I ordered it online from Amazon.com.
3,"Great for bartenders, not great for browsing by ingredient","This book is great for bartenders, as it has about every drink imaginable. If you're looking for something specific, its organized alphabetically making that easy. If you're more casually looking for something to try, based on what you have available in your home bar, for example, its difficult to browse and find something you like. It's all there, its just difficult to find. Organizing the recipes into chapters according to their base would have been more helpful."
3,Absolutely no pictures!,"It does seem to have an awful lot of recipes crammed in there, but I was looking for a book with a bunch of curiosity-provoking, colorful pictures... something to make a guest say ""hey, I want one of those!"" It looks like a phone book inside-- lots of small writing, listing one drink after another."
2,Pretty but slippery.,My feet slip around in my shoes with these socks and they don't absorb the moisture as well as more traditional fuzzy socks. Won't buy them again.
2,DECEPTIVE COVER PAGE,"Except for about 16 color plates, all the reproductions are in black and white. Would not recommend if you are interested in the color plates. From the front cover, it looks like all the reproductions would be in color, which is not the case."
1,just problems,"Same probleme for the output, no way to connect it to anything else than HDMI, but in my case I do have an HDMI screen and it's simply black... unit was sent back once so far, and still doesn't work. Having read the above now I'm just tempted to give it away and stop thinking about it, thinking i probably made some young geek happy for a couple of months ;)I'm really giving it one star because amazon won't let me leave it unrated...Don't buy it."
1,No output -- confusing specifications,"Specifications talked about S-Video, Composite, DVI outputs. The only true output is HDMI. Composite according to Sony doesn't show any good pictures. It is a totally useless system unless you want to buy an HDMI Plasma or LCD TV. I told Sony that they were crooks for selling such a system and they said that the people I bought it from were the crooks for not letting me know that I would have to buy another TV to use it. I bought it from Tiger Direct and they will not let me return it, so I guess they are crooks."
5,Excellent,"I had been taking timed release B12 tablets, but eventually they were bothering my stomach. The spray solved that problem and has no negatives of its own. Works great.My B12 level was 213 and my doctor said they usually begin treatment when it is 400. My next test was about one month after I started using the spray and my level was up to 1150. My doctor said she had never seen a B12 level rise so far so fast."
4,Nice product,"This is a difficult product to evaluate because of how subtle the results of using it can be. It has a really nice flavor. I do wish it was the methylcobalamin rather than the cyanocobalamin, but the dosage is quite high, so that may make up for the lesser absorption rate of the cyanocobalamin. I will make sure it is methyl next time."
2,"Useful, but expensive","I agree that these gel pads feel absolutely wonderful on sore cracked nipples. However, you can buy something called Second Skin MoistBurn Pads for much less $, and I think they work a bit better even. The lactation consultants at the hospital gave them to me, I bought the Gerber ones, but found the Second Skin pads to be cheaper and nicer. Hope that helps someone! (You can get the pads at Target or places like that.)"
3,ok in a pinch,"these were definitely soothing and much better than the platex version, which are gooey and messy, but these weren't quite as good at the Medela brand and don't even come close to the relief of the Ameda Hydrogels and don't last nearly as long.definitely spend the few extra dollars to get the Ameda ComfortGel pads - one set of those lasts about a week, which ends up being more than a whole box of these."
2,I loved this watch-- until the problem with the paint on the buttons.,Great-looking watch with fatal flaw. The paint on the buttons started to come-off soon after I stated using-- making top buttons unreadable after awhile.
1,cheap,"really bad,leaked the first time i used it real bad workmanship hated it wish i had return it,i would not buy anything from this company again"
3,Well?.................,"It is informative( IF...you can stay AWAKE! )very dull, monotone & drug out. Poorly made sort of like a home video. Audio sounds very cheep and tinnie. I expected more from Tim LaHaye! Hard to watch very long!"
5,Just Great!,I am half american half turkish airforce military brat. I can vouch that the attitudes and ways in the book in the time it was written and even in general today are the turkish people.It is a great way to understand the culture. I first read this book after finding it my fathers library when I was 18. I read it as almost his own stories from his stationing there earlier on.
1,Not the best!,"As a BIG fan of Sister Act, I was very excited that a sequel was made. I was let down. Sister Act 2 was so boring. This movie had poor writing and a sorry plot. There was no excitement in the movie- just a bunch of useless singing. It was too much of a musical instead of a comedy. Bill Duke did a sorry job."
3,SISTER ACT 2,This movie is not as good as Sister Act! The first one was better and funnier! This movie was dull and boring - the jokes were not funny - the acting was horrible - the singing was ok.
5,Bought the Set,"Purchased this movie along with the original Sister Act. Both funny, clean, feel good movies! Great characterizations and super musical numbers. Who knew Whoopi could be a nun?"
3,Fond memory of the movie,"I enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't a blockbuster hit by any means. It was a decent follow up the the first one."
4,almost as good as the first,"didn't like it quite as much as the first one, but still a good movie. would definitely recommend checking out. for the price, might as well pick it up!"
4,Miss Sister,"This one I am likely being generous with my rating. I love all of the old [main] characters returning, now transplanted into a Catholic school in San Francisco, and the additional ones too... The Brothers. This was not nearly as good as the first film, but, not bad either. As her classy Las Vegas act is closing up it's run Delores is approached by her buddies from the first film to help them rein in the children. Along the way Delores makes friends, again, discovers her reluctant students have more potential than they realize and so much within her and her friends. I think that being compared to the first one is what hurt it's sequel. This one, on it's own, is a good film. When compared however it fails falling flat. There is no gun-play, no life threatening bits, no heartless bad-guy (well, not unless you count an arthritic old man who wants to close the school by any legal means available bad). The film is solid and good it is just far more lack-luster than the previous one."
1,Beware,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. First of all, it took longer to receive in the mail than it said it would and second off, it didn't even work. DO NOT RECOMEND"
3,SISTER ACT 2: BACK IN THE HABIT,"In ""Sister Act 2: Back In The Habit"", Whoopi Goldberg returns as Sister Mary Clarence. This time, she and the sisters work in a San Francisco High School to save the school from closing down by truning their music class into a chior.I never found this film to be just as funny as the first ""Sister Act"" movie. But there were a couple of great musical sequences, which ultimately saved this movie. Whoopi with the classic rock/soul medley in the opening and the kids chior singing ""Joyful Joyful"", which I found to be pretty good. I think the most important element about the second Sister Act movie was that several members of the kids chior went on to star in other movies, including Jennifer Love Hewitt and Alanna Urbach. But the most notable in the kids chior was future Fugees member and grammy award winner Lauryn Hill. Kathy Najimy, Mary Wickes, Wendy Makkena, James Coburn, Ryan Toy of the R&B; group City High and Maggie Smith also star."
4,"Good movie, but not enough of Love",I bought this today from the store and it was good. I bought it because Jennifer Love Hewitt was in it. I'm a big JLH fan! I was disappointed though that she wasn't in enough of the movie. But she had a good performance.
2,"A relentlessly simplistic, barely funny star vehicle","Though pleasant, this tailor-made sequel is annoyingly predictable and by-the-numbers. In fact, it's nothing more than a retread of all the elements of the first film with perhaps a bit more music (which doesn't help). Watch this one only if you're a die-hard fan of the original ACT or of Goldberg."
2,Part 1 was Great..Part 2 Wasnt.,SAw it in the movies.... Fell asleep midway... All the magic from part 1 which was AWESOME...was lost. Boring story... They should have left it at part 1.
2,Not Happening,This movie was not as good as the first one. It was too much of a musical. The soundtrack was good but the movie was boring and didn't keep my interst I could have been easily distracted. Whoopie should had read over the script and known that it was not an interesting one. This sequel can't hold a light to the first. The first one was kicking.
1,Why?!,"This is dreadful. Sister Act was wonderful: original, funny, and heart-warming. Sister Act 2 is appalling in every way- the teenage characters are stereotypes, most of the jokes are bad cliches, and the storyline is like a fluffy, crappo version of Dangerous Minds. Worst of all, we don't get to see much of the characters we know and love from the first film- they are shunted to the background, and Whoopi Goldberg is expected to carry the whole feature- along with her idiotic, wooden, and unrealistic class of students of course. I also find Whoopi Goldberg's character's new preachiness unconvincing and hollow. In a nutshell? Thumbs down."
4,Nice addition,"As a lover of Sister Act, it was nice to see a sequel that was decent enough not to disappoint"
5,"Whoopi,..I love you !!","I love every single movie of Whoopi, in this second part of Sister Act the young cast is just fantastic,..Lauryn Hill shows the great actress she is,the singing is outstanding, and of course the bunch of nuns getting in all kind of troubles,..so funny and entertaining."
5,Wonderful Movie,This is one of Whoopi's better pieces of work in my personal opinion. A fantastic musical delight for everyone! A Must see!
4,This movie flies,"This isn't a perfect film. The movie is full of cliches, and the ending is kinda anti-climactic, but, what's wrong with cliches if they work? This isn't for people looking for an Ingmar Bergman movie, but for people who love movies with great music. Yes, if you were under a rock when this film came out, this second Sister Act film has a killer soundtrack, which for me was better than that of the first film. The songs, especially Oh Happy Day and those songs with Lauryn Hill (her presence is electrifying) never fail to produce goosebumps. Unbelievably soulful. If you loved Fame, Flashdance, and films of the sort, this is for you. Don't listen to the critics. You'll be watching this movie over and over again and will be one of your personal favorites."
1,It is not what pedi,"It is not the product that I came to myself, which is published in the website which is not surrender, because the page claims to have subtitles in Spanish and that has not arrived, only English, greetings."
1,the effort shows here--in a really bad way!,"The first Sister Act was great--You're supposed to see the movie, to get into the characters/storyline. I did that w/the first one. Not in this second--all I saw was the effort.The basic plot is the same as the first (""saving"" the kids the way whoopi's character was ""saved""; the mafia still chasing after whoopi's character).zzzzzzz.....Enjoy the first Sister Act and be happy. (btw--the kids don't sing. They do hiphop and rapping at the end of movie. Rapping, for those who don't know the difference, is not singing. Sorry folks!)"
2,Very disappointing...,"This is such an interesting subject matter, but there are not many books about it. If you just have a curiosity about vampires, I suppose it's a good source. The writing style, however, is no better than a third grader's, and makes the reading difficult at times."
2,HORRBILE,This is an awful movie. The ONLY reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is b/c Jennifer Tilly is in it.
5,"Funny, Sad, Inspiring St Ralph","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I have watched it 3 times already, certainly one I want to have in my portfolio of movies. Perhaps, I liked it so much because it brought back memories for me when I was in an all boys high school taught by priests, but even without that memory, it was an all around good movie, acting, dialogue, and it had a little bit of everything in it, even some fantasy."
4,"Charming, Uplifting Film","A charming, feel good story about a young teen whose love for his mom drives him to strive for something that's seemingly unachievable -- winning the Boston Marathon as a 14-year old neophyte marathoner. Great acting by the entire cast, especially Adam Butcher as young Ralph Walker, who faces becoming an orphan. This film is not for everyone, and it does have some shortcomings, but, if you like feel good movies, then you'll like this one. In the end, it's a hopeful, redemptive tale that will resonate with anyone 18 or older -- and maybe even with those who are a few years younger. Worth watching more than once. The director's commentary is worthwhile. The ""making of"" feature ended too abruptly for this viewer."
4,Great movie...very pleasant surprise,"Saint Ralph is a treasure. It is an inspiring story of a young boy pursuing his miracle for the healing of his mother in a coma. His pursuit takes him on a roller coaster of emotions and experiences. It is lighthearted and also significantly inspiring. The boy's dream changes him, his community, priests and family.Unfortunately, the movie earns its PG-13 status due to some minor nudity and several references and scenes about ""abusing oneself"" Otherwise, it would be excellent for all ages. As it is, great for above 13 and adults."
5,Miracles happen all the time,"Please see Mirasreviews for a terrific synopsis. The movie's message is that God performs the miracles. We have to show Him we mean business and do what we're guided to do. This movie is perfect, and if you liked Simon Birch, you'll like this as well."
1,Saint Ralph,I adore this movie - but you can't get it for my region - Australia - sadly had to bin it
3,Interesting,"This movie may have it's dumbed down scenes and sub plots, but the message is very good. Never give up on your dreams, even if the price you may have to pay will be great. The acting is good and I have to admit, it did touch my heart."
4,"Nonsense, But Fun","Aside from the Catholicnonsense & the fact that it fictionalizes the actual event of the 1953 Boston Marathon, this is a very entertaining film - well acted, directed, etc."
4,Great movie despite some questionable scenes,"Even though it has some good values, the trials and tribulations that Ralph goes through can raise some eyebrows. For example, there is a scene where Ralph peers into the womens shower and sees a women's behind. Or when he's on the school grounds smoking.The values comes from the fact, that he is seeking a relationship with God, that he struggles with the death of his mother, and that he tries to save his mother through the miracle of winning the Boston marathon."
3,Pleasant enough little release from Canada,"'Saint Ralph' is a pleasant, poignant, small-watt charmer from Canada. In my head, I'm categorizing it together with other recent, low-budget, pleasant Canadian releases includingBollywood/Hollywood,Mambo Italiano,Touch of Pink, and the delightfully goofyFriends and Family.I felt like the film was undermined to a certain extent by Adam Butcher's lack of athleticism. At one point we're supposed to believe that Campbell Scott is timing Butcher's Ralph at well under five minutes a mile. And, indeed, I figured that part of the film would be the transformation of Butcher's ungainly, gawky stride into an elegant thing of beauty. Never happened. I never believed that fairly important part of the story for one second. That's a 9+ minute a mile stride, even at its supposed apex.Still, the film has an inherent decency and sweetness that can't be denied. It's certainly worth your time as a rental."
4,Touching,"Very good movie. Funny and heartfelt. Very well acted by the young lead, and all the other actors as well."
5,Little Known Flick - EVERYBODY Loves it!,"This is a very uplifting movie ... everyone I've shared it with loved it. This includes friends from their teens to their eighties. Many giggles; some guffaws; a few times you feel choked up with sadness. But my oh my, at the end, the good beats the crap out of the bad and you feel that there is hope for all of us."
5,Great little product!,This product arrived in great condition and is very well made. I would recommend it to others.
4,great clip,This is a great way to hold your garmin.... While hiking with a pack. Liked it so much bought one for my father.....
5,Garmin Carabiner Button Clip Works Great,Works Great! My son really likes this for his etrex GPS He uses it alot because he does hiking and climbing.
4,Good to have in the field,Good to have in the field. I can hang my Rino 530 from my pack or out of the way to save space on my belt and still keep it in hands reach.
5,You need this if you have a 60 series GPS,"I bought the 60Cx GPS and the neoprene cover for it at the same time and wrongly ""assumed"" that the cover for the 60 series was like the cover for my old Garmin eTrex. In that the cover for the eTrex had it's own clip attachment for hooking it on to your backpack. Once my order arrived I was saddened to find that there was no way to clip my GPS on to my backpack straps with out this Carabiner device.So.... I had to order this piece separately to be able to clip my GPS on to my backpack straps rather than carrying it in my pocket or something equally cumbersome. The Carabiner works well and is exactly what you need in order to be able to attach your GPS to something."
5,The First and the Best (don't let others tell you otherwise),"I bought BOY about a month ago and am still stunned by just how good this albulm really is. In fact, listening back to War and the Joshua Tree, I conclude that they never topped their debut in terms of consistency in excellence. The Joshua Tree got a little too bluesy and produced at times and some of War's funk workouts sound a little silly now. But this is pure guitar/bass/drums. ""Out of Control"", ""Electric Co."" and ""I Will Follow"" show the influence of punk(not Poison as some reviewer said!) and work wonderfully, and the other tracks have that wonderful post-punk feel without losing the optimism and getting too depressing. It's brevity also works for it, and is great from start to finish. Perhaps the best rock album of the 80s."
3,A REALLY YOUNG U2!,"Boy got the U2 classic I WILL FOLLOW, but seriously...The U2 menbers were really young and without the chops they will get in the next years...Some songs are soooooo naive that embarasses me...Well, the U2 menbers were BOYS by the time they recorded BOY..."
4,U2's Debut,"Boy is the album that introduced the Irish band to the world. The band were basically still teenagers at the time of the release and the album has that sense of urgency and earnestness that one feels at that age. This is the band's chance at the big time and they don't want to let it slip through their hands. ""I Will Follow"" is a powerful blast of rock and roll that percolates and pounds. ""Into The Heart"" is almost mystical in its delivery and ""Another Time, Another Place"" is a ripper. The album has an airy sound in places such as on ""The Ocean"", ""Twilight"" and ""The Electric Co."" while songs like ""Stories For Boys"" and ""Shadows & Tall Trees"" have an endearing naivete to them. Boy is chock full of promise and potential and the band proved they were up to the task of reaching and fulfilling that promise and potential over the course of their career."
5,post-punk album,"this album could belong to bauhaus, southern death cult, the cure with few differences (I didn't forgot bono)."
3,A must have for die hard U2 fans,"I would strongly recomend this CD to anyone who is such a diehard U2 fan such as myself. Although it does not have the catchy tunes like ""with or without you"" or ""pride"" it shows where the band started from and how they manage to change their sound with each new album."
3,Not for the casual fan,"The original Boy album is a great CD and the remastering is well done here with a lot of muddled aspects of the original cleaned up. But this deluxe 2CD set is definitely not for the casual fan and not worth the money. The second disc has only noteworthy moments. The early versions of ""Stories for boys"" and ""Out of control"" are interesting for a true U2 fan. As is the song ""Saturday night"". But ""Boy-girl"" and ""Cartoon world"" are horrible. The live version of 11 O'Clock Tick Tock is forgettable. Basically, this 2CD set offers interesting insight into the beginnings of U2. But for the casual fan, I would recommend buying the single disc, since even I, a big U2 fan, will not be throwing the second disc in the player all that often."
2,La Foto No es Lo que Ofrecen The Photo is not what They Offer,"Regards, I am little desilucionado since pense that the disc was going to come to me it was the Digipack that appears in the photo. Since my surprise is that the packing was the common one that salio in The United States that though it is true that I not tape-worm since I have the European edition was not for neda what was waiting is not definitively the product that they offer in the photo very badly.Saludos, estoy un poco desilucionado ya que pense que el disco me me iba a llegar era el Digipack que aparece en la foto. pues mi sorpresa es que el empaque era el comun que salio en Estados Unidos que si bien es cierto que yo no lo tenia ya que tengo la edicion Europea no era para neda lo que esperaba no es definitivamente el producto que ofrecen en la foto muy mal."
5,Good to go back to the old stuff,"I has all the other U2 CDs - except for this one. It was great to go back and hear the U2 ""old sound"" - very good CD."
3,U2's debut album - The Beginning,"This 1980 release of the band's first solo debut album did not immediately herald success for this band of four Irish men. This album is for fan's who are into the real early sounds and melodies of U2. The songs on this album were bland in sound but made up in the lyrical side with heavy hitting lyrics based on many current social issues that affects the world today. The great songs of this album were 'I Will Follow', 'A Day Without Me' and 'The Electric Co'. This was a CD I needed to get to complete my majestic U2 music collection - it is worth 3.5 stars out of 5."
5,"Boy, That's the Ticket","I agree with everyone else who reviewed it, but check it out, very much worth the money, geeze wish I would not have bout all the original singles etc from them but anyway, a great first album and late for work and need to cut this off, so get the CD's.Search ""Judemac forever"" on google, msn or yahoo & visit out little site."
4,No the best but a great one,"""I will follow"" is by far the best song of U2's debut album. BOY is a great sample of this band's potential. Songs like ""Out of control"" and ""Stories for boys"" sell the album as well, but the rest of BOY doesn't reach the level of these three classic hits."
4,"Early, raw energy",A must have for any fan of U2. Early stuff smelling of punk and raw energy. Breathes also of thier roots in the Christian faith. They almost kicked Bono out of the band and in this CD you might see why. But it has some great songs from when they were mere lads back in the homeland.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this for my 1 year old daughter thinking she would like pulling a little train around and popping the different characters up and down in the little cars, and learning how to stack them up. It held her attention for a few minutes and then she was finished with it. It also feels cheaply made. Wish I had spent my money on something better."
4,This is gonna be good!,"First of all, if you're a die hard fan stop reading this now because no matter what you idiots are going to buy it anyway! Second of all, every body knows that this is just releasing the same discs again in a fancy collection box! Now let's analyze the films in this collection:The Departed 4\5Great movie great acting for the most part but not always great! Must own simply because it another Scorsese mob movie!The Aviator 4\5Great movie but not the best, Mean Streets would have been a better addition!GoodFellas 6\5Best of ALL!!! Joe Pesci is a god when it comes to tough guy roles!!!It's more expensive but you should just get the Scorsese collection Vol.2 it's all of these with Mean Streets!!!"
5,The Aviator,I'm not a huge fan of The Aviator... But Goodfellas and The Departed.. Come on. Two of the best gangster movies EVER
4,Shannon Tweed?,"Goodfellas is great, The Departed is good and The Aviator is fair. But why is Shannon Tweed listed as the star? I notice she is listed as the star for a lot of movies on Amazon, and I don't think she's even in any of them."
5,A very easy to follow delightful mystery,"Some Poirot films, although very good, are somewhat difficult to follow, but not this one. Poirot moves to solve the case in a lineal, step by step fashion. A young woman asks Poirot to find out if her mother, who was hanged for poisoning her husband, the young woman's father, did so. There are five suspects who may have committed the murder, if the husband did not commit suicide, as her mother claims. Poirot interviews each of the five people, gathers information, and deduces what actually occurred from what he hears. Viewers who pay close attention to the five versions of what occurred will see the clues. Whether they do so or not, they will enjoy the tale."
3,Agatha Christie is,"a great writer, but I tend to favor some of her travel mysteries and would recommend those to anyone first meeting this author."
5,Wonderful Grinder,I first bought this grinder from QVC and I absolutely loved it. I wanted another one and I found this one here at a super great price and no S/H charges (QVC's S/H is too much). This is the absolute BEST grinder I have ever used and it doesn't make a mess on your countertop. This is a must buy if you love freshly ground spices.
2,Slow Grinder,I bought this and have used it a couple of times. It takes a lot of time and enery to grind with it and prefer to use another method that is quicker.
1,Deceiving product,"Made in China, it is hand driven. Takes a long time to grind flax seeds for example. Not easy to care for after use, not practical for kitchen use. Cuisinart has better alternatives. I returned this item."
2,No CD in sealed case,"I received this CD, sealed, yesterday. When I opened the case, there was no SACD inside - nothing!Beware when ordering this item, because I am sure the manufacturer is to blame rather than Amazon.I am unable to review the CD itself since I don't have it yet. Amazon is sending another out, so I am pleased with their customer service."
4,Good purchase,This item was good for the price paid but the case was a little rougher than i thought it would be. Still a good bargain and plays very well
2,Insulting to Conservatives and Christians,"Having read and enjoyed the first Barbara Holloway book, I was looking forward to the continuing story....but now that I'm reading it, I am not sure I will be able to finish. Wilhelm takes many opportunities to make people with my viewpoint look like backward idiots intent on destroying others. When reading any book, I can overlook little blurbs that authors insert that are offensive to me, but this takes it to a new level, as there are long diatribes trashing Christians and conservatives. Fortunately, I checked this book out of the library so I haven't lost any money in the process of learning what I can expect from Ms. Wilhelm's books. It's a shame that such a talented author chose to insult a substantial segment of the population in this way."
2,"Fast paced drama, except for near trial end","The book begins well, rich (or at least well off, but playing at being poor) female lawyer is asked to do the impossible, free a woman pre-judged to be a baby killer. Barbara (the lawyer) does a credible job and succeeds. The book bogs down near the end with a lot of shooting off in all directions apparently trying to explain herself. 'Bad guys' are unbelievably bad: making money on abortion formula while mouthing abortion foe rhetoric. A little too overdramatic...a C-minus for such a lack of sublety. The righteous are 'good-good', the other side is 'bad bad'. Author is no John Grisham."
4,Well Worth Your Time And Money!,"Brian Haig (son of Alexander Haig) is a fresh new ""voice"" in popular fiction. His style of writing -- part witty, part sarcastic and always interesting -- makes Secret Sanction a book to put near the top of your ""To Be Read"" list. I think you'll be captivated by the story (which moves along at a very crisp pace), the characters ( which are believable and multi-dimensional), and Haig's knowledge of military honor, tradition and politics. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to Haig's first effort. There's no doubt in my mind that you'll like Secret Sanction a lot and be looking forward to Haig's next book. The only reason I didn't rate the book a ""5"" is that I anticipated the ending a little too far in advance of where I would have liked, since the earlier reviews I read on Amazon led me to believe the ending was a major surprise. However, the actual rating level here is not really that relevant. What is relevant is that this is a book you'll be glad to read."
2,"Interesting plot, but VERY poorly researched","While Haig weaves an interesting tale, his writing demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge about international law, military justice, criminal law, and the Army in general. As an Army Judge Advocate myself, I have to suspend disbelief to a certain extent, but I do expect authors to do enough research that basic principles remain intact. For example, no Army officer would EVER say ""OORAH"" or ""HOORAH"" when referring to the 82d Airborne. ""Proximate cause"" doesn't get you a search authorization anywhere--PROBABLE cause does. Military suspects being interrogated by CID would know what crimes they are suspected of because of Article 31, UCMJ. And the list goes on (and on, and on). The predictable plot I can forgive; the rest I cannot. Please do not read this book thinking you are getting an accurate insight into the world of military law."
5,Unputdownable!,"Secret Sanction captured my attention on page one and never let go. I thoroughly enjoyed all of the characters Haig has created. All were very well developed and very believable. Major Sean Drummond has a biting sense of sarcasm and quick wit that makes the lead character come alive. I will not divulge any more of the story than has already been by other reviewers, however I will say that you will find that there are more layers to this cover up than you would ever imagine.This is a must read in my book!!Can wait for Brian Haig's next offering. Keep'em coming Mr.. Haig."
5,Great First Book,"After seeing Brian Haig interviewed on Larry King, along with another first time author, Georgia Durante, I decided to purchase both books. Being an avid reader, I was pleasantly surprised by both books, Mr. Haig's being fiction and Ms. Durante's, non fiction. These two books kept me captivated for 4 days. A reader's delight! Couldn't put them down. Larry King must screen his author's well to come up with such fasinating stories. I will never hesitate buying a book that Larry tauts on his show. Do yourself a favor and pick up both ""Secret Sanction"" and ""The Company She Keeps."" You won't be disappointed."
4,Great lead character,"Secret Sanction is Brian Haig's first book. It introduces us to lawyer/spec ops operator/smartass Sean Drummond. Haig's first person narative is what makes this book so great. In a massive military cover-up Drummond must fight to find out the truth, and maybe even to protect his own life..."
4,Not worth being too critical,"This book is like a summer thriller movie: you can pick apart the plot 9 ways to Sunday, but when it is all said and done, you realize that you've been entertained. Considering this is Haig's first book, I'm willing to give him a lot of latitude and only wish that I could put forth such a first effort. The book was enjoyable, the main character was likable, the plot was basically plausible and, frankly, I couldn't put it down the last 200 pages. I look forward to Mr. Haig's future offerings and I only hope he continues his main characters in the mold of Sean Drummond."
2,Good reading - poor moral message,Enjoyable reading but very turned off by conclusion that it is ok for a soldier to commit atrocities under the guise of punishing the bad guys. I like Haig's books but am very disappointed in his moral message.
5,secret sanction,"Read it, love it, wait for the next page, then wait for the ending you'll never figure out and then wait for his next BOOK.It's that good"
5,"A ""MUST HAVE"" for all women - keep it as a desk reference.","This book is on my desk at home and work for reference as is any dictionary or thesaurus. Every woman I know has experienced a ""LOW"" a ""VALLEY"". This book helps you identify with those ""lows"" those ""valleys"" that you are going through - have been through and coming out of. The author encourages you to connect with ""Your"" higher power to walk by faith out of those valleys. I will read this book again and again! Thank you Sister Vanzant for your encouragement!"
5,POWERFUL BOOK!!!,"Iyanla Vanzant is a talented and inspiring sister. I can't thank her enough for sharing her gift. This book is a serious guide to dealing with every situation that exists and now the prospect of being in the valley is not frightening because I can see my way out. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!"
4,Singing the messages loud and clear straight to you,"The messages hit home to me in this book and I am Caucasian. I need to retread it a few time to let all these wonderful messages sink in,it's definitely a book I will keep close."
5,Love Iyanla,"Iyanla is such an inspiring gifted person. God is really using her in a tremendous way, her books have helped me a whole lot. Giving a real reality check!"
5,I Finally looked at myself instead of others..,I have never understood myself more than I ever had until I read this book. I recommend that every woman read this book. I am a young woman trying to find myself and this book put me on the right path. I have learned so much about myself thanks to this book.
5,THIS IS A VERY GOOD AND INSPIRATIONAL BOOK,IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SPIRTUAL AND EMOTIONAL UPLIFT THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU. THIS BOOK TAUGHT ME HOW TO LOVE AGAIN AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF AND MY JOB I HAVE.
5,One of my favorite bands,"Promize as a band is where it is at... 'Fumbling Gracefully', 'Are you here' and 'Fly' are in my Amazon Cloud and playing with my select playlist..."
2,This is Guy Claxton on a really lazy day.,"I read several of Guy Claxton books. I typically love them. But, not this one. He is an original, insightful, contrarian, brilliant type of thinker on cognitive science. But, not here. I don't think he defines Buddhism well. And, does not provide the reader with much to work on or understand, unlike most of his other books."
2,NOISY!,"This fan works ok, and moves a lot of air, but it so awfully noisy, that I really hate to use it when I am home. I do turn it on in the RV when I have to leave my dogs for any length of time, in case there is a power outage and the air conditioner quits, because it runs on the coach batteries.Unfortunately the clip broke when it fell from the place I had it clipped to."
4,For the beginner,This book takes you through the basic understandings of interpreting schematic circuitry. It ends with a few block diagrams and how they can be interpreted and put into place in a component setup. Worth a read.
3,A book for electronic professionals,"It's not a book for graphic designers, infographic artists or journalist. It's a book about electronic schematics."
1,Didn't help at all,This book was more about symbols and looking them up and not about actually explaining the flow of electricity through circuits. Anybody can look up symbols in a legend and find out what they are and surely we don't need a whole book about it. However getting use to reading the way electricity flows through various circuits and devices can get pretty confusing and this book did very little to help clear up that. That's what I call reading circuits. I thought this book would have various example circuits of increasing complexity and trace the path of current flow through each one and explain some of the anomalies we might encounter. Thumbs down on this one.
1,"Waste of money, waste of time.","I was expecting something completely different. The story between the two guys was not interesting, both guys are feminine and neither of them are attractive. Save your money. If you're looking for romance or a good story, there's lots of other titles to choose from. If you're looking for porn, you can find free stuff on the internet much better."
3,Not Too Bad,"This film was ok. I saw it once and probably would not watch it again. It is primarily a interview juxtaposed with clips of a sex scene. This is not porn, but the final scene is pretty hot."
1,A lousy film,"Foolishly, I'd expected something better when I purchsed this film. Sadly, it is a self indulgent, tedious bore. The astonishing arrogance of the participants to think that anybody would want to watch them in action, over and over again. Cute and interesting they ain't!"
2,Cheap thrill!,Did not enjoy the DVD. Not into cheap thrills. No story line and heard the same story over and over. It gives the feel of two friend telling their story on home video. Poor.
4,A refreshing perspective,"This modest documentary on real-life adult stars Damon & Hunter left me wanting to know even more about them. It was refreshing to catch their takes on love, sex, backgrounds, how they met, etc., and treat them as real people, not just fantasy figures paid to hit their marks on film.The actual sex at the end is genuinely sweet & passionate, but it's the affectionate vibes between Damon & Hunter during the interview segments that somehow stoke the fire. These are two appealing & heartfelt young men, and I wish them all the best in their life together."
1,"Only for the installation, not for the system configuration","The book does cover some details on Linux configuration : both the text-based approach and using the new GUI-based installation program. If for a end usr just using linux for personal use, it would be a good book. However, if you try to find out how to setup DNS, NIS, Firwall and set up a Apache web server on Red Hat Linux 6.1, it doesn't tell you any. So if you are a system administrator and try to learn how to set up your Linux as a server, I would not recommend buying this book."
5,Lazy Afternoon,"There are afternoons that I relax with this CD and am transported to Paris on a spring day. Francine Roche's voice can take away all the stresses of the world (especially with her rendition of ""La Vie en Rose"") and send you to a relaxing, wonderful foreign land. This CD is wonderful."
2,Did not work correctly,"I am a bit of a fan of the chipmunks and I was glad that I could see episodes that where not on DVD yet. Sadly the video quality was poor on the video I got, my guess is because how old the video is. The good news is that I think one of the episodes is now on DVD and the other one will come out the end of this month. I would not recommend this purchase, just wait for the DVDs."
4,a good addition to one's collection for a pshat rendering,"There can be no Answer without a Question. So opens the Malbim Haggadah. With over 300 pages, it contains a Traditional Right to Left haggadah, compiled by Rabbi Taub of Mercaz ha Torah and Ohr Yerushalayim in Israel. It is a straightforward reading of the seder text with analysis. Also known as the Medrash Haggadah. The book opens with an overview analysis essay (Maama Yesod Musad) from 1894 of the ""secret structure"" of the seder. It is a good addition to anyone's collection of haggadahs, and is a good reference for the seder leader or anyone who wishes to expound upon the ideas presented during the seder. It includes the Hebrew seder, with an English translation. Most of the pages are filled with pshat commentaries on the words and ideas of the seder paragraphs. For example, The FOUR QUESTIONS are in Hebrew, and faced with an English translation, and surrounded by seven pages of commentary on them."
4,BOOOOM! The Gas is Gone.,Thats all I have to say. My dog was gassy so I needed some relief. The beneficial dog food was bloating him up. So I bought this stuff and BOOOM! No more gas. It works. It really works. It actually works so well my wife might make me use it :) jking
2,"Good idea, but VERY poorly made.","Yes, plain and simple, my daughter LOVES this toy, but she is 3 and doesn't know the meaning of the word ""quality"". This toy has none, just like anything else made in China. It's a good idea, but I would gladly pay five, or even ten times the price for a quality toy made in US or even in China."
4,"good ""Batman"" variation","Dick Tracy is patterned very similarly to 1990's Batman. The biggest similarity is the music score, which could almost be considered a total ripoff of Danny Elfman's soundtrack. However, I think this movie is a lot better. The songs are cool 1930'sish numbers. I really loved all of the ""madeup"" gangsters in this movie when I was a kid. Some of them actually appear pretty grotesque, especially the guys who get shot playing cards at the first of the movie. Their makeup makes them look like they have acne scars. I don't know if this is a flaw or if it was done on purpose. There is a classic shootout scene at the end that you'll probably watch over and over (its the best part of the whole movie). Recommended."
3,Almost Excellent,"This film comes together much better than I expected. I think that Warren Beatty, an otherwise terrific actor, lacks something as Dick Tracy. He's too sober. I once read that someone thought Bruce Willis would have been perfect as Tracy. I think that that casting would have made this film a classic....a missed opportunity. I still recommend it as great fun."
2,Slow Service,"DVD was great but service company was very slow getting it to me. Overall DVD worked very well, delivery just sucked."
3,Tracy! Tracy! Tracy!,"It's funny. It's romatic. It's exciting. What more could you want from a film? Well I'll tell you, this movie should of had profanity, blood, and especiall full nudity for an action to make it more adult. Why I say those things cause for this suppose to be a kids movie it had a lot of machine guns people getting shot at and kill on the scean not one time was their any blood flesh on their body, gambling, drinking, smoking, and a little risque humor from Madonna coming on to Dick Tracy played by (Warren Beatty) and the way she was dress is a slight revealing. Al Pacino played an awesome part on being Big Boy he stole the show."
2,"A classic charecter wasted by beatty, just wasted","This movie is worth watching but has no visual key, all the original charecter seem to feed of Warren Beatty's every move, it did make me think alot and the dark nature of this shatteringly wasted movie will confuse you into a point that you will totally hate it, no main plot and a small appearence from Maddonna, if this movie had been directed by James Camaron or Spyke Jonzes, it would've been a major success, too bad the great charecter has been entirely ruined, no hope for a sequel just comes to show you how this disastorious movie hit the point of no fame."
4,Soylent Dick Says: Great Movie & Great Entertainment!!!,"A delightful movie! Great use of colour, and very amusing presentation of the various figures as caracatures. The portrayal of some of the crims, (eg mumbles, pruneface, etc) of other characters such as Breathless Mahony (Madonna), the Kid, and Tess Trueheart is priceless.An above-average movie and great entertainment."
5,Hell of a Comic Strip Adaptation,"I don't know what it is I like about this movie, but I remember as a kid how terrified by the villains I was. Now that I'm older I see who, they're hideous characters that stand out from the rest of us by their physical deformities. Their actions make them monsters, and true to form they look like monsters. And then there's Dick Tracy in his iconic yellow getup spouting things like ""the bad men are scaring me.....take them away."" He's the last line of defense against these crooks, and you GET that throughout the movie.And the adult themes are aplenty, so I am glad that this movie was made for the baby boomers who grew up with the comic and not for a new generation that likes to humanize the villain. And holy crap, Madonna is in this picture and there isn't a single cover song or cameo-esque feel....well done. She had the femme fatale role down perfectly.This is the widescreen DVD format."
5,Dick Tracy,"Legendary police detective Dick Tracy is the only man tough enough to take on gangster boss Big Boy Caprice and his band of menacing mobsters. Dedicated to his work but at the same time devoted to his loyal girlfriend, Tess Trueheart, Tracy find himself torn between love and duty. His relentless crusade against crime becomes even more difficult when he gets saddled with an engaging orphan and meets seductive and sultry Breathless Mahoney, a torch singer determined to get the best of Tracy. A faceless character, known as the Blank, threatens both Tracy and Big Boy, and it takes all of Tracy's skills to save the city. This is a fun movie, a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly colorful fashion like nothing you have ever seen. This is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book, from style to eccentricity."
1,Severely scratched,"THe DVD stopped about halfway through, which I know happens sometimes. I tried skipping backwards and then forwards in order to ""jump"" the damaged area but nothing happened. When I looked at the back of the disc I noticed a very larger, very deep scratch. I hadn't bothered to check before loading the disc since I figured that a brand new DVD right out of the package wouldn't have any damage. I've tried everything I can think of to repair, resurface, or get the laser to continue reading the undamaged parts of the disc but I guess the damage is just too bad.This is probably the 3rd or 4th DVD i've bought off of Amazon recently that has been damaged right out of teh package."
4,Good comic series flick,Dick Tracy(Beatty) is a tough detective in a 40's Us major city.This stilish Chester Gould comic strip adaptation with bright colors and wardoble and also good make up effects is fun to watch from beginning to end.With a comic and overmaked up Big Boy Caprice(Pacino) a ruthless gangster who wants to control the city and a perfect singer blonde bombshell Breathless Mahoney(Madonna) who wants Tracy and also Caprice from them and she has her own plans t orule the city disguished as a unmasked man with gutural voice.A very good flick.
2,Shame on Touchstone,"I gave this product only 2 stars. I have to explain. In this particular case I decided to rate the PRODUCT and NOT the film. The film certinaly deserves the ""essential video"" designation that AMAZON has bestowed on it. What gets my goat is how Touchstone (aka Disney) can release a film like this on DVD without even a hint of some behind the scenes footage/interviews, or even the trailer! And on top of that they are charging [too much] for it! There are dvd's out there that cost [less] that have better presentations than this!"
5,Dick Tracy,"I enjoyed this very much. The characters were a hoot! The coloring was fantastic. Madonna's part was wonderful. The kid was great. My favorite line was when Tess asked the kid who took care of him and he said with a mouth full of food, ""Who takes care of you?"""
3,Almost perfect,"Was able to watch most of the movie near the middle there was something wrong with it had to use fast forward the get movie to play again. Sad, it seemed like a new movie ...obviously not since its defective."
3,not bad,The movie was all-an-all good makeup was great but speaking from a fan of Madonna's she should have had more screen time.The ending should have not ended that way?
4,It's a Good Movie but not Great Movie!,I just got done with watching this movie. Wow! I thought this movie was done well. I really think it would be cool if this movie could be remade. I'm going to work on remaking this movie.
1,A Sure Fire Cure For Insomnia,When one can honestly say that the best thing in a movie is Madonna... one is saying all that need be said.
3,haha hoffman,dustin hoffman played a retarded person in rain man and this movie. people must not think too highly of him.
3,Doesn't do justice to Gould's creation,While the movie is visially great the writers seemed to have forgotten that it was not just the appearance of Gould's villans that made them famous and interesting but their character traits as well. Adding to this problem is that seemingly every famous villain Gould created between 1938-1949 is in the picture. So not only do you have way too many characters to flesh out properly but for them to fit the story many of the character traits and professions Gould gave them in the strip had to be removed or changed.The irony here is because of this the LESS you know of Gould's actual creations the more you will enjoy the picture. Conversely if you are a die hard Tracy fan who knows Gould's villains inside and out this film is very disappointing.
4,Great entertainment despite a weak plot.,"I had just graduated from high school when this film first came out so it brings back some great memories. Though the plot is weak, this movie must be seen for its entertainment value: great use of color, fantastic music, and outrageous characters! If you're looking for a silver-screen marvel, stay away. If you're looking for a great hero, you're better off at the comic book store checking out Superman or whatever. But, if you want to enjoy an entertaining movie with a bag of hot popcorn, this is a good choice! And you can't beat Madonna!"
4,Madonna saved the otherwise choppy film.,"Well, I was at first put off by the overly cartoon-y ccolors of the sets and characters--that is, until Madonna appeared onscreen in all her luminescent radience (which made the coloring much more bearable). The musical score was a perfect match, and Beatty was at his most charming, but Tess trueheart's character was very boring (how Tracy could have chosen her over Madonna's radient Breathless Mahoney is a true mystery to me. Mandy Patinkin was also good as Breathless's accomplice and piano player. This film is worth having just to view Madonna in all her splendor--and her acting isn't bad either (much better than seeing her in ""Shanghai Surprise"" She reminded me of La Monroe in ""Niagra"" as Rose Loomis. As an extra bonus, this film is very family-freindly--that is, you can watch it with your kids with a clear conscience, since there is nothing offensive to worry about."
5,"""Calling Dick Tracy . . .""","You've got to own this movie. It is stripped from the comic strips from the funny pages and brought directly to you. In this adventure, not only does tracy have to figure a way to balance his work and love life but he's trying not to get a desk job, fight a growing mob of all the misfits he's taken down countless times before, and even had time to take in a small homeless boy. It's a busy day in the city of lights. Al Pacino also plays a pivital role in this feature. What this movie is is classic flim noir city. Sin City would go along great with this movie and you could have a film noir marathon in your own entertainment center. Enjoy!"
4,"Please Touchstone Video, release soon ""Dick Tracy (Special Edition)""","Touchstone Home Video should release soon on DVD ""Dick Tracy (Special Edition)"" in which they could include the following features:The documentary ""Dick Tracy: Behind the Badge, Behind the Scenes""Theatrical Trailer(s) and TV Spot(s)Theatrical and Video Poster(s)Production Photo GalleryDeleted ScenesAudio Commentary with Director WARREN BEATTYMusical score by DANNY ELFMAN on a seperate audio channelAvailable Subtitles and Audio Tracks in: English, Spanish, French"
3,"Pacino was great, Beatty was not.","This was a fun movie, with many similarities to a comic strip, such as the villians and the colors, but I don't think that Warren Beatty could have possibly been worse. He was so cheesy in it, and granted, it's a rather un-serious movie, but man was he bad! Al Pacino was great though and even received an oscar nomination for this one. Madonna was more attractive in this role than any others she has taken on (A League of their Own, Evita), and Dustin Hoffman's tiny role as Mumbles was fascinating. Obviously don't see this movie expecting to see reality. The backgrounds were extremely fake, as well as Beatty's acting. It's fun to watch though. The PG rating was surprisingly too mild for this film. There is a substatial amount of (nongraphic) violence and even some sexual innuendo. It was fun though."
5,BWV 21 Best recording available,"I have owned dozens of CDs with the BWV 21 Cantata, and this unassuming looking CD has by far the best choral treatment. The choirboy alto is marvellous, especially in the aria Seufzer Tranen Kummer Not. This part was written for a boy to sing, not a woman. And after listening to many operatic, stilted performances of this piece, with women soloists, the real jewel of them all is this recording. It is hard to believe something this perfect was originally part of a low-price set. The other recordings on this CD are excellent too, but listen to the Seufzer Tranen Kummer Not. WOW!!!"
2,"Soft material, poor design","I like the handles; they seem to fit my baby's hand just fine. I also like the colors but the valve falls out only to suddenly hear your baby trying to gulp down large amounts of water. And you have to screw in the lid just so as to align the spout with the handles, othewise the baby will not get a tight seal on his/her mouth and won't be able to drink. I like the Playtex trainer cups better."
2,disappointing,"I always think that Gerber sippies should be to perfect - they've been in the business a long time. This cup is fine, except that the valve falls out all too easily. And, really, the valve is the whole point. Other Gerber sippy designs with the same valve have given us the same trouble. For sippies, I go with Playtex."
2,Just don't like it,"After losing one of our Gerber Sip n smile cups (which we love), I bought one of these to replace it. Boy was that a mistake! The spout is way harder and although it is possible, it is extremely difficult to line up the spout and handles properly. My son won't even drink from it. Oh, and it can leak. Waste of money. Go for the sip n smile cups. They're awesome for young babies."
3,Where to begin . . .,"When we got these cups and started using them they were great. Since we've owned them, the valves have withstood teething and tossing with only two instances where the spill-proof valve has slipped free causing a leak (unfortunately once was in my truck with Sprite - son was sick and doc recommended that time only - and it got ALL over the place). They're great little cups except for one problem I have with them. I stopped hand washing when we packed all the bottles away. So, the cups go in the dishwasher, now. Not a big problem except for where the handles attach to the cup at the bottom. Any loose food particles in the dishwasher inevitably land inside this part of the cup and I have to manipulate the cup later to rinse those things out. I know it's not inside the cup, but it just looks disgusting! Yuck! Great cup, Gerber, now can we work on the bottom?!"
1,Spill-proof???,"That's certainly a misnomer. This was the first sippy cup we purchased for my son. The little device that is supposed to make the cup spill-proof would always slip out, causing the cup to leak. The design of this cup looks cool, and Gerber is a reputable name in the baby-product industry, so I thought I was getting a quality product when I laid my money down for the 6oz Gerber ""Spill-Proof"" Cup. I was wrong.There are plenty of sippy cup options out there, and your kid is bound to go through quite a few of them during their sippy-cup days. Gerber makes plenty of other sippy cups with a sturdier design. Personally I prefer their sport cups...that one has held up the longest in our house."
3,"Not a good first cup, but save for later!","I bought these for my son as his first sippy cup (around 8 months). He had trouble in part because when you screwed the lid on, the mouthpiece never centered when holding it by the handles. First I thought he wasn't getting the hang of cup drinking, then I switched to a handle free sippy and problem solved! I brought these out again after a few months practice and he uses them just fine (at 1 year old)."
5,Counting Rhymes,"This is a very fun, simple counting rhyme book. Mostly counting animals and one little Indian boy."
5,Old aunts and young kids,"This is such a great book that when I sent one to my aunt about four years ago, she promptly purchased seven copies for her friends for Christmas. My aunt is in her 60's.Oddly enough, my kids loved this book, too. Becker probably didn't set out to write a devotional book per se, but With New Eyes worked great as one. I read a chapter per night until we'd finished the book. When I forgot to read from it one night, my 9-year-old said, ""Get New Eyes, Mom."""
1,DO NOT BUY,"This book is filled with errors!! The questions are elementary, when compared to the real GMAT test. The CD will give test takers a higher score than they are really scoring. Please do not purchase this book if you are interested in raising your score. It should be taken off the shelves."
3,Not a must for GMAT,verbal section is not good at all. It looks pretty easy as compared to actual verbal on GMAT. Math is same level as GMAT. I would say it is not a must buy for people who want to score high on GMAT.if they update the book and include 4 comprehension and a little harder Critial reasoning question then it will become a good book RIght now no.
3,Minimum needed to pass,"Having only three weeks to study for GMAT, purchased this book without researching other study aids. I liked the fact that there were 6 practice tests, and feel I received a fair enough sampling of question types (except for multiple-multiple answers in the quantitative section, such as A= I and II, B= II and III, etc.).However, there are some errors in the book. I too tried to look on-line for errata information, and found none. Other people praise Nova's Gmat Prep Course (Paperback) by Jeff Kolby. Good luck."
2,Renal Essentials vs. Azodyl,"Our sweet little part-pom. was rescued with a variety of health issues. I tried substituting Renal Essentials for the Azody she's been on, but it just didn't work for her. After a week on Renal Essentials she was having a great deal of difficulty urinating. She's back on Azodyl and back to normal renal function. Sorry it didn't work for us!"
2,Not for my little Yorkie,I purchase this product trying something different than the other product that I have been using. The little guy's system would not tolerate this formula. I went back to the other product I was using.
3,great for my dad,my dad loves these old movies. Three in one for christmas. Perfect gift for him and other old movie buffs
1,Just Poor,"Spy Hard is the worst spoof I have ever seen. Most of the jokes in it are stolen right out of other, much better spoofs like Airplane and Hotshots and yet, they still can't manage to be funny. I laugh like mad every time I hear the "" A hospital, what is it?"" joke in Airplane and I didn't even smirk when the used THE EXACT SAME JOKE in this movie! To make things worse, the original jokes in this film are just as bad, if not worse. Spy Hard's spoofs are pointless. In the middel of the movie, for no apparant reason, they do the Pulp Fiction dance. Why? Spoofing other movies is only funny when its somehow tied into the plot. This film should be avoided at all costs. It just isnt funny."
2,Leslie Neilsen Better Spy Harder,"In Spy Hard the Bond spoof half of the movie isn't really spoofing James Bond. They spoof Pulp Fiction poorly, the True Lies spoof is lame, and the Home Alone spoof is so bad. They just found some cheesy look alike of Macally Caulkin. I found it funny when they had the beginning part of the film where Weird Al Yankovic sang the theme song. He head really didn't have to blow up. Spy Hard is a poor film and just like the slapstick of other Neilsen films."
4,Leslie Nielsen plays James Bond? Kinda ...,"This is my kind of comedy movie! I've seen this movie about 10 times and carry it on my laptop for travel. Simply said, it is a parity of the 007 movies. Plenty of stupid puns, sight-gags, and really bad jokes. I am a big fan of Leslie Nielsen and he play the Bond-like lead role."
3,aight,"this was aigtg movie, idk , i liked it more when i was younger, the jokes get pretty weird sometimes, it isnt as good as THe Naked Gun series.."
3,"If you're gonna spy, then you have to SpyHard.",I saw it on starzs acouple months ago. My Jordan told me about it when he saw it in the theartes. I thought that was funny escpiesly when weird-al Yanchovich was singing the theme. I wish they made a game.
4,"The movie was so funny, soda gushed out of my nose.","A funny movie with a great cast. It was well directed.It keeps you laughing (I mean laughfing hard). It was one of the best written comedies I,ve ever seen. Leslie Neilson was definetly at his best."
2,MY GRADE: C plus to B minus,A goofy movie that I wouldn't have watched all the way through if I wasn't drugged up on Nyquil. There are some funny chuckles in this film but no rip roaring laughs. Seemed like an attempt to imitate the NAKED GUN series but was watered down. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus to B minus; HUMOR: C to C plus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus.; WHEN WATCHED: end of February 2012 (streamed)
3,Not Enhanced for Widescreen TVs,"You can read the other reviews to get a good idea about this movie. It is rated PG-13 ""For Crude Humor and Sexual Innuendo"", you have been warned. My main issue is that this DVD is not enhanced for widescreen TVs -- that is, the video is encoded at a 4:3 aspect ratio with black bars at the top and bottom, which will cause black bars all around the image."
3,"""Leave me alone, I'm and unarmed man""","Andy Griffith saves what little there is to this unabashed spy spoof. You may remember Andy in several TV series as Mayberry R.F.D. and Matlock. Andy playing General Rancor in this film is spoofing General Midwinter (Ed Begley) in ""Billion Dollar Brain"" (1967).The standard story is General Rancor will destroy the world once he gets his computer chip the same chip that cannot be destroyed as it can cure world hunger. Of course, there is an imprisoned father scientist being sought by an overtly sexy daughter who incorporates the help of WD-40, a slippery agent.Top Secret!"
1,Not like Naked Gun,"This was a very poor movie.You would think with leslie neilsen in it,it would be like The Naked Gun movies, but don't be fooled.the only good part of the movie is the beggining theme with ""Weird Al"" Yankovic.I would not recomend this to anybody."
1,"very, very bad","Sigh...the previous reviewer should have watched the movie before reviewing it. You think ""ah! A farce with Leslie Nielson! It must be funny!"" based on The Naked Gun. Don't be fooled, though: this isn't an Abraham, Zucker & Zucker production, and it's not at all funny. Some tips for the writer: sexual innuendo in itself is not funny. It's only funny if there's something CLEVER about it. The same with movie references: you can't just ape an older film; you have to actually do something FUNNY with it. Nielson IS a naturally funny guy, I think, but even he cannot redeem this waste of celluloid. The only redeeming quality of Spy Hard is Weird Al Yankovic singing the opening theme, but it's just not enough."
2,You're not missing much,"I wouldn't say this movie is horrible as much as it just was not funny. Sure, the back cover says it's hilarious, but I can't say I was busting a gut over any moment in the entire film. The variety of other films parodied was interesting, and I thought Weird Al singing the intro music was pretty cool (and his subsequent cranial explosion). I giggled at a couple things here and there, but I wouldn't watch this movie again. I think the plot and the silliness would have been better as an animated cartoon film.Meanwhile, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery made its debut the following year and showed the right way to make a funny spy movie. Spy Hard is kind of like the special needs, watered-down, family-friendly, bubble-wrapped love child of Austin Powers and Looney Tunes. If that's what you like in a film, then this movie may well be visionary to you, but I personally didn't think it was funny at all, let alone as funny as the box claimed it would be."
4,Great info - pictures could be sharper,Great info - pictures could be sharper. Overall a good deal for the fanatic who wants to get through the game!
1,Nestor Keeps Wasting His Talent,"As long as artists keep making albums with only one good song, people will keep getting them for free in internet. Nestor keeps insisting in doing instrumental hip hop, pop, commercial, elevator music. If you like that kind of music, buy this CD, otherwise buy Hubert Laws, or Dave Valentin among others. If you want to listen to good Nestor music, buy ""Morning Ride"", ""Dance Of The Phoenix"", ""Talk To Me"", ""Mi Alma Latina"" or the charanga album "" Mis Canciones Primeras"". Sorry Nestor, I am a big fan of your music but you are wasting your talent doing this kind of stuff. When do you plan to make a good non commercial latin jazz album?"
4,Inspired Music,"This CD is my first experience with Nestor Torres' music. I found it to be a beautiful, gentle, collection of flute tunes, but not boring at all. It is clear that Mr Torres was spiritually inspired to create this music, but he is also an excellent musician, so the music isn't easy listening music. It contains interesting melodies and some unusual vocal and instrumental accompaniment. I will certainly be looking for more of this talented flutist's music now that I've heard this CD."
1,Doesn't work with Sunfire,"When installed in a Pontiac Sunfire there is almost no room between the front of the bracket and the door panel. I couldn't find a decent speaker that would fit. 6 1/2"" speakers don't even fit in the adapter at all. I had to cut an inch off with a rotary saw but was determined to get it in as I already had brought the speakers.Unless you are adept with a saw I wouldn't bother."
2,Does not fit,"Although this product is described as being for ""1995-up"" Pontiac Sunfires, this is patently not the case. When installed in a 1998 Pontiac Sunfire, not only are the included screws just barely large enough not to pull through the holes, but worse, the door panel impacts the speaker face fully an inch before the clips that hold the panel onto the door make it to the holes that receive them.In order to make this product work, I needed to cut out the entire inner speaker grille from the door panel, and glue the outer speaker grille back in at an angle to cover the speaker.I used this product with a pair of Pioneer TS-G1643R 6.5-Inch 2-Way Speakers, and did not use the speaker grille included with the speakers."
3,Nothing really special,I bought this hoping it would make a real differences. I took the product as directed and I passed a lot of weird stuff but I didn't feel like it made much of a different. I'm sure this is helpful but not what I was expecting.
4,Gentle but effective cleanser,"I've used this product several times. The package contains enough capsules for a month. It cleans out toxins from your body and you will lose weight; it makes you ""regular"" but you don't have to worry about going outside and staying near toilets as you do with other cleansers. Highly recommended."
1,super constipation,"I ordered this item because I could get it included with the free super saver shipping. Also, I generally like yerba prima products. This one, however, really plugged me up. After the 1st week of the ""gentle"" cleanse I was constipated so I decided to apply the heavier cleanse(doubleing the dose). This really plugged me up so after another 7-8 days or so I threw the remainder of the capsules out and went back to the psyllium husks + colon care formula and was regular in 2-3 days. This may work for some people but not for me!"
3,Not as good as Johnny Hartman,"I do enjoy Mr Eckstein's vocals if not the vibrato. Not at all to my taste. Also his choice of material/arrangement was rather bland.Can I suggest a far superior voice, Johnny Hartman - he who found fame with John Coltrane in 1963.Mr Hartman just sang smooth baritone less the vibrato. He made several albums in the 1950's and 1960's that are just unbeaten in quality of voice and material.Do a google search and check him out.Mr B's version of ""Ask the lonely"" ""It's All In The Game"" also made famous by Levi Stubbs shows how lacking in vocal quality was Mr Eckstein."
5,Much-needed history,"There has been a need for an authoritative history of the software industry, and this book fills the gap. It is entertaining and gives an excellent account of the origins and development of the various sectors of the industry. Its focus is wholly on the United States, a decision for which the author gives full justification, but despite my interest in the UK software industry I still found the book fascinating and illuminating. It provides an important corrective to a number of myths, from the Software Crisis to the dominance of Microsoft, and offers plenty of evidence in support of its analysis. There are entertaining illustrations at the beginning of each chapter. As a university lecturer, I shall certainly be using this book extensively and referring my students to it."
5,Works well for Kumbucha!,This water dispenser works really well for Kumbucha. It is the perfect height for fitting under the cabinet. It comes with a ring for sitting over the muslin. I am very happy with this product.
2,Leaking in less than a week,"The dispenser developed a leak due to a crack in the bottom of the unit in less than a week. Although it looks nice and seems to work okay other than the leak, buyer beware."
1,Water all over kitchen,"The first day I set it up, I returned home after dinner to find the water bottle empty and my kitchen floor full of water. The water seemed to be coming from the top of the crock, rather than the bottom...like the water bottle did not stop dispensing after it filled the crock. I don't know what went wrong."
5,"Real, yet surreal. My favorite pick out of hundreds.","I felt that this story illustrated creative thematic continuity. The plot is precisely orchestrated. The symbolism is clear and allegoric. Both Old and New Testament allusions flow between the lines. The theme is intense and unified. The setting is literal, yet transcends figurative meanings.The narrator's point of view is dramatic. The theme is both illustrative and moving. The style is connotative of much deeper meanings. The diction is creatively suggestive. The characters are plausible and consistent.I think this is a masterpiece! The conclusion is strong and symbolic. Throughout the story, Roth saturates and consistently reinforces his theme in a satire of religious hypocrisy. I give you ten stars for this one! **********Patty Stroe"
3,Great performances - Lousy video,Really too bad that such wonderful performances are so difficult to appreciate because of the way this was filmed. It's like having a really bad seat for a great show. Difficult to hear/follow much of the dialog . . . difficult to avoid being distracted by antics of audience members---visible in lots of shots. Can't recommend.
5,The album that started it all.........,"Keith Sweat's ""Make it last forever"" may have come out in 1987, but Teddy saved arguably his best production before 1996, for Guy. This album is classic till this day with hits like groove me, teddy's jam, dance dont clap your hands, you can call me crazy, i like, peice of my love, my business, spend the night and goodbye love. R Kelly owes his early 90's career to Aaron Hall. Take one listen to the first Guy album then close your eyes and listen to R Kelly's first album with Honey Love. See what I mean. Classic album from a classic group. Peace."
4,excellent,one of the best urban albums ever. allmost every song on this album is incredibly catchy ..puts there new album to shame
2,Defective product been weeks still no refund or exchange,"this ole school music is what I like. but when trying to listen to this CD I was very disappointed because 2 tracks didn't play. to be exact...track 8 skipped & track 9 won't play at all. I sent it back. we will have to wait and see what happens. By the way, shipping cost more than the CD"
2,Absolute beginners may find this book useful,"Absolute beginners may find this book useful, but eventually beginners may want to learn music in reasonable depth and apply themselves to a traditional method book. On the other hand, it is true that in many respects rock music is different from traditional forms of music. A very good book that addresses itself to some of these differences is PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
3,"very lame, but hey maybe it will help","I really wish to a least be able to speak a little spanish and read it. This program actoring well it is queso ( chessey) and i hope they got better jobs nows. I hope I did not waste the money, but only time will tell."
3,Riddled with Errors,"Though the DVDs cover a lot of good material for the beginner, it is riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes. Actors will say one phrase and the corresponding text doesn't exactly match. If you are not an absolute beginner at Spanish, you may realize these mistakes. It indicates to me that the creators/marketers didn't think enough of us to do a professional review of their material before releasing it."
1,Bad instruction,"The DVD could be a great medium to teach spanish basics, but this is just plain silly. Even as a beginner, I spotted mistakes like in incorrectly accenting ""esta"". Who knows how they chose the vocabulary -- some words are presented that you really wouldn't ever use. They start to teach ser and estar, and then go into why it's OK to leave out the subject pronouns. Aside from my specific gripes, it's all too silly, aiming for a 4th or 5th grade slapsick level. DVD is 99% english (and even most of that is unneeded and a waste of time) and 1% spanish. Perhaps people would enjoy the silly images, but I'm sure that there's no spanish language teaching here."
1,Same Program Different Titles,"Normally I would have given a 5 star rating BUT I first bought Advanced Spanish - Beyond the Basics. I liked it so much I bought Advanced Spanish - Verbs, Spanish 1&2 and ¿Habla Español?. My tape of Advanced Spanish - Verbs is IDENTICAL to Advanced Spanish - Beyong the Basics. In fact it had that as the title for the video when you view the tape. The DVD of ¿Habla Español? is IDENTICAL to the Spanish 1 tape except for some quizzes. I wrote the company with this complaint and got no answer. If you go to their site you will find about 20 Advanced Spanish DVDs that have descriptions that all appear to be the same DVD with different titles. I would definitely not buy Spanish 1. Instead buy the ¿Habla Español? DVD. Other than this, I would be very careful buying from this company."
5,Through a glass darkly into the human heart,"This is not a slick production, neither the garden variety tear jerker ... Masumiyet - Innocence creates a category of its own. Beware though, the acting, the camera work, everything is darkly superb, your heart will ache. I, for one, am sitting staring at the TV screen and silently weeping. When my tears dry I will watch it again to catch the nuances I missed during my first viewing."
3,Entertaining but simplistic science fantasy.,"This book is a pleasing mix of hardcore science fantasy and simple writing which makes it a quick and enjoyable read. If only all books were this comfortable, perhaps more people would read science fantasy."
4,Post-Apocalyptic Samurai Romp,"Eric Van Lustbader turns samurai fiction on its ear in this SF-tinged sword and sorcery tale. We follow the adventures of Ronin, a gifted, self-conflicted warrior, trapped in a decaying underground community that has been cut off from the rest of the world. With advanced technology increasingly falling into disrepair, conflicts in the Freehold are settled by swordplay, which makes dueling experts like Ronin valuable to the powers that be. The Sunset Warrior is an entertaining mix of political intrigue, love, loss, betrayal and vividly described battle scenes. It's a bit uneven in places, and Ronin is not as sympathetic a character as some readers might like, but these minor complaints aside, this is a fun, fast, exciting read, highly recommended to fans of escapist fiction."
4,A unique sci-fi world,"The author creates an interesting and unique world for this novel. The post apoclayptic world that this story takes place in is a combination of a feudalistic society and a one where ""big brother is watching"". The protaganist, Ronin, is a brooding anti-hero who I found a little difficult to like, but I guess that's always the case with anti-heroes. Regardless, I really enjoyed this book, but for most part it was laying the groundwork for the rest of the series. I'll reserve judgement until I read the rest of the books"
5,Great!,The gardenias came within a few days. They packaged the gardenia nicely and it came in one piece. There are blossoms and about 7 will bloom in 2 - 3 days. Great house plant or gift!
4,"Nice gift, but not super hardy","I sent this as a gift to someone in Los Angeles. She really liked it, but it eventually died. It was pretty finicky, but the one year she had it the blooms were very nice. It's supposed to be good for her zone, but she's not a great gardener or anything. I'm just saying if you aren't a good gardener, it might not live."
4,"Great plant, some branches dry","We just got this in today. It's actually a decent-sized plant, but doesn't come with flowers (although I understand those will grow). They shipped very quickly (we got ours in 4 days of ordering). A few of the branches seemed a bit dry, so we are a bit worried about the plant's health. However, we immediately watered it and will monitor the situation. Other than that, these are great gifts."
3,"War on the Eastern Front: The German Soldier in Russia, 1941","The Eastern Front was by far the deciding factor in ending WWII. By the time the Allies opened up a second front in the West, the Germans were already heading for defeat.I anticipated more personal stories from a soldiers point of view rather I found the book contained more narative explanations.The book does contain some chilling accounts of the life of a german soldiers during the Eastern campaign."
2,The writer seems pretty pro Nazi,"I thought the writer made too many excuses for the SS and their actions. It has some interesting tactical information, but I do not agree with the beliefs of the writer on what the SS really was about. I did not feel the book was worth buying...get it from a library."
2,Don't Quit Your Day Job,"With many AA authors on the scene today, and most of them write romance novels, probably 75% of these authors need not quit their day jobs. This author is among that percentage. This story moves in too many directions. The story is old and stale. There was nothing new learned from it. Grant it, novels are supposed to be entertaining, but also filled with education and enlightenment and maybe even encouragement. It was missing in this story. Why Sleeping Dogs Lie is a bad attempt at soap operatic. I couldn't recommend this one."
3,Just okay,"This novel was ""just okay"" in my personal opinion. The author spent a great deal of time describing designer fashions. That really worked a nerve. There was definitely a lot of drama going on in the book, but I found myself getting lost every now and then because she tended to jump from one thing to another. I also thought it was pretty predictable. I need a book to grasp my full attention and this one did not."
5,Fascinating Read,"Frank Morison's book is a fascinating read. We have used this book 3 times for Adult Education Classes in our Church. I highly recommend this book for believers, skeptics or in-betweeners."
5,The Tomb is empty,Mr. Morison explains how the evidence itself is so convincing that it would take more faith to deny it than to simply accept the truth. He goes into depth regarding each detail of time and place regarding the few days leading up to Christ's crucifixion. A must for anyone who is sceptical (like I was) and who wants to examen the historical evidence as it stands.
2,who moved the stone...boring,"was very excited to read this book, but found it too wordy to be interesting. The write is very knowlegable but does not know how to convey his thoughts to the normal reader.. did not finish the book"
5,God Came to Earth as its Savior--Investigative Report @11,"This prominent English journalist set out to investigate and disprove once and for all the myth of Christianity, the resurrection.In the process, he found faith in the life, death and resurrection for his own salvation.Most of us have heard the historic story retold so many times we think there's no way it can continue to captivate us.Morrison does this through his own testimony of being brought into faith, and the analysis he went through. Fascinating stuff. Great for teens and anyone searching.Apologetics at its best!"
4,thought-provoking apologetic,"This compelling little book will make you think about Christ's tomb and your faith. Morison started out trying to disprove the Easter story as a rational journalist and ended up doing a 180. He still relies on reason and balancing the written source material for his analysis of the aftermath of the crucifixion. He relies on the Gospel accounts enough that believers will likely be strengthened in their faith while those who are skeptical might remain skeptical. He also seems too ready to find the Gospel accounts non-reconcilable in certain details when they can be reconciled (such as whether the figure who confronted Mary Magdalene at the empty tomb was an angel or not, if there were more than one, etc.). Does a nice job of looking at these events from a variety of perspectives. Morison seems to have left no stone unturned in his examination of the resurrection in Who Moved the Stone."
3,ok,"the best songs are funky bass man, i can make you dance. if charlie and the gap band had better production the album would have been better."
4,Nothing but THE TRUTH!!,"I have had this television for well over 2 years and to date I have NOT had any issues with it. It has been moved and shifted around numerous times due to me being in the military. The picture is great for 720p and my kids LOVE watching television and movies on it. Don't let all of the bad press and reviews get to you, this is a good buy. It's large but it's light and very easy to move."
1,"Worked for 13mo - Now broken, common problem","I purchased this TV on January 14th, 2007, still have the receipt. It broke this morning, February 15, 2008. We are outside of the 1yr warranty by 1 month and a day. The TV, when I turn it on, has no picture and the blue power light just blinks. I searched google and found that many people are having the same problem.DO NOT BUY THIS TV!"
3,I'd Have Preferred More Construction Specifics,"I'm an experienced, long-time quilter. The Hunter's Star, though, is far from the usual half-square & quarter-square triangles, or nickels-stitched-into-square-blocks quilt -- this one has angles, biases and inset seams.It is possible the author is so very experienced, her focus is on variety rather than practical aspects of construction. The book offers an interesting variety of different looks that can be achieved with the Hunter's Star, and varied by choices of pattern, color and textures. Those things are well covered.What I'd hoped for was a good-sized section showing step-by-step directions and tips on how to avoid the inevitable stretching that goes with its eccentricities. So -- beauty and novelty aside -- if you want to be ""walked through"" constructing this quilt, look elsewhere. I know that I will."
4,Enthusiastically Recommended!,"Madame Sarah [a biography of Sarah Bernhardt, 1844-1923], Cornelia Otis Skinner [1899-1979]; Houghton Mifflin Company (1967)Excellent, despite the oft-abysmal editing (or lack thereof) that resulted in MS regrettably being assigned a less-than perfect rating. This was unavoidable - having first been spoiled by Skinner's far superior ""Elegant Wits and Grand Horizontals"" (so, read Elegant Wits first).Post Note: Somewhere out there, in the legions of illiterate American horse owners, there must be at least one person who reads histories/biographies.The ""absinthe-minded"" pun (p. 5: ""Alfred de Musset, quietly getting drunk or as one wit put it, `becoming absinthe-minded' "") has been put to use as the name of a horse entered in Monmouth Park's 11th race on August 14, 2010 (the Monmouth Oaks; purse $200,000).But the horse's name - ""Absinthe Minded"" - indicts the owner himself as being just that. The hyphen is missing."
4,Czukay...61 and still going!,"Holger Czukay's newest effort, ""Good Morning Story"" is a brilliant continuation of the tangents he began exploring on the previous ""Moving Pictures"". After some inspired weirdness with 'The Invisible Man', Czukay launches into a 3-song 'rearrangement' of Can's 'Vitamin C' (from their ""Ege Bamyasi""), beginning with a strange 'radio-play-esque' narrative on the first, and shifting into even further deconstructions of the 'Vitamin C' riff. Then after the brilliant 'Atlantis', we move into the long ambient workout of 'Mirage', which seems to hearken back to the droning drift-spaces found on Holger's early ""Canaxis"" effort. Musically, brilliant...but docked a star solely for just being too danged short (it runs about 44 minutes). It'd be nice to have the rest of that disc filled out with more Czukay-musik next time out."
2,"amazing, as usual","Holger Czukay is an artist. There are many composers who are close, but Holger is the definition of artist. This is a FUN cd. Invisible Man reminds one of Ken Nordine...the title cut is like a party set to music...and the 22 minute Mirage is a great ambient piece. Buy this CD and either drive around, or crawl onto the couch, or dance, or drink milk, or dig a small hole, or drive a locomotive, or hold your arms out to either side and roll your head around....but listen to this."
5,One of my lifetime top 10 reads,He makes clear things that you thought you know--but now it is undeniable.One of the most practical books I have ever read--this guy is a genius.
2,Very Disappointed,"My husband and I bought the vector stroller first, and figured we needed to get this infant seat to fit into the stroller properly. Unfortunately this seat is very disappointing. The canopy is just awful, I could not believe what a terrible design this is. The canopy has no form, just a piece of material that slides around. When you push it back it falls down to cover the release handle for the seat. The straps are hard to adjust and the seat doesn't fit well in my car on the base. This is our first car seat purchase, and I just assumed it would be similar in function to the other brands like Graco that I have carried my nephew and niece in, but boy was I wrong. Has anyone tried another carrier that will work with the vector stroller safely???"
3,Car Seat,"The Eddie Bauer car seat seems to be good quality. After putting it all together, I have decided that I do not like the sun shade. The back of sun shade just hangs there annoys me. The directions for installing the car seat into your automobile are very confusing. I have to make an appointment with the local fire department to show me how. There are lots of belts on the base and the actual car seat. I do like the look and the style of the car seat and stroller together."
2,to hot to travel,the new material that companies are using causes the baby to sweat terribly. it isnt easy to install the seat into the base in the car and also not easy to attach it to a snap n go....the only positive thing i found was that the seat is roomier...
2,STRAPS DIFFICULT TO ADJUST,HAD A DIFFICULT TIME ADJUSTING THE STRAPS. TOO MUCH WORK TO TRY & ADJUST STRAPS FROM THE BACK. PREFER OTHER CAR SEATS WITH EASILY ADJUSTABLE STRAPS. WILL NEVER PURCHASE AN EDDIE BAUER CAR SEAT AGAIN.
1,Hate it,"This was a big mistake. I carefully compared and researched infant seats and settled on this becuase it had more padding than the Graco, seemed sturdy and was attractive. I have found it to be a complete pain in the ... to use. The buckle is very difficult to latch. It takes several tries and major coordination. The canopy always falls down and drags under the seat. The fabric is rougher than it appears and chafes the back of the baby's head. It is longer from front to back than most seats. As a result when my 6 foot husband moves the seat back far enough to drive comfortably, the drivers seat bumps into the infant seat. This changes the angle of the recline (compromising the safety)as well as marring the leather on the front seat. It's a Volvo wagon which is not a small car. It is hard to adjust the straps and uncomfortable to carry.Eliminate this one from your list."
1,Very Unsafe!!!,"I put this seat on my baby registry because I loved the look of it. My baby is 11 days old and I am so upset! The top straps came completely undone while I was driving. When I stopped the car I had no one to help me put the seat back together, or hold my newborn so I could get home. I have no idea how it happened because it was completely secure when I left the house. I should have known when it took us 40 minutes to leave the hospital because we could not easily adjust the straps. In addition to the safety issue the seat is very heavy, the top bar snaps so loud that the baby wakes up every time I snap it, it does not rock at all and the buckle is very hard to press in. I am going to try to take it back to babies r us tonight.Please save yourself the trouble!!!"
1,"Inconvenient, difficult to adjust, only good for back facing","I bought this because of a review in some magazine, and BOY was I disappointed!1. The handle doesn't always click in to place; I picked it up and nearly dumped him out of the seat! Horrible!2. It's difficult to place the top piece onto the bottom piece once the bottom piece is fastened into the car. Also doesn't work well at all with a car with shoulder straps.3. Now that he's older, it's time to put the car seat forward-facing; it's nearly IMPOSSIBLE to put the seat in the cradle once it's fastened to the seat facing forward.4. It's not terribly stable; my older son's seat (also an eddie bauer, but different model) is far more stable.All in all, I'm really sorry I bought this seat and wish I'd done more research."
2,Pay attention to all the negative comments about this car seat - they are true,"I own this car seat and have read all of the reviews. Here are the complaints that I have found to be true:- The straps twist all the time- The fabric is a hot fabric and also causes my son to sweat- It is a pain to adjust the straps from the back- In even a mild wind, the canopy blows down- The handle could be more comfortable to hold and it is loudWith all of the options out there for infant carriers, this one is very mediocre. Although none are perfect, I am sure there are others out there with not so many bad features. I would not recommend this to anyone and am planning on taking it to the resale shop soon. I'll definitely choose another brand for my next baby."
3,recall on this car seat,I was just in Babies r us a few days ago and there was a sign posted regarding this car seat. It is being recalled. Check with babies r us for more information. Something with the seat not being safely attached to the base.
1,"Unsafe, Unsafe, Unsafe","I would give this a zero if I could. This carrier is unsafe. Two times now it has flipped our baby over. I am no longer going to use this and am going to try to exchange it for a new one. If that doesn't work, I'll just buy another one because I am not using it another day!"
1,Very Heavy and Bulky,"I purchased this carseat to go along with the matching stroller which I also dislike, and have found that it is extremely difficult to carry before the baby is even put in it. The weight and bulk of this seat is outrageous. Also, the sunshade never stays in place and often trips me while walking. When carrying it, this seat bounces off your knees and does a number on your shoulders. Its size and weight makes it awkward to carry. I can't wait until my son is in the front facing car seat to be finished with this seat once and for all. I am extremely disappointed."
4,Good car seats... Good Investment.,My wife and I have twin girls so we purchased 2 seats to go with the Eddie Bauer stroller. We liked these seats and had very little problems. They attach to the base very well so getting the girls in and out of the car was easy and not very complicated. Washing the cover is not that difficult as the cover easily detaches from the seat and washes to almost new every time. I did read some other reviews and the seats are a little bit warm. We live in a warm climate and the girls did seem to sweat a little bit when hot. Also the straps do tend to twist a bit but untwists without my effort. Also over time they tend to loosen and have to be tightened. Overall we were please with both of our carseats so when we upgraded to the convertible we stayed with the Eddie Bauer (Cosco) product line.
2,"Not bad, but I wouldn't purchase again","I agree with the other reviews that this is a very heavy and bulky carseat. My son is only 2 months old, barely 13 pounds, and this carseat feels like it's ripping my arms out whenever I carry him in it. I'm not a weakling, but it is so big and bulky and H-E-A-V-Y. On the other hand, I have had no problems with the straps and getting it in/out of the car. It's significantly bigger than the Graco snugrides and I find myself looking enviously at other parents who are carrying their infants around in snugrides."
3,good car seat but wont use it for next little one,it's a nice car seat but the snap that goes in between the legs is very hard to get together if your child move just alittle. it's to much of a fight. it is pretty heavy. we have a truck and its pretty hard to get in the vehicle and it takes forever for it to snap in. this is the only child we will use this one for.
1,Not a great infant carrier,"We bought this carrier to attach to our Eddie Bauer stroller, because other brands would not attach to the stroller. The bottom buckle is very difficult to click in to the two buckles from the upper straps. The straps are not very long, I doubt it will last my son until he reaches 20 pounds. The carrier does not lock on to the top of a grocery cart like other brands, so you have to put it in the cart. Then there is no place to put your groceries. Very poor design. I would not have purchased if I was able to see it first vs. buying online. I had already tossed the box, and didn't think I could return it."
3,Shame on the Canadian government,This is a fascinating film for the fact that the quints were not created by fertility drugs but entirely by nature. Even more fascinating is the fact that the Canadian government behaved shamefully by allowing the doctor who assisted at their births to remove them from the custody of their parents and siblings. His exploitation of the babies was fully supported by the government. Good performances by Roy Dupuis (when is he not good) and Celine Bonnier. Judith Doran
2,ni fu ni fa,"La literatura española pasó por una época negra durante el neoclásico. Leyendo esta comedia no pude evitar el acordarme de La Vida Es Sueño, escrita unos ciento y pico de años antes, o La Casa de Bernarda Alba, escrita unos ciento y pico de años después. Qué bajón pegaron las letras en el siglo XVIII. En fin, ahí queda esta obra de Moratín, una comedia graciosilla pero que no tiene ni fu ni fa."
4,"like the shoes, but there ia a small flaw","Overall, I like the shoes--soft but not very comfortable. The strap was placed was bit too close to my daughter's ankles so it bothers her a bit. The delivery is prompt and price is competitive"
2,Not for overweight people,"I bought this to help me lose weight after having a hysterectomy. What I found out is that I'll never be able to wear it outside of my home. While it makes my stomach look slimmer, it pushes everything up. You end up with back buldge. If you are short, it probably works great. If you are tall and a little over weight, you need a much taller one. Also, I can't eat when I wear it. Because it compresses everything and puts pressure on my insides, I vomit when I eat. I probably won't wear this long. I also don't see how you could wear this as a maternity wrap. I just don't think it would work."
1,waste of money,"Being in the military, I have a limited amount of time to get back in shape after having a baby. Along with daily exercise and a super healthy diet, I bought this item to help out. Sure it helped me look alright under clothing(assuming I didn't move far or sit down) but that was the only benefit. Every time I sat down, it would scrunch up. After I left the hospital, I had a 34in waist. This product was FAR too tight. My husband had to help me and even he struggled. I wouldn't recommend this product to my worst enemy. If you're looking for something that actually works, buy the ""lytess new mom wasp waist panty"" from blissworld.com I'm almost back to my pre-pregnancy size!"
1,Underworks Post Delivery Belt,"Please dont waste your money for this product. It is waste... I never recommend for any one i know.After a week of buying this, it lost its elasticity..Never buy"
3,Not really working for me.,"The product is okay, I guess it would work for people who don't have big hips like me. My problem is getting it down low enough, then keeping it there once I'm moving around. It usually folds up. Also it creates a ""reverse muffin top"" but i guess that can't be helped, LOL. It's really hard to put on smoothly as well. i guess for the price it's better than nothing."
4,Good product,Works great for postpartum. I have rated this product 4 stars because it won't fit if you are plus size. No use buying it unless you are NOT in the plus size category.
4,Good belt - don't pay more,This has good support - don't buy the more expensive ones - they are stiff and uncomfortable. I'm not a skinny gal and this helped me much better than the pricey ones.
3,It did the job for the first two weeks,"This was a great product for the first two weeks, assisted with getting out of bed and bending down to pick up things and made me feel like I had a waist again after my c section. After that point it stretched out and the velcro no longer stuck on firmly and would slowly just come apart and fall off, as well it would crease and roll from the bottom and top as you sit. The sizing is wrong, I ordered a medium and they sent a small, thankfully it was a ""good"" mistake on the companies part. I think my waist was a 38 and this belt fit!"
3,not bad,its not bad for the price but its dispossable after one or two washes. It got really stiff after i dryed it. I guess it need to air dry but i would not buy it again
5,works!,I swear by this thing. I put it on within 24 hours of delivering my baby and I think it helped my waist go back to a normal size quicker. I also thought the firm support felt good.
3,Worked decently for a couple weeks,"I didn't want to pay a lot for one of these so I guess I wasn't surprised by the quality. It worked well enough for the first couple of weeks postpartum, though you can often see the belt under your clothing. But then the velcro started to go, and now five weeks later it doesn't stay on at all. My belly is going away anyway, but if you want one that lasts longer this isn't for you."
4,Good Fit After Home for a While,"I bought this size thinking that it would fit me right away. I was a 29"" waist size 4 or 6 pre. And a size 10 after. Was too small right away. After a few weeks of being home I could finally get it around me. It was tight, but is supposed to be. It really helped. Get a bigger size, you can always adjust it. The hospital gave me one to take right away so I got lucky."
2,Uncomfortable and Silly,"I had my first baby via c-section. Like most new moms I was looking for a way to ""hide"" or get a jump start on losing my post baby belly. I read reviews of this product and for the price thought it was worth a shot. I wore it for about a week (for an hour at a time). It was pretty uncomfortable and was not to worn out of the house. It flattened my stomach but just pushed the excess fat (in the front and back) up above the girdle. Not the look I was going for! This girdle was not for me. I suggest saving your money and just give your body time to get back to pre-baby. It did just go through war after all!"
4,give it a shot,"I tried this out 3 months after giving birth. I think it would be more effective right afterwards. I do notice a difference however. I was pretty thin before and I had a little sag after my baby. I tried exercise but it didn't seem to do too much. I wore this at night and a little bit through the day and if you wear it long enough, you notice a flattening (sp?). Only issue I have is that it crinkles up after a while and you can see it through your clothes (like an unnatural muffin top or just dents). If you wash it regularly and dry it (which it says not to do but I did it anyway) they go away. Try it out, it might work for you. I still have a little sag but it's slowly going away and the more I use this the better it looks to me."
2,Poor Post Delivery Belt,"This belt does not fit the way it is advertised in the photo, because it is not tapered for the difference in size between waist and hip. As a result, it tends to ride up while you walk!!! It also is quite difficult to put on without assistance. Strong material and super handy velcro are a plus, but everything is a minus!!!"
3,"it works, but it's thin...",The sizing chart is definitely accurate. I bought a larger size thinking that I'd be cautious and ended up swimming in it. Had to return it right away. It's thin so I found that it crinkled and rose up whenever I wore it.
1,Uncomfortable and cheap,This item is very scratchy and uncomfortable. It rides up or down while wearing it and can easily be seen under clothing. I don't recommend it.
2,Wore it like 3x,I didn't like it. Maybe it was just me but it did roll up like someone said. You can still see it under your shirt to :-/
2,Itches,"It's rigid, as it should be to hold the belly in, but the bottom of the fabric itches my upper legs - no wonder the woman on the picture wears shorts with it :)"
5,Love it!,It really helped me in getting my tummy back to pre pregnancy size within 3 weeks. I wish I knew about it in my first pregnancy..now I just need to lose my tummy flab I got after my first pregnancy!
3,Good for the price but not good as a I expected,"I bought the medium size of this product after reading some reviews. It was delivered in 3 days. Once I get it,it was so big in size for me then I send it back for exchange. They sent me back the small size which is my exact one. For the first week it was good: soft,tight,and simple. But then it started to roll up and look like a big thread on my west.not convinient to wear it and to go to work.As an option I'm wearing it in the evening then put off in the morning."
1,Mega waste of my money,So I had 2 kids back to back and the muffin top of course. I figure this product would help me to fit into my shirts better. What a painful waste. This thing is clumpy at best. The velcro seam doesn't even lay flat. It's painful to wear and total waste of money.
3,EVERY MOM SHOULD HAVE ONE,"IT REALLY WORKS BUT THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS. WHEN YOU BEND IT ROLLS UP AND ALSO IT SEEMS TO GIVE MORE OVER TIME AND FROM WASH TO WASH. BUT, IT HELPED ME LOSE WEIGHT AND WATER AFTER BABY WAS BORN. I STARTED TO USE IT THE DAY AFTER MY SON WAS BORN AND IN A MONTH I LOST 30LBS."
3,sized too large,too big. if it was smaller would have been great support. I might order smaller one. this one will go to waste.
4,Happy with the results,"I liked the belt, it was a little bothersome to wear and rode up at times. It does a good job and when worn post partum immediately it was very effective."
3,It's ok but,It's good material but you should get a size smaller. I had to cut mine for it to work well. All in all it's a good product.
4,Great product,Great product. Runs large. Small size worked great for me being dress size 10. Very flexible and extremely comfortable. I love it! Would buy another anytime.
3,Burst blood vessels,"The girdle works fairly well - good compression. But it's quite stiff, and poked in in some places, or folded over in others, which resulted in visible ""bulges"" through light clothing. It also burst blood vessels on my sides. But it does the job it is supposed to do. I just tried an underwear-style equivalent, and it just doesn't suck you in as well, so think the Underworks Girdle Belt approach is better."
4,Helped minimal.,Used after my last babies birth. I bought a medium am small statured and only weighed 145 after having baby. The medium was way to big for me. Needed to be tighter. Only wore for about three weeks as it become too big very quickly. Get a size down from the recommended sizes. If the size would have been appropriate I might have liked the fit.
3,rolls up,"seemed to help but it rolled on both ends almost immediately. i definitely needed it the 1st few days to look better in my clothe, but i only wore it for the 1st week or so"
4,Wish it was more strudy,"This girdle worked really well for my post-partum recovery from a planned c-section (breech fetus). When I wore it, it took the weight off of my scar and helped tremendously with pain relief.My only complaint is that is was pretty flimsy and did not last past the first wash. After the second wash it began tearing at the seams and I had to throw it away.Overall, for $16 it did what I wanted it to - made my recovery less painful."
4,Glad I read the reviews,"I was really glad that I read all of the reviews from other women with their note to go down a size. I should have ordered the medium according to their system, but ordered the small after reading the warnings. It was the right size, so I am glad I did. I am not sure if this belt is helping things come together faster or not (this is my first baby) but it does make me feel more secure and a bit more held together, especially in the first few days after having my son. Anything that can make your body feel better after 24 hours of labour is greatly appreciated!"
2,definitely check with Dr. first!,"This would be a great idea for a post c-section operation...however, you need to check with your Dr. first. I was advised not to use it b/c it could affect the way my scar would heal. Stick with a pillow if you're worried about sneezing or laughing!"
4,Can't wait to try this,"I purchased this for my post-partum recovery. (I'm still pregnant) I think it will help, but it looks a little cheap. This one is very wide so it should help tighten up all the skin around the abdomen and sides. Target sells a Medella brand maternity belt that looks like it will hold up for a longer period of wear than this one. But the Medella one is only about 6 inches wide, so it looks like it doesn't tighten everything that has stretched. I still can't wait to use this belt after I delivery to see if it helps with my recovery."
4,Great for C-sections,"I had a C-section and it really holds your belly. It is really hard after you delivery, your belly is still huge and you feel all your organs moving around when you walk and go to bed. It is not comfortable at all. But with this belt I could have a better night of sleep. I bought the size small ( I was size 6 before getting pregnant and I gained in my pregnancy 32 pounds), but if your size is petite, buy medium size because I could only wear this belt after a few weeks (it was still very small for my big belly after delivery) but I still could enjoy the benefits of this belt because it takes awhile for you belly to come back to normal (at least 1 1/2 month for me)."
2,It doesn't work any more after 2 weeks,"The belt doesn't stick any more after a few days unless you change the place to stick it, but then your belly won't change the size in a few days.."
3,So Far....,It's 4 weeks past my delivery date and I haven't really notice too much of a change. I think the material could've been made a bit thicker but other than that it's ok comfort wise. I have never purchase anything like this so it's hard to make a comparison. I will continue to wear it to see results!
3,It's Okay....,"This product runs big so order a size smaller if you really want a good fit. Unfortunately, I relied on the sizing chart and ordered a L, it was too big and didn't really provide the support I needed after my c-section. It rolls up and is very noticeable under clothes. I would recommend spending a little more and getting a better quality one."
2,not what i expected,"The sizing on this was way off, I had to return it. My neighbor actually gave me one that she had from her pregnancy and I used it for a couple days before it drove me crazy. It really dosen't flatter anything when using under clothes but I still do use it when I am doing a lot of lifting or walking with the baby...it certainly provides support."
2,Okay but not great,"I was looking forward to using this item after I had my baby this past January (c section) but was somewhat dissapointed when I received it. It creases in the middle just after the first use. It is somewhat uncomfortable and bulky, but for $15 dollars what do you expect? I have a long torso and would have perferred something with more coverage and control. If you are looking for something of higher quality and comfort I wouldn't buy this product."
3,Interesting Information about Human Rights and Countries,"The ""Human Rights Watch World Report 1996"" is a very interesting and an important collection of the human rights violations taking place around the world. Written by Human Rights Watch, a non-profit organization that is dedicated to protecting the human rights of people worldwide and challenging all governments and those in power to respect international human rights laws, the report explores human right violations worldwide.The report is very inclusive, reporting on large countries such as the United States to smaller second and third world countries. The book is organized by regions (Americas, Europe, Asia, etc.) then by countries with a detailed account of the human rights violations taking place within each country. This is an excellent research resource for those exploring the conditions of a particular country and wish to learn more about the human right of a particular country."
1,Crown was delivered broken twice!,The origianl costume arrived with the crown broken. Customer service was wonderful and sent another one out to me but that also arrived broken.
3,"A good, spirited performance","The thing that undermines the performance, however, is Philips's sound, which the company recorded live, with all its attendant problems. No matter how loud the music gets, it always seems reticent, held back, distanced, and muted. Thus, much of the animation Gergiev attempts to generate rather evaporates within the softly shrouded sonics.John J. PuccioClassical Candor"
3,An interesting trip,"Tracing Cowboys is flawed, but oddly beautiful made more so by knowing of the death of the lead actor before the actual completion of the film. The cinematography is the same. Sometimes overly ""artsy"" and sometimes beautiful. The filming local in the Baja Peninsula is incredibly beautiful making it a worthwhile look just in itself. Don't expect ""Great Expectations"", just enjoy it for what it is."
5,Bertolucci Is Brilliant!,"I found this film by accident and immediately fell in love with it. The cast is beautiful, the acting extrordinary and the directing brilliant. The explicit nude/sex scenes created a stir about the film and it didn't do well in the United States, until underground word-of-mouth brought it to people's attention. If you're a film lover, you'll love this movie. Michael Pit and Eva Green are amazing talents. If you liked ""Stealing Beauty"", then you should watch this film. However, go into it with a very open mind, and pay attention to the environment of the film!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though Eva Green is gorgeous to look at and it's nice to see a movie in which sex plays a large role that doesn't make sex look choreographed, The Dreamers never manages to capture the potential of its sexual-freedom-meets-May68 plot and thus remains more of an interesting failure than an accomplished movie."
5,"Watch it alone, or when you're about to enjoy yourself ;)","This movie was amazing! It's a movie about French movies, and the plot is really nice and funny. I really enjoyed watching this movie. If you're gonna watch it, watch it by yourself, or with your partner. It's very VERY sexual. Loved it!"
1,Le Testament Terrible.,"This film is a weak attempt to place Cocteau's ""Les Enfants Terribles"" into a new context, and sadly the result is total vulgarization and profanity. To everyone familiar with Cocteau's book, this is all so predictable and banal, in addition acting is poor and eroticism is primitive. There is lots of pretension, quoting Proust among other things, and all the references to TRUE masterpieces are the best parts, but this resulting cocktail is of a bad taste, in all respects. Weakness and impotence of thought are prevailing, and it is unbelievable that it came from the same director as Last Tango in Paris, which is full of dark passions. Here one sees some cheap sentimentality mixed with graphic scenes representing erotic dreams of an adolescent, but the overall impression is boredom and flaccidity. What a degradation..."
1,Porn disguised as Art,"What i find sad is Amazon decided that i was an ideal candiate for this movie the day after i saw it.I saw it uncensored at the Cinema in Singapore yesterday as a single seated in the double love seat row. This made it hard to get past the knotted bodies. If i'd been on the end of the row i would have snuck out to the bathroom and never come back. Eating garbage out of a dustbin and smearing semen on people and pictures does not set you free or show you to be a great creative thinker. Visual imagery is one thing but trying to find a plot or a message here was like panning for gold in a stream of effluent.Its not erotic, its not funny, there is no plot and it doesnt make you think. There are no reasons to see this film."
2,"Worth a rental, not a purchase","I viewed this film in the theater and nearly walked out in disgust. The adult content was not the issue, but rather the shining spot of this self-indulgent piece of tripe. Visually it made me physically ill, and the woman I took to see this flick said she couldn't remember the last time she had seen such a horrible movie."
1,Boring,Boring story about spoiled people.Drab people and uninteresting script make this a real yawner. Don't even rent it for the nudity.
2,DUDSVILLE,"I didn't believe for a moment the three main characters in this film were truly film buffs, their conversations on the subject were superficial and pedestrian. The incestuous relationship between two of them is absurb given their very ordinary lives and the film never explains the roots of the sibling's desire. The psychological movie games they played were as harmless and dull as children playing dress-up and seemed an excuse for a more exotic fantasy. This film about an American youth hooking up with sibling students in France during the Vietnam era is not an homage to movies or art or the French cinema, it is an attempt at sexual tension but the result is limp."
1,no worth the 30 cents to make the disk,"This movie was very dry unless you enjoy philosophy and people sitting around naked all day wasting their time talking about nothing. The movie focuses in on an idiotic American who obviously was weaned off his mother's tits too late because he is super socially awkward, then he gets thrown into a life of alcohol sex and doing whatever he wants, which amounted to about nothing of value. The girl is a girl that has been messed up by a incestuous relationship with her brother that distorts her relationship with the idiot American and causes her to act very strangely.I give this movie 4 thumbs down"
2,"Lots of flesh, not much bite.","Even if the extensive nudity appeals to your lustfulness.Even if you find the borderline incestuous subplot intriguing.And even if you enjoy watching the dysfunction that is French culture, you will probably be left in a state of desire after this flick. I don't mind racy and unique, but I do mind a plot that is very underdeveloped. It seems quite obvious that Bertolucci attempts to plug all the holes with young smooth flesh, and in fact the acting is pretty good, but all and all there is no overcoming a monotonous storyline, littered with unexplored avenues that could have exploited. Write it off as a late night soft porno and you might find yourself mildly entertained, otherwise your in for a long night."
4,What the???,"Fresh, sexy, thoughtful. One of those weird artsy films with very nice scenery. You just like the show and can't figure out why. Shared this DVD with a lot of friends who all had a different opion."
3,Depressing Erotica,"Actually, this was an attempt at erotica. There is really only one semi-erotic scene, and even that ends in tears. A young man comes across a brother and sister who, if you have read the synopsis, are closer than siblings should be. While their parents are away they are forced to eat out of the dumpster, too poor to buy any food. Personally, I don't like to feel this low after watching a movie. Gave it three stars because the acting was fairly good. But still, depressing."
1,Lousy and confusing movie,"The movie is confusing and hard to follow..Would not recommend anyone to purchase this movie. I am especially concerned that Amazon even offers this movie...The fact is, I threw it in the trash !"
1,A horrid mess of a movie,"Grim and pointless. Left me wanting to strangle all three actors. Do they still sell the foam TV brick? Well, if I had a real brick it would be worth the price of a new television. I'm so grateful no one dragged me to this when it played in the theaters, or else I would have demanded my money back."
2,ehhhhh dont believe the hype,"What exactly was the point of this film? Close up shots of body parts? Plot was lacking. Acting is stiff. Burtolucci has done much, much better."
2,Complete disappointment,"I caught this movie on cable and thought that it was a waste of time and celluloid.Bertolucci seems to have a fetish for young, nubile actors.I felt sorry for them.Nowhere is the crude nudity pushing the plot further.This is the most unerotic and unengaging movie.The characters are boring and none of their actions seems genuine.The story is very unrealistic,the characters are boringly, not endearingly immature and their conversations about cinema are contrite.At no point did I believe this people had the intellectual accumen to carry such lofty conversations.If you want to see a lovely French movie about movie buffs: I suggest the 80s movie Travelling Avant: far more interesting!"
4,good Bertolucci,A nostalgic treat for me who also was an adventurous expatriate in that era. I remember 1968 is Paris quite well and wish there had been more story line revolving around the political and social upheaval that spring. Eva Green was radiant
2,Tittalating but boring,"Okay - the so-called sex scenes are probably what sold this movie - the soft-core nudity and frank discussions about reproduction and recreation do not build anything toward a rewarding climax. The story lingers, waits, stalls, lingers more, then sort of just ends - you know the movie's over because the credits are rolling - I don't know what others may say about this - but I can't recc this without saying - ""If you're only in it to see a little frontal nudity, this film's for you"" -Michael Pitt is a great actor - I hope he chooses his future roles a little more carefully -"
3,"ambitious, doctrinaire, disappointing","The heroine has just arranged to use household gas to kill herself, her brother and the close friend who is the third member of their menage a trois, when the murder-suicide is interupted by a rock that comes crashing through the window thrown by a student rioter. The heroine quickly replaces the gas hose, without the two males noticing, and then, with them, joins the rioters. The friend, who is American, holds back, but the heroine and her brother, as a continuation of their refusal to become adult, battle the police.There's a lot of sex in the movie but it's sex in the service of remaining pre-adult. The bodies are adult, but -- with the eventual exception of the American friend -- not the people who inhabit them."
4,nice movie but not for teenagers,"this movie is actually for baby-boomer generation. while tens of thousands american young men drafted to die or crippled in vietnam, while clinton ran to london, shrub enlisted in texas national guard, gore also in national guard, this american kid went to paris to learn 'how to speak french' and 'how to make love to a french virgin'. that's pretty deep. this is actually a quite serious movie although you've got to see a lot naked bodies and x-rated love makings, but it's a fine movie. not too deep, nor too shallow."
3,Review of The Dreamers,"Good movie. I enjoyed it. Nothing spectacular, except maybe the nudity in it. Full frontal, both male and female, which is unusual in a movie for the males, even for an up-and-coming actor like Michael Pitt. Plot dealt with the rioting in Paris, France in 1968 (I think that was the year)."
2,Michael Pitt,"I have mixed reviews about this movie, I like the setting, didn't enjoy the sex scenes that much."
3,cool look at free thought,i really enjoyed the way free thought and expression was protrayed. interesting look of the time. great look at young carefree love.
3,The Dreamers (Original Uncut NC-17 Version),"This movie is intriguing and beautifully artistic. This movie is a bit awkward at the same time, but if you like a movie that is disturbing and to the point where you can not look away at the same time then i recommend the movie. The only downside to the movie is the ending it leaves you wanting more."
1,What can I say...,"You either like it or hate it. The only thing I liked about the movie was the naked pretty girl. That is all. It had no real redeeming characters. It was about youth who are self-indulgent at the expense of everything else in life. Come to think of it, the typical American liberal between 17 and 35 should love it, but no one else should waste their time on it. Tripe! Bertolucci is so much better than this material. Why he made it is a mystery!"
4,68 generation bourgeois - A film by Bertolucci,This movie really cool. It is not only includes sexual abnormalty of teenegers but aslo bourgeois of 68 generation who believe that they are a real comunist.
2,"Of course, bertolucci is in his element, but...","who want's to watch Michael Pitt? Or Eva Green? If you like marlon brandos' ""last Tango in Paris"" this plot wouldn't surprise you really...I don't have problems with Eva Grenn, very attractive girl, (2005 Kingdom of Heaven with orlando Bloom), but she look's because of the other actors a little ...? i don't know"
1,Fahrenheit &#65533;Dreamers&#65533;,"This is a pointless movie that upholds depraved state-of-mind, despicable way-of-life and unwanted unlovely mood. Rent it or buy it, remember it is for the most wayward, reckless and low-class of humanity (as far as our common morality and values go!) To be honest with you, the repugnance of the movie didn't let me finish; I had to stop and eject since I don't fall in the above category. Peace to all!"
1,Needed more Charlie Sheen and explosions,"I love porn, and, like porn, this movie had an abundance of ying yang, however, unfortunately, The Dreamers is not porn, and consequently I do not love it. 0/5"
5,The Dreamers (Original Uncut NC-17 Version),Was a GREAT movie the added real footage was special also the sex scens where done in a very EROTIC yet TASTEFUL way.
2,sex sells,"The only time I ever walked out of a cinema half-way through a film it was a Bertolucci flick. I read a good review of The Dreamers and thought I would check it out. The tagline is 'Cinema, Sex, Politics.' The cinema is mostly sixties French, not my cup of tea, so that leaves the politics and sex. This film probably has a nostalgic appeal to those who were inspired by Paris '68, but I was in nappies, so onto the sex. The actress is hot, but in these mutlimedia days a naked woman is not the thrill it was when I was 15. I like films for their stories, and this one doesn't really work. The climax is very artificial, involving the return of parents who are estranged emotionally from their children, but the effect it has on the daughter is absurdly extreme. The acting is shabby, and all in all it comes off as an aging director using his clout to get sexual kicks on set. Still, it has a ton of reviews here on Amazon, so that's my title and bottom line - sex sells."
2,Overrated and Boring,"I really don't understand how people could like this movie. It's boring, too long (for a movie where nothing exciting happens), cliche, not funny, not sexy and the characters I couldn't relate to or care about. Also, the sister/brother relationship is downright creepy and frankly quite gross. The sex is boring, especially disappointing since this is the NC-17 uncut version (the regular R rated version I'd probably give one star). Skip this one - or at the most get it at your local library."
2,Weird,"This movie is weird to say the least. The story line is very poorly developed and it the movie is only driven by the sexual tension between the main characters. I imagine that this movie has been popularized by the success of Eva Green in Casino Royale, and if your goal is to see her nude then you will have plenty of it here. But trust me, it is NOT worth having to watch this god awful movie just to see her. Please, for your own sake, don't watch this movie, you will regret it."
1,Bought this after seeing Eva in Kingdom of Heaven...,"She did a terrific job in KOH, and that's not to say she didn't do a good job in The Dreamers.. But it's just that 'The Dreamers' wasn't much too look at from my point of view. I know some films are suppose to have this eloquent beauty to them but I couldn't even find that here. I bought this thinking 100% that I would not like it but love it...and I was quite disappointed, because I didn't even like it. Don't get me wrong, the acting on all parts was fine. Michael Pitt did an excellent job as well. It is just the movie itself that I had a problem with. I've never had a problem with nudity in any film, but I thought the majority of every nude shot in this film was completely pointless and tasteless. I can't say that everyone is going to agree with me, I know a lot of people really liked the film. But honestly, save your money. This DVD is sitting in my closet collecting dust."
4,Dreamy,"I was mesmerized by this story and was disappointed when it ended. This film is simply lovely and dare I say it--dreamy. I loved the fact that the director didn't shy away from incorporating classic films and he did so seamlessly. The music, the actors (particularly Eva Green), and the cinematography are in top form. I really enjoyed the artistic value of this film, although I can understand why this film wouldn't appeal to others. The extras are not closed captioned."
5,Excellent movie with superb actors,"Yesterday I saw this film. I hoped it would transmit the feeling of the '68 and the film did. Not only the menage a trois but also the surrounding atmosphere of Paris and the streets have also been really fantastic.The sex scenes of two of the three main-actors has been really realistic and often quoted as reality and not acting. From my point of view great parts of the film focuses on the relationship between the three characters which has the result that a great part of the ""real"" history has to be reduced."
3,Nothing Special,"Interesting because of the period, but seemed to have a discontinuity to the story line; left me empty."
3,Artsy,Forgetting about the sex. Dreamers is an artsy movie. I especially like how fim and classic cinema. I would've have enjoyed the movie more if I knew more about France in the 60s.The sex is nothing graphic. I've seen more disturbing images in Showgirls.
2,boring,"The movie is very slow to start, begins to pick up some interest and show promise but then fades into slow, boring, lackluster dialogue. The basic story premise is sound but the talent of the actors is wasted and the sexual tension between the characters is never fully developed. I expected more physical interaction between the three, instead, the action seem stifled and unfinished. I feel that the actors were are not allowed to fully utilize their obvious talents. The explicit sex scenes are also unimaginative and did not live up to the ""dust jacket"" billing. I was very disappointed in the film."
3,"Once, twice but not thrice.","First this flicka started slow, then it somewhat draws you in, maybe simply because you are watchin it. Twill be viewed twine, but likely not a third time. For it's price it was entertaining. NPC"
3,eva green showcase,"This is an odd little movie, but then it is a Bertoluci movie. The plot is about two weird self-indulgent French siblings and an American boy along for the ride on their erotic meanderings through the May 1968 Paris riots.It is fully deserving of it's nc-17 rating and Eva Green is amazing in her nudity."
2,"An indulgent ""Dreamers""","""The Dreamers"" is indeed Bertolucci's Valentine to films. (The ones he likes, at least.) But so what? Many of the films referenced I have seen, some I have not. Nevertheless, it all plays like an erotic Trivial Pursuit game. The sex is graphic, but ultimately boring. Roger Ebert in his review talks about the sex existing within a successfully created context. I disagree, and have to wonder seriously about reviews from cinema wonks. There is a corresponding irony in the film that perhaps Ebert should take to heart when serving up such questionable verdicts: Theo masturbating on a poster of Marlene Dietrich. I think a better erotic/art film example could be found in ""Henry & June."" Not perfect by any means, but at least Miller and Nin were creators . ""The Dreamers"" only offers spoiled posers. Two stars for some good camera work."
3,Not what I expected,"I knew this film would be weird, but I did expect the fighting,nor the ending. It does keep you watching though."
1,sucked,the movie was NOT worth it at all i thought it was gonna have more porn in it and im not into incest and i threw the movie away because of it
2,"Without treading the same ground over for the 1000th time,","I'll try to keep this short. No; not one of Bertolucci's best; in fact, it may be one of his worst. It starts out superbly, then slowly slides into a morass both screenwriter and director apparently had trouble getting out of. The photgraphy and imagery are OK; it's the plot, or actually the lack of one with any real depth, that ultimately sinks this. You get the basics early on; the remainder seems to be mindless chatter, or an attempt to shock. The ending is, as another reviewer said a little strongly, not only shocking but far, far too sudden. Absolutely nothing is really wrapped up, and it starts becoming somewhat cloying before that. Buy it cheap."
2,Art House....Keep Dreaming,"The Dreamers is set in Paris during the student riots of the 60's. It follows two siblings, Theo and Isabelle, and an American foreign exchange student Matthew. The Parisian setting is the last bit of the social strife brought up in the movie until the end. The bulk of the movie is spent with the main characters exploring their sexuality. There are some watchable parts to the movie, but for the most part it was good only if you like gratuitous nudity. I know that it is labeled as an artsy movie and that is what Bertolucci is known for but it seems to be less of a thinking movie and more of an excuse for Eva Green to get naked. If that's what you're looking for then this movie is for you but if you are looking for a good period piece then I would look to somewhere else."
2,Yuk!,"Perhaps if you were caught up in the time this movie portrays, then maybe you would enjoy it. For me it seem well boring to some degree."
3,devolution,"Hello,I bought this DVD film, but I can't see it in my country, Spain. I think the DVD system is not compatible with this DVD.How can I make a devolution of this DVD??Thanx you, and sorry...."
2,not what I expected,"After reading just a few of the reviews I thought this would be a really good movie. It was different from other movies. There was quite a bit that was boring, but worth the $6."
1,This wants to be a lost Eden...,"Not to be a knee-jerk moralistic American, but this was vile and disgusting. Where was the film in this blue movie??? Recreating the famous scenes of other films does not a movie make. The shadow of the violent student protests in Paris, the incestuous brother and sister, the naive American obsessed with them, the dilapidated apartment--none of these constructs tell a story. This is pretentious and bad, the worst combination."
1,"boring boring boring and um... oh yeah, boring","...if you're seriously going to shell out money on this, than you desparately want to see some nudity, why else then would you want to watch three people try to act (one of whom is from Dawson's Creek) and pretend they like old french cinema...if sisters and brothers being together sexually is your thing, than get some help, don't get this crappy movie..."
2,Can't hold my attention,I bought this like 3 years ago to watch with a date. I found it pretty slow moving. We ended up getting distracted and then falling asleep toward the beginning. I wasn't impressed.
2,yucky sorry.,Seen it late one nite. Maybe i was just sleepy but it was kinda disturbing. The twins had this thing for each other. it's just gross. haha but watch it if you're curious.
2,interior life,"One reviewer said this movie is remarkably voyeuristic; the problem is: I cannot imagine who would want to see the things that go on within the dreamworld of these three young people in 1968 Paris.Watching the previews for this film in the months preceding its release, I could only think this was another overdone Bertolucci homage to excess. When I did see it in its totality I was dumbfounded by its pointlessness, though, it captured the revolutionary excitement and free-spirited dynamic of Paris in that era. The sickening relationship that develops among three characters-- one American student and two incestuously close Parisian siblings-- did not make for an interesting character study. None of their motivations and reactions even made sense, particularly the psychotic sister who seemed to be suffering a deeper, untouchable madness that ultimately prevented her from being a part of the 'real world'."
5,Real insight to TRUTH,This is a very well written book with insight and understanding of the times in which the parts of the Bible were written. You'll gain understanding that has previously been missing in your life.
1,Highly disappointing,"I was highly disappointed with this movie. The movie's original soundtrack was changed, which takes away from the quality of the argentine actors. I recommend, do not purchase this item."
2,Propaganda...?,"None Dare Call It Treason is pulp propaganda hacked out, but it does serve an important purpose. It deftly (and inadvertently) makes a case for exactly why NOT to oversimplify arguements into good vs. evil. Besides, most of the information is simply made up.This book should be admitted into a class about the effects of propaganda when taken out of context - the ravings of someone who might've drank too much coffee at the typewriter."
1,ANTIQUE COLD WAR PROPAGANDA,"This book is nothing more than fascist cold war propaganda. According to the author, the tiny American Communist Party (thoroughly infiltrated by the FBI, I might add) and its leader Gus Hall have secretly controlled the United States for decades now. The author provides no documentation for this allegation, no verification at all, he just reads Gus Halls self important public statements, then tries to show how this proves that Gus Hall controlled some policy of the government. This book would be very funny if it were only better written."
3,Advanced Fancy Pants: an Illustrated Guide to Intermediate a,"A good book if you are interested in learning advance techniques. Some patterns available for practice. However, some may not like the untidy presentation and may find it difficult to understand. May need to read more than once to understand."
2,"Barely smells like anything, salts are slow to dissolve","These salts really don't smell like lavender and are not powerful enough to scent the tub. The salts themselves are quite large and take a very long time to dissolve, often they don't dissolve by the end of the bath. There also appear to be pieces of sand or small rocks in here. I definitely don't recommend this product, spend your money on a different brand."
4,Not a big fan of Bath Salts personally but it smelled good.,Originally I had purchased this thinking it was bath milk as that it what I typed into amazon and this is one of the products that showed up due to it having coconut milk in it. It is my own fault for not double-checking so I cannot be too hard on it.The scent is pleasant.
1,Wrong age group.,"I might have liked this better had I been twenty-five years younger, but it didn't do anything for me at this point in my life except steal two hours. It wasn't scary, the characters weren't interesting, and it wasn't original. Alien and Invaders of the Body Snatchers (any version) beat this bore all to hell."
1,A total rip-off....,"Everyone said how original this movie was. I don't think so. I liked this movie the first time....when it was called ""Class of 1999"". The Faculty totally ripped off a good movie by changing the menacing robot teachers to menacing alien teachers. I wish I could give this movie 0 stars. All I have to say about this movie is lame. Lame, lame, lame."
1,One star for special effects,"The only part of this movie worth watching is the ""pool chase"" scene...that is if you can can get beyond the idiocy of that humoungous of a ""queen"" alien hiding herself in that body. Overall shallow plotting, D-U-M-B stereoptypical characters with the blatently requisite ""cute"" factor, and too many holes on the explaining the alien (WHY didn't it just go live in our ocean? Would it have even have had a concept of landbased intelligence coming from the world it [o so briefly] described? OR a desire to conquor? ) A good movie to balance your checkbook by."
3,"Good begining, but terrible ending.","""The Facult"" is one of those movies were you wonder if they went over budget twords the end, and had to fill in the rest with not much more than a generic and predictiable ending. I must itmite that the begining is very well done, and makes you want too watch more. but farther on in you start too lose intrest. I'm a person who enjoy's a good horror movie were it dosen't show so much violence, and leaves your mind up to what hapened. In this film you see way too much. It dosen't give you that phsycalogical feeling of suspense. I would recomend this movie to someone who can stand more violence than normal."
4,Good......,This film has very good entertainment value - The overall story is pretty good as you can never really know who is what (You'll understand once you've seen it) it does keep you guessing. The visual effects are very good. Soundtrack is class. Overall it's a top quality effort and I'd say is worth buying rather than just watching
3,Entertaining....,"I think the Faculty is an average film. It's not very scary but it certainly has a strange atmosphere around it. The teachers are having strange looks on their faces and later on you don't know who is 'good' and who is 'bad'. The end of the film is a bit exaggerated, with this huge monster which I will not describe... If you want to see an entertaining movie, you can watch this film. I must say, the special effects are quite good and the film is not bad, but it could have been better with a more complete storyline."
3,i thought this movie was supposed to be horror?,this movie was kind of scary but mostly science fiction.good for fans of both of those kind of movies
3,OK Teen Gore Fest!,"While in it's essence a rip-off of Invasion of The Body Snatchers, it does mock itself. Basing itself on other much better sci/fi movies. The film is well written and with a top-notch cast, of which Jordana Brewster stands out. Film references should keep film buffs interested. Ultimately entertaining but never thought-provoking, which is an important element in a sci/fi movie, good thing it doesn't take itself to seriously. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 6!"
4,"A ripe off of Body Snatchers, but still good!","I live in Ohio, and that is the state that the Faculty was set in. It is alwasy interesting to me when movies are set in ohio, but filmed elsewhere. That aside, I really did like this movie, though it is a ripe off of many other movies. True, most will not like the very vulgar dialouge, but it is only a movie. The actors are fresh and interesting. They keep the viewer wanting more, and feeling what they feel. I recommend this movie to sci-fi/horror fans."
3,"good actors,,,,not very original on the plot","I generally like films where there is a conspiracy in the works, however this one is a little weak. The best conspiracy films have some basis in reality. This one does not. It is entertaining though.The Brewster girl is sensational(looks and acting wise). I hadnt seen her before. I was dissapointed with Elijah Wood being associated with such a weak plot. He is far too talented for the work he has been doing lately.ANYBODY could have played Casey in this film. Rent it only if you have not seen a five star movie at the store.Parents beware. This movie portrays drug use by teen idols.Keep younger kids away from it."
3,Buffy meets Aliens,"The 'Buffy' set arrived at high school, with the main characters being shown aka 'Trainspotting' style; the quiet one, the popular one, the scary one, the new one...and of course, captain of the football team. Circumstances...i.e. teachers being overtaken by alien creatures...brings them all together to try and save the school and, of course, the world. The best performance was from the high school coach...the liquid terminator in Terminator 2...that man is just scary! It was predictable throughout, until the nice littletwist at the end. A decent enough film for a Wednesday night."
5,For Concerned Parents,"This is easily one of the best movies i have ever seen. Now, of course there are parts in it that not everyone should see, but i think it is worth covering your son/daughter's eyes. Now i am a kid on their side and i was only able to see this at a friends house, so i saw the whole thing. (i am 13) In conclusion, i think that this is a very suitible movie for, lets say 10 and up. Thanks Will"
4,Typical-but good at it,"I found that while this movie did have a typical plot for a horror movie, they did a great job at keeping everything a secret. If you're looking for a good horror flick (with way too much cussing), this is for you. You do learn the plan the kids make early on, and of course it's the only way that the movie could end. However, I was surprised to discover who the queen that the kids had to defeat was. I must say that I enjoyed it though."
2,Nothing special,"There's nothing to reccomend about The Faculty. And surprisingly from the director of FROM DUSK TIL DAWN and DESPERADO it's very tame stuff. There isn't much gore, the rebellion factor is shockingly low (this is important in a movie like this) and the story is never fully developed and isn't up to much. The only thing that is good about this movie is Josh Hartnett. I think he is a very good actor and he should have been given more screen time.All you get on this non-anamporphic DVD is a trailer, Dolby 5.1 and a letterboxed picture framed at 1.82:1."
1,This Disc has MAJOR problems,"WARNING!!!This DVD can ONLY be seen in ""Widescreen"" If you have a 16x9 TV. If you're like me and still have a 4:3 ratio TV but still want to see the movie in a letterbox format your out of luck. Because of a manufacturing screw up in the disc itself you will only see a Pan & Scan Fullscreen version. I have tried this DVD on many different players and got the same result on all of them. If anyone knows of a fix for this please let me know.So to be clear16x9 TV = Widescreen Movie4:3 TV = Fullscreen Movie (Regardless of DVD player)"
3,"Good vendor, I picked a movie that was not all that great.","Movie came quick, was in great shape. Plot was really trite; not vendors fault. would use again."
5,Best alien movie of all time!!,"I like the idea of aliens taking over the school, and because it would be really cool if it happened some day."
3,"Fun, but not oscar material","The young cast was great. The adults were ordinary. The plot was hackneyed, unbelievable, but fun to watch. My teenagers and I laughed the entire time. The one thing my teenagers kept saying was that with all the public hype to discount drug-taking this particular video insists and promotes drug-taking to avoid alien possession. And if teenagers recognize the drug promotion plot, then parents should view the video with their children. Enjoy the video, laugh at the antics of the special effects, and discuss the ""drug-thing"" - its a good stepping stone to having a non-argumentative discussion about the value of not taking drugs."
4,not bad for a teenager horror film,I saw this movie on showtime not to long ago and it was actually a good horror movie. I couldn't believe it. It even had teenagers playing the parts. That is even more unbelivable. This movie is 1 in about million because it is very rare for a horror film with teenagers in it to turn out good. Not only that but it had a hot naked blonde girl towards the ending of the movie that made it that much better
2,"So We Have The 137th Remake Of ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers""","So we have another film from the guy that wrote ""Scream"", Kevin Williamson. I'm starting to think we have a ""one hit wonder"" on our hands, again. Sure, ""Scream"" was a pretty good thrill ride, but anything this guy wrote after ""Scream 2"" is pretty much a remake of everything else that has already been done. ""Cursed"" is every other werewolf movie that's already been done, why not do another ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers""? Sorry, but this film is almost decent at best. Like I said, it's just another remake with a high school twist. I don't think I'll be seeing this again any time soon."
1,It borrows and borrows,"I was shocked at how blatantly this cheesey horror film rips off it's far superior predecesors. Mainly John Carpenters THE THING. Some of the scenes are actually lifted directly from that film. A glaring example is the scene where the teacher is beheaded out in the shool parking lot. Her walking head is the exact replica of the one in The Thing.Also the scene in the one of the teens homes where they snort coke to see who is not who they pretend to be. Another direct rip off of The Thing.One more, is where the queen morphs and reveals her true self is also somewhat reminescent of The Thing. My suggestion? Leave this on the rental counter and rent a far superior horror flick called The Thing."
1,Shameful Cash-In,"Robert Rodriguez proved with ""El Mariachi"" and some of his other films that he is indeed a talented director, but what made him think that ""The Faculty"", this Body Snatchers rip-off for Generation Me, was going to work? The special effects are cheesy, the story is cliche-ridden, and the only real redeeming element is that the teenagers in this movie (who are mostly played by 20 year old actors, I might add) actually seem like realistic teenagers. Poor Rodriguez, I hope he fares better with his next movie."
4,Keeps you glued to the screen!!!,"This is an excellent teen sci-fi film. I love the way the story unfolds. The movie is about aliens that are taking over both the students and teachers bodies, hoping to eventually take over the world. I like the explanation given for the alien parasite having to drink lots of water and the reason for trying to take control the human race. I watched this whole movie one night on USA. When it was over, I wanted to see it again. I liked the way the kids from different cliches come together. Josh Hartnett as Zeke the drug dealer and Elijah Wood as the geeky kid really stood out in the movie. Clea DuVall wasn't bad either. Overall, this is a good movie to sit down and watch by yourself or even better, with your friends."
3,Pass me the water,"Not as much 'gloop' as Dusk until Dawn but with the same tongue in cheek style as Scream 2 this film is as enjoyable as it is predicatble. Yes we know that the kids will win in the end (Scooby-do style), yes we know who the monster is but the story still grips as much as it borrows its ideas from other movies. We have the walking head from The Thing (albeit this one is prettier), the band up loser/mixed-up kids from ... er ... all movies with loser/mixed-up kids in them and the is she/isn't she from ... you know the movie! This film has style, it does not take itself seriously, has some bits that will make you jump and other moments that will make you laugh. So if you find something odd on your local football field, leave it alone! (Oh and watch out for people standing out in the rain!)"
3,Not so unreal,"Although the plot has some failures, the movie is rather enjoyable. In fact, it reminds us of high school and we start to wonder where most of our teacher came from. Moreover, all the different kinds of students shown in the movie, from the nerd to the intelectual one, bring a great sense of reality. I would recommend the film for those who enjoy horror movies; the other should stay away."
3,The movie was preety cool.,I liked the actors in the movie I found that they were really cool except for Elijah Wood he was to nerdy.It wasn't the best horror movie in the world I don't even why they called it a hooror movie but I must of liked it enough to buy it so for the horror movies that I've seen I think that this is seconed to best.
4,just the better of all high school movies,well i wont say i watched this JUST for josh hartnett - wel actually i did but i was so impressed by this film it is a very cliched plot and the ending - who ends up with who is very predictable BUT you could relate to the characters and they all had their own needs and this was reflected in the film - particularly impressed with clea duVall she was good.
5,Good guilty pleasure,One of my favorite horror pictures in recent history and the blu-ray is the best presentation yet!
4,Good time fun!!,I had forgotten about this movie and recently rewatched it. It brought back so many memories! It is everything rolled into one without ever taking itself too seriously. If your looking for a movie for pure entertainment this is the movie for you.
3,got my attention,"This movie got my attention and I watched it on teevee, it had good elements of Body Snatchers, The Thing, and a little Alien and a little Terminator. The acting was very good, action was very good, I enjoyed it overall. But the happy ending of everybody coming back alive and the world being good again betrayed the viscerable horror concepts that gave birth to this movie. This was fun to watch, but the axed Pollyanna ending was very disappointing."
3,Good popcorn flick,"The Faculty didn't exactly turn heads at the box office for it's not so intriguing storyline (high school teachers turned aliens). I'm surprised that the movie was actually pretty good. The DVD blows but the movie's decent. The film follows a group of stereotype teens: the jock, the nerd, the cheerleader, the outsider, the rebel, and the new student. They uncover a conspiracy by the aliens to invade the Earth after witnessing the brutal invasion of the school nurse via her ear. This movie doesn't require an ounce of thought really because it is a popcorn movie. Kevin Williamson as usual, lays it on pretty thick with references to other movies. Robert Patrick, Famke Janssen, Bebe Neuwirth, Piper Laurie, and Jon Stewart play the teachers with Stewart in an unlikely turn for a comedian."
2,"All And All, Quite Unoriginal","The Faculty isn't completely bad really. The creature effects are pretty cool in places, but that's really the only good thing about this movie. This movie barely has a shred of originality within it. Even through all the action scenes, it still was quite dull. The acting was okay. The Faculty is quite odd and unoriginal, but it does have some nice effects, especially the creatures in the aquarium."
2,"Hey Teachers!, Leave Them Kids Alone!.","Let's start off by saying that it was a nice, fresh twist to have a teen horror film that wasn't a slasher film. I prefer the slasher ones, but this will do. Kevin Williamson from ""Scream"" and Robert Rodriguez from ""Desperado"" and ""From Dusk Til Dawn"" team up for this sci-fi/horror teen film about a bunch of high schoolers who find out that the faculty at their school have been overtaken from some outer space parasite. The one thing this film has going for it is the cast. We get a lot of great seasoned performers : Piper Laurie, Robert Patrick, Salma Hayek, Jon Stewart, Bebe Neuwirth, Famke Jenssen, and Christopher MacDonald. The kids are all good. Jordana Brewster is an instant eye catcher. Very beautiful girl. There is nothing new here, but the sharp direction and choreography, as well as the solid cast make it decent enough. Pretty average."
5,among best ones,"this is one of rare movies i went to watch twice in cinema.wonderful story,perfect cast and non-stop fun/adrenaline.you can not find more better.flawless and masterly."
2,Where exactly is the horror/sci-fi genre headed to?,"Why is it year after year we have to have horror movies with teenage stars? When was the last time we saw an actual original film that mixed comedy with horror and science fiction as The Faculty tried to? I believe it was 14 years ago to a movie called Re-Animator. That same year, two other imaginitive horror films called Day of the Dead and The Return of the Living Dead were also released. Why is it we can't have horror films as good as those three? Instead, we get an imitation of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Puppetmasters with a cast of young stars. While the acting was better than usual, nothing else was. It just seemed highly improbable that an entire town that was infected could not find six teenagers that weren't. This movie had some mildly suspenseful scenes, but overall lacked imagination, and definitely laughs."
5,I thought of this movie,"A long time ago..before this movie was ever made, I thought of a cool idea of a movie where the teachers would be aliens. I guess they beat me to it lol. There version looked alot better than what I had thought should happen. The only negiative remark I have is that I wish the DVD could have been more of a ""special edition"" becuase I remembering seeing scenes in the theatrical trailers that were not in the movie. Plus they could of done a commentary and so on. This would also be a great movie to make into infinifilm"
4,Scream meets the X-files,"The Faculty is a fine teen thriller from Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk to Dawn) and the screenplay by one of Hollywood's finest writers Kevin Williamson ('Scream', 'Scream 2' 'I know what you did last summer' and TV's 'Dawson's Creek'). When I heard that Williamson was involved with this movie I had to see it, and I was not disappointed. The Faculty is a well-made and written movie about Aliens trying to take over a school in American. The movie is hip, scary and even funny in parts and includes a fine cast of up and coming young actors. This film will appeal to fans of scream as well as fans of 'Dawson's Creek', this is a fine movie. I just hope Rodriguez and Williamson team up again!"
3,Love it....for good reasons or not,"Okay, so even though the plot was TOTALLY unoriginal, and the directing was....eh. There are three reasons why i have this video on tape. Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, and Shawn Hatosy. If it wasn't for half of the cast's looks, the whole movie would be one big bomb. I must say, that the ""F"" word was used OVER and OVER and OVER again, until any time it was even USED in a sentance the whole SENTANCE was meaningless. It was pretty good. It attacked some things that teens today have to deal with. You could punch holes through the script as if it was swiss cheese. But if you're in the mood for some movie that you'll watch because you're really really bored and you just wanna be entertained, then Faculty is perfect."
5,Great movie!,This movie is really great and i love the story and actors. Must see for any one looking for a good thriller
4,"Not very original, but still entertaining","This isn't an original concept. It's Invaders From Mars, it's The Puppet Masters, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and so on. Take that concept and add in teen angst and a good cast directed by Robert Rodriguez and you get a decent but predictable movie. This is the kind of movie that could really benefit from more female nudity. I think Rodriguez has done better, I think most of the cast has done better, but I got this for $5.99 on Blu-Ray. It's definitely worth the price and looks pretty sharp and clean on Blu-Ray. If you're looking for a cheap and good way to kill an hour and a half, this isn't too bad."
3,Decent thriller,"I did not find this movie overly scary, but it was still a nice thriller. If you've seen plenty of teen flicks, you'll notice some cliches, but I still liked this movie. It's a bit dated, but watching it on TV can be fun and a quick way to pass time."
2,OKay but Overpriced.,"I just don't get it. With all the fabulous skin care products out there, why all the fuss about this brand??? I have decided it's the packaging, the adorable boutique stores found in upscale malls, and the French name. I purchase this brand as gifts for folks I know who swear buy it, but for me I don't find it to be worth the extra $$$."
3,review,"By this means I advise Amazon that the author of ""Veinte Poemas....."" is from Chile, not Mexico. Please correct your description of the publication.J.K. Crockett"
2,I would recommend this book to my friends.,"I like the book very much because it is very interesting and . Lou Anne Johnson's style is very realistic.But I think the film is better because the scences are more . Nonetheless, I would recommend this book to my friends."
3,Dangerous Minds,"The book Dangerous Minds by Louanne Johnson was a fairly interesting book in my opinion. Mrs. Johnson, the teacher of a class full of bad students, was able to conquer what most teachers wouldn't dare to try. Mrs. Johnson showed her students that she cared and that she was not going to give up on them. The book helped me to see that even if someone is labled as a problem student that they are able to learn and achieve great things. I think that this would be good for students who have behavior problems in school, because it will show them that they can also do as good as Mrs. Johnson's class did. This book also shows the devotion that some teachers have when it comes to teaching students such as the ones in Mrs. Johnson's class. Many teachers are not willing to do what Mrs. Johnson did because they just don't care enough to want to make a change in students."
4,The lovely story about a perfect teacher...,"DANGEROUS MINDS By LouAnne Johnson shows how unorthodox teaching methods can help students to find their own personality and to respect themselves. LouAnne Johnson encourages them to live their dreams and to never give up. She tells her story with a lot of humor and describes the problems that teachers face in American high schools. I wish there were more teachers like LouAnne Johnson, who really care about their students. She teaches them what's really important for life, and exactly this IS the job of a teacher. I recommend this book to every teacher hoping that many of them will follow LouAnne Johnson's example. At least I wish to add that in my opinion the book is far better than the Hollywood picture. It's much more interesting and worth reading."
2,"Decent book, but the justification was a bit much","The book was well written and captivating. However, the author's constant justification of what she was doing and constant putting down of those who disagreed with her hurt the book tremendously. I understand wanting to look good, but she carries it too far."
1,a disappointing book,"I am about to send the book back, for the following reasons : - a large part of the book is not concerned with food, but is an account of the author's travels. I think the presentation of the book should have made this clear. - Many recipes rely on meat substitutes. It has always struck me as the sign of a sad lack of imagination when vegetarian food tries to mimick meat-based cooking. It is particularly regrettable when one writes about Turkish cuisine, which has some of the most delicious NATURALLY vegetarian dishes."
4,Turkish Cooking - A Culinary Journey Through Turkey,It's a good book it brings me back to some great family recipes from my Nana. I wish it had more pictures! Its one forth tour of turkey and three forth recipes.
2,Filled with facts completely undocumented,"I find this book incredibly irritating, in that I can read a sentence; it makes perfect sense, and then I realize -- HOW do people know that? Why should I believe it? There are no sources cited, no primary sources quoted. The book tells me that ""...the Pilgrims were less committed to grand designs, less concerned about how they were viewed by others, than the Puritans who settled the larger and more ambitious English colonies to their north."" How do people know this? Are there written records? If so, why aren't they quoted? Or why, at least, are they not cited so I can go look them up? I might even be happy to have a secondary source cited. But as it is, I have no reason to believe any of what it says... If I wrote a history paper like this, my teachers would give me a zero, and I would deserve it."
3,Guru Guru - 'In The Guru Lounge' (Revisited),"Came out just a few years ago, as this was an all-new Guru Guru CD. I guess when you're around as LONG as Guru Guru has been - you will obviously want to 'try' something new every now and then. As does Mani Neumeier and crew does here on 'In The Guru Lounge'. Long time fans NEED to keep in mind that this disc is indeed a far cry from anything the band has ever done before. With that in mind, you should be able to get something from this disc. Tracks that I thought sort of maybe showed some promise were ""Read Air"", the jazzy ""Kleines Pyjama"", the upbeat - yet a bit out-there ""Bo Altai"" and the bonus cut ""Mexikaner"" which is Guru Guru dabbling with Mexican music. Talk about a first timer. Have to admit that most of this CD does throw me off quite a bit. Only way I could possibly describe it is as 'Loungedelic'. Might be ideal for open-minded and bored progressive and krautrock fans."
5,Watch It!,"I love the plot, the characters, and the setting for this film. I am an English teacher, so this film speaks to my heart. It is good to see Robin Williams in this role of a caring teacher. Watch it, and love it!"
1,Need a sleep aid?,"I really don't know what all the hype has been about. I kept hearing all these great things about this movie, so I eagerly anticipated watching it. Although Robin Williams gave his usual great performance, I was unable to connect to any of the main group of teenagers. I was also greatly disappointed in the fate of one and then the repercussions that creates on Robin Williams character. There is probably alot of really deep things I didn't catch since poetry is usually too obscure for me. Another reviewer thought the ending was brilliant - I really saw no value in that final moment. I certainly did not finish the movie with a good feeling, I felt quite relieved it was over."
1,"Um this movie is the most made up, lame excuse for a movie","ok the plot: a group of kids sneak out of their boarding school and read poetry. Now what realism is this. The kids risk the future of their lives, and risk getting caught and thrown out of school for what? To read useless items of peotry? What idiot kids what do this? My point exactly. NOONE. Its not to get food, or to try to steal money to get out of the school, its to read poetry. That is by far the most retarded plot ever made. I admit, some parts where funny, but the plot is ridilusly stupid, and so far-fetched, that watching makes you think how stupid the characters are. My advice to you, do not rent, by, or plain watch this film ever. Watch it if you wish to be bored out of your mind. If you want to talk to me about this movie, insant messege me on yahoo messenger at the name: ujio_last_samurai"
4,"Oh, to be Young and Starry-Eyed!","4 1/2 starsIn Dead Poets Society, Robin Williams is given a role allowing him to do what he does (or used to, pre-Patch Adams) best -- be Robin Williams. In a role that got him a richly deserved best actor Oscar nomination, he shares the stage with a gifted troupe of young actors (most notably Robert Sean Leonard, who was up for best supporting actor), one actress, and some seasoned veterans. Williams plays an inspirational, idealistic teacher at a boys' boarding school. The historically accurate film, set in 1959, juxtaposes the liberating content with the authoritarian structure of a ""humanist"" education, and the tragic consequences that inherent conflict can result in. Australian director Peter Weir proves yet again, that he is at home on either side of the Pacific."
4,GOOD!,"This probably was one the last good movies that features Robin Williams. The only weak point is that the School's Administration is portrayed almost as Masters of Evil, totally one-sided history.! But the general effect is good and I know quite a few people that had tears in their eyes at the extremely melodramatic ending!"
2,"A Dull, Plodding un-Williams-like Film","I realize I am going against popular culture on this one, but ""Dead Poet's Society"" has to be one of the worst ""high-brow"" films ever made. I never understood its popularity on release, and years later, on second viewing, still believe that neither its plot nor its characters really end up saying much of anything. Instead, they stand around sounding serious, and Williams tries his best to make the whole thing somehow palpable. He doesn't succeed. Skip this poor excuse for a ""thinking person's"" film and stick to movies with a real message, if that's what you're looking for. Robin Williams fares far better in other less wordy flicks like ""Mrs Doubtfire"" and ""Good Morning Vietnam."""
1,"A terrible, depressing epic.","This movie was terrible! The whole premise, centered in a boy's school, where some boys decide to ""live life to the fullest"" has nearly nothing to do with the story! The whole mess of a movie is filled with STUPID symbolic meanings, horrid quotes, and loathable characters. Robin Williams is, as he is in many other of his movies, a dork. He is supposed to be an inspirational character, but has many out of character events, including an impersination of Marlon Brando. The Dead Poets society is a side theme, which is poorly planned and clumsily executed. The ending is also exceedingly depressing and grim (and stupid.) One character dies, one is expelled, and Mr. Keating is drummed out of the school, justly. A real upper, this movie needs no explaination for it, only an apology."
3,A mediocre Robin Williams movie,"""Dead Poets Society"" wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. It got better as it went on is what I should also add. I am a great fan of Robin, but I rather enjoy his comedy better like ""Toys"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"". I can see why a lot of people love his drama too. This was ALRIGHT. It kind of got better, but then it was not as good but it had a worthful ending to it. Need I say anymore? In conclusion, Robin Williams teaching a few boys poetry in his own way is not as good as Robin Williams as a toy maker or a ironic housekeeper. Although, I CAN see why this film is loved so much. Drama for me is good every once in a while. {Actually, I think Robin Williams has been in more dramas than comedy because I also think he got some award for ""Good Will Hunting"", but I am not really interested in seeing that}.Comedy or fantasy is more of my style."
2,very average,aside from Robin Williams this film is very boring&dull.the film has no Personality whatsoever.this kind of film has been done countless times in different ways.
2,Good Acting . . . And That's About It.,"The acting in this movie was amazing. I could truly believe the characters--and not just Robin Williams, either. Unfortunately, that's about all there is to be said for this movie. It starts off rather promising, in a strict New England private school, but goes downhill from there. Robin Williams plays John Keating, an English Lit teacher who also teaches his students to ""Carpe Diem--Seize the Day!"" with disasterous results. Those ""disasterous results"" were the one high point in the movie. It seems like Weir, the director, tried to stretch about thirty minutes material into a two hour movie. In other words, it was really boring. Until the end, where all the ""loose ends"" in the movie climax into a disaster worthy of Shakespeare. Unfortunately, this disaster lasts about ten minutes, and suddenly you find yourself looking at credits scrolling across the screen.The bottom line: fast foward to the last ten minutes of the movie and you should be fine."
1,Sickeningly awful.,"The only thing more nauseating than Robin William's overacting & pointless impressions and improvisations is the presentation of suicide as something noble and heroic. Having lost someone to suicide, this is the most disgusting, cowardly, and selfish act a human being can commit. I was hoping that ""Heathers"" finally killed off the ignorant sentiment of ""self-sacrifice."" Sadly, I was wrong. It also seems that Robin Williams is re-hashing this role in his lastest dud, ""Patch Adams."""
5,The Battle of Individual versus Society,"As a teacher in a boys school, Mr Keating (Robin Williams) encourages his students to express themselves through poetry. They find liberation to varying degrees, and exhibit behavior that sometimes goes beyond accepted borders. Triumph and tragedy follow. The main message I got from the film is that society will punish nonconformity, yet the individual must take the risk in order to grow and find fulfillment. After watching DPS for the first time in 1990, I promised myself to watch it at least once a year for the rest of my life. It's that good. If your goal in life is to please everyone and not cause trouble, by all means don't watch it... or, maybe you should."
5,Truly inspirational!,"As an educator, this movie is the most inspirational I have ever seen! In college I had the great fortune of having a professor like Mr. Keating. Now in my classroom, I try to reach out to my students in a similar way. Carpe diem!"
3,To be or not to BE -,"I watched this film in my mid 20's and honestly, I don't feel it's appropriate viewing for 12 year olds as an educational tool. Non conformity of any kind is great until you graduate from college and go to work in a very large organization. And then it is ""conform, conform, conform."" I've watched our college grads choke this down and it is yet - AGAIN - another difficult rite of passage for them. ""But management doesn't listen."" ""They don't care what we think."" Yes, seize the day, of course seize the day - until you go to work? Non conformity is only valued in certain places and points. Can a 12 year old child really make that distinction when watching this film? OF COURSE NOT. How very romantic, yes - to set up our children to be punished for it later down the road, depending on where life lands them. But hey, keep that national deficit going - don't let the indebtedness climb off our back. Then you might really be able to value non conformity?"
4,joshuatree77,"A timeless inspiration for teachers who want to ""color outside the lines,"" to engage and interest their students in their material. Spot-on, sensitive and funny story-telling by Robin Williams again!"
3,Liked it the first time,"I thought it was a decent film and I know a lot of people really like this film. I did too at first. But as I watched it more, I began to question the plot. You mean to say that these boys were never told to make the most of their lives. And that it took one teacher to utter one (now an annoying cliche) latin phrase and 30 lives were changed that instant. The ending also seems to be forced, a shot in which it appears as if the director is trying to get this scene into a list that might be called the most-memorable movie scenes. It just doesn't seem appropiate."
4,Seize this dvd,"This is one excellent movie! I am usually very picky with movies so when I write about it u know its good.This movie had so much power,heart,feeling and really made you want to chase your dreams.All the actors were terrific and very convincing.This was a movie you did not want to end it is a classic that will inspire many for years to come.It makes you want to call up that old friend that you havent spoken to in years.Its great when you watch a good movie but when you feel it thats when you know its more than a movie its genius.Thats what this is.So enough reading go and buy it if you havent already."
2,This film has a common story.,"This film is mindly enjoyable. In this film, Mr.Keeting said to his students this phrase; ""carpe diem"". This is a Latin phrase which means ""seize the day"". I interpreted this word that do your best for your dream each day. The students were influenced by the phrase and began to act. But their act was oppressed by various things, for example, their scool and parents. Some of them got better, but finally, one of them commited suiside ... This film shows the sternness of reality simultaneously with the importance of doing one's best. But after all, the story is not uncommon."
1,"the DVD is defective, wouldn't play","the DVD is defective and wouldn't load. Never watched it. I was looking forward to it but, too bad. oh well."
2,Amazing...,"...amazingly stupid that is.Robin Williams has so much more potential than this. This is one of the most boring movies that I have seen in my life. I gave it two stars for the wonderful scene of 'carpe diem, sieze the day'. That was the best part in the movie. I couldn't even finish Dead Poets Society. Sorry, I'm not that patient."
4,"Groundbreaker with big stars, not aging very well","This movie was intensely powerful to me when I first saw it in the theaters. I thought carpe diem was a novel thought, and I shared the triumphs and anguish of the young protagonists. But I don't think this once-moving drama has aged particularly well; maybe my own outlook is what has changed, but the rich, high-spirited boys seem less sympathetic to me now, and I find some of the dramatic moments to be absolutely cheesy. There's a little bit of Porky's and a little bit of School Ties in this one. But this will always be remembered as Williams' most acclaimed role, and is still a strong film-just not as strong as it was before it was joined by a large field of copycats (most recently, and perhaps most obviously, Mona Lisa Smile)."
4,Very good film,"We had to watch Dead Poets Society in our Cinema class and it was pretty good film. Robin Williams does a great performance as a teacher who's showing his students about being creative and Original yet a very smart and moving film I must say(I think that's what his role was in part of the film, I haven't seen this in awhile). I thought Dead Poets Society was a pretty good film with good actors, pretty good story and some pretty sad moment(mainly near the end of the film).Good film...4 out of 5"
4,Review of Dead Poets' Society,"The film ""Dead Poets' Society"" was very interesting for me. It showed a very conservative boarding school in the USA in the 50s. It was a very difficult life for the students. Today the students have more rights than in the past. The actors played the roles of Mr. Keating, Neal and his friends very well."
4,My Opinion,"What caracters and scenes were you most interested in? I was most interested in Mr.Keating and the last scene. Mr.Keating had own world,loved poems and taught them to his students under his motto.He did extraordinary things that the other teachers couldn't do.So the students were interested in poems or his class ,and became to like him.However,the other teachers critisized the way of his teaching.I wish I could meet a teacher like Mr.Keating. I particularly liked the last scene because I was moved what Todd said. I was surprised that Todd,who had been shy,took the lead,and other students followed his action.And Mr.Keating replied to his students. Perhaps this film showed us the importance of relationship between teachers and students,and of spending each day enjoyable."
4,"Tremendous film, but...","it's hard for me to drum up a 5 star rating for a movie about a bunch of spoiled, pampered prep school boys who have nothing but opportunity laid at their feet. That's not to say that the rich and sheltered don't have problems like the rest of us but I don't think that they compare, by and large.That notwithstanding, it is a marvelous film with great performances from all the players. I was particularly impressed with both Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke who really brought life to their characters. And all I can say about Robin Williams is that he is as fine a dramatic actor as he is a comedian.I guess I also think the film angered me because Mr. Keating (Robin Williams) was such a fabulous teacher but as is so often the case anyone outside of the traditional faces tremendous challenges. But that's just what our educational system and society need. Non traditional thinking.Inspiring, comic, and dramatic all at the same time."
4,"What a wonderful word ""Carpe Diem"" is!","In the country side of New England. Mr. Keating (Robin Williams) teaches at one of the preparatory schools. He teaches poetry in a different way which impresses his students. One of his students, Neil, restarts the ""Dead Poets Society"" in which Mr. Keating used to belong. Members seem to enjoy themselves through reading the poetry their point of view changes a lot. Mr. Keating has his own ideals such as untraditional teaching. We think that he's very important teacher to his students. The scene which one of characters, Todd, makes a poem in front of all other students during Mr. Keating's class was most interested. For we could see his mind changing bit by bit. Perhaps this film shows us that we should find the way which we want to go. This film makes us impressed so much, and we enjoyed a lot. We'd like to recommend this film to those who are in the same generation as we. This film is one of our favorite ones ever."
4,Very Good -- Better without Robin Williams?,"DPS is a very good film--emotional and surprisingly literate for a Disney/Touchstone effort. The performances of Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, et al. are really what carry one through the film and give it resonance and it is a shame that the promo material (and, in fact, most of these reviews) center on the somewhat less-than-perfect performance by Robin Williams. Not that he's really awful, but he seems even more out of place than he perhaps should. With the DVD Widescreen version, you get to see all of the beautiful color- and light- saturated surroundings, and the nicely framed images of groups of students. So that's nice. Just wish that Disney/Touchstone could provide a few more ""extras"" than a few language selections."
5,excellent for the whole family,We shared this with our three boys ages 12-8 they loved it!! We live in Delaware which made it even more special
4,Great movie,I highly recommend this movie to everyone - of any age group. The movie is about 2 hours long but it's defo worth the time :)
4,Wonderful movie!,"Dead Poets Society, along with others such as The Breakfast Club, are the kind of movies I wish were of my generation. I was only a few years old when DPS came out but it had the same impact as if I had seen it in theatres in 1989. It's one of those movies where you watch it and come out wondering why all teachers aren't like Robin Williams' character. Dead Poet Society is the perfect combination of passion, friendships, and fun, while still having time for tears (though the DVD is somewhat lacking because of scene cuts). If you haven't seen it, I suggest that you should!"
2,Seize the day!,"This is""Dead Poets Society"".It took place on east@`merica in 1959.I think this story has a lot of relationships between the characters.And opinion gap between the boys and families leaves on impression on my mind.Because,a boy(Neil) has a dream in the future but his father is against it.And his father forces his opinions on his son(Neil).I think this is not a good thing,his father should have tried to understand his son's way of thinking and give help. I think this story is sometimes boring(for me),because it is a little difficult.But I recommend you because I was impressed by some scenes. I particulary liked the last scene because the students stand on the desk and they show that they respect their teacher.Though I couldn't understand all the words(because of English),I was very impresses by the last scene."
2,"A movie made about 'Carpe Diem', Still interested?","Of all the ideas and topics movies can be created from and they chose ""Carpe Diem"". (By the way, the two stars were for Mr. Williams.) The rest is history."
5,They could be artists...,"This movie provides startling evidence for the failure of the conservative orthodox approach towards teaching art. This movie reminds me of one of Richard Wagner's great music-dramas ""Die Meistersinger"", which is also about the struggle of the creative process. I do not feel the students had a clue about what it meant to be artists (poets) until they finally, at the end of the movie, stood on the top of their chairs in defiance while ""captain, my captain"" left the school. Anyone with children who have an interest in their kids becoming musicians, poets, painters, etc, should watch this movie!"
5,Dead Poets Society was great!,"This film,Dead Poets Society was about Mr.Keating who taught poets and his student's story.The main characters are Mr.Keating,Neil,Knox and so on.The most interesting scene for me was last scene.Parhaps this film showed us that ""Seize the day"", it is important to do what you want to do and children are not their parent's belongings. I enjoyed the film,however, I wanted Neil to left his house and chase his dream. If there were many teachers like Mr.Keating,students could have alive activity.Their acting was great! I like Mr.Keating and Todd,because Mr.Keating is adult,but he doesn't forget pure mind,and Todd's smile is very cute like a boy.I want to recommend this film to other people,especially adult,and I want them to understand and recognize children's feeling and thought."
5,Excellent!,"This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever watched, and the most heart-wrenching. Most of the movie I had a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes, and the only reason I din't cry then and there was because I was watching it in school with my class, and I did do some good crying when I was alone. An excellent movie, great acting, 99999 stars! (And for you ladies- even though I know he's too old for me, the actor palying Neil is real cute!"
5,What to Say About this Film that Hasn't Been Said Before?,"Watching this film several times is like coming back to an old friend and enjoying their company. Yes, it is sentimental; yes, its moral scheme is heavily weighted in favor of Robin Williams' towering central performance; but it nonetheless offers an object lesson in how educators should learn to work in class. Learning is not a matter of just passing on information, but needs to be a collaborative venture, inspiring learners as well as involving educators. If unorthodox means are necessary, then educators should be prepared to use them. I have been two decades in the pedagogic profession, and I have to say that DEAD POETS SOCIETY provides a regular means of reminding myself of the importance of renewal; of changing one's classroom technique to keep the material - and the methods of learning - fresh."
3,Thin -- essentially formulaic and predictable --,"though I suppose it impresses those who aren't readers of poetry, and haven't before this been exposed to the ancient fact that education can encourage creativity and critical thinking, and that conservative forces are invariably arrayed against that happening.As for Robin Williams, we can probably thank the director that he is less obnoxious than usual."
3,A Good Drama,"this movie was okay it wasn't bad it was'nt good. but in the middle. itis slow but the story was good. Robin williams was awesome in this movie. Dead poets society actually has a good moral to it's story think for your self, if you can."
2,Am I the only one who saw a it as a male version of. . .,"THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BROADIE?1. Free spirited teacher in a stuffy school. Check.2. Teacher's students (or a special corps or clique of them) adore teacher. Check.3. Teacher frequently locks horns with conservative administrator. Check.4. One of the students in the clique takes the teachers ideas too seriously, with tragic results. Check.The main difference is that (see title) DPS is set in a boys' school rather than a girls' school."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Dead Poets Society tells the story of an iconoclastic teacher who teaches his students to love him; meandering and poorly-written, it's a mediocre movie with laughable scenes (e.g. the most pretentious suicide ever shot) and stereotyped characters."
2,"Ordered new, received used.","I ordered this DVD, paying a little more because I wanted a NEW one, not used. It arrived in a case wrapped in plastic that was definitely NOT factory sealed- it looked like someone used a cheap wrapping machine. And the DVD had scratches on it. If I had wanted a USED one, I would have ordered it that way. Didn't bother to return it, because it still works. But I won't order from Movie Mars again- they obviously use false advertising."
2,Dead Poets Society,"Dead Poets Society was very difficult story for me. This story is a conflict of opinion between Neil and his parents. And main situation is a preparatory school. It has a hard and hard rules. It is very formal story. And also, I think this film's contents are very common. It is boring. But I like a teacher, Mr.Keating, beacause he has a unconventional way of thinking. I feel sympathy with him. He always think of importance of freedom and ""seize the day""."
5,great movie,I wanted the movie to have sub titles in spanish so that is what is so great about this edition
4,Carpe Diem!!,"The film, ""Dead Poets Society"" is about the relationship between Mr. Keating, the Latin teacher and his students in a preparatory school in America. Mr. Keating influences his students and they gradually become creative. Neil, the main student wants to be an actor. However, he can't say waht he really wants to do to his parents, and there is a tragedy in the end. I particularly liked the last scene when Mr. Keating is kicked out of school. All the students stand up on their desks to show their apologizes to Mr. Keating, because they can't save him. I leaned not to give up and try my best from Mr. Keating. I liked this film not only the story but also the setting. The school is located in the countryside in America. It is filled with nature. It is really beautiful when it snows. I recommend this film to people who have a dream to be a teacher and also who are interested in beautiful nature."
3,Packs a Decent Punch,"The good news is that Cowboy Mouth delivers a walloping good performance. The bad news is that the sound quality is not that great, and vocals and instruments sometimes sound muffled or off mike. There are some clever tunes, sort of like a poor-man's Bare-naked Ladies, some rough edges, lots of cynicism (apparently, the drummer, vocalist, and lead personality Fred LaBlanc just went through a d-i-v-o-r-c-e), and plenty of energy. Light It on Fire and Son of an Engineer are my favs, though it sort of depends what kind of mood one is in. It's also interesting to note that many of these tracks appear on this earlier live recording before they ended up on later studio sessions.Still, the band is clearly having fun, playing off one another and the crowd, and interjecting typical between-songs banter. With used copies available from under two bucks, one could do worse."
3,Luck of the Draw,"Abigail Butler hopes to find a new life in Montana, although to do so she must live a half lie. When she encounters Beau McMasters, the young woman begins to wish she could live the truth, but fear holds her back. Loving Abby may be the biggest gamble this man has ever taken, but it will also have the biggest payoff.*** Although the conflict in this book seems to be a bit forced and contrived, Abby and Beau's sweet story is one that has a certain charm. ***Amanda Killgore"
3,Abby's Secret,"Abby with a new surname is on the run. She must get away because Pinkerton and someone else are looking for her. She musters all her courage and leaves on the stage for Montana, that should be far enough away. Along her trip she encounters Beau and romance is in the air. Living a lie doesn't work because her past catches up with her. She has no choice be to confess to Beau. Beau has his own secret. This is a fast moving story. By Ruth Thompson the author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
5,"Sophia: Goddess of Wisdom, Bride of God","I am so sorry I didn't read this book sooner. Caitlin Matthews has more information on Sofia than I could of hoped for. Bless her for sharing her knowledge. An excellent read, destined to be a classic if not already. Truly a book for all women. Thank you Caitlin Matthews."
3,The Cathars,This book covers Heresy as proclaimed by the Roman Catholic Church in the years 1095 to ca 1235. The Albiginians in Southern France and Northern Italy are chastised by the Popes in this era. A Crudade is sent to this area where 5000 people were burned at the stake for what they believed. They believed there was a God of Good and a God of Evil.Other heresies are mention and described.
4,Fantastic Day-time cologne,"Something about this EDT just sticks to my skin like glue. I'm a boilermaker from Australia, I put this stuff on at 6am to go to work, welding with fumes everywhere all day, sweating in 40 degree Celcius heat. Come home at 5pm and still smell good, that is really worth something. Its not overbearing, just crisp and sharp. Excellent value for money."
4,Chrome; This is good stuff!,"I can pretty much sum this up in a few words. I often get comments about how good I smell. ""Ooh! You smell good!"" even my daughters tell me, ""Daddy, you smell good."" This fragrance is smooth. It is cool in the summer and warm in the winter. It is the most consistant fragrance for me to date. I would say, that is why this recent purchase was probably my 6th bottle. I recommend!"
1,Strong smell = migraine headache,"My son has this cologne and even when he only uses one or two squirts of the stuff it's way too strong and the scent lingers in the air for over 30 minutes overpowering everything else. I've taken to hiding the stuff because it gives me migraine headaches - massive pain, nausea, bad taste in my mouth...nasty.If you want to overpower your date's perfume (or if you want to make everyone around you tell you, ""Man, you put on too much cologne."")and give her a headache and stomach ache (because you despise her) then use this cologne. If not...please, for the love of all that is holy...do not buy or use this stuff!!!! It's AWFUL."
4,Great! Please respond to this :),"Great smell, long lasting, however... not strong enough. I find myself having to use 5 sprays before it is noticeable. Respond to this if anyone has any recommendations!Areas sprayed: Front and back of neck, on the top of head (hair), and both forearms.Any tips on where I should spray and how much?"
1,Great but wait...,"I think this cologne is a solid buy any time. I have used it before and it lasted well but the last bottle I got from Amazon must have been old or simply fake because it does not last at all!! I plan to buy another bottle from a trusted source just to compare because this product is definitely substandard. I'll be asking for a refund once I get the good product to compare. I cannot even get out of the house before there's barely a trace of it on me!! Needless to say, I stopped using it until I get this resolved."
3,Men's parfum...Chrome by Azzaro,"Wonderful scent for summer months--light and fresh. However not long lasting and often accompanied by that after scent (this is not a technical term) which reveals a high percentage of alcohol.Overall, refreshing."
3,Very subtle fragrance with poor longevity,This fragrance is very nice. It does however lacks in longevity and projection.It is best used during a summer/spring period in my opinion. My biggest preference always goes to a fragrance which is not only good but also lasts at least 6-8hours and this one doesn't even come close.Anyways just my 2 cents
1,They sold me water on the name of perfume,"i was fooled by earlier reviews on this product.I was not sure if i wanted to buy perfume on amazon, but some how got carried away by reviews and price on this item.I was shocked to see the Mfg date of this product when i received it :01/12/07, this product was made 5years before. I used it and its just like sprinkling water no smell. Now i understand how they can sell these items at this price.Get them from any bigger store"
3,thick and strong smell,"It was ok. The smell of it is more ""thick and strong"" instead of like the other cologne's which the smell is more ""sharp and sweet"" if you know what I mean? The smell, not really my preference."
5,"Girlfriend loves it, lasts awhile","I've been using this for a few years now. Girlfriend loves it, and a bottle this size lasts me over a year, using 1-2 sprays a day."
5,"Great, my wife loves the smell",My wife and I both live the smell. My Marine son started wearing it andI tried some. He said its the cologne of the Marines.
5,Chrome for Men,I'm always being asked by other women why my husband always smells so good. This cologne is really the best smelling on the market as far as I'm concerned.
4,Elegante Metálico,"Esta fragancia es acuática-metálica un poco fuerte al principio pero conforme avanza se torna elegante, fresca y hasta un poco sensual, no me gustaba al inicio pero si es bastante agradable."
2,No free shipping from AAAMerchants,"I ordered the Chrome By Azzaro For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray tester from AAAMerchants and although the price had free shipping when I got to the cart I was charged shipping!! wtf?? Contacted seller AAAMerchants and seller AAAMerchants claimed it was Amazons glitch (fault). They still havent changed the ""free shipping"" claim on the product description. Get with it AAAMerchants"
4,Brazilian electronica takes on old-fashioned forro,"A weird, modernized take on the ""forro"" music of Luiz Gonzaga, who had his heyhay in the 1940s, '50s and '60s. This modern collection features a few well-known artists (such as Nana Vasconcelos and Nacao Zumbi), along with a slew of Brazil's most creative electronica artists. The typical accordion-and-triangle sound of forro is stripped apart and slathered with skittery jungle, ambient dub and techno riffs, rendering it all but unrecognizable. The results are weird, challenging and delightful. The only one of these artists I've heard of before is Otto -- all these other young'uns are a revelation. Definitely worth checking out!"
5,Old Cheyenne a great Roy Rogers Cowboy movie.,"The Roan group did a great job restoring this film. We've watched both Heldorado and Old Cheyenne and Old Cheyenne is the better of the two movies. Why, more of a clear western. The movie is set in Wyoming, but it's pretty clear that it was shot on the same set as most of the Roy Rogers movies out near Josha Tree National Park. Roy owned some property now called ""Pioneer Town"" and shot a lot of movies out here. Gabby Hayes is great as the geezer who does right. Seems like everybody learned to shoot at ""the storm trooper sharpshooter academy"" (ie. even with a rifle no one seems to be able to hit anything smaller than the broad side of a barn. But it's all in good fun until the house catches fire and the boys have to make a run for it. If you like Roy Rogers films, you'll like this set."
2,Warning: This is not a blues CD,"Don't let the title confuse you. This is not a blues CD. Its country. Tab Benoit writes in the liner notes this is a ""special project"" of all of his ""early musical influences"" ""especially early country music.""It's well recorded. It has some nice music. It has fiddles, banjos and pedal steel guitars. But it isn't a ""brother to the blues."" It's only a distant cousin."
3,"Interesting, if not misleading title!","Tab Benoit is one of my favorite blues artists and I particularly like it when he mixes the blues with a little Cajun flavor from the Bayou. That being said, I was taken by surprise at the lack of blues on this release. The CD consists of mostly hillside country music complete with pedal steel, banjo and fiddle. Something tells me that if he titled this recording to reveal its true contents, sales would be somewhat dismal. Tab's tip of the hat to the songs which he knew as a child will be better appreciated by some country fans but, it is sure to leave blues fans a little unsatisfied. Especially knowing that we may have to wait another year or two for a suitable new release."
4,Lots of fun,"Good premise, good action and a great ending. Remember - don't mess with the Roman Empire."
5,A great book and a magnificent vocational test,"SICP is an excellent, perhaps the best, advanced introduction to computer science and programming. It covers topics such as functional abstraction, data abstraction, OOP, program design, constraint programming and logic programming, always from a language design point of view. You will need a decent mathematical background to follow it.If it's such a great textbook, then why half of the reviewers hate it? Elementary: SICP is not just a textbook, it's also a Computer Science aptitude and vocational test. If you read it and like it, then Congratulations! You are a real programmer and computer scientist, with hair on your chest. If you don't like it, then you should be studying something else. Law, mortuary science, whatever, but not CS."
3,What is your purpose for reading this book?,"If your school uses this book as a text of a certain introductory cs course that you have to get a ""good"" grade for, you definitely want to have some help to understand it in such a short time. That is, at most, a 16 week semester.On the other hand, if you really want to explore the world of programming on your time and on your own pace, it is the ultimate source of programming magic.Some people from MIT and UC Berkeley say these wonderful things about this book, yet they areonly true when you are really after the knowledge not the grade."
5,Most difficult programming book I've ever read,"This book is, in a word, challenging. I'm a Computer Science student and this is the most difficult book I've ever read. For example, there's no FOR or WHILE loops used in this book. All loops use recursion. As you go on with this book, the programs tend to get larger and larger, because it builds on programs introduced previously, and at some point it's hard to keep track of them. This book uses the language Scheme, which I believe has no practical use, yet it is a good language for your programming skils (such as recursion), and it's an interactive language, too, which means I don't have to compile every time after I modify my codes. Let me warn you again, this book is very challenging. If you're not ready for it or have bought it and found it difficult, may I suggest Simply Scheme by Brian Harvey. My CS class uses SICP as the textbook, and many of my fellow classmates also bought Simply Scheme as an aid."
3,Not for learning unless ...,"I love this book. It's fun to read the things I already know, put together in such an interesting way. If you have 10 years serious experience as a computer programmer, and love programming, this book is for you. (Five stars.)However, I really bought it to see how the masters teach introductory programming. They don't, unless maybe you have a SAT score of 1500+, an IQ of 170++, and are an MIT student being taught by someone who knows and loves this book. Otherwise, don't touch it! There are better things to do with the money: burn it, give it to the rich, or buy drugs from a narc. (One star.)"
1,Poorly written,"Regardless of what you think is useful computer knowledge, this book does a bad job of presenting its topics. Especially for beginners, this book is very frustrating. The first few chapters often employ obscure mathematical tricks as examples of how the computing concepts can be applied. In the end, the reader doesn't see the forest for the trees and tries to figure out the math just to understand what the code samples are doing. Other parts of the book either mention in passing, or devote very little space to interesting ideas, and instead devote pages and pages to something fundamental, to the point that it gets very boring. Finally, I personally think this book is poorly organized. The first four chapters try to focus on maximum abstraction, and the last chapter presents a totally oposing view of computers--as register machines...which is a completely different paradigm. This confuses many people.I'd give this book zero stars if I could."
1,Scheme ruins everything,"If looked upon as a reference, this book isn't all that bad. There are some interesting concepts here. Few, thought--most of the stuff is self evident. Also, I really think them using Scheme was a big mistake. A book of this caliber should not concern itself with specific languages, true, and they could have done two things: use a syntactically simple language, or ignore any specific language all together and use pseudocode. They chose the former, and that's too bad. Scheme is totally inappropriate for these kinds of complicated things. My other gripe with the title is that it doesn't go in depth into any one topic. Just a bunch of concepts thrown at you and briefly explained. The book migh serve well as a reference, but it definitely isn't for beginners, as it claims to be, and it definitely won't teach you programming. Most of the material here is curious, but hardly relevant to you if you've never programmed before."
1,cryptic and uninteresting,"This book is good to read when you have trouble falling asleep. Everyone I know, including the professor, were often confused. In the end, he abandoned the book and started teaching from his own notes, and learning Scheme and the concepts became a pleasure. The problem is the author, who thinks that because he's from MIT, he can just write drivel and it will sell. Everything in this text can be explained much more clearly and precisely if done by a good teacher. But the book makes no such effort, and as a result, it's boring and often difficult to understand. If you really want to learn the foundations of programming, buy a book by Knuth, for instance. SICP, though, is probably the worst, most arrogant and pompous text on programming, but it teaches nothing."
1,...,"If you read books carefully and try to understand their meaning, you'll be frustrated by this text.If you read 'popular' books as a 'trophy' collection activity and don't think about content...this book is for you. It's from MIT..all the prestige you need in one little text...who cares about the actual conent?Those who do care, stay away. Some of the most fundamentally important material is gathered here and butchered in the most horrific way. I suggest you look at specific books on topics such as hardware design, compilers, etc...this book will only cause pain and won't explain them."
1,a very painfull process,"I originaly was introduced to this book in college by a teacher who said the text would open heretofore unknown vistas to me. It was supposed to turn me into a deeply understanding computer scientist, and not just a code monkey. I found out those promises didn't come true. Two semesters later I was feeling lucky to have finally finished the course, and was angry to have wasted so much time. This book quite simply doesn't deliver what it promises. Instead, it tries to be as coprehensive as possible, covering so many topics that I was dizzy, but it does a very bad job of explaining anything in detail. The end result is that I learned nothing. Apparently the authors believe quantity is better than quality. In any case, you won't get anything out of that text...and it certainly won't make you a better computer scientist, though it pretends to. Don't waste your time and money."
5,Programming Zen,"It is a great book for the serious student. I spent much of the read-time visualizing the excellent concepts. When I finished this book, I was able to easily learn and effectively use several languages. (VB, Java, VBScript, JScript, Perl, C++)It is very import to understand that programming is not just understanding the language, but how to use it effectively. ~ Just because you know how to speak & spell in English that doesn't mean you are great writer... This book will help you become a great writer (programmer)."
1,Not terribly interesting,"I can't say this book is absolutely horrible, but it isn't good either. I read it on the advice of some guy who liked it, but I didn't. The breadth and wealth of topics discussed is staggering, but none of them are treated especially well, and some seemed hardly of any relevance. I still think the way they presented structures such trees and lists, with pairs, is a very braindead approach. C style pointers are much more intuitive and flexible. Aside from that, this text might be OK as a simple reference of what's out there, but there are definitely better books on just about any topic presented in this text. I only got through chapter 4 and got very bored along the way.Buy at your own risk. This book is way overrated and boring."
1,disappointing,"I was not pleased with this book. I listened to the hype and bought it in hopes of learning something insighful about good programming style and some interesting theory. Instead, I got a very boring book. Half of it seems to be Scheme specific, which completely negates its purpose of being ""language independent"". The other half is tryly theoretical, but it's either completely irrelevant, or it is self evident, such as abstraction. Anyone who has done some programming knows that splitting programs into procedures, and data into abstract objects is a good thing. Do we really need to read a whole chapter or more to relearn this? Reading this text is futile. Its cause is good, but it falls far short of its overstated goals."
1,don't read unless you like to be bored,"This book is used as a filter in our computer science department. It subjects students to material so boring, and presented so poorly, that only those who can stand through it all ever stay on for more computer science classes. Complete waste of your time....it describes (in a confusing manner) concepts which can be better learned elsewhere. The authors apparently believe that quantity is better than quality, and try to cram a lot of material without explaining any of it in detail."
1,solid waste .... of time,"I'm not sure who the target audience is (besides the poorMIT undergrads who are force to sift through this [junk]), buthaving taught (as an assistant to a professor) a lower-levelcomputer science class (one not dealing with Scheme, thankfully)I have asked many freshmen abou their thoughts on this book andthe class taught out of it.*ALL*hated it. Some PhD students, whose specialty was programminglanguages, tolerated it, while other PhD students also hated it.So there you have it. If you are into programming languages likeScheme, this text is for you to salivate over Hal Abelson'sself fornication (how else would you call the senseless drivelhe wrote?). Otherwise, stay away. Beginning CS students will comeaway frustrated, as virtually every conventional algorithm isNOT implementable in scheme, and those who aren't beginnersand have no inherent interest in Scheme will simply find thebook a waste of time."
3,This book has very little to do with modern software enginee,"I would have to agree that this book has very little to do with modern software engineering. While some experience with meta-languages is certainly beneficial, spending an entire semester writing scheme progs is a solid waste of time. C++ and Java have been on a market for a Number of years (c was founded in 81), and all of the potential employers ""appreciate"" ur knowledge of them. Another point I want to bring is in regard to some previous reviews oversimplifying the transition from meta language to C++. Not only it is not easy, but it is also quite confusing. May be reading C++ in 24 hours gives you the idea that you are a big guy, but believe me, C++ is much more powerful than that. Take a look at The C++ Programming Language by Bjarne Stroustrup is you feel you are ready to face the challenge, but please don't stop your quest at the page X."
5,Get this book from Barnes and Noble it's only $52!,"this book is $52 at barnesandnoble.com where it is $65 here.:\Hey, gotta be loyal to the price, right?R"
5,what Feynman is to physics,"This book is to Computer Science what the Feynman Lecture notes are to physics: an introductory text that could reshape the mind of the average PdD. It's not about Lisp, it's not about Scheme, it's about computing at the most fundamental levels. If you're an experienced programmer, it will change your way of thinking forever. If you're a novice, it will set you down the right path. Read it and work through every problem. Repeat every few years."
5,At least give it a try!,"This is the bravest book on programming I have read. I say bravest because, rather than use Pascal or C and give you the topics ""you must know"", the authors broke free from tradition. They use Scheme, a language of astonishing flexibility and uniformity, and they show you the topics they believe are beautiful and will enlighten you.The result is a book that makes you think hard, and poses deep questions. If you are the type who likes thinking about the ""foundations"", this book can be a revelation, no less. You don't need previous experience or helper books, all you need is contained in this one; but you will need to work hard, and even take breaks, as the pace becomes very hard by the last two chapters. The book is beautifully written, though not adorned, and it provides you with a vocabulary and ways of thinking that will become indispensable, and that are rarely found in other books. Good luck!"
1,unenthusiastic presentation of computer science,"After reading this book, I went away having learned absolutely nothing. I knew about good program design techniques, such as abstraction, but I haven't been taught anything more. The problem with the text is that it tries too hard to cram all there is to know about computer science into one book. I understood what was going on, but ideas seemed disconnected. I felt as if I was at a car dealership, with someone blabbering at my ear and I'm not able to examine anything in detail. A better idea would be to get a nice, thick book on any specific topic after you learn the basics of programming from a C text. This book tries to present compilers, query systems and hardware design, but it'll leave you confused at best and won't teach you, because the presentation is not thorough."
1,This isn't a fun read,"Besides the heavy and dull material (which may not be that bad at all) this book has an unfriendly style, as if the authors are trying to elevate themselves above the crowd, instead of teach something. I won't recommend this text even to my enemies."
1,overrated,"The book promises to make a better programmer out of you, to teach you how to think about programs, but this promise is not kept. Those things which it presents that are relevant to overall philosophy of programming are already widely know as it is. The other things they present are completely useless. In short, you will not gain any valuable insight and won't see any revelations or any radical and vastly superior methods of thinking about programs. It's just mundane drivel here. To top it off, the book is very dry. I'm extremely interested in theoretical computer science and this book managed to bore even me. You'd need a lots and lots of patience to get through even a fraction of the material here. I wouldn't recommend this title to anyone."
1,WARNING: This book will cause you severe pain,"I'm all for learning about good programming style, and I'm sure plenty of things in this book could be applied to some good purpose (with a stretch of imagination) but there's just no excuse for a book to be written so poorly. It is boring, it is confusing, and you won't learn much by reading it. I only figured out the concepts being presented after I went and listened in lecture at my university. In other words, don't get this book if you hope to learn on your own. You won't."
1,bad book!,"Unless you are required to have this text for the course (and why else would you buy this terrible book?) don't get the text. If you have any doubts about computer science, this book will make you hate it. It tries to mold budding computer scientists by gathering the driest, most boring subjects into one monster collection. You'll probably fall asleep before finishing the first few pages."
5,Fantastic Book.,"This is a fantastic book. I agree with the reviewers that say this book as little to do with contemporary software design and practice, and that's a shame, because if this book HAD more influence on contemporary software design, programs would work much, much better.This is a book about writing software, controlling complexity, identifying abstractions. It is filled with intelligence and wisdom. It is also a lot of fun."
4,You Might Learn a Thing or Two,"My CS professor at UC Berkeley, introduced his course as the best CS course at Berkeley because it uses the ""greatest CS book ever written."" For all the pain and long hours it has put me through, I must admit this book taught me concepts I never knew. This book is not for the casual reader who wants to learn practical programming, but rather for someone who wants to really be hit hard by all the important topics in Computer Science today. Good luck!"
5,I don't want to sound harsh but,the bipolar distribution of ratings shows how well this book separates the masters from the code monkeys. Read it. Study it. Find out which side of the fence you're on.
5,Great Read.,"Just read it, great great book with lots of insight. If you are one of those poor programmers that just want to cut code and get home this is not for you. If you are like me and still love what you do, if you are thrilled at the idea of 'having' to learn a new language to get a job done, love to discover new tools that make you even faster, love Knuth and the dragon book (Aho, Sethi, Ullman), then this book is for you.It really is spiritual, almost every chapter gave me that 'yes!' moment.I would also recommend watching the online video class taught under the same name from MIT, they are free online and on youtube."
5,At least give it a try!,"This is the bravest book on programming I have read.

1,horrible,"I must say, it takes great talent to take relatively simple and curious ideas, and present them in a very boring and convoluted way. That's right, this book will make you feel pain at every paragraph. You won't learn anything either. If you are interested in theoretical side of computers, there are plenty of better books. Don't waste your time and money on this one."
1,not interesting,"When will the professors learn, pedagocially correct curriculums don't always teach useful things. This book/course combo is an example. Nothing in this book is applicable. Nothing. Except for control of complexity through encapsulation, but just about any computer science course teaches that. It's the whole essense of computer science and we don't need yet another boring course to teach us that.I actually learned C and Pascal first, and I'm thankful I didn't get my mind screwed up by Abelson and Co. From those 2 languages, I went on to learn others and even assembler. I got the essential concepts. Had I read SICP first, and didn't know any better, I might be writing bloated, confusing code this very moment. I sincerely hope this book doesn't get widespread. It won't, all students I talked with hate it."
3,Has nothing to do with modern software engineering,"I can see why this book gets mixed reviews. On the one hand, it is very well written and covers some interesting ideas, but on the other hand, it has absolutely nothing to do with modern software engineering practice. If you just want a good stimulating read, then by all means buy it, but if you want to learn something of practical value to the software engineer you must look elsewhere. It also strikes me as being rather old fashioned and doesn't issues such as distributed computing or object orientation adequately."
3,Where May I get the answers to the exercises?,HiI bought Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs and the Instructor's Manual hoping that the answers would be in at least one of them. No answers. I'm not enrolled in any school so don't have access via that route. Could someone please let me know where I can get them. Would greatly appreciate it.Kevin
1,Dry and Unhelpful,"Just because the author graduated from MIT doesn't mean it's great. Like most academic books, this book relishes on sophistication and pedantics for the sake of academics. While it is true that there are some important concepts here, the concepts themselves are a bit self-explanatory. For example, he talks about modularity and how important it is to break code down to parts. Everyone learns that in introductory CS. I even learned that by experience before I took a computer course.I would've excused the dry writing if he had presented some timeless and interesting concepts. But there aren't any.I read a very dry book on algorithms, ""Algorithms in C"", andI really found it very useful because it presented some interesting concepts and had some minimal source code examplesto follow.So I would not recommend this book at all. I didn't really get anything out of it."
5,Wonderful,Great product and well adapted for the need to update your bulbs with good performance one (much better than cheap ones found in stores). I recommend highly this quality product.
3,Item is misrepresented!,"The 100w/55w bulb is exactly as described, but the photograph depicts two bulbs in a package. I only received one in a factory packaged box."
1,hella lights,"ATTN: this is the wrong product! it comes as two, individually packaged STOCK Hella bulbs. THEY ARE NOT WHITE/BLUE."
5,Off Road Halogen Bulbs,Good headlight upgrade. The extra wattage on the high beam really lights up the road nicely when you are on the road alone.
3,Can't tell difference between 100wt and 60wt,"I have the Hella on passenger side and the OEM on the driver side. I really can't tell the luminosity difference in high beam. But, it's a good price. Time will tell on longevity."
3,Cool...,This movie only worked for me on my computer because I got the wrong Region but I found and ordered the correct one so I'm good...
1,drop dead fred,"When I received this movie is was just sliding all around inside the case. it was not secured inside, This is a Christmas gift;I sent you an email asking for another movie to be sent out but i never received your reply. So as of right now I would not order any more movies from your site."
4,Great Family Entertainment,We can watch this video over and over again with the kids. I laugh everytime I see it. I recommend this video for anyone with young children.
5,Drop Dead Fred IS AWESOME for the whole family!,"This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I've only had it a short time but have watched it 3 times already with my nieces and nephews. They love it. This movie is a classic and everyone should watch it once. Though it's a little slow to start, once Drop Dead Fred appears the laughter will continue thru out the movie, except near the end where you are sure to shed a few tears.. but again, it doesn't end there like you think and the ending is PERFECT!"
1,Drop Dead Fred,"I've seen the movie before and wanted to have it in my collection, but I didn't know that it was a Region 2 movie, and I didn't understand what that was! When I got ready to return it and order the correct DVD I was told I couldn't return it or get a refund, you could imagine my fustration. They said I have to either purchase a Region 2 DVD player or I'm stuck. When I called around to locate one, no one carries them, but they're on Amazon, well they only play international movies so there's no need for me to purchase one. So people, please read carefully what you're about to buy on Amazon from these different sellers, I love Amazon, they're great, but everything isn't alway what it seems! Everyone's not aware about Region 2 DvD players and that they only play international movies!!!"
1,Dead Drop Fred..No really DEAD DROP FRED!!!!,"This film is vile,vomit-inducing,unpleasant,unfunny,ugly,hate-filled & creepy. DDF does not know if it wants to be for adults,kids or the mentally handicapped. The flashbacks sevre no point. The acting is third-rate. It also does'nt know what message they're trying get across,who they're trying get it across to & the best way to deliver it. The Psychologiacl ramifications are just disbursing. It's trying to be like Alice In Wonderland but it's more like Wonderland in Alice. I give this film a -0 out of 10."
1,This movie is desgustingly aweful a disgrace to VHS,"Words can not express how extremely dumb this movie is This deserves number one on the top 10 worsst list it has completely terrible directing, acting, writing, plot, and story this movie belongs in the trash can stay away from this -a concerned viewer"
5,More than just a comedy movie,"This is a comedy film, definitely. However, there is far more to this movie than just Rik Mayall going crazy - which is great. There is a much deeper meaning and story to the movie.The abusive mother, the cheating and controlling husband and the girl that is held captive by all of it - it's all here.If you had an abusive relationship with a parent, this is a good movie with a message. It is possible not to be the abused child all your life. It is possible to break free of that trapped, abused child. It takes courage to tell that abusive parent that you are free of them. Drop Dead Fred (Mayall) helps Elizabeth (Phoebe Cates) find that courage.There is an un-credited cameo in this movie by Bridget Fonda. The girl that Charles (Tim Matheson) is having an affair with is named Annabella played by Bridget."
1,Doesn't work,"Bought this DVD for my niece, she received it but it doesnt work in any of her media players... Blank disk. Besides that she likes the cover and enjoys showing it to her friends... I told her the whole story to compensate for the fact that I got her excited to watch it, but then again when I was a kid people didn't sell people blank discs... Anywho, I emailed the seller and got no response."
5,Drop Dead Fred,"Bought this for my 9 year old daughter and she can't stop watching it! She loves this movie! Thinks Fred is great and loves the ""pants pie""....lol!"
1,completely disatisified,"Do not buy this item. It does not play in the U.S. I assumed it would. It only plays in REGION 2, outside the US.I did not know this until I tried to play it. The company refused to accept a refund or a return because I opened the dvd.How in the xxxx was i supposed to know it would not play unless i tried it. I crossed them off my to buy list."
2,region 1 or 2?,wish i was informed of what those mean. or that it only played on certain dvd players. other than that everything was quite satisfactory
1,This movie is heartless and it is terrible,The movie is gross obnoxious and far from funny!I feel sorry for the mother having to put up with that demon child who blames her terrible behavior on her imaginary friend. If Fred is supposed to be helping her how is him wreaking havoc helping her or anyone for that matter. If I was the mother found dog poo on my carpet I'd have that brat sent military school. As for Fred he needs to be sent to the blackest void in space!
3,A fairly good comedy...,"Rik Mayall, one of the funniest men I've seen on T.V. stars as the main character in this fantasy/comedy about a girl who has an imaginary friend,but as she grows up, her immature imaginary friend Fred feels dissowned by the girl (Cates). Corny in places but still watchable."
1,wrong dvd region listed seller error,I never ordered this region the seller was talking about & then he refused to work with me on it & it would cost more for me to send it back then to keep it now I have a DVD that is useless. He never offered even a replacement for the trouble! Just horrible. This is America...why would I order a DVD that don't work on an American made dvd player!!!!!!!!!!!
1,WASTED MY MONEY!,"I am not able to even load the DVD in any of our DVD players! It was not specified that this DVD can only be viewed in certain parts of the world, USA not being one of them! It was a complete waste of my money and I am stuck with it!!! I wanted to watch this movie with my kids because I loved it so much when I was little. Movie night with my girls was compltetely busted!I am noy happy at all!"
4,unable to play,"I did not realize that there were different regions, so therefore I could not play the DVD. So this was of no benefit to me."
2,movie,I only give 2stars bc when i ordered this movie I was unaware tht there was a region set to it. I can not view this movie on my DVD player I have to watch it on my computer. Which means I don't get the full effect of how great this movie is as I know it to be.
4,Good Movie :),"The previews started out really fuzzy, and with lines through it, but it did straiten out, when the movie started. Definitely NOT the sellers fault, but when I received the movie, the packaging was destroyed by the usps. All in all, Good Movie, and it made my wife VERY happy."
5,It made my Sissy smile.,"I was very pleased with the price, quality and timing that it was received. It is my sissy's favorite movie and she reports that it plays great. Very happy, we are ! Thanks."
4,"Great Movie, Not Enough Plot","DDF is a great movie. Hilarious scenes, and it is so real . The only thing is it doesn't have much plot. Its just Lizzy & Fred doing hilarious pranks."
1,no show,This DVD would not play on my BluRay player. I didn't try to return it because of the postage costs. Was really disappointed.
1,wtf,first off i loved this movie since i was a child .... but my main damn problem is ... why the hell is it so expensive ? and whoever buys it at anything over $15 is just damn nuts ... i was going to get it but not for the outrageous price gouging going on ... ill burn it off of someone who i know that has it .....
1,Drop Dead Fred,"I ordered this movie for my granddaughter not knowing that because this movie is coming from England, it will not play in the US. The seller didn't even tell me."
1,About as funny as dog poop on your shoe,"I must say I read with astonishment the comments about this video being ""empowering"" and ""uplifting"". Obviously there are some Amazon amateur reviewers who desperately need to get out more. Fails as a comedy, fails as a psychological examination of repression, succeeds only in conveying a bit of Rik Mayall's talent, here chained to an unlikeable premise and heavy-handed director. Phoebe Cates's blank doe-eyed stare will make you reach for the remote."
1,Unsatisfied,"Cancelled order due to lost in shipping and no way of tracking it. Was not able to send replacement, was out of stock."
1,This movie just SUCKS!,"This is one of, if not the worst movie I've almost seen. I got up and walked out of it and got my money back. Cates gives me serious wood but even that couldn't keep me watching it. DO NOT waste your money! I would, if I could, give it a negative star rating, one star is way too good for it."
1,Not going to do this again,"I choose this rating because I received the movie, and the case was all shattered into pieces. Plus the movie won't even play in my dvd player. Then played it on my laptop and it's scratched to hell. People should not sell this crap to others when they are expecting good stuff like they have always got through amozon, makes for bad reviews and the question if you should order again."
2,Was so excited for this movie....,"I watched this movie when I was a kid and havnt seen it since to own,,,, Found it online and ordered it and I cant watch it on any of my TVs since it shipped from England and all I get is an region error code and I have found no way around this :("
1,Not Able Watch,"cant not watch in US, need disclose that under title or at first in description who gonna click on dvd format. You assume can be view anywhere. So UPSET!!!!!"
1,I need to return this,"I need to return them, I couldnt watch them, they wouldnt play. I tired 3 different DVD players. I was really disappointed they were gift for Christmas. Can you email me back on how i can return them. Thank you."
1,Be careful before you buy this,"If you are looking for a new DVD, don't buy this. IT IS A COPY! I thought I was getting a new DVD and got a copy. It doesnt say anywhere that it's a copy. DISAPPOINTED!"
1,Drop dead Fred DVD,I ordered this DVD about a month ago and when I finally got it I tried to play it to watch and it did not work at all. So I can't even watch it.
4,Drop Dead Gorgeous.,"I think I was 6 years old when I first saw this film. From then onwards, I rented it nearly everytime we went to the video store. Ask my mother, I'm sure she can recite the film word-for-word.This film is probably what started my love affair with British comedy, and although, being an American film and having some soppy and serious moments, I think the film is purely based on the comic genius of Rik Mayall - his facial expressions, his constant stamina, and just the way he approaches each situation. In his live performances of Bottom, with Young Ones co-star Adrian Edmondson, all these attributes are evident.So, if you want a laugh and you're not afraid to let go to stupid childish humour, ( ""Snotface! Yuck, what happened to you? You're all older! You're even uglier! I'm sorry, I'm going to have to be sick all over you immediately. Lie down."") then bloody go for it. Trust me, in 500 years time, this film'll be in the Hall of Fame."
1,Infernal Leprechaun Friend,"""Drop Dead Fred"" doesn't know what audience to cater to. It's a very confused little movie. Is it a dark comedy about Phoebe Cates' overactive imagination? Is it aimed at kids? It's been noted that if this movie were set to horror movie music fromThe Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen),it would work. Fred, the Evil Leprechaun, manages to ruin everything in Phoebe's life, from destroying the houseboat of Carrie Fisher (Star Wars Trilogy) to ending a date in chaos. It's supposedly about Phoebe's empowerment, and towards the end she journeys into her own mind--yeah, if only David Lynch had directed this (Mulholland Drive)""Drop Dead Fred"" is an awful movie. Avoid it for the kids. Avoid it for the future."
2,READ REGION 2,READ REGION 2. ALL THESE REVIEWS ABOUT THE STORY ARE NOT THE POINT. READ THE REGION 2! WILL NOT PLAY ON MOST USA MACHINES! READ THE REGION 2!$$$ FOR WILL NOT PLAY ON MOST USA MACHINES!
1,Do not order from here!!!,"This DVD was bad, I could not view the movie at all! Do not order from this company~ I cannot watch the DVD...it doesnt play the movie! Horrible customer service!"
3,Okay for some,"The movie itself is okay, but certainly not for everyone. I'm posting this for the sake of everyone that ordered it and got the region 2 version (and it seems there were many). Here's some advice for future reference: confirm the region code with the seller if it matters to you. Don't expect them to list it correctly; when it comes to DVD region codes they are often listed incorrectly. Also, it is easy to obtain a multi-region or region-free DVD player, or just watch it on your computer (mine's hooked up to a 42-inch flatscreen). Playing foreign DVDs is easy-peasy, you just have to know how to do it and make the effort. It's surprising they even bother producing different regions anymore; it matters not to most people who wish to view them."
4,Drop Dead Fred,The movie was in very good condition and it played very good. I recieved the movie the day that amazon said i would. I actually bought this product for my son for a Christmas Present and I know he is going to love it. Thank You.
5,the best movie ever,"As a child, this movie was my favorite, and still is. I always wanted an imaginary friend, and what better to have than a British accented nose-picking guy! This movie is great, the language is bad at the beginning, so parent guidance is requested but other than that, it's a heart warming tale. Elizabeth, the main character, still needs an imaginary friend though because she never got to grow up right thanks to her vicious mother, but when Fred comes back, all is well. A great story, maybe a bit too magical for some kids, but still fun to watch."
1,Dont buy in the US!!!!!,"I ordered this DVD and when it got to me, It was a DVD that was not able to play in DVD players in the USA. I ordered it from New York!!!! It was bought in the USA but cant be used in the USA. These people will rip you off with a smile and refused to refund me. Dont waiste your money. Fair warning."
1,Region 2,"Was not aware there was such a thing as Regions? It wasn't until we got the movie and tried to play it on a DVD then the xbox that we realized and had to look up on Google this issue even existed!!!!Going back to the original order and reviewing, it does mention that it might not be able to be played...but was missed as it is down below and unfortunately was not reviewed that far down the page. This disclaimer should be made more visible by placing it up top and near the $ amount of the movie.All we knew is we liked the movie and found a good price for it, didn't know about region codes or anything to take time and review the site!!!BE CAREFUL"
1,Drop dead Fred,"I can't watch this movie it says ""can't play in this region"" I didn't know DVD players were different in England that is where it was shipped from,also it took three weeks to arrive and I couldn't return it so now I just own a useless coaster."
1,Waste of Money,"Don't waste your money on this product. There are sharp prongs on either end of the band to push into the hat. Poor quality cotton fabric, the hems are merely ironed over and come loose very easily."
5,Will it ever appear on CD?,"Like Carlos points out, this is a gem that really deserves to reach a wider audience. This masterpiece should be introduced to the CD generation as well as to those of us old enough to remember the release. But the record is impossible to track down. The way Chris Spedding (could only have been equalled by Jeff Beck) imitates the Duck using the guitar only is worth the price alone. Spedding isn't the only great musican appearing on this RSO recording. Gary Moore, Alvin Lee and John Goodsall on guitars, Brian Eno, Phil Collins, the sophisticated bass players Percy Jones, Dave Marquee and Andy Pyle, John Hiseman, Bill Bruford and Cozy Powell helping out Collins on drums. Manfred Mann, Gary Brooker... And it works! No show-offs, and suberbly directed by the eccentric Viv Stanshall as narrator. There is a big black hole in my record collection, and it will remain there until I get hold of this record."
4,Chicago Cutlery Walnut Kitchen Knife,My prior CC Kitchen Knives slowly disappear.I'm pleased to find them available from Amazon online.Great Kitchen knives at a superior price. Willl resharpen well with due care.I use a countertop electric sharpner.
5,Chicago Cutlery is the best,"I was very happy to find the Chicago CutleryChicago Cutlery Walnut Tradition 3-Inch Paring/Boning KnifeWalnut Tradition paring knife on Amazon. I've owned a set o Chicago Cutlery for almost 30 years and recently lost my small paring knife. I've enjoyed these knives over the years and tried to take good care of them, resharpening the blades and oiling the wooden handles. I was a little heartbroken when I couldn't find the paring knife, it's the one of these set I use most. Couldn't find a replacement at local stores but thank goodness for Amazon."
2,Just OK,"I got this and another Chicago Cutlery knife for my wife. She didn't like the handle of this one at all. She has small hands, so that may be a factor. I also bought the: J.A. Henckels International 3-Piece Paring Knife Set, which she raved about. Also, it didn't seem to her that this knife was very sharp right out of the package, while the J.A.Henckels knives were very sharp. Considering that this knife is as expensive as the J.A.Henckels 3 knife set, I don't consider it a great value either."
3,Needs to be sharpened often,"My wife really likes her twenty year old Chicago Cutlery Walnut set of knives, so when her paring knife finally made its last cut I found this knife as the closest looking alternative to what she had. The saying ""they don't make them like they used to"" is very appropriate. She likes the feel, she likes that it looks so close to her original. I hate it because of how often it needs sharpened."
2,Tinny,"I bought this to complement a comparable 25 year old Chicago Cutlery paring knife we have used daily for this time. There is no comparison. The new one has a wispy blade that bent immediately when I tried to pry apart some frozen goods. The old one did this hundreds of times without any problems. Clearly a ""program for profit"" at CC led to cheaper steel. Doesn't say so on the product, but probably Chinese manufacture. In a cutting device, this is not the way to go. Very disappointed."
5,Does the job!,Does what it says it does! I have a 2006 Pontiac Torrent and this did the trick for adapting to my Sirius FM direct adapter
3,"Work, but I'm unsure of connection at the radio","This is a required cable adapter set for installing the AudioVox FMDA25 audio relay in a GMC 2002 Envoy. Everything went together well with the exception of the connection to the radio itself (the most critical part). The barbs on the connector are very soft, and not providing much tension. The connector plugs in fine, but I'm concerned that it will back out of the radio socket with vibration from driving. These were not inexpensive for what they are, and I expected better. At least if it fails (lost reception)I will know what is wrong."
2,A spoof that drags.,"I like Aykroyd and Hanks as actors and Aykroyd has typed some witty scripts like Ghostbusters, but Dragnet falls flatter than a lead balooon. The chemistry between these two actors never really ignites in this spoof of the original TV series - a classic in itself. What keeps it alive and stops one from yanking the disc before its over is the plot - there is a genuine urge to know how the various pieces fall together. A crime story needs a resolution and this script provides a crime story - pretty wacky one at that! The car chases, shoot outs, and stuff are all respectably done so there was nothing stinted in extras in this film. What more can I say!"
3,More of a parody than a remake,"With that being said, it is done extremely well. There are some really unforgettable scenes in this movie which make it well worth the effort to find it and watch it."
4,"Funny, funny, funny","Anyone who doesn't like this movie is suffering from the mind-altering effects of the pseudohallogenic compound Cyanigin (inside joke: get it?). With Tom Hanks, Dan Aykroyd, Christopher Plummer, (don't forget Dabney Coleman!), this movie offers a fun-filled romp through a Playboyesque mansion, a ""Milk. Fresh, wholesome milk."" factory, and a part of Los Angeles where it's best not to stand on the street corner at 10pm on a school night whistling.Seriously, though, this is a fun movie. While Aykroyd isn't up to par given his previous role as Dr. Raymond Stanz (late of Columbia University) in Ghostbusters (""Does this pole still work?""), he's much better than in some of his others: The Couch Trip, Sneakers, etc.Christopher Plummer is genius, as always.For all you law students, this movie offers a good lesson on the First Amendment, with the whole pornography/book burning thing."
4,"Just an opinion, if nobody minds","With all due respect to the legend Jack Webb and the television series that spawned this movie, the not-always-easy-to-achieve comic chemistry in this movie makes it a delightful diversion, and a must for the home viewing collection. SNL veteran Dan Akroyd does the deadpan Friday with consummate skill, and the rookie Tom Hanks is a fox with great timing and an unbelievable career in his future."
2,Dragnet 1987,"This is a parody? I call it a mockery of the original tv series. Jack Webb would be spinning in his grave if he saw how his series, his trademark mocked as a comedy! The movie is funny at times, and it only features Harry Morgan reprising his role as Gannon, but the movie is nothing but a mockery to the classic crime series that Jack Webb made."
4,Daft but funny!,"Funny eighties take-off of a rather boring Tv series. Dan Aykroyd plays Joe Friday (perfectly I might add), the straight faced cop and Tom Hanks plays Pep Streebek, the rebel cop. Kinda stupid comedy but it works well and makes a very funny film. My favourite scene being the one where Emil Muzz drives over Friday's feet, the face he makes is a classic comedy moment!"
2,Dull with flashes of humor,"There's a lot of potential in this film, as in many of Aykroyd's efforts, for deft satire; and as in so many of his films, only the most obvious gags are deployed along the way. Some jokes work, but when they don't, or in the long stretches in between, there's simply nothing to draw and hold the interest. In Webb's style, Aykroyd achieves the remarkable feat of overacting restraint. Hanks is at least personable, but not much more. Plummer is wonderfully nasty, and the film has a large budget to display. There's a lot of bloat here, however, and you can't help thinking that the main result of this film was a series of truly wild parties for all concerned in its production."
2,Ain't nothing like the real thing baby...,"Good performance by Aykroyd still doesn't save a weak plot that tends to drift, the big screen version just doesn't measure up to the TV series."
4,Crackup of a movie,"It's been several years since I've seen this movie, but I remember that it was non-stop laughs when I saw it. I recommend that If you want to have a riotous evening,(or any other time you see it)purchase this movie. Dan Akyroyd is golden as Joe Friday and Tom Hanks is his usual brilliant self."
4,Another 80's Classic!!!,"This was a really good buddy-cop comedy of the 80's! Although I never saw the original series, so I can't compare it to the show. Dan Akroyd does an awesome job as Joe Friday and Tom Hanks does an awesome job as Pep Streebek! Joe is by-the-books, and Pep is more laid back. They investigate a cult known as P.A.G.A.N. and try to get just the facts and stop the leader and save the girl! If you love comedy and cop action, you'll love DRAGNET!!!"
3,Cute but a bit Rauchy,This movie was as funny as I remebered but a bit more crude than I remembered. Acting by the two leads and Harry Morgan are classic. I needed a laugh and it didn't let me down.
1,toolbox,Toolbox was of very poor quality. Beware of vendors who don't show actual image when they present their goods
5,Super Product,"I love these headphones. They cannot be beat for the price & quality.If you pay more for better phones you are wasteing your money as faras I am concerned. The sound quality is super, very good Bass reproduction.They perform as represented in their description. They are easy to hook upas they are supplied with several different adapters. I initionally hadquite a time figureing out how to access the Right Ear headphone until Istarted to pull on the padded earpiece, this released the pad from the hardplastic caseing. Once you figure that out the rest of the installation isa breeze.I also charged the batteries as they suggested for the amount of timeas stated in the manual. I would recommend these Headphones to anyone. Readthe manual & do what it says. Setting the phones on the base unit for chargingmight be tricky for some. Just pay attention on how they are oriented when youplace them & no problems should be experienced as some of the reviews mention.Go for it ."
4,Extra Ears!,I purchased this product after reading some reviews on this and similiar products. One review stated that there were numerous problems with the product. I am quite happy Ipurchased the product. The proof of a good product is this: Would you buy it again? Theanswer is Yes! I have purchased several products from Amazon and will continue to use them in the future for other purchases.
