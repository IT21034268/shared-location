5,Cantinflas four pack,"DVD Just too good, the only think the price is too much very high price, is there other places to buy cheaper at $5.69 each dvd, same quality."
3,"Nice ideas, but too expensive","This book is to home improvement, what a Rolls Royce is to the automobile world. Everything is done in grand style, for instance, the fences in her gardens are all hand made. She uses genuine copperleaf to spruce up a flight of stairs that no one will ever see, due to location. This book is big, literally, bold, beautiful and luscious in every way, except practicality"
3,Nice idea,"As a recent purchaser of an old house, I really enjoyed the first few sections of this book and thought it might really be helpful for our remodel. However, it quickly turned into a big spend-fest, as other reviews have mentioned. Get this only for the nice pictures and commentary, certainly don't expect advice on how to do anything yourself."
3,A diary of a major renovation,"This book chronicles the renovation/restoration that Martha Stewart completed on a historic New England farmhouse. It is very specific about many of the tasks that she completed, and gives some general how-to information (how to hire a contractor, create a landscape design, etc). I was disappointed because I was looking for ideas to restore and renovate my ""new old house"" and didn't really find much inspiration here. Much of the decorating revolved around painting murals and designs on the floor, which is something that I don't plan on doing. If you are planning a major renovation project to a large, historic home, this book might be a good starting place but I wouldn't rely on it for all of my information. Although it didn't really help me with my specific plans, it was an interesting, sometimes sketchy, read."
3,mixed bag,On one hand I liked seeing step by step how an old run down house was saved and restored (be kind to your handy man and all contractors-- they're heroes) but I really didn't like how Martha kept reminding the readers in what seemed to be every chapter how tacky the previous owner was. That didn't seem particularly kind and it was not necessary to the success of the book.
5,Martha's restoration project,"I was actually quite impressed with the level of detail that was put into this book. Even though she herself did not do the actual heavy bits of restoration, she provides in detail what was actually done on her New York farmhouse and illustrates it with some pretty nice photos. I'm pleased and the shipment was fast. Thanks!"
1,No luck with this printer,"I had nothing but problems with this printer. Returned the printer twice due to the same proplem, which was, randomly placed horzontal lines thoughout every document I printed. Tech support was no help. They suggested changing printer cable, which I did, but I got the same results. The 1200 x 1200 DPI resolution is what drawn me to the product, only if I could have got it to work. I ended up purching the Canon BJC- 6000 and I must say I am very happy."
1,Seriously,This thing went through $38 cartridges like it was going out of style. The cartridges always clogged. It was a total headache. Do the smart thing and invest in a quality printer. Believe me I thought I could sneak by with this one. But you have to buy the usb cord ($12) and your first cartdrige ($38) so the total price is much more than advertised. Dont due it.
3,Junk in 27 months,"Worked fine for 26 1/2 months, good quality. purchased new cartridges (Lexmark) shortly thereafter, started skipping. One week of Lemark email support and nothing. Total of 7 emails for support, none of their fixes cured the problem. Support does not read the emails, on my 6th email, support was going to ship an exchange as if I was in warranty. (I was not) My purchase date was in every email (Factory warranty one year) was just trying to cover my investment in new cartridges. No more Lexmark for me. Did not expect something for nothing. fed up with terrible support. Could purchase another Z31 to make cartridges good. No Way !"
5,if you like hank books you will like this one,this is a really good hank book and i have read them all. it includes lots of the usual characters plus introducing the vampire cat.
3,Good for a chuckle!,"Hank is humorous and entertaining. Sometimes, hilarious. You just might have to stop reading for a minute to have yourself a good laugh. This book is good reading for boys, ages 8 and up. Girls will like it, too."
4,Great for educating children about Executive Order 9066.,"Most of the artwork are done in black ink on white paper. It makes for a stark and bleak testament to the difficulties faced and endured by the internees. The book is a great teaching tool for children and adults, not only to learn about the internment, but to study the artwork."
3,Not one of Robbins' best,"""The Betsy"" is a novel about the Detroit car industry. Former race car driver Angelo Perino is hired by Loren Hardeman I (aka ""Number One""), founder of Bethlehem Motors, to help develop a new car, ""The Betsy"". This forms the main plot of the novel, and then there are a number of subplots about Perino and three generations of the Hardeman family (there are three characters named Loren Hardeman, all of them often referred to as simply ""Loren"", making it difficult sometimes to know which one the author is referring to at the moment).""The Betsy"" doesn't live up to Robbins's best work. It lacks focus and direction. There are plenty of subplots and minor characters but none are interesting enough to really keep the reader's attention and interest. There's more focus on business dealings and board meetings than on human emotion and relations. There's plenty of sex but, again, little emotion. And the ending is less than satisfying. A very weak 3 star rating."
3,Other Books,"Harold Robbins' The Betsy is a book that should appeal to the petrol head types a little, as well as the usual fans of his formula and style. He again follows a young man growing up, and this man wants to race cars and make money. If he has fame, power, money, women and sex, then that is all pretty cool too."
4,Vintage Zevon,"This is a collection of old tapes and interviews. It is not what I would suggest for someone checking him out for the first time. For the Warren ""virgin""(not many around him by the sound of it) I would suggest ""Warren Zevon"" and ""Exciteable Boy"".But for a long term diehard customer like me, then what you do is play Preludes, and read ""Sleep When I'm Dead"". Then it all makes sense.... or not.Much of it is demo quality, but good listening. And gives an insight into the man, and how he built his songs.Ownership is compulsory"
4,Zevon Unearthed,If stuff doesn't get released by the artist there is usually a reason. This is not clean-and-pretty Zevon. BUT its FUN Zevon. Disc one has my new favorite version of Werewolves of London. There's a lot of unusual stuff and its great for any Zevon fan. Disc two is an interview that shows off Zevon's cantankerous side. The interviewer asks questions like a high school reporter scoring his big break and doesn't really listen to the answers but still the interview is made all the more poignant by the fact that Zevon has little knowlege that he has so little time left. THe set is a must for Zevon fans but probably won't make any new ones.
5,zevon,"best for a big fan, demos of later hits a treat, as are zevon comments and unique versions of several songs"
3,"Great interview, average music","I was not impressed by disc one containing outtakes and non-published originals. However, the disc 2 interview was illuminating."
2,Disappointment,"I felt this book was poorly written. The first part was good; It drew me into the story. However when I got to the last 3-4 chapters, there was so much going on that was never developed properly. It seemed like the author got tired of writing and just ""dumped"" a bunch of ideas all at the end."
1,Don't bother,"This book is full of cliches, making it pretty much unreadable. I don't think I've ever read anything so poorly written.Don't waste your money!"
1,Please Don't Waste the time,"I thought this would be a fun read, being an historical buff and one to love whimsy.... I was much dissapointed with with what others have mentioned as well. The need to use the Beatles????!!! In an 1800's book? Why? For what purpose?Off with thier heads, she claims was a common phrase for Queen Elizabeth 1st...whose Mother died from that very thing, so while people were executed by QEI?? It was the Red Queen from Alice in Wonderland. How hard would simple research?I had thought this would be a cute read, something for my bath, instead? I was so irritated by the whole effort of dealing with the authors thought of being cute? It messed up my night.Truly? Just go and find Julie Garwood's Bride, or Jude Devereaux if you want a good book, this one would best be used as filler for your bird's poop."
1,"No, bookaholic, you're not alone.","I'm only giving this book one star because amazon.com doesn't have an option to give no stars. I found this book unreadable (I didn't finish it). The humor was clumsy and heavy-handed (and not humorous), the heroine was ditzy and the hero an oaf, and it was clear that the author knows nothing about science, despite the fact that the heroine is supposed to be a brilliant scientist. Don't waste your money."
5,Minda's Magical!!!,"I NEVER write reviews, however for this author I have written one on each of her books. Her books are transcending, they take you to a place where...well, keep that thought and read her books! I can assure you, you will not be disappointed."
1,Sucks beyond the telling...,"I can't believe that I paid money for this exercise in banality.I enjoy a fun romantic supernatural romp as much as the next reader, perhaps moreso. This was... painful. It was terribly unfunny, though I'm sure the author has a circle of friends who have mistakenly convinced her otherwise. The puns were heavy handed, the heroine an idiot.. and I don't think the author passed high school science. If she had perhaps she'd have parlayed some of this information to her heroine-- who is allegedly a scientist.I'm sending my book to Dorchester Publishing and asking for my money back."
4,Light and easy,I just read some of the other reviews and had to write one myself. This is not a great work of literature nor does it claim to be. It is a fun paranormal romance! I mean what did you think you'd get with a title like this!? I loved it. It was light and easy! Her play on words and actual literary characters was fun! I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good laugh and easy read every once in a while!
5,Very Glad He is Back,"This song is the best one off Arnold's latest album. I am truely glad he has gone back to, what he describes as, ""club sound."" Dreamy vocals and HIGH energy trance are what I want, and ATB delivers with this hit. The lyrics even opened my mind's imagination with the character's journey unfolding along with the beat. My preferred favorite track off this single is the clubb mix, and you won't be disappointed."
3,Not quite what I thought it was about,"I had expected smething different; however, I will be able to use some of the ideas in the future as I got several new ways to use the rag type of quilting."
5,"So many projects, so little time!",I LOVE rag quilts!!! There is a project for every month and I intend to make them all. The instructions are easy to follow and I believe everyone from a beginner to an experienced quilter would enjoy them.
4,Good Selection of Bands,This is a great two disc set! There is a great selection of artists both well known and some up and coming artists. What I enjoy most about this disc is that there are several different genres of metal music on this. This disc has the possibility of introducing some realy great established bands to a new fan base.
4,This is THE book,"Mr. Wirkmaa patterns his book directly on the Rules of Baseball, therefore making it simple to go from the Rules to his interpretation of how the scoring would be handled for that particular situation. This type of editing lays out what is still a complicated subject in at least a methodical fashion.My only disappointment on receiving the book was that he includes no diagrams on the scorekeeping itself. I wanted to see the actual scribblings when someone ""runs the book."" Not in there. I purchased another excellent book (not available through Amazon) entitled ""The Scorekeeper's Friend"" by Bill Glasco that has the level of diagramming (and explanations) that I was initially seeking.All in all, any person serious about their scorekeeping should own Mr. Wirkmaa's book. I hope he follows it up with another."
4,love it,This is my first griddle. It was an anniversary gift from my sister-in-law and her husband. I have never made such pretty eggs! My husband hates kitchen appliances (until he wants breakfast) so the fact that it folds up is a big plus. I have had it for about 6 months and use it often and have had no problems.
2,"oops, bad move.","I've now used the griddle twice. My left knob is loose and the temperatures between the two sides are inconsistent. Also, the gap created in the fold makes it difficult to pour pancakes, you can't pour on top and if you pour close, it may drip down into the cracks. I regret the purchase and wish I would have bought a good, big standard griddle and just kept it above my cabinets. Instead, I bought this griddle that is still bulky on my shelf, doesn't work that great, and isn't good quality. Maybe for tailgating or small apartments you can outweigh the performance issues with the storage benefits. -jl"
1,How-to book for pedophiles,"When I finished this book, I thew it into the garbage can! Under the guise of writing about the author's own abuse as a child and the ""desire"" of a pedophile to ""warn"" parents what to look for, much of this book relates in detail how to seduce a childÑa primer for pedophilia. My son was brutally raped when he was seven by the teenage son of our best friends, and I purchased this book in an attempt to understand about such monsters; I did not expect to discover a step-by-step instruction manual in how men can develop control over a child. ""In the Interest of Our Children"" Ñnot!!"
4,Cracker Cavalier Review,"This book is good for people looking for an ancestor, it includes a roster of the regiment with their service records."
4,"nice, but could be better...","This is a good product if you want to get a case for your mini. I have had this case for about a month, and it has kept my mini in perfect condition. The reason I gave this product four stars instead of five, is because it could be made out of better quality materials, but if you are considering getting this product I do suggest it. It isnt expensive, and it is one of the better cases out there. Also, dont expect it to fit in the dock, I did and it doesnt fit so if the only reason you are wanting to buy this is so your dock wont scratch your mini, then dont get this product. Hope this helped!"
2,"It's up, it's down, it's up, it's down...","Too bad there isn't a little blue pill for this head piece! Great sound quality - the best I've had in a bluetooth - but the design is awful! It just doesn't stay in position! First it's up in it's correct position, then it's flopping down. VERY disappointed. It went back to after the first couple of days. Also, the charger design is pretty iffy. Oh well. Save your money, don't buy this one."
3,Good in some places,"This product is great when you are in a controled sound enviroment but I bought it to use while out on construction sites and it is useless because everyone I am talking to complains about all the backround noise. While driving in my truck no problems, I love the battery operated charger it is fantastic I wish I could get one for my Cell Phone."
4,Great Product,"On the pro side, I find this easy to use and the convenient tube holder is one of the reasons. I also appreciate the battery charger that comes with it to use in between charges. It would be nice if it had a little more volume."
2,Disappointed,"As Discovery 640, it's extreamly comfortable to wear and you will even forgot u are wearing it. it's light weight, stressless to your ears. but it's terrible that Discovery 645's talk time is only 3 hours (on spec.), while its previous version Discovery 640 got 5 (on spec, too) due to its DSP noise cancelling function, it drain battery badly, and the MOST DISAPPOINTED thing is there is NO MULTIPOINT !!! it's pointless to buy this newer version will less talk time and the most important multipoint function (which mean while u have your headset connected to your computer, u can't answer a phone call with the headset). The bottom line is : I'd not recommand you to buy this product."
5,Lightweight,"I have been using my 645 DSP Headset and love the small size, fit in the ear and it's so lightweight I forget that I'm wearing it. The noise level is minimal and I can hear much better than with previous headsets I've owned.Rosemary/Port Charlotte, FL"
1,Very disappointed,I ordered this items from Amazon a couple weeks ago. I got it in to find that it feels very cheaply made. It connected easily to the phone. But the connection is static filled. If there is any noise in the background the person I am talking to can not hear me. The range is basically none existent. If I place the phone in my pocket on the opposite side that I am wearing the Bluetooth on the connection breaks up instead of just being full of static. If I place it on my kitchen table and walk to the stove in my small kitchen the Bluetooth becomes so garbled the person on the line can not understand what I am saying. The battery life is very nice but does not redeem the poor call quality on it. I have tried many different Bluetooth headsets and this is by far the worst.
5,Awsome as always...,"I really like this headset. It's easy to use. The quality of call is great. The earbud is soft and in 3 sizes. The wire that goes around the ear is thin and comfortable. For anyone who's ears are very close to the hear, this headset is awsome!!!"
3,Try to hang on to it,"This bluetooth has a long charge life, and the reception is excellent. The problem I have with this product is that it is hard to keep in your ear. The little plastic hook that comes with it pops off and the ear peace falls out if one of the three ear plugs don't fit just right. It also has a charger that is difficult to operate. If it is not placed properly it will not charge.This is more work than it is worth."
3,Nice earpiece,"Well the buttons are very sensitive and its hard to get the timing right to do certain things. It is crystal clear, small, lightweight, comfortable, and looks cool."
1,poor charging design. so pretty but i have gotten tired of just looking at it,"Quite impressed with other plantronics bluetooth devices. Own a 510 and it works seamlessly with my macbook, blackberry and the bluetooth base i bought it with. The 645, is a nice looking device, but either i have a defective unit, or the design is flawed. the headset slides into a sleeve, that has the the connections in the base to charge the headset, but doesn't seem to hold the headset in the sleeve well enough to keep the charge going. My unit won't charge unless i physically hold it pressed into the base unit. It doesn't appear to be missing anything, and it charges when i hold the two pieces together, so i call this a bad mechanical design and would recommend not buying this product, but the 510 or anything else instead."
1,Charger design spoils a good headset,"I'm a headset gadget nut, so I bought into the Discovery 640-series as soon as it came out. Plantronincs apparently cannot get it through their heads that the Discovery 640 series charger design is irreparably flawed. I spoke to a corporate rep just about an hour ago on the status of this, but all she would say is that their company acknowledges some ""difficulties with early releases"" of this product. Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design. As MANY frustrated users have noted, the headset does not stay well connected inside the slipcase-style charger/case. Like others, I've tried tape, rubber bands, and everything I can think of, but to no avail. I plug it in, see the red charging light, but when I come back 10 or more minutes later the light is out (if the charge were complete it would turn blue) and I have to jiggle it to get it to keep charging."
2,Not worth it,"First of all, the listing here is inaccurate. The 645 does not have multipoint. The only plantronics headset to feature multipoint is the 510.Additionally, the holster is terrible. Assuming the holster will work to hold the headset will pretty much guarantee you will lose it.Sound quality is fine, however there is a significant delay between when the phone starts dialing and when the headset picks up. Same goes for answering calls.It's also extremely easy to accidentally trigger the auto-redial button.The only positive feature of the 645 is that it's comfortable, however certainly not enough so to merit the pricetag.All told, I would steer clear of this. Not worth the cost. If you're looking for a high end headset, I would suggest the Jabra JX10. I have one of those as well and am much happier with it."
1,Going back after less than 24 hrs,I have to say that this is one of the most poorly designed products that I have seen in a while. First of all the ear piece does not fit securely in the charger; consequently it does not make good contact with the charging posts and will not charge unless you hold the ear piece down. The second problem that I had with this device is that the charger and supplied adapter that it came with did not fit together tightly; it would not charge using the supplied charger assembly. I do not know how the product actually performed because I never got to use it. In my opinion Plantronics needs to hire a new product designer.
5,No charging problems,I think the people who complain about being unable to charge the device did not read the manual. Do they realize that it is not supposed to stay red but to flash intermittently while charging? I had no problem whatsoever charging this headset.The best part of this headset for me is that it comes with the small ear piece. My ears and ear canals are very small and everything falls out. I wear glasses so I don't want to wear a loop over my ear.It sounds great to me and those I am calling.I reccommend this headset.
5,Great,"Excellent product, very good sound quality, long lasting battery, variety of charging connectors.No multi-link."
3,Nice headset,"Overall, I am fairly happy with this unit, mostly because if you need it loud, this one really has the ability to work for you in a noisy environment.I found that this thing simply wouldn't stay in my ear unless I used the ear clip (included). I also hate the charging system. Too many parts to fall apart and lose. If I had it to do over again, I may try something different. I just thought I would get something better for the money."
4,"Great erudite insight into the common places of ""unique"" love","Ditto. If you're a nerd, a scholar, or a poet - or maybe just crazy in (preferable non-correspondend) love thinking that your love is so unique - buy this book and see the linguistic mechanics of it all. It's fun!"
5,Pretty slick,"As far as quickie championship stories go (and I've helped produce a few of them), this may be the best ever. Superbly packaged and illustrated, well written, this title is one I've enjoyed immensely.Roland Lazenbyauthor of Mindgames, Phil Jackson's Long Strange Journey"
1,wassup,Tried to order but could not. Kinda wonder why you show something on your web page and it is not available. Wastes my time and you get this ornery note at no charge.
1,Vague,"The package arrived quickly and in perfect order. The bible had in my view, very vague notes for bible verses. The essay regarding the history of religion, as far as I am concerned, casted doubt on the supremecy of God."
3,Jewish Study Bible,The translation is OK. The main reason I got it is for quick reading and reference which it is very good for. While the commentary is very liberal it does work for a quick reference and is good for the person who does not like deep study but just wants quick reference.
1,Presents a liberal perspective on the Bible,"This study Bible gives the ""standard"" liberal perspective on the books of the Bible. It casts doubt upon the authorship of the books and their accuracy. The notes read like they were written by skeptics. If you want a liberal slant on the Bible you may enjoy this Study Bible. If you are a conservative or traditionalist you should probably look elsewhere."
3,"Good resource, but depends on what you're looking for...","I was looking for a more traditional source to study-- the lack of the Hebrew text makes it difficult for me-- I feel like there is a large gap in this book.Some of the notes on cultural context of the times is helpful, but get to be somewhat intrusive and not necessarily what I have questions about. The scholarship does not seem to rely on the classic texts, or if it does, is not explained in enough detail for my level of study.I'd recommend Etz Hayim (the new JPS chumash) instead.It just depends on your approach how you will find this book. I was disappointed, but there is no lack of other sources for studying."
5,Choosing the right translation...,"Two of the three 'favorite' editions have a ""Look Inside"" feature that you can use to compare translations of Genesis. The listing for this edition does not have the ""Look Inside"" feature. No problem: To see Genesis for this version, google ""Jewish Study Bible Oxford University Press""(OUP). The OUP web page for this book offers a link to a PDF of Genesis. After looking at all three translations, I decided to purchase this one."
4,Good breadth,This study Bible covers a wide range of Jewish views. The historical sections are well done.
2,Beware,"Translation is okay. Study notes are saddening. Parts of the body of the Torah are described sometimes as ""Mythical"" and ""A Fairy-tale"". Study notes for Joshua 11 tell you that they are ""legendary, fictional tales"". Notes are very different than commentary. It makes me ask, ""Why would you follow a god that you believe is just a bunch of made up stories?""Some of the Hebrew notes are informative and interesting, and I enjoy that very much. There are however, Hebrew chapter or paragraph headings that (some) are never translated or explained, so that leaves me wondering why.Decide for yourself, but be forewarned what you're getting into."
3,Pagination Problem-Look at pages 1600 thru 1800,"There was a pagination problem with my copy. For example, the page after page 1607 Ecclesiastes 1.8-2.3, is page 1656 Daniel 7.8-7.20; page 1609 Ecclesiastes 2.2-3.10; page 16.58 Daniel 8.5-8.22; and so on. You may want to check your copy for this problem. It's pity since I liked the edition until I found this problem."
5,Great Resource!!!!!!,I purchased this book for my Old Testament Survey class. If I had known about it i would have already had one. The insight that I have gained just from the first few pages is indescribable.
5,durability,"I have had and used this camcorder for over 10 years now, it is very durable, reliable, and easy to use.An excellant piece, use it with a vcr and the adapter that come with it, and the tapes are easy to load and unload.Batteries are easy to charge, and are still sold as far as I know."
2,Long strange trip.,"This album should have been a slam dunk, but it's largely a frustrating bad trip into the Grateful Dead music arena. ""Friend of the Devil"" has the descending bass line of the tune running through it, but thats about all that's recognizable or enjoyable about the arrangement. As with many of the tunes here, the melody is too loud and shrill(trying to emulate Jerry Garcia's vocals?); chords and melody seem to each be in a different key sometimes and humming along will only lead to: huh?. where did that come from?There are snippets of Jerry Garcia leads and some nice capturing of groove (Sugar Magnolia) but it never hangs together-it sounds fragmented. Cullen had a great chance on ""Ripple"", but even that starts off abbrieviating the opening, the signature of the tune.Maybe Deadheads will buy this and enjoy, but I didn't-this can't decide if it's New Age, folk or rock and none of the arrangements are fully satisfying. This is a disappointment."
3,Grateful Guitar - David Cullen,"This is nicely tabbed, however it doesn't have ANY words or chord charts.Having the lyrics placed with the music is really very helpful to me."
3,It was okay... but not great,"Karen has joined a ice stating class. She is doing really great, and so is Ian, a boy in her class (at school). Her teacher asks them (her and Ian) to preform in an Ice Stating Show. Of course they say yes, but Karen is starting to hate this class. She doesn't like comeing and not being able to see her friends. She wants to quit! Does she? well read it to find out!"
5,Inspirational!,"This book is a great reminder of how fun our everyday relationships should be! It makes me sit back and think about how I relate to those near and dear to me. ""101 Rules for Relationships"" is a book you will want to share with your closest, most special friends. It's inspirational!"
5,Captivating,Once you pick up this book you won't be able to put it down! It is a wonderful reminder of the little things that make or break relationships. Definitely a must-have.
1,My cat didn't like it,"There seemed to be mixed reviews on this product, but I decided to give it a try for my finicky cat. She would not even try it. One sniff and she walked away. I will offer it to my other cats, so it gets used, but for me, it was a waste of money."
3,Your mileage may vary,"Make sure your cats will eat this before buying multiple quantities. I have three cats and one was a bit underweight, needing the caloric supplement. He wouldn't touch this stuff, and neither would one of the others. Only one of my cats would consume this, so the descriptor of it being ""highly palatable"" is questionable. Temptations cat treats on the other hand, I haven't come across a single cat that can resist those!"
1,Good luck,I bought four tubes of Nutrition-Cal. Based on other reviews. I guess I have EXTREMELY finicky eaters. Neither would eat it and both made horrible faces at the smell! One will eat anything....except this!I can't rate it as good or bad ... Just disappointed it didn't work.
4,Cat loves this stuff,"My cat loves the Nutri-Cal. This animal is a finicky persian cat that can only eat chicken. She vomits if we feed her any other type of meat. She has always kept down Nutri-Cal and I think it contributes to the fact that she does not have hairball surprises. What I do not like is that it can separate if kept too long or in warm weather, so when I squeeze the tube, sometimes a pool of oil come out."
2,NOT THE SAME PRODUCT AS VET SELLS.,PICTURE OF PRODUCT IS NOT WHAT YOU RECEIVE. ORANGE COLORED TUBE IS WHAT I RECEIVED. MY CATS WOULD NOT EAT IT AND THEY LOVE THE VET PRODUCT. INGREDIENTS ARE THE SAME BUT THE TASTE MUST BE DIFFERENT. WASTED MY MONEY.
3,IT'S ALRIGHT,"I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT ""I LOVED AND I LOST"" IS NOT INCLUDED ON THIS CD. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE MILLENIUM COLLECTION, AND IT HAS ONLY 11 SONGS. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A DOUBLE DISC. I GUESS IT'S APTLY TITLED CURTIS MAYFIELD AND THE IMPRESSIONS BECAUSE IT HAS ""FREDDIE'S DEAD"" AND ""SUPERFLY"" ON HERE WHICH ARE CURTIS' BIGGEST HITS, NOT THE IMPRESSIONS. WHEN CURTIS WAS WITH THE GROUP, THEY WERE KNOWN AS SIMPLY THE IMPRESSIONS, NOT CURTIS MAYFIELD AND THE IMPRESSIONS. THIS DISC DOES NOT EVEN HAVE THE IMPRESSIONS HIT SONG THEY SCORED WITHOUT CURTIS, ""FINALLY GOT MYSELF TOGETHER(I'M A CHANGED MAN)"" OR THEIR OTHER SONGS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN HITS. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST 2 CD'S SPANNING THEIR YEARS TOGETHER AS A GROUP. I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
4,Bette's take is fine with me.,"Enjoyable. As a Midler fan I knew it would be to my liking. My wish is that on her next cd, she pairs up with the talented newcomer, Michael Buble'. Now that would create magic!"
1,Bogus,"I'm sure the album itself is great, but the CD won't play on any of the equipment I have. Tried to play it in my vehicle (which is only 2 years old) and it won't play there either! Then, when I read the rules about returning items, I'm told that it has to be unopened!!! How stupid is that? How would I have known it was useless to me until I opened it and tried it? I'll never order CDs from this site again.RobertaAnchorage, AK"
2,'B' as in bomb,"I have no idea why folks are raving about this cd -- and I certainly hope bette doesn't read these boards! I love the woman and her music. But this is NOT her music -- since when did 'Fever' need a full band and a kitchen sink thrown in? Why does she rush through 'The Folks Who Live on the Hill""? Why didn't she include the intro? Who let her out of the studio after doing 'Is That All There Is?"" She is capable of doing better (meaning LESS) She should have been sent back to the drawing board on that one. What was she thinking with 'Big Spender'? Bright spots -- 'Happiness Is Just a Thing Called Joe' but she should have taken a few cues from Ethyl Waters and ""I'm a Woman"". I don't think she sounds relaxed -- she sounds sedated. I just dread the thought of her doing emough of this series to have an entire cd of duets with Barry Manilow.For a woman who can tackle a Ben Folds song (Boxing) I expect better. Ship this cd straight off to the elevators -- NOW."
3,not impressed,"bette is great, and be cursed anyone who says otherwise! but this very compilation, I believe, lacks cencerity, passion, truthiness, so to say:)"
2,"I love Bette, but...","I cannot tell you how disappointed I was in this album. I love Bette Midler and think she is one of the greatest entertainers we have today. But, my impression of this album was that she came into the studio, sang a few Peggy Lee songs, told them where to send the check and went home. To add insult to injury, there isn't a photo or anything else on the CD itself, just barely legible ""This side up."" Sorry Bette, in the future I'll stick to you singing your own material."
2,"Disappointed , but your next cd project sounds exciting!","I am a long time Bette fan, but feel that most of her albums don't have enough good songs on them. I only own 2 Bette Albums, No Frills (her best) and Rosemary Clooney songbook. Of course she has other good songs, but her other cd's don't have enough good songs on them to keep. Sadly, that's the case with her new cd: Peggy Lee Songbook. 7 of the songs are boring. I think she made a mistake with the song choices. And her singing is flat and boring on most of them. The best song is the duet with Barry. I heard that she wants to do a Laura Nyro tribute cd. If she does, I hope she picks a different producer, maybe someone like: Richard Perry, Steve Levine, or Nile Rodgers."
3,Sings the Peggy Lee Songbook,Was happy with the album. I was however disappointed with the CDside of the album as this was the first combo DVD/CD that I have purchased and was unable to play the CD side in any of my CD players. The CD would however play on my PC or DVD player.
4,Brilliant tribute to Miss Lee...,"The Divine Miss M follows up one spectacular tribute (to Rosie Clooney) with this one...the songs of Miss Peggy Lee are perfect for this great voice. Thanks to Barry Manilow and a great team of musicians and arrangers for helping Bette create this fine effort!!!A couple of downsides - the album clocks in at just over a half-hour, and I only wish that a few more of Miss Lee's gems were included (""Manana"" would have been up Miss M's alley). Loved the CD/DVD concept - and the DVD (with insights from Miss Lee's daughter and granddaughter) more than makes up for it."
4,A FINE TRIBUTE TO AN AMERICAN LEGEND!,"EVERYTHING BETTE DOES IS PERFECTION.GREAT VOICE,GREAT MUSIC...MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS CD IS IT JUST ISN'T LONG ENOUGH!"
2,Going through the motions,"The song arrangements are good and Bette sounds as lovely as ever... however once again I feel a little cheated ... this is the 2nd CD in the ""Bette Sings"" collection - the 1st one - Rosemary Clooney, lasted under 30 minutes, and this one lasts 33 Minutes ... in an age where most CDs run for 50 to 60 it is a disappointing output, I feel a bit cheated to be charged a full price for what is a 50% CD! Part of me thinks that the record company knows that us true Bette fans will buy anything she puts out .. after this cd I will think long and hard next time."
4,Peggy Lee Songbook,"Loved the songs. Love Bette Midler. However, after I played the CD on my computer once, I couldn't get it to play again. Don't know if there was something wrong with the CD because I played the other CD's that I received from Amazon that day and they were all fine. Not worth the hassle of sending back the Peggy Lee Songbook."
5,I love being here with Bette,"Bette follows up her tribute to friend Rosemary Clooney, with a tribute to the great Peggy Lee. This set may not be as adventurous as the Rosie tribute, as the arrangements are very traditional (which suites these songs), however this is still a wonderful album. The ballads ""the folks who live on the hill"" and Harold Arlen's lovely ""happiness is just a thing called Joe"" are simply stunning and two of Bette's finest ever vocal performances. ""fever"" (revelatory interpretation) and ""he's a tramp"" come up a treat, and ""I am w-o-m-a-n"" is the divine Miss M in all her glory. Bette's been recording standards since `am I blue"" on her first album (1972) and with the possible exception of Linda Ronstadt no rock singer sings the standards better then Bette and this album is a testament to that. Great songs, great arrangements, great singing, great album and a lovely tribute to a dearly missed singer (and songwriter)."
3,Bette Midler sings Peggy Lee,"Wonderful songs by a great singer. To be honest, I would just as soon have this CD with these songs sung by Peggy Lee.If an artist mixes up several old songs by various artist, I don't have the vision of just one performer. As I was listening to this CD, I kept seeing Peggy Lee. Maybe this CD would be best suited to those too young to remember her."
2,Midler and Manilow miss the mark,"Omigod, this reminds me of Jinxed, a lackluster effort following a previous fantastic performance. Like most folks, I found the Clooney tribute way too short but very, very well done, in fact it's one of my favorite Bette albums. This endeavor however, well, I've listened to it 4 times yesterday and 3 times today and I just don't get it - once again, half a CD's worth of music but worse, what's here is flat and thinly produced - Manilow, are you sure you worked on this release? This one will join Bette Of Roses in my ""rarely listened to"" section of my Midler collection."
3,10 Songs Only? I feel cheated!,"Bette Midler's tribute to the legendary Peggy Lee could have been so much better since I have several compact disc collections featuring the legendary Peggy Lee. She had sung perhaps thousands of songs in her own unique way. While Bette has only selected ten for this collection, I feel like there should have been more in a retrospective of the great Peggy Lee's life. Peggy Lee had several recordings especially a great Christmas sound.While I appreciate Bette's tribute to the late Miss Peggy Lee, I felt that I would have been better off buying a Peggy Lee Compilation. It would have been nicer for Midler to explain why this song was an inspiration whether in the insert or on the compact disc. Bette is a great performer of star caliber and these tributes to the legendary vocalists like Peggy Lee and Rosemary Clooney could have been better and more."
1,Great CD .. if it will play,"This is a very good CD .. if it will play. Being a dual disk, I found out the hard way that it won't play the CD side in either drive on my computer. Oddly, it plays just fine in my ancient 15 year old Sony 5-CD changer. For Bette Midler (and Peggy Lee) fans, the music is great! Just beware that it may not play in your computer's CD drive(s)."
2,just kinda there,"I have always dug&Respected Barry Manilow as a Producer&Arranger,but here there just ain't much magic.Bette Midler&Barry must have been watching the&I cough when i say this the Re-invention of Rod Stewart as a crooner taking on Past classics&whatnot.please don't let Rod Stewart be your vocal Role Model.this Album is real predictable&doesn't take either Bette's vocals nor Barry Manilow's Production or Arranging style anywhere.this Project would have been better suited for another female vocalist. Peggy lee got a style that ain't easy to duplicate."
2,HARDLY A BEST BETTE,"Bette Midler is trying hard to be the white Ella Fitzgerald --- first a tribute songbook to Rosemary Clooney (an acceptable accomplishment), and now a tribute to the woman with fever. But this is far from a best Bette. It was musical director and guest vocalist Barry Manilow --- his arrangements are marvelous --- who suggested the divine Miss M do this recording; Bette's lack of Lee's depth and accomplishments show. ""Fever"" is finger-snapping imitation that never hits its mark; ""Is That All There Is?"" has Midler excessively emoting in a way in which Lee never did; even through Bose speakers, it's so over-the-top it's embarrassing. If Happiness is a Thing Called Joe, then where's Jo Stafford when we need her?"
1,Expected better,Because I like Bette Midle I purchased the CD. It was so bad I could not listen to the entire CD. Bette has her own style and should have stuck with it rather than try to imitate Peggy Lee. Giving it one star is being kind.
2,Very Plain.,"I am a fan of both Peggy Lee and Bette Midler. It's extremely ambituous to do a disc on the signature tunes of Peggy Lee. From a marketing point of view, it makes lots of sense. But from a musical point of view, you have nobody to measure to but Pegge Lee herself. And did Bette prove that she can carry the tunes just as well as Miss Lee? The answer is no. The CD is well recorded and well produced and Bette's voice is fine. However, there is no spark, and her renditions fail to provoke any of the sexiness, insinuating, and sometimes non-chalant attitude that Pegge Lee exhibited so well in her signature tunes like ""FEVER"", ""BIG SPENDER"", ""IS THAT ALL THERE IS""..."
4,A Best Bette,"The joy of Bette Midler is that she is always herself no matter what material she's performing. I found it refreshing that she didn't attempt to copy the sound of Peggy Lee (as a few other ""reviewers"" here seem to be expressing). That would have been pointless. Bette is in great form and voice. When Peggy Lee sang these songs, she did it in her own cool style. Bette sings them with sizzling sass and that's divine."
5,Such a riveting read!,"I enjoyed this book so much that I pull it out and read it over and over again on those lonely winter nights..........OR, I bought it for a college class, got a good price, and the book shipped and arrived on time.Whichever you prefer."
1,Thinly disguised vehicle for tired liberal complaints,"The author was not content to simply write a book about recreation. The book is loaded with political editorializing, including a section blaming the Detroit riots of the 60's on ""society"", constant harping about the inequalities of the recreation opportunities for rich and poor, and a pervasive hostility towards private recreation resources. I do not recommend the book at all except as a mildly amusing piece of trite socialist hogwash."
2,Not powerful enough,"I bought this a few years ago for work.I keep the volume all the way up, but 37 db is not enough for my loss and I wear two hearing aids with telephone coils at that! I don't hear most of what the callers are saying. The ring is extra loud; it makes my clients jump!What I use at home is a Clarity cordless with up to 50db. True, at that higher volume, there is distortion and I still miss a whole lot, especially on business phone calls.The neck loop can help, if you're wearing two hearing aids...two ears are better than one!"
5,FABULOUS!!,"EXCELLENT FIT AND QUALITY IS GREAT, MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASED, ONE OF HIS XMAS GIFTS. THANK YOU."
4,Sizing can be an issue,"Well made with a nice elegance appeal, but sizing can be an issue. Medium is closer to being a small so you may wish to upsize your order."
4,Its Different...,"I bought this series on the presumption that it was all historical but half way through the series it switches to modern day Tokyo, this isnt a bad point, just a very interesting plot twist. This was an intriguing series but not quite what i was expecting, for the most part, it is well animated, its by production IG, and the detial is quite nice too. I was expecting something alot more politically heavy than i found because of reviews i read but instead found a spiritual mystery with a good measure of heian period politics mixed in for good measure lol. All that aside i liked it, its not as cerebral as i would have liked but good none the less. The characters are well realised and the way they interact is quite good too, i have quite a soft spot for Kintaro... This is not comparable to ninja scroll, both entirely different except for the the time period. Basically, if you want something a bit different from the normal samurai slasher give this a look, its worth your time."
2,not really sub-lingual/ do not dissolve,"Maybe i got a bad batch...they don't really dissolve. They just turn into a mushy, gritty mess, which you have to swallow."
1,A Summer of My Discontent,"This book started off with a dismal view of the time period. Well, it was a dismal time so maybe that was realistic. Unfortunately the story then became peopled with nasty one dimensional victims who you were not inclined to mourn.The plot twisted and turned and finally tied itself into knots.Nothing made sense; nothing was believable and I gave up before I finished. Something I rarely do. But my reading time is valuable and I didn't want to waste it.Sorry - I really wanted to like this book. I love a good mystery - especially historical ones and I would then get to read everything else this writer has published - but not this time."
1,not worth the money,"I was required to purchase this for an MBA class and it was worthless! It was hard to figure out how to use, didn't have the business type we were needing and kept locking up my laptop. I should have gone with my gut instinct and not even bothered purchasing this."
3,"Ok for Linux beginners, but...","those of us more experienced with operating systems may want to consider other linux distros which are available at no cost. I have Debian installed and it has the same capabilities as Linspire. If you really must try Linspire, download the free live cd version (available as ISO, just burn the image to a cd and you can try it without installing it.) If you like it, then go ahead and purchase it. The live cd is available at http://tracker.linspire.com/torrents/linspire_live_5.0.69.torrent."
1,"Get ubuntu, forget this...","If you need easy to use, well composed Linux distro take Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Fedora, OpenSuSe or debian. This distro has no much to offer, plays as trojan and way thinner than better developed distros. Don't waste your time with his one. If you need start fast get Ubuntu and it offers MUCH MORE for MUCH LESS!"
4,The Adolescence of P-1,"Who would of thought that a simple mathmatic paper about how to teach match boxes to win ""tic-tac-toe"" would lead to the demise of a program's programmer attacking the IBM supervisor!"
4,Ignore the editorial,"The editorial is misleading. These tracks are actually on Ayreon's Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer, which is a full album sold separately from Flight of the Migrator. While Part 2 is primarily heavy progressive metal (and excellent at that), Part 1 (where these four tracks originate) is much more on the lite prog side. Think Spocks Beard and Lana Lane and you'll get the idea. Lots of heavy keys, smooth vocals, and more about atmosphere than banging heads and crunching guitars. It's still top notch music - just don't think you're getting unreleased metal tracks from the more popular Part 2."
4,yamaha yst-sw315 sub piano black,"I rated the yamaha sub four and half stars.!!! The only reason I did not give it five,getting it set up . But with a little time and reading instructions it worked out fine.I have the Yamaha rxv2700 net. recever.With this sub it`s a match made in heven. the piano black box is a beautiful peace of work,it blends in well with rest of the furniture in the room. Most importantly the sound of the sub can be earth shakeing.and smooth as a baby`s bottom.This sub sounds alot bigger than it realy is.IN ALL I LOVE IT!!! I would tell anyone with high powered amp. try it you might love it too."
1,Lousy Communication,"I ordered this product November 7, 2005. I have been strung along saying the delivery day will be next week and then the next week and then the next week. I actually believed this and still wanted it because my grandson wanted it so badly. It is now supposed to be delivered next week in April. Today when I checked the status of this order it says (for the first time) that it is out of stock and not available. If I had been told the truth from the beginning I could have ordered it somewhere else so I am very unhappy with this lousy service!!! I wrote customer service and they excused it with some weak reason and basically let me know it was my problem."
1,"The worst reference, or source book, I have EVER seen!","This is, without a doubt, the WORST source book , or reference book, I have ever seen. The (authors?) have simply taken Hollywood scripts and copied ANY phrases that appeared, without any sense of value or importance. In all honesty, would a quote such as ""ouch!"", or ""Have a nice day!"" qualify as worthy of note..or reference?? The amazing thing is how or why, the publishers EVEN BOTHERED with this trash!"
2,"Entertaining, but severely lacking","This book provides some mild entertainment value, but it is far from a comprehensive guide. There are so many striking omissions both in specific quotes and in films themselves. At the same time, there is included a multitude of useless and unmemorable quotations. The only redeeming quality of this ""dictionary"" is as a source of random nostalgia. It might provide amusement at a party on Oscar night, but it is not to be mistaken for a reference book."
1,"""The Dictionary of Film Quotations""","Terrible and worthless book. The chosen quotes are banal.Most important, in a book about film quotations -- they list the director and the film's star -- but don't bother to list the WRITER! The writer! You know, the PERSON WHO WROTE THE QUOTES! ..."
1,Disappointing. Padded with banal quotations.,"Really disappointing book. The cover claims ""6,000 Provocative Movie Quotes"", but ""How do I look?"" or ""A doily"" hardly qualifies as ""provocative"". The authors say they aimed for `balance', but who wants `balance' in a reference book? I expected a collection of memorable quotations that could stand alone, not leave me thinking, `maybe it sounds better in the movie'. Sure, there were some good quotations, but the aim seemed to be for quantity, not quality. I, too, found many of the quotes to be banal, unimportant, and unmemorable - not to mention, downright boring. This book is destined for my yard sale."
2,I don't trust this book,"This book at times seems like nothing more than a 130 page advertisment for Snap-On tools. The authors are so in-your-face about it I almost question their impartiality: Are these adjustments and measurments they recommend really necessary or is it just that Snap-On makes a nice new - and very expensive - tool that they are trying to sell to help you do it? I don't know.It's really pretty silly considering that if I could afford Snap On tools I wouldn't have bought this book in the first place. I would have just driven my Camaro to John Lingenfelter's shop and told him to build me a smokin' 383, drop it in, and let me know when it's done."
2,helps but cord is too short,"it does help connect quicker, but the cord is only 2 meters. so, the only place to run it is out the passenger door and up on the roof. and if a passenger turns down the sunvisor, the cord will drop into their face. even my XM radio external antenna was 25 feet. With that I was able to run it along the trim, hidden, then out the trunk. Too bad the Magellan antenna wasn't longer. Oh, and the plug itself is some proprietary thing, so you can't find an extension."
1,Spooky Sounds Rip Off,"This item makes itself look like it is a digital version of the tape that was produced and sold by Hallmark. It is NOT. This has 6 unmarked tracks of spooky sounds that more or less is the same on every track! This does NOT contain the Sound Trak recordings of the Munsters, The Adams Family, etc.DO NOT PURCHASE this CD if you are looking for Spooky Sounds from Hallmark!!!!!"
5,Made a great Christmas gift,I got this for my parents and also for my mother in law and it was a hit for all of them. They were very happy because they had never seen these at the stores.
1,Don't bother,"This book is shockingly terrible. I am not one for online reviews. . . .but I could not help myself here. The color images are low resolution, the data on the buildings partial and incomplete. Many buildings featured are much apart of public record and one might find more from a design blog. Other than that, many are totally tacky. . . other books are available on the topic and I would say lean towards them."
2,Not a good clasp,"I bought this for my gf. It's nice for the price, but the clasp NEVER holds. It comes off ALL the time."
4,58 pages - very good,A short book about the things commonly viewable by a microscope that are found in pond water. Very interesting.
5,It does what it says,"I got this for my grand-daughter, who is 9 years old. She had no interest in it, but I won't let her disinterest diminish my rating. I thought and still think it is great for someone between 9 and 14, and beneficial to a lesser degree to someone in high school; a more advanced edition can be written for such people. Of course individuals vary, so some like my grand-daughter need to wait until maybe 14 to find herself more interested, as she matures. But some even 7 years old may be interested. Perhaps boys are more naturally interested at a younger age, on average. My advice is to talk to a young one first, to determine the degree of his/her interest, before buying any book on the subject."
3,Misleading title for the book....,"The book, ""A World in a Drop of Water: Exploring with a Microscope"" is a well written description of the world of microscopic animals found in water. It is well written on a basic level. However, the sub-title, ""exploring with a microscope"" is misleading. Besides a historical description about the origins of the microscope, there is nothing in the book related to microscopes. There are no pictures of microscopes, or even simple details on their use. There is little to connect the book to the microscope for young children. Even a picture of a child looking into a microscope would help make the content more related to the title."
5,Wonderful,"The school does not teach my 6 year old microscope exploration. I wish I had one of these when I was young, but then gas was 23 cents per gal."
3,A good Primer,An OK book for those interested in what is in that pond or lake water. It would have been better with more illistration and actual pictures.
2,"good title, weak book","I was hoping for more of a ""how to"" book on collecting things to look at under my new microscope. Instead the book shows black and white photos, many from Carolina Biological Supply, with poorly annotated and difficult to read names of parts of the microscopic plants and creatures.The text describes the the different objects but is little help in walking budding scientist through the collection and preparation process."
3,"Good content, poor pictures","I was disappointed in this book because the pictures, for this day and age, are minimal. They are not very sharp and clear, nor colored as one might expect them to be from looking at the cover. There are many of them, but color would have been so welcome. The content is good, and we will see if it can hold the attention our my 3,4, and 6 year old grandchildren who enjoy science and biology. I considered sending it back, but am hoping they will take to it for the content if I spend quality time enticing them."
3,Not in color,"Only the cover is printed in 4-color. All text pages are B&W. Was disappointed, although the small book is informative for younger children who are just getting started using their own microscopes."
4,history ????,This book was well worth the money There are some serious mistakes when dealing with history. other then that a very usefull book.
3,Very GOod,I liked it. It was very good. I am better after watching it. Buy it. It will prove to be an educational experiene
2,"Nice coasters, but pic is not as bold as represented","Coasters are typical of the Thirstystone brand, which are always very nice. But the pictures it depicts on the stone just aren't as bold as they should be, or represented on the site. I am a little displeased at that, and I'm not sure if I'm sending these back or not yet. I just may send them back. I also purchased the Thirsty stone ""Wine Picnic""Set of 4 Absorbent Coasters - Wine Picnicset, which were very beautiful and the print was bold on the stone as represented, they were nicer in my opinion as far as the quality of the graphic. I wish these were better. Can only give it a 2 star due to the graphic quality wasn't great, it was very ""grainy"" in appearance . I've included a photo to hopefully show what I'm speaking about. As far as functionality, they are great.For almost $22, this is not a quality set. Will most likely look for another to replace this one. Which is a bummer, as I liked the graphic of wine and cheese."
2,"Elementary, not explanatory, out-of-date!","This book is a beginner's book. Not all bad, but certainly lacks depth. Written just like the MS Windows stuff - here's how to do it. No discussion of why. Many examples, but they can be arbitrary and there is no discussion of what situation the author targeted the example to. Thus, many would be left to think that system administration of Linux is black and white.Also, this book is aimed at RedHat 6.2. Nobody has used that in years. It's almost irrelevant. The print chapter never discusses CUPS or XPRINT - it only covers the traditional lp and lpr print systems. The networking chapter was OK - but lacked any depth, no good discussion on routing and the examples were so limited that they would only work for a narrow situation.Don't buy this book, unless you buy mine from me! :-)I had an Amazon gift certificate, so I did not loose much."
1,"big book, small value","This really is more of a beginners book and not one I would say is for a system administrator. In addition, like every linux book I have found so far, it is distro specific. I will continue to search for a good linux book which spends most of it's time at the command prompt using universal commands instead of the GUI of a specific distro employing a specific GUI."
2,"Great Information, too much fluff","The Book ""Solar Rain "", By Mitch Battros is an interesting read. The science brought forth and correlated with historical records can lead one to put weight in his conclusions. The message is well worth consideration. Even though the premises for the book are well worth continued investigation I feel the book is poorly written. It seems to be more of a collection of past posting of his own work. Some of the chapters appear to be revisits of previous chapters and points with many implied ""I told you so's"". If he wishes to recieve greater scientific respect for his work he may wish to consider more science and less fluff and repetition."
4,Positive Attitude,"Themes: community, extended familyContent areas: elementary K-3, Writing- 1st person, imagination, end punctuation, Art- visual expression, Guidance- positive attitude, special talents, respectFun family trip to the beach story, where everyone has a special talent and makes the best of difficulties that arise.Muth's illustrations are truly what make this book come together. He is a master at relaying a variety of moods and emotions in each characters facial and body expressions."
2,Not for me,"""Hope"" is a kind of biography. It's a tale of a poor Irish family making good in the American gold rush, and what happens to them afterwards. The author Mary Ryan is actually one of their descendants and she has obviously put a lot of work into the research. However she has also filled in the gaps with some speculative fiction. Rather risky.I can imagine many people liking it, but personally I got bored. It's overlong, and the irksome martyr complex that seems to bedevil most work by Irish authors about Ireland crops up."
1,Very predictable,"The first half was fairly interesting, though predictable. The second half was, quite frankly (yawn, yawn) rather boring. I'm a lover of historical fiction, but I do like the book to keep me engaged. This book book failed to do that. I'm on page 360 of 468 pages and the Hope Diamond has yet to be mentioned.... Maybe the title is a mistake? You can feel safe giving this book a miss."
4,Enjoyable Read!,"Love the book. Have connections to both Washington, D. C. and Clonmel, Co. Tipperary in Ireland. Knew the story and like the author's treatment of the Walsh Family's life trials."
3,What stupid packaging!,"The latest CD is nice soundwise, but it has the stupidest packaging I've ever seen. What genius thought this up? I listen to CDs in the car ... this ridiculous LP-style packaging prohibits me from carrying the jewel case, the songs or anything else about the CD. If I were Seal, I would dump this packaging immediately and send a copy of the jewel-case book to all Amazon clients who bought this. Amazon should drop this if Seal doesn't. The so-called ""special packaging"" is a big disappointment for most buyers."
1,Caution!,"This toy is dangerous. The hooks in front that hold dust pan and brush are sharp, immovable, eye-putter-outter, extended hooks. I felt it necessary to cut them off.This toy falls apart, the caps on the mops, etc, were never glued on, creating major small parts hazard.That being said, the kids love it, but I would never buy it again."
4,A Wonderful Mandie Book!,"A great book! Mandie is still traveling through Europe with Grandmother Taft, Senator Morton, Celia & Jonathan. They are renting a house in Holland, and Mandie finds a mystery, as usual. This time it involves a neighbors' windmill, a trip to the Delftweare factory, and Mandie's endless jumping to conclusions. This time Mandie gets herself into a predicment involving Snowball climbing on Windmill Blades.... Thankfully, good old, dependeble Uncle Ned shows up to save Papoose. The conclusion is an unusual one, and the book will keep you guessing 'till the end!"
5,Mandie and the Windmill's Message,"I love the Mandie books and this is a great book. In this early 20th century mystery, Mandie is in Holland with her Grandmother, and Mandie's best friend. Someone seems set on destroying the Delftware porcelain factory where they see blue paint used on the dishes turning green when somebody sabotages the mixture. And Mandie notices the windmill blades are in the wrong position at a windmill near the house where they are staying. You are always wondering how Mandie will unravel the mystery while the clues appear during this great adventure in Holland."
1,Cena sucks,Worst wrestler ever with the most annoying accent ever....No one cares about your life Cena or your future. If this is what passes for the future of wrestling it's going to die fast.
2,Good DVD but unable to watch,"The DVD is good however I am unable to watch disc 1 due to the series coming to me defective and the seller said they didn't have anymore of them, be VERY careful when ordering this DVD as you may also get a defective one as well. Disc one was defective and it's hard to watch the DVD if you can't start with Disc 1, Disc one is about John Cena's life and I believe the rest are about his mathces he's had from day 1"
1,Boring.,John Cena isn't even that great of a wrestler. If you have seen him wrestle then you don't need this dvd...you have pretty much seen it all. And his life is boring as well. Who cares!!!!
5,great,Ordered this DVD for my 9 year old for his birthday. He loves it. Great value for the price. Was delivered in just a few days. Highly recommended.
1,poorly crafted and easily broken,"I've gone through two of these tripods because i desperately wanted it to be as good as i'd imagined. Unfortunately the product is poorly built and both of mine came apart easily when trying to wrap it around something. The joints crack easily and i discovered pre-existing cracks in both of mine. I don't know a better product to recommend, and i'd love it if this one worked as i imagined, but unfortunately it just wasn't worth the hassle."
5,THIS IS THE GREATEST!,"I LOVE THIS CD, THE MUSIC IS SO RELAXING AND ENJOYABLE. THE SAXOPHONE IS SO SMOOTH, ALL OF KERRY STRAYER'S CD'S ARE DEFINITELY WORTH GETTING. I HOPE THEY HAVE A NEW CD THIS YEAR!"
2,Not so good,"I don't know why they call it usa dance videos, it's all foriegn artists and it's ok for workout but don't not good for house parties"
3,Didn't move me as much as it used to,"It's a shame I can't go back to my youth for this review.I read the Death of Captain Marvel about 25 years ago, and it really moved me.Remembering that, I looked for it again, and ordered the hardcover edition. My old copy was lost in a move.Well, it just didn't do as much for me. I think it was the deaths in my real life that have taken away the impact. Still, Starlin is a great writer, and I do recommend it. Perhaps, it will mean to you, what it used to mean to me."
3,It's good but not durable.,"We love this sleep sheep as it has the sound of nature that our daughter likes. It keeps her calmed and helps her sleep by herself. It is very cute.Pro: - you can wash the stuff animal / sheep. (you can take the electronic part of it out).- it has 4 different sounds of natures.- it's small and light, so you can hang it to the crib.Con: - the longest duration of the noise maker/sound only 45 minutes.- sometimes the turn on dial does not work as it should. It keeps shutting it off by itself even though we change the batteries. We have turned it all the way off, and waited for a few seconds, then turned it back on.We have to buy another one since the other one is having issue (keeps shutting off by itself), and we keep one at the daycare and one at home. Over all it is very good item to have."
4,Cloud b Sheep,"Won't put a 10 month old to sleep but, does a good job of keeping her occupied during a ride in the car."
5,Can't live without!,"I had wanted to order the larger size one and didn't realize that I had ordered the smaller one. I was glad because it is the perfect size for my baby. I can attach it to her carseat, crib, or anywhere. I didn't like the fact that there were whale songs instead of heartbeat but my baby loves the whale songs and that is what see uses to fall asleep. It really calms her we take it everywhere with us. I don't know what we would do if I forgot it anywhere. I am so happy with it and plan on buying the larger one and the lavendar lab too."
4,"overall great, wished it had continuous play","Our favorite is stream actually, we have the travel size. Second favorite would be the ocean sound. Baby falls asleep on it but doesn't really stay asleep as it just shuts off instead of fading away when time is up."
2,"Great sounds, needs a plug.",I like the sounds and the cute stuffed animal but it stops after 45 min! I need something to go all night. I live in a small house so I need to drown out the noise my 3-year old makes. Just make one that doesn't turn off!!
3,Love it but it broke,"This Sleep Sheep is the perfect size, especially for traveling in the car or on the stroller. However, 3 months into using it, it has broken and won't play any more, even after changing the batteries. :-("
5,Love My Sleep Sheep,"Nope, didn't buy it for a child, bought it for me. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble getting back to sleep. The soothing sounds from the sleep sheep help me get back to sleep fairly quickly. The batteries last a very long time, I have had this for over 6 months and haven't had to change the batteries yet. My favorite sound is the sound of the stream."
4,Wish it played longer,This is a great portable sound machine. Buy the smaller one (the larger one is way too large). The velcro straps lets you hook it onto virtually anything. The sound quality is pretty good and loud (we mostly did the waves). My main complaint is that it shuts off too soon (43 min. is the longest). As soon as it shut off my daughter would wake up so we actually had to invest in a plug in sound machine that played cont. (rec. the marpac but if you don't want to spend that much then go with the graco). This works for travel and in the stroller or carseat.
2,"Great idea, faulty product","We were excited to get the Sleep Sheep after reading all of the positive reviews here. The sheep itself was cute and very easy to operate. We used it several times a day for naps and bedtime and it worked great...for about three weeks. Then the sound started to cut out, and eventually died entirely. I thought it must be the battery so I changed the battery. No change.The sound would work for a few seconds, or sometimes even a minute or two, and then would cut out unexpectedly. We found the sound worked better on some settings (the whale noises) rather than others. Sometimes if we fiddled with the volume, we could get it to work for longer. Other times, nothing we did could get the sounds to play for more than a second or two.After a couple of weeks, we just gave up. I was really disappointed, because otherwise we thought it was a great product."
3,"For the price, needs to be more durable","My daughter absolutely loves her sheep. We bought her the big one as well. But the problem is, is that they obviously get dirty if your child has t all the time, and you can never really get it clean. Even when you put it through the washer it stays dingy once dirty. For the price, I would like it to be a more durable material"
5,Awesome Sleep Sheep!,"The Sleep Sheep is awesome- volume control knob (not only high & low), four nice sounds we love, a super convenient velcro strap, and very soft! The people complaining about it having a max time of 45 minutes: it is probably better for you and your baby not to have her/him get used to sleeping only with constant sound. We use it for fussy days, and it works great. Somehow, our parents didn't play music all night, and yet we survived infancy--imagine that!"
4,Best for travel and stroller,"We had the Sleep Sheep for our son when he was a newborn and it was awesome...as mentioned by others, however, the main drawback was the automatic shut off after either 22 or 45 minutes. On the other hand, when used in the stroller, it kept outside noise from waking him and allowed me to time his naps, which was nice.To provide all night long ""white noise"" we purchased the Marpac Sleep conditioner machine and it has been awesome (it's unfortunately really ugly, but I decorated it with stickers) At 14 months our little guy no longer naps in the stroller, but the sleep sheep on the go has been retired with full honors."
3,Has its limitations,"Giving this a 3 because it does not have continuous play as an option, it shuts off at 23 or 45 mins. The sound quality if fine, product is cute and soft and easily attaches to things. WOuld not buy again or recommend simply because you do not have the option to leave it on all night."
5,Little one and I love it!,We have this on our daughter's crib and we play it every night. The sound cues her to know that it is bed time. We even take it with us when we travel and she always knows what it means when she hears the soothing sounds! Great investment!
2,Quiet,"The 45 minutes timer is a joke. And it is VERY quiet. Very cute, but far from perfect. I would recommend investing into any radio with white noise selection, an iPod dock or a cd player would be a nice bonus, as your kid can use this radio even after he/she outgrows the light sleeper phase."
2,Flawed,"The problem is that I don't want it to stop at 45 minutes. I would rather have the option to stop NEVER! At least, to leave it going for at least eight hours. Because sometimes, when it stops abruptly after one of its preset number of minutes, baby wakes up. And that's frustrating. I can't believe they would not give you the option to run for a full sleep cycle, basically."
2,"cute, but no help","This item is cute and portable. However, it does nothing to help my son get to sleep. It is effective in helping him stay asleep, until it stops. If it had a continuous function it would be good, but as soon as the 45 minutes runs out, he's awake. Save your money..."
3,Needs to stay on longer,"Really like the sounds this makes but it will only stay on for 40 minutes before automatically turning off. Our newborn will start to wake up as soon as the sound goes off so I am off looking for a white noise machine that will stay on all night.Also, the sheep is not necessary, especially for a newborn. We never even put the noise maker in the sheep."
5,Love this sheep,"The standard one is too big for my taste, but I love this one! I have gifted this to 4 babies now and everyone loves it. I generally gift 4 or 5 items to each person for a baby shower and once the baby arrives, this is the item people talk about. Definitely worth every penny and is adorable."
2,Not too durable,"While I would love to give this more starts, mine broke less than a month after I purchased it. The sounds though are quite soothing to a baby but the durablity is questionable."
2,stopped working after a few months,"my daughter slept with this for 4 months all the time then it suddenly started making weird noises like the batteries run out. we changed the batteries, but there weren't the cause of the problem."
2,not loud enough - no continuous play,"Pros:cutecuddlyattaches to crib or infant carseatCons:not loud enough!! (it's okay in a quiet room but not out and about, which is what I wanted it for)won't play all night long (this is what i needed to make it useful on vacation)all in all it is not useful for what i wanted it for which was 1. on the carseat and 2. travelbummer. wanted to love it!"
2,Why only work on a timer?,"You can't leave this on for more than 23 or 45 minutes. If you could leave it on for more than 45 minutes I think it would help create a better environment for a baby to stay asleep or soothe him/herself back to sleep when s/he wakes after 30-45 minutes. Why not just have an ""On"" setting? Pretty silly design flaw"
3,Timer is annoying,This product is ok and as other reviews indicate is very portable and therefore good for travel. What is annoying is that the timer lasts no more than 45 minutes. Early on my kids would actually wake up when it went off. You should have the option to just leave it on as you would a standard white noise machine.
3,Not loud enough,I like this sound machine for travel and in the car but I don't think it is loud enough. I am using the Happiest Baby on the Block soothing methods and use it when trying to put the baby to sleep on the go but I can barely hear it when outside or in the car even on it's loudest setting. I took the sound machine out of the sheep and you can hear it a lot better but it makes the sheep a waste.
3,Great for car seat BUT NO continuous play!,"I would give this 5 stars except that it doesn't have a continuous play option! Why on earth would they make a sound machine to get babies to sleep and then turn it off after 23 or 45 minutes? Are they trying to make parents of newborns go crazy? The goal is to get our baby to sleep, not wake them up and once the sheep turns off!,,It's great otherwise and love that it is small and on the go. I like the rain the best but wish they had a white noise sound as well."
3,Nice addition to the bedtime routine,"We added this to our registry because so many friends have recommended it. I like the small size (and it is small, about 7 inches high). The beach/wave setting is our favorite. Our baby is a sound sleeper and doesn't seem to depend on the sleep sheep to fall asleep/stay asleep. I think it is more of a signal that it's time to nap/sleep. We haven't tried taking it ""on the go"" yet.Like others, our sound machine stopped working and our baby is only 4.5 months old! Thanks to the other reviewers for posting that the company will send a new insert. I've written for a replacement.I'm adding my review so that people are aware that, while this is a great product, it may stop working after only a few months. If baby depends on this, waiting for the replacement would be really inconvenient!"
3,Sounds not listed!,My baby falls a sleep well with the heart beat sound so when I saw the lamb with the heart beat sound I was excited. Then I noticed that there was a travel size lamb. It did not list the sounds so foolishly I presumed that it had the same sounds since both showed 4 sound options. It does not!!!!! This item does not have the Heart Beat Sound! The Item works great and looks just like the picture. It arrived before estimated date which was great but really wish the sounds would have been listed.
5,Too soon,The little baby isn't due until May so I can't comment other than it is very cute. Delivery was prompt.
2,Boring.,"The sounds don't totally sound like what they are supposed to. Also my 1 yr. old, who loves stuffed animals, wanted nothing to do with it at all."
2,I should send this back.....,"This is the worst music/soothiing toy we have purchased.We have many as our daughter loves music and ocean sounds, but this one is horrible, i would not recommend this to anyone. It make for a cute stuffed animal and thats about it."
1,Not so soothing,I thought this would be perfect for my granddaughter and it was for a few hours...and then the sound machine stopped working. A waste of money.........
1,Very bad review !!!!,"Very disappointed,do not buy !!!My little daughter loved this thing. We used it every night for 3 month's until it suddenly stopped working in the middle of the night. We changed the batteries and followed the troubleshooting suggestions on cloud b's website and nothing worked."
4,A cute little lamb.,The sheep should be named a lamb because that's how small it is. The device with the sounds is stuffed into an opening in the side of the sheep and sticks out(i found it intrusive). The manufacturers should of put the sound machine on the inside of the toy and made it big enough for a baby/toddler to cuddle.
2,No continuous play mode :(,"I was so excited to get this product -- I live in a small apartment, and I was hoping it could stand in for a larger white noise machine. I didn't realize that there is no continuous play option for the sounds!! (Should have read the reviews first.) Its either 23 or 45 minutes, and then the sound abruptly turns off - doesn't even fade out. The abrupt turn off actually woke my daughter up! I'm so disappointed in this, and it would otherwise be such a great product."
4,Puts me to sleep too,"I think this is a great product. It seems to really work for my little one. I love how soft and cute it is, but it is also very functional. I like that it's small, so we can take it on the go. It has a velcro strap and we use it to strap it to the pack n play or the car seat. There's the option to take out the sound piece to make it even easier to transport.I agree with a previous reviewer who said that the rain and stream sounds are very similar. I can barely tell them apart. I usually use the waves sound. The whale noise is a little odd, but it's effective. This sound machine also helps lull my husband and I to sleep, which is an added bonus."
2,"Loved it, but defective","After trial and error with soothing and trying to get my baby down for naps and bedtime without crying and upset, I recently purchased the Sleep Sheep on the Go. Reviews had stated that the regular one was a bit large and we didn't feel we needed the heartbeat for my 16 month old. We love the sounds although the Whale recording is a short loop and not as good as we had hoped. The problem is that the one we received does not shut off automatically at the 23 or 45 minute intervalls. It also stopped working altogether and this happened the same day it arrived. I am requesting a replacement but we are disappointed in its workmanship as my baby just loves her Sleep Sheep!"
4,Sleep Sheep on the Go-,I purchased the sleep sheep on the go for my daughter. When it came in the mail from this seller it was the larger one. I love it but wish that they would make it clear when ordering it. I already have this one for my daughter and she loves it. She is 18 months old and still loves to use this product.
2,You can barely hear the sounds,"I got this cute set for my baby shower because I had heard wonderful things about it. The little sheep is very cute, but small in size. The little music adaptor slips in and out of the sheep and sometimes falls out, but that is not what I didn't like about it.The problem with it is that I can barely hear the sounds. You have only 4 choices and even when I turn the volume up to max, the baby can barely hear it. The sounds get drowned by the baby's kicking and cooing.It's definitely not worth buying, however, the blanket that cloud b offers might be good as compared to the sheep.I am thinking of using the sheep myself while doing yoga or something to create a calm environment.Hope this helps!"
5,"High Quality, Soothing and Adorable!","I purchased this for my newborn granddaughter and she loved it right away! The sounds are very soothing to her, and I especially like that you can set the volume as some products like this are much too loud. The timer is wonderful too so it will shut itself off. The sheep itself is very soft and just the right size. As you can see from all the other reviews, this little lamb is highly recommended and you won't be disappointed."
1,The warning states this isn't safe for kids under age 3!??!!,"I wanted to order this as a gift for a new baby but contrary to the purpose and the photos provided, the warning states that it is not for children under age 3. This makes no sense."
3,"Not a magic elixer, but still a good product","I had a very colicky baby that was very difficult to get to sleep for the first several months. After that much sleep deprivation, I was DESPERATE for anything that might help get him to sleep. So I bought this sheep hoping the white noise would help. It wasn't anything magical, but I do think he liked it. I'm not sure it made him fall asleep, but I do think it helped him stay asleep a bit longer. The white noise both helped mask our sounds when we were tiptoeing around the bassinet in our bedroom, and also helped provide nice background noise for sleeping for him. He mostly liked the rain noise. My baby also had a hard time with all the noise at daycare, so we brought this with him for naps and it helped drown out some of the ambient noise and encouraged him to keep napping. I think its a very useful product. I do think the small size is probably sufficient though, and frankly I wouldn't have wanted anything bigger in his crib."
4,My Baby Loves It,"She really likes the sounds, specially the whale and the water flowing.The size is perfect and you can separate the electric part to wash the toy!Excellent gift for a newborn!"
5,I LOVE this!,"I got this as a gift at my shower and it far exceeded my expectations. My son (3 weeks old) loves to be shushed, but that can be kind of hard to keep up continuously, especially when you want to get other stuff done. I just tried out the sheep and put it on the stream setting. It instantaneously calmed my son down. I like to think of the stream sound as similar to the sound your stomach must make inside, with tons of gurgling. I love that it has a dial for the volume and it actually gets loud enough to be effective. This is a great product!"
5,I Recommend,"I also agree that this model is suitable for home use. My daughter likes the Ocean sound, and will often turn to it while she sleeps in her crib."
3,"A necessity, but an imperfect one.","Our baby is a very light sleeper, and this product helps her fall asleep, as well as help her stay asleep.Therein lies the problem though. The sheep, in an effort to help the owner save on batteries, has a timing device that shuts the sound off automatically. The longest setting is for 45 minutes. So, after 45 minutes we either have to be on hand to turn it back on, or she will soon wake up because of her sensitivity to noise. I wish there was an ""infinity"" setting as well.So, the product works, but if your baby is very noise sensitive and wakes up easily, you may want to look for an option that works continuously."
3,Short life span,We have purchased 4 of these and all of them die within a few months. Changed the batteries they all have had a bad speaker. If my daughter wasn't so obsessed with it I would not continue to buy them. Reading the reviews it seems I am not the only one with this problem. Love everything else about it though.
4,Happy Little Nephew,"I bought this for my nephew. My brother wasn't convinced that it would help his new baby sleep at night, but little nephew showed him! I chose the travel size over the regular size because in the website pictures, the regular one looked enormous. Seriously. Bigger than the baby! This one attaches to baby's crib with velcro. My brother's family lives about 400 miles away, so I just had this shipped directly to them (thanks, amazon, for making it super easy to be a doting aunt from a distance!). I was amused when I saw it in person on a visit to find that most of the sounds are water-type sounds... rain, ocean waves, etc. I think if I had known that, I'd have gotten him the Cloud B dolphin. Not that it matters. (And anyway, what was I expecting--bleating noises?)"
2,"2 Timer Options, but No Continuous Play?!","I was hoping this would be the answer to our prayers and bought the full-sized and the travel-sized Sheep for our baby. Two things that make this not so great for us: (1) there is no option to just turn it on and let it play continuously. The only options are 23 and 46 minutes, then it shuts off... waking the baby! Timer option is nice, but should be just that, an ""option"". Anyone who has used a sleep aid for a baby should know that continuous play is required for many babies to get a good nights sleep or even a decent nap. Secondly, it does not have the basic white noise as one of the sounds, which happens to be what our baby likes the most and works the best. Disappointed for sure. Now I'm searching for a battery-operated sound machine with continuous play white noise! (Recommendations welcome!) The only good thing about this is that our baby likes to look at it... as for the sleep part.. not so helpful in our house."
1,Too many Errors !,Way too many Errors ! Cannot learn from this book. Samples from the CD won't compile either.
3,very disappointing!,"It seem to me that Mr. Weber was in a hury to put this book out. A lot of the materials are out of place and are presented with no introduction. He often has a hard time of explaining a complecated subject. Just take a look at chapter 13, on Threads. The CD is useless as well."
4,Excellent reference book for working Java programmers,"This is an excellent reference book, particularly if you have done some Java coding before and need a new reference for the latest release. The author knows what goes on under the hood, which makes his explanations both useful and interesting. He also points out areas where you can get in trouble, again reflecting his broad experience. There is a short introduction to Java Script at the end - just enough for Java programmers who need to do a bit of Java script on a web site."
3,"Typos, typos, typos.","The book is riddled with typographical errors. Plus, the cd DOES NOT contain the 1.2 JDK as is described within book! The book is rather thorough in its coverage of networking and advanced topics. It's fairly well written and reads easily."
2,Using Java 2 Platform: Special Edition,"I bought this book thinking that it covers most of the topics in JAVA but I was wrong. It does cover all the topics but not a single topic is covered well.... there are ""tons"" of errors in this book. Most of the time the book contradicts itself. I would recommend "" Java2: A Completee Reference"" by Patrik Noughton for the beginers and the advanced Java Programmers."
2,"Lots of typos, would make it hard for a beginner.","I bought this book after using BEGINNING JAVA by Ivor Horton (If Beginning JAVA 2 is as good, buy that instead). The book has numerous typos and errors. Not too bad for someone with experience to spot, but could be difficult for a ""fresh"" coder. A book like this shouldn't have typos (well not that many!) and the code should work ""straight off the page""!"
1,What a RIPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!,"If I could give this book a zero, I would. The main reason I bought this book was because the text in the book specifically said that the JDK was on the CD-ROM enclosed in back of the book. I even tried downloading the JDK off the internet and I had even more trouble. When I was finally able to install the JDK, I had trouble running most of the programs in the book. Take my advice, if you don't have the JDK, just buy the CD-ROM then install it on your computer from it and save yourself time and money by not purchasing this book. I expect coming up with problems while programming, but not while installing software god d@1313it! I just hate it when the author lies to the reader just to make a buck."
2,"Well, I would say, dealings were good.","I would say, again the CD for this book was cracked in countless pieces and makes this book useless for me. But the seller did a good dealing by refunding this time. So, I was able to purchase from another source.I liked the way they dealt with this one.vm"
5,Brilliant - a revelation.,"I have adored this Diva since age 12 in 1965 and ""I put a spell on you"". Strangely until I viewed this DVD I had not even been touched so forcibly by the human rights issues - yes I knew they were there but not one after another and another - NO! Blame me for living in UK!However, this DVD reinforces the strength of this great icon of the 20th century. I love and respect her even more now. The commitment and passion is so much more evident. Dr Simone - you are a saint - your approach laid the way for Barak."
5,First Class Job,"Reelin' In the Year productions are always first class. I have many of the Jazz Icon DVDs, Blues Festival DVDs, and their excellent Marvin Gaye, Temptations, and Stax Revue DVDs. (There's even more but you can look them up on their website). People are now trying to imitate them, but it's not quite the same, especially in the Jazz Icons area. These are the standard. You like Nina Simone? You'll love this DVD."
4,"hey you, buy this cd!","this cd is a must have for anyone who is into jump-up, considering aphrodite is the jump-up god. many people read too much into this cd, but why do that to a genre of music that is ment for strictly just dancing too and basically has no feeling(i'm gonna get it for that one)....the cd serves its purpous, especially with the track,""woman that roles"". of corse this cd doesn't even come close to going to see aphro spin at a party(like i did at holiday bass in new york), so go support the scene and see him live..."
5,Teach Yourself Beginner's French Grammar,This book is divided into 99 units that each explain a particular grammar point. Each unit is a page long with related exercises included. It especially appeals to me to be able to pick it up and learn small snippets of French Grammar at a time. This is a great companion for any learners of French.
5,So funny i almost wet my pants,This is the best practical joker handbook yet . The ones in here are a classic .I pulled a joke on my cousin on christmas eve[...]Well i hope you enjoy this book beacause it a very funny book. Get it today at your loacl library or bookstore. Have fun
2,"Very, Very Basic","I liked the book, but, it was written on the reading level of a 10 year old. It is very hard to take a book seriously that is this basic. There are better choices for Nascar books."
4,Interlude and Rature Soundtrack,"Since I can't seem to find the original soundtrack for Interlude, I tried this one. It is good. Not as good as the original, however.I don't know why no one can get the original from England where it still sells in the shops, but this will have to do until I take a trip there. The Interlude music is such great stuff for the memories.Rapture music is a new treat."
3,One Simple Problem with this version,What is truly missing from this so called soundtrack is Timi Yuro'sversion of Time Is Like A Dream (Interlude). Listen to it on YouTube.comit is just wonderful. I have her CD of this song but it is justslightly different from the original soundtrack from the movie.Skylar
3,"Old ""Skool"" Kung Fu!!","Funnmy enough, this is really good flick,,,but I'm not sure what to think of it. The picture and sound quality is fairly good!! The story line great, and easy to follow. The fight scenes amazing, however, after watching it, I was not eager to see it a second time. This is a really weired one for me. Alexander lo performed brilliantly, especially the scene when the monks ambushed him,,so they could show him there style of Shaolin kung fu!! Be assured whatching it you will not be boared,,however, I would not recommend you over spend on this one!!"
3,"Inspiring, but not a mountaineering guide","The loss of Todd Huston's leg was as horrible an experience as anyone could imagine, and his response to it is admirable. Viewed from that angle, this is a fine book. It suffers, however, from some jumbling and some factual errors (probably on the part of Huston's ghost writer). Most notably, he climbed McKinley as his first high point, not his 45th. Late in the book this can be discerned, but it makes things confused elsewhere. Some other goofs: notable climber Lou Whittaker becomes ""Lee"" in this book, and the huge crevasse often found at the top of an alpine glacier, a bergschrund, this book comically calls a ""bergstrom."" This is a fine inspirational book, but very weak if you're looking for information on mountain climbing. If there is to be a second printing I recommend that Todd get a fact checker to go over it."
2,inspiring ...,"Story is poorly written and waaay too much about God for this reader ... However, it is truly amazing what Todd has accomplished. That's the inspiration."
2,Wheel Nut,"This isn't a great nut, it got mangled up putting it on the car. The chrome flaked off and the nut bent and crushed. I don't know what material it's made out of but it will only look good if you don't actually use it. Also they were put on by hand, not using air tools. I took them off with an impact wrench and they looked like they had been through 60 yrs of use in about 4 minutes"
5,This Phantom's the Best,"Having tried and failed to retire from cooking, I seek out cookbooks that have clear instructions, an indication of the time it will take to prepare the dishes, and delicious food. Although I have shelves filled with cookbooks, I find myself turning to The Phantom Cookbook: it's the one that never fails to deliver superb results. The only thing improvement would be to have the Phantom herself in my kitchen! For entertaining or for the two in my household, I find everything I need in this book."
5,"One of the best ""Live"" albums ever!","The Bonus disk is so good that they could have sold that by itself (South California Purples, Sing A Mean Tune Kid, and 25 Or 6 To 4 rock the house)! I remember buying this album after it was released back in 1972. This music is classic, and Terry Kath was easily the best guitarist of his generation (besides Jimi Hendrix, of course). Danny Seraphine is one of the best rock and roll drummers of all time! And the rest of the band is so good, that most bands can't even compare (especially with a horn section like Chicago's)! Buy this 4-CD set now! You won't regret it! Every single song on here is off-the-hook!! What other band could release 3-double albums to start off their career, and then the ""Live"" compilation after that? Just absolutely incredible!!"
5,"Holy Cow!! 30+ years was too long to wait, but this is great!!","I always felt the Carnegie Hall set was a terrible recording. It was...originally. But this makes me excited, happy, and reaffirms why I used to love this band."
2,Poor audio quality,"I don't expect perfection from live recordings but I was surprised how bad the audio quality is; bass doesn't exist, horns sound tinny; AND THIS IS A REMASTERED SET! I wonder how bad it was before remastering?"
2,Great sounds,"I have seen Chicago many times....Before Terry Kath and after Terry Kath...If you are a before fan ,you need to get this great piece of musical history..."
5,live rock at its absolute greatest,"I used to hear Chicago a lot when I was in the 5th grade and this recording brings back some old memories. This collection was recorded in front of a very excited audience and the sound quality is very clear. I enjoyed all the songs including ""Colour My World,"" ""Make Me Smile,"" and ""Does Anybody Really Know What Time it Is?"" However, my favorite song on the recording is ""25 or 6 to 4."" I have enjoyed that song since I was in elementary school. The best part of this collection is listening to Peter rock out with his lead vocals on ""25 or 6 to 4."" I would recommend this recording to all fans as well as those just getting introduced to this group."
2,wrong product,"sent me wrong CD...slow to respond to email, though finally sent me a return label. Won't deal with Music-Mars again."
4,Good live album - done extremely well in this CD age,"My father has the LP's of this album and being a lover of Chicago, I've often wondered about this album. The 'live-ness' of this album isn't great and tends to wander a little bit, but the 'raw-ness' of the music I thinks makes this a must have for any fan of Chicago. If you are only into their hits - this isn't for you. If you enjoy the brass, percussion, and early Chicago sound - get this and as a bonus, you get more of the recordings than waht my dad did more than 30 years ago when he got the LP."
5,Should have.........,"Been a big Chicago fan for many years. Don't know why I didn't get this recording 40 years ago. Remastered cuts are great. Seraphine really cooks on the cuts. Heard this tour in Harrisburg, PA, Farm Show in 1971."
5,One of the greatest live recordings of all time,Chicago in their early days cranking out jazz/rock inovative music at Carnegie Hall. Terry Kath is sorely missed from the group. His influence on Chicago was essential to their early sound. If you like electric guitar buy this collection.
3,"Good, but don't use it as the only reference for the exam","The only reference I've read for the exam was this book and although I've passed the SCWCD exam I must say: it is not a complete reference.Particularly weak are the Servlet Container Model and EL sessions. It does not cover the servlet container objects life cycle (filter, listeners and servlets).The questions in the 310-081 exam are much more difficult than the questions presented in the book."
2,Good basic reference book,"Its a good basic reference book but not sufficient for the certification exam.It lacks deep in EL, The Servlet Container Model, Secure Web Applications objetives, it do not describe the initialization process for filters, listeners and servlets. The exam contains detailed question for this concepts.His authors forget include the Thread Safe servlets objetive. The web.xml example is not updated for all elements for the latest specification.Don't buy if you want only one study guide."
1,Pure crap,"Where do I begin? To put it simple, this book doesn't cover everything there is on the exam. Pay attention that in the exam there are a lot of questions about EL (Expression Language), this book just lacks the depth. On top of that it is boring and tedious as hell. Just don't buy it!"
3,"Buen libro, pero...","El libro se podría decir que es bueno, aunque le faltan algunos temas importantes del examen.Al igual que la falta de CD es un punto en su contra, trae una dirección WEB a la que se puede acceder y registrase para supuestamente recibir un usuario/clave para accesar, pero ésta nunca te llega aunque te registres 1000 veces."
4,A very good SCWCD study reference,This book not only prepares you for the exam but also can be used as a reference for your daily works.
5,Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love this juice. it tastes sooo good! And i'm excited about hearing all the good news this juice has to offer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Pretty good for the price...,"This phone is ok for a cheapy cordless phone. However, I always hear a weird echo in mine. Stays charged forever, and is very light. All in all, though, wish I had shelled out a little more and got a lot more phone."
3,OK,"Pretty good reflector. I can see how some of the feedback on the stitch on plastic reflective tape can cause an issue in lifetime. Reflectivity is top notch. length is enough to go over the ankle. I can't imagine how it can go over the cowboy boots like one of the reviews mentioned. I had wished to wear it over the motorcycle boots but it is not long enough. I took my chances with te 14"" length so it's not the product's fault. Will however be good for the ankle or lower part of the calf. Overall a very usable product and reflective part is really visible from a distance."
2,Ugh,"This is a slight remake of Transformers: Armada Sideswipe. One of the worst TFs of all time, in my opinion. Now this figure: his robot mode head is cool, it's an update of G1 Runamuck- so it satisfies the nostalgia in us older fans. The vehicle mode looks pretty darn good, and the paint job is pretty cool. However robot mode... well, robot mode stinks. His arms are terrible, and legs are merely bad. Ugly chunky car parts hanging off of skinny freaky twigs-for-limbs. Armada Sideswipe was a bad mold, and they kept repainting it into different characters. They wore me down eventually, and I got Runamuck here. I should have stuck to my guns and passed. This really isn't a very good Transformer. Trust me, skip this one and buy Ransack or something. Or, better yet, just wait 'til June when the new Transformers: Animated toys come out."
2,On Time,Ordered this for a halloween party at school. It arrived AFTER halloween even with 2 weeks to deliver.
3,Dirty Little Billy,"I was Location Manager for this movie. I think it was Stan Dragotti's first directing job for a feature film. I think he had only shot commercials prior to this. However; aside from being dreary and a little depressing, this was a fun movie, shot at Old Tucson's Mescal Western set. We had lots of water trucks keeping it muddy. It is a good western and unfortunately, they are dying out. I recommend this movie."
4,Almost perfect,"Brilliant, this was done beautifully and with the utmost care. But, rather romantically, I wish the tempo for the soprano aria had been a bit slower, and that not so much use of the non legato articulation in the tenor aria had been made."
4,Reliability and durability,"I have used Quantum batteries for the better part of my 30 year photojournalism career, and have used the Quantum Battery and +1 for over 10 years. These batteries are VERY reliable, and durable, and give me evenly delivered performance each time I use them. They are made with a rugged simplicity, and their modular connections make it easy for me to change flash hardware and simply get a different adaptor cable to fit it to my battery.I wish the cells lasted longer than 1.5 years, but then again, mine get a LOT of work. I am about to have my older set refurbed by Dasaga PhotoGraphic in Oklahome City, and look forward to Sam adding another year or so to my older battery kits.Quantum Battery +1 is on TOP of my pro photo flash hardware list!"
5,So cute and funny! So adventurous!,"I loved this book! I had to read it and re-read it and re-read it, especially certain memorable passages. I kept wishing I could be Vicky Bliss in the arms of that beautiful Smythe man. Was he cocky, arrogant, and charming and sophisticated and fast talking and handsome or what? I loved the extremities of her charactes, because they turn out to be so entertaining. I read Trojan Gold after reading her very first Vicky Bliss mystery. I thought Trojan Gold was the second book in the series. And then later on I found out that there was a book in between, and read the second bliss mystery, and did not like it very much. The third one is the best Bliss mystery, I think, next to the first one. The forth one is okay, but nothing like the first and third. Those are hilarious."
5,The Vicky Bliss mysteries are superb!!,"Eliabeth Peters' Vicky Bliss novels, in this reader's opinion, are the best of her book series. If you haven't read them, I strongly urge you to do so but make sure you do so in chronological order."
3,not yet,"This book is next on my list. Had to catch with the series,so far I have really enjoyed the ones I have read."
5,Hilarious,"I've just reread this book for about the 8th time and *still* I laughed aloud--when I could catch my breath from the fast pacing. Loved it, loved it, loved it. Now that Ms. Peters has finally gotten Ramses and Nefret together in her Amelia Peabody series, maybe she will return to Vicky Bliss. I'm hoping."
4,The Fourth Installment of the Vicky Bliss series,"The third book in the Vicky Bliss series, this book unites Vicky and John with her old flame, Tony, and her boss, Schmidt, in the search for the lost gold of Troy.This novel is excellent- it brings back the character of Tony from the first Vicky novel, and adds to the mix other historians. The suspense is great, and the relationship between Vicky and John reaches a new level.This is an awesome book!"
1,It's too bad,that Medicine Story Manitonquat Francis Talbot had to go and change perfectly wonderful creation stories to make his book more marketable. This book is published for children and it is reinforcing the stereotypes the dominant culture has of Indian Peoples.
4,Earl of Kerrick a Traitor of his Country,"`Mightier than the Sword' by Peggy Waide has written a fun historical romance/mystery novel. Rebecca is a strong-willed woman who has loved Adam since he made her dollhouse for Christmas when she was seven years old. Before Adam left for war, he broke Rebecca's heart. He is back from War and being investigated for treason and has to turn to Rebecca for help and trust her with life and his heart. I would recommend this book and if you enjoy this genre, I would also suggest `A Loving Scoundrel' by Johanna Lindsey ,`When We Meet' by Victoria Alexander and 'All about love' by Stephanie Laurens."
1,run while you still can,"This book had nothing to recommend it. The characters were awful, the writing was awful, the plot was awful, the dialogue was awful, the [adult] scenes were boring. Do not read this book. You will probably regret it.I would discuss the plot, but there really isn't much of one. And more irritatingly, nothing is resolved in the book. Ms. Waide brings up all sorts if issues, but they all sort of magically drift away when the hero and heroine fall in love. The book goes nowhere. This book is not worth any amount of money paid for it."
2,"2.5, but I just can't give it a 3","The crippled fighting is amazing, but there were not enough fights in this movie!!!!!! They had plenty of training but I need freaking fighting. The storyline is horrible and doesn't really come up with anythign enw except for usign real cripples. But then again, I heard that there is a sequel for this movie and I will definitely check it out if I can. THE CRIPPLED MASTERS ARE GOOD, THEIR MOVIE IS NOT."
3,The lack of limbs can't stop these kungfu masters,The Crippled Masters will give you the same sick feeling you get at an open casket funeral.Two emenys are forced to team up agianst the Chineese crime lord who has done away with ones arms and the others legs.With the help of a matrial arts master the duo become a fighting force.The fact that both the leads have been born with birth defects in real life ranks Cripple Masters as one sick little puppy of a film.You will not belive the action as the two get down to some kungfu butt kicking.Amust for anyone who loves true trash. A long time fave of cult dircetor John Waters
1,Backing up Arnie's opinion,"I bought it simply because it has crippled people fighting. It's funny for a couple of minutes.....then you realize how bad it stinks. If given the option to redo my purchase I would still make it. Not that I'm so insensitive, but it was funny watching these crippled guys fight.I now feel like a terrible person."
5,Heartfelt account of sheer triumph over so called disability.,"This is a movie with real disabled people, just two of them. Though the title may suggest a gimmicky poke fun of, mockery novelty type laugh at ""crippled"" people sort of movie. It's just the opposite of the that, more on that later. It starts out with action, they chop the arm off of a good guy, well, a guy that we don't know. A while later they chop his other arm off and throw him off down stairs in one of the *SPOILER ALERT* four scenes in which the armless man spins around and around. This is where you think it gets interesting, but no, the viewer must work for that. There are handfulls of wonderful moments in the film. The one armless hero and the one legless hero are good friends. They find another good friend that hides in wooden baskets."
4,conatins some hard to find versions,"This was the only place I could find this particular version of She Came In Through The Bathroom Window. Anybody know when/where this performance was? I also have the versions from Mad Dogs and Woodstock, of course, but this version has a special place in my heart becuause it's the one I heard on the radio growing up. Same with With A Little Help From My Friends. And this was the ONLY place I could find High Time We Went. What a gem, forgot how tastey that one was!"
3,A bit disappointed,"First off, let me say that before this came in we purchased a used Lovesac, which is incredible. That being said, I believe that you get what you pay for. This chair is made with foam beads, so I suspect we will have to refill at some point (which is a mess). It is very light. You have to reshape it into lips with each use. The cover is not washable. The size is appropriate and my 11 y/o daughter LOVES it. So, it was worth purchasing but you pay for the gimmick."
5,Color is a little different,I love this chair. I got it for my 5 year daughter for Christmas. The only thing I dont like about it is the color is a pinkish purple. I thought it was a lite pink. It is REALLY big.
3,"Good, but not perfect","Mmmmmmmh... a good album, of course. But not what i expected. I enjoyed THE FIFTH COLUMN, but with this one... maybe i've not listened this one enough time but... when i got any of their previous albums, i loved them at the first time i listened them. But i have listened this one more than 10 times and can't remember any song. And this didn't happened to me before with any acumen album"
1,Wrong merchandise shipped :(,"Received wrong merchandise. Original order was for Magellan 980827, a 12/24 volt power adapter. Item received was a Belkin 'Y' Audio cable. Not even close !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Didn't help,"Well, looks like GPS stop working, but the size is a little small. It is loosing a bit. wasn't able to test it."
4,Magellan Replacement Chord,"The product works properly without a problem. The original equipment had a spiral chord, this item does not."
5,Beautiful Bracelet,"The bracelet was just as pictured, the price was very good, it arrived promptly and was well packaged. I will do business with this seller again."
2,I was disappointed.,"Since Fendi is hard to find and has an outrageous price if you do, I got this thinking I would like it and it might be reminiscent of the original Fendi. Just too heavy for young up to middle aged women."
5,Scaveture Kids Is A Hit,"What a great rainy day or cottage game. We took it on holiday with us and every kid in the campground was playing. What a hit! They became more and more creative with each game they played. Thanks for such a great game....maybe I'll get the adult version, who knows we may have even more fun than the kids!"
1,Very poor quality,As it stands now I have been sent 2 different units from the seller and have been told to deal directly with the manufacturer directly at my own expense to try to get a functioning unit. I would spend the extra money to get a good one rather than deal with this hassle.
5,The best replacement razor heads for the best razor.,"I have had the original Sensor for almost 12 years now, and it still works the best of the ones i have tried. The Sensor 3 blades nick me up more, the Mach 3 again tends to nick me up more as well, and any of the store brand replacement heads for this Sensor just do not work out as well as the original sensor/sensor XL heads. The two blades seem to give me the closest shave without irritation, and after 12 years that alot of shaving. Don't waste money on more expensive newer models, if you have this one or can get this one, blades are cheaper and it does better, Gillette sensor blades last longer."
3,"Not bad, but I prefer the original Sensor","Hi... I've used both the Sensor and the Sensor Excel cartridges. These Excel cartridges are supposed to be better because of the rubber strip in front of the blades, which supposedly smoothes the skin to prepare it for the blades. Well, in my experience it just creates more drag. The original Sensor glides over the skin more smoothly, so I would recommend going with it instead of the Sensor Excel."
2,not as ood as I thought,"This was suppouse to be a documentary, but you only get like a few commentaries from Austin and then pure old wrestling matches, not that I don't like Austin wrestling matches, but I was expecting more historic facts."
3,Wrestler?,"I got this DVD collection because I was like everybody else, I loved Steve's attitude and everytime you heard his music you knew someone was gonna get a butt-kicking. After watching I realized something; he was a limited wrestler. There wasn't a lot of excitement and some matches I fast forwarded. If you are a fan of Stone Cold, then by all means purchase this. You might not be mad, but I doubt it. How many times can you watch a headlock, slam, forearm thrust, backdrop and then a stunner? That's all you got after wrestling for a decade or more?"
5,The complete Stone Cold Collection,"I am a huge stone cold fan, and even thought I have all his previous tapes and dvds, it's fine with me to have everything in one set including probably thing I don't have. This set was supposed to be out last august but they held it back to remove any and all refences to Chris Benoit, any matches or comments made by Benoit were deleted here, keep that in mind when you watch the dvds."
3,Disappointed,"First I would like to say, being a die hard Stone Cold fan, I could not wait to get my hands on this DVD. I can't say thre DVD isn't good, but I was very disappointed. I can not believe the little attention that was given towards the Austin vs. Mcmahon feud. Three matches that I though with no question, would be on this set. Austin vs.Mcmahon, Austin vs. Brett Hart, submission match and the first blood match Austin vs Undertaker. How could this DVD set not have at least one of these three matches on it. Should have at least Austin vs. Mcmahon match. DVD is ok, but disappointing."
2,Ehhh,"I should have kept my money, because I was not thrilled with the way that the DVD was put together, and the things in the DVD. If you make a Stone Cold Legacy DVD, why would you stop in the video in early 2001. He wrestled until 2003, and had a very interesting storyline called THE INVASION that regenerated his career. WWE is screwing up all over."
3,Could have been better.,"WWE: The Legacy of Stone Cold Steve AustinA good DVD that could have been better. They skipped over so many great moments its sickening. The DVD ends after Rock/ Austin at Wrestlemania 17, two years before his career ended at Wrestlemania 19. Its a good pick up dont get me wrong, but if you want an in depth look pick up the other Stone Cold DVDs from the past as well."
2,only rent this DVD,"I thought this DVD would be great since it talks about a great superstar. The extras are good. But throughout i think almost all of this dvd, there is background music when they are talking about steve austin or when steve austin is driving his truck, they are talking about him, but there is that stupid background music. i dont need to hear that. that made the whole DVD very stupid. i rented this dvd, but could only watch half of it.Eric E. (Superior, Wisconsin)"
4,Stone Cold's Legacy,"Although the Stone Cold Era is over, his legacy lives on. I watched every single match on this DVD from the start of his career.Although the DVD case was well presented, I received the case broken and I could not use the case any more."
5,Yet Another Soon to be GREAT Release!!!,According to some sources this DVD set is said to be similar to that of the Bret Hart DVD which if you bought it was one disc with almost a 2 hr documentary and a few matches. Then on discs 2 and 3 they have bout 10 matches on each!Should be a GREAT DVD!!!!
3,No King of the Ring?,"I am a die-hard wrestling fan and big fan of Stone Cold......I have read his book two times, which, by the way, is my favorite wrestling autobiography. If you haven't read it, get a copy asap. But my main reason for writing this is, if what I see here is the case, the King of the Ring where Austin 3:16 was created is not even on this disc. I know the date was June 23, 1996. That's when Stone Cold won a match at KOR, got stitches, and came back and beat Jake the Snake Roberts and cut the famous promo where he said ""Austin 3:16 says I just kicked your a**!"" If that is not on this disc, and I'm talking each match from the event and the whole promo, then this disc gets 2 stars off right away."" That was one of the most important nights in wrestling, up there when Hogan beat the Sheik for the belt in 1984."
3,if you wanted to see more gimme a hell ya!!,"A 3 star release from the wwe on possibly the greatest superstar in the companies history. While the match selection was good it could have been better, and considering that the rattlesnake was one of the best mic workers ever some of his classic promos and raw moments should have been inserted as extras. I hope the upcoming Rock set will be better done."
4,must have for stone cold fans!,well presented documentary from his humble beginnings up to the redneck triathlon. not much extras but entire dvd is jam packed. blurring of wwf logo kinda annoys me while watching the dvd. it's a must have for any wrestling dvd collection and stone cold fans.
5,A great dvd and a great superstar of the WWE and thats the bottom line cause stone cold says so,"The dvd has got alot of great matches in stone cold steve austins career, showing how he broke his neck against the late great owen hart. Who could forget that great Wrestlemania moment between Austin and The Rock, two of the greatest superstars ever to entered WWE. Stone Cold is possibly the best crowd pleaser, hell raiser and toughest S.O.B the world will ever see and thats the bottom line cause Stone Cold says so."
3,Can't believe I bought these,"Go to your local sports store. They have offical baseballs there for much cheeper. In fact I'm sure the price was raised on these since that last time I bought them (2 years ago). Oh and ""6 D-OB"" doesn't mean 6 dozen. (I'm a noob at baseball) it means 6 Dimond Offical Baseballs. However I am good at math at around $30 for the bag / 6 balls thats roughly $5 a ball & thats a hefty cost. You can almost get dozzen for the price of 1 ball."
1,BAD! BAD! BAD!!!,I recived a very thin design cd -as I took it out of container it cracked all over-very thin cd- I have written seller twice and no answer-Poor ethic !!!!
4,decent book for a beginner,"good luck. you need time, money and determination as well as personal physical and mental health.But you need the information in this book also. But determniation and patience are key. And the abilityto either do rehab work or be a DIY handy person yourself or with family members. again. Good luck."
4,"This is everything a new investor needs to get started, A-","All the relevant material you could ask for as a investor just starting out. I used it to purchase my first home. I paid $120 out of pocket to acquire a $110,000 townhome in Baltimore, MD for $88,000. The concepts taught and comparisons made between real estate investing and other options(stocks, etc.) are very informative."
5,"Great Book, Great Author","This book offers a down-to-earth, practical approach to building wealth in real estate. It is NOT a get-rich-quick book. It is for the conservative investors who are willing to take the time to build their wealth slowly but with minimum risk. I have read numberous books on investing in real estate, this one simply tops them all.Also, the author, Gary Eldred, is very genuine in helping people get started. After reading this book, I had some questions and decided to call Gary. He patiently answered my questions and gave me a lot of good advice.Gary, I would like to take this chance to openly thank you for your help. And congratulations on writing a great book!"
5,"Best Book on Subject, PERIOD","This book is the best book on the subject of real estate investing. I encourage anyone with an intrest in real estate investing to pick this book up. This book is in its fifth edition because the information within every edition is simply the best, most well-written, complete, and up-to-date information in text ever. It helps also, to note that the authors have Phd's from prestigious universities. They teach at some of the most elite learning institutions around, write editorials and articles for newspapers and magazines (including the Wall Strreet Journal), and also work with Donald Trump himself. I think success like that speaks for itself-how many real estate ""gurus"" can say that?? Not many!! This book will definitely not disappoint and can by itself, lead you on a path to great success AND wealth in the world of real estate investing."
5,Cuts through the hype,"This is one of the few books on real estate investing that avoids the ""hype"". Instead, it's just a good solid book that clearly explains how to spot opportunities while at the same time pointing out how to step around pitfalls. The best chapter on valuing properties of any of the many books that I've read."
5,The why and how of investing,"By far, the most intelligent guide to real estate investing that I have seen.Want proof? Read the ""free"" pages here on Amazon. That's what enticed me. Then, just as I was anticipating, the rest of the book delivers as promised. A great guide for the investor who really wants to learn the ins and outs of real estate."
5,Investor's Handbook,"The authors should have titled this book, the Investor's Handbook. Name any topic--seller financing, foreclosures, property management, saving on property and income taxes, creating value with fix-up and renovation.....I could go on...but you get the point. I found this book to be a greatly informative intro to real estate investing book. The authors give many personal examples, but always caution to tailor a strategy to the market conditions in the local market--unlike many books that try to convince you of the one true way."
5,Informative Book,"If you want to learn....read this book. If you want to dream....read ""Real Estate Riches""."
2,Reads like a Book Report,See this book....see that book...see my other book....I felt like I was back in school and doing research. This book had a lot of good tips but it was a pity that I already knew them from a great website called Creative Real Estate Online. Bought this book in conjunction with The Unofficial Guide to Real Estate and I read that one first. Maybe THAT'S why this book seemed dry and boring in comparison. Can't understand why this book got such high reviews. I recommend the earlier mentioned book and website.
3,"Great for Rent-Investing, Not So Much for Fix-Flip","Overall, if you are interested in investing in real estate to rent to tenants, this is the book for you. This book is very complete when discussing financing, maximizing return on investment, various ways to obtain bargain prices, negotiating contracts, etc., but overall, this book was not what I was looking for.This book was written for people mainly wanting to purchase multiple unit apartment buildings and the various ways an investor can capitalize on their investment. I was looking for a book about fixing and flipping real estate, but this book only has one chapter on the subject. He has written a book specifically on the topic, so pick up his Make Money with Fixer-Uppers and Renovations, which I haven't read yet, so I don't know how good it is."
5,Real Estate Investing,"Although, I don't agree with everything the author says, this is a very good book on how to start investing in real estate. He gives an objective look at investing by pointing out some of the difficulties and not just concentrating on the get rich quick type attitude of many of these books. I would definately recommend this book as a must read."
2,Irwin Circular Saw Blades,My experienced tool users said that these blades were dull after a few cuts. They made me promise not to buy them again. Good price; not worth it.
1,Really disappointed,"I'm really disappointed in this set. Whoever mastered it should be fired. Songs are abruptly cut off (Rock Master Scott & The Dynamic 3 - Request Line), they start late.. its a mastering fiasco. The song selection is great but crappy mastering ruined what would be a great collection. For what it cost, I expected it to be perfect."
3,Track Listing - #Fail,"I am a Huge Rap fan when it comes to rap music of the 80s. But this collection struck a nerve with me just from the track listing alone - (Nothing Serious) Just Buggin' - Afro-rican ??? Seriously? The group who did that song is called WHISTLE. Not Afro-Rican, in fact, Many of the artists are mixed up with the song titles. Come on people, get it together. Thank God I already own all these songs. I wouldnt waste money on this poorly put together set"
5,Good plug.,"Good plug, i bought it to replace my lawn mowers fouled plug, i haven't had issues with my lawn mower since."
4,EXPLOITATION EXPLOSION VO. E,"The clips of previews are just GREAT. Some are a bit graphic and almost too graphic, A must have."
4,Liked it,"I enjoyed this book but found that it did not neccesarily apply to my job as a soial worker. I work towards finding permanency for abused and neglected children and while the book is very thorough about the systems used in the various states, my state doesn't work like this, so it was disconcerting at times. Overall, teh way the children interact with adults is very true and the problems facing our kids are the same."
3,Repurpose Proposal,"Here in Arkansas we have a major problem with the foster care program. It's not the program that is the problem, its not having enough foster parents to be able to take care of these children. There are over 3,000 children in the foster care program and if we don't do something about it soon these kids could end up in gangs or drugs when they are released from the program after they turn eighteen. I am proposing that we get the program that is called the C.A.L.L to go and get every church in Arkansas to be involved in the foster care program, because if just one family in each church helps then we could have enough homes for these kids to live in, and the main goal here is to get every child adopted in Arkansas. I think if this happens then these kids will have a better chance making a difference here in America, and they will also have a better chance of not getting involved in Gangs or Drugs."
4,Rich Girl Down With The Poor Folks,"This book is a sobering study of the children that many Americans write-off as lost causes. Toth is realistic about these kids' likelihood of making it, but her very human portrayal of them leaves room for hope, and she provides dignity to her subjects even when they are at their worst. I would have liked a little more analysis of the systemic issues of race and class that determined much of the kids' lives before they were even born. At times Toth's tone stinks of noblesse oblige, and somehow her status of white/liberal/middle-class/college girl shines through in every word without ever actually being addressed. Nevertheless, I am always pleased when someone gives the underrepresented a voice, and Toth does just that."
5,Tug At Your Heart,This is a wonderful book. Heart wrenching but the truth as it is. she bring life to something people would rather ignore. Children who were swept under a rug are given a voice by Jennifer Thoth. I love this book.
2,Not for non-sailors,"Like the other reviewers, I downloaded this book because it was free. I would have enjoyed the book more if I were more familiar with nautical terms, which I thought the Kindle dictionary did a very poor job on, and if the author had not gone into such boring detail in using these terms. If you are not familiar with sailing and the terminology of it, you will find this a frustrating read."
3,pretty good ghost story,"a ghost story of the classical style. strange things starts happening on a ship. is it haunted? are there ghost pirates trying to take over? it is well written. well worked. but somehow, the real horror escapes."
3,Tough read with underlying strengths,"Its been a tough read. The plot was strong and the characters decently developed. However, the over-encompassing use of 'pirate' dialogue and period appropriate speak makes it a difficult read as you spend more time trying to sound out and figure out what was sai than actually enjoy the story."
4,"Pretty Good, But Be Warned....","This was a very gripping novel about pirate ghosts. It got me hooked right from the beginning. There is a few things that you should know going into it. There are a lot of nautical terms in this book that the author does not explain. I have no nautical experience so some of these things were confusing, but I eventually figured it out, so it was not a huge, book ruining problem. Another thing is that when he uses dialogue, he makes it so some of the characters have extremely broken English. Some of the sentences that they were using were a little confusing. For example the word ""who"" turns into ""oo"". These things were also not a huge, book ruining problem, but be warned that you may have to read a few of the sentences a few times to figure out all of what he is saying through context. Other than that it was a good book, and I would recommend it!"
5,Mysterious Ways,"Harold Budd and Robun Guthrie created magic with the score to the film Mysterious Skin. Listened on its own, this soundtrack is the perfect complement to the chilling film. Each track stunning on its own works seamlessly into one another to form a gorgeous collage of emotionally-charged instrumentals that amazingly reflects the mood of the poignant film then re-creates every scene in your mind. At times, the songs leave you feeling chilly and distant like the way it felt in the film.One of the best scores of the year!"
5,This is a film score of Oscar caliber,"To be quite honest, I never heard of this film or its score until about a month ago.The two reasons I sought it out: Robin Guthrie and Harold Budd.I was not surprised at the the beautiful work these two have created here and though it is different than their other colaborations the quality of the work never changes, they are the best at what they do.If you like what you hear on this score then I very much recommend Guthrie's and Budd's other works as well. You will find that your adventure that began with the music youve heard here will continue to take you down many other paths in their other works!This disc will remain in my collection permanently."
5,Mysterious Skin Soundtrack CD,"This is an outstanding ambient collaboration between Harold Budd and Robin Guthrie. Both artists contribute their heavily effected, down-tempo, atmospheric instrumentals to produce restrained but compelling textures. I don't usually buy CDs anymore, but in this case I wanted to go high res. Although this is a soundtrack, this album easily stands on it's own."
4,Mysterious Skin - Great Music,The etheral sounds on this cd are as haunting as the film. I highly recommend this cd.

Performing thousands of shows, appearing on local and national television, receiving radio airplay, producing eight CDs and a DVD has made Big Engine one of the most well known and popular rock bands in the southeast United States.

1,A perversion of the meaning of Passover,This is one of the most twisted concepts I have ever seen relating to Jewish Holidays. Passover is a celebration of the miraculous escape from bondage by the Jewish people. By combining that meaning with the authors views of social problems is to blaspheme the word of G-d. This book does not deserve to be called an Hagaddah.
2,Not worth the money!!,"I have been using this product for several weeks now, and I dont see one bit of difference in the appearance of my skin. Flaws are still visible and when I put my liquid to powder foundation on top of it, all my dry skin flakes up terribly. My very cheap moisturizers work just as well, if not better. Only good thing is that it is lightweight and has a nice scent."
5,POWERFUL AND FULL OF KNOWLEDGE,"I can't put it down. This book of Knowledge is very intriguing and worth the buy. If you are religious and want more insight into the hidden mysteries, A PERFECT BUY AND WORTH EVERY PENNY SPENT AND MORE!!!"
5,"Best ""Book of Creation"" Available","This is the most impressive ""Book of Creation"" that I have come across so far. I was ""introduced"" to this book through references of other books. The numerous references made me wonder whether this book is good.Hence I got this book and indeed,.. the author is very knowledgable and complete in his approach. It is the best that I have come across.If you want to get ""Book of Creation"" in English, this one is not to be missed."
5,Time to make a golem (?),"The commentary, descriptions, references, and diagrams used by Aryeh Kaplan make this cryptic work as accessible as it could possibly be in English.A must have for serious English speaking Torah students, curious and do not have access to their own personal Kabbalistic minded rabbi/scholar."
2,A list of boxers,"this book tells of 11 current boxers starting with mike tyson and ending with Oscar De La Hoya. The articles are good but in some parts of the articles the facts get confusing. The real problem is in the appendix, it shows fight files, records, but there are many mistakes and many cut offs, they dont finish something after they start it, the facts in the book are not exactly the same as the appendix's. So overall this book is not good at all and a discrase to something called EDITING!"
3,Couldn't captivate me,"Some months ago I started watching a bunch of releases in the ongoing library of foreign and indie movie releases from Film Movement, and this is another one I picked up just the other day.""Hawaii, Oslo"" (124 min.; originally released in Norway 2004) brings an ensemble of characters and story lines that are interwoven throughout the movie, although the common ground is a character in a psychiatric hospital. For whatver reason, the movie could not grab my attention and captivate me. I was watching but felt removed from it, and never emotionally invested in the characters or the overall story.Of all the Film Movement releases that I have seen, ""Hawaii, Oslo"" has been the least interesting to date, from my perspective. And I do realize that these perceptions are quite subjective. This is not a bad movie obviously, but it didn't do it for me, unfortunately."
4,CAPTIVATING!,"LOVED THE MOVIE from the first musical intro over credits. excellent writing the way the characters are all tied together. Kalaidascope effect was beautifully done, definitely worth watching, with a touch of mysticism."
3,Bob Marley & The Wailers Boston 1980,"Bob Marley & The Wailers Boston 1980 [Absord (Japan) ABCP-93]Low-quality bootleg.12 tracks. 60:03. Tracks:01 - Slave Driver02 - Burnin' And Lootin'03 - Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)04 - The Heathen05 - Rebel Music06 - I Shot The Sheriff07 - Easy Skanking08 - No Woman, No Cry09 - Lively Up Yourself.10 - War11 - Get Up, Stand Up12 - Exodus[DW]"
2,Bob Marley : Live,"I am from Boston so I could not wait to get my hands on this, but I was very disapointed with the quality. Since I'm a serious Bob Marley fan, I will keep it for my collections, but that is it. It is only good for collections of Bob Marley's materials... I and I say peace out"
4,Entertaining Book For Fans,"If you are a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you will enjoy this book (and the other Watcher guides). Not only is this a reference book, but one with ""attitude"" - it has an irreverent wit to it, that I found appealing."
4,"So close, but...","Great content, but the layout of the book is jumbled and confusing. (Repeat after me: Form FOLLOWS function!) It also begs for an index, especially since the Table of Contents is so minimal as to be worthless."
4,Right along with the stake and holy water...,"An excellent companion to the hit WB television show. The book has got everything from minor flaws in the storyline and Buffy environment, to biographies on all of the characters, and even a guide to the bands and music heard on the show."
5,A great book!!!!!!,"This is a must-have for Buffy fans. I watch Buffy every Tuesday and it's the best show. This book has everthing. it has pictures, interviews, and lots of information."
5,This was an excellent book,"The watcher's guide is a total perfect guide for any die hard fans that yearn for buffy information.If you love buffy and want to know more about it this is the book for you.It's got everything and facts that you never knew about buffy,episodes synopsis up to the third season,behind the scenes look at sunnydale high and the characters,stunt double,pictures that are remarkeable and a jam packed book that huge and reliable,it's awesome with information you can't find anywhere ele,it's a must buy for a buffy die hard fan!~Linda davt"
4,Pretty interesting though a bit lightweight,"I like the books by Kenneth Topping a lot more than the official guides. They are more fun, more informative, and because they aren't ""official"" can be fans more than authors maintaining an official relationship with the show. But having said that, this and its companion volume are both really informative. And although I knew all the quotes anyway, it was a lot of fun reading them all. The best part of the book is the interviews with people you normally don't hear as much about, like set designers and associate producers and such."
4,"a few flaws, but a good guide.","a good book for buffy fans. it tends to repeat itself a lot, redundantly, over and over. see it's annoying. but basically the quotes are fun and you learn interesting things. especially if you are like me and became a fan late first season so missed alot of background. it is also reasonably priced for what you get. highly recomended"
5,This book is soooooooo good!,"The show is excellent, but this book (and all those other novelizations, like CHILD OF THE HUNT and BLOODED) are also REALLY good. I've read a LOT of books and these novelizations/companion are on my favorites list. It tells you EVERYTHING. I just got it yesterday and although it's expensive, boy was it worth it!!! This book is really thick (not to mention BIG). I can't wait to finish reading it!!!! Q.L."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This book, while an interesting read, does not provide anything new for loyal fans. It is mostly descriptions of characters and a synopsis of each episode. While it does provide some interesting tidbits, like major developments in episodes that will be important later and a description of some of the music, it is not worth the money, especially for those who have kept up with the show."
3,Lots happening here,"This episode of the Doctor has quite a bit going on with two significant foes to be dispatched. First there is the political intrigue, a brother who is trying to steal his sibling's rule by killing said sibling and his son. Then there is the evil intelligence (the Mandragora) the Doctor has unwittingly brought with him. Its goal is (of course) to rule the universe.The Doctor is aided by Sarah in this one, which takes place in Italy in 1492. No mention of Columbus though :) I found the political plot to be a bit distracting at times, it seemed more time was spent on it than the Mandragora. Personally I would have prefered more emphasis on the Mandragora.All in all an OK book, and a quick read."
1,Poor directions=A poor experience,"We were very excited about this game and were very disappointed when 4 college educated adults could hardly make sense out of the directions ...we decided to procede even though we were confused by the directions and after 10 minutes totally gave up because the purpose was so unclear...how could this be a game for ages 8 and up if adults couldn't even ""get it""?"
4,"Happy Mom in Dallas, Tx","I love conscience and play it often with my 12 year old son. The game gets the conversation started on those tough topics, which is exactly what I had hoped it would do! While the rules were a little confusing, we did find clearer instructions on the company's website ..... My son now finds it easier to talk with me about issues he faces with friends and at school. It helps me to see how he sees things and lets me guide him in choices he may face in the future. It has been a great way to examine those tough topics necessary to discuss with children and in a fun format. I highly recommend the game!"
4,Hilton on pole with this driver's biography!,"This book gave me all the statistics that I needed about this wonderful and versatile driver. Hilton has an amazing ability to recognise talent before it happens and he certainly has done so here. The author has managed to find some unpublished photos of this driver and it is enjoyable not to see the same old pictures that everyone else uses!I enjoyed the historical aspects and HHF's rise to glory, however I would have liked more 'in depth' dialogue with the racer himself: His thoughts on winning his first race, his thoughts on his team-mate's horrific accident at Monaco in 1994 and his stormy year with Williams. Perhaps as Frentzen's star rises Hilton will write a sequel and once more we will enjoy his easy, sometimes witty, thoroughly factual style."
2,Very boring,"Mr. Hilton should stop to write cheap bigraphies about any racing drivers and focus only in real sucessful drivers, like he did with Ayrton Senna and Jacques Villeneuve. "" Fast track to Glory""? Where? Of course anyone who arrives in F-1 is a very gifted driver, but reading about Frentzen's career adds nothing to an auto-racing fan."
2,FAST TRACK TO WHERE ??,"I don't know what the tittle of this book means, but Frentzen is a good pilot. What I don't think is that he's destined with a ""fast track to glory""... He's just an average driver, like the rest of them all in F-1 nowadays, ( with the exception of Schumacher ). Hilton always writes this kind of book about drivers ( any drivers !!!! ), maybe for love of sport, maybe for the money ..."
5,Perfect Little Scraper,"Great little scraper - don't let the size fool you! Perfect for getting dripped paint from windows and counter tops, removing old glue from surfaces, etc. We even use just for opening large packages."
5,Sharp little gadget,"This item was bought to remove a park district sticker that had been on my car's windshield for 4 years. My first attempt was to manually remove the sticker but that ended up just peeling off the corners. Second attempt was to use WD-40 but that didn't help. I probably spent 15-20 minutes with the less than effective procedures aforementioned. With this little gadget, the process took 20 seconds tops. Definitely worth the couple of dollars and I would strongly recommended this product for safely handling safety razor blades and sticker removals."
2,Razor Scraper,"The durability is gone from this scraper, I and three friends have used this in the past for small tight areas and was great (many yrs). The plastic notch in the middle that holds the blade doesn't for long, sliding sideways creating a hazard we all agree. The shape and color are still the same, perfect.Stanley might fix the problem, but people will use it because the other scrapers in use are not better. Price is not the factor value is.Searching for a replacement, no luck yet."
4,I like it,I mean there isn't too much to say about this product it's small and nice i used it to remove some adhesive and it worked like a charm (:
4,Mini Razor,"Good for scraping hard to get spots, like removing a registration/insurance stickers from windshields. Easy to use, very sharp. Quick delivery."
4,Pretty Good,"The price on this razor is really good. The downsides are that the plastic feels just a little bit like it might break if I put too much pressure on it, but it's probably not that likely. Another issue is that the blade feels very loose when it's turned around in storage mode. I could also see it being easy to hit the ""open"" button and have the razor fly across the room. Overall, these issue are not likely to be a big deal, and the razor works very well. I would purchase this product again."
5,Fly tieing,This is a great book for learning what to look for when you are trying to find which fly to use.
3,Still awaiting the ultimate Ian Hunter collection,"At first, I was very excited when I found out about this release. A compilation of Ian Hunter's prime work, during both his Mott the Hoople days and first few albums of his solo career sounded perfect. Alas, the track listing left me a bit puzzled when it came to his solo work. In my judgment, it was still just 3 or 4 solo songs shy of what I would consider an ultimate collection. Then when I saw the price of over $47, I realized you can get just as much, or even more, for less $$.My suggestion: Get a hold of a copy of the first Mott compilation, ""The Ballad of Mott the Hoople"" released over a decade ago but available used. Then add just one or maybe two of Hunter's solo albums from the 70's(I am partial to ""You're Never Alone with a schizophrenic"") and you will end up with enough to appreciate Ian Hunter's contribution to rock plus save a few bucks in the process."
4,good,to summarize this is a powerful and good product... but the software WINTV is not that good i used progdvb which better works with it.
4,Very nice card for the money,"There are a plethora of dvb cards on the market and i had a hard time choosing one. But after some research i hit the money with this one. Crisp video, the tuner is very strong as well. Video capture from camcorder is good quality, very little if any frame dropping.I use this in my HTPC running mediaportal and sometimes dvbdream. Very nice card."
3,Mis-labelled product,"Caution, I had to return this product because the required software disc could not be read. Also, the product seems to have been mis-labelled as something the allows the user to watch and record over the air TV channels, which it is not. It's specifically for free to air MPEG2 satellite viewing. Once I got the replacement product, however it works fine."
4,Caroline Lavelle - unsung star?,I have reviewed her album Spirit and the same comments apply here. She has a wonderful voice and is a classically trained cellist. Her voice is a mix of Mary Hopkin and Joan Baez with that plaintiff and folksy quality that is both soothing and engaging. Well worth a listen if you like eclectic music with a folksy/modern overtone. I first heard her on an album called The Dawnseeker by Sleepthief in a track called Nightjar. Well worth a listen as an introduction to Caroline Lavelle. Generally well produced and professional. Look for her presentation on [...]. This CD is expensive as it is an import but it is well worth it in my opinion.
4,Our solutions intensify the problems they intended to solve,"Today I took this book for the first time in twenty six years from my shelf. A feeling such as greeting an old friend welled in my heart. The message was ever here with me.Please let me indulge you with one short quotation:""For the first time in history most of our problems deteriorate the moment we try to solve them. Our solutions intensify the problems they were intended to solve or create new and more serious problems..."" (p.11)"
2,Not in Spanish,"Although this coloring book is titled Spanish Edition it is in English. The pictures are very beautiful, but it has a Hindu theme. Not exactly what I was looking for when I purchased it."
5,ANOTHER GREAT ITEM,I once had this on tape so i had to get it again since it was recorded as as ADD it sounded better.Not only that it was a great bargain also to have.Not all albums sound like this at all-some albums sound distorted.This worth hearing and the price.
4,TR Variations - Deface the (Todd Rundgren) Music,"These artists have each attempted to capture a facet of the sonic or lyrical essence of Todd Rundgren.It is an entertaining romp through Mr. Rundgren's catalogue - and I'll be damned, if there aren't some jewels on here that stand on their own!"
4,Great read,Really enjoyed book. Read it while sitting on a tree stand sit and gives you lots to thi k about.
5,Great Product,"I have badly cracked heels and put lotion on my feet at night, but it does get everywhere and I cannot stand to sleep with socks on. I found these at the local drug store and thought for 5 bucks I'd try them. They stay on all night and in the morning I get up wash the pads and hang them to dry By the time I am ready for bed they are dry. These things are so siple but worth every penny!"
3,Sound Quality Fair,"For the price we paid for this product, the sound quality is fair for such small speakers, though I am only using it at my desk at work and I can't have loud volume anyway. Even when using the speakers and everything's plugged in, you still end up going through a lot of batteries for the CD player itself, or you have to use long-lasting lithium batteries because the CD player only holds one AA battery. Mostly this product is just fine."
3,you only get one,"I bought this after reading the reviews. But you only get one! The ad comes across as multiples but only one was sent so now I have to return it not cool. Overall container looks good, but I'm not willing to pay 25 bucks for one container, and they aren't willing to send me the remained."
3,Perfect for moving,Bought this to start packing to move into my first home. It's perfect and I can see everything in it.
5,B-movie goodness,"Obviously most people who wrote their reviews don't have the same sense, appreciation or eye as I do. I'm not going to tell you this movie is full of great acting, plot, or cinematography. It's not. But all of those traditional things that are lacking in the face of typical hollywood films, is a great campy, cheesy, b-horror movie about vampires. You have to have a certain sense of humor to enjoy these types of films. This is what I call a good ""bad"" movie. People take things so seriously, and can't stop for a second to realize that these low budget movies are satirical, tongue in cheek and probably MEANT to be chock full of camp and cheese. And if the director wanted the movie to be serious, well that just makes it even more hilarious and great. If you like Razor Blade Smile and Modern Vampires, then you'll like this movie."
2,Awful vampire movie,"A woman is attacked by a vampire and becomes 'an accident'. Turned into a vampire without approval of the local clan, her sire must hunt her down and kill her.Fairly poor movie, but the only one I've ever seen that has a vampire dwarf."
1,The worst MOVIE ever,"if i could have given negative stars, this one would get it. this acting makes elizabeth berkeley look like meryl streep.DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE"
1,"JUST HORRIBLE, ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, HORRIBLE","The screenwriter, producer, and director should be shot for even considering to make this movie. It enters a whole new realm of suckiness that I didn't know existed until now. Please, if you're going to make a movie, put in a little effort for Christ's Sake..."
3,"Amusing, but not hilarious.","I'm a big fan of Stewie, and might go so far as to say I think he is somewhere on the short list of best cartoon characters of all time. however this tome, as Stewie refers to it, leaves me wanting a bit.I haven't finished the book, as it's been relegated to the bathroom. A perfect spot for it, I think. Not because it stinks, but rather it's only amusing in smaller doses.Much of Stewie's appeal is in the delivery, his humor doesn't quite make the translation to the written page.Don't get me wrong it's funny at times, I just haven't cracked up the way I do watching the show."
2,Nothing compared to the show...,"I am a big Family Guy fan; I have seasons 1-3 on DVD, tape the new episodes when they air on Sunday nights on Fox, and can't wait for season 4 to be on DVD. However, I have to say that ""Stewie's Guide to World Domination"" was rather disappointing. It seems as though Steve Callaghan is just trying to get rich from putting the ""Family Guy"" stamp on this book. Many of the jokes are rehashed from episodes of seasons 1-3. And instead of using this book as an opportunity for fresh new visual gags, there are simply just pictures from various episodes with maybe a few photoshopped words added to them. In the end, I gave it 2 stars becasue there are a few good one liners, but I think that it is ""Stewie's"" voice that really makes lines like those work and you really can't get that from a book. An audiobook with Seth Macfarlane reading the book with the Stewie voice may have been a better idea."
3,Out of this world ... but then again so am I,"I don't agree with the previous reviewer ... Alien Art is not such a bad book, but you have to be willing to view it with an open mind. Books like this allow art to be taken to a larger audience ... even to new worlds. I am all for making art more accessable,"
2,Surprised at all the good reviews,"Well, I guess I'm the only jerk that didn't really like this book lol. You can call it an ""oral history"" if you want, I call it a book full of random quotes from Wood's entourage. I would have liked it better if the quotes were maybe mixed in with a more precise history of his life, but it's literally all quotes from interviews from people that worked with Wood. Oh and some exerpts from Wood's more trashy pulp stories."
4,A must read if you are into Ed Wood,"The 1994 movie was fun but doesn't capture Ed. Not saying this book does (I never knew the man so how would I know for sure?) but you get much info about the events leading up to and long after the '94 movie left off. it's a sad book really, because Ed was a complex guy who lived for alcohol and the last ten years (or so) of his life was downright horrible. In short, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get to know the real Ed Wood, warts and all."
4,Thoroughly researched oral history of a fascinating person,"Like many, I became interested in Ed Wood in the late 1970s when Plan 9 From Outer Space was named ""Worst Movie of All Time"" by film critics. This book uses the oral history form to flesh out the life of this very strange but somehow likeable man. This book is scrupulously researched, edited and assembled from interviews and documents. It's an entertaining and interesting read. The book was the basis of the Tim Burton film ""Ed Wood."""
1,Poorly written.,"If you're into mundane, she's your gal. This woman does not in anyway know how to use language as a creative tool. I found this book amateurish and the storyline to be a worn out tale that is best left to the originators."
4,Good add on to C+C,"This is a fun game that adds some more units and upgrades and also some other goodies. If you like C+C generals but want some more scenarios, this is a good fit"
5,A great way to pass time enjoyably,"I bought this book about three weeks ago and can already play a few simple peices.The accompanying cassette makes playing tunes all the more easy. I play guitar and am really into Celtic sounds. On a personal note, my grandfather used to play one quite well according to my mom but I was too young to remember. Now I am even more motivated ! BUY IT ! You won't regret it."
5,"Learn to ""whistle""","Excellent intro to the tin whistle. The book starts with an overview of reading music, and takes you from beginner to intermediate songs. I got the spiral bound version of the book, which is a bit easier on a music stand. A few pages of history, and some background on most tunes keeps it interesting. The CD really helps to understand how the sheet music is meant to be played. Well thought out; recommended."
5,Amazing!,"The ease of use for this guide, and the way it teaches you slowly and effectively makes it top notch! Highly recommended for those who wish to learn the Tin Whistle."
5,Great book for learning tin whistle,"This wonderful book (with included CD) is a great way for a beginner, like me, to learn the tin whistle. Mr. Ochs starts by explaining the history of the whistle and the basics of musical notation for someone who has never read music or forgotten how. He then shows you the fingering for the first three notes (BAG) of the whistle in the key of D. You next play exercises and simple tunes to develop your playing and your ability to read music. I've moved on to the next three notes (FED) and I'm playing more complex tunes. If only I had had Mr. Ochs as a music teacher many years ago! For the small price of this book and a tin whistle, you can have hours of fun."
5,Great book to learn the penny whistle,"I purchased this book along with the CD, and I've found it to be an excellent tutor. The lessons build upon each other, and it logically flows. Replaying the CD tunes has helped me become more proficient, and I'd recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn how to play."
4,A great way to learn a lovely instrument!,"I've listened to lots of Irish music, and have always loved the sound of the tin whistle, although I thought it would be too complicated for me to play. This great combo of tape/instruction book demystifies the process, and within a short amount of time one can play lovely pieces. Having the tape really helps to focus the player on the music. Recommend for the beginner and intermediate to advanced players as well."
4,A great tutor for the beginnig or advanced whistler!,"This is the songbook and cassette combination that taught me to play the penny whistle! This book takes from the basics of playing the whistle, through advanced ornamentation such as crans, rolls, cuts, and strikes. Including several dozen songs, this book is an excellent resource for any whistler."
5,The GREATEST Thinker in human history,"I used to think that the greatest thinker of all time was Kim Il-Sung. But now I realize what a mistake that was. His son--Kim Jong-Il--is an even more extraordinary talent.I have never encountered such a tremendous intellect. I read this book nine times so far and I still don't think I have even brushed the bottom of its profundity.You should buy this masterpiece right now. If you don't have the money, FINANCE IT! Your life is hollow until you experience the dear leader's thought."
5,A Masterpiece of the Twentieth Century,"It is a true blessing to be able to read and write for which I am eternally greatfull. One of the many perks of this ability is that it enables me to get in touch with novel ideas and great controversies. Reading this book by this great Korean leader and the best man of his country put me in true ecstacy. The depth of his work is so immense. Yet he is able to put the most complex problems of his country in so simple terms that one begins to wander if his career would be better off as a writer or a philosopher. How he explains the evolution of mankind, the importance of science and steel production is pure magic. I recommend that all young intellectuals as well as workers should carefully read this work. Forward to the triumph of socialism!"
3,Semi-Valuable Snoozefest,"Just about anything that summarizes the material appearing on the MPRE can be helful. In that sense, this study tool earns a few stars. You get some practice questions and an outline. If you haven't taken Professional Responsibility (or Legal Ethics) then you'll definitely need something like this. Even if you did take a course it might not be clear which material will be on the MPRE. This will help you know what to memorize. The presentation is absolutely horrible though. It's just soooo boring (the DVD in particular) and not very in-depth. On the plus side, however, it is extremely cheap compared to some alternatives."
2,didn't pass,"Everyone says the MPRE is a blow-off exam and that you can ace it without studying. I wanted to increase my chance of passing by studying, so I bought this book based on the outstanding reviews here. I followed the instructions, watched the DVD and took all 3 practice exams, which I scored very high on. All in all I spent about 10-15 hours studying using only this book. I was confident going into the exam. However, scores came in yesterday and I fell well below the needed score for my jurisdiction.I'm not sure I'd recommend this book to someone else. A book on MPRE test-taking strategy would have been more helpful and likely prevented me from having to take the November exam."
2,"No pass, no good","Failing the MPRE won't end your life or hurt your pride, but it is REALLY ANNOYING.All you need to do with the MPRE is pass. That said, if you'd rather not study for... wake up for... and lose a Saturday for the MPRE *twice*, I highly recommend another method of review.This book does not reduce the chance of failure *quite* enough in New York (pass = 85). The DVD lecture is dull, and I didn't find the practice questions predictive of success on the MPRE.After reviewing with Supreme Bar Review the week before the November '07 MPRE, I got an 82. You MAY pass with Supreme, but the chance of NOT passing is still high enough that I don't recommend it. 2 of my friends also used Supreme: one is at the top of our class and passed by a few points, and the other failed by several points.I took the free Pieper class before the March '08 MPRE, read over the notes several times and took 2 practice exams. I passed by a landslide."
2,Buy something else,The outline is adequate BUT the real value are the explained answers to the questions. If you want to learn the material - find a better study aid - this is a Band Aid.
1,inadequate,"I used this book as a primary study guide and took the MPRE a few days ago. Following the exam, it was clear that this book was an inadequate source. The outline/review of the model rules was poorly written and disorganized; and rules that were critical to answer choices on the exam were not covered in the outline. I recommend finding a more comprehensive source."
1,"Incomplete, out of date, and misleading",This product contains questions from earlier MPREs that do not reflect the current state of the exam. Do not purchase.
5,"MPRE, great review tool","This book was very helpful. Although it may not have included all the topics we went over in my Prof. Resp. class, its an MPRE review book. There were several questions from the book on my exam."
1,This Book is Not Very Good,"I didn't take the MPRE too seriously, but picking this book was a big mistake. The outline skips over a lot and the DVD does not prepare you for the most difficult questions on the exam."
2,Too many typos!,"The book is full of typos. What does Professor Lazarus say to students who submit papers with this many typos (missing parenthesis, misspellings, wrong words, bad spacing)? The content of the book seems adequate. The DVD is horrifically boring (the Professor reads from a paper on his podium - couldn't they spring for a teleprompter?). For the price - this will do the trick, but don't expect a very polished product."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I have bought many things off of Amazon and never have felt the need to write a review. Supreme Bar Review should be ""subject to discipline"" for actually charging money for this product and touting it as a sufficient study aid for the MPRE. I strongly recommend that this book SHOULD NOT be purchased.I bought this to help prepare to take the MPRE for the second time because I am planning to take the bar in another jurisdiction and my prior MPRE score has expired.The outline is completely inadequate and vague.The ""web lecture"" is available for free on YouTube and the lecturer basically reads off of the outline verbatim.Most of the book consists of practice questions and a practice test, which are essentially a reprint of the materials available on the NCBE website.Most of the pages came off the binding while I was doing the practice questions."
3,"Decent aid, but consider Bar-Bri too.","Enrolled in and managed a B in Professional Responsibility during the Summer of 2010. Purchased SUPREME REVIEW mid-way through the PR course as a supplement for the final and the August 6th MPRE. Listened to the lecture twice and borrowed a friends Bar-Bri prep-book, in which I worked the 4 practice exams over a 7 day period. Still awaiting results ( anxiously) but can recall at least 2 questions which SUPREME prepared me for on test day."
2,"With a voice like SPEDDINGS, you need the guitar to do the talking","Unfortunately that does not happen on this cd. Some of the lamest covers of blues classics with one of the most horrible voices in music. Not one redeeming feature. I thought maybe a cool solo here and there and it would be listenable. Well there aren't any on this cd. It is as if he has also forgotten how to play the guitar, or this effort was phoned in from a stoned day in the west indies. The old chestnut ALBATROSS is the best track ( that should give you some idea ).There are really no others that are worth mentioning, so i won't.Save your money. This one is not worth it. I'd love to know who the cretin at the record company was that ok'ed this project and released the thing. I hope he is working behind a KFC counter by now."
1,Don't Bother,"I'm a huge fan of Mr. Jones and thought I would be getting a great ""selection"" of his songs, new and old, with some new duet vocals. I was extremely disappointed!! The tracks sound ""tinny"" and have little emotion in them. The duets make no sense, like how long ago was Audrey Landers?! In the version I bought, the duets aren't even full-fledged songs, most are snippets.Do youself a favor and use the money for this particular CD and put it towards another! You'll be happy you did!"
5,I love it.,"I use this with a PC running on Windows XP Home Edition SP2 and it works marvels. Damn, I didn't even need to install the drivers that came with it. I just grabbed the USB cable, plugged it in and started making sequences on Sonar 4.No latency, nothing.I recommend this product for both PC and Mac users."
4,full scale,"This keyboard works as advertised.The real jewel is the bundled software.The keys are full size so this thing is bigger than you might thinkI'm glad I did not get the 61 or 88 key keyboard. Those things must be huge.While large, it is very light and will easily sit in your lap as long as the chair has no arms.My only gripe is that the keys make a clunking sound at full stroke so if you are playing it while wearing headphones to not bother others, you will bother them with the banging sound the keys make bottoming out."
4,Keystation Keyboard,"I bought this keyboard for use with Garage Band. It works great with this interface. I am able to easily create songs and transpose the music. This piece suits its purpose perfectly. I teach Core Knowledge music to K-2 students. It was a snap to take it out of the box, plug it in, and play. Very good item."
2,"XP doesn't always recognize, materials are CARCINOGENIC","Thankfully another reviewer brought to my attention the fact that this M-Audio keyboard is made of chemicals including lead that can cause cancer. You are actually advised to *wash your hands* after handling. Will you find the warning displayed on the box? Nope, it is at the bottom of the last page of the manual. Nice.Add to this the problem I have with Windows XP recognizing this keyboard (have to really work at it) and this is a total piece of junk."
1,MIDI controller generates error with MC-303 sequencer,"I bought one of these to control my Roland MC-303 sequencer. It generates a ""err 02"" after pressing a few keys. Will not make music for more then a few seconds. Tried another one at a local music store and a both a keystaion 61es and 49e, both had the same problem. In talking with the salesman he said that other customers have reported simular problems, sound dropping, error codes with a variety of equipment. It seems that it works really well via USB to a computer but there are many issues with the MIDI out. I they tried a Radium 49 and it worked like a charm. From what I hear the Radium series is made by another manufacturer and is totally different.Bottom line, if your not going to use the MIDI out it would probably work great, it also may work well with some equipment. Just would not work for more then a few seconds or notes with the Roland MC-303.Buyer beware."
4,Great value,This keyboard performs great for the price... Didn't have an extra $1500 lying around so I picked this one up... works great with my Reason 3.0 setup...
3,Not a Neewbie solution.,I bought this keyboard reading the reviews and thinking it was easy to setup. This keyboard does not have sound and does not come with software that anyone would be able to use.
1,Drivers Are Terrible,"Where do I even begin with this? I received it in the mail after reading fairly good reviews, and then tried to install it. Many hours later, after closely following the instruction manual and downloading ""new"" drivers from the m-audio website, I finally installed it on my XP machine. The drivers are not certified, whatever that means, but even m-audio recognizes that. I had to install it several times before it ""took"" and eventually worked. I had fun for a few weeks using this keyboard with Fruityloops, until one day it simply stopped working. My main XP box, my laptop and a friend's computer would not recognize the keyboard, even though I went through the same steps over and over again trying to install it. The LEDs work, so it's getting power, I just don't know what to do with this thing. Now it's sitting in a box in my closet. I don't recommend this product if you value decent, working drivers. And the warranty sucks too."
5,"Five more copies, please....","Since I first put it on, I've been listening to this CD several times a day. Guitarist and engineer Bob Ward and keyboardist Larry Goldings (with the help of saxophonist Tim Ries and other friends) have put together a very impressive collection of tasty grooves, catchy melodic nuggets, fresh-sounding improvisations and classy sounds in this album which evokes the best of what might loosely be called ""acid jazz"" but transcends by far the cliches of this genre. The arrangements are sophisticated yet glow with the kind of effortlessness which most arrangers can only dream about capturing. I was given a copy, and am back to Amazon.com to buy some more copies for my friends!"
3,Val McDermid's Review:,"Disgraced Detective Inspector Robert Graham is exiled to a godforsaken windswept seaside resort where his bosses can forget about him. To stave off boredom, he responds to a plea from the parents of a murdered girl to reopen her murder, unsolved from years before. It's a quest that unsettles the whole town, from the family who run the place to Graham's senior officer.Fitting his inquries round the town's routine crimes and his attempts to resolve his failed marriage, Graham unravels a mess of motives, mysteries and mistakes from the past that threaten to engulf him before he finally prevails in a solution as clever as any I've read this year.DI Graham, with his homicidal Lakeland terrier, is an unconventional copper from the same breed as Frost and Morse. On this form, like them he should win fans and keep them."
3,"Gold, silver, music and ministry compete for souls.","Amy is a young girlwho is being raised by her father and aunt. They have arrived in Colorado as she is beginning to become an adult and finds her love for music and the piano drives a wedge between herself and her family who believe pianos are too worldly for a decent young girl. As seemed typical for the era, gold and silver fever flourished as did houses of ill repute. All played a very important roll in the life of young Amy. The author saved a huge surprise for the readers for which even I was not prepared. I assume this is the beginning of a series."
1,Form Mimics Content,"This is the first time I've read fiction written by Theroux, and it will be my last. The writing is as bad as one imagines that of the protagonist must be. Indeed, there is no discernible difference when the character's writing is revealed to the reader. Self-indulgent, uninspired, maybe the mist of writer's block, this manuscript should have remained in the desk drawer. Hopefully, it was an exercise in preparation for something better."
3,too long but it has its moments,"Some of it is quite well done - how blindness as a choice (because of the drugs he consumes) at first is seen as empowering but eventually becomes a disability when he can no longer control it, the cameo appearances by Clinton, the satire on rich eco tourists, the ego of the main character and so on. But at the end of the day the book is too long and repetitious for anyone except hard core fans - hard core Theroux that is, not pornography. The sex scenes everyone seems to be getting all flushed about are a bit limp really. This book was a worthy candidates for the ""bad sex in fiction award"" -[...]"
2,No More Porno Novels--Please!,"OK Paul, now you've written a dirty book. Please don't do it again. I slogged through it because even when you're bad, you're a good writer, and I've read just about everything you've published. But the weird premise, the unlikely plot, the baroque, excruciating sex scenes, the pretension of name dropping the rich and famous (and the pretension of not name dropping the most famous), the unlikeability of any of the characters--it was pretty awful. The endless scenes with Steadman rattling around in his drug-induced blind horniness got old real fast.There was some good stuff, which others have talked about, so it wasn't a total waste. But at your age, writing so graphically about sex labels you as a dirty old man. You don't want to end up in that category, do you? You can do better than a Henry Miller ripoff."
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!,"What an overextended bad plot proposal. Some cheap shots, e.g., listing famous names at a party, i.e., Bill Clinton! (He did this with Jack Kennedy in Hotel Honolulu.) Don't go here if you want to know about yage; nothing new. A cultivar of a common species of Amazonian Datura. Or not. You never know. An excellent example of the decline of the competence of editors. Skip this one. It never delivers. Oh, yes, a ""Happy Ending"". When did a real life drug addiction ever have that?"
2,Complete misrepresentation of Datura,"This book is full of romaticized reefer madness style clichés about 'drug use' that conflate opiates and psychedelics. Why does Theroux use the name 'datura' for his fictional drug? Datura, an actual psychoactive plant, doesn't cause blindness, isn't addictive, and definitely does not turn people into telepathic sex fiends. It is however fairly dangerous and generally considered unpleasant, see http://www.erowid.org/plants/datura/datura.shtml"
2,Mine started leaking almost immediately,"Unless it's in a place totally protected from the wind, you'll find serious leakage. Pay a little more, get a better feeder."
2,It works but not well,"It has nothing to stop the bees from congregating on it big time and monopolizing the feeder. I'm going back to the one that has the bee guards on it, even if they do fall off sometimes. Poor little hummer can hardly get a chance. Cheap plastic, but at least it won't break."
2,Leaked after 1 month :(,"I purchased this because it has little perches, but after 4 weeks, it began leaking.....badly. So much so, that I ended up with thousands of ants congregating underneath it. Very poorly constructed."
1,Not an Opus feeder - description is wrong.,"I don't know why this photo is connected with my 2007 review, but this is not the same product. The product pictured is the older brown bottle model of the Perky Pet Antique Glass Hummingbird Feeder: [..] which is now made with a red glass bottle. My review was for a now-unavailable Opus feeder."
4,One of the best of this young year,"When Soul's Core came out in 1998 I picked it up on the strength of Lullaby and was very pleased. Since then I lost track of Shawn Mullins and picked up this release because it seemed the only thing of interest in this slow release week. Again, I was more than pleasantly surprised. This is a very strong outing and hasn't been out of my cd player all week. Next is to go back and see what I've missed from 1998-2006."
4,Can't stop listening..........,"I bought this CD several days ago and have not yet stopped listening to it. I absolutely love the first 3 songs with ""Cold Black Heart"" being my absolute favorite on this CD. It has such a great upbeat tempo and the lyrics are classic for a ballad- to me, reminiscent of some of Richard Thompson's celtic influenced ballads. I am a die hard Shawn Mullins fan- have been for many years and really love the fact that he has such a wide range of styles. If you like Soul's Core, you'll like this CD as well."
3,"Too manufactured, overproduced","Shawn is one of those singers that you could listen to all day because of his deep raspy voice, and I couldn't be happier that he's found true companionship and gotten married, but I miss the solo guitar folksinger gigs I used to see at Eddie's Attic or on occasion in Athens. My favorite albums are Eggshells, Canyons & Caverns, Blue Sky, and the two disc Jeff's Last Dance with Matthew Kahler.With Soul's Core, radioheads picked up the catchy Rock-a-Bye tune and ran with it. Shawn Beneath the Velvet Sun was overproduced and seemed as if he had been seduced by technology, i.e. voice effects, strange instrument distortions.While 9th Ward gets back to a familiar style for older fans, the lyrics and delivery don't have the same passion we're used to. With a recording contract I know its difficult to produce your best work, but here's hoping that Shawn can once again find the stories that touch our hearts and can tell them as he used to."
3,Shawn Mullins,Same with this one. I like the music but I definately need to be in a seriously mello mood to listen to it.
1,Agreed,"I agree with the first reviewer. Shawn is a major musical genious. However, this CD is way off base. Sorry Shawn, start playing your music again and get off the soap box."
3,satisfactory maternity hose,"These were not the hose I was looking for, but they are working out just fine! In fact, I think I will be ordering more soon."
3,"Meh, it's a DV tape","Nothing good or bad about them, they work. Not much else to say really. Used one of them several times and no problems."
5,Lancome Miracle is still the Best!,"Lancome Miracle is still one of the best perfumes out there. I've worn Miracle for many years and will never get tired of its beautiful scent...infused w/ freesia, magnolia, & amber notes. Just gorgeous! As often is the case ordering on Amazon.com, I saved on the price (it's normally $77 + tax retail) & the package arrived earlier than expected. Totally Satisfied and Highly Recommend Lancome Miracle."
5,best perfum I'VE ever have,I LOVE THIS PERFUM. THE SMELL IS SO SPECIAL.THE PRICE IS REASONABLE AT AMAZON. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
1,dissappointed,"i ordered lancome miracle here at amazon and the seller is AAA merchant i think,when i got it its not what i expected the smell is like alcohol i dont know if its fake,,nothing compare to dolce and gabbana light blue..you wont notice its smell unless you sniff it closer...<...> is still the best when it comes to perfume."
5,Excelente!!,"Muy seguro, muy buena compra!!!Magnifico de muy buena calidad, muy bonito, estoy muy contento con la compra muchas Gracias!Excelente!!!Excelente!!!"
1,Knock of,"When I got this product it was not what was pictured for sale,it was totally different and did not smell right."
4,Smell good,"I choose this rating, because i liket but i don love it, why? well is not the best smell, i like the product and i would recommend"
5,"Called out of the world, not the Church.","The two previous reviews make several good points which I won't revisit here. Russell Reno has taken a tact in this book which is the antithesis of the via moderna- modern way. Mr. Russell, using the panorama of redemptive history, challenges the modern views of exegesis which are bound by the propensity for both the unique and technique. His basic premise is that the typology of Church history is a people and savior who are perpetually struggling amidst the ruins. As our saviour was called to a prophetic ministry in the ruins of his day, so too, we are called. Mr. Reno also hearkens back to the practices of the Church Fathers- exegesis and bible study - as sources from which the ""wheat"" of the Church may be nourished. Summarily, this book is not a mere recapitulation of the writing which already exists on this topic, but approaches this topic from a fresh and novel perspective. Tolle Lege."
3,<Yawn>,"I bought this video to suppliment a bellydancing class I am taking. Although it did help me understand all the horizontal and vertical circles the body can make, overall it was VERY BASIC and VERY SLOW. The dancers themselves are great and you do get to see a pretty dance in the bonus features. But if you're looking for a workout or any really flashy moves, don't buy this video!"
2,Another Rehash of a Fine Group,This collection is a rehash of a few of the Trios better and more of their fair releases. Everything is on other releases and most of them have a better choice. It is a shame when the beancounters and agents get hold of a good property. But IT IS the TRIO and that makes it a respectable CD if not a great one.
5,a CD with real beauty,"I'm a classical music dork, and so am used to listening to beautiful music all day long. I had occasion to listen to this particular CD, Craig Wedren's Lapland, and I dunno but to me these are really really nice songs. In particular, Love Among The Ruins is so beautiful, so melodic, it actually brought tears to my eyes, and (like re. a great classical piece) I found myself listening to it repeatedly. Why a song like this isn't on the radio, where it would be a number one hit (vs. all those stupid songs that are on the radio) I'll never know."
1,uncontrollable laughter,"is what this album is liable to cause. saw him open up for the wrens, wish i hadn't. hands down the worst performance i've ever seen live. the songs are pretentious and awful. his voice isn't bad, but his music requires it to be as great as jeff buckley's, which it clearly isn't. poor timing pervades all this dmreadful music, including the heavy misuse of dramatic pauses. craig, please give me back my hour."
3,"no headache, headache","Sun Visor is adequate in guarding against sun and does not disturb the hair much but the clips on each side of the head are certainly NOT no headache, it gives a BIG headache. Gives me almost a bruise to wear it for more than 1 hour."
3,slip,"I believe I have an average size head, but this visor does not stay where I would like it. It is actually too loose for me."
3,"A strong author, turning shallow","Where Ms. Lackey's books initially had great depth of chacacter and plot (especially Arrows of the Queen and Last Herald Mage, her first two trilogies), her writing has become increasingly more of a travelogue. It's disappointing to see an author who'd written so well about relationships and major conflicts sink to multi-page descriptions of clothing, housing and parties. Whether the influence is her co-author or just the need to crank out books for the money, I'd like to see a return to the quality and substance of her earlier works."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"I waited impatiently for Owlknight to come out. I have only in the last three years been reading and collecting the Valdemar series. I enjoy finding out what happened to characters from previous novels and seeing how the times have changed within Valdemar. I enjoyed reading the book, but like some of the previous reviews, I found some things lacking. I enjoy seeing how the characters develop and mature, but I feel that the characterization was too slow in this book. I also felt like the plot moved too quickly. I wanted to see reactions to certains situations which weren't there. Don't get me wrong. I really liked the book; I just wanted more. I wanted to see that happens with Keisha and Darien's relationship, and I wonder just how comfortable Darien really is with the situation with his parents. Like another reviewer, I liked learning about the Northern tribes. I also want to know what is to the west of Valdemar. And yes, I will go out and buy the fourth book in this series."
3,hmmm... it's a book,"Having read all of the Owl books, and purchesed none of them, I do find this series to be fun, and refreshingly less bloody than some of her previous books. In response to Lady Tiger, (below) I heard or read a rumor that Ms. Lackey was writing a fourth book in this series. I certainly hope so."
2,I LOVE Lackey... BUT....,"I have to agree with the majority here... I always quote Lackey as my favorite author, but I agree that her latest works just aren't nearly up to par with her earlier works. It's so sad because I used to be in her fan club as a teenager (Queen's Own) and used to tell everyone I knew how wonderful her books are. Last Herald Mage, Arrows of the Queen.... best books EVER WRITTEN in my opinion. I'll continue to read and buy her books, but I just hope, Ms. Lackey, if you're reading this, that maybe you'll take some time off from writing if this is what the demands are doing to you; you need a break and then maybe you can come back to your writing with the care for the characters and their relationships that you showed in your first novels. Because in this series, these characters are far too two-dimensional and non-sympathetic."
2,Getting Lazy,"I agree with many of the reviews of this book that I've read here. The Owl series is certainly Mercedes Lackey's weakest, and I think I've read just about all her books. I don't understand why her editors haven't sent these manuscripts back with a suggestion to cut out 200 of the first 400 pages and add a plot. Possibly they think that we will all keep buying her books no matter what she throws together - and I probably will. But I keep hoping to find a plot, or at least a new idea, and the Owl series has been one disappointment after another. At least her writing still flows and still spreads a feeling of peace over the world ..."
5,owlknight,Owlknight is the 3rd book i have read by Mercedes Lackey and it is one of those books you aren't able to put down until you finish the last page.
4,I enjoyed the Owlknight trilogy,"I have enjoyed all of the Mercedes Lackey books I have read. Sometimes I get the hardcover version from the library and buy the paperback later, when it comes out. My adult daughter, Margo, likes them too. While some of the books may not be as good as others, I have enjoyed them all. I have read all of the Lackey books I own at least twice, usually more often.(...)"
3,Eh.,"It was... OK.And really, there was just way too much navel-gazing teen angst.I can't believe that Valdemar is exploring steam power, and yet still knows little about what's west of their country. It's like Lackey thought, ""Oh, wow, the Lewis & Clark anniversary is coming up! Let's write something like that!!""Kind of like ""Oh, wow, Y2K might take away all our modern conveniences, so let's have the Mage Storms do that to the Empire!""Jeeeez. I'd like to see more about the early Herald-Mages, or what really went down in Iftel. Maybe she touches on that in her gryphon novels, but I couldn't really stand the thought of morrrrrrre connnnnnsonnnnannnttttssssssssssssss than there ought to be in dialogue, so I've not even gone there.And while I'm thinking about gryphons, why did it take flying sentient beings so LONG to make their way to Valdemar?I miss the quality of the Vanyel books.I also wish that the Hawkbrothers had some kind of flaw???"
4,good read,the nice thing about Lackey's writing is the character development that occurs. Darian's tale exemplifies her skill in handling character conflict and growth.
2,it was nice but unsatisfying,"I liked the book, but it was rather shallow. There wasn't really any character development,and all of the personalities are quite linear. The plot had really no excitement. The author could've gotten into detail about a lot more things in the book, like Keisha and Darian's relationship, but everything seemed to be glossed over. The book was nice, but bland. Frankly I enjoyed the earlier books like the Mage Winds trilogy a lot more than this series."
4,It's not that bad!,"I read the reviews here, and it really put me off buying the book. Then my locol library got the book and I desided to read it from curiousity. Now granted, this isn't up to Lackey's usual standards but it beats Owl Sight hands down. The plot wasn't as fast as most of her books, and you did get REALLY annoyed at Keisha at points (but she came through in the end and started acting sensably). This is nice 'cause you get a better idea of Darian's past and it puts a close to that chapter in his life. All in all, not a bad book."
5,Why's everyone being so harsh?,"I'm giving this book five stars, not because it's Misty's best work, but because even Misty's worst work would be amazing compared to most of the stuff on the market. I really don't think this book deserves a bad review. I thorougly enjoyed it and, while the Owls trilogy wasn't as good as LHM, it was still some really increadible writing. After all, what is as good as LHM? I mean, really? All I'm saying is that I don't think Owlknight deserves some of these bad reviews, and it would be a big mistake not to read it because of them."
2,Disappointed,"I agree with some of the other reviews here but would also like to add the the story was quite disjointed. The first half of the book focuses primarily on the Hearld and Shandie's assignment to the area. This is such a primary focus that you are completely surprised when the main character suddenly decides to go find his parents. So the last half of the book is about a personal quest for family, the first half about politics and clash of culture. I was disappointed and wondered if Ms. Lackey was in a hurry to finish the book for publication. I also thought the timing of the book was off, the second volume ended with the main character getting his owl and by Owlknight he is a full adult. I feel like we missed a lot of adventures and growth for this character."
1,Oh how the mighty have fallen..,"I waited with bated breath for her newest novel to come out. What a let down in all areas. Have the two switched rolls??? Is Ms. Lackey doing the pictures and Mr. Dixon writing the book? That seems like the most likely occurance....the plot was non-existant, and the pictures were lousy. Nothing in the book was up to what I thought of as their normal standards. UGH!!!!!"
1,What Happened,"We all remenber Mercedes Lackey the amazing hard core new auther who mixed fantasy with strong social messages about child abuse and charater growth and a hundred other things and tied them all up with riviting story telling well the storys have been going down hill for some time now, since the Mage Wars books maybe, but this is a new low the characters are all sickly sweet nice and completely interchanable with one another and the social message seems to be a good sing along and a talking animal can solve all your problems I hope that everyone who reads this straight away goes back and reads the Heralds trilogy and maybe Sacred Ground before they forget why they were Mercedes Lackey fans to begin with."
3,"Good, but needs help...lot's of help...","Ms. Lackey, you're a great author, but I want to read more about the Heralds, not some lovestruck idiot who runs around with an odd Healer. Can we get some more about Kerowyn, or have the Empire launch an attack, or something? I mean, it is way too ""and they all lived happily ever after"" in this trilogy. No more tears for Vanyel or Kris, no more passionate romances. As much as I love the Hawkbrothers, this trilogy just doesn't compare. Let's have something happen, not just have an idiot mage tromping around in the forest with his mate. Let's get some action! Good luck...."
4,"Hmmm...Can't Complain, but.....","Mercedes Lackey is a professional writer, and if anyone thinks they can do better, give me a call, and let me read your stuff, but still I do agree that this book wasn't equal to her earlier books. The plot was plausible, and the characters stable, but the end was a little too convient and quick. It left me feeling incomplete and wondering about ""What happens next?"" In the course of her books, Ms Lackey has led us to believe that the Mage-Gift is hiereditary. if this is true, did Darian's parents have the Gift? More importantly, did his new siblings? Will the ley lines ever grow enough power for him to become an Adept? You want to know what happens in the future. It leaves you with questions, and I hope Ms. Lackey will explore it a little deeper."
3,A solid conclusion.,I felt this book tied up a lot of loose ends but I also felt that some parts didn't add up or were just added in to make the story run. I enjoyed the book but it did leave me asking questions.
1,NOT UP TO PAR FOR LACKEY,"I was quite disappointed when I read the ""Owl"" books, and then I logged onto Amazon and read all these other disappointed reviews. And I have to agree with them. Compared to her early works (Arrows of the Queen, etc.), the characters in these latest books are shallow, two-dimensional, and.. well, just not very interesting. I hope that she returns to the quality of work found in her earlier books and refrains from putting out any more such shallow nonsense."
3,Rushed,"I think that Misty wanted to write a tetralogy, but her editors or publishers insisted on a trilogy. Darien completing his magical training and his quest for his parents could each have been the subject for a separate volume. As it is, she tries to squeeze both stories into one book, and neither is told as well as it should have been."
3,Move on Misty,"what a bummer of a book. i haven't quite finished reading it yet, but so far it hasn't kept my attention nearly as well as every other book she has written has. not only do i not care much about the charaters i am also getting sick of the time period. i understant that that was a chaotic period in Valdamars history, but there have been plenty of others that i would be nice if she would explore. how about a series on the founding of Valdamar? or more stuff on some of the other countries? i just don't see why she is still staying on the same time period when just about everything traumatic that can happen has. well to anyone that is thinking of trying mercedes lackey for the first time i do not suggest this novel. i really hope that it doesn't become charateristic of her."
1,Great Musicians - Terrible Recordng,"I was severely disappointed by this album. I never heard anything with Eric Dolphy that I didnt like, but as the other reviewer states this is an exceptionally bad recording. I doubt that I will ever listen to it again. For completists only."
2,Available At Hardware Stores For Less,"The shipping cost makes this filter much more expensive than one you can buy at any hardware store. Strangely, only the sides of the filter basket are metal mesh. The bottom is just solid plastic, no doubt saving the manufacturer a few hundredths of a penny. The solid plastic bottom makes cleaning it a little more difficult, too. The hardware store variety has a better flow-through design - metal mesh sides and bottom."
2,Good Product - Very Poor Shipping Package,"I was very dissatisfied with the shipper's packaging of this product. The retail packaging is simple cardboard box. The seller sent it to me in a PADDED ENVELOPE, which at some point got crushed by the USPS.The product's plastic framework withstood this treatment and popped back into shape, but the gold-plated metal filter has a dent. So, it's functional and I'm not going to bother returning it.My issue is that I paid $6.68 to get this shipped to me. So, my $12 coffee filter costs me ~$18.00. I might as well have gone to a Bricks and Mortar establishment to purchase this and gotten an undamaged one for the same price."
2,Not the world's greatest filter,This is the same filter that comes with Black and Decker coffee makers. I don't like the plastic bottom because it prevents all the water from draining into the coffee pot and is harder to clean. I plan to buy a replacement that has mesh on the bottom. You can also find some at grocery and hardware stores that have mesh bottoms and they don't cost a lot of money.
4,Permanent Coffee Filter,It works very well and is more convenient than paper filters. Shipping was unbelievably expensive and hating paying so much for shipping.
5,So they're Thin,"So they're thin paper sleeves. I've read some reviews and some folks complained about the thickness of the paper, and I assure you, that if all you want to do is protect your discs, these are for you! Where can you get 100 sleeves for such a crazy low price? In another year or so I'll just have to check my budget and see if I can afford another $3.97 or you can go to Staple's, Office Max, Office Depot or the like. Come On people."
4,Does the job,I needed to organize my dvd's and cd's so I ordered these sleeves and they are a tremendous help. Now all of my discs are neat.
1,Don't buy this...very cheap quality,The paper is so thin that it literally falls apart when you fold the top flap. For a little more you can buy so much higher quality.
2,Far too thin. Almost too thin to use.,The paper is just slightly thicker than tissue. It is acceptable only for well boxed archival use -- NOT FOR DAILY or WEEKLY USE.
2,Primero CD paper sleeves,These CD sleeves are just too thin. The are all made in China which is to be expected but there are better quality ones made. Watch out for the cheapest sleeves. They may not perform as you would want. Amazon performed as expected but should check into the product before agreeing to have them on their purchase program.
5,dvd sleeves,they are a very great deal and they are very well made and i would buy them again if you buy them you will be well satisfied.
2,VERY THIN AND TEAR UP AFTER ONE USE! DO NOT BUY!,I bought these sleeves to transfer cd's to my work place to listen at work. These things are so thin that half of them tear (back literally comes totally apart) after sticking the CD in them ONE time! I've never had sleeves as cheap and flimsy as these. Save your money (or spend a little more) on decent sleeves. These are barely worth a dime! I feel I got ripped off. Total disappointment!
4,Not Too Horrible,"No, they're not memorex or some other high name brand but they do the job. I purchased these before at a higher price and just ordered more. What i do find funny is 3rd party merchants saying buy for one cent and ""Oh 5.99"" to ship. Cracks me up ."
5,Greatest Deal for Sleeves,"I usually pay $5 for these in my neighborhood at the flea market. This is the first time that I have seen these at such a cheap price. $3 and free shipping? Wow, I don't even have to leave my house anymore to get them.Fast shipment, and they look exactly like the picture! What else can I say? Save your money and get these. Save your discs from being scratched by your kids and get these :-) They are very handy to have around."
5,CD & DVD Paper Sleeve 100 Pack,"Great sleeves for your CD's & DVD's for the price.Does not come in box, but who need it for this price."
5,Great value,We were impressed with the great value and the fast service we received.Will order more from this company in the future.
1,More Chinese trash,"I have been buying similar sleeves for years and have been happy with them. However, this batch from China is of inferior quality. The cellophane window is only partially glued to the paper, making it tricky to carry out the simple task of putting a DVD in its sleeve. I wish Amazon would have a policy of forcing sellers to state the countries of origin for their merchandise.Please note: I had to give it one star above, because apparently 0 stars is unacceptable."
2,"Ok, I get it. She's plain...","How many times does the reader really need to be reminded that our heroine is a plain Jane? Apparently about 30 times or so to make sure we get the fact she's not a babe. Fine. She's plain. Move on.When I find myself talking to the heroine, telling her to get a backbone, it's always a bad sign. Jane is brave on occasion, but is an utter doormat and victim when dealing with her father, another person who reminds us Jane isn't pretty. Her willingness to be abused by every man in her life made me a little sick.And, the sad attempts at humor by changing cliches and sayings into vampiric mottos got tiring very quickly.The book had a great premise, but a good editor would have made a huge difference in this book."
2,How does one fall in love with a jerk?,"Regardless of the paranormal/comedic premise, this is first and foremost supposed to be a romance. I just don't understand how the heroine fell in love with the hero since he repeatedly tells her how much better he can do than her and how ugly she is. The book's popular-at-the-moment sub-genre notwithstanding, it's old-school in that the hero doesn't show the heroine much affection or respect until the very end of the story when (of course) she's in danger. That's not original, it's just an old, worn-out plot device that most contemporary romance authors and editors (thankfully) eschew."
1,Reluctant to read,"This book reminded me of the Cheshire cat, it is laughing so hard at its own jokes that it disappears without a trace. Yes, this book is so taken up with its own exquisite humour that it is not funny, not even enjoyable.The reluctant miss of the title, is Ethel Jane Van Helsing, who belongs to a certain family of vampire hunters.Alas, the poor girl is not following in the family footsteps well, in a word - she's hopeless. Given a new chance to prove herself in nabbling the Earl of Wolverton, she lands herself in fresh pickles and prat falls. The tale follows a steady course, poking fun at both Regency and vampire tales.It just doesn't work, despite hitting the occasional humorous mark. This is not simply due to the woeful historical inaccuracies with which it bristles.No, a parody must actually be genuinely funny and not just telling you it's funny by hitting the reader over the head with gags and giggles."
1,This book gives pop culture a blow to the mouth!!,"The author spends a great deal of the book's 342 pages attempting to impress the reader with her knowledge of pop culture and cramming as many references as possible in between the teensy bits of plot that the book contains. I get it! You've watched Buffy! You've seen Bela Lagusi movies! You know who Bram Stoker is! The cutesy references quickly become annoying distractions. Overall, the 342 page novel is a pleasant 75 - 100 page short story."
2,"I really wanted to like it, but...","I just didn't. The constant puns and pop culture referneces were annoying by the fifth page. By the 300th page I had a headache from clenching my jaw. But the bigger sin, for me, was the utterly unlikeable ""hero."" He was a flat-out b@&%!$d. He was insufferably arrogant and cruel to our Miss Van Helsing and had absolutely no redeeming qualities. He was described in great detail as breathtakingly handsome, but nothing makes up for his selfish nastiness. And this wasn't just a case of Alpha male or vampire sensibilities; the guy was just a jerk. I kept hoping and hoping our heroine would just leave --- walk out and find a new book to star in!"
3,Not impressed,"I really wanted to like this book. There was so much that could have been done with it, the potential was there. I felt like the author was trying to hard to be witty in the beginning of the book. It finally started to pick up when I was almost finished. The only reason I kept reading was because I paid for it and I didn't have anything else to read.If you are a fan of Charlaine Harris, Katie MacAlister, Mary Janice Davidson, etc, please don't bother because this book won't meet your expectations."
1,Less than 1 star--don't bother,"This book has changed the way I buy books. Had I read the first 10 pages, I would have never bought it. It was bad. Very bad. The author tried too hard to be amusing, and it fell flat. Too many word-games, and how is it that she managed to not get sued over this one? I mean, come on, Giles Buffyton? Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,"Eh, ...","If this didn't try so hard to be clever I may have enjoyed it. But since the author works to put something 'funny' in every other paragraph I can't tell, I'm just too annoyed by the inanity of the of the telling."
5,Unhook the Stars (Movie),"An excellent film with talented actors. A real-life drama with little humor. A very touching story about patience, hope & love."
3,SEE JAKE LLOYD CAN ACT,I WANTED TO SEE THIS MOVIE BECAUSE OF JAKE. HE CAN ACT AND IS A GOOD ACTOR I THOSE PEOPLE WHO HATED HIM IN EPIOSDE ONE SHOULD WATCH THIS. OH YEAH THE MOVIES PLOT IS GOOD TOO.
2,This is one of the most screwed up movies I've ever seen.,"When I saw this movie with Gena Rowlands and Marisa Tomei on the cover, I thought it must be good! But in all honesty, it really sucks. It doesn't make any sense. And the character Marisa Tomei plays doesn't know too many more words than the ""F"" word. The only thing this movie will do is make you sad, for the little boy and the old lady (played by Gena Rowlands)."
2,Interesting,"I found this book to be interesting, but I also found that Helen did a lot of rambling. It is evident that she was a very smart person. I have always been amazed at what she was able to do. I wish she would have written more about her interactions with other people. I would have enjoyed reading about them."
4,3.5 Stars,"I particularly enjoyed reading about her dreams and how she 'saw' the world with her hands. However I didn't enjoy the repeated focus on proving that life is just as good or perhaps better without the ability to see. It's a fruitless argument from any side, she was speaking to a different audience of a different time of course but this became quickly redundant."
5,Fits my Panasonic KT2570,"How to review a battery? It fits my Panasonic phone, old battery was on it's last legs, lasting less than an hour. Old battery was about 6 years old, it's time was up."
1,Supports breeding mills,"I think Sally knows a lot about parrots as pets, but she supports a bird store with one of the biggest bird breeding mills around - Bird Paradise. [...] Sally speaks every year at the Bird Paradise ""parrot palooza."" Why is she supporting a store like this one?"
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"This book is fantastic. It has just the kind of information I was looking for. As a first-time parrot-owner, I was desperate for real guidance. Sally's style is very relaxed and you can hear the voice of experience. Her love for these wonderful birds fills every page, and she makes it all very entertaining. I find myself laughing out loud while reading it. Don't be scared off by the price - it's DEFINITELY worth it."
4,Cricket primer,"Finally, something that explains what the game is about for true novices. As an American who now lives in the West Indies and cricket is all the craze. I can now listen to the radio and watch it on television with locals and understand the nuances of the game. Once you read this you'll be able to carry on a conversation with cricket fans all over the world and not seem like an typical American when it comes to the game."
5,The Children are Free,"For any Christian who wonders if the Episcopal Church did the holy thing by elevating an openly gay Priest to Bishop, for every Christian who questions if God loves and accepts homosexuals, for all Christians who wonder what Jesus would say about same-sex relationships, this book is the is the answer. Excellent! It is a well researched, clearly written and concisely presented investigation of what the Bible has to say about these confusing and often perplexing questions. Recommended as required reading for every Christian parishoner and Pastor. Especially inspiring for those who have ever experienced rejection by the Church."
5,Good book,I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking for information to counter their more conservative friends when they start spouting scripture at you in regard to same sex marriage.
5,"Love Christ, hate the Christians","This work is a breath of fresh air, dispersing the poisonous dogma of the ""people of the Book."" Perhaps by reading works like ""The Children Are Free"" we will come to our senses and realize that the institutional religions have long been co-opted by political forces into becoming engines of genocide, rather that paths to transformation and revelation. Now that Native peoples (and their cultures) have largely been exterminated, the Church continues to repress the natural man in all of us, enforcing its control by the repression of Love, which is ultimately our only redemption. Thank you, Jeff Miner, for helping set that Love free. The only thing I would add is to recommend some works that back up this book: The Gnostic Gospels by Elaine Pagels and Lovers' Legends by Andrew Calimach, a book about the gay Greek myths, which illuminate the spiritual foundation of gay love."
5,great book,Made me feel better about myself I got it when I saw a show on discovery channel called banned books of the bible but I like the way the explained some of the stories that are still in the bible that wasn't banned and still promote homosexuality. Super fast shipping i will be doing business again
5,Excellent Resource,This is a great resource for anyone trying to heal the hurts of the religious right wing organizations that gain some sort of sick satisfaction from alienating others based upon their sexual orientation. The author did an excellent job identifying what the Bible actually says and just as importantly what it does not say in regards to same sex relationships.
5,"The Love of God Extends to ALL People, Including Gays, Lesbians, and Transgendered","I highly recommend this book to pastors/preachers of conservative mainline churches (such as evangelical churches, and especially the Southern Baptist Church, which I feel has lost its way due to its outspokenness on gays, abortion, and stem cell research.The world is lost and the church doors are locked. Please read this book and examine your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus, our Lord. You just might receive a blessing!!!Mark Castleberry"
5,A book that answers the question it asks.,This book is biblically sound and addresses both the clobber passages so often misquoted on same-sex relationships and other passages not normally considered as speaking to this topic. I have recommended this book to many of my friends.
4,A Wonderful Conclusion to the European Trip!,"This book ends Mandie's trip through Europe in the Summer of1901. Mandie, Celia, Jonathan, Senator Morton, and Grandmother are inIreland when Mandie meets a little Irish girl. Molly is searching for leprachauns, and Mandie and her friends help. Uncle Ned shows up, and helps the search. Their trip is for some reason cut short, and they must return home. Mandie has no idea why, and Grandmother isn't talking. Everyone seems to know something Mandie doesn't. It's a good story, and a great conclusion to the European trip. At the end you also discover who the ""Mysterious Women"" is, and why she followed them. It is a book that lives up to the Mandie name."
1,Best Avoided,"For a book that is about a UI technology you may expect to see maybe a single screen shot. But no. This book is a book about code, code and more code, and not particularly interesting code at that.If you are interested in getting an idea about WPF is and what it will do for you then go elsewhere. If you are having trouble holding down the book shelf, then get this brick."
1,"Nice cover, bad content","The writer is a guru in the field of Winforms applications.The first part of the book is rather from this angle, the Second part discusses the markup (XAML). The book contains much code (C#), enumerations and is as a result, badly readable.It contains no information about the technique behind the WPF, essential for understanding the new generation of applications which you can make.If you want to learn the WPF I reccommend the book ""Windows Presentation foundation Unleashed"" of Adam Nathan. That one is filled with colours impressions and examples, very usefull working with markup."
4,A must have C# programming reverence,"The Petzold books are some of the best for C++ and C# and WPF programming. The drawback to the approach Petzold uses is that one must still invest in another book or two by another author to get the full picture. Petzold for good reason works from the basics and does not use the Visual Studio wizards for the most part. It is important to know both however when developing code. But even so, this is an excellent reference book that has helped me immensely in learning and using C#, WPF and XAML."
2,Don't bother,"Petzold failed on this one.You can only loose time reading it. the author clearly missed the concept here. Yes introducing XAML from the first chapters IS important and also important are images and graphics on a book like that (not to make you understand the concepts, that's not the reason of course). In a later book of Petzold about 3d graphics he starts immediately with xaml.Difficult to follow with unneccesary hardships. Sorry, cause otherwise Petzold is a great author and teached many things regarding MS's product line."
5,Great Introduction to WPF,"This book provides a good overview of WPF. The author's writing style is concise and understandable. There are lots of code samples. Be aware that XAML is not introduced until chapter 19 (there are 31 chapters total). Code is used instead of markup for the first 18 chapters. Overall, I highly recommend this book."
2,Not the best book on WPF,"This book was obviously rushed to market. While Charles' excellent writing style almost makes up for the lack of illustrations, organization and layout, it does fall short.I highly recommend Windows Presentation Foundation Unleashed (WPF) (Unleashed) by Adam Nathan instead. Adam is every bit Charles' equal in writing clear prose and both he and the publisher went the extra mile (and a few months work) to ""get it right""."
3,Ok product,"The neck wrap is easy to heat and easy to use. The only drawback is the ""soothing"" herbs smell terrible. If you can get over the scent, it works great. I would buy another one if the scent was changed or I was able to take the scent bag out."
2,"It reeks, but feels good as long as you're not breathing whilst wearing it.","It has a lovely feel to it, and the shape is ideal for my neck and shoulders. The heat lasts for about twenty minutes and is quite soothing. Alas, it smells like an experiment in herb mixing gone terribly, terribly wrong. The smell lingers long after the pillow has been put in a ziplock bag, and it's extraordinarily foul. A shame, too, as it feels great on my neck and shoulders."
3,heating pad,"Once I received one that was intact (I ordered 2, received 2, but one of the seams was ripped. Sent back ripped one and received a replacement that was also ripped...sent that back too), It seems to work well. I had one before that was much better quality and lasted a long, long time. I am sort of afraid to use this one too much for fear of the seam ripping like the other 2. Very poor quality item. Sorry..."
2,a little small and a little strong smelling,"other than it being a little small and little 'perfumy' smelling, it stays hot long and does help relax the muscles. will get a bigger one and one with less aromas next time."
3,Works well,"I do not regret buying this at all. It heats up really well and does the job. The two downside, for me personally, is that the thing is not completely full or at least fuller. I was disappointed in the amount of filling - I would say half-ful - having expected it to be much fuller after looking at the photo. It does work really well despite and perhaps this helps it not be too weighty.The smell is another issue. I'm sure it will dissipate after time, but it is very strong when you first use it. And the combination of smells can be quite over-coming. I just tuck the 'legs' if you will, behind my head so I can't smell the herbs as much.Other than that, great product."
2,Herbal Concept Hot/Cold Wrap,The product did not get cold after in the freezer overnight... nor did it remain cool...It did not function as was originally thought.... I threw them away!! did not like the material it was made of either... not appropriate for the functional purpose of the product.Would not buy this item again..
1,What a life saver,"I suffer from sinus headaches and find when heat activated and placed around my neck the combination heat and herbal essence relieves my symptoms dramatically. The product is well made, feels good and is everything I had hoped for. Have decided theseproducts will make wonderful Christmas presents. Thank you"
2,Does not look like the picture......,I got one of these to put on my car. The picture does not represent the true color of the product (the actual magnet has a washed out look to it...not bright at all.) It also got waterspots on it after the first rain. Not happy with the product at all.
4,I guess they look a little whiter..,"I didn't see that big of an improvement, but my teeth weren't really that yellow to begin with. I bought the strips because they were on sale at the store. I guess my teeth do look a tiny bit whiter.I noticed that several people experienced pain while using the strips. Personally I didn't feel a thing, so I guess it depends on how sensitive your teeth and gums are. I wore them while showering and getting dressed in the morning. The peroxide does taste pretty nasty though, so be careful when you are putting the strips on so the gel doesn't leak out."
4,ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE DENTIST'S TRAY,"After the tray made for me by my dentist wibbled and wobbled out of shape I was reluctant to pay another several hundred for a new one. Reluctantly, he suggested I use these Whitestrips.Actually, I don't know whether or not his treatment gave me a ""headstart,"" but I couldn't be happier with the results from this product."
4,Crest Whitestrips,"So far, so good. They are easy to use, but do not extend to the molars. The Whitestrips initially caused some tooth sensitivity, but not enough to discontinue the product. The lightening has been gradual but encouraging and I look forward to seeing the result after finishing the two weeks."
3,Works in cleaning my teeth,This product works in whitening the teeth but not a lotI love that it cleans the teeth 2but overallI think this product will suit teens and I think it will work for them
3,crest strips questionable,"being a physician, i am curious.now that i have used these thingies,i believe the better way is to go to one's dentist.it will cost more, but you will receive a better result,and a much faster result."
1,Use at your own risk,"After using the strips a couple of times the process became extremely painful. I did notice a negligible difference in the color of my teeth but nothing spectacular. The next time I went to the dentist I was told that I had three cavities! I take impeccable care of my teeth and was amazed that I would have so many cavities at one time. The only explanation that I could come up with was that the whitening strips had eaten away at the enamel of my teeth and left me with cavities. The whole experience was not worth it. To think, I paid more than $30 to have slightly whiter teeth and a bunch of cavities!"
5,CREST WHITESTRIPS THE BEST ON THE MARKET.,"Hi i was asked to write a reveiw of this product i purchased recently,it is very good and had done an excellant job of whitening my teeth,i am a smoker and i cannot believe how white they have become again,and i will be buying more of this product to give to friends,this is my second order of this product but i m still waiting for this one to arrive,and i know it will definatley arrive,bought through beautiful perfumes,very good.Crest Whitestrips Classic (56 Strips: 28 Upper, 28 Lower)"
4,Good for the long term ... don't expect immediate results,"After drinking coffee for so long, the strips are great for gradual improvement, especially if an overly busy schedule necessitates using them only at night (like mine does)."
3,"Okay for the money, but there is a better option",What works for me is this: I bought the Whiter Smile 35% Bleaching Kit from Amazon for a few dollars more but had trouble with the fit of the dental trays. So I applied the bleaching gel directly to generic whitening strips from Walmart and it worked perfectly; Whiter Smile mentioned using strips as an alternative to trays. I noticed a difference in my teeth after one application of thirty minutes. I didn't notice too much change in the whiteness of my teeth when I used the Crest whitening strips for a week.
1,a pain to deal with,"I used Rembrandt strips before and decided to try Crest. Bad idea! These strips are so tin and narrow. They slide of your teeth if you move your jaw or tongue a little bit. If you have big teeth, these strips are not long enough to cover your teeth completely, especially bottom teeth. So they slide and ride up al the time. And this taste of peroxide along with sensitivity! I had none of these problems with Rembrandt before. They are pretty thick and stay on your teeth secure, no sensitivity and a great result in 7 days with 1 strip a day. So 14 strips only (7 upper, 7 bottom) instead of 56!"
1,Sent as a gift but was not delivered,"This is a great book and I would love to have a copy on kindle and send it to friends as a gift. But it does not work. I hope you can fix this problem or not post it on Amazon and give people hope. I know that you sent a 5$ rebate to the gift recipient but this did not solve the problem for us. We wanted the book, not the rebate."
5,Great intoduction to this important teaching,"I have studied the Original 100 lesson book for over ten years. That study is SO important because over 1/2 of the human race are female. This is a good introduction to the subject. Women around the world are not treated like the eternal spirits they are, made in the image of God.Mankind will be answering to our Creator for this, as He is a just God."
2,"Great Argument, Wrong Point","IN ""God's Word to Women"" Bushnell has invested a vast amount of energy arguing for the equality of women. Clearly the Scriptures declare as much, from the creation details in Genesis through to the New Testament Church. Proponents of women as pastors zoom in on the ""equality"" argument, which is a non-issue, and completely ignore the real issue: God is One of order. He created the world in an orderly fashion, and established Himself as a God of order. In the order of humans, man was created first and designated leader, with woman (as second-created in the order of humans) designated as helper--and God's order has not and will not change.[...]."
2,neo-Gong with a Brazilian feel,"It's kind of trendy to take a whole group of people throw together some half-baked songs with world rhythms and declare oneself to be world-beat, but in my experience no one who has tried to do this has ever topped Gong, the pre-world beat world beat band of the early 70s which has wandered to obscurity. Bottomland clearly does not measure up, which is a shame because they seem so nice. Here's a tip: work on the songwriting. My advice: skip this and see if they get better with their next attempt."
3,Three and a Half Stars,"Heard it on NPR too; rushed with excitement to get it; some very good cuts, like High In The Music; as a Miles Davis fan, I love the horn work; thought the bass playing was outstanding; and I like having a new (or unknown) band cut a disc and get it on the net (thx Amazon); on the cons, I didn't think the disc delivered more than what was on NPR and the production quality is flat to my ear; overall, I thought the disc is at the level of what a good local Mpls band would cut, which may sound like a slam (but isn't) if you aren't from Mpls . . .just ask my neighbor TAFKAP . . ."
1,Poor Product!,"Numark failed on these players, they lasted only three months then the problems started, they conked out on me during a party and I spent over three hundred dollars to get them fixed, and then they had problems again after that, don't buy these, you will be sorry!"
4,No Secret Who Did It,"This was a light, fun read, as were the past two in this series. The characters are so reminiscent of the TV series it's like watching the show all over again. And, even if you are not familiar with the Diagnosis Murder TV show, you will appreciate the characters. The story is about a double murder that takes place in Hollywood and involves movies stars and, of course, Mark Sloan. The only thing I didn't particularly like about this book was that we know who the murderer is immediately. Instead of trying to figure out whodunit, this is a `how did she do it' mystery. There is no secret as to the murderer, and that kind of left me wishing for more. Still looking forward to many more in this series though - the mystery is lighthearted, and the characters are funny."
5,A Great Book!!!,I loved the show and am completely in love with the books. This is a typical set up and great reprise of Dr. Sloan and his cohorts. A must read if you loved the series. A great way to continue to enjoy the series now that the tv show is gone.
4,"The ""Good Bad Man"" rides again!!!","""The Silent Man"" is Bill Hart at his best. He created the persona ofthe ""good bad man"" and at the time it was new and exciting. Reviewersat the time couldn't find fault with any of his films, even the onesthat were not quite up to the mark (""Blue Blazes Rawden"" was not a greatmovie - it was not set in the West but in the North country, where Hartplayed a wild lumber-jack, finally redeemed through the kindness of themother of the man he killed).""The Silent Man"" was more like it. The beautiful ornate titles and thewonderful Western scenery make this a great introduction to William S.Hart. He plays ""Silent"" Bill Marr, who discovers gold but then has hisclaim stolen by ""Handsome"" Jack Pressley (Robert McKim was a staple ofHart's westerns. Throw in a pretty girl (Vola Vale was considered one ofthe great beauties of the day), a hero worshipping kid brother and apriest that is building a new church and you have a typical Hart Western.I would highly recommend it."
4,Long Overdue Hart,"This DVD release contains 2 of Hart's films -One as a lumberjack and the other as his usual cowboy character. Each film runs just under one hour and both are basically fair films- nothing spectacular. The print quality for each film are quite good with suitable piano score backing. It's about time some of William S. Harts films became available on DVD rather than being locked up in some film archives around the world. Thanks Alpha video for this release , hopefully more will follow soon."
2,a disappointing book,"Adam Hamilton does a decent job of explaining both sides of some hot button topics in the church, but in his desire to not offend anyone he stops short of fulfilling the book's title. I expect a pastor to reveal biblical truth and answer the question, ""What is right?"". Mr Hamilton manages to smile at both sides of every issue with out ever taking a personal stand. The book should be retitled ""Weaseling out of the Controversies."""
2,Not Quite...,Sooo this book is kinda sorta not really funny. Look someone is selling their used copy for 3 cents that should give you an idea of how pleased you will be with your purchase. I'd save this one for the easily entertained.
3,Why you shouldn't buy this book,"I liked this book, but I wouldn't buy it. It's a good library while your little trailor park princess is at story hour (You must read the book to understand.). I personally don't think my name sounds like a dog's sneeze and I thought that the vowel sound names being changed to a non-vowel name (anna to bananna or like already mentioned agatha to ragatha) were overly childish. There are some extremely funny parts, like the whole princess and her daycare court, but some parts are, well, annoying. It HAS helped me in deciding a name for a girl child. Sanskrit for self-control: Damyata."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have only read the first half (girl names) and I couldn't believe how stupid this book was. It has it's funny parts and it's parts that are true, but most of his ideas were more than a little on the dumb side. Totally disappointing."
2,Might work elsewhere,"After using the JVC Video Head Cleaner, my vcr still did not work. I took the top off the unit, cleaned the heads with alcohol and BINGO, it now works."
4,Emotions simply portrayed,"This deceptively simple book provides a solid and strong read-aloud for the youngest listeners. The author helps children to name and put words to their strongly felt emotions. And the illustrator provides vibrant drawings of the animals named in each simile. Without screaming ""multiculturalism"", this lovely book also shares some of the environs of S. Africa. JAFTA has stood the test of time with my two toddlers."
5,Astonishingly good sound and ease of use,"I bought it to convert >2,000 cassette tapes and vinyl records to digital on my new laptop for later burning CD's or just saving on computer. (This would not have been necessary if HP had spent a few bucks and installed a line-in jack on its laptop). Using the Behringer, the sound was much better than the lousy plugs and jacks HP provided, with the additional benefit of providing line-in. Set-up and use were very easy. I'm very pleased, especially for the price."
4,"Good, for a while","I hate cables coming out of my laptop, so I got the idea to use this so I could export sound out of the USB port and save one more attachment when using the machine with my 30 inch monitor. It worked great, fabulously, even giving me the ability to hook up my headphones too. Sadly, I started getting terrible static about 8 months on, which may be related to something called ""latency"" from reading the articles on the company's site. Sadly, there is no direct support for Macs and OS X although it works fine, and a mail I sent to the company has not been replied to (bad). Since it worked before and so well, I'm buying another one which I'll return if it also gives the static (indicating that Mac had messed something up with a software update or something)."
5,Great item and can be monitored with the speakers,"I got this after purchasing a competitor's similar device (iMic) and finding poor reviews from audio purists about that model. This Behringer model had good reviews and was a similar price to I got one to try. It works well and has more rugged construction.When I first set it up, it did not allow monitoring except through headphones. On my Windows XP system, I went to Control Panel and opened Sounds and Audio Devices. Then clicked the Audio tab and changed the Sound Playback device to the usual system device instead of the USB device that was apparently setup when this was installed. Then the music that was being recorded played through the computer speakers fine and that setting stayed when I closed the program and restarted. This was using Audacity for recording."
4,Good for its price.,"It isn't rich on features, but it gets the job done. If you're looking for a cheap recording device, this is fairly good for being only $30. It's not great as a system sound card, because it's pretty limited to the amount of work it can do, but if you need something to record with and already have a sound card, this should be great for you. If you're running Linux, it's supported in ALSA, but you don't have a lot you can do with it at a time. Overall it's good for what you're paying."
2,What's going on?:(,"My U Control seems to be the reason why my microphone keeps making a static noise, and i don't understand why, it's been holding me back on recording, so I am disappointed. :/"
2,Does not play well with software that does not support ASIO,"This is probably a great gadget if your software supports ASIO. If you use something like Goldwave, forget it, no ASIO support so your input comes in as a microphone making volume control very, very hard.Huge pity."
5,arts & crafts,"A+ product. Durable, a decent quality product. Brushes retain shape through out the project."
5,Works,"Works, does what it should so far. I've had bad luck in the past with other companies but this one works just as it should. Sorry for the long review where I just repeat myself but amazon insisted I write more than the first 7 words I had originally typed. Jerks..."
5,Great Item / Great Value,My wife has tricolor bracelets and I bought her these rings to match them and she loves them! [...] it was a true homerun purchase of unbeatable value. Rings look great and the diamonds sparkle nicely. Highly recommend.
2,So So,Pros: The rings had a nice weight for the current prices of gold (averaging $86 a ring for a set of 3) and it would be hard to dent or bend the bands. Most could wear these on a daily basis and only get normal wear to the surface. Even though there is three rings I ordered my normal ring size and being they are skinny in width they fit my finger (I usually have to order a size larger for stack bands to account for the ring widths).Cons: The bands widths are skinny making it hard to notice the tri-color contrast. The diamond quality is very poor. The diamonds are extremely tiny and when you inspect them they are milky grey in color. I don't even think there is a diamond grade for this kind of quality. :(It wasn't what I was looking for and returned the set.
4,i Love it!,"When you will look at the 3 rings it looks like a child ring but if you all of them, it so elegant...Can't stop staring at them <3"
4,Sleek Elegance,These rings are very sleek and modern. The diamonds shine nicely in the right light. The rings put together are smaller than imagined but still satisfying. I recommend this product for anyone seeking tri-colored gold and sleek elegance.
5,Excellent Insurance Policy for your 1st Trip,"We got this book for our first trip to Maui, what an excellent investment. It helped us plan and easily get to all the places we wanted to visit on the island, plus it helped knowing what to expect. This is a great book, expecially for a first time visitor."
3,all right,"I definitely did not enjoy the book as much as the other reviewers. I liked its content but I thought the maps were too vague to locate some of the harder spots (mile markers on the maps themselves would have been handy!). Also, I found it quite difficult to locate some of the highlighted spots in the book just from its descriptions. It did point out quite of few interesting things that we did do including a couple of great snorkeling spots."
4,Great Information,I really liked the content of the book. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact the cover came off the very first time I sat down to read the book! I am pretty careful with my things and didn't like that about the book. Everything else met my expectations.Ginny
5,Fabulous,"My family lived on Molokai for a decade back in the 1950s. We know of what we speak when we say that this is a fabulous book. The photos are stunning and the writing is terrific. I agree with other comments that suggest you buy the book weeks in advance of a trip. I also look forward to the iBook2 multimedia version, which can be carried on one's iPad. Hoping the author will someday publish such an interactive iBook edition."
5,DON'T GO TO MAUI WITHOUT THIS BOOK!!!,"This book really made our trip special. It's easy to read, accurate and has better pictures than any book on hawaii i've seen. If anything, this book proves that you should NOT SIT BY THE POOL AT THE HOTEL - rent a Jeep and take this book along - you might never come back home. I only wish there were similar books for Kauai and Big Island... hint hint"
3,"Great photos, but","I ordered both this book and Maui Revealed based on customer reviews. The photography in this book is stunning, and it may be worth buying just to have that. I know that I will probably use it to supplement my photos if/when I want to share something about my trip. However,...When actually on Maui, we found that we used Maui Revealed exclusively. The information in Maui Revealed was so detailed, so easily presented, included a lot more different types of activities than this book (the driving guide), and was more compact and therefore easier to carry in your backpack or car, that we didn't use this book at all. For driving instructions, Maui Revealed excelled.If you want a book to inspire travel, with luscious photos, this is the one. If you want a comprehensive tour book with hints about out-of-the-way spots, walks, hikes and activities other than moving by car or taking photographs, go for Maui Revealed."
4,Molokai Driving,"We used this book on our recent trip to Molokai, HI, the maps were very helpful. As the writer indicates, things change on Molokai and some of the business' were no longer open. We did take the drive along the coast and it was very good and pretty much as described. We were glad that we had the book and the pictures are so nice it will make a great keepsake from our trip."
3,Pretty good for road to Hana,"This book's organization is a bit confusing at first, but it has some good information to offer. It has great suggestions and details for the road to Hana trip, as well as a few good restaurants. If you're looking for a book that covers everything on the island of Maui, this isn't it though."
5,Maui and Molokai book order,Beautiful book. Will be a big help for our trip to Maui and to Molokai! Thannk you! Fast shipping too.
5,Fantastic and Invaluable Information and Maps,"On a recent trip to Maui, your ""Driving and Discovering Maui""book helped me save a LOT of time and directed me to the places to get the best photography (I have been to Hawaii several times but your books eliminated a lot of ""wasted"" time in looking for the best shots!) I just wish there was a ""Driving and Discovering Kauai"" and a ""Driving and Discovering Hawaii- The Big Island"" Book to compliment ""Oahu"" and Maui...""thanks, jeff miller"
3,"Great photos, good information","This was a great book to get started planning our trip to Maui. We thought it had great photos and good information about the island. But, the book is large --- we didn't even think about taking it with us. My husband bought ""Maui Revealed"" and we used that book all the time. It fit in our backpacks and in the side door pocket of the Jeep we rented without taking up too much room."
4,Best film version of all the Cirque touring shows,"If you are a fan of Cirque, this is one of the best recordings of their performances ever.The lighting is better on this dvd than on most of the Cirque recordings. Of course, none can ever capture the magic of the live shows, but this seems to be the best historical record.The second cd was a nice bonus, it gave an introduction to the behind-the-scenes show from Bravo (which is also available now on DVD). But on my version there were some technical glitches. Exiting and restarting seemed to take care of the problem."
5,Been bitten by your bird?,"If you are a parrot owner and have experienced the wrath of the beak, look no further. This well-written book is packed with information on training this unwanted behavior out of your bird using a positive approach. The step-by-step approach is backed up with information to help in all situations. Training takes a degree of patience but stick with it and you will have a whole new pet."
1,Don't waste your time.,"Don't buy this stock, it will never fit right to your SKS. Just spend little more money and buy ATI stock"
3,"Magnavox 37"" silver","Picture quality is good. Volume control does not display on the TV which I do not care for. Also after 2 years, the power just stopped working. It would not power up at all. It has been in the repair shop for a week in a half. I believe it may be the power supply and not sure how much it will cost to repair. After researching other sites, it seems likely to be around $250.Highly recommend buying a warrantee if you purchase any LCD TV."
4,Surround Sounds,This tv is the best tv I have ever purchased. Saying that it is my firts flat screen LCD TV. What is the best way to adjust or to get the best quality picture I can. When I watch Cable TV it still seems a little pixelated at times or around the edges. Also how do I hook up my surround sound? I cannot find any audio out jax anywhere. I had my surround sound hooked up to my last 20 inch tube tv by hooking it to the out audio jax in the back. Do I need a certain jack? The stock speakers are good for my room size but im used to having the bass and surround sound. Other than that this tv is amazing for the price and I plan on keeping mine for a long time. Friends and family are very envious of it.
1,"If you buy a Magnavox buy the extended warranty, you'll need it.","We started having problems within the first few weeks. The picture would cut off, randomly, for 20 seconds to 2 minutes. I called Magnavox a few times, I was told to run updates which did not help (I just learned to deal with it). After about 14 months the delayed start, after pressing power, became longer (2-4 minuets). As always I downloaded updates, no help. By 19 months I had to press the power button and hold for several seconds then the power indicator light would come on and eventually the TV would come on. At 21 months the TV stopped working, would not come on at all. I called Magnavox and was told to take it to a repair shop.Twenty-one months too late I went online to research problems with the model/brand and most of the comments stated ""Magnavox TVs typically only last 20-24 months"". I wish I had researched before I spent $799 on the Magnavox 37MF231D/37. Research 1st."
1,buy at your own risk!,"Hopefully more potential buyers will research Magnavox's pathetic track record with their LCD TVs before shelling out the money for their products.It's been barely a year and it's already gone out. Black screen, blinking green light, no picture or sound.The amount of complaints on various boards (just Google it) about this TV's tendency to break down in a very short time, as well as the extreme and woeful inability and unwillingness of Magnavox's consumer department to help, is staggering.BUYERS BEWARE: Purchase Magnavox's overpriced, shoddy products at your own risk. Avoid at all costs. You would be better served putting the money you were going to shell out for it in a tidy pile and setting it on fire."
1,Worst TV I ever bought,"Around June 2007, I bought a Philips/Magnavox 37 LCD TV, The quality is just so, After less than 5 month, the TV is dead. There is no picture.I have bought so many TVs in the past 20 years. This is one with the shorted life.TV Serial Number: BZ3A0636461733"
1,Beware! Do your research!,"Where to start. After about a year I noticed a patch of bad pixels in the top right corner. After about 2 to 2 half years the tv started giving me trouble when powering on. The power light will flash, now for about 10 minutes, then go off. If I continue hitting the power button once it stops flashing and shuts off it will finally power on after about the 4th or 5th try. Total time to turn on about 15 minutes, give or take. I have read on the internet this is a very common problem with this tv. Beware and be sure to do your research before purchasing this tv. I see that all NEW purchasers are pretty happy on average. But its the ones that have had the more experience with this model you need to pay attention to! Good luck!"
2,Not what they used to be.,These have been around for a long time. That's why there called classics. However I have owned at least 5 previous pairs growing up. I was expecting the same pair of CLASSIC K-Swiss shoes. This pair doesn't seem to have the same comfort or durability as before. Seems like I'm cleaning them constantly and I'm way more metro now then back then. If I had to pick one thing out It would be the laces. They turn black from the metal loops they lace through. They didn't used to have metal loops. Sad because these were the best shoes back in the day.
5,Classic and Stylish,"Clean and comfortable. Until I started wearing the K-Swiss Classics, I had never purchased the same shoe twice. I'm on my 3rd pair! What more can I say?"
5,Super comfortable!,"Was leery about buying shoes online, but I have full trust in Amazon, and was not disappointed with the outcome. The shoes fit my husband perfectly. I would recommend these sneakers to anyone."
4,"Very good, but not the same as the original ones I loved years ago.","I love the leather upper. I also own the Luxury Classics with bigger eyelets ans softer thinner leather. Both are good. I miss the red white and blue stitched logos on the tongue and heelcup. The youth model has them. It must be either a money issue, or a demand for a dressier all white. They take a little wear to really break in the leather. The inside heel cup padded lining which touches the foot could be a better leather, thus the 4 stars. (a money-thing there too I bet).the term Classic fits."
1,Smaller than in the Past - Don't Order Online,"Even if you've worn these since the 60s, 70s, or 80s (as I have), do yourself a favor and DON'T order these online. They're smaller than they used to be and after wearing them for decades they no longer fit (too narrow especially). Not only are they hard to find in stores now, but now that most people will be ordering them online they changed the sizing. Worse, if you order direct from K-Swiss they will take a return but will deduct $5.00 unless you do an exchange. I'd exchange for a 12 wide but they don't have one listed on their site for this shoe, nor on this page as of this writing. Too bad, because I really liked them for 30 years."
5,All-time favorite!,"These K-Swiss Classic Luxury Edition shoes are my all-time favorite athletic shoe. VERY comfortable to wear everyday. My feet never get sore wearing them, even on long days with lots of standing and walking. Very good build quality and can last a few years with care. Cut is a little narrow, so keep that in mind for those with wider feet. These K-Swiss have a timeless look that never will go out of style!"
2,"cheap quality, appeared to be the same as the luxory classic","base of shoe was close to 1/2 "" narrower than luxory edition that I was attempting to replace. the luxory edition is no longer available in my size. the price is about the same. if you can find your size in the luxory edition get that one!"
4,inexpensive but very cute my son loved it,I thought it was very simple but it was exactly what my son wanted he loved it and that's all that matters I was happy to see him smile
2,Disappointing to say the least!,"What can I say? I have listened to this cd in its entirety four times (in headphones mind you) trying to identify some redeeming quality, but there is just nothing there to hang on to. The song writing is weak and lifeless. Nothing sticks in your head once the cd is finished. There is no melody or flow to these songs. I do believe this band has great talent, but the song writing must vastly improve to keep me interested. Comparing this band to The Beach Boys, or suggesting this recent work is a masterpiece is ridiculous. Sorry Blinkers. This cd made me feel like I was slipping into a coma."
4,Brush up Your Bible,"Good book to help you through stories in the Bible and to help you understand some words or phrases which aren't so common in our everyday vocabulary. Michael Macrone does a good job at keeping you enertained during the stories, which help us recall them better. No bibical giant should be without this book in his/her arsenal... great resource to help you out on that talk you my be called on to give."
3,Note the Track Listings Here Are Wrong,These are the track listings for the soundtrack to the film The Promise (1979) with music by David Shire and starring Kathleen Quinlan and Stephen Collins.
5,Best Book on Chess Tactics Ever Written!!,"Chernev and Reinfeld's book is the best tool available to significantly improve one's chess ability. I first found it over 25 years ago and it revolutionized my game. It is the book I use as the basis for teaching young people how to play chess. The value of the book is hidden in the simple fact that each tactic is clearly explained and demonstrated. The reader then gets to play through a number of different situations to reinforce the specific tactic. Each chapter builds upon another. The book's strength is its simplicity and singular focus. To top off the book's brilliance, position # 263 shows the reader how Frank Marshall made the most brilliant move in the history of chess!! If you desire to greatly improve your chess playing ability--this is the book. If you are already quite proficient, this book will keep you fresh. No Chess ever written will equip you to win as will Winning Chess!!!"
5,An invaluable book for anyone wanting to understand chess.,"Even though my copy is old, yellowed, and has the pages falling out, I would not give it up for anything less than a new copy. It has brought me from, a sometimes winner, to the point where I have to find new players. The old ones are tired of loosing. A truely outstanding book for understanding the tactics and spirit of the game!!!"
5,Yep - best chess book I've ever read,"I agree with what seems to be the unanimous opinion: this is the best and most useful chess book I've ever read, and the one that did more to improve me game than any other book.So, if it unanimously loved that much by the chess-playing community, why is it out of print?"
2,Celtic Fire,"Britania is not the choicest posting for a Roman commander, yet that is where fate leads Lucius Acquila. Not only is he sent there by human order, but also by the ghost of his murdered brother. Somewhere among the wild pagans, the answers he seeks surely lie. The lynchpin to his quest is the beautiful slave queen Rhiannon, though he does not realize this for some time. They should be enemies, but are drawn together by something greater than blood, revenge, or politics. Fans of Morgan Llewlyn or Parke Godwin will find this very similiar to their writing. Though classed as paranormal, that is largely a misnomer. The murdered brother's spectre is not a dominant factor to the story."
4,Fired me up,"Well, this was a pretty good book. When I got it I had no idea what to expect. Having never read this author, I was iffy. When a book has more then one element, it has to be done perfectly for the correct balance between the elements. Not alot of authors can do that to the readers satisfaction. This being a paranormal romance I thought was very good. The romance was great and the paranormal was not so off base that you had to talk yourself into believing it. It was a nice mix that did wonderful things for the book. This was a really good story. I would recommend it for a nice relaxing read to get lost in. Very enjoyable."
3,Overlooked Elvis,"Somewhat overlooked in the early portion of Elvis's career is this rather unique collection of songs. No classics here, but solid overall. 'Strict Time', 'Lover's Walk' and 'From a Whisper...' are favorites."
1,These fall apart in a flash and break right after that,"I really had high hopes for these little clamps. Unfortunately the pad caps fall right off and the racheting mechanism snaps off at first use. And I was only clamping fabric to cardboard. Very disappointing. I'm staying with Irwin. They have a much better product. Sorry Olympia, I gave you a try and you failed."
2,Puzzle review,"The tin itself is great and for the price I got it, it could not be beat. One of the puzzles was missing a piece and Hasbro did replace it but as this was a Disney puzzle, I would have liked a Disney puzzle to replace it, not Shrek 2."
4,Cute piece,"Very cute puzzle set. 100 pieces each, we received a Lion King and Sleeping Beauty set. The tin makes it worth it."
3,3-D does nothing for this game!,"The 3-d does nothing to enhance the game and actually makes gameplay more difficult.To really see the 3-d effects you must zoom way in, but then you see such a tiny piece of the map you must zoom all the way out. The camera is jumpy and the animations get jittery as you add more units.This is on a 3Ghz machine with 768 Megs of RAM and Serial ATA RAID drives!I ran right out and bought this game and played for several hours...it left me wanting to replay the original.Save your money play the original until this one to goes into the bargin bin."
1,stronghold 2,"The game is good. I think, Everytime that the game is played it will play for about 15-20 minutes and then shut down the whole computer. So beware what you get from people, because we can not even play this game."
3,Fan,"I loved the first Stronghold and the add on pack. It was simple to learn and more importantly it was fun. I purchased Stronghold 2 the day it was released. I had a lot of trouble loading it onto my computer, and I have tremendous slowdowns with the game. I don't have the very best computer, but it is new and in the upper end of systems as far as gaming goes. The game itself adds a few new things to the mix. I do like the fact that they give you a choice between a peaceful campaign or one that leans more toward battles. The game is a bit on the buggy side, so I would certainly say to head over to the publishers website to download the latest patch to get everything up to speed. This game could nose up to a 4 if they manage to correct all the problems."
2,Meh,I was really excited but it was a big let down to be honest.The editor was also a pain to use and combat was boring. I would not buy this.
4,"Fun, worth it, just a few bugs.","Ok, I love firefly studios, stragety games, and the Stronghold series. This is my favorite one despite that once in a while the game will start to freeze and what not. Once I get my new laptop im buying becuase iv scratched my old one and about three years later im coming back to this game. I recommend it but expect just a few bugs but really only in the war campaign. I didnt encounter any other ones..."
4,Good Entertainment,"I really enjoyed this game. I loved the realism of crime, rats and piles of waste to be cleaned up. The graphics were passable, and the landscapes were not boring. There are mountains, rivers and pits of pitch. Overall, it was really fun and I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Wasted my money,Never before have I bought a game where I truly felt I was ripped off. I bought the game even knowing some of the negative reviews. Actually I cannot write an accurate review because the game never loaded for me. It kept erroring out after 3 attempts at installing I gave up and felt robbed.
2,Do not Purchase this Game.,The Game was released way before it was finished. Even Patch 1.2 does not begin to cure all of its problems. Buy it anyway and you will be very unhappy. Great idea bad execution!I understand Patch 1.3 is now in the works. I would suggest you wait until it is available and then look for comments as to whether it actually does cure the many problems with this Game.
2,Makes you want to play the original instead.,At times it's hard to see the big picture of what's going on because everything seems so zoomed-in even when you zoom-out to max. The original stronghold presented the board so one could easily see everything going on.
1,Don't waste the time/money.,"The game is laggy, buggy, and not really worth your money/time. Even a fast machine will lag in multiplayer, and that's with only 2 players. The company behind the game, firefly, are so pathetic that they actually ask people to come to these sites and tell you guys how awesome the game is now. Well it's a lie. A patch has been available for days now but on their website it's still listed as ""delayed"". Just one example of their gross incompetence. Poorly made. Poorly supported. Money better spent elsewhere."
1,Don't fix what isn't broken,I have just returned this game for a refund. I was a huge fan of the previous versions and will continue to play them. They were easy to control and fun to fight. This new version is not worth the money. The gameplay is slow. The new additions to civilian affairs are tedious and time consuming. And frankly I was not impressed by the graphics. They were fun at first but they get in the way of playing a game. I will continue to play the original version until Age of Empires comes out later this year.
2,Incredibly Disappointed,"I loved Stronghold Crusader, it was great fun to play. I was looking forward to Stronghold 2 and read the negative reviews but I told myself that this can't be bad, its gotta be good. Wrong. Its buggy, loading takes forever, and is the enemy even playing. They either sit back and never attack or attack right away with 500 men. Normally though they just sit there, one of the funnest things about crusader was building up your castle and watching 500 enemy troops try to take it from you and fail.I heard they are making Stronghold: Legends. Hopefully it will be like the first two in the series, but I wouldn't know until the price drops to $20. Oh, by the way the 3d sucks and does nothing for this series. My advice, keep playing the first two and pray it gets better with Legends."
2,Five stars no where near,The people who have given this game 5 stars must be mad. Having played the original Stronghold and Stronghold crusader I have to say this game is rubbish. The first two were immensely enjoyable and excellent to play. Firefly have done this game no justice with its 3d effects and dodgy voices. How can you give a game 5 stars when it has so many bugs and problems. The characters never go where you want them to and the AI is pathetic. It mad me so angry I wrote to Firefly telling them if all the care about is fancy graphics then don't bother making any more games. Do yourself a favour and avoid this game like the plague.
5,Great Simulation,"In a few words absolutely fantastic game. Runs smoothly on my pc no problems whatsoever.It auto updated itself but beware if your pc is from that century (20th) this app may suck dryyour machine. It takes lots of resources though and beautifull graphics would demande ge forceof7 series card but it pays off. You will dive in the medieval atmosphere with beautifulmusic, detailed lush graphics, educational research tree, pigs noises around, birds singing likein countryside. Bought it used works like new.Disregard negative reviews. If you likeultimate castle sim look no further. 2k and Firefly did very nice job as with all their titles."
4,Great family movie!,"This was a really cute movie that would be great for the entire family, even the male members. The cast is full of well known actors and actress's, and the movie has mystery, suspense, action and humor and it has a great message about pre judging others. You do not have to be an American Girl doll enthusiast to enjoy this movie."
4,Sweet and simple,"Coming from a 16-hear-old girl like myself, this review may be of little help to some people. But to tell my honest opinion, this movie is a good one. And when I say good, I mean it's good. It's clean, has a fun storyline, GREAT actors, cute moments...and altogether leaves you feeling satisfied. While boys and men may not find much they like about it, I would recommend giving it a try. Little girls, teenagers, and moms alike have all told me they loved it...so why wouldn't you? :)"
4,Very Nice,"I took my daughters to see this movie in the theater before buying the DVD. It is set during the Depression era. In the beginning of the movie the main character, Kit, is seen living in a big house with the perfect life. My first reaction to that was something along the lines of - ""Great, so everyone else around her is suffering through this depression and loosing their homes, etc., and her life is perfect."" Then her father lost his job and had to leave the family to look for work and everything changed. Kit had to start working very hard to help her mother make ends meet. They start a boarding house and the story goes on from there.The *only* issue I had with it is that one of the women that was staying with them had some outfits that were a little racy and acted a bit too sensual at times, but it wasn't over-the-top. That's why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. Overall a good movie and my daughters enjoy it."
5,"Kit Kitredge, An American Girl","This is the story of young Kit Kitridge, whose family is fairly well-to-do, but suddenly finds themselves in a financial crisis during the Great Depression. The father is forced to seek work in another city, while the family takes in boarders to help with expenses. It's a very true-to-life example of how life really was during the 1930s.This is a movie the whole family can enjoy together, and is a great ""learning"" film."
4,Surviving the Great Depression,"This was a great movie about a young girl living during The Great Depression (1930's). Kit is a young girl pursuing her own dreams even in a world which is becoming more and more hopeless as the Great Depression deepens. It's a great story of holding onto hope, acting as junior detectives and understanding the value of friends of family, no matter who they are."
5,heartwarming story,This is a must movie for everyone. My little 7 1/2 year old grandaughter loved the movie and asked if I could buy it in DVD. I pre-ordered it on Amazon and hope it is availble before Xmas. This was the greatest movie I had seen in a long time.
5,Great,This is a great DVD for any girl who is an American girl doll lover. My daughter has watched it over and over again.
5,Great movie,"I got this movie for my 7 year old. She has an american girl doll so since I've seen this movie a couple of years ago, I decided to get it for my little girl and she loved it! it is a great movie and it also teaches something about US history. Great movie!"
3,bad comedy at the end - I was disappointed,"We expected this film about Kit during big depression to be at least as good as other American girl movies. We were greatly disappointed - all people from my family including my 9 years old daughter. We were hoping that the movie would tell more or less a real story of the big depression - so similar to the great recession which we have now (2010). The beginning was good. It showed Kit's family and her friends experiencing the signs of depression and dealing with it. It showed the school and kids trying to aprehend what it is about.The plot of stealing the money and jewelry, the magician, monkey man and the librarian become such a farce that all the other aspects of movie are completely lost. This gives a very bad impression on the rest of the film. The bad comedy at the end spoils it all!"
3,Nice Solid Story,"My ""American Girl"" went to the theater with Grandma to watch this, so this was the first viewing I had. I liked it, not to sappy, strong charactures all around a good flick."
5,KIT KITTREDGE - ENTERTAINMENT THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL ENJOY,THIS SERIES IS SUCH A REFRESHING CHANGE FROM THE HYPED UP HOLLYWOOD MOVIES AND ANIMATIONS. THIS WAS A REAL HUMAN INTEREST STORY THAT ALL AGES CAN RELATE TO ESPECIALLY IN THESE TROUBLED ECONOMIC TIMES. I WAS AMAZED AND PLEASANTLY SUPRISED AT HOW MUCH MY SIX YEAR GRAND DAUGHTER UNDERSTOOD THE CONCEPT OF COMPASSION FOR OTHERS LESS FORTUNATE DURING THE DEPRESSION. A HISTORY LESSON FOR LITTLE ONES!!
3,I would have liked to see the movie too!,"Since this was for an adopt-a-family gift, I couldn't open it and watch it, as I would have loved to have seen it, but with the price so high, $16.00, I don't think I'll purchase one for myself!"
1,I got a blank DVD,"I really liked the Samantha and Felicity movies; Molly was so-so. I haven't seen the Kit Kittredge movie yet because I received a blank DVD to download from the Warner Brothers website. The information on the case said NOTHING about that. Nor did the amazon website. Even when I called amazon to find out why I got a blank DVD, the person I spoke to insisted a movie is indeed on the DVD shown on the amazon website because the description on the website referred to a language and a movie length.Unfortunately, my ""antique"" computer doesn't have a DVD drive. I do expect I'll thoroughly enjoy the movie when I finally see it.It was a gift so I've been told that I won't be charged a re-stocking fee when I return the blank DVD. I expect I'll hit the ceiling when I receive the identical set-up in return.Kit Kittredge - An American Girl"
4,Kit,"I liked this movie because it was centered on Cincinnati, OH. My family lived there during the depression. Very good lessons were taught about how to treat people."
2,Boring,"I don't think the acting was bad, but the story was just boring. I got it from big lots for three bucks. This will go in my I can't sleep, but I need to because I have to go to work pile. I think I finally cut this loose within the last half of an hour. I loved the Samantha movie. I have had the felicity one for years but I have yet to watch it."
2,Wouldn't watch it....ever....again,"Kit Kitterage was whiny and seeming a bit snotty. She overacted and just the way she looked at people in the movie was like ""I'm better than you."" She basically told the kid Sterling you have big ears which no one wants to hear. She just seemed like a brat and annoying how she was yelling at the guy at the news place. Abigall Breslin overacted and it wasn't a very good movie or a ""classic"" people make it out to be. Overall the movie was a flop."
5,If you like politics read this book,This is the true inside information on the nomination of Ike for President. Along the way learn about New York and the New York Young Republicans. A well written story. I feal like I know the man. May he rest in peace.
1,Wretched repair service.,"My DNE920 failed after about 30 hours of use. I paid to return it for a warranty exchange ($15). The exchange unit (supposedly fully re-manufactured and tested) turned off with the slightest bump - such as setting it (not dropping, setting) on a sofa or sliding it into my pocket. Not a skip - the unit would turn off and reboot. This time, Sony paid the shipping both ways. The second replacement unit seems to work OK, but the charging base arrived broken: the electrodes were broken off. As the broken-off pieces were not in the sealed bag, the base must have been broken when it was put in the bag. The repair center wants the entire package (player and all accessories) returned to exchange, yet again; another 10-day turnaround. My conclusion: the repair center is out of control. Don't depend on any repair service from Sony. If it breaks, kiss it goodbye.Oh, Yes: The sound quality is outstanding when it works. Especially with upgraded earphones. I listen to classical."
2,Not a good buy if you are going to use as a grill.,Not a good buy if you are going to use as a cooking surface.I bought Coleman Tripod Grill & Lantern Hanger for my mom to keep her coffee pot over the fire wile the cooking grate was in use. The tripod was really flimsy and none to stable. If you lifted the tripod to move or adjust it the legs would fall apart. The grill is held in place by one thin chain that swings. If what ever you put on the grill has some weight to it like an 8 cup coffee pot and it is not on center the thing starts to tip.We mostly used it as a hanger for the lantern.
2,Tripod pieces don't hold together securely,"I bought this with high hopes and when I got it I was excited to use it down at the lake and on my patio with my weber firepit. The problem is that it has pointed ends to dig into the dirt and secure the unit. I wish it was just flat pieces. The more difficult part of the Tripod is that each leg breaks down to three pieces that stay togethter with bungy cord running inside the tubing. Whenever you try to move the unit, the peices break up. A real pain. I think I will just superglue them together since I don't want/need it to break down to carry. If you don't plan on using for backpack camping, I would advise full peice tripods without the sharp ends that aren't needed. Otherwise, you'll need to figure out how to tighten up the bungy cord so it stays together. Watchout for the tubes getting hot and wearing down the bungy string that touches part of the tubing or just from the high heat. It will work for you but it is a bit flimsy IMHO."
5,the greatest thing ever,"Everybody should have one of these. There is no better way to grill, cooking over a wood fire, no charcoal, no lighter fluid. What better way to prepare a meal than sitting around a campfire?"
4,Great New Artist,"I bought this album purely on the recommendation of George Siegl who runs aorheaven.com, as he knows good music and he rated this highly. I am certainly glad I listened to him.If you imagine a blend of Matchbox 20, Goo Goo Dolls, Vonray with a dash of U2 then you have Dakona. They have great songs that are catchy as hell, and are just slightly different to alot of other bands around at present.Do yourself a favour and buy this album."
2,Ich verstehe nicht.,"This cookbook is not fully translated. There are ingredients and measurements that are nearly impossible for Americans to find or understand. Some recipes I tried did not even turn out right or if they did, it was a shame because they were terrible. This cookbook is good for reference and maybe comparisons with other recipes, but that is all."
2,I can find better recipes on the internet,this book is lacking in so many ways. my husband is half german (he grew up in germany) and this book does NOT have half of the things that he loves (which was why i bought it). i STRONGLY do not recommend this book!
1,Mandatory text,"Although I understand that this is a procedural text book and that it gives good instruction to those who administer the QRI tests, it is still the most redundant and monotonous text I have ever laid my hands on."
4,Great Assessment Tool,"If you are familiar at all with the Flynt & Cooter IRI, you will love the QRI-4. You have stories with pictures, and without pictures, and now you do not need to find words lists like ""San Diego Quick."" This books gives you everything you need. Why didn't I give it a 5 then? I wish they would have organized it better than they did."
2,Compact - A pocket Version?,The print quality is some of the best I have seen in any magazine. It focuses on the creative aspects of photography and does so well. However - it measures 7 inches by (just under) 8 1/2 inches which is not revealed anywhere on the description and surprisingly not mentioned in other reviews. It's small! If not for the ridiculous size I would give it 4 stars with out hesitation.
5,Great shots!,"This is a 'small' magazine in size but large in terms of inspiration. The photographs and the stories are not so much focused on technique but more on the artistic values and philosophy of photography. Each issue includes an interview with an artist as well as one or more sets of photographs. The publishers are deeply involved in photography and often contribute their own images. Like good art, the photographs show that good photographers can turn ordinary objects into interesting subjects. Hence, the inspirational value of the publication.In addition to 'standard' magazine fearures, the publishers often offer the ability to purchase limited edition prints like the current offer for some of Bradford Washburn's mountain photographs."
5,Like Visiting A Gallery On Paper in my Leisure Time!,"I'm not a techy camera person, but I do appreciate quality b&w photography and the creativity of active photographers. Lenswork magazine highlights quality work and provides interview info on the artists. It's like attending gallery openings! I enjoy it, and the format lets me experience the photographs myself. It's a well-done, intelligent publication. Worth the price!"
5,Quate Tuam Togam!!!,"Having passed the first 2 years of Latin (failing the third miserably), AND having married a Latin teacher, you have to admit there IS a certain IRONY to that...and that's where Henry beard comes in...His impeccable tongue-in-cheek manner of illustarting how Latin has been (and can be) used in our language is not only one of the best learning tools I have encountered, but also one of the most humorous!He leaves no stone unturned in his pusuit to avail us of just how ""commonplace"" a ""dead"" language can be in everyday conversation.He covers things such as sports, great books, snappy comebacks, and even a letter to Santa...!!!He's like the George Carlin of ancient Rome...only without the blue language, (imho)...this is informative AND hilarious at the same time!A must read..even if you never studied Latin (or failed it like I did)!"
1,Just a repeat of things already done in his other book,"About 90 % of this book is the very same identical entries that were in his first book, ""Latin of all Occasions""Unless you are a Latin scholar or a linquist, this is not the book for you, don't waste your time or money. I got a copy from the library and did not buy it"
3,Great for e-mail signatures!,"As a whole, the book is mildly amusing. But it is full of great material to use at the bottom of e-mail signatures. Impress your friends! *Age . . . Fac ut gaudeam*."
4,True Performer,"This machine is a beast. My favorite feature is the digital height positioning system. The feed adjustment has good range. The motor is plenty powerful. It holds tolerances from one side to the other. I have run hundreds of Custom interior and exterior doors through this machine. My only gripe is the belt alighnment mechanism. When you are changing from different grits of belts, if you not right on top of the adjuster, it can get away from you and shred a expensive sanding belt."
2,Different Writing Style,"BUNDLE OF JOY begins like an old folk tale. That nearly lost my interest right there. I continued reading, but I never did develop an interest in this. It's told, as I said, like an old folk tale more so than a novel."
4,Bundle of Joy,Great read. I was impressed. If you are looking for a cute romance with laughs then this is a book to read.
3,Bundle of joy review,"I read this and enjoyed it, but did not like the fact that they put excerpts of a lot of other books, teasing you to buy them."
3,Filled with flaws but still invaluable,"The hostility here is quite overwhelming. The object isn't to always agree with a critic it is to yield insight from him or her. The main problem with this book is that Maltin has all these editors working with him and they obviously write a great deal of the reviews. Since none of the reviews are credited all we're left with is a false homogenity of opinion that has no consistency. My personal favorite gaffe is Coppola's 'The Godfather' possibly the greatest American film getting 3 1/2 stars while De Palma's 'The Untouchables' an enjoyable, tongue-in-cheek pastiche and nothing more, getting 4!"
1,Inaccurate information and dismissive attitude,"I can only speak for my own work, but in my movie, he not only got the plot and character names wrong - he missed the point. It was a historical fiction and he apparantly thought it was a true story. He didn't like it and blamed the pedestrian script, which (I must confess) I wrote. That's his perogative but there are no balancing references. The review could have mentioned the awards the movie won. (The pedestrian script by the way was nominated for a Cable Ace and was strongly reviewed in People, USA Today, the LATIMES, Variety and the Hollywood Reporter. I strongly suspect that Mr. Matlin didn't actually watch the movie. He just didn't like the subject matter. And so this makes him a great reference?"
4,Overall very good,"Leonard Maltin is a good movie critic. He may be off on some films (eg- Shawshank Redemption, Taxi Driver, Usual Suspects) and may not take the time to understand or appreciate some eccentric cult gems (eg- Four Rooms, Badlands), but c'mon he's reviewing thousands of movies. I'd say 85% of his picks are right on even though I disagree with him on some basic movie preferences (eg- French Films, Spielberg, Terrance Malick... all of his films deserve four stars). Maltin knows what's good (eg- Cuckoo's nest, Raging Bull, Deerhunter, Third Man, Citizen Kane) and what's hyped up garbage, not counting Spielberg (eg- Forrest Gump, Unforgiven). If you want someone to agree with you on all points, have a kid and stop bitching. If you want a good overall guide for picking movies, this is a book to buy. I just have one message for Mr. Maltin... Stop pointing out to us that and ending can negate and entire film (eg- Usual Suspects, Jacob's Ladder), we all know and don't care."
2,OK reference book,"While this has more films than the other guides, and often some great trivia about them, Maltin's guide has an almost useless index (missing many stars--Dean Martin, for example). In addition, he often shows his lack of knowledge outside of the world of cinema (read his review of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein & laugh politely at his ignorance). Otherwise, this is a handy little tool for the film enthusiast."
1,Critics are Meatballs,"Leonard Maltin is clueless, as is almost all film critics. Critics like Maltin were nerds that never had a date because they were too busy stuffing their opinion at people. In his observation of Meatballs, he can't even use his own words. He had to steal from the ideas of Tom Koegh. Get a life Leonard and a sense of humor!!! It would be great if you critics would enjoy a movie for what it is ""entertainment"" instead of analysing it as though it were a mathematical equation."
1,He gave GOODFELLAS a rating of only ***1/2.,"GOODFELLAS is one of the best movies ever made, bar none. The movie deserves **** and so does TAXI DRIVER which he only gave **! How in the world can he not rate both movies at ****? For the true movie buff, this book should be avioded."
1,BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD!,BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. BAD BAD BAD BAD
1,"Is this guy a putz, or what?","This guy's opinions are for people who don't have much depth of emotion. Otherwise, he's right on the money. Try Roger Ebert, instead."
1,ignorant and pretentious,"almost any film that cannot be considered ""family entertainment"" and is not from the golden era of hollywood is ignorantly dismissed as trash by leonard maltin. the scorsase classic ""taxi driver"" being rated so low simply on content is just simply blasphemy. leonard maltin shouldnt be allowed in the spotlight to the extent where his reviews will be influential on the public, for if he deserves to be a ""film critic"" then paulie shore should be in the same proffession seeing that he would bring across just about the same amount of intelligence in his reviews WITHOUT being pretentious. Maltin has no love for film as is clearly shown even with siskel and ebert, he is instead a critic that only rates movies as a vehicle to boast his on pseudo intelligence. Go get a book by someone that atleast understands the nature of expression in film unlike mr Maltin."
1,Horrible Book From a Horrible Critic,"Leonard Maltin has many problems. At imdb.com he gave Taxi Driver ** out of ****. This is one of the best films of all time. He also gave low reviews to such great films as Pleasantville, Peggy Sue Got Married, and The Ice Storm. It is easy to see why he is not esteemed as highly as the geniuses Siskel and Ebert and Joel Siegal."
1,WHAT A MORON!!!!,"Am I the only person on the planet that thinks Leonard Maltin's reviews are terrible? It seems he takes movies that the public loves and trashes them and takes movies that the public cannot stand, or just do not care or know about, and heaps praise after praise upon them. I feel like I could write much better reviews than this. Maybe I should. Maybe then the insanity will stop and worthless movies will stop being praised and movies that deserve that praise will finally receive it."
1,Maltin's rates movies according to the flip of a coin,"My mom met Maltin at a book signing once (a long time ago) and he tried to seduce her (I won't get into that!) But while he was trying to woo her favor, he bragged that he rates movies by flipping a coin. Imagine that! He also said that he bases his reviews on the backs of video box covers. What a jerk! I'm glad he didn't turn out to be my Dad."
1,horrable,ah purpley or whatever youre name is you have no idea what you are talking about.you talk about using the cap lock LOOK AT YOU. i read this book well i read it for about a minute. he can sit at home listening to his classics while we live in the real world. He hated movies that clearly as stated before by smarter people he and his low life helpers never saw.
1,He gives me milk when I want vodka,"Safe. Unimaginative. Pedestrian. Conformist. Boring. Spielberg fan.That's it, I'm out of insults to throw at this book.And to think people take it seriously!"
1,Terrible,"Leonard Maltin has the idea that, if a movie doesn't win a few oscars then it is terrible. And some time that isn't enough. The only advice I can give you is not to get this ""guide"" which is more like a book that makes fun of movies."
2,Memo to Leonard: Get a life.,"Stop, Listen, and learn, all of you snobs who think Maltin is God or something. Maltin is another critic who believes evey movie should be ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane."" You know what, not every movie is that good. In addition, what confounds me more, is the contradictive reviews in this guide. Go to the IMDB, it's a lot better."
1,It's a shame there's no BOMB rating here!,"Does Mr. Maltin actually enjoy watching films, I see little evidence of it here. The reviews are far too short and written in a totally negative style to provide a fair and honest review of any film. Riddled with factual errors the reviews nit pick constantly at obsure. The sort of material that gives critics a bad name. Not worth a penny of anyone's money!"
4,The Compleat Guide to Movies on Video,"I buy this book every three or four years or so, mostly to keep up with the new releases. The reviews are among the most even-handed available and while I have personal film faves Leo might pan, hey, that's what makes a horse race, eh? My only quibbles would be: (1) no reviews of multipart series such as I, Claudius or really long form films like The Stand; and (2) this could really be broken into two books by this time: a book that is pretty much set, cause the films are quite old plus a book that keeps getting updated."
1,"In-depth reviews of movies, providing you know the title.","Although the reviews are descriptive and, in some cases, even accurate, it is impossible to find the title of a movie based on any of the cast members. Nor is it possible to read about a movie based on the number of ""stars"" he feels it deserves. In other words there are no indexes, and therefore I'm returning this book."
2,Have it as a movie index,"I read the book to get some ideas before renting movies but I DON'T CARE what Maltins said.Think a bout this,when was the last time you agreed with critic?"
5,Seriously,Simply the best comprehensive guide of its kind. A critic with taste who doesn't pander to the masses and pop culture.
1,This Guy Doesn't Know What He Is Talking About!,"After reading his review on Transformers The Moive, I believe Leonard Maltin was never a kid. I believe that his reviews are biased! If Leonard does not like a movie then he rates it bad. An Example would be Transformers The Movie. He claims the movie is really nothing more than garbage. I think he never watched the whole freakin' movie to the end! This movie had a awesome story that anyone can like (from kids to adults). This is just one of many reviews I feel are bias'd. Warning! Stay away from this book!"
2,Perverse alphabetization,"After many years am giving up Maltin in despair at his continuing with his irritating, perverse and wholly idiosyncratic alphabetization. This ruins an otherwise acceptable book."
1,One Example,"Anyone who rates Eric the Viking as a ""BOMB"" is someone you want to stay far, far away from."
4,No Comments,"Although, Leonard Maltin has given many excellent and well-deserved ratings, he sometimes dissapoints me by giving a low rating for a very good film. Examples : Sophie's Choice, Forrest Gump and etc. Furthermore, what gets me more furious is that he keeps changing the ratings. For example, when Mel Gibson's Braveheart was released, he gave it a three star rating. the following year, when it won Best Picture, he changed it to a three and a half. The same happened when he first rated Earthquake. He gave it a one and a half. Nowadays, he changed it to a BOMB. Neglecting these flaws, the book is a gem."
3,This book is adequate but nothing special,"Maltin's book gives much of the essential info about the films. (Directors, actors, rating, running time, etc.) But the reviews can be all over the place. Maybe the star ratings should be given by polls of numerous viewers to help the reader get a wider range of opinion."
3,Where is Claude Rains?,"This is a great book, but how could he leave out the filmography of Claude Rains of Casablanca, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and Invisible Man fame? I am baffled by this omission."
2,"Accurate information, strange ratings","I couldn't find many errors as far as the whos and whats of a movie, but the ratings left me puzzled. Maltin is a big fan of camp, and readers should realize this before trusting the book. A really awful movie might get a half-decent rating because its ""so bad its good."""
3,a good start and sometimes insightful,"if you like obscure or offbeat cinema, it is a better than even chance that it is reviewed here. Availability of movie titles is top notch for a book; only internet searching gave me more information."
2,"A reference for the masses? Or, a mass reference?","Poor alphabetization - against all accepted rules and thus difficult to use. Ignores ""short"" yet important films such as: The Red Balloon, Frankenweenie, etc. Director and Star categories at end of book incomplete (Klaus Kinski?, Victor Buono? just two examples). Poorly done, really."
3,"Some good reviews,and others that completelly miss the mark.","This movie guide deserves some credit. For the most part, Leonard gives trash what it deserves. Unfortunately, Leonard is also stuck in 1937, and can't quite seem to accept the work of great modern filmmakers (like David Lynch). If you've seen his top ten movies list, you'll know what I'm talking about (""Singin' in the Rain""?!!...For God's sake, man!!) Most, or all, of his Top Ten faves don't date past 1950. THAT should tell you something. Still, sad to say, this is is far better than many others (like Ebert's). Videohound and Video Movie Guide (Martin/Porter), particularly Videohound, have more realistic reviews. Leonard, man, I think you were born about forty years too late."
1,I wish there was a 0 star rating...,"I've never liked Leonard Maltin's take on movies. I can live with Roger Ebert, but Gene Siskel I will miss, because at least he had some good thoughts about movies in general. Maltin is just an automotron from some distant planet who never REALLY watched a movie in his entire life. He's contradictory, and that really bugs me. I say go see a movie if you really want to see it, and don't listen to critics unless you are prepared to hear something you dont want to."
3,Unreliable ratings,"This book is invaluable for the facts it contains about movies -- actors, directors, times, etc. But it's ratings of these films are wildly unrealiable. 'Barb Wire' gets two stars; 'Blade Runner' gets one and a half. Maltin is obviously more sympathetic to mainstream American films than to independent or foreign films."
3,Maltin is Squeamish,"Leonard's great when it comes to classic movies or family fare, and I would recommend the book just for catching up on old movies you never saw. I've noticed he tends to deduct points from anything violent. For example, the last time I checked, he gave the movie ""Taxi Driver"" only one and a half stars!!!"
2,Pretty bad,"He gave the brilliant ""Taxi Driver"" two stars. He gave the insipid ""The Waterboy"" three stars. 'Nuff said."
3,Tax Lien Certificates: A Little Known Government Program That Can Make You Financially Independent,"The information in the book was useful. The condition of the book was disappointing. It was supposed to be new, but the cover was bent and there was pen marks inside. I will hesitate before purchasing from Amazon again."
3,WARNING! INTERESTING BUT OLD,"This is a little bit old in terms of tax liens, a venture that is dependent on making sure you have the most accurate info. I suggest reading The Beginner's Guide to Real Estate Tax Lien and Tax Deed Auctions, ISBN: 0978834607, a newer release."
4,A good start,"Yes, this is a very basic beginning to tax sales, but it really helped me to get a foot in the door. I used to know virtually nothing about tax sales, and this was the first book that I read. (I've been researching tax sales for quite a while now.) Regardless of how basic it is, I came away with the beginning of an understanding to tax sales. Some books throw you right into all of the complications and details of tax sales, but I think it's important to make sure you have the elementary concept of them in the first place.However, after this I read ""The 16 Percent Solution"" by Joel Markowitz and would recommend it to anyone who already has a basic knowledge of tax sales. Also, there's a website called www.taxsale.com that teaches you even more and also shows when and where tax sales take place in each jurisdiction of every state."
4,A good intro to the world of Tax Liens,"If you are new to the world of tax liens, this book will get you started.With tax liens you can earn 16% on average and up to 50% in some states, government guaranteed.Although banks are in the act (that should tell you how safe this investment really is) there NOT really that much competition for tax liens.Many people have heard about them, few are actually working the liens.This book is great as a primer, but you will need more information."
1,Painful to Read,"I couldn't get through this. The fourth time I read ""you gotta do this!"" I felt my time was better spent reading something without all the hype."
5,Simple Enjoyed,"I simply enjoyed the stories. They were funny at times, dealing with real life situations."
3,Oops!,"While the book was in pretty good shape,I was very disappointed that it did not have a dust cover, especially when the advertisment showed one. There were a few pencil marks but, that was to be expected."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was pleasantly surpised with this book. I was skeptical about reading this book, but it turned out to be a pretty good book. It held my interest from page one till the very end. I am glad that I took a chance and did not miss reading this book."
3,Waste,"I bought this book under the impression that the hero was a virgin. I didn't assume he was a virgin based upon the reviews from customers on amazon. But, from another website recommending this book. There were many reasons I did not like this book.List of Reasons:1. The hero, Lance, lost his virginity to older woman who is a woman of the night. For the simple reason he wouldn't be real man if he didn't lose it. That is really disgusting.2. The heroine is really bitchy to him.3. Also, she wants to become friends with the lady that Lance lost his virginity to. That is just really weird.When ever a author writes about how the hero lost his virginity to older woman and how they still remain friends really does rune the whole book to me. Other people may like this, but I'm not one of them. Do not buy this book if you want a virgin hero. Instead, read Untouched by Anna Campbell. It is up you if you want to read this book."
5,One of my favorite scents!!!,I absolutely love the smell of Macintosh. It brings out the fruity smell without being overwhelming. I enjoy burning it for long periods of time. I will continue to buy Yankee Candle.
3,A clever short film stretched too long,"I bought this film based on the other 5-star ratings here. Although it was good, I don't think it qualifies as a true 5-star classic.The core idea of the film--two producers who try their best to produce a flop but end up with a hit instead--is brilliant. Some of the scenes around that core, like finding the director, auditioning, and opening night, are golden.But the movie starts slowly. Zero and Gene's characters are fun to watch (especially with Zero's combover), but they can't hold our attention that long.One of the hallmarks of a great film is that you can watch it all the way through a second (or even a third) time. With this one, you spend most of the second viewing on fast forward."
2,Shelf life wasn't all that.,"I bought this to share with my adult children. My memory of the film, which I saw first run back when it was newly released, was far better than the actual movie seemed this time around.Funny how tastes change.Still, the last bit of the film and the Broadway play that results from the film's set up, is pretty funny."
3,Has Not Withstood the Test of Time,"Mel Brooks is one of the funniest filmmakers who has ever lived. That being said, his first venture into movie making while truly original, and no doubt groundbreaking when it was originally released, pales in comparison to his later works.The Producers centers around a failed Broadway producer and his paranoid accountant who discover that they can make more money by screwing their investors on a flop, rather than making a decent play. They purchase the most poorly written and offensive script that they can find, hire a manic director and terrible actors, and watch in horror as the play becomes a hit.This is worth getting if you are a Mel Brooks fan as it does have some amusing moments. However, if you are looking for Brooks at his best, pick up a copy of Spaceballs, Young Frankenstein, or Blazing Saddles."
4,I liked this one--funny!,"How could it not be funny, with both Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder in it!?The story line is about a washed up Broadway producer (Zero Mostel) who is persuaded by an airhead accountant (Gene Wilder) that he can make more money by staging a flop than with a winner, by subscribing more shares to his geriatric little-old-lady angels than the play could pay if it were a smash hit.Unfortunately, their guaranteed ""flop,"" ""Springtime for Hitler,"" well--you have probably guessed it...This one is pure entertainment..."
1,The Producers DVD,"Unable to view this DVD in Australia due to zoning restrictions. Maybe I missed it, but I cannot recall the advert providing this warning/information about zoning. I've purchased others without any problems. You win some - you lose some."
5,"""The Fruer Was A Great Dancer""","After seeing the Broadway show and now owning the movie I have come up with the opinon that the movie is actually better than the smash-hit Broadway show despite the fact it only contains two songs-- one of which was cut from the Broadway show. So if you expect it to be anything like the Broadway show your in for a rude awakening!In this Motzel and Widler give great performances along with the hippie who sings the song ""Flower Power"" at his audition and manages to get the role of Hitler in Bialy's ""Springtime For Hitler."" The jokes in this movie never fail to make me laugh along with the hilliarous ex-Nazi who is now a pigeon collector. There is not a bad scene in this movie and Wilder gives his best performance.The quality of the DVD is good and it's a movie I watch over and over again! If your a fan of good dialouge and old comedies this movie is at least worth a look at! All in all buy or rent this one!"
5,the gags are still funny,"The producers is a great show, staring a young Gene Wilder and an incredible Zero Mostel. The show is full of the zany song and dance numbers that are to be expected in a piece such as this. Non the less it is still funny today as it was when it was first made.The story is thus: A small time producer (Zero) wants to get rich, his accountant (Gene) decides the best way to do this is to make a huge flop and pocket the cost of the money. After all the IRS would never look at a flop, only a sucess.Unfortunately the two decide on getting the worste of the worste and the baddest of the bad to star, write , and perform in the play. The result, the smash hit Spring time for Hitler in Germany.The irrelevance of the song and dance numbers will make you laugh. Watch out for the Cameo by Mel Brooks when he screams on stage,"" Don't be a smarty. Come on join the Nazi party!!""(...)"
4,Funny and belly-aching...,"Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), an accountant, visits Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), former big shot theater producer, to review Max's book keeping. This leads to the two of them building up a huge scam, which involves a play that will for sure flop. The chose the musical Springtime for Hitler, which was written by a Nazi sympathizer. In addition, the cast must not be able to perform this horrid musical. Producers is a hysterical comedy that offers a wonderful cinematic experience."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The Producers features one absolutely hilarious, brilliant sequence (Springtime for Hitler) surrounded by far less amusing and severely dated material; the strength of that one scene is just enough to recommend it, but it's not a great movie."
5,"The Producers ""Produce""","Wonderful, funny, enjoyable color film with outstanding performances by Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder. Leaves you laughing out loud. Terrific film !"
5,One of the best comedies ever made.,"My father, a CPA, never watched a movie without falling asleep, and never laughed at a single comedy in his life. However, when I rented the PRODECERS, he fell on the floor with howling until his ribs ached. What more can I say except what FOOL studio is refusing to re-release this CLASSIC??? We need some good pirates if they are so stupid,"
4,"review of ""the producers""",The product ordered from Amazon came in perfect condition in a short time period. A great purchase. The movie itself is one of the best movies from the Mel Brooks collection. I also got the silver streak and young frankenstein.
1,5 Previews? No way I'll buy this one.,"Hearty THANKS to 'J. Wardell's' warning about the forced 5 previews before this otherwise fantastic movie! The Producers is great but I will pass on buying this one and it's gone from my wishlist now!I absolutely despise being FORCED to sit through useless previews of hack-job garbage just to watch my purchased movie. That's the whole reason we buy dvds here: We were not, are NOT, and will not be interested in Hollywierd's opinion is of what trendy drek we should watch. (And when was the last time they made a decent movie?... yeah, that's why we're all here buying OLD dvds.)The movie gets a 4.The forced previews get a minus infinity on ANY dvd."
2,Underwhelming and not very funny at all.,"I was so disappointed in this movie! I must be the only person alive who doesn't think this is a gut-clenching comedy. I've been hearing about it for years, and know that the Broadway version is a big hit. I think I chuckled a few times while watching this, but overall I don't think it is worthy of all of the top ratings it has earned. Yes, the premise is funny. I don't have a problem with off-color humor (I loved ""Blazing Saddles"") so that wasn't the issue. The concept and general story idea is hilarious. It just wasn't that amusing. Oh well!"
1,coca,I got this movie and it's in the garbage now. I could not even watch half of it. The movie is much better than the play. I can't believe it got any stars.
4,Mel Brooks at his very Best!,This movie is Mel Brooks at his very best. Gene Wilder is Mel Brooks on screen alter ego for this classic tale about a get rich quick scheme that goes hilariously wrong. Two producers think they have realize you can make more money with a Broadway Bomb than a Mild Hit. So they intentional try to ruin there own show. Much to there suprise the show becomes a comic hit.
1,The Schtick don't stick,"After watching this film, it seems quite obvious this was Mel Brooks's first film. The playing out of the gags, the directing, the progression of the film, it all just didn't feel quite on the mark for Brooks. Sure, it's without a doubt his style, but a whole lot of it isn't funny. Springtime for Hitler is hilarious, sure. Their solution to their dilemma, funny. A Hitler-obsessed writer. It's all there. It simply lacked execution. It's as if the soul was taken out of the flamboiant gags and left us with a shell of what might have been. A good movie that could have been better, at least the first sixty minutes."
1,Why Is This Movie So Popular?,"The Borders review has this line:""Hinging on a crafty plot premise...""Well, that's it. The movie rides soley on the audacity of the concept, making more money on a bombing show than a succesful one? A show that is - gasp - a musical, about HITLER!? Oh ho ho ho!Sigh.I hear the broadway musical is infinitely better, but this movie just sucks. Mel Brooks has much better fare in his other works."
1,Very borring movie - not what I expected to see,I was expected to see a musical and comedy but what a dissapointment I had when I watched it. It is not a musical at all. The movie has great actors but the story was too borring. I love comedy and specially musicals but this movie doesn't fall under any of these categories. I doubt I will ever watch this movie again or even recommend it to anyone regardless of their taste in movies.
2,An ok film that would of been funny if I would of watched in the 70's,Mel Brooks first film is a disapointment compared to Young Frankonstine and other films. I thought this movie was going to be a musical but it's not there are only 3 songs in the whole movie. I liked the Spring Time For Hitler parts but that's it. The film is way to 70's and if I was born in the 70's and would of watched it I would of probobly liekd it. There are a few laughs in the film. The remake comes out in Decemebr 2005 and looks better then this one.
1,Outdated and Stupid,"When watching movies, I usually don't think about turning them off. If they suck, I figure I can finish them and reflect on what went wrong. Or heck, maybe they'll end up having funny moments and have a small amount of redemption value. Instead, this movie turned out being the biggest bucket of .... I've ever seen. The humor is just too old. Within the first couple minutes the audience is treated to seeing a fat guy fall on a table. Boo, Mel Brooks, boo. The entire Springtime for Hitler thing is a great idea, but come on, it's no longer the 1960's, so the initial shock value it received is lost on an audience that can hopefully hear a song about Hitler without laughing its retarded socks off. While everybody else seems to adore this hunk of garbage, I must disagree. Unless you come from a time when comedy wasn't invented yet, do not see this."
4,Meshugana Mel,"The Producers is classic Mel Brooks- combination of neurotic Gene Wilder and down and out Zero Mostel will keep you in hysterics. Funny performances by Kenneth Mars, Dick Shawn, and Lee Meredith. Finally on VHS after all these years-the birth of Mel Brooks insanity."
5,Funniest Movie Ever,"The Producers is, quite simply, the funniest movie ever made. When I first saw it in a movie theatre MANY years ago, I laughed so hard during ""Springtime for Hitler"" that I fell out of my seat and rolled down a few stairs of the balcony. It is funnier than the Broadway play, a greater success, especially because of the cast -- Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are incomparable, not to mention Kenneth Mars and the rest. It's great to have it on DVD -- it will last a long, long time and give me many years of viewing hysteria."
3,Received used perfume,"Miracle So Magic is great, 5 stars for the fragrance. However, the cellophane was previously opened on the bottom and taped with Scotch. When I pressed the pump, the perfume came out immediately. With new perfumes it takes several times to press the pump before the first spray. I ordered directly from Amazon (not Marketplace seller) and was disappointed that the perfume I received was previously used."
3,OK - not great,"This perfume is OK. Its nothing like the original Miracle perfume. Miracle is amazing perfume and So Magic is just ""OK""."
5,"robert schumann, piano concerto in A minor, richter, s.,pian","I haven't heard your recording, so I cannot rate it,However, I heard a recording abour 40 yearsa ago. It is,undoubted one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever composed. Sviatoslave Richter is superb!!!"
3,Category of it's own,"Captain sensible is inspired in his own english pop world.Happy,funny,absurd,ironic and melodic songs.Some are good some are bad,but still essential for the 80's.Listen to the sublime and divine""Glad It's all over""over and over again."
4,Horizons Wireless HZ1500 LAN Card Review,Range is not significantly better than my previous Linksys USB Wireless - speed is somewhat faster. The range is certainly not over 10 times other systems (don't believe the fantastic claims in the ads).
3,not 802.11 b/g,"was let to think that this was 802.11b/g, but it is only 802.11b, which limits speed to 11 Mbs, not exactly the speed I was looking for. Also, the software isn't seamless, you have to run the software, and pick the connection you want each and every time, adds to startup time. I could have done better...."
3,"good, but not enough","First of all,the cd with the drivers didn't work.When i downloaded the drivers from there website, it gave me an amateur impression.The product though does what they say, if you can get connect to the network first. You can get connected if you are in normal paramaters ( first 100 meters). if you move then, no problem, you can internet, but you can't connect if you get disconnected.Maybe the product does more with there router, but I doubt it.I don't want to return the item because they do what they say, you get a longer range, and that's all about that, but if you can choose for a repeater of the signal or this product, then i suggest an repeater.If the price was a bit lower, then i really suggest this product, but it isn't worth the amount of moneyJust my two cents."
2,"Hardware good, software not ready for prime time","After about 5 hours of work with the installation software, I find these problems:1) A user must have Windows ADMIN RIGHTS to use the network connection. This is a problem in a house with kids, or similar situations. I've confirmed this limitation with their tech support, and will be returning the product because of this.2) The software doesn't load and recognize the connection automatically. You have to click on the icon to get it going, rather than making startup seamless.Seems to be great hardware, but the firm is small compared to vendors like Cisco, so it seems software development may not be up to par."
3,Buffalo Palace,Terry Johnson is not a great writer by any means but if you have an interest in the era of the far west fur trade and the west itself you will enjoy the setting and historical detail.
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this 2Gb EP Memory Mini Flash instead of a Kingston (A Brand which I've always been 100% satisfied with) because of the advertised speeds at the EP Memory Web Site. Boy, was I fooled. The EP Memory was 3 TIMES SLOWER than the Kingston USB 2.0 Data Traveler! It wasn't anywhere near their advertised speeds...The only good thing about the EP Memory is that it has an LED lite to show its in use...Thats nice but really not needed if watching the monitor for use. I also have a VIKING Interworks USB 2.0 that ran over 9 times faster than EP Memory.....I'd never buy another EP Memory USB again....Even if it's Free after rebate....."
5,Robert Levin rocks Bach,"I own Robert Levin's ""Well-Tempered Clavier"" and was supremely impressed. I go back to it often; perhaps moreso than the 4 other versions I own. I figured he couldn't go wrong with Bach, so I bought his ""English Suites"" and was proven right. His playing is superb and the recording is crystal clear. I highly recommend this CD."
3,I'm pleased with my product!,I only paid $10 for the textbook because it was listed as an average purchase. I got my item and realized that it was in better condition than was expected. Thanks!!
2,"HILARIOUS first time, STUPID second time","DO NOT BUT THIS MOVIE. I would reccomend renting from a movie store and get the one time laughs and then never watch it again. The first time I viewed this film I laughed my pants off and almost peed them do to some of the brilliant animation. BUT.... Even before I saw it the second time I was tired of it. I had no desire to see it again. The jokes will be outdated and by the time my generation starts being parents our kids will be like ""who was sir justin"". Rent it, dont buy it."
1,boring. Not funny or entertaining,"Puss in Boots was the only thing that made the movie worth watching. Without him, I would have given up on the movie before I finished it. His hairball attack as he was about to kill Shrek is hysterical. Not one other laugh either before or after that though. I kept asking myself why I was watching this.Fairy Godmother is evil and stupid, Prince Charming is way to annoying. The evil step sister was a transvestite. On the way to Far, Far Away, Donkey kept asking ""Are we there yet,"" to the point is was aggrevating, not funny.Thank goodness I only rented it and didn't waste my money buying a movie I will never watch again. I was so disappointed, I didn't even watch the other features offered....ie: ""Idol"" or goofs, etc.Rent before you buy and see if you like it first."
1,Hideous vulgarity,"This movie is just as bad as the first one - the quick cutting is ruinous for one's concentration, the music is dreadful, the banter and script is vulgar beyond comprehension. All mixed up with dreadful sentimentality - If this is what America likes , then the country is really screwed up...."
1,Shrek 2 not for children,"Parents! Parental warning: There are transvestites, sexual humor, and Pinocchio wearing women's thong underwear. If you don't mind your kids seeing the above than you could consider this a four star movie. Humor on the level of many Simpsons episodes.To be fair, the computer animation was wonderful in this sequel. I enjoyed this movie, but was embarrassed to have my children see some sections of the film. Any animated/computer animated film that will obviously draw in a large audience of children should be a little more considerate of the age groups that will watch it."
3,Great sequel.,Great follow up to the original film finds our heroes in another dilemma and in more trouble than they thought that they would get when they meet the in-laws. The entire cast is back for another worthy entry in this fine and funny series. Worthy enough for another sequel.
3,"Not bad, but Shrek 1 is better!","Shrek part 2 is a good movie. It improved on the use of CG technology compared to the first one. Also, Shrek 2 has its humorous moments, but the plot reminds me of day-time soap opera. Not that the plot is bad...I just don't think it was as great as others rate it. The fairy godmother (Disney) parody was overdone and not that original either. Shrek 1, IMHO, is still the best. As with the first Shrek, this movie's humor and theme are not really for kids. Overall, a good movie for family adults."
2,Promo prisoner,"I regret buying this dvd primarily for the fact that there are 2 movie previews (SharkTales and Madagascar) that the dvd WON'T allow you to skip or forward through!! Every time I want to watch this film, i have to sit thru 10 minutes of this! (Not great when my kids are sitting down to watch and are losing their patience waiting for the film) Had i known, i would have at least bought the VCR tape so that i COULD fastforward."
2,Huh?,"It seems like this DVD is missing a lot of stuff, and has some mistakes!First off, there is nothing inside the case but the DVD. Big dissappoint, since it makes it look good.Another thing is that you HAVE TO watch the commercials. Not aloud to skip + it's on the main menu trying to force you to see it.The biggest dissappointment is the movie itself. At the end, I asked myself, ""Is that it?"". Shrek 2 was cute, but that's it. Really the only thing you need to know is a cat joins Shrek. Wow, big changes! Oops, guess I spoiled the movie. Sorry! Wasn't that good anyway.Go get Garfield, Cinderella Story, Elf, or something cute to watch, because this DVD is boring and a waste of time."
3,Cute but not the Shrek I once loved. 3.6 stars.,"Shrek visits Fiona's home and runs into disaster after disaster. Her parents aren't the happiest that they're getting married, the Evil Witch of a ""Godmother"" tries to sabotage everything he stands for and even worse - tries to set Fiona up with the stunningly-gorgeous yet empty-souled blond prince which happens to be her son.It's got its laughs but it won't have you rolling like the first did and certainly isn't as original and fresh-feeling.I won't go out of my way to buy this and I'd rather not see it for another year or so!Cover Art: BStory: D+Dialogue: C+Comedic Value: C+Characters: A-Length: C3.6 stars.Overall: C+"
4,"Not quite as good as Shrek, but worth a look","Shrek 2 suffers from the same curse that has plagued most seguels, a lack of originality. However, this said, Shrek 2 is still fun to watch and worth the price of admission. The animation is first rate as expected, and there are some very funny jokes, and some funny new characters, especially Antonio Banderas as Puss N Boots. Anyone who loved the first movie should go see this worthy follow up."
5,Great movie,My kids love this movie!! Its such a good movie and I got it for a great deal! I got it right on time and didnt have any problems.
4,Really funny!,"In this sequel, Shrek and Princess visit her parents for a wedding ball. Her father is really unhappy with his son-in-law. There are some more people who are bent on breaking their marriage and marrying Princess, with an eye on the throne. Shrek and Donkey are just as funny as in the first movie. Loved the new character Puss In Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas). The graphics are better than ever (will there be any real actors in a decade?). The movie spoofs and digs in at every possible fairy tale and Hollywood movie. Very funny movie, I loved it."
2,LOUSY SEQUEL!,"The first Shrek I would give 5 stars!This sequel was so boring, I couldhardly stay awake! Saying this is the#1 comedy of all time is ridiculous!"
4,More Spoofs Per Second Than The First,"This sequel was loaded with chuckles and spoofs covering everything from Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills to COPS (KNIGHTS) to the giant Sta-Puff Man in Ghostbusters (only here, it's the giant Gingerbread Man). In a theatre filled with kids, it was the adults that were laughing the loudest. Not to say that there weren't chuckles for kids too, but it was definitely also geared toward the beer-belly laugh crowd.Shrek and Donkey's new cohort Puss N Boots is a real hoot as is Prince Charming. The animation and writing team on this movie must have had a great time working this one up.I might have given it 5 stars, but the guy sitting behind me was laughing so loud, that I frequently only caught the first part of a joke before he'd start laughing and overpower the audio. Go see it. Fun for kids AND adults."
3,Shrek is Great But 2 is not Necessarly The Charm,Shrek 1 is much better than the second. While Shrek 2 has some charm. For instance when Shrek first met his in-laws and the arguing that follows. Also Shrek in human form was great. If it wasn't for Donkey. This movie would be a bust. Donkey is first-rate in both films. His hilarious are we there yet is funny. Puss was also great played by Antonio Banderas was good. But stick with the first movie.
1,DVD is a disappointment,"This review is not about the movie itself, but the fact that all DVD player controls are disabled during the start and I'm forced to watch two terrible trailers for about ten minutes.This is unacceptable and I will try to return this DVD to the store where I bought it."
3,"The Swan, Shrek Style.","My husband and I were both excited about seeing Shrek 2 since we liked the first so much. Unfortunately, it was only as good as 3 stars; I couldn't help nodding during the first half of the movie. The last part of the movie saved it. It was funny and exciting. My advice--wait until it comes out on DVD unless you just want to take your kids to a movie."
4,good sequel,"Shrek 2 finds Shrek and Fiona settling into life in the swamp. When they are summond to Fiona's home of Far Far Away. The meeting with the parents did not go too well. Fiona was to marry prince charming, who is the son of Fiona's fairy Godmother. Fiona's father tries to have Shrek ""Knocked off"" by a hitman or hitcat in the form of Puss 'n Boots, who practially steals the movie. The movie is funny almost as good as the first. Like the first it pokes fun of pop culture such as Lord of the Rings and Hollywood. The animation and 3D modeling and rendering is more realistic than the first Shrek movie. I hear there are going to be two more sequels."
5,"Enjoyable, witty and funny","I greatly enjoyed Shrek 2. I think it is every bit as good as the original. Some new characters bring lively additions to the cast. The writers present excellent wit and humor for adults and kids, without any off-color 'adult' humor. This is a happy story and I think will have everyone laughing."
3,well...,"I thought the first one was okay, and if you like the first, you will like the 2nd. Problem with these jokes is that they are dated and old, so much of the humor is lost. Oh well, basically it's very predictable, and well you can see each joke coming even before they say it, so if you want to be surprised, see something else, but if you want a good family film, then by all means see this film, but I suggest that people wait to rent this."
4,Sequel Hater liked this one!,"Fun, new Shrek with witty dialogue, goofy takes on classic rock songs, and enough sight-jokes to drive you happily nuts. Added voices Antonio Banderas, Julie Andrews, & John Cleese join originals Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, & Eddie Murphy. Some of the animation lacked the TLC so visable in Shrek 1, but, over-all, Shrek 2 is a super-sequel."
2,Would Be Great Movie if it Weren't Making fun of Disney!,"If this movie wasn't making fun of Disney, I would happily give five stars. Disney movies are great, especially when Walt Disney was alive. The next Shrek movie better not make fun of Disney characters, because it's just horrible! Anyways, like I said, I would give it five stars if it WEREN'T MAKING FUN OF DISNEY CHARACTERS! P.S. I like Disney/Pixar movies better than Dreamworks."
2,Poor story,"I didn't like the original ""Shrek"" and don't like the sequel, either. To me, the fairytale is neither engaging nor funny -- I can't believe they bill this as one of the funnies movies ever."
5,Love it!,"I expected nothing more from this movie than a lame attempt at lenghtening great movie in order to make more money, but I was surprised by the quality of this movie! The story is not a repeat attempt at the original story but an actual continuation of the plot. It was definitely as funny, if not more, than the original. It's something you'd want with the first Shrek. It kept me laughing throughout the whole movie."
4,Just as fun as the first,"As far as sequels go, this one is a keeper. We watch it as much as the first Shrek. Another fun movie. I love all the characters."
1,"HORRIBLE DVD, yet great movie","I agree with the other reviewers who are highly annoyed with the DVD. You cannot skip the commercials at the beginning. That's 8-10 minutes of advertising every time you watch the DVD.Shame, hame DreamWorks for doing this. It is a major flaw in the DVD, and it is why I will never buy another DreamWorks product."
3,"SLICK, SHARP, AMUSING, BUT..","The first Shrek had immediately charmed me with its unexpected joy in the vagaries of an ogre's life, and in doing so, sustaining a compelling emotional tenor about how such a repulsive character can ever find true happiness. The resolution to that dilemma was surprising and gratifying.S2 loses a bit of that lustre by rehashing those pre-sold characters to put over obvious jokes. A couple of new characters may have been good, but we get half a dozen here. There is broad witty banter but nothing I'd remember for over a couple of hours. And when they stopped at a MacDonalds in space, that was it for me.One saving grace is probably a number of pop culture references. Particularly amusing was the Mission Impossible-inspired rescue of Shrek and company by Pinocchio, the three blind mice, and some assorted fairy tale regulars.Overall, a mild recommendation. Perhaps a decent rental, but nothing worth raving about."
1,Cannot Skip Commercials,"The story was ok -- not as good as the original.However, i strongly recommend that you do not purchase this DVD for the sole reason that it contains about 10 minutes of commercials at the beginning that you cannot skip -- at least not on my DVD player. This is simply inexcusable in any context."
3,"Great movie, annoying previews.","I loved this movie, but someone should tell Disney that the reason people buy DVDs is so that they can skip around. On this dang DVD you can't skip the previews! The skip buttons, menu buttons, etc don't work. They want you to sit through about 5 minutes of previews before you get to the main menu. This is why the original is staying in my closet, and a DVD-R copy (without those annoying previews) will be the one in my video collection."
3,Angry about Mandatory Ads,"The movie is fantastic -- funny -- just as good as the original! But try to find a DVD version that allows you access to the menu so that you can start the movie right away. When you purchase a DVD, you shouldn't be forced to watch the previews over and over. This DVD will not permit you to skip them. What's the point of buying a DVD,then? I know this isn't a review of the actual movie, but this really made me angry. It's a dirty trick by the manufacturer."
1,Is this what we can expect,"I was very dissapionted with the film, why is shrek naked throughout the film, this was quite disturbing to me, the plot was predictable to say the least and animals unbelivable, i will stick with films like the godfather from now on!!"
3,Ok... wait to see it on video though.,"Certainly as funny as the original... I didn't wet my pants, but there were a couple lines worthy of knee slapping. The flying goat character was hilarious! The belligerent monkey was pretty funny too... I think he was my favorite. I didn't particularly care for the racist donkey and his jokes about little people, but some people might find this kind of material funny. The animation was very good but I wish it would've been in an anime theme. Good soundtrack... I'm still tapping my toes to the Eddie Murphy's rendition of ""Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon""."
2,Who exactly is this movie made for?,"This movie shocked me. First of all, I didn't like the first one. Burping, farting and other crude behavior doesn't make me laugh. Secondly, why on earth would people choose to be ogres when they could be prince and princesses? I understand the point of the story, but why such extremes?Shrek 2 went beyond crude. Were my eyes playing tricks on me or was Pinochio in a pink G string? Was there a transvestite bartender? Was the cat licking himself provacatively? Not to mention a slue of other shockers that were completely unsuitable for a young audience.I realize the movie was rated PG. However when you put out an animated movie, all the children are going to want to see it. They are all marketed toward young children. There was no reason for a lot of the content in that movie. If you have little ones, skip this one."
2,"Four-and-a-half star movie, two star DVD presentation","I was shocked that after paying nearly $20 for this DVD that I will be forced to see a lengthy advertisement for a mediocre-looking movie called Madagascar, Every Time My Kids Want to Watch This Movie For All Time, even after ""Madagascar"" has been released and forgotten. Disabling the ability to skip this ad is just impolite of Dreamworks.Oh My Goodness. Avoiding ads is a primary reason for buying discs instead of watching broadcast TV. For that reason alone, this DVD will either get returned, or will ""dissapear"" from the kids-area of our collection.All that said, Shrek 2 is a fine sequel. Compared to the very swank DVD presentation of Shrek 1, however, this disc is a big dissapointment. Doubly so at its list price of $30!"
2,"Great movie, but what the is with the commercials?","They literally >LOCK< the option not allowed me to skip their stupid commercials. I paid money for this DVD, how dare they do that?!?! I am never going to buy a DVD from dreamworks again."
2,Disappointing,"Having enjoyed the first Shrek thoroughly, I eagerly anticipated the arrival of Shrek 2. However, where the first Shrek was funny and charming, Shrek 2 feels stale and tired. The jokes are the same this time around. The clever, clandestine pokes at Disney do not elicit the laughs they once did. The story seems a rehash of the plot from Shrek. It is as if the filmmakers felt they did not have to think of anything new or fresh and could merely reheat Shrek and serve it to the masses (which judging by the boffo box office, they were right). I would have rated this movie higher had the first one not been so utterly superior to this movie which, to its credit, does have some mildly amusing scenes. However, as long as Dreamworks is content to lampoon other people's work, Pixar's originals ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Toy Story"" will remain on top."
1,Bad version,This was a bootleg sent it back because it had a scratch on it after looking further I realized it was a boot leg version. The movie itself is a good movie but the one I purchased was not accurate in it's description.
4,a !Surprise all the times,"   The point was breaking the clichés in this movie however; I as 17-year-old teenager  appreciate its humor and soundtrack. The other point was how it constructed the  realism in the story where the magic really do not seems to be useful at the end,  although the directors may have only tried to show that, an ogre can also have a  happily ever after future and did not mean all of these  .    The soundtrack from my point of view was satisfying and the graphic where I could  guess what the characters where telling from their lips .    Overall, I rate this movie 4 star s. "
3,A fine movie,"Shrek 2 is a fine movie, but it doesn't live up to the first one. It was hard to live up to the charm of the original. The main characters are still as enjoyable as in the first movie. But the 'surprises' here aren't really surprising. And it's hard to root for or against the fairy godmother as a villain - she isn't as good a character as ""the prince who would be king"" from the original. The new character of Puss N Boots is good, but it isn't very believable that he is a 'hired gun' who easily caves in because?? I'm not sure why! I don't think kids will enjoy this movie as much as Shrek because it seems to be more of a straight love story. And the adults in the theater laughed at the jokes way more than the kids. I think because the kids didn't know a lot of the references. I enjoyed the movie, but the original Shrek is much better."
1,Never Again Dreamworks,"This DVD forces you to sit through two long, boring commercials before you can see the movie. Or rather, it forces me to fast-forward through them while my kids wait to see the movie. Or rather, I'm throwing this piece of junk away.I'll never buy another Dreamworks product."
3,Antonio is the only good part.,"Writing this review is probably pointless because who on the planet has not seen this movie at this point? At any rate, while better than the first Shrek movie, I found this movie pretty disappointing. I went solely for Antonio Banderas and he made it extremely worth my while!! Antonio rocks as Puss'n'Boots!! Cameron Diaz is horrible, Mike Myers is his usual post-Wayne's World annoying self, and Eddie Murphy has once again managed to stereotype African-Americans through the mouth of an animated donkey.Rent it. It's not worth your hard earned $16.00."
1,Shrek 2 - Wish I'd waited for the DVD,"""Well, it didn't totally stink."" That was my initial reaction after sitting throught Shrek 2. Were I still in middle school, I no doubt would have found it hilarious. But I am not and I did not.Don't get me wrong - there were some very funny bits sprinkled through, but they were not worth the price of admission (or the time it took out of my Memorial Day weekend)."
2,Waste of time,Shrek is perhaps the worst character ever brought to the silver screen. I hate that big stupid green ogre and his stupid ugly green ogre wife.
4,only one problem....,"... but i think this movie was geared more for the old ones rather than kids. one glaring example is the use of '80s pop songs (like bonnie tyler's ""holding out for a hero"")... like, will the kids born after the 80's appreciate this more than the old fogies watching it and ""getting"" it?other than that, its a great movie. worth buying a copy."
2,This sequel isn't sweet.,"Shrek 2 was such a disappointment. I loved Shrek and waited anxiously to see the sequel but I just couldn't get into this one at all. It's pretty slow and choppy, the plot this time around is pretty lame. I am sure Shrek the Third is dumb as well, keep away from this stinker!"
3,"A good sequel, but it lacks the charm of the original","I loved Shrek. In fact I cannot remember the last time I laughed so loudly at an animated film. It was so charming and so funny, I could not get enough of it. S2 is fine, but it seems to be pushing too much product and trying too hard to satirize the real world, that a lot of the original charm seems to be gone here.Myers is great and Murphy is still outrageously funny, but again the story does not allow them to play with as much whimsey as its predecessor. Banderas and Saunders are great additions to the mix and really seem to enjoy their characters.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this film, but I would have enjoyed it more if the original wasn't so darn charming. Definitely worth seeing - the animation is better than ever- but don't be surprised if you feel it lacks a little something."
4,Brilliant Shrek Sequel!!,"I saw this movie earlier today and I loved it!! This movie impressed me much more than the first with the animation, humor, characters (who can resist Antonio as Puss in Boots?) that have been added to the sequel. Shrek and Fiona look different for awhile in the movie...they both are human again after a potion that Shrek drinks. The plot was pretty predictable, but seeming them overcome the challenges was pretty interesting. The part at the end with the ""Livin Lavida Loca"" segment gave me a sideache from laughter! Overall, a fabulous movie-better than the first!"
3,This is extremely disapointing!,"While this movie is hilarious at almost no points, it's got so many mistakes! We could SO do without the bartender drag queen, and the fact that Pinochio wears ladies' underwear! That's so sick! And Shrek, and Princess Fiona should have stayed human, and Donkey should have stayed a stallion. The story goes well with the first one that's actually a lot better then this one. Once again, someone's trying to get Fiona to get married. But, it's really not that good."
3,Cute - But Not As Good As First One,"Get it used if you can, to save some money. It's a nice movie - but I think the first one had a better story behind it."
1,Great Movie / Terrible DVD,I'm extremely bothered by 'un-skippable' commercials (previews) at the beginning of this DVD. Why am I forced to watch these darn long previews every time I play this DVD without an option to skip over them? Too bad - a great movie and a terrible DVD.
3,"Alas, It doesn't hold up","Believe me, I wanted to love this sequel more than anyone and was moderately happy when I saw it in a theatre. But now that I've seen it over 50 times (I have children) I have to say that it 1) It really doesn't hold up next to original (which I must have seen over 200 times), but even on it's own 2) It feels pieced together, not an organic story, and the humor is often times obvious. Sorry!"
4,A good one of kids and adults...,"Slightly diffent story, same message. As always, great animation. Many jokes will appeal to adults and whiz over junior's head, but the movie is made for junior, so he won't mind. Most fun are the new characters. Who could resist Antonio Bandera's purr as Puss N' Boots? And, who couldn't love/hate that Fairy Godmother? (Anyone remember ""Absolutely Fabulous""? That's Jennifer Sunders' voice you hear.)"
4,BETTER THAN OTHERS,"WITHOUT MORE WORDS TO EXPLAIN THIS MOVIE YOU WILL BE WHEN BUY IT. INCOMPARABLE AND UNFORGETABLE WORK, FULL OF GOOD ACTORS AND SPECIAL EFFECTS. YOUR BEST CHOICE!!!"
2,Just Not Very Good At all,"I have no clue why people like this film. If you want a good animated film or something, buy Aladdin since that's coming out in a month or so. I'm serious, this movie is just not good."
4,shrek2,shrek2 was funnier then the first one but the first one had a better story but this was still a good movie haha mr puss was funny oh i cant wait for it when it comes out it will be a wonderful movie to get.
5,Very funny movie,"After watching the original Shrek, I was dissapointed and thought that it was a very average movie. So, of course, I wasn't that excited for this movie but for some reason, I thought that it was absolutely hilarious. The plot centers around Shrek and Fionna who travel with Donkey to the land of Far Far Away to get a bessing on their marriage from Fionna's parents. But they are horrified by the ogres and the father hires an assassin to kill Shrek and the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming try to seduce Fionna. It has loads of great laughs with Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers, and Antonia Banderas at their bests. At the end of the DVD, you're also in for a treat with the hilarious Far Far Away Idol, a spoof off American Idol with Simon. So watch this one if you want to laugh a lot. So there you have it."
3,Disappointing,"After high anticipation, I severely let down by this DVD. (...) The movie itself was also a let down. Fairy Godmother who was such a dislikeable character had way too large of a part and I did not care for her singing. A larger part for Puss in Boots would have added much more charm and character to the movie. There were a lot of good scenes that could have been enhanced to make this a much better movie! I wonder did small children understand the hypocracy of Fiona's father? Bottom line, I just didn't like it. I'll watch the 1st one again the next time I get a yearning to see Shrek."
1,completely stupid,"i don't like this movie. neither should you. all the adult jokes spoiled it for me. the plot is not original. you will believe what i write. you will fall into a deep sleep and then you will wake up and hate shrek because all things shrek bore me to sleep. thank you for reading this, and no, don't bother saying if it's helpful or not. the hypno-people thank you for bothering with this review."
2,Not Even Close,"This movie is not even close to the first one. Shrek was fresh and original, but this is formulaic and boring. The story line is predictable and annoying.It's an adequately (barely) entertaining movie, but the reason this might be worth renting is that the ""Far Far Away Idol"" extra was fun to watch. A take-off on American Idol with the characters of the movie, there were good choices of musical material and pretty good performances."
2,FUNNY BUT NEGATIVE,"There were many funny parts to the movie. Unfortunately, there is not a single strong male character in the movie. Even my young son noticed it. I know it is just a cartoon, but sheesh. Even Shrek comes off as a weakling, unlike the first Shrek."
5,My argument why this is better than the original,"Shrek One is more original in its creation of the Shrek universe, Shrek Two builds on the world. However, Shrek Two has better jokes, the characters are a little more fleshed out, the visual jokes are a little more adventurous. This is one of those rare situations that while the first was great, the sequel was even more entertaining. The DVD extras are pretty funny too. Check it out!"
4,Good but not as good as original,"i love shrek 2 all the jokes from:Mission ImpossibleSpider-manpeter panand a whole lot of others and if you don't like spoilers, then don't read this next thing.* The king is a toad* Shrek turns human and so does fiona and donkey is a stallionThis is a good movie but not as good as originalJeremy Sollie merdian,ms"
5,Works on several levels,"Sure, you can view this as a cartoon. But it's got watching levels for adults, as well as kids. You can appreciate the family satire, the send-up of Hollywood, the fast-moving jokey backgrounds where you see a Starbucks in the kingdom of Far Far Away etc etc. The dialogue is spiffy. This starts fast and moves faster so you don't have time to get bored with the fact that you are watching animation. The soundtrack is great, as has become the standard with the Shrek series. Highly recommended, and that's from someone not prone to enjoy this low-brow form of entertainment."
4,movie for the whole family,We got this for christmas for a family movie night since we all saw the first. This was a great movie. My daughters faviorte is the donkey
3,Bland,"The original Shrek was an innovative comedy whose gags appealed to both young and old. The follow-up acts like they could only find one joke or character that they hadn't used in the original, which was Puss in Boots. The best moments in the film center around this character however the remainder of the movie was bland. The sequel seemed as if it was rushed to the theatres and based its hope that film goers would just be happy to see the title characters again. With the box office sales to date, they guessed right, but as a fan of the first one, I was very disappointed."
3,I m old and i love it.,"I bought this for my uncle who happens to be younger then me. I watched it with him the first time then went out and got one for myself. The loveable cast of characters is back, again! Fiona Donkey and Shrek are off to see Fiona's parents IN WIDESCREEN!! the humor continues as a lil kitty comes in to the picture. I suggest you at least rent this movie because it is just that great"
1,"Good Movie, Previews SUCK","My kids hate watching this DVD because of the stupid preview they don't want to watch every single time.HINT: Most DVD players have a disk memory and will start a DVD where it was last stopped in play. When your done watching Shrek 2, and you are back on the menu, just hit play and let the movie start a few second then stop it. The next time you watch it, it should start from the beginning of the film where you stopped. If this doesn't work, just don't ever buy Dreamworks DVDs again!"
3,Not for younger kids!,"I took my kids to see this on the advice of my sister-in-law who worked at a theater at the time. She apparently forgot what was appropriate for younger kids. Though I enjoyed the movie, I was upset that my kids had seen it. They, of course, didn't get a lot of the jokes, but the content of the film wasn't as mild as the first Shrek. The Fairy Godmother was portrayed as an evil entity seeking gain for herself. The transvestite 'barmaid' raised some questions as did Pinocchio wearing a womens' red thong for underwear. Throughout the whole film, the parental characters were trying to undermine Fiona's marriage to Shrek, hoping that she would choose someone 'normal' looking (ie Prince Charming, who had no personality) as opposed to someone like Shrek, although she really loved him and was happy that way.Next time Dreamworks puts out an animated film, I'll not be so trusting that it'll be for my kids to see. I'll give that trust to Disney instead."
1,angry,I never got the order I am extremely mad I got an email sayin it was shipped but there was not tracking number it was suppose to come the 21 an still hav not arrived
3,It's missing something...,"I didn't enjoy II as much as I did Shrek. Can't quite put my finger on any big reason, more like a combination of small stuff. Seemed like the jokes went on too long, as if we wouldn't get em right off, and some were pretty inane. The film didn't hold my undivided attention like the first one did and there weren't as many full blown laugh attacks.If there is a III, we will rent it before we buy it. This one was a gift so no loss there.I don't think this is the stinker that some reviewer's have labeled it,but it is not as good as Shrek. Ok for a rainy day."
2,Sniff,"I did not get any jokes. Madagascar, and over the hedge look great, But this stinks, The only thing that saved it from 1* is that The 3 blind mice, If they had a biger role, It would be 4*'s......... COMPLETLY. Take my advice, Watch Garfield, The simpson, or Sponebob anything besides this."
5,I'm german,"Hallo, my name is Philipp Preißer and I'm from Germany.The Film Shrek 2 is the best film of the year and I love this film.Der Film übertrifft jedoch nie den ersten Teil!!!Ihr Philipp Preißer aus Deutschland"
1,Doesn't work,After recieving this product i tried playing it in my dvd player and it started up played about 5min. then it started skipping so bad that it doesn't even play. Not happy with this purchase and will not buy from these folks again
5,The best of the Shrek movies (up to the third one),"Of the three Shrek movies available, this one was, by far, the best. The humor is great along with the use of modern music. The romance between Shrek and Fiona is even better than the first one.Fairy Godmother, her operation and her son Charming are a great addition to the Shrek storyline. The team of Puss-in-Boots with Donkey is great. Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas really work great together.What I have enjoyed about all the Shrek movies is that pre-teen and older children can enjoy them. At the same time, parents, who grew up in the 1980's (like me), will find a number of references that they will enjoy even more than the children.Don't get me wrong, I like all the Shrek movie - even the third one that a lot of people don't seem to like. I just think this one is the best."
5,Grand kids favorite,"Geat movie, keeps kids entertained for hours, no profanity, sorry Eddie Murphy, you can do clean movies too!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"comically hillarious, action-packed and new characters","I was actually unsure about Shrek 2 because I was worried they'd ruin the first movie by throwing in irrelevant and painful gags with no real plot, but I was shushed into silence as I watched this hillarious and feel-good film. It's again a mickey-take of all the original fairytales like Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Pinochio, and Cinderella, but it's still so funny. Whilst this is for kids, it has some quite, let's say, controversial scenes which could upset young children. The parts where Shrek and Fiona need a little privarcy to make love is quite a scare for three-year-olds. And many people love Puss N Boots fairytale, yet in this they put him on drugs! But still, this is an excellent follow-up to the blockbuster hit Shrek. I would definitely give this one a see, it's just as good as the first one!"
4,Way Better Than the Original,"For starters I was not that enamored by the original ""Shrek"". I admired it's technichal attributes but found it's story a bit tiresome and it's joke's hit or miss. I went to the theatre twice to see it because everyone was telling me how great it was that I went back to see what I missed. When the sequel came out this Spring I did not rush out to see it. The only reason I saw the sequel is my brother gave it to me for Christmas. Needless to say, ""Shrek 2"" is a pleasant surprise. The story here is more compelling and the jokes, particularly the cultural references, are funnier. The additions of the voice contributions of John Cleese (King Harold), Antonio Banderas(Puss in Boots) and Jennifer Saunders(The Fairy Godmother) add to the improvement over the last ""Shrek"". The visuals here are more stunning and clever than the original. Let's just say that ""Shrek 2"" warmed up this ogre's heart."
4,Entertaining Animated movie,"I'll agree with those who say the first one was better. I saw this in the theaters, and watched the first Shrek on VHS. I'm not too big on ogre movies, just like the not-so-evil fairy godmother says, there are ""No Ogres"" in happy endings. But as a kids movie, it's enjoyable enough for the entire family to watch and it does have a lot of funny moments. The DVD has a lot of extras and some computer stuff for the kids. Like the first Shrek, it's obivous the characters are computer graphics, but they come as close to reality as you can get."
5,Amazing,This film was absolutely amazing. It is so comedic and brilliant. It outshines the first one by far. Antonio Banderas was fabulous as Puss-n-Boots. Definately a must see.
1,Ruined my experience. Thanks!,"I am extremely pissed off. I paid for the DVD to watch the movie, not the 5 to 8 minutes of marketing crap before you can watch the movie.I own a DVD player so I do not have to fast forward. I want to skip through material I do not wish to see. I will NEVER buy another Dreamworks DVD. I get enough of marketing material/spam in my email box. Last place I want it is in a DVD.Dreamworks wants to force me to watch marketing crap on DVD? No thanks. Bye Dreamworks. You lost a fan.Why am I bitchng? Why should it mattter to you? Well, if Dreamworks does it and no one complains. Then all DVDs will end up forcing you to watch what they want before you can watch what you paid for. Shrek 2 DVD would have been great, but it was ruined by Dreamworks marketing practice!Thanks for ruining Shrek 2 and possibly DVD Dreamworks! I will attempt to return the DVD today."
3,Kids will love it,This aninmated sequel is nearly as good as the origional.Kids will love it and parents will also find it entertaining.
4,Great!!!,"Although I liked the first film, I had doubts about this movie. How much new material can the writers adds to an old storyline? A lot, actually. Shrek 2 turns out to be almost as good as the original Shrek.This is NOT your typical Disney movie; it has an intelligent sense of humor and an unconventional view regarding love and romance. Fiona is torn by the apparent lack of welcome from her family. Ogre develops inferiority complex. Talking donkey gets a new rival. Fairy godmother is the evil bitch, and the owner of a magic factory, who is determined to see his son, Prince Charming, married to Princess Fiona.The main theme of this movie: is attractiveness possible without the physical beauty? Fiona and Orge struggle to find the answer.Go watch the movie. It's worth the bucks!"
4,Great...for a sequel,"One of the things that made the first Shrek movie so great was its originality and unexpected lampooning of other fairy tales/Disney movies. No sequel could possibly recapture the freshness or originality of this original.That being said, Shrek 2 thoroughly exceeded my expectations. The new characters (particularly Puss in Boots) were great, and the old characters maintained their edge (I was particularly worried that the Donkey character would start to wear on my nerves, but he did not). The story was good, and there were plenty of laugh-out-loud moments.All in all, Shrek 2 is nearly as good as the original (sans the novelty). Highly recommended!"
5,VERY VERY FUNNY,"This Shrek would have to be even more funnier than the first one, which I never thought possible.We just recently had the pleasure of viewing this whilst visiting from Australia. It was just superb, the colour, sound, story line etc etc was just so funny, we have never laughed so much. Much much better than the first one. We have come back to Australia totally singing the praises of Shrek 2.Cannot wait for the DVD to be released"
4,a different purpose,"We have a 25 year old profoundly retarded (and that's a perfectly good word!) son who loves things he can push and get music from. Normally I check to make sure that no matter how often he pushes a button -- and it is often repeatedly -- the tune will continue playing until done. But this little butterfly doesn't. If he pushes it once, the tune plays, and then pushes it again, it stops. At first he threw it down in disgust (it withstood that treatment beautifully) and then picked it up again and tried again. For him, it may well be educational as it may teach him to wait for the song to finish before pushing again. For Chris, that would be a major learning thing. We have a lovely little granddaughter of about a year old, however, who finds it boring already. All you do is push the button and lights and music come on, play, and stop. You push again and the same thing happens again. For Chris, this is great. For our granddaughter, she's already past it at a year."
2,YOU MUST KNOW THIS! Cute/ fun but the paint peels off,YOU MUST KNOW THIS! My 7 month old daughter got this in a family Christmas stocking recently. She likes this toy but within a few hours of having it the paint on the antenna of the butterfly began to peel/chip off (she has 6 teeth and may have bitten it off). I can not let her play with it anymore because of swallowing the hard paint chips... very disappointing because it is a cute toy.
2,after 10 seconds my son leaves it,"it plays different music, the bow tie is the only button. lights up to the music, and there is no volume, you can barely hear the music going unless you hold it to the ears."
1,Bad purchase,"This toy would benefit greatly from an on/off switch. My 9 mo old seems mildly entertained by it, but you can't turn it off, you can't put it away. I think I'm going to have to get rid of it."
5,AMAZING,Kelly Bruner is absolutely AMAZING! I have met Kelly many times and she is so talented. Her CD is a MUST BUY!!!!!!!!
2,Not worth the price,"While the construction is good, these banana plugs are only compression style, so you have to insert the wire from the side only and tighten the screw. The Dayton Audio banana plugs from PartsExpress are cheaper, at least as good and offer both side and rear entry. These PHOENIX GOLD plugs are not good value even at $5 a pair."
5,Maggie & Thomas are wonderful performers,"Maggie Carchrie and Thomas Leigh have performed for many years at the Glasgow Lands Scottish Festival in Westfield, MA... Each year they have gotten better and better and we are glad to see that they have released a CD. Their performances have always been very well received and attended. As Ru-Ra has been such a popular group at our Festival, we are having them back again in July, 2002. We highly recommend the album!!"
2,More a Manifesto for Agile Development than a tutorial...,"This book tries to cover too many things. The book is more a Manifesto for Agile Development from an experienced programmer than a technical book.Thus this small book misses all the details any technical person would like to see. The book is definitely not a comprehensive API guide to Spring or Hibernate, nor does it intend to be. The author repeatedly said : ""more to come later"" or ""we'll see this in later chapter"" etc. But that moment never arrived...The books can be used to get an overall idea for a manager or a programmer who is totally a newbie to the concepts.The more interesting part is on Agile Development where it seems to be a Manifesto but definitely not a tutorial."
1,Wasted 2 full days on this book,"It feels like a developer got his notes from his previous project and awkwardly put the together to create something that remotely reminds a book. There is nothing agile about this book but it does have a bit info on Spring, Hibernate and Eclipse. After reading this book you will be more confused about the subject than you were before."
1,This is a joke,This is nothing but an overview. The code is hard to follow since there is little or no code in the book. I felt that it was way to hard to get to the code on SAMS website. (Why do I have to register to obtain the code?). To really understand anything in this book you have to google a lot and buy other books.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
5,A must have for Java EE architects and Development Managers,"This is very good book ... if you do not pay too much attention to the title. This book is not a Spring or Hibernate tutorial. It presents an excellent overview of the development process in an enterprise Java shop. The author is an experienced practitioner, and this book is a jewel for any Java architect or a development manager. You'll learn how to set up the environment, how to gather business requirements and build the project deliverables agile way. The author explains where Spring, Hibernate, build and test tools fit by going through the process of development of a sample Java application. Here and there he sprinkles concise Java or XML code samples that are short enough to not get you carried away with details, but at the same time they help you to put all pieces of the puzzle called Java Enterprise Application in the right places.Yakov Fain,Java EE Editor of Java Developers Journal"
2,Need Sample Code and Other References to Understand,"There is some useful information in the book that describes the technologies and how they relate to each other. Not a bad way to get your toe wet if you have not worked with these before. But I never got a firm understanding on how the Spring framework actually worked until I read other material elsewhere. It would be nice if the application's class relationships and the processing sequences were presented in UML diagrams. That way one could really understand the composition of a Spring application and how the application's components interact with each other. You will be left on your own to go figure that out. And a lot of us travel on business and with this book lacking diagrams or complete code samples you can't just read the book on an airplane or elsewhere. You really need to work through the code, study other reference material, and figure all that out while you read the book."
2,May not be for programmers,"This book tries to combine so many things in to one. Thus it looses the detail any technical person would like to see. It skims over Extreme Programming, RUP without saying much about it - it is understood as it is not the focus of the book.The architecture it discusses is just a three layer one, which I believe any programmer would know before hand. This talks about lot of freewares and then it goes through Hibernate and Spring, which I believe is not enough for a technical person. The books can be used for overall idea for a manager or a programmer who is totally new to the concepts."
4,"Fast-paced, highly readable introduction to Open Source Enterprise Java","Anil Hemrajani is an old hand at Java and his experience speaks for itself on every page. This is one of the faster-paced introductions to Open Source Enterprise Java technologies that I've come across. Each chapter starts with a cartoon that highlights the relevant XP iteration - quite a cool concept. I like also the fact that the author cuts to the chase with practical advice and offers soup to nuts coverage on all the technologies necessary for pulling together any reasonably complex project. Readers can expect to get up to speed quickly on using XP/AMDD, Spring Framework, Hibernate and Eclipse, to name but a few. This hard-hitting, concise treatment is one of the reasons this book packs in the amount of information usually found in tomes twice its size."
4,"Excelente, pero ...","Desde el punto de vista de un desarrollador Java que quiere una buena introduccion a Spring, Hibernate, Eclipse y metodologias de desarrollo; y quiere enterarse de que manera pueden ayudarle a ser mas agil y productivo en el desarrollo, este es un excelente libro. Pero, para un desarrollador que ya tiene experiencia en ellos, no encontrara muchas novedades ni profundidad."
2,Not worth the money,"Most of the information in this book can be easily found on the Internet. I expected more from the book. It does somewhat good job in explaining the main concepts, but again -- nothing special. You can find all the materials presented in this book on the net."
4,"java, agile, hibernate","i did not finish the book yet, but it seams good from the begining, i will be back later to to put more information about it, but still worth the price, good luck"
3,Very light coverage,I liked the chapter 7. All other chapters are below average. Especially the sections that introduce the frameworks.The screenshots of how to use something are already available in other books and websites. So it does not add any value.The problem with this book is that it tries to cover lot of ground but does not do any justice to any of the topic. Because it does not cover them in depth.
1,Almost insulting,"This book was a huge disappointment and is more of a reference to online documentation sources than any sort of content. Time after time the auther just lists links to online documentation, FAQ's, etc instead of addressing it in the text. I bought the book b/c I found the online docs to be insufficient, I really don't need a book to point me where to go. If you are not able to use Google to find online info on Hibernate, Spring and eclipse, maybe this book would be of value. Otherwise, skip it."
2,Just nothing of any use,"This book's title doesn't match the actual content within. I read this book in about a week and I wasn't very impressed. You are better off going through the tutorials that are available online and learning from your mistakes. I promptly sold this book after reading it. I never had that ""this book will be useful for a while"" feeling."
5,A great CD available for $18 to $28 not $40+,"Hello:I think that this is a really great CD that showcases Hyde's voiced particulally well. I heartily recommend it to all those J pop listeners out there. Well I'm not sure Hyde is pop, but hey he's great. Anyway also I would like to let you know that although Amazon no longer has this CD for sale it is around out there for example at YesAsia.com and CDJapan, for the prices listed above. Don't go and pay more than they are worth to people who are trying to just steal away your hard earned cash. Instead encourage respectable businessmen. Amazon should be ashamed to let people sell stuff on here at x2price."
5,HYDE's Magic,"Okay, I admit I may be biased by my love of J-rock and adoration of HYDE, but ROENTGEN is one of my favourite things to listen to. HYDE combines soft sounds with emotion to create a world all of his own. When I listen, I get swept up in this world, and find myself feeling every song like they were my feelings alone. My favourite tracks from this CD are the wistful ""Shallow Sleep"", the tearful ""Cape of Storms"" and the dark ""Secret Letters"".A warning to listeners: If you enjoy this album, you may not enjoy his next albums, ""666"" and ""Faith"" unless you're a hardcore HYDE fan or a J-rock connoisseur. It has a much harder rock sound, but is enjoyable to me nonetheless."
1,Pure Noise in the least appealing sense,"If you enjoy music that sounds like good to the ear, skip this CD. ""Till I found you"" which is in rotation right now is absolutely irksome. The blend of voices is absolutely grating on the ear. Pass this P.O.S. up. Thi is not singing it is screaching. PEEE...UUUUUUU!!!!!!"
4,Great book + Great artist = Pretty good graphic novel,"I love anything by Mike Mignola, and Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser should have been a great adaptation for his style, but it just came off a little flat. That's really the only thing keeping it from a full five stars. Definitely worth picking up, especially for a Mignola fan."
1,Anticonner is misleading you.,"Weird that the word ""con"" should be in the name. This is not a graphic novel, not in the comic book sense of the word.It is a normal prose paperback you'd find at the grocery store; and you should pay no more than what is reasonable for such an item.Chances are if you're a Mignola fan, you're a fan of the art. The only Mignola art contained within is precious little.Buyers beware."
5,Stocking up for the Zombie Apocalypse,"We live pretty far out in the middle of nowhere here on 15 acres so I figured we will be one of the untouched areas when the zombie apocalypse occurs. We decided dropping $25,000 on a self contained little city would be perfect. Got solar panels for it and don't have to worry about diesel. We are also in the process of attempting to fortify it with lead sheeting to prevent radiation poisioning in case of fallout. It is pretty rommy inside. We are fit all 6 kids with cots and have plenty of storage for food and the 2 milking goats and 7 chickens. Now it is just a waiting game. Would recommend to anyone who knows the end is nigh and wants to survive in a world gone to the undead. It is not ""if"" anymore - it is when..."
3,Mature Trevino; Surprisingly flat,"While Rick Trevino's vocals have matured wonderfully, emotionally Trevino fails to bring it to the table. The title song, ""In My Dreams"" is probably the best song off the album. Hauntingly beautiful, Trevino brings longing to the song and nails it. ""Heartaches"" and ""Overnight Success"" bring the playful sounding Trevino along which most of us fell in love with to start with. Trevino's cover of ""Have You Really Loved a Woman"" while having a beautiful arrangement and had every chance of making us forget Bryan Adam's version fell flat vocally. The rest of the album is largely forgetable. All in all, a rather disappointing album from someone with so much talent!"
2,"Stereotyped; clumsy, awkward writing","I was hoping this book would be part of the new age of breaking the stereotypes of gender. However, Ms Rudd is too often stuck on defining femininity in a traditional, stereotypical way. Knocking down male stereotypes only to replace them with female stereotypes is no way to help anyone. There are typos, Ms Rudd is clearly not a writer full time, she makes references to studies and magazines that she obviously doesn't read, and shows enormous disrespect to feminists and feminism (the movement that continues to try and help women attain equality and which paved the way for men to question their gender roles). There is an emphasis on Christianity and God, and lots of bad poetry--but I found the bibliography and other references helpful. A mixed bag at best."
3,My Husband Wears My Clothes: Crossdressing from the Perspective of a Wife,"I have skimmed through the book but have not read it yet. I am currently reading ""My Husband Betty: Love, Sex, and Life with a Crossdresser"" written by Helen Boyd, which seems to give more insights into the perspectives of the partners of crossdressing men."
3,Fascinating read,"I'm not a liberal by any stretch of the imagination, but this did help me understand different points of view and lifestyle. A little boring since it does deal out some phsychobabble."
2,Did not work for me,I bought this book for my wife to read and understand the Crossdressing.The whole purpose was to make her informed about other women living with their CD husbands and accepting them happilly and infact enjoying it mutually. May be I was expecting too much from the book.Initially I attempted to read and after 5-6 pages I gave up reading and thought maybe it will appeal to my wife. Even she could not read more than 3-4 pages and in fact she left the book and never returned to it.Since then this book is in the closet in its original packing and wrapping. I feel the text could have been written better and interesting to at least read few chapters.
2,Good Product - poor customer service,"I received the calender in good time and it was what I wanted but I realized I had been overcharged. I contacted the company and was sent the email below:{In regards to your issue, the breakdown of your bill is as follows:I am not sure why you were charged tax, but you will be receiving a credit in the amount of $7.88 for the tax. Sorry for the inconvenience}.I never received the credit for the tax and when I called them was told they could do nothing. That it should be solved by Amazon."
1,"Can't Review ""The Best of Buddy Rich""--Never Received It!!","Your inventory procedures are VERY faulty. First, you said you had the item in stock. Then you said you did not, and referred me to Woody's Books. They said THEY had it in stock, and said they shipped 2 copies, not the one I ordered. Then they said 1 copy was returned to them (damaged) by the USPS, and the other was still on its way. Then they asked me to confirm delivery of the CD. Told them I couldn't, I hadn't received it yet. Then, 4 DAYS AFTER CHRISTMAS, they told me they didn't have the CD to ship after all!!! Does your right hand know what your left hand is doing? Does your right hand even KNOW there is a left hand? This could all have been avoided if you had given me the right information the first time. I am extremely dissatisfied with your service and procedures."
5,The Complete Peanuts! 1961-1962. What an amazing book! The peanuts just as you remember them from the paper!,What an amazing set of books. The peanuts complete gathers up all of the news paper strips and places them into wonderful 2 year volumes. Each Volume is a hard cover with beautiful book cover. High quality binding and paper go into these. I cannot imagine these volumes being any better. All of the classic peanuts strips you love gathered together in a nice 2 year volume! A wonderful addition to any library
5,Peanuts,"What a wonderful way to remember the Peanuts cartoons; by book, with each and every cartoon from the beginning to the end. Can't wait for the rest of the cartoons to be published."
4,Great!,"It's Peanuts. What more be said?In these years we can see Snoopy emerging in his more developed character.Diana Krall's introduction seems partial at best. Not sure if that's her writing style but, compared to other introductions, it isn't really the greatest."
5,They can't publish this collection quickly enough for my taste,"Peanuts was an essential part of my childhood. I love poring through all the ""complete"" volumes. I own them all. It's nice to follow the changing of the seasons, the gradual evolution of Schulz' drawing style, picking benchmark days from my childhood and reminding myself what comic strip I read on that particular day.I've never been the kind of collector that needed the ""complete"" anything, but in Sparky's case, I've made an exception."
2,no orchestra,"I expected a powerful orchestra behind him. Very disappointing. With such a voice, he needs this. does anyone know of an album that meets this criteria?"
3,Mystery,"This book while set in an often mysterious locale presents very little about Istanbul. It is kind of 'draggy', definitely an ""I want to go to sleep"" book."
5,History isn't boring!,Great way to get young readers interested in history. I found it an intriguing easy read that I intend to encourage all my children to read.
5,Muy bueno,Trevor Pinnock es un excelente ejecutor del clavicordio. Su interpretación de las seis partitas para clave es genial y la calidad del audio es excelente.Desde Venezuela Sur América
4,Great Covers and Creative New Songs,"Frankly, I am not one for covers. With some notable exceptions, the original groups generally get it right the first time. However, fifth-grade teacher Elizabeth Keeney not only does a credible job with her covers--she actually surpasses some of the original groups. This is no simple task given that she covers such megagroups as Foreigner (""I Want To Know What Love Is""), the Everly Brothers (""When Will I Be Loved""), the Rolling Stones (""As Tears Go By"") and Journey (""Open Arms"".)Her voice is strong and easy on the ears. Her phrasing is nice. Her combination of pop, rock and country is seamless. And the album is totally enjoyable from first cut to the last. This is a CD worth owning."
4,I always need a new humidifier wick at the start of the winter season.,"Each winter, I order another Essick Air humidifier wick for my now 18 year old Bemis humidifier. These humidifier wicks are very rare in local stores."
1,RIP-OFF,"THIS PRODUCT WAS ADVERTIZED AS BEING COMPATIBLE WITH THE Essick Air 4D7-800 Digital Humidifier.IT DOES NOT FIT THIS HUMIDIFIER!IT WAS SENT FROM THE ""BUY-IT-NOW STORE"" - A PARTNER OF AMAZON.HALF THE ORDER WAS NEVER EVEN SENT.THIS COMPANY DID NOT RESPOND TO MY E-MAILDO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS STORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Ehhh... it does the job - the job stinks though,"This does the job - it replaces that darn wick that keeps getting gross and smelly, and this one gets gross and smelly just as fast. Ended up buying a new humidifier because the Essick was large and clunky and had that gross wick that seemingly needed to be replaced all the time.If you like the humidifier, this is your wick. It is exactly what it purports to be. However, if you're looking for this wick, and just threw out its ancestral brethren, you may want to consider a new humidifier altogether."
4,The wick does the trick,There once was a wick from Essick AirIt humidified rooms without much flairIt got the job done without costing a tonSo next time I just might spring for a pair.
3,Not for true beginners,"I've been playing for about three years and have a pretty good sense of scales and chords, and had hoped this would help transition me to a beginning in acoustic blues. I'm disappointed.The DVD starts with a very drawn out description of what the author plans to do, and for some reason skips right over the two short exercises listed as ""examples"" as the beginning of the book.Strangely, the very first song he demos is in an alternate tuning, a concept that is introduced very matter of factly, and the song is intricate and complex, even for an intermediate player.I'd say this book might be good for an intermediate player but doesn't live up to its title as an introduction."
2,logic of the fretboard,when received the books contained the same text and tab more or less just different titles not content
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"Save your time and money and do not buy this bed!!! Poor quality-broke 4 times in a month already and my child never jumped on it. Vertical parts are different color than the rest of bed. First it arrived purple!!! I called and they send replacement parts that are painted over purple with light brown color and completly do not match the rest of bed. Moreover,I asked in email if twin mattress will fit it, they said ""yes"". In fact twin mattress is to small in length and hight and my son falls into spaces. Very dissapointed!!!!"
2,Video resolution horrible,"This is one of the great performances of all time. Anyone doubting the quality of her voice needs to own this compilation.However, the video quality is terrible. It looks like a home transfer from VHS. I would think the master tapes are around and could be at least digitally enhanced to remove the fuzziness."
4,The Pretenders - The Isle of View,If your as old a fan as me you will enjoy seeing and hearing Chrissie sing in this open and live format. No fluff no thrills just great music.
2,Pretend not available,"Very disappointing dvd, sound & vidio quality not so great. Cd edition has much better sound quality. This dvd is only for the diehard Pretenders fan. Better of buying the singles dvd instead."
1,These are cheap,"These sunglasses came in the mail and the lenses were scatched up and bent, so i would not suggest that u buy these."
3,Mirrored Sunglasses Review,"I like the product, but like others that I have purchased they are not very good quality. I bought two pair and the nose piece already broke on one set. The seller delivered it in good time and perfectly boxed."
3,Not for the active,Unless you got a big dome these aren't for you. I just used them for driving and playing poker...haha. When i try to walk around in them they fall of my head
1,Mirrored layer flakes off,"Within a week the mirrored covering started to flake off...but, I guess you get what you pay for. I liked them up until that happened."
5,Literary Lincoln without Sidekick Speechwriters or Dumbdowns,"This book chronicles not only texts of key speeches showing the evolution of Lincoln's view of slavery, but also insightful letters revealing some private thoughts of this shrewd railroad lawyer whose ambition propelled him to heights that made him the best President our Republic has ever seen. The 1838 Lyceum speech of Lincoln's youth gives stunning insight into that ambition. This book supports the notion that Lincoln was also the greatest writer to ever occupy the White House, revealing an impressive variety of literary styles, from meticulous legal argumentation to a dry, concise wit. In light of Lincoln's literary legacy, it is no wonder that each President since Woodrow Wilson has deemed the aid of professional speechwriters vital to their strategies. And even with the professional help the modern chief executives have gotten, Lincoln's rhetoric remains the most sublime of all our Presidents."
3,it's ok..,"i'm looking for a better aftershave gel than this for my microcuts/razor burn.pros - it's invisible. it doesn't smell. it has a nice texture.cons - it burns at first. it seems to make somewhat of a difference in FEELING, but not in REDNESS of razor burn. and it says it helps with redness! nope! i hope there's something better than this out there, because i sure do need it.summary - might be good enough for you, if you're just dealing with minor irritation and not actual cuts/razor burn."
1,Find something better,"I received this skull yesterday, hoping that I could use it for an animated Halloween prop. The jaw is severely distorted! I noticed that between the time I ordered it and the time I received it, the picture had changed. The picture shown currently has a slightly misshaped jaw - take the bottom of the jaw and move it to the left about 1/2"" more and that's what I received.The skull cap has large (1/8"") gaps and I've not tried to pry it off (doesn't come off so far with a significant tug). This is less than a 4th quality skull - the thing should have been melted down and re-cast. Sending back today."
1,Dissappointing Product,"I was execting a better product than what I received since it is a NUMARK product made in the U.K.. The Price was so tempting approx. $66, probably that's what you get when you pay cheap. But regarding the service of amazon, I have no complain about it, everything was smooth till I returned the product."
5,CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,BOUGHT THE FIRST BOTTLE AND IT WORKS GREAT!! EVERYONE ASK ME WHAT HAPPENING TO YOUR HAIR! I'M ON MY THIRD BOTTLE NOW. I'D BY A CASE IF I COULD GET A DEAL!!!!!!!
5,The best book to understand contemporary graphic design,"It is a great collection of great designers, and also a good way to realize that there's lot's of ways to avoid the common sense in design."
3,Expensive,This is overpriced for 23 sketches and we didn't need the coments from the 11 comedians. The space should have been used for more sketches.
4,Good book for mineral owners as well as students,"The third edition of this book was very helpful, and also included more recent case law cites than the second edition. I would assume this it true with the fourth as well (and there have been quite a few post 1995 court cases affecting royalty payments among other things). John Lowe is a well-respected professor of oil and gas law and has written many papers as well as several books on the subject.I find his writing style easy to understand, even for a layman like myself.I also found it to be much more than a ""nutshell"" approach in that the explanations of complicated ideas are fairly complete in most cases. He even touches on the structure and content of oil and gas sales contracts near the end of the book, which I found helpful as well."
5,correct product and on time,"This is the correct product and arrived on time. The product itself is great, i definitely recommend this to anyone taking Oil and Gas Law."
4,Enjoyed it.,"I really enjoyed this book. If you are a new fan, as i am, you will find it a worthwhile. I'm still learning about Bob Marley, and this book was a great source of information."
4,Tea Please!,"I am not a coffee drinker, so I go for tea instead. I am no connoisseur, but I do like brewing my teas in this steeper. It is so neat! you place your tea leaves in, pour hot water over, close the lid, set the timer... then the best part... place the whole thing on top of your cup and push down. The tea pours right out of the bottom!!! Awesome, and fun! My kids love watching it. lol!We have two of these, one for me and one for my husband. He has his at work. I also liked that we could buy a sample pack of tea leaves to try out some of the neat ones the company offers. However, you can use any kind of tea; leaves or bags, it's all the same.I thought it was kind of silly at first, but now I am really happy with this product. Easy to use, clean, no drippy / messy teas bags to squeeze out or drip everywhere, no problems with workmanship."
1,Buyer Beware,"We ordered this product and it was never shipped. We tried to email through Amazon and through the company's own online site with NO communication. The product price was raised [...] during this time and I feel they ignored our order to receive more money as we were never contacted. There were given ample opportunity to respond to 6 emails and 2 phone calls and they did not. I would be very careful doing business with this company. Even though it has great reviews, I have heard that companies pay for people to do these reviews for them. I don't know if that is what happened here, I only know that we were totally ignored on a [...] total order."
4,Good tea,"The tea is great, fantastic even. The pot is ok, cleaning it can be a bit bothersome and there are small pieces that can be lost or misplaced, since they must be removed to clean."
4,Nice little teapot,Bought this set for my mom for her birthday. She prefers tea in the afternoon as a pick-me-up instead of coffee. She was able to get the hang of brewing loose tea after an initial time or two. Has had no difficulty with the teapot and reported that the teas were really good tasting.
2,I used to like tea,"This looked like a great way to make tea at work - it wasn't. The tea maker worked well - that covers the two stars but the tea was terrible!I've tried different types of green tea, love lady earl grey and lots of fruity flavored kinds. One of the tea samples that came with this smelled sooooo bad that as soon as it was done brewing, I immediately dumped it down the drain and fumigated the kitchen. The citron tea was the closest to being drinkable and I had to use 2 to 3 times as much tea as was instructed and still it was like drinking hot water. So my advice is keep the tea maker and quickly dispose of the tea."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I bought this for my husband as a gift, as he enjoys a cup of green tea (teabag form) every night. I had heard that once you try steeped tea leaves, you'd never go back to teabags. Unfortunately, that has not been the case. It is difficult to determine the amount of tea to use, as some are milder, some are stronger. The concept is good and I like that it can be made quickly in the microwave. I just wish there was more information on amounts to use. Husband is back to using teabags for now."
5,"Great Product, Great Price, Nice tins","The Gourmet Green Tea Set is a bargain. The tea is fresh and flavorful! The teapot is nice, even if it is plastic. Tea prep is a snap. You fill the pot with water, nuke it in the microwave, put your green tea leaves directly in the water. Wait 3 minutes. Put the pot on the top our your cup and it drains perfectly in your cup! Enjoy."
4,Delicious green tea!,"First, I just have to say how incredibly convenient the IngenuiTea tea maker is. It's so easy to use, and dishwasher safe, a great convenience.The teas are very good. The flavor is subtle, and may seem weak if you are used to very strong tea, but I prefer the milder flavors. Two of them particularly stand out. The citron green is mildly sweet, with a fruity note, that actually reminds me of Froot Loops cereal, in a very good way. :) The hojicha is a traditional Japanese style green that you may have tried at sushi restaurants. It's a little woody with a smoky undertone. I think I'll shortly be ordering full sized packages of those.If you're a fan of subtle, exotic green teas, you will really enjoy this assortment."
1,All ego,I agree with the recent reviewers and those mysteriously wiped off recently and no longer here to see that dared criticise him. The problem with Cohen is his complete insecurity. He cannot for a moment bear any criticism but requests complete adulation. I read his books and attended one of his lectures. Never again. He is total ego and loves laughing at people making fun of them in front of others while he has the microphone. I know he desparately seeks enlightenment himself but surely this is not the way Andrew. Try to be nice to people.
5,Mind Bogglin Reality,"I am well pleased with the service I received as well as the content of the book. As is his style...Andrew Cohen has reduced a ""mind-boggling"" truth to an understandable read."
3,wait a minute folks...,"how has Cohen and his cult members managed to wipe out every critical customer review of this book??? Cohen's Living Enlightenment is good in theory, but ask his ex-students what ""living"" under Cohen's authoritarian ideas for your enlightenment was like -- not so wonderful?"
5,No Middle Ground ...,"If you've ""got it"", you will know Cohen is speaking Truth. If you are in ""seeking mode"" and are not willing to shift, I predict you will just get frustrated and the words will just sound like a bunch of noise.I think the book is most valuable as a reminder and reinforcement for the spiritually ""mature"" individual.The book, I think, is actually a good ""acid test"" for your ontological ""status""!I admire Andrew for his unswerving commitment to Truth. He is way ahead of his time, and is ""planting seeds"" for anentirely new society that, I believe, will emerge over the next few HUNDRRED years.If you have psycho-physical tools for navigating the rapids, Andrew can take you ""home""."
2,Disappointing,This recording didn't compare to the original Roches done in the 90's. It sounded manipulated by electronics. Also we hoped to hear more of the songs done in the first one.
2,Dissapointment,"I bought this tape a while ago and have not used it much since. The workout is compact, but does not have much else going for it. I used to watch Crunch fitness on a regular basis, and loved it. I am very dissapointed with this product. The moves actually start out difficult, resulting in a lot of rewinding to get them right, and get easier as the tape goes on. They also get more ridiculous as the tape progresses. I was looking for a tape that would get my heart pumping but though my heart rate did increase, I did not break a sweat while the instructor did. Her favorite move, ""the swim"", combined with her hooting and hollering did nothing for me. I would recommend other Crunch fitness products to people but not this one."
3,not my favorite workout,"This video, like all crunch videos is loud which I like and find encouraging and it will definately works up a sweat, gets your heart pumping & get (or keep) you in shape. However, it I found it difficult to follow, a little too much dancing for my taste. Its a good workout, but not my favorite."
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought this video a couple of years ago when I wanted to start exercising, but I found it disappointing. First of all, I'm sorry but the style of the video is just too corny for me, with lots of whooping and cheering by the cast, harsh lighting, and no-frills setting. That probably shouldn't matter, but it did to me. Secondly, I don't think I'm a complete klutz but I found that the steps were too tricky for a beginner; they are not explained very well, but instead the instructor just launches right in to the workout. It takes several tries to figure out the steps, and by then it's not long before you begin to get bored. In a class, the instructor can vary the workout from week to week, but on video, once you learn the routine, that's it: if you want variety, you have to buy a different tape. Obviously a lot of people like this video, because it seems to be popular, but it didn't work for me. Since then I have found other exercise tapes and routines that I like much better."
4,It's my regular!,"It is a good aerobic workout that is not too exhausting, just right. The arm exercises really help reduce my arm and neck pain I get from sitting at a computer for hours everyday. The hoots of the dancers and their enthusiasm actually cheers me on. Also, I like the three sections rather than one long choreography that some videos have. The lunges are quick, so watch out to avoid injury. The stretches aren't quite enough for my taste, but I do them afterward on my own. All in all, I have done this one repeatedly for years and am not yet tired of the personalities. I know I can count on this one for a good, familiar workout and use it regularly."
2,Are you kidding me?,"The instructor on this video is incredibly over-enthusiastic in a really annoying way. She reminded me of the cheerleader on Saturday Night Live-- you know, the irritatingly enthusiastic Cheri O'Teri character ""Spartan Spirit""? Her voice sounds the same, she does this ""Uh Oh-- now try this"" line over and over again. I scanned it once to see how hard the moves would be, then tried to do it myself. The moves were fairly okay, but the video itself really got on my nerves. The group working out here also yells and whistles and acts like they are having the best time in the world, and the general feel of the tape just made me want to put in my old Cher tape and appreciate how less annoying it was.Don't get this if you are someone who would find working out with the Spartan Cheerleaders annoying."
3,Correct track listing,"1. Oh Come All Ye Faithful (short version)2. Oh Come All Ye Faithful (long version)3. Go Tell It On the Mountain4. O Come O Come Emanuel5. Holdin' Onto Christmas6. Little Town Of Bethlehem7. Little Drummer Boy8. Silent Night9. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer10. Oh Holy Night11. A Not So Silent Night (from the Warner Bros Soundtrack ""Believe In Santa"")"
2,Very Unsettling,"While the story was supernaturally entertaining, it does not deserve to be the third story in a trilogy. It ended terribly! It really did not answer many questions, and it even managed to raise a few new questions. The ending was also a tad sachreligious. Jude needs to stick to writing about romance, and leave the paranormal alone."
1,what happened????,how did it end???what was resolved???...i read this book but did not find out what happened to her husband and to her family...very poorly written....
3,Not bad but not great,"I have been waiting for ages for this book to be released after having read the other two in the series. Whilst it was an ok book in itself it did not conclude the trilogy properly. There was no explanation about how events changed Adam, Darci and Bo let alone the other characters. If you accept the ending to this book the two previous books could never have happened and therefore I guess Linc never found his son. Also Darci would never have met Jack and his father so again things could not have worked out correctly. The last few chapters just seem to have been rushed without thought as to how they would affect the storyline in general. Not the best of Ms Deveraux's stories."
1,This Book Is Seriously Lacking....,"I really enjoyed the other novels in this series. This book has no continuity with the other two and is downright crappy. It was so bad, I thought I was reading Paris Hilton acting.This novel didn't answer any questions. Instead it left the reader with more questions.It almost seems like the author got tired of writing this book and let a fifth grader with a vivid imagination complete it.With this novel the author has managed to get over on the public, due to her good reputation. If a first time author had penned this, they would be banned from writing again and their publisher would drop them......Wait....No first time author would get a publisher to release this drivel.I honestly hope she writes a fourth novel to clean up this mess."
2,Very sad,"I am a big fan of Jude Deveraux,and I have enjoyed every one of her books I have read,including Forever and forever always but was very dissapointed in this novel.Maybe she will write a forth book of this series.I hope.I really liked Darcy and I love Adam and the fact that is cousin Michael Taggart,""Sweet Liar"" another Jude book, is mentioned in this book.Along with some of the characters and plots intoduced in this story.But I was left unsettled by the books end."
1,A complete letdown@,I was so disappointed at the abrupt and difficult to follow ending of a book that dragged from start to almost finish. I really expect more of Jude Deveraux that a hastily thrown together mish mosh of ideas. What a waste of $7.99.
2,Always....,"I bought Always the day it came out and read it all in the same day. While I still love Ms. Deveraux and have read every one of her books, I felt totally let down by this book. There were too many loose ends with many of the characters. I wanted to find out where Adam was and how she would find him. But most of all why he was taken. The ending just did not live up to her endings in the past. I love the romance associated with the Montgomery's and the Taggerts. There was no romance in this book, it left me wanting much more then I got."
3,Abrupt ending....,"I love Jude's books and have since they first came out, but this book started out good (with little romance though) and ended before I knew what was going on! The last 2 pages have to mean that there will be more to this. Maybe it was just me, but there are a lot of loose ends in this book. What happened with the necklace she found, and I have many questions as some of the other reviewers do about what happened to Adam & Bo when they disappered. I truly love Jude's books and I like this paranormal thing, but I don't like that there are loose ends and questions left unanswered. Shouldn't someone be reading her books and asking her all the questions we have? I miss her books like Highland Velvet, The Taming and I loved Remembrance. Maybe the romance will come back in her next book!"
3,How can this be the ending?,"After finishing Always, I honestly cannot believe that this is the end of the story. There are so many gaps left open that need to be explored. I loved the story of Forever, and I thought the adventure in Forever and Always was highly entertaining, but Always leaves too much untold."
1,Always,"It's probably my own fault that I hated this book. This is not my usual genre of fiction, but I was desparate and in a hurry at the airport, so I grabbed Always.Yikes, how far-fetched can a book get? And I was amazed to learn that this book was part of a series. Are Jude Deveraux's books all this far-fetched?The characters were shallow and I didn't get the point of most of the plot. Perhaps this was because I'm a skeptic when it comes to the the ""psychically gifted""."
3,Not Quite Worth the Wait,"My first thought after reading ""Always"" was 'who wrote this book?'. Past fans of Deveraux's Montgomery series will be disappointed with this book. This is not a romance. Deveraux should have rethought this storyline. Magic, time travel, psychics, ghosts...it has too many paranormal components for too little of a storyline. Romance fans will want to borrow this book from the library and save $$s for a true romance. This book lacked romantic substance and a satisfying ending to the question of what happened to Adam and his sister."
3,Good read but still lacking,"I liked the book. Personally I liked it better than the one before it. But you still don't know much about the husband or kids or the sister.I had never read any of her books before and started with Forever & Always. Then I read Always. But I do like her writing. It's interesting and kind of original. At least from what I've read. She makes you want these kinds of things to actually be real, yes, it's almost believable. But that means she's just a good writer. :)A-"
2,I really liked the series BUT,"Really it ended in a way that made you think that there was going to be another book. I am very sad to see that this is a last book and that is that which almost makes it not work the read. I love Jude Deveraux's books, I really do but I haven't read a series that ended this way before. I rated it high because over all I did like the series, but as far as I'm concerned it needs to be finished. What happens?"
2,Not to beat a dead horse...,"But like many others, I just wasn't that satisfied. I tend to read action, adventure or mysteries. I look to romance because I want something fun, wild and finished! Call me dull, but I like an ending where the two main characters get together, and although in the end that sort of happened, it wasn't what you would expect. I enjoyed the story, up until the last 40 or 50 pages, then things seemed to just move along way to fast. Why take the time to create characters and explore lives if you are just going to warp them up so quickly?Someone also mentioned, A Knight in Shining Armor. I would also like to see some sort of conclusion there. Just like in this series, it would be nice to see some kind of follow up that shows what happens to Adam and Darci. All in all, I was disappointed with the ending, but I admit that I will stick around to see what Devereux comes up with next."
2,Always & Lacking,I read the first book and was hungry for more. After the second I was still intrigued. But the third is an utter and total disappointment. I had to make myself continue to read it as it took total concentration to stay interested. I was very disappointed by the writing and pace of the book in general. I like the Darci character and love the romance between her and Adam. I'd like to see a follow up or maybe a spin off about the children.Overall a disappointment. Not a MUST read but a SHOULD finish if you want to know how the trilogy resolves and ends.
1,"""Always"" by Jude Deveraux","I love to read romance, especially science fiction/fantasy romance, and I'm easy to please, so a book has to be really bad for me NOT to find at least one redeeming feature. This, however, has got to be the worst, most convoluted story I've ever read. I've never written a review before and I hate for my first one to be so negative, but I wanted to prevent someone else from wasting their time and money on this garbage. Are all of Miss Deveraux's novels this bad?"
1,Oh Please,"I have been a fan of many of Ms. Deveraux's books, but this one was so bad - I'm sorry, but the ending was horrid! That's all I can say about it - it's just not worth it."
2,Disappointed,"I was really let down by this book. I am an avid Jude Deveraux reader and usually snap up her books as soon as they come out. I loved the first book in this series and the second was ""ok"", but this one left me confused and feeling that HUGE holes were left open. Where is/was Adam? Why was he taken? Where is the gripping story of finding and rescuing him as so many other Devereaux heroines in the past have done? I don't want to give away the ending to anyone, but I felt that this ending was extremely unsatisfiying and a huge cop-out on the part of the author. Jude, how could you?"
2,"YIKES, what the heck just happened","This final installment of the Trilogy: Forever and Forever and Always was a major disappointment. Both previous novels were fun and fluid reading. With characters you got to know and care about.And most importantly, you knew what was going on!This is a disaster of a book. It is simply all over the place and leads to nowhere.Ms. Deveraux and her publishing house goofed. Their theme song must be ""What was I thinking"".If you invested your reading time in the first two, probably like me you will make yourself read to the end of ALWAYS to see what happens. But, when you do get to the end, you still won't know what happens, or if you do, heh, you won't know you do.And if you found that last sentence confusifying, wait till you read the book.How many stars signify a feeling of What the heck just happened?"
5,Great Buy,Great buy. I bought it for my sister who just recently became a bollywood fanatic and she loved it as part of her Christmas gifts.
2,Works well but problems with the cover,"The KitchenCalc does conversions as promised and is very good at them. The timing functions also work.But, the device came with a flexible plastic cover to allow it to be used in a cooking envronment. To put the cover on, you need to stretch it to the point that several keys at the edge are forced down. This keeps the calculator from working.How can a product be sold without even minimal functionality testing? Yes - it calculates. But, no, the KitchenCalc is not splashproof. Didn't anyone try using the calculator with the flexible plastic shield on?It's worth buying, but keep it clear of the cooking area. Rated 2 stars because the lack of a functional cover keeps it from being used in the food-preparation area."
4,Great time saver,"I often take recipes from very few servings to servings for 50 or more to handle feeding volunteers on Kingdom Hall construction projects. This calculator is a major help to figure out what to purchase and cook. I use it all the time! Easy to figure out, accurate and large enough to see easily. I wish it used photo cells for power, but the battery seems to last a long time."
2,Just get a smartphone app.,"One of the few Amazon purchases in the last six months that I regret. Calculator is big (HUGE!!) and I don't find the operation to be at all intuitive. It never gets used and it takes up quite a bit of room in my kitchen drawer. I'd probably throw it out, but then it would take up a bunch of space in a landfill instead of my kitchen. Absolutely my own fault for not fully understanding what I was buying. The KitchenCalc 8300 by the same company is much more compact and might have been a more appropriate choice, but I think there are even better options than that.If you have a smartphone (Android or iPhone), iPad, or iPod touch then there are several cooking and unit conversion apps that offer much more flexibility and ease of use. To keep you electronics safe from bits of food you can slide them inside a ziploc bag - the touchscreen will work fine through the plastic."
3,Kinky!,"The 1st couple feet of tubing on this 20' roll was kinked and unusable, I wish they would roll it in a larger diameter to avoid this problem!"
4,Hydro,I bought this for a hydro set up I designed. If fit perfect with my 1/2' hose connector. Great quality.
4,Does what I wanted,A hose is a hose is a hose. I have an outdoor fountain and this works like it's suppose to.
1,tubing,I didn't know the pump came with the tubing and it was too expensive to return versus the cost of the product itself.
3,As everyone else said...,"Well... the package came in a prompt fashion. It was coiled very tightly and the kinks everyone else spoke of in their reviews were readily apparent. They are not sufficient to exclude the use of the kinked areas and I don't think it will be a problem to use. Please note, you are getting 20 feet of tubing for a very good price and the kinks can be worked out with a little effort and some muscle. The tubing is pretty stiff and seems as though it will be last for a very long time. Even with the kinks I would still recommend the product and the seller."
3,Expect to lose at least a foot or two from kinks,The tubing arrived with about a foot or two horribly kinked up and virtually unusable. The tubing isn't pliable enough to easily knock the kinks out so I cut it off and tossed it. The rest of it is perfectly fine though (a few kinks but nothing bad) so I now have 18 feet of usable tubing.
1,Kinks in the PVC Tubing,"Purchased the 1/2 inch tubing to go with my sunterra pump (also a flop). It arrived all neatly rolled up in a box. In unrolling it, half of the roll had kinks every 4-6 inch that would not straighten out. I called Sunterra and they sent a replacement. This one had only 4 ft with kinks in it. I went to my local hardware store to get a replacement this time."
2,"Yeah baby, kinky!","It is 1/2 inch black tubing; it won't grow algae inside and it is rough so it will more-or-less stay put, and it has some elasticity so you can pour boiling water on it and stretch it over the lip of a fitting. But it kinks like nobody's business and that is my biggest gripe.25 feet is nice and long so I've used this in 2 pools in unstructured under-water routing and it kinked in both situations. And, it doesn't like to go back to an unkinked state. If you bury this outside your watercourse I can almost guarantee you it will change form and kink and your flow rate will suffer. Keep looking!"
3,"Rolled Up Hose, Won't Unkink","I got this hose to use to pump water 4ft vertically to create a small rain curtain. It came out of the package tightly rolled up. When I get around to testing the hose for leaks, it kinked every 4-6 inches because it took shape to the coil it was packaged in. I tried to massage the kinks out but it didn't work. It greatly effected the flow rate of the pump. I ended up using 1/4"" vinyl tubing which far outperformed the half inch PVC tubing. I have to say, for the price, not too much harm was done, but I can't, in all good faith, recommend the hose to others."
4,Tippmann A-5 review,"Over all a very good marker. Took it out to play last saturday, very durable, reasonably accurate. Only complaint is that its an air hog, hence the reason I couldn't give it the 5 stars. Would definately reccomend a buy if you were going to buy a flatline barrel and a e-grip for it, if you don't want to spend the money though I would reccomend a cheaper gun such as a Spyder MR-1, or Smart Parts SP-1."
5,never had a problem with it,Ive had mine since the marker first came out..Ive never had a single problem with it...its pretty accurate for a stock barrel. Some ppl complain that its too big..but it feels right to me. This is probably one of the best scenario guns u could buy. Ive enjoyed it imensely
4,She's amazing,"From this brilliant dance single to her looks and ambition, I can see Amanda as being the next best thing. I love the album version, but I think my favourite mix is the Boy George & Kinky Roland Trancesexual mix. Buy the single today! I can't wait for her album to be released!"
1,Misleading,"The web information fails to mention the main ingredient is alcohol, with a small percentage as ""pure"" extract."
3,flat and,"I have to admit that my daughter loves these books. But I think they are much less than they could have been. The illustrations are attractive but have no dramatic power and no personality. All the people look the same. The stories reveal no individuality in the characters. Everyone gets along and behaves well, and no desires conflict. I think the idyllic quality is part of what appeals to my daughter, but I think she also enjoys seeing some details of how people lived in a very different time."
2,WRITTEN BY FAMILY,I FOUND IT INTERESTING BECAUSE OF THE FAMILY CONNECTION AND HISTORY. IT WAS REPETITIVE. POLITICAL VIEWS IN LINE WITH COLLEGE AND HIGHER EDUCATORS. I DEFINITELY DIDN'T CARE FOR THE LIBERAL PHILOSOPHY. VALUE THE AUTHOR AND PROUD OF HIM AS A FAMILY MEMBER. AM HAPPY I HAVE THE BOOK. LEARNING TO LIVE WITH DIFFERING POLITICAL VIEWS WITHIN FAMILIES IS NECESSARY AND IMPORTANT.
5,"It may not be HTLJ,but it's the next best thing!","I absolutely love this tape! Hearing the voices of Kevin Sorbo & Michael Hurst reading the story of Hercules is just wonderful! The only drawback is that Kevin's side of the tape is shorter than Michael's,but I can't really complain about that,since they do such a fantastic job! I just wish it were available on cd somewhere!"
4,pleasant to read,"This book did not only offer a 'plesant read' but I also found the illustrations stimulating and the text easy to follow. I enjoyed the paragraphs about playing with metal clay,glass and ceramics,the Hollow Bead Bracelet and the Origami chapter. But in the final pages I somehow lost interest as the 'Inspiration' pages were not very inspiring for me.All in all, I am pleased I bought the book. It certainly inspired me to find my own inspiration!"
2,metal clay magic,"This book is full of great designs, however- I would not recommend this book for any self taught student. One can be self taught and not have to spend $300+ on a teacher telling you what you can learn on your own. Metal clay is NOT a hard product to learn. There are too many books on the market that read the same and have the same information on metal clay. My advise, free tutorials on the net are the best way to learn. Not only are the books on the market the same on metal clay, but do all of the authors have to word their instructions on every single move that their hands make? In conclusion, this book is good for the basics of metal clay and to make the designs in the book only. You can incorporta your own ideas after learning the way to execute a design. Purchase one or two great books on metal clay and leave it at that."
2,Great concept marred by major bugs,"Elite Warriors: Vietnam was created around an amazing concept. It combines tactical FPS elements with squad-level logistics, land navigation, and open ended objective-based game play. Elite Warriors: Vietnam could perhaps have been my favorite game of all time, but unfortunately even after I applied the patch it has several game-destroying bugs. Far too often, when the game tries to load a new FPS map, it passes garbage values for ammunition count, and slows to a freeze. Reloading saved games and reloading the level do not fix these game-destroying bugs. Even though I am in love with the concept since the game has been released with major bugs that completely undermine the long-term planning and logistical aspects of the game, I am afraid that I must give it a poor rating of 2 stars."
3,fair enough,"This book did a great job in explaining method and the derivation..But the logic is not quit clear as I expected.I should say it is helpful to my class, but as a textbook, it is not enough.."
4,it works as planned...,"it got here on time it was in brand new conditions and its great i charge just about anything, my phonr my camara my daughter's mp3....and anything realy i like it..ADRY"
1,Don't buy this.,"It didn't charge my cell phone, it overheated, it smelled like an electrical fire, and it fell apart when I removed it from the power socket in my car. The good news: no fire, my cell phone still works."
2,Worked. For a little while.,"Received product and began using it to charge my Motorola Droid phone in the car. After less than a month, the adapter stopped working."
1,Another money saving item costing more that it's worth,"Soon after using this charger, my van had an electrical malfunction. After paying a couple hundred dollars to run a diagnostic, the shop found out that two fuses had blown on my van. The mechanic asked if I had been using a car charger, as it was on the same electrical circuit as the fuses that blew. Since this was the only new charger, I must hold it responsible."
1,Defective,"The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work. Initially, i thought that there was something wrong with the power outlet, so I hooked my old charger up to it (its broken on the phone connector end) and the blue power light lit up. The new charger power light never came on and it wouldn't charge the phone. Very dissatisfied."
4,USB Car Charger Adapter,"This product is cheaply made, but very inexpensive and works great! It only cost me a few dollars and I LOVE IT!!!"
3,works ok,only gripe I got is it has to be positioned just right to power on; at first I thought it was that outlet but I had the same issue on several vehicles
3,Didn't work with Creative Zen,Maybe I didn't read the fine print enough so it may not be fair of me to say its a bad product. It doesn't claim it works with Zen. I thought a universal USB car charger would work with Zen. This is not the case. It caused my Zen to crash immediately. I needed to go through the Zen reset procedure to get it to come back.
1,Worthless,The plastic cap holding fuse broke right away making the product unusable. Why did I throw packaging away...
5,Works Great,"I was needing a usb charger for my ipod as well as for my phone. car phone charger and a ipod charger would of been about 50+ bucks.For $2.45 usd, i thought i would give it a try. It works great. i would recommend to whom ever is needing one"
1,Junk,"Bought two if these, one broke apart at the first time use. Both don't have enough current capacity to charge my HTC HD2 phone."
2,"Charges my Zune, but the line noise....","This thing works fine for charging my zune, but if I'm playing music while getting power from this, it puts a lot of noise into the signal. Enough noise to make me throw this thing away. If all you need it for is USB power without playing music, it'll work fine."
1,Not worth it..,"This is a total waste, never charges your phone, I tried both my iPhone and Razr, both of them never gets charged."
2,it broke,Well it broke. After maybe 4 months it fell apart. Next time I'm going to pay more and get something more reliable.
4,Super Fast Shipping,"Product was what I expected, and works for my GPS. Super fast shipping... shipped within three hours of placing my order!!"
2,Low quality product,This product's quality is as low as it's price. It makes sense that the price is marked down from about $15 to under $3.The unit failed after being used three times. The spring that pushes the power pickup tip out broke.
4,GOOD BUT COULD BE BETTER,"this book provides great pics of ferraris, and gives a good historical backround about enzo. it also has stats of all the cars. but it is missing some models and some of the data is wrong, it could be better but it is a cool book."
4,reissue on dvd,"While it was well done, turns out this was a reissue of a 1978 video I had already seen. Guess I need to read details more carefully."
5,Healthy and affordable,I love country life products. If you want just the basic RDA for the b vitamins this is the one to choose. Many of the others have the same milligrams for everything.
1,Im sorry,Im so sorry that your daughter was burt by a Care Bear.I do not like Glow In The Dark Care Bears now.
2,Happy Trance is not for me :(,"This is a tight CD for those who enjoy happy trance. I prefer hard trance and deep trance, and that is certainly NOT what this CD set is all about. Buyer Beware, listen to samples before you purchase."
5,Bewildered trip,"20! songs on a vinyl was quite an amazing quantity and when the QUALITY of each one of these songs are even more amazing, well we talk CLASSIC. I never experienced a more bewildered trip with an album from the first puzzeld listning to when all the 20 songs had crystallized. ""Get Happy!!"" totaly occupyed my body and soul and still do. To mention certain tunes feels meaningsless when ALL of them are indispensable.The bonus-CD is also great. EP- and B-side tracks (""Girls Talks"", ""Hoover Factory"", ""Ghost Train"" for instence) are superb and the demoversions are rougher and sometimes different from the orginals so you need them also."
3,More Like 'Got Hyped',"Another 'classic' from the EC canon that I find underwhelming. Not a bad recording...just a lot of music that's only moderately entertaining. Favorites are 'High Fidelity', 'New Amsterdam' and 'I Can't Stand Up..."". Most of the other better songs are on the generous second disc of the Rhino reissue: 'Girls Talk', 'B Movie', 'Getting Mighty Crowded' and 'Just A Memory'.As with my opinion of 'My Aim is True', I know my lack of enthusiasm for 'Happy' puts me in the minority of Costello fans. I can't help but wonder if the critical praise heaped on both these recordings resulted in some rose-coloring of people's perspective over the years? Or (more likely?) maybe I'm simply one of the few clueless rabel who just don't get it."
5,Breathtaking,"GET HAPPY was introduced to me by a co-worker back in 1980. At that time, I only had a handful of Elvis Costello singles (remember 45s?) but no albums. After the moment my co-worker lent me the album, I never stopped listening to Elvis Costello and to this album in particular. The rush of twenty two-minutes-and-change songs was breathtaking and still is. Its mix of passionate love tunes, whimsical poppiness, and downright raw soul was unprecedented.I only wish I could reach back across the decades to shake that guy's hand for lending me GET HAPPY."
4,An improtant book to read.,The book is all that could be expected of such an old publication. The fly cover I will probably discard.The book was first copyrighted in 1920 and comes out of the Linoln Memorial University. It presents aside of Lincoln's life that is important to know. His faith was a vital part of his leadership and is somethingthat is missing in today's politics. Good government is always based on having a righteous people.
3,A Simple Diversion,"This book is so easy to read, you can't help but like it. The breezy style and quirkiness of the main character make it a nice diversion. But I found myself wondering if an editor ever saw this book before it went to print. There were too many one-liners and odd flashbacks that should have been cut. The most ridiculous example of this is the last line of the novel. I can't believe a publisher actually allowed that sentence to see the light of day.If you haven't read it already, your time is probably better spent on Nick Hornby's High Fidelity. That novel is far more resonant, deeper in its exploration of the twisted male psyche, and much more triumphant in its message of how love can make anyone crazy."
1,Sick stalker schtick,"Tim Sandlin's ""Sex and Sunsets"" is no more and no less than a story about a crazy, stalking dishwasher & his naive, confused, pathetic victim. Kelly Palomino, the completely unlikeable main character, is without any redeemable features. He is not particularly witty or clever, he cannot hold a job, he is not described as being remotely attractive, he hears voices in running water (?) and he spends his time lurking about following and terrorizing the innocent (although equally dull and unlikeable) heroine, Colette, with whom he becomes obsessed on her wedding day when he sees her kick a football. The plot and especially the ending tries the reader's patience and insults female intelligence."
1,Thumbs down!,"Tim Sandlin's outlook on life is a bit disturbing. The plot of this story is definitely strange and if you're looking for a surprise ending, you'll find it here. I didn't find the characters to be a bit believable. This book only evoked a mild disgust in me. I know it is just a story, but the premise of this book is not harmless. I consider it a bit insulting to women. I've read another of Sandlin's other books and it was better than this. I was disappointed with ""Sex and Sunsets""."
1,Not worth the time or the money to read.,It wasn't worth my time or money to read this. A very immature piece of literature -- probably aimed for the teenage segment.
5,Heart & Humor,"Sex & Sunsets is a book rich in heart and humor both of which are prerequisites for reading and appreciating Tim Sandlin's wonderful storytelling. If you have a deficit in either area, you may want to look elsewhere.Kelly Palomino is an unforgettable character who appears at first glance to be clearly insane. As the story unfolds and we learn of Kelly's unique background, we begin to understand how he has come to relate to the world in a way truly his own.I highly recommend Sex & Sunsets and all of Tim Sandlin's books. His talent matches the size of his heart and his sense of humor, a rare treasure."
2,From a masculine perspective...,"My girlfriend hated this book so I figured that I would like it. The description on the back cover sounded fun - a guy goes a bit crazy for a while after some bad times, and becomes obsessed with a beautiful stranger.I was disappointed with how the author presented his two main characters. His description of Colette (the beautiful stranger) didn't appeal to me, and Kelly Palomino (the obsessed guy) had an unconvincing character with a mish-mash of character traits that didn't seem to add up to a real person.In the end, I disliked the book as much as my girlfriend had because the characters and the plot didn't seem to add up. The plot seemed thrown together. Some parts were pretty funny, but I need more than a few chuckles to hold my attention."
5,Start Sandlin with This One,"Don't be swayed by the negative reviews for this book! Tim Sandlin's stories are not steeped in realism, they require a suspension of disbelief and a light hearted approach.Far from being a creepy stalker, the main character Kelly Palamino (best protagionist name ever!) is a die hard romantic, playful and self-depricating, who falls in love and perserveres against all odds. Sure, it's a plot that been been done before, but I've never come across an ending as satifying. Those who feel his character isn't believable aren't being honest with themselves. All of us share Kelly-like quirks, thoughts and motives, (we just don't act on them the way he does!)Sandlin is one of the few authors who makes me laugh out load and every once in a while hits upon a universal truth about life that delights. I think the people who didn't enjoy this book just don't ""get"" Sandlin's sense of humor and style. I feel lucky that I'm someone who does."
2,This book is made of wood...,"This story traces a few months in the lives of a couple of wooden characters. The book's premise of a ""loser"" finally getting the girl had potential, but the author made the main character (Kelly Palomino) a bit too unlikeable. His conquest, Colette, was also unlikeable. I was left wondering what the two of them could ever see in each other.If you have time for a good read, I'd highly recommend Kurt Vonnegut, J.D. Salinger, or Tom Robbins, all of whom Tim Sandlin has been compared to in these reviews. I don't think that this book measures up to the comparison."
4,Introduction to Tim Sandlin,"This is the first book I've read by Tim Sandlin, and what an introduction! Kelly Palamino is at once crazy, likeable, annoying, and just plain sad. From the first line this book grabbed me and wouldn't let go. Intersting characters throughout, and twists and turns that were completely unexpected. I recommend to anyone looking for that ""not your ordinary novel""."
5,A testament on how far one will go for love!,"Why a movie producer hasn't snapped this property up is beyond me.Kelly Palamino is focused on one thing and one thing only, the woman named Colette. His obsession begins when Colette kicks a football seconds before her wedding and it grows through a progression of rejections, torments, and self abuse until he wins the object of his dreams.If all humans were as focused as Kelly is in the pursuit of their goals everybody would be a winner."
1,Is this the first draft?,"If you've read the other reviews, you'll know that ""Sex and Sunsets"" is about a weird guy (Kelly Palomino) who falls in love with a stranger on her wedding day (Colette) and pursues her doggedly even though she is married and he doesn't know her at all. His persistence slowly chips away at her resolve for reasons never fully explained, and the reader is left confused and a bit disturbed at the outcome. The narrative style is casual and a bit irritating, and parts of the characters' psyches (like Kelly hearing voices in water) are not dealt with at all. This book seems like a rough draft, not a finished novel."
1,Why all of the hype?,"People seem to love this book or hate it. The general consensus seems to be that Tim Sandlin is not to be compared with Salinger or Dostoevsky. I agree wholeheartedly. I would not call this ""light"" reading, it is more on the vapid side. But I do think it is serious when a man is portrayed as a stalker who eventually wins over his victim. I just don't see the point of an unbelievable story like this. It is insulting to my intelligence."
4,A Pleasant Marriage-of-Convenience Story,"Book Description: A suitable wife? Emma had spent most of her life looking after other people, so it was quite a shock to meet a man so determined to take care of her. Sir Paul Wyatt's proposal -- even if it was motivated by convenience on his part -- was hardly one that Emma was in a position to refuse. Could this renowned surgeon be the answer to all her dreams?While not one of my favorite, this is an enjoyable marriage of convenience story. I liked Paul and that we are allowed to see that he cares for her early on, but found Diana more than a little irritating. Although others may not agree, I much preferred An Unlikely Romance, The Bachelor's Wedding, The Vicar's Daughter, and others of her MOC stories. That said, this is another story any Neels fan will enjoy."
3,BACK COVER OF BOOK,"A suitable wife? Emma? Emma Trent had sepent most of her life looking after other people, so it was a shock to encounter a man so determined to take care of her - Sir Paul Wyatt was fast becoming her very own guardian angel! She was hardly in a position to turn down his proposal of marriage,, even if it was motivated by convenience on his part. With her plain looks and practical nature, Emma knew her limitations, but longed for children of her own. Could the eminent surgeon be the answer to all her dreams?....."
5,I wish I could give more then 5 stars,"This is the best idea ever. I have many pots for loose tea and make tea every day. I have used ""bags"" to put loose tea in and balls to hold loose tea or a pot with a filter in the middle, I've used a small filter that sits on top of my cup but nothing works near as well, and is as convenient as this pot. You put the loose tea and boiling water in the pot and after it has steeped you place the pot on top of your cup, the tea drips into the cup because the rim of the cup presses it's valve.It is the simplest way to make loose tea that I know of. A uniquie gift idea. I plan on getting one for all my tea drinking friends. Christmas shopping is going to be easy this year."
1,Crap Control Even Worst Flow,This could have been such an awesome game. The camera controls are the worst since Pirates of the Caribbean. I found myself fighting camera angles more then crimals. How did this ever get out of beta?? Sucky game flow and some mega boring missions. Save your money. Wait until this goes into the dollar stores. Then you over paid by 78 cents.
5,Indispensable,"Remarkable music. First, there is Meldhau's rendition of ""All The Things You Are"", a standard in the jazz canon which is often used, as a consequence of its difficult changes, to test a young phenom's musical mettle. Suffice to say that Meldhau meets the challenge head-on and rewrites the book on this thorny chestnut! Second in significance, is an extended piece entitled ""Nice Pass"", which showcases virtually every facet of Meldhau's breathtaking improvisational artistry and highlights the stunning support provided by Larry Grenadier on bass and Jorge Rossy on drums. Meldhau's extended comments on the CD insert provide an interesting insight into his musical philosophy. All in all, an absolutely indispensable CD!"
3,He's Done Better Work,"Brad Mehldau is a truly gifted musician, but this album doesn't show it. Could be he's just trying too hard to get into something new. This work feels a little too ""pushed"" for me. I like most of his older work a whole lot better. This album is mostly interesting for keeping up with one of our better artists."
5,Fab brush,"I liked this brush so much I had to replace it when it wore out. The first one lasted a long time, and I'm pretty rough on my brushes. I recommend it for anyone with frizzy, fly away hair."
5,Great product,"This is a great product, no static. I have had several brushes but nothing like this. This is my third time purchasing the same brush. I even purchased one for my sister."
5,brilliant,"I liked the debut joshua croft novel ""wall of glass"" but i loved the 2nd, ""at ease with the dead"".. I've just ordered 2 more in the series on the strength of the 2nd. having been through NM and Texas many times I found the flavor just right.. a bit of simple working class style as opposed to many more high society style story tellers.. as a martial artist I found the palm strike surprising and totally convincing (sorry don't want to be a spoiler) and even more the touch of remorse about it at the end.. joshua is tough but not macho.. he's down to earth and isn't proud of taking lives.. he's a real man not an ego-strutting super hero.. anyway I'm a big fan of satterthwait cause he's the same as johua: not pretentious with his language, he's down to earth.. very refreshing :-)"
1,Heaven Speaks,"This is a 4-page pamphlet that I bought for $9.00. It was listed as a ""paperback"" in the book category. I have several of Frances Klug's books which this is not. Her ""books"" are usually over 200 pages."
2,Sister of Darkness,"Sister of Darkness is basically the life story of the author, Lili Bita, a Greek woman. Sister of Darkness is written in a very difficult way to read. Lili Bita uses a very complex vocabulary to write this book. She writes extremely with many details, which makes the novel very boring. The story is written in a chronological order since she was born in the Island until she left Tasos forever, when she finds freedom. How sad is Lili's life as Tasos's wife. She was happy, until she destroyed her life falling in love with Tasos. Lili Bita is always looking for freedom in her life; however, she can not find it, because of a war and then a cruel marriage. After she left Tasos forever, which is the only part of the novel I liked, she could find herself free of violence. Anyway, we can find a tough woman, despite these circumstances. I would give this story 2 out of 5 stars, because it never kept my interest."
4,Sister of Darkness,"The book of Sister of Darkness is Lili Bita's memoir. Lili Bita is a Greek woman who searches deep in her emotions looking for answers to many of the questions that came into her life. Her memoir describes every detail of her childhood and adulthood. This woman was raised by a strict mother and father who believed in rules and those rules could never be broken. She is supposed to be a perfect girl by playing the piano and behaving like a doll. Born into a religious family, she is punished for breaking the rules, without any exception. Lili Bita was always a strong person; many times she was a rebel. She decided to go to Athens to attend school, where she discovers of sex, love, anger and all kinds of emotions. She acted like any other teenager who had a strict family background. After moving to a big city she began to experiment with sex and relationships. The memoir is interesting because it describes female's point of view in her intimate life, sex, romance and love."
4,Sister of Darkness - Lili Bita,"In Lili Bita's, Sister of Darkness, Lili proves to both men and women, that even as a female you can stand up for yourself and have a mind of your own. I can relate to her in the way that her parents had her life planned out for her as my parents have mine. Just as Lili, I will do whatever I need so that I can have my freedom. No matter what her parents said to her she had her own opinion and they didnt influence her.As far as the reading goes, she is extremely descriptive. It was sort of difficult to read at first; My attention kept going elsewhere. However, after a few pages I really started to get into it and understand her writing style. She wants to see the picture exactly how it really was.I think Lili Bita is a great writer but probably not for everyone. If you're not very open-minded, this most likely isnt the book for you. If you can handle other lifestyles besides the one you live, read on!"
1,Im not sure how anyone can enjoy this,"i saw this band live last night, and was NOT impressed. i love metal (real metal, too), but this stuff is not music. it's just a bunch of screaming over pointless noise. i can get into converge, and even some dillinger escape plan, but there comes a point where it crosses over from being insane/complex music to pure noise. this band has crossed that point."
2,Alpha Video Cheats Us Again,"Once again, it's an Alpha Video Release. Rare Tex Ritter films that have been altered. Music cues and sound effects such as the sound of broken glass has been added to the sounttrack. Why they do this I do not know. I suspect Alpha wants to ""brand"" the movies and lay claim they own them. I like old cowboy westerns but to discover they freeze frame screens, add their logo in the corner of the screen and then add sound effects to the sound track (and the sound effects stand out very clearly, it's very distracting) is too much to bare. This is why I try to avoid anything manufactured by Alpha Video. (Besides, they probably got their films from VHS videos bought at the flea market. It's the kind of quality they offer on their DVDs.)"
2,Warning: Contents REALLY Tepid!,"Boy, Playboy have a bit of a nerve putting out things like this. From a magazine that is famous for depicting beautiful naked women there is a noticeable lack of them in this DVD! It basically contains interviews with the ten girls and a documentary about their photoshoots. About the only nudity is half-second cut-overs to the still pictures that we have already seen in the magazine. This is a real shame because some of them appear to be very nice indeed. If you are interested in hearing why a 'beautiful barista' wants to appear in Playboy buy it - otherwise save your money."
3,Dull and lifeless,"I guess the content is decent enough, if you like a dull lifeless book with fine print and no color photo's (just little black dots to represent stars, UG!). If you're like me and love large color photo's and nice glossy pages then GET ""The Backyard Astronomer's Guide"". Afterall don't we look at the stars because we love the physical beauty of it, well The Backyard Astronomer's Guide has this book beat 100 fold in that regard. Since you can't preview the pages of this book I want to save other unsuspecting victims from making the same mistake I did, wish one of the other reviewers would of steered me straight!"
1,Unapproved 2nd edition,"This 2nd edition was edited and published without the consent of the original author (Crossen), because of a dispute with the publisher over an unrelated work published elsewhere. According to Crossen, the updates were sloppy added with other parts altered, in any case done without the author's consent.If you plan to buy this book, get the original first edition."
2,Nothing like the rest of his work,"I've read all of Bateman's work, and this is the palest of the pale. Takes much longer to get into, and you're left with a disappointing taste in your mouth after the investment put into getting through it. I'm always entertained by the randomness inherent in Bateman's work, but in this one, much more so than the others, the randomness is used to cover bad plot holes and lacklustre characters. If you're reading chronoligically, skip over this one and come back to it when you wistfully realize there's nothing more available (yet!). If you're looking for ""good"" bateman, look for Divorcing Jack or Empire State, give this one a miss."
4,Fun to watch,Bought as Christmas present for husband of Scot ancestry. He loves bagpipes. I tolerate bagpipes from a distance. They are too loud for me. We both did enjoy the DVD very much. Wish they had done some more rock pieces though. They were fun to watch and we enjoyed the interviews. The camera work was not always very good but enjoyed it anyway.
4,like bag pipe music?,If you like bagpipie music this may be a band that you want to look into. They have DVDs and cds out and its varied music from most generations. Look for them on YouTube before you buy and see what you think. I never thought of putting tiny microphones on the ends of bagpippes but its sounds great.
1,don't even think about it,Product clogged print head on Sytlus Color 800. Dozens of cleaning cycles did not correct problemHad to purchase Epson cartidge and perform several cleanings to make printer functional.
5,Idiomatic American English,"Great, good explanations, exercises, easy to understand layout, & convenient to teach idioms to ESL students cuz the info is all on one page for easy xeroxing. Many of my students loved the book enough to buy a copy for themselves to study at home."
5,ziripot,I have liked it very much. All the idiomatics are easyly and clearley explained. Exercises are easy and does not take many time to learn idiomatics every day.
4,"Delightful Language, Horrific Story","Hardy spares us the gruesome details of the worst offenses in this novel, yet the overall portrait of genuine goodness utterly defeated at the hands of the cruel world is enough to cause the most stable person to contemplate self-destruction. A horrific tragedy. I can't decide whether I am glad or sorry that I read it."
4,Tess of the D'Urbevilles,"'Tess of the D'Urvevilles' is regarded, by many, to be Hardy's best novel. At the time it was published, in the 1890's, it was surrounded by controversy due to its themes of apostasy and sexual immorality.It is a tragedy, that Hardy compares to Aeschylus' tragedies, in which Tess Durbyfield, a Wessex 'cottage girl', embarks upon a journey through seduction and rape, love, morality, internal religious struggle, until she finally meets her fate. Hardy was commenting on the society he lived in and the attitudes and values that it adopted.A fascinating read, if you like Hardy's style and can make sense of his often complicated lexical choices."
1,Disappointing--lacking in context and careful research,"A recent article in the San Francisco Daily Journal (a respected legal journal)by Karen Coleman describes this book as ""a compilation of student essays...the book paints an unadmiring portrait of the defenders of affirmative action at Boalt."" _The Diversity Hoax_ does not contribute, in a meaningful way, to the national conversation that is heating up as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on the Michigan cases. Instead this book expends its energy on a shallow attack against ""defenders of affirmative action""...failing to inform readers about the deeper issues of the affirmative action debate.To better understand this important national issue, people should read more informed sources such as _Silence at Boalt Hall: The Dismantling of Affirmative Action_, which does give history and context as well as a personal account."
1,Tedious Accounts of Law School Not Reality,"As a white woman who shared the classroom with these authors, I am again saddened at what is so painfully obvious throughout this text. How desparately threatening is the idea that a student may have to endure and co-exist with ideas completely opposed to their own and not feel empowered to express themselves!!. How horrible it must have been for these authors to have felt ""silenced""! These notions I found to be unengaging and ill founded. The accounts are so uninteresting maybe there is good reason why their views weren't valued in classroom discussions."
5,Tour de Force of the Dilemma that Bedevils Elite Law School,"A lucid, well-written and concise exploration into the styfling intellectual environment at one of America's top law schools, UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall. These student-written essays--in which many of the authors self-identify as liberals--are replete with anecdotal and factually verifiable stories of the systematic oppression of free speech which ironically takes place at the epicenter of the free speech movement of the 1960s, UC Berkeley. These essays not only expose the slanderous tactics of the student left, but also advocate a more modern and progressive concept of ""diversity,"" one in which ideas are adjudged based on their content regardless of the speaker's skin tone.A must read."
4,partea on,"The product works as advertised. However, they size of the container should be a few ounces larger. Because of the space the tea takes up in the container you do not get 2 full cups of tea. Beyond that though it's a great product."
2,1940's porn,This is truely a classic in the pornography industry. This is set in the late 1940's early 1950's and has the old school music to the non verbal flicks. It is a good picture to anyone who is into the early films of erotica. It is a truely strange experience to have watched this. Needless to say that it was nothing like I expected.
4,This bear Has Bite! Ouch!,"Part of the 70s nature run amok flicks, this is one of the best. It seems that a big ole bear is eating unhappy campers in the woods. Nearly a decade before seeing a hockey mask in the woods was not a good thing, this bear struck terror in the campers. I was a little kid when I saw this movie, and it always scarred me to go to Grandma's because she lived up in the mountains in the deep woods. Watching it as an adult it still has some chills and yes even more laughs. Good acting, and very fast pacing keep this film moving."
2,Just How Much Can One Bear ah err Bare,"If you go down to the woods today, you better run like hell cause some joker in a shoddy bear costume is scaring the heck out of actors in there. What can one say about a film that was made to purely cash in on the Jaws craze. The bear attacks are quite good but it is still a cheap tacky film and it doesn't for one second recover from this fact.So if you are collecting animal attack films by all means buy this, everyone else buy the Yogi Bear Collection, he's a much nicer, smarter than the average bear.This film is a pure boo-boo."
3,Classic Drive - In Movie,"I first saw this movie when I was about 5 yrs old at a local Drive-in. I had not seen it in many years until now. It definitly looks dated. The plot , music , actors all very 70's. The ending is a bit anti-climatic. But if your'e looking for a nostalgic blast from the past and don't want to think too hard I think you'll enjoy Grizzly."
