3,Good if you trim hair first,This is O.K. if you trim the hair first wherever you're shaving. You can use it in the shower with shaving cream.
3,"Ok for looking smooth, not for being smooth.","For me this thing works ok for the tender bits, but not for much else. It shaves most of my hair just not that close. I'll keep using it but I won't be getting rid of my razor any time soon."
3,"Shaves okay, but boy did I get a rash after!","This thing is nice because it is waterproof and lets you shave everywhere, as it says. I got a terrible rash after shaving some previously un-shaved parts. I don't think it's the razor's fault though."
4,"Not bad, but...","it does what they say, but for the price should have an adjustable head as opposed to clip on length attatchments. It still ""bit"" my skin a little."
4,Great groomer. Use together with a razor.,"This product is very useful for getting rid of unwanted hair below the neckline.It is particularly useful when cutting longer hair. You can safely press it firmlyagainst the skin without hurting yourself. When you learn how to use it a littlebit, you'll be able to cut the hair very short.The finish will not be quite 'baby smooth', however. In fact, I use this productto prepare for a razor shave which will then only require a few strokes to getthe desired smoothness."
1,This thing is a toy,"I just got this item (Norelco's on-line ad suggests that they understand very well what men are looking for), but they got it wrong somewhere along the line. This thing grabs, pulls and doesn't cut well at all (although it did charge quickly). I will soon be buying something more professional. Don't waste your time and money on this."
2,Be prepared to spend lots of time shaving,This product looks great and keeps a very good charge. Other than that it is pure frustration. The angle of the head in relation to the handle makes it very difficult to do the back of you legs. It requires multiple and I mean multiple passes to give a reasonably clean shave. If you have not shaved in a while you would need to use a trimmer first before using this. Really not worth the money.
1,"Terrible shaver, slow, missed spots, waste of money","This is just a terrible shaver. I bought it primarily for my stomach, chest and under arms. It is really slow. I had to go over the same body area 5-10 times, really slowly in order for it to cut all the hair. On areas such as my stomach it wasn't too bad since the skin there is smooth but on areas like under arms or the chest area it was a nightmare. It barely cut the hair, took for ever and left a stubble. Not very smooth. Before when I used a manual razor, it took me around 3 minutes to shave my stomach and chest and with this electric shaver, it took like 10 minutes and it was nowhere as close as with the manual shaver.After 3 weeks I called Philips and told them I wanted to return it. I got the 45-day money back guarantee form and I will drop off the shaver in the mail tomorrow."
2,not all it's cracked up to be,"I'm still learning to use it I guess, but it just doesn't live up to the billing. I won't go as far as to say it doesn't ""work"" b/c it does cut...but it doesn't cut on one pass...you have to make multiple passes over the same spot to achieve any sort of trimming.Like I said, I'm still learning...as I'm not a usual electric razor user. If I have an operational breakthrough I will share."
4,norelco body shaver review,"no disappointments with this body groomer.easy to use,light weight and no elect cords to deal with."
1,Absolute Junk!!,"Frankly I'm dumbfounded by the positive reviews here. This was pure flimsy plastic junk and I just returned it. It didn't work for me at all. It shaved about 10% of what I asked it to, and no matter how many times I went over certain spots this thing could not hack it. Also, according to the cheaply done instructions, it can be overcharged if you don't unplug it. Hello? What year is this? A little more sophistication please! I suppose if you are accustomed to shoddy poorly made products you'll find this thing acceptable. Definitely one to avoid."
2,This thing needs Viagra,"I've had this for over a year now and it worked pretty well in the beginning. Now, as other reviewers have said, the metal razor part that is supposed to pop out for cleaning will not just pop out on its own while in use. A couple times the device wouldn't turn off and the only way I could get it to turn off was banging it on the bathroom counter until something lodged back into place. Worst of all though, the motor has lost its umph. Since it has lost much of its power, it takes several passes to shave anything and you dare not allow too much hair in at once - or it starts pulling!So, you can buy it if you need one immediately for some hot date and the store isn't selling anything else. But, it will probably not last very long."
3,OK If You Have Lots of Time,"My first complaint about this shaver is that it does not cut well if the body hair lies down on the body. It takes several passes from different directions to do an acceptable job. The second complaint is that if the body hair has any length at all, it is necessary to frequently stop to clear the hair out of the cutting area. Otherwise it will not cut. Blowing on it sometimes works but usually I have to remove the guide and flick it out with a toothpick of something comparable. My third complaint is that the battery is kaput after two years of use and it is probably not cost effective to have it replaced. I am generous in giving it a three star rating."
3,Ehhh ok...,"When i first got this product I was stoked! But then i realized it was and OK.. body groomer, well for me anyways. I am a harrier guy and the this groomer is pretty good at trimming leg hair, bad thing is that is can nick&pull and it has to be cleaned every couple seconds. The Junk.. yea I wouldn't do that, nicked myself once around there and i was like.. No thanks. Could be a good product for men who are not as hairy, but for the others i would recommend a better body groomer."
1,Do not waste your money!!!,do not buy!!! Metal screen pops loose. A Nightmare. Find something else. It is not worth the money. Find another product. A razor would be better choice.
4,Good buy.,This product is like super good.it's perfect for grooming those parts down there.plus it doesn't irritate my skin either.the battery life is pretty good on it also.
1,Worst product I have ever purchased at Amazon,"I've been buying products from Amazon for the last 10+ years. This has to be the worst product I have ever purchased in my life. I truly believe either 1) I got a defective product or 2) All these positive reviews are made up. I followed all the instructions carefully but this thing is just BAD. Philip Norelco should be ashamed to produce such a bad product. I tried it on my arm with guid comb #3, not a single hair was cut. Tried it with comb #2, nothing, Tried it with comb #1 and maybe cut about 1/10000 of a millimeter, I could hear it was cutting something but visually no difference at all. I tried it bare, no combs and finally started to work but this thing pulled and tugged my hair to a very unpleasant experience. After trying to make it work for 30 minutes I gave up. There has to be something better than this. This should be at the $1 bin at Walmart.Skip all together!!!"
4,Gets the job done,"Does what I need it to do, which is trim my nether regions. After 4 years my first one malfunctioned and I couldn't turn it off. So I bought the same one."
1,Cheap,Not good for anything. Pulls hair; doesn't cut it. Not sharp enough or powerful enough. Couldn't find anything useful for it.
1,HAte it,I was hoping this razor would be great since I Love my T780 but this groomer was awful and left my disappointed.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I was impressed with the price of the shaver, and it was working well when I first used it. Unfortunately I found that the top is extremely flimsy, and the blade falls out all the time. It's actually difficult to change clip-sizes without pulling the whole top off. Other reviewers had the exact same problem as me which is how I know it isn't just mine that's defective. Even if it's cheap for a razor, I know I definitely could've gotten more for the money."
3,Okay...Not Great.,"If you want to shave all the way down to the skin, this does a fairly nice job - as nice as you could expect without using an actual razor. If that's what you want it for, then I recommend this product.However, once you place the attachments on this thing, it becomes completely worthless! My arms are pretty hairy and I wanted to trim them down, but not completely shave them bare. This thing couldn't even handle that job with the attachments on. If you just want to trim body hair back without shaving it completely off, you'd be better off paying $15 for cheap set of ConAir clippers. Just don't try to take those into the shower!"
1,bad design,"Not recommended, bad design, waste of money, Hair clogs instantly when you start using.How can a company that designs these stuff, not know about simple defect in design."
2,Barely does the job,A primitive contrivance that struggles to shave the body uniformly without discomfort and scars. Many areas require me to reshave using my fantastic Panasonic Vortex (which was not designed for body shaving).
1,no adjustable trimmer!,it's a total waste. the most basic feature of any body groomer would be to have an adjustable guard over the trimmer so the user can determine a safe or desirable length. the norelco does not have one. the three clip on/fall off guards have preset lengths and are useless.the vidal sassoon vscl820 has a flimsy and ineffective trimmer design but managed to design a great handle extension for shaving the back.the remington bht-2000 is light years ahead of both the norelco and vidal sassoon.
1,A regular shaver that will cut you in the places its says it won't,"When I took this product out of the box I examined it, curious to what design differences set it apart from other electric shavers such that it wouldn't nick and cut one in the sensitive areas it is advertised for. I couldn't discern any and after using it, and being cut twice (I stopped after the second time), I can tell you there are none. Its just an electric shaver. Nothing special or noteworthy other than the advertising. Philips Norelco ought to be the subject of a class action suit for false advertising and personal injury."
4,Not bad - gets the job done,"Prior to having this bodygroomer, I would just use my regular electric shaver down there and more often than not I would get a knick or cut. I had seen this product in the stores and was interested in trying so I decided to purchase it here.It works exceptionally well on the testicles and taint - gets it extremely smooth which is what I wanted. The attachments are good for the area above the shaft where you still want some hair and not totally smooth. However, I find the attachments a bit hard to remove once you snap them on. I like how ergonomic the handle is - makes it easy to go back and forth in a variety of different angles.This groomer also works well for the little bit of hair that I have on my chest and trim my arm pits. I would've never expected trimming my armpits would be so satisfying - I've noticed a huge difference when I work out and that I don't feel nearly as sweaty there because the hair is now shorter."
4,GOOD PRODUCT!!!! I am sure there is better for a higher price!!,"I unfortunately have the problem of a lot of body hair, which led me to this product! It is a perfect shaver for trimming the neckline real quick! It is also a great addition if you are looking to trim your ummm.... behind... Other than that it does not trim thick bunch of long hair very well. For other areas you are probably better off sticking with a razor (it is quicker however not safer)! The only reason why this product does not receive 5 stars is because I would like a body trimmer to work well for all of my body hair needs. All in all this product was the perfect addition to my hair trimming tools."
4,easy to us and can reach almost all areas,can shave all of my private region fairly smooth. got sensitive skin snagged once. head needs to be a little smaller for rear crack. overall i recommend for armpits trimming and private.
1,does not cut hairs,I have long fine hair on my back.This shaver does not cut this hair.I rub it over my upper back and lower back as best as I can. Very little hair is cut. I've given up on using it.Since this product does not fulfill it's purpose I will stop this review here. No biography necessary.
3,"Product as expected, but okay enough","Based on other reviews I was expecting a product with flaws. 3 of the 4 cannons were broken on arrival, and one man was headless. I expect that glue will solve this problem. My son is still happy with the set though he wished it would was a bit more durable. My son also wanted to mention that there were 2 general Cornwallis'."
2,Broken Pieces when we opened the box :(,While the box had great educational information on it and the soldiers were historically accurate and interesting to my 7 year old. All but one of the cannons came with the wheels broken off. They are loose in this big box and easily damaged so do not expect to receive this product in good condition after shipping.
3,"not for kid with no imagination, mediocre quality","This toy is good for the kid who knows something about history, enough to recreate his or her own battles. The quality is only so so, and one of the three cannons was broken upon receipt. It is a hassle to return or exchange goods through mail. The pieces are one-colored, i.e., not super detailed (but that was expected due to the price being pretty low for the set)."
5,1959 Plymouth Carb Kit,"Though not listed as such, this is the correct rebuild kit for a 1959 Plymouth, 2bbl Carter carburetor. It has all the necessary parts to restore your carburetor to like new running condition. The instructions are not very detailed, but these carburetors are pretty simple, and should be no problem for anyone with a little mechanical know how."
5,A very complete reference book,"I really liked this one. It is compact, the sections are quite complete and it is easy to use for any occasion."
2,Poor condition,"When I received this book it was in a condition worse than I expected. I don't mind some wear and tear, but many of the pages were folded down and there was profanity written on some of the pages along with other pen markings. Fortunately the swear words were in pencil instead of pen so I erased them as much as possible."
2,"informative, but not too user friendly","This book has a lot of interesting trivia, however as far as finding the answers to the questions it is very confusing. I've been interested in trivia books for quite awhile and I found this one to be the most frustrating to work with. It's really a shame since there is really quite a bit of fun information and trivia."
2,The Anthropology of Media: A Reader (Blackwell Readers in Anthropology) (Purchased on 09/26/2009) by Kelly Askew,"The book came on time, that I appreciate-- but within a week the first chapter had ripped out of the binding! By the end of the semester the thing will surely be in pieces."
2,This is ok,"This book is very nice and all but there is only one page each for the 1st . 2nd , and 3rd birthday and there are no lines to right on in the book only on some pages. So this book wasnt worth what i payed for it."
3,quality needs improving,The print color is too light - rather grey than black. Harder to read.Can not stay open on music stand by itself.
5,Great Speakers!!,The Panasonic detachable speakers are great they are the same ones that were offerd for sale when i got my 42intv but at 598.95 price. Great price!
1,Map of Savannah GA,Upset that you couldn't see the map on the inside where the streets are before ordering. Cannot use the map at all. It is not a real street map but just highlights of tourist places. I am new to Savannah and needed a street by street view.
2,THE PRICE IS WRONG,"The information included in this map can be easily accessed with any of the free maps available throughout the city. These maps include popular landmarks and squares.The city is conveniently laid out in a straight north/south and east/west grid, so it's hard to get lost. To find a specific business it't easy to explore (or see the yellow pages).At one third to one half the price, i might recommend it, but with the grade school graphics and the above shortcomings i cannot."
2,Disappointed,"The Best Little Map of Savannah, GA.Was very disappointed in the map did not show all that I was looking for got a better one thru AAA free."
1,Very disappointed,"I am very disappointed in this map. We had hoped to use it on a trip to Savannah for our niece's wedding. We wanted to locate the wedding site and the reception site and the nearby hotels. This map shows the shops of the historic district and gives oversight maps of some of the neighboring areas, Midtown, Southside but there is no detail. It does not identify where Midtown and Southside are in relation to the historic district. Do not buy this as a map in planning a visit. Maybe a cute reminder of where you went in Savannah.The Best Little Map of Savannah, GA."
3,Some interesting articles,"Lacity and Hirschheim's outsourcing chapter really stands out. The chapter on structuration theory is terrible, but that's because structuration theory itself is terrible."
3,"Great concept, great franchise","Bob, I love your programs and your energy. I think just about everything you do is awesome! This book however isn't much more than a lab journal. It has us write down food/exercise like we are a science experiement. It is a lot like a lined paper notebook.I got a lot more out of LifeChanger. Your exercise program, coupled with this self discovery tool enabled me to lose 185 pounds! I recommend every buys ALL of Bob Greene's other books, but pass on this one and get yourself LifeChanger instead! I found mine on eDiets.com's store."
4,Great Place to Track your progress,"I like the format of this journal. You can track exercise, food intake, alcohol, fat and sugar along with writing your thoughts and specific food if you so desire. The only thing that I do not like is his use of the term ""Bad Carbohydrates."" I hate the whole good food vs. bad food terminology and think that it promotes some unhealthy food issues."
5,A book for the executive heart and spirit,"Exactly what is called for in these extraordinarily challenging times...a corporate shaman. With layoffs, acquisitions, dramatically devalued pension funds, and the post 9-11 loneliness and pain, our organizations today and the people in them have taken some serious blows to their spirit. And what makes more sense to deal with this wounding than one who has been trained through the millennia to do exactly that. This is the corporate shaman. An exciting and powerfully relevant read for anyone who works."
1,Ross' 'evidence' not very convincing,"This book is almost a case study of paranoia, if indeed theauthor really believes what he says, which I doubt. Evidenceis of a nature that virtually anything can be proven about anything. Don't waste your money on this piece of utter nonsense.As to JFK, the fact is that Oswald was aiming at Connelly, not Kennedy, but wasn't experienced at leading his target. Case closed."
2,Severly Modified,"I was very disappointed with A Night at the Met. I use to own this on VHS tape. Since I am commuting now in my car, I decided to buy this album, because I loved the routine. Unfortunately, the best parts of the comic performance have been edited out of the CD version of Robin Williams' performance. Most noticeable to me was the bit about marijuana and the cat, which is sadly missing. I was really hoping to relieve the performance I had watched many times, but sadly, due to the editing of this CDs, it will most likely be shelved."
4,Robin Williams night at the met,"I really enjoyed watching Robbin Williams in concert, I think he is a very funny comedian and an excellent actor."
4,Hardcore Indeed,"If one is serious about becoming more knowledgeable about self-defence, this is one book which should be on your short-list. No, there are no photos and diagrams in this text; however, the book contains a ton of must-know information. This book hammers home the point that self-defence is no game. There is absolutely nothing glamorous about violence - it isn't pretty. To defend yourself successfully, you must act quickly and decisively. In addition you must be prepared to use brutal techniques if fleeing isn't an option or you can't talk your way out of a situation. If you don't have the right mind-set you're going to be put in the hurt locker by some thug or some thug and his buddies. I don't think this book is the last word on self-defence nor do I agree with the author on every point - but it is worth the money. I enjoyed reading this book and I believe you will as well."
4,Open Your Eyes,"This small book deserves merit as brain food for the martial artist. You don't have time to be scarred in a fight or to figure out what you are going to do once a fight starts. When you are attacked you will respond according to the very way you train today. Your luck depends on being prepared and being ready to respond appropriately, and the chapter on mental preparation may just save your life! I only gave 4 stars because he didn't have any photos, but the squimish will do good to read it without photos.Train hard and have fun!Guro Dennis Servaes"
2,False Belief!,"Too martial arty for one. Second is everyday people will find this book a complete turn off. It should be titled ""For Street Fighters Only!""Way over the head on the everyday person and put in the wrong hands, like a teenager, could get them hurt with false belief in the information provided in the book.One must understand that no book can teach mindset or technique and a true combative goes through real training.In all fairness to the author their is much worst on the market."
1,Not worth the purchase,"There's not much meat here, and certainly no techniques or pictures of any techniques. if you need a book to tell you to inflict as much damage as possible, you'll find that in dozens of other books. The section about using a belt as a weapon is somewhat useful. Other than that, this is not a very helpful book."
1,Sold me bad film,"I am extremely disappointed and angry that I bought a 2 pack of Polaroid film from this seller. The film had an expiration date of 2000 on it and had an awful smell to it, and as a result, the pictures I took did not develop at all. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER. It was a complete waste of money. Seller is a crook."
1,EXPIRED PRODUCT,Expired film!! Wasted my money!! Ruined my christmas party cause I planned on using them. Thanks for nothing. Very dissatisfied!
4,Industry Statistician,"I think this is a very good text, and when used in combination with Pepe's text, you get all the statistical background you would need to design well thought out studies, and account for bias."
1,For Nyima Gejie fans only!,"If you're looking to expand your practice with an inspirational rendition of the mantras keep looking(or try Mantras fro Tibet OM TARA By Sarva-Antah). I was hoping this CD would strengthen my practice by inspiring me through an appreciatiion and celebration of the beauty of harmony and the human voice. Though this CD is a very heartfelt repetition, it's musically quite painful."
2,Roxio Tech support,"The install went good, I burnt a couple CD's and all is well until I tried to make a slide show in DVD builder. After working a couple minutes the program locked up, losing my work and making me reboot. I went thru that many times. After doing all updates on the PC video drivers, sound card and every other thing I could possibly update I tried to call tech support. What a joke.After three tries being on hold over 45 minutes and then loosing the connection each time I tried e-mail mailing, never did get a response back. Went to the support web sights and I see I'm not the only one that has been having problems.Finally after a week of frustration and my deadline only a week away I ordered Pro Show Gold which is only a DVD builder but what a pleasure to use, not a single problem and is so user friendly.Next I'm going to order Nero, read many good reviews on that software.This softeware may be alright if you had some support to get you up and running."
1,Roxio Media creator 9,"Have had this for about a year. Made one dvd movie. Have had nothing but problems, C ++ errors etc. Roxio support gives me the same fixes over and over. Nothing worked, Very frustrating, very poor customer support. This error is very common and they don't seem to care"
3,Handy but incredibly overpriced,"I do a lot of traveling for sales and this is a great desk, with non-slip grip on top, for laptop, iPad work area.If you brake normally and even quickly, the grip really grabs.Easily sits in my Prius passenger seat ( seat has to be ALL the way back to clear the dashboard ). It's basically an injected molded plasticthat should be priced more around 69.95 for all that it is. The storage slots on top are deep enough for a few hanging files and triple compartment for pens, calc, cords, etc. It would be nice if there were custom inserts for the compartment so you could customize it to your needs for accessories."
1,Lost in Space,"Sorry, This one is the only Kenny Loggins disk that was a complete let down. This one lacked or did not reflect Kenny's true feelings like all the others do. This ones cold and lost. Save some cash, or better yet, get any other Loggins or Loggins & Messina disk, You'll thank me later."
1,SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED THANKSGIVING DAY...,"What an enormous turkey this is! Why this wasn't a career ending album is beyond me. Uninspired writing, singing and playing highlight every track. The whole thing sounds like it came straight out of the can. Good news, no live musicians were used in the making of this disaster."
2,Late 80s' Loggins,"The 1988 album Back To Avalon by Kenny Loggins contains 2 movie theme songs that reached the top 20; one is Nobody's Fool, from Caddyshack II, while the other one is Meet Me Halfway, from Over The Top. It also includes a duet with Michael McDonald (She's Dangerous) and a swooping title track, arguably the album's strongest piece. Unfortunately, the album missed certification just as his previous Vox Humana; a distraught Kenny Loggins due to a crumbling marriage, a slick, synth-heavy, and unequivocally dated late 80s' production that suffocate the compositions, and the overall change in public perceptions at the time are all factors that contributed to its lack of success."
4,Wicca'dly witty guide to truly practical magick,"This is a terrific book for any kitchen witch. The spell recipes are easy to follow, using fairly common household ingredients, and written with wit. Particularly helpful for urban witches who are without access to difficult to find Craft specialty items."
4,Only if you're in a hurry,"This book is really small, so it's easy for you to carry around in your handbag when you go shopping at the supermarket.The spells found inside are very simple & there are brief explainations to each of the ingredients listed for each spell (helps you make your own spells better later)."
4,Very convienient,"I have to say that I had a hard time dropping almost $9 for such a small book. I bought the book on a lunch break and came back, one of my non-pagan coworkers looked thru it and her response was ""wow, you can just use the stuff that's in your cupboards..."" That's the beauty of it, although being able to use essential oils, powders, herbs and etc is nice, but not so nice on the pocket book. And the stuff that you have already is just as effective. It has already come in handy. I didn't give it the full 5 stars because it was a little pricey, but I can't complain because I bought it anyway"
3,Average,These work ok. Just ok. There are better filters at lower prices. A little pricey for the quality.
4,Prince Charming-maybe,"Finally a book about JFK Jr. that shows he was a flawed human being just like the rest of us. Yes, he was a great guy, but he was also moody. His marriage was so-so, like everyone else's. It seems that John had a blind streak when it came to men and philandering-what a surprise! Imagine a Kennedy male with antiquated notions regarding woman. Guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.American Son also showed how JFK Jr. tried to break away from the mold-without much success. He claimed to be a normal New Yorker-no bodyguards. Bt most people I know in NYC don't have co workers running interference to protect their privacy.At the end of the day he was a decent guy-flaws and all."
3,Nicely done....,"From the newspaper hype about Caroline Kennedy being so upset about this book, I expected something sleazy or at least derogatory....nothing such! This was a look at a human being, nothing salacious, nothing critical. It was interesting to read about the man, rather than the persona. The treatment of Carolyn was also upbeat, again nothing salacious and nothing critical. I don't understand the problem here!"
4,Its Not a Hatchet Job,"The way some people have been reacting to this book, including the Kennedys, you would think this is a hateful, venom spewing tell-all on John Kennedy Jr. It is not.Its obvious Blow liked John, and his book is very fair. I think it makes John look good, not bad. I don't think he was demonizing Carolyn either. He was just honest about his recollections. When did honesty become a crime? I especially found the last half of the book very interesting. So Richard Blow wrote a book about working with and knowing John Kennedy Jr. More power to him."
4,A good read,"Easy reading,gentle telling--Richard Blow did a good job.Their is no character assination nor drip-drap story telling. Mr. Blow told the events as they took place--no heavy interruption on the authors part.I agree, he liked John Kennedy and respected Carolyn.Thank you to the author for writing in good taste. We the public needed alittle of John and Carolyn after their tragic parting of our world. The book was perfect in many aspects . No fault bearing here. Leave the author alone . And thank Richard."
3,Another Friend Cashes In,"Excellent book. I like reading about the Kennedy's too, I admit and I liked this book, because it did not trash his wife. Poor Carolyn, her so-called friends (Rob Little,Bill Noonan)all wrote about what a shrew she was. oh they sugar-coated it so if you are truly a nit-wit you would not see it (Rob claims his wife adored Carolyn,Billy claims she was ""magnificent"") but still you get th idea she ruined friendships, could not stop using drugs. Disgusting. Have they thought about the impact of her family? Never mind his they are used to it, but hers, like Carolyn, I do not think they wished to be in the spotlight. This book really captures Carolyn like Carol Raziwell's book did.Richard Blow does them justice and Rob Littel has the nerve to talk about Richard Blow's book. Why because Blow didn't trash them as he did. If you would like to read a book from someone who DID know them without Carolyn being bad-mouthed, this is the book."
2,a book more about the author than john john,"Richard Blow is a good writer (see Harvard Rules, Greatest Game). This is a very strange book in which the author waxes more about him and his place in JFK Jr's world, than the Man himself. Blow comes across as an educated posse; he thanks Bernard Bailyn in the acknowledgment section. But unfortunately, the author is no Kennedy. He is a Blow (now Bradley).(At one point, the author waxes poetically about how he wanted his own wedding to be as good as John's, a wedding which Blow was never invited to). In the end, Blow writes as if nothing would make him happier than being John John's full time jock strap sniffer.As for George Magazine, the advertisers fled in droves for a reason.This book will entertain you for the three hours it takes for you to read.If you buy this book for a $1 (plus $3.99 shipping), the book is worth your investment.On the other hand, I highly recommend Harvard Rules and the Greatest Game."
2,Just ok...,The book was an easy read. It was only ok. I got some insightof JFK BUT I had already read most of what he wrote. Not thebest book I have ever read.....
3,Not what I expected,"I wrote this book down in my to-read list when I saw it mentioned in the Washington Post. I was waiting for some insights into the life of Caroline and JFK. But after I began reading it, I almost felt a guilty pleasure for doing so. Blow kept mentioning that everyone wanted to get to know JFK and be around him while he was alive but to do that you needed to keep his life under wraps. So by JFK dying and Blow writing this book made me feel like I was dishonoring JFK and his legacy."
1,Let him rest in peace,"Author Richard Blow ..., gives readers far too much info about the Rich Blow experience in ""American Son."" At first blush, the book seemed to fit the ""Work for a famous person. When they die, tear up the confidentiality agreement and cash in"" formula. I wish I could report otherwise, but having read the book I have to report that it pretty much fit the formula. Rich Blow included little of substance about JFK Jr., told us far too much about himself, and adopted an obsequious and somewhat arrogant tone throughout."
1,How To Make Out on A Tragedy,"Most of the information in this book has been covered on TV or in magazines. What I found most disturbing though was the attempt to capitalize on a sad day in American history. John was famous and there are those that want to make money off of that fame. Very, very sad indeed and I am sorry I bought the book. I was looking for gossip and rumor and found it. I was looking for a good story and did not find it."
1,"This is a story about Richard Blow, not John F. Kennedy, Jr.","I am an avid biography and autobiography reader. I have read every book written on the Kennedy family. No wonder they are up in arms about the book. This book is about Blow and his experiences at George magazine. This is not a story about Mr. Kennedy. He simply used his name to sell a book because we are still so in awe of the only thing we as Americans know as ""royalty"". All of the mentions of Carolyn seem as if they were taken from the already well known published information in magazines. All of the examples of her except for one were instances that were well documented publically. Personally, I think someone in the Kennedy family should sue him."
2,Disappointing,"If you want to learn anything new about JFK jr. do NOT read this book. The book is basically one long whine-fest about why the magazine ""George"" failed (hint to Blow: because it was stupid!). Richard Blow apparently saw in the death of Kennedy his one shot at fame--nothing else had worked. Don't waste your money on this one."
4,A very personal report,"I bought the book when it first came out - 2002, but it lay around unread until 2010. Now retired I have time to read. This book captured what I hope was the real John F Kennedy, Jr. I too felt like I saw him grow up. On TV, I watched him crawl under the desk in the oval office and salute the casket of his father the day he did it. I remember hearing about the magazine GEORGE; I never read it. Even if I had not recognized the characters in this book, I would have enjoyed reading it. Not a page turner, AMERICAN SON is interesting with natural humor. It is a history book written while the memories were fresh."
2,Not a very revealing portrait,"For a man who had the chance to write an in-depth book about his very famous boss, Richard Blow has not succeeded. While first reading through ""American Son"" I thought the author treated his subject with a certain amount of distance and reverence. As I continued, that reverence simply became timidity.One learns surprisingly little about John F. Kennedy, Jr. in this book. Some may not know that JFK, Jr. had a temper or he liked to stroke his wife's hair when she visited him at the office. But I kept waiting for more and I think that Mr. Blow, while not hiding his love of JFK, Jr. has done a disservice....in an attempt to humanize him, the author has made Mr. Kennedy appear to be less of an interesting figure than he probably was.Richard Blow writes in an even, readable style. As with most things about JFK, Jr., however, the best part of ""American Son"" might just be the cover."
2,Sickening,"The book itself is the work of a man who desperately wants to be seen as part of the inner circle. Indeed he was not. As one reader posted, Blow really did not have the opportunity to spend that much time with John if you examine the contents of the book closely enough. As I was reading I got the feeling that Blow had to fill in a large amount of space that easily represents his lack of true knowledge about the subject. The book was long and held on mildly interesting anecdotes that have already been previously published about the Kennedys and in particular John. If Blow wanted to make waves, he should have revealed things that are not already known by the public. He could very easily have gotten his information from many other sources, thus rendering his own account less than unique. As someone who has read inordinate amounts of information on the Kennedys, I would not recommend this repetitious, boring work to anyone unless of course they can read it for free."
1,Who's this book about?,"Is this book about JFK, Jr. or is it about Richard Blow? After reading this book, it appeared to me that the author just wanted to make sure that in remembering JFK, Jr., that we all remembered that Blow worked with JFK, Jr. It's sad that someone like Blow, who is obviously talented in his own right, would decide to cash in so openly on his association with Kennedy."
3,Holden: an old character but a motivation to the new,"Me and my friend Carla just finished reading the book and just think it is great. Of an accessible language, mainly slang, it captures anyone looking for a guide to social training. What we enjoyed most was the range of language but we feel there should be a lot more professional and academic materials with which to learn as, in some countries like Portugal, it is part of the curriculum at certain colleges for those who are studying modern languages and translation."
2,Great Taste but poor packaging . Lots of broken suckers.,"I am very disappointed in my shipment. I bought a box of sweet and sour and a box of sweet pops. When I picked up the box off my porch I could hear the candy dust and pieces shift. Of the total of 96 suckers in both boxes, 39 were smashed or broken. The suckers that were still intact and wrapped taste like I remeber but not worth paying what I paid to have so many arrive broken."
1,"Bad Company, Bad Purchase!!",I will never purchase from this Company again! The candy was broken up and some of them looked old!! The box was in bad shape. I guess you get what you pay for!
1,Cracked up!!!!,They was all cracked up so I put them in the trash I did not want to send it back cause it was useless
4,Just like I remember,"When I received the package, all pops were intacked (no broken ones). They were just what I grew up with and remember as a kid. The box had an adequate amount of each flavor except for the blue rasberry, but those were always a rare find as a kid. There were only two of that kind. That is one thing I would like to see change. Another upside, I have plenty of candy for Halloween."
3,A bit disappointed.,"These are some of my favorite suckers! In my first order, I ordered 1 box. It contained a good mix of flavors and only a few of the suckers were broken. In this last order, I ordered 3 boxes. About 1/3 of the suckers in each box were broken and most of the suckers were the blue & white ones...not a good variety."
2,Horrible,I have ordered these suckers before i guess it must have been through a different seller and it is worth paying the shipping because when i paid for the shipping half the box wasnt broke! I just got these today and the suckers were all sticky due to most of them being broke what a great package to recieve!
3,broke suckers,there were a lot of them broke suckers but i still love themmaybe next time inwill have not so many broke ones
5,Perfect!,"My husband received this for his birthday and loves it! It was exactly as stated, looks great had a great price and arrived as promised. I am already looking for something from this seller for my son's 16th birthday! Thanks"
2,Love my watches..,"I love quality watches.Fot the money spent on this one, it's a disappointment. It does not have a screw in crown, the crystal is flat (so glare makes it difficult to read), and the movable timer ring (bazel) is difficult to rotate and very in accuate in it's movement. The band is made of poorly stamped Titanium...Bummer as I really wanted to like this watch... On the up side it is light."
3,It's OK,"I have had this watch for a couple of years now, still works great, but I am very disappointed with the way the titanium band metal areas have worn and scratched it does not look very good. I would buy another Wenger, but not this model*** Previous Review after purchase ***I read reviews and looked and many Wenger models before selecting this watch. My pervious watch was a Wenger which I served me well over the years. I have been very satisfied with this watch so far. It is very light, rugged and good looking. As some of the reviews I read indicated I could not get the pins out to adjust the band length and had to take it a shop to remove some links. It is still new so I can not speak for durability yet other than my pervious experience with Wenger, which is a good one."
5,Great!!,"Watch came in wonderful packaging (I was not prepared for that) and it was more than what I expected. It's a light weight watch, due to the titanium. My boyfriend tears through watches like there is no tomorrow because he's in construction...this one I bought him 8 months ago and one of the pins fell out. Not his fault though.Oh ya - FYI - you'll need to find a small mom/pop fix it place for any issues with the wrist band on these...no where else carries the special pin."
4,It a really cute book,"Anna Anderson has a good job, great friends and most of all no kids. But that that going to chance when her best friend Laura annouces that she is going to have a baby and she meets a tax inspector Michael who happens to have a baby girl Lily. But is Anna really to commit to guy with a child?""Two's Company"" was the first book by Sue Haasler and it was pretty good. The book is not deep or long but it is worth the read."
5,Great book!,"We think it was a very good story about a girl called Cam. Her real name is Jennifer, but most people call her Cam because she has photographic memory. We recommend that you read this book.Mr. FieldsELL CenterHorace Mann Middle SchoolSheboygan, Wisconsin"
5,Another One Of Davis A. Aldler's Great Mysteries,"I have read some of his books but I actually stumbled on one of his best books! I really was a serios fan of his books until now. now this is what the books about:Cam's box camera vanishs from the science fair,and valuble gold coins are disapeared from a coin shop.Cam's sure that the vanishing acts are simliar to it. Please read this great book or one of his other best work:)"
5,Oi !! I Want Another Pint!,"One of the greatest rock album covers of all time (it hangs upon my wall), this re-released pub rock classic crackles the speakers from the opening riffs to the last power chord. Island Records originally messed with this Rods effort upon its release in the states back in '77, dropping certain studio tracks in favor of tacking on some live EP material to capitilize on the American's penchant for live performances. This has all been corrected as the LP is back in its original form, with the addition of numerous bonus tracks - the aforementioned live tracks, some rarities and a handful of A and B sides. Crank this sucker up and just imagine the pint glasses crashing off the walls way back in the 70's....5 stars"
4,At Last!,"Well at last - at least one of the early Rods albums have finally made it to CD. I think perhaps you had to have been there to fully enjoy this album. It isn't going to win any new converts to the Hot Rods. But then again, don't let my view color your perceptions too much.Basically the Rods were a pub band who made it ""big."" This album was their first - though not necessarily their best. The title track actually charted. Other than that - well there isn't anything bad about this one - just nothing outstanding. If it were rleased as a new Cd today it would no-doubt bomb badly. But it's a little bit of England - a drop of late 60's R & B living through the 70's. There's a very good reason that a number by the Who is on this one.Personally, I can't imagine NOT owning this one."
3,"(Second time), let's see if AMZN lets this one stay","High energy punky rock with good pop sensibilities. The best material is the selctions from ""TEENAGE DEPRESSION"", and the singles off of LIFE ON THE LINE & THRILLER (released prior to Michael Jackson's album of the same name).Unfortunately, this is basically ""kid rock"", and while it may have sounded great in an age of disco, like a lot of 1970's material, it has not aged too well.The few standout cuts are extremely good: Get Out Of Denver (the old Bob Seger tune), and Do Anything You Wanna Do, and a few others make this a must for the punk collector, but as a costly import it will probably be one CD a less avid archivist will pass on."
1,This is not what it seems,"Buyer Beware. This is not a story about Peter Duel. If you want to see this book, find someone who has it and look first. Do not spend money unless you want a comic book that has little to do with Mr. Duel, and a lot to do with the author. If I could give it negative star rating, I would."
1,This is not a paperback.,I hate this grafic novel it has virtually nothing to do with Pete Duel. I should have spent more money and bought his biography. I wanted to give it 0 stars but they wouldn't let me. Don't waste your money.
1,comic,"The title is very misleading. This is not a book, its just pages and pages of comic drawings that may not appeal to very many. It certainly does not appeal to Pete Duel's fans."
1,disapointed,i am a pete duel fan and i did not like this book at all! this book really has nothing to do with pete. its a comic book and is not about pete. the only reason i kept the book was for the news paper cliping of petes death on the front page. that is the only thing there is about pete in this book!
5,This comic book is awesome.,"This is a well-made comic book. The story is interesting and you can relate to it. There's comedy, pity, and a whole variety of emotions expressed in the book artistically and cleverly. The drawings are distinct. I definetely recommend it."
3,Only 4 lbs,The information presented on amazon stated it was an 8lb scale; it's only 4lbs. Other than that it looks great in my wife's shop.
4,Confessions,"It needs 5 stars, but your accompanying comment to 5 stars is not appropriate. Wonderful it is nevertheless. A good book."
2,Keep your money,"I used to buy these shoes at some dollar store across the street from my house and reading these reviews, it is obvious that the quality on these ones are no better than the ones that I used to see. I would never pay more than $10 for these things unless there is a better quality version out there."
2,Cute but Impractical,"I got these shoes a week ago and now I'm sending them back. they were adorable, but they smelled funny, were too stiff, and the little buckle was really chinzy. I let them sit out on my floor for a couple of days thinking that maybe my opinion would change, but nope; off they go again tomorrow!"
4,I like them,"I ordered a pair of these several months ago, and they've become my favorite pair of summer shoes. They're really, really comfortable.They did have a strong smell when they arrived, but I just let them air our for a few months and the smell faded. I intended to wear them only for SCA/Ren Fair use, but they're so comfortable that I'm wearing them to work 2 or 3 days a week.I will probably order another pair when these wear out."
2,Turpentine smell,"I ordered a pair of black cotton mary janes and I had the same problem with the turpentine smell. I was prepared for it because of reading other reviews and was willing to take my chances for the price. I wonder if any of the other colors or fabrics had the same problem. I washed them in vinegar water immediately after buying them and it helped some but they still stink. I'm going to wrap them in a clear plastic bag to transport them on the plane and hope they don't make my other clothes smell, and I'm still going to wear them and hope nobody else can smell them."
4,They were cute!!,When i saw the other reviews i was afraid of what they'd smell like but when i got them today i was happy because the smell wont stay forever. I love these shoes.
2,Not so great,"I purchased this item judging by its comfort factor. All's well except the buckles do not have pins to hold the straps in place. The straps slip off occassionally, causing the shoes to come loose."
1,Very Low Quality,"These shoes appear to be thin fabric glued over cardboard. They smell bad, have no pin in the buckle to keep the strap from slipping, have permanant wrinkles in the toe area from poor construction, and the sole is made of a light, slick material that I don't care for. I would return these shoes if not for the money lost on shipping both ways. Save your money!"
2,"Stinky, but comfortable","I bought these shoes about a year ago, and ended up not keeping them because of the stench. I couldn't get it out, and was too self-conscious about it when wearing them because other people commented on the smell! Eww! They were comfortable, true, but made of rather cheap materials. Because of the smell and the rather cheap, crinkly material on the body of the shoe, I wouldn't recommend it."
3,"Cute, but a bit flimsy.","These were great as an addition to my Powerpuff Girls Buttercup cosplay. They were pretty comfortable, except that the buckle kept getting a little loose. They don't seem to be made of the best material, but you can't beat the price."
3,not overly impressed,"I like the shoes and they're very comfortable, but it took some time for the strange smell to go away. And after about a month, one of the buckles broke and I had to put velcro on the strap and shoe to keep them fastened.Not bad for the price, but quality is lacking."
1,the very thin/poorly made buckle for the shoe strap broke right away,"there was no smell at all like the other reviews mentioned...they are a little stiff (the bottom and the material, but comfortable; just not as thin and flexible as better quality chinese shoes...cute and trendy though...i tried them on right when i got them and the side buckle for the shoe strap broke right away when i was putting the strap thrpough it;wtf???the buckle(which has no pin by the way)is very thin and bends when you put the strap in,so it makes perfect sense that it would break very easily sooner or later;with me it broke of in half right away though;i probably got the ""lemon"" pair lol so i don't know; i will try to take it to a shoe repair place and see if they can fix it for me,which will be more money;but i wouldn't by these again;very poorly made :("
1,Not like the ones I used to buy,"I used to buy this type of shoe from Pier 1. They were light and comfortable. These have a harder sole that does not bend, and are poorly made. A waste of money."
2,Many Mistakes,"This book is full of mistakes. It would be very difficult for someone without CAD experience to complete the exercises because of the mistakes. If you can't complete the exercises, you can't learn the features of AutoCAD 2000. Don't expect an answer if you email them about this, either. I've been waiting 2 weeks so far."
2,poor reference manual,"if someone gave this book five stars, then we must be in a pretty sad state of affairs as far as cad ref manuals go. the index is loaded with entries, but they never seem to point in the right direction. when i do find the correct subtopic i'm looking for, i have to muddle through two paragraphs about why the tool or command exists and how it differs from acad14 before i get to the meat of what it is or how to use it.i'll admit i never used the tutorials, but who really learns these programs by going through tedious, time-consuming and easily forgotten exercises? i would assume most professionals would rather have a reference guide that gives clear, concise answers to questions as they come up."
4,"Book offers mix of ideas, information","The title of this book caught my attention immediately. I've always been interested in dream theories (such as those provided my Freud and Jung) so this seemed to fit right along with what I'd been reading. However, ""The Dream Story"" proved to be an even better and more practical book than those by Frued and Jung. I found a lot of the information useful, and the philosophies (though some were esoteric) were interesting to toy around with. There's some information about children's dreams, which was quite fascinating. I wish he would have included more of that. All in all, I'd say this is an entertaining book, not overly techinical, but still chocked full of information and ideas."
5,Can't Beat It!,"As I was buying this as a gift I had MOM check it out. Both she and my grandmother were seamstresses. She gave it two thumbs up and suggested this as the machine to buy. So even though my word doesn't mean diddly when it comes to sewing, take it from Mom! It is a steal."
5,Spectacular piece of educational literature from one of the greatest young minds of all time aka: Jimmy Search,"The voice of young Jimmy Search is wonderfully rendered by the pen of Judy Wolfman in this must read. Life on a Goat Farm is about three young men with very bright futures on the farm, and the book chronicles their adventures and responsibilities. I can honestly say that this is one of the most captivating pieces of non-fiction that I have ever read. I bought this for my seven and nine year old children who were obsessed with farms, and they could not get enough of this awe inspiring story. This is a must read for children, adults, theists, anarchists, and farm enthusiasts alike."
4,great tacker,great product but don't use it for carpet padding. you will need the HT-770 since you could use longer leg staple in that tacker. but after 4 years it has been very reliable.
3,Stapler,Parts were missing. I had to buy parts separately.It took time and about $15.00 to make it operational. Somewhat disappointed.
5,Great book for history buffs.,"John Dillinger Slept Here is a great book, full of detailed history of St. Paul gangster activity from the 1920's and 30's. A long time history buff, I started to get curious about St. Paul's role in the gangster era after reading Steven Thayer, and even more interested after taking the local gangster tour--only to find out that the gangster tour appears to have been taken from the pages of Maccabee's book. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
3,The Town Ironically Named After St. Paul,"This book certainly delivers in that it's a factual depiction of the vice and corruption which existed in the gangland haven of St. Paul, Minnesota, during the Twenties and Thirties. If you think you'd be at all interested in the subject matter, then by all means ""John Dillinger Slept Here"" is for you. However, I bought this book more or less based on the glowing descriptions put forth in prior online reviews and, from a strictly personal standpoint, I expected more and was somewhat disappointed. There is, however, an interesting profile of sheriff-turned-criminal Verne Miller, who engineered what went down in the annals of crime as the bloody ""Kansas City Massacre,"" and the author does fill in the gaps regarding the fatal shooting by St. Paul police of Dillinger gang remnant Homer Van Meter in August, 1934. For these alone it's probably worthwhile reading."
4,Great collection!,"Much praise for this collection - the label was smart enough to take the original VHS release and make it better on DVD by adding all the videos missing from the VHS. This has every single video by Simply Red (that I know of!) I wish it was in DTS, but I'm more interested in having all of a performer's videos on one disc. They left nothing off!"
2,Dissappointed,"Unless you are a ""real"" fan of Simply Red and follow them closely, do not expect to know many of the songs on this DVD. I only knew 2 of them and the one song I wanted, ""You Make Me Feel Brand New"" is not even on it."
4,A fabulous sourcebook for those in the know,"Short on how-to or fully realized anything, but long on inspiration--and not just for knitters! I wouldn't recommend it to a beginner, but for an experienced crocheter like me it is a priceless source of ideas to expand, alter, and manipulate. (I have never once used a motif exactly as graphed in the book.)I love how the motifs is organized by geographic origin, so I can use patterns that are culturally relevant to the person for whom I'm making an item. This book also inspired me to start graphing my own designs.(And I've never had any problems with the binding... I like the binder/interior coil style, as it lays flatter than a traditional paperback binding.)"
2,1000 graphs and 5 Photos,"This is a nice size book but disappointingly, comprised almost entirely of graphs. There ought to have been more (than the five photos) included along side some of the graphs to let you know how the motifs may come out. There is some explanations and ideas provided but that is on the light side too. If you still think you might like to get this book, I'd recommend taking a look at it first."
4,The best book for design ideas!,"I am relatively new to knitting, and I have been searching for a couple years for a book that would just have patterns in it ..... and I've finally found it!This is the best knitting ""idea"" book I have come across!! The book is divided into designs based on region, and there are so very many wonderful ideas!! I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for some fresh new patterns.The fact that the book is spiral-bound is super, too. It will lay open so you can follow it while knitting. The only bad thing about the whole book is that the spiral rings actually come out of the binding when you try to close it, so you have to insert the rings back into the holes before you close it. At least that's what happens with mine!! But it's definitely worth the effort!Overall, hands down, the BEST knitting companion I've ever found!!"
5,Pure excellence,"I was enthralled by this book, and have infact read it 6 times in the past 10 years. The style of writting is impecable, and the characterisation is very believeble. Usually, after reading a sci-fi novel, I, as a writer, think ""that was good, but I would have done it differently"" - with this book, I was stunned to find myself thinking ""I could never write something that good"". Well done, James Hogan."
4,Great idea...good characters,"Great idea of a man found on the moon is 50,000 years old.When Hogan uses just the stoy and dialogue to move things along/to exchange ideas/involving the reader with what is happening--he is excellent. But when he uses the author as voice over--let me fill you in on what's happening now through straight prose--the story weakens. This also shows up in another Hogan novel I'm reading. James--you are excellent in story-narrative-dialogue--no more Telling us what's happening, a good editor would of said, James--SHOW us don't TELL us. Still worth 4 stars."
1,"Pirate, Bootleg,You Name It","I read the reviews listed and decided I couldn't wait and now I wish I had. The Disc Itself Has a Sticker Over the CD with some guy jogging on it and the tracks are all so jumbled (if you compare them to what is on the back flap) it makes this sadly the worst buy I have or could ever make. Trust me, DON't wastes $80 - it's not worth 2 cents"
1,Not the real CD,"The picture you see up top is not the actual CD. There was an official CD release of this, but it has ""Cancelled Passport Edition"" in the upper left hand corner. Anyone selling a copy that looks like this is selling a fake."
1,PRICE???,What`s up with the price. Even if it was not boot-leg you`d be crazy to spend that kind of money on a cd. Good grief buy the movie for $10 to $20 bucks and tape the music yourself. I mean in this day in age!!Mike
4,Worth walking on,"Dharma Paths is an accessible book on Tibetan Buddhism for the layperson yet elaborate enough to use in a class or a program of self-study. It employs an extensive use of Buddhist taxonomy (the 5 paths, the 6 perfections, etc.)Some of the explanations are a bit too densely ethereal, so to speak, sort of a dharma angel food cake.There are also a few puzzling contradictions - for example, the Path of Meditation has 10 stages on p.225 but only 8 on p.242. I'm not sure what to make of Khempo Karthan Rinpoche's explanation of the Mahayana and Hinayana paths, as it's unlike any other description I've ever read. But overall this book is a verysatisfying read on the dharma."
3,Good but didn't last,"My watch was fine for a little over a year. Then the indiglow light wouldn't work any more. I thought it might be the battery, so I had it replaced. This didn't help. I subsequently noticed condensation inside the face of the watch. Less than a month later the face fell off. (These later problems may have been the result of changing the battery, as the sales people at Target who did it took almost an hour and didn't seem to be very knowledgeable about what they were doing!) I glued the face back on, but there was still condensation inside and now some of the LED segments are not working."
4,Beep!,"Pros:> Alarm beeps a couple of ways for about a minute, then stops. Very handy!> Easy to set an hourly beep to let you know as each hour passes.> Indiglo - check the time in the middle of the night.> Unlike calendars on analog watches, you don't have to advance a day on 30-day months.> Very affordable price for a good-looking and practical watch.Cons:> Expansion band is a little tight> Calendar does not have a year, so some changes are required in February.> Probably have to mess with ""spring forward, fall back"" as well"
1,Personal Best needs Qualification,"I purchased the set hoping to get the some of the best bits / most well known sketches of Monty Python and I have been sorely disappointed. The interludes in Cleese's disc are ludicrous / unfunny, as are a number of them on other discs. My suggestion would be for the owners of the material to have a fan vote for what is the best and make a set out of that so maybe we could get the Ministry of Silly Walks and other well known pieces rather than second rate renditions filmed at the Hollywood Bowl."
5,Impressed!,This is my 3rd or 4th beard trimmer. I bought this one because I wanted one that also worked when it was plugged in (I don't have where to leave it plugged in). That works well but I am really impressed with the vacuum feature. It really works as advertised. Very little cleanup required afterwards - makes for a happy spouse.
4,the best one,"Well in today corporate world I'm really surprised when the product actually is what the advertisement say. The most surprising part is that the vacuum pump really does the job. It's not perfect but I'd say 95% at turbo mode. I didn't gave it 5 stars because the order of stupid buttons is confusing, the turbo is like extra and actually should be the normal mode (it's a still a product of corporate mentality) and the pies for adjusting the height of the trim is black and you can't see were the blade exactly cuts. Should be transparent. Also doesn't have base and can't be put upright. (did I mention corporate thinking). Other than that is a good product. Definitely much better than Wahl at double price. Hope it will last at least a year. I have it in use for about a month."
4,"Does the job, designed well , and neat features...","Not a bad trimmer. Had a Wahl trimmer before and it broke within a year. This unit is unique in that it has a built in vacuum. It catches short hairs, but long hair tends to clog the inlet. As a result it reduces the trimming quality unless the inlet is cleaned and dispenser emptied. I am glad for the shorter blade that helps define the trim edges and areas around the moustache.Overall I am pleased with the product. However, not worth the $40. Less than $25 fits in the price range ."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,This is defiantly a great buy! Even though it may be fairly loud it's nothing compared to how well this product works. I'm very satisfied.
4,A good replacement,"This is my second trimmer. My first, a Remington was at least 15 years old and worked like a champ. It had it's problems like many of these in holding the desired length. But you learn to hold it tight so it won't change while trimming. I babied the batteries for years and quite honestly if you don't, with Ni-Cads you'll be replacing them or the trimmer a lot sooner.I like this one and was concerned by some of the negative reviews. I don't use a lot of pressure when trimming so I haven't seen it change (shorten) while trimming. The vacuum feature is nice and works well. Others complained about getting up under the nose. This is no different from any others I've tried that use a blade guard.I'd give it 5 stars if I had it longer. So far so good and has lived up to or beyond my expectations. I'm still on the first charge so time will tell. If it lasts half as long as my Remington I'll be happy."
4,A trimmer with TURRRRRBO,"A turbo button on a beard trimmer? Those people at Norelco are insane! For me, this unit replaced an older model Norelco from a few years back. What a major upgrade it was! The blade adjustment is precise. The blades are sharp and cut quickly without hassle or pulling on the beard. The vacuum works great and grabs cut hair. Haven't used the turbo feature yet but it sounds powerful.The T980 comes with a mustache trimmer, AC adapter, carrying case, and a brush to clean the blades.It works great, makes beard upkeep a non-issue, and fits into a hand naturally. Well done, Norelco."
1,Terrible Product; Does Not Hold a Charge,"The title pretty much says it all. If this works, great. However, getting this thing to work is the issue."
2,"Great, except for one thing","The trimmer works perfectly in every sense. The only thing that kills it is the fact that they decided to include an AC adapter that only works with 120 volts. In other words, if you travel, you can't charge this trimmer in most other countries. I don't think it's that much more expensive to include an adapter that accepts 110-230 volts. My last Norelco trimmer that lasted 7 years could accept 110-230 volts and was always with me in my travels.Items such as trimmers, shavers, cell phones, laptops, etc. all should accept 110-230 volts, since they are mostly travel items."
2,loud and unprecise,biggest complaints goes on the noise of the trimmer thanks to the vacuum and very unprecise cut of the beard
5,Excellent Trimmer,"Before buying this trimmer, I would always buy the $20.00 trimmers at the local superstore. After buying this amazing trimmer, I will never go back.The trimmer is precise, and you do not need to repeat. And the vacuum, when using the turbo, gets all the hair; it leaves no mess at all.I am really pleased."
1,settings slip,"This product is terrible. The settings slip, especially between 3 and 2. The vacuum feature ensures that you can not use this for anything other than basic beard and moustache trim. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Need a Closer Shave!,"The Philips literature says the lowest (#1) setting trims your beard down to stubble but this is just not so. Mine isn't close to that. Overall, the trimmer has a lot of positive points (quiet, efficient, vacuum works well, etc) but this is a big drawback for me."
3,"Good machine, but not vacuum","This is a great machine, but the vacuum is far from perfect. It is still a messy procedure, don't think that the vacuum will keep your bathroom clean. It might still be worth buying this model over the one $10 cheaper, because in addition to the vacuum, this model works plugged in when the battery is drained."
2,Not fully supported,"I've used this trimmer for about the last two years. It does the job pretty well. However, recently the removable hair catching unit got stuck and, when I pulled too hard, the plastic broke. I checked Norelco's website but the catcher didn't show up in the replacement parts list. I then called Norelco and was told that the hair catching unit is not an available replacement part. It seems absurd that the only removable part on the unit, a part that is removed regularly as a part of its function, a part that is made of fragile plastic, would not be available for replacement. This means that because I broke two cents worth of plastic, I now have to toss out a $40 beard trimmer. I'm now looking for a trimmer with no removable parts and, preferably, without the Norelco name on it."
2,Not what they claim it to be!,"the only reason i got this trimmer was because of its vacuum function and its disappointing.the trimmer does a good job of trimming like so many other trimmers but its vacuum function only sucks in 50% of the hair on turbo! which really doesnt make a difference since u still have to waste the same amount of time cleaning up that you would with other non-vacuum trimmers.so if your looking to buy a trimmer that spares you the mess and saves time, this ain't the one."
2,Not As Good,"I've had the Older model of Norelco very plain, simple and still working. This one has too much bell and whistle but not as good as the older model. I would've returned it back to Amazon if shipping wasn't an issue."
5,top notch product for a great price,"this product is the best trimmer i ever had with a vacuum. no external mess,the variable speeds,and depths make it a product to meet anyone's needs."
2,A disappointment,"I had a Norelco trimmer for years, and it worked quite well. When it finally died, I bought this as a replacement. What a disappointment! The cover over the blade is either too thick, or poorly placed. Either way, the result is that no matter how close a trim I want -- that is, no matter what the number on trim closeness I use -- I get a mediocre result. It doesn't go close enough -- not nearly close enough. I wind up having to take off that cover, which makes it really hard to get an even trim. Very disappointing, especially after years of satisfaction with a trimmer from the same company."
4,Good trimmer,"The first time I used it, I was not very impressed. But each time I use it now, I am more pleased. Once you learn to use it, you will like it. It is very powerful, even without the boost. The vacuum is not perfect, but a lot better than not having one. I have a full beard and it does not pull my facial hair when I use it. I would highly reccomend it."
2,Not impressed - Now its broken,"I purchased this in March of 2010, about 21 months ago. I was never particularly impressed by the vacuum function. I'm sure it sucked in some of the hair, but whats the point if you still have to clean your sink?Recently it broke. Since I only used it every 3-4 weeks, that means it probably broke after about 30 uses. The springs that flexed the comb popped out. I would not recommend anyone purchase this item."
2,Not very good,"The blades on this are not very sharp, and the length adjustment collapses when in use. I would not recommend this trimmer."
3,Plastic pieces fall off,"The power and trimming of this razor is fine. My issue is with the plastic cover that holds in your beard trimmings. Mine falls off easy, spilling the trimmings over the floor. Also the trimmings jam in the narrow vacuum slot. If you do something like take off the cover and bang out the razor over a trashcan, you will lose the filter in the trash can. I have adapted by trimming with my finger holding the cover on, and banging it out while holding onto the filter."
4,"Works well, but vacuum not up to the challenge...",My husband has an incredibly thick and coarse beard... the trimmers work well but the vacuum simply cannot handle the sheer volume and coarseness of his facial hair.Still - there's definitely LESS left over for me to clean up after he trims his beard!
5,works very well,"trim length goes from stubble (1) to long (9), works really well. vacuum sucks hairs well."
5,The Best,"I love these - easy to use, quality cut, holds a charge for months, less mess that most. I owuld recommend them to everyone."
4,good trimmer,"I have bought a lot of different trimmers before and I have always had a problem with clean up of the sink afterwards. the fact that this trimmer had a built in vacuum was a deffinate bonus.The trimmer itself works great, and the adjustable hights are easy to use. It would be nice if the vacuum was more powerful and it was a bit quieter."
4,Usable trimmer,"1. Noisy2. Vacuum filter is not perfect, some small hair pieces go to the air around. I don't use it indoors.3. Trimming level can be accidentally changed in process, which is unacceptable. You should check it all the time.4. Strong battery, at least new. Holds charge for 3-4 sessions.Overall quality is good."
5,Kensington Digital FM Transmitter/Car Charger for iPod,Excellent product. Works well and easily and vacuum element keeps beard trimmings from dirtying shirt.
2,not as good as the trimmer on my Norelco shaver,"I've had a Norelco 8000 series shaver with a trimmer for awhile. When I grew a beard, I bought this unit based on the reviews I read here at Amazon. It's true that because of the vacuum, there is less hair in the sink. But the quality of its trimming is far below that on my Norelco shaver. If I'd known then what I know now, I would have passed on this item. It may be good for those who don't have a Norelco shaver with the trimming feature, (and don't want to pay a hundred dollars or more for such a shaver). But for those who have such a shaver, this product is, at best, superfluous.January 29, 2008It's not even a year later, and it has broken already. I'm not a happy camper."
1,Not for precision.,"How in the world does this thing get 5 stars? The adjustable trimmer doesn't 'snap' when adjusting to number 2 trim. It also silently switches from trim number 3 - 2 if you press down hard enough. Also the blade has a 'shield' that aids in sucking the cut hair down into the collection chamber. The problem is the 'shield' blocks the head of the blade. Very dangerous if your cutting a line for your moustache-- your literally cutting blind. It does come with a cheap attachment for linings, but I prefer cutting from the blade, like in the older models.Too much of my life depends on how good of a shave I give myself. This time Norelco doesn't cut it. The one star is for the vacuum."
4,Looking good,"This product has done all that a beard trimmer should do. Good battery, sharp cutter. I would recommend to a friend"
1,Major Disappointment,"I've gone through several other beard trimmers, and was very excited about the features this one provides: adjustability, turbo vacuum, EASY-adjust, ability to use corded OR cordless.However, in practice, I've been very frustrated by this one. Adjustability was fine. The easy-adjust ring was nice. It functioned great plugged in or not. The problems I encountered were:1 The swing-out door to empty the clippings broke. It's cheap, and has barely any material supporting it. It's not like you can just tape it closed, because you need to be able to open it.2)The spring-loaded trimmings hatch stuck open, and lost its spring. So, even holding the clippings-door closed, trying to ""make-do"" and not have to discard this so soon, is very frustrating because the trimmings don't get captured - they stay at the top and spillover the trimmer.3)The turbo has no extra sucking effect. It's useless.4)The turbo is too easily turned on by accident.5)The turbo is LOUD."
2,Clean cut but few problems,"I bought this trimmer in 2009 and have been using it every week since. It is easy to handle and provide a comfortable clean cut. However it is very hard to clean. The trap's hinges broke twice already. This is rechargeable trimmer with a long lasting battery (~8 beard trims) but it is not really a travel trimmer. It charges only on 110v and the on/off switch place atop tends to turn the trimmer on in its traveling bag. I ended up growing a thick holiday beard on few occasion! As for the turbo, I never figured it's use.Bottom line, it is a good value home trimmer to handle delicately."
3,It worked but could have been better,"Not bad but it could have had better vacuum, or at least it could have sucked in hair better. Over all it was decent."
4,Electric Beard Razor,"The electric beard razor works as promised. It's fast and easy. It is easy to adjust, relatively quite, vacumms up the cuttings quite well. The only thing that could be improved would to have a built in edge trimmer. Changing the blade to trim is easy but when you are used to a flip out edge trimmer on your regular razor you don't see why this could have the same feature. Next time."
4,Almost as good as they said.,"Not much to complain about, really. Reviews were mostly positive and I agree. The one thing I will say is the vacuum is not quite as good as reviews said.I was led to believe 90% of the hair would be collected and not end up all over the place, but it is more like 60% of the hair is captured, and quite a bit still ends up all over the sink. Other than that, fantastic."
4,Trimmer,"I took a chance getting this. The trimmer I had been using was Philips but it was dropped and it broke. I bought another make to replace the broken one and didn't like it at all, it wouldn't get close enough to trim my beard to the length I want. This trimmer is pretty good, it vacuums up most of the loose hair when I trim my beard and leaves little mess. I used to go out back to trim my beard (real drag when it rains) and let it fall in to the lawn but no need for that now. It cuts evenly and doesn't miss any hair. It also has a reasonable price. I give it two thumbs up."
3,"Adequate Trimmer, Vacuum","This is an adequate trimmer. I bought it to replace a previous Norelco trimmer that I had for years. The vacuum is not strong enough to prevent lots of hairs everywhere, but post-trim cleanup is much faster now. Not any louder than my previous trimmer, even on ""turbo"", which I always have on. On the non-Turbo setting, the trim quality is noticeably degraded. On Turbo the trim is pretty good. The comb does not allow good mustache trimming. Overall this trimmer is pretty good, but is not the all-in-one trimmer that I was looking for. I would try a different product if I had it to do all over again."
3,It's Ok,"I suppose I would still recommend this, but it's not all that it's cracked up to be. It cuts well, but it doesn't catch as much as it billed to. In addition, I cannot ever use it in the non-turbo mode, otherwise, it won't catch anything.Still recommended though, it keeps it a lot cleaner than without, just a little disappointing..."
5,Excellent trimmer for the money,I have been using this trimmer for about 18 months now and it still works great. I haen't had any issues and would recommend to anyone.
4,no surprises,"This is my second beard trimmer. Previously had a [...] that was powered by 3 AAA batteries. Was very underpowered and I stopped using it. The Norelco trimmer works much better. It is more powerful and somewhat bigger. I like that I can plug it in also. So far after 3 trim jobs, the batteries are going strong without a recharge.The turbo vac works fairly well. Some hairs endup in the sink, but I expected this. Quality is good, the adjustment for cutting length worked OK. My only beef is the filter cup that hold the cut hair is a little clumsy to work with. It is plastic, so you need to be careful when sliding it back on not to get it jammed or stuck."
4,T980 Vacuum Trimmer Review,Excellent product. The Plus and Minus factors are:- The Vacuum works. This is big plus. I can trim my beard without mess.Before I had to take a shower to get off the beard trimmings or I woulditch all day. Also my sink is clean another plus- Off On button needs to be moved. Its easy to shut off by grabbing thehandle. Small minus.- Vacuum clip catcher. Plastic piece needs to handled with care. Smallminus.- Trimmer. Nice even trim. I tried small bladed products. They leave yourbeard loking chopped up. Big Plus.- Overall. This is a great product for men like me who have had beardsall their lives. I have been trimming 30 years. This one is nice sofar.
2,Mediocre Trimmer,"I bought this trimmer to reduce the hair particulate that was building up in my bathroom from daily trimming. It did do that well; unfortunately, that's all it did well. The air intake plastic lip made a close shave VERY DIFFICULT to achieve. Also, the blades did not move quickly enough to avoid occasional pulling of hairs. Also, I noticed far more skin irritation using this product than any past trimmers. I bought an Oster trimmer for nearly the same price on amazon and been supremely happy with it. I'd prefer to live with a few hair clippings than put up with a mediocre, albeit flashier, trimmer."
2,Dissapointing,"I chose this trimmer mostly because of the vacuum feature. Unfortunately the vacuum only captures maybe half the trimmings. I am not sure yet, but it seems to catch only the shortest cuttings.Also:The directions say that charging more than necessary will reduce battery life. Modern decent-quality rechargeable devices automatically prevent overcharging so you can plug it in and forget it. For the price this product should have that feature."
4,Excellent Trimmer,I gave it as a gift and he seems to be delighted. He has said that it is much better than his old trimmer in that it floats closer to all areas of his face and the turbo vacuum is terrific.
4,Good trimer. Short battery charge.,Works well. Good ergonomics. Convenient length adjustment. Hair collector works but has limited benefit in my opinion. Charge doesn't last long but it is rechargeable so not really an issue.
2,Degrades over time.,"At first, I liked the Norelco Vacuum trimmer quite a bit--it was nice to have all the hair vacuumed up as I trimmed my beard. However, it's degraded over time. I'm not sure whether the blades dulled out very quickly, but after six months of use, it requires many, many passes to trim to the desired length. I did not have this experience with my previous trimmer and I will be looking for a new trimmer soon--retiring this one after less than a year of service."
5,Norelco beard trimmer,"I am pleased with the product and its ease of use. The trim time takes less than one minute, and only seconds to clean the razor."
2,clogs constantly,"I have owned various panasonic beard trimmers for past 20 years, untli the non-replaceable batteries go bad. This is the first one I have had which sucks the trimmings into a built-in container, which is a great idea. The problem is it clogs every 2-3 strokes, which makes it unusable. Now, if you use this on a daily or every 2-3 day basis, and are cutting hairs taht are 1/8"" long, for instance, I bet it would work well. But when you do trimming every 1-2 weeks, and the hair is 1/4"" or longer for head hair, it will clog, and this product is not for you. So I would give it 0 stars if you are like me, or 4 stars if you plan on using it constantly, for an overall score of 2 stars."
2,Nothing special...,I purchased this electric razor when my old Phillips Norelco razor died on me. I had it for about 6 years so I figured I would stay with the company. This razor is way to bulky and does not get close enough for a good trim for your mustache or goatee. After one day of use the blue piece that gathers the hair into the vacuum broke right off. I returned this razor the next day for a refund. I would definitely not recommend this razor for facial use.
4,Design problems but a good product,"I own an earlier model of this trimmer and over all am happy with it. The only issue I had with my old one and this model which I just purchased is the ""door"" in the front just under the cutting blades.On my first one, the spring hold the door up broke allowing it to drop and lose much of the vacuum. I was not really excited about purchasing another model with this same design but because the overall trimmer function has worked well for over four years decided to purchase a new one.The only reason I purchased a new one is the charger broke and I had no way to recharge the battery and because it was over 4 years old figured the battery did not have much life in it."
1,shifts levels,First shave and my husband lost his short beard. It shifted levels without him knowing it and left a racing strip. Needless to say he had to shave completely. Luckily he didn't trim his mustache. The vacuum works great but that's about it.
1,Cheap Product,"If you set it on level 5 and you push too hard, you may not have a beard. The locking system is a joke. The Norelco trimmer I bought 7 years ago has a better locking system."
2,Can't hold it's setting,"I got mine around three weeks ago. The good news is that it cuts my beard well, and the vacuum is not noisy. The bad news is 1) the controls are positioned such that I find myself accidently hitting the on/off switch as I am shaving, no huge deal but annoying, 2) the vacuum action catches 95% of the hairs but 95% means you still have to clean up afterwards so it is of dubious value, and most importantly 3) it does not hold its distance setting. I find that, as I shave, the shave length setting can very easily be pushed down so that I end up with a much shorter beard than I intended. I can't imagine why after all these years Norelco has not come up with a better system for locking down the shave length so that it does not get changed by the mere act of shaving. In my opinion this last issue makes it a dud product that fails at its intended function, and I would recommend against buying it."
5,BLADES OF FURY,"This trimmer is sharper than the devil himself. My cat, Loid, was once 10lbs of fur and bones. Now, he's just bones. A lot of people say that the blade level switches on them during use. So let me get this straight. Our boys are in Iraq fighting for the George Bush war machine and these guys talk about the level's switching on their trimmer? I wish that was my biggest problem of the day. I have never had that problem with the trimmer. Most of the hairs are captured in the hair cage. Let me tell ya, after I butter myself up for a nice shave, I let the Norelco do the work, and the result makes my face make a baby's butt feel like sandpaper."
1,"Mine just broke, company will not help me (bad warranty)","I bought this product in 2007, and it just broke for no apparent reason. It turns out cheap flimsy plastic does not last long. I did not drop it or submerge it in water, it just stopped. I contacted the company and they told me that they would do nothing to help me since i bought it over 2 years ago (2.5 yrs ago to be exact). I will never buy norelco again."
3,Happy Camper,"This is my first beard (mustaches aplenty over the years before now), and I used the reviews here to select a beard trimmer. It's a decent product for the price and seems to work well."
3,Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Beard and Moustache Trimmer,"This is a nice beard trimmer. However, it appears that the trimmer I received has a defective rechargable battery."
1,Doesn't Work!,"I gave this product one star because the trimmer works very well, but I have had many trimmers that worked very well. What I expected when purchasing this product, and it does cost a lot more than most, is the vacuum that it advertises to work, and it clearly does NOT! Oh it does suck some of the hair into the chamber, but it left just as big a mess of the trimmed hair all over my bathroom counter, as all the other trimmers, that don't have one. That to me is unacceptable, and I think Norelco should not be allowed to advertise as such!!! Don't waste your money!"
5,Give it To Tolstoy,"'Tornadoes' super warm beard trimmer and nose waxer was developed in the climates of Southern Arabia where men are known to never shave. This contributes to dry, coarse membranes which develop into flat tender sources for infection. This invention, a godsend, trims a beard, or shaves it all off, with the touch of a button and it also is great for bald patchy spots on top of the head."
1,Registration and Customer Service already a problem!,I am so mad about trying to register for this trimmer for warranty service on the Phillips Norelco web page that I can't actually say whether or not the trimmer is any good. I went on the web page for registration and they require you to answer a full privacy invasive survey to register the product. When I refused to do the survey to register and complained through the webmaster contact I then get an answer back from Phillips wanting me to waste my time calling an 800 number for Norelco - we all know how those calls go!! At least with the 60 day money back guarantee maybe I can calm down and decide if I like the unit - sure don't like the service so far!!!
1,Feel cheated,I ordered the trimmer but did not realize that I would not be getting the trimmer attachments
4,norelco t980 review,"Good product - vacuum (no stray bits of hair), self-sharpinging, holds a long charge, works in close quarters, very competative price"
4,Much better than the previous Norelco trimmers,"I've had a couple of Norelco trimmers in the past, most recently the T780, and have never really been happy. This newer, top-of-the-line T980 is pretty much what I've been looking for. It's solid, powerful and holds a charge through several trimmings. And the length setting holds! (Previous models would change settings as you were trimming because the change ring was right under your grip and moved too easily.) I think I'll keep this one for a while."
2,KISS,"I had a Norelco trimmer that lasted several years and loved it. The main reason I chose the T980 over the T765 is that it can be operated from the plug. However, the comb is difficult to re-attach after cleaning and ultimately busted completely after less than 2 months of use. The vacuum is a nice feature but the receptacle is not secure, sometimes sending hair flying everywhere. The worst part is the vacuum feature makes it impossible to use the bare blade to trim edges; you have to use a separate attachment for this. The button to operate the ""turbo"" feature (totally unnecessary) is extremely cheap and came off the first time I pressed it. Norelco / Philips trimmers are definitely the way to go, but don't shell out the extra money for the shoddily designed extra features. Get the T765, I just did as a replacement for this piece of dung."
1,does not cut close,"I was pretty disappointed when I found out that this shaver WILL NOT cut short hair, it has to be at least 1/4 inch or so before the blades can pick it up. That was a deal breaker for me."
3,"OK, but different","After 3, almost identical, super-solid, Panasonic trimmers over the past twenty years, they discontinued the model. This Norelco seemed to be the best non-pro model available, but it is quite different. Not terrible but it takes some getting used to. Power and battery life are fine, the vacuum feature is strange. Be careful the first few times, it does not seem to be doing anything because no hairs are flying around, but rest assured it is cutting. Because of the vacuum, you cannot do close trimming with the main head and switching heads is a pain. I can't imagine what it is like for people who buy trimmers with 3 or more interchangable heads. The T980 is OK, but I long for the old days. One head, one adjustable comb. Everything handled."
5,just perfect!,"The best of the best, fast, clean and very suitable. And the Amazon price is so good.I've been using trimmers since i was 20 and i can tell this is the best i tried.Go for it."
4,Norelco T980: Does what it says,"This unit has performed as advertised. Very little hair to clean up (might be poor technique on my part); keeps its charge, very efficient."
2,Waste of Money,"I have an previous Model of the same company trimmer and that is better than this. The vaccum is not good or better than the previous model. There is an obstruction for the saw that cut hair and it does not work smoothly. So, I'll rate it as below average."
3,Good but Not Long Lasting,"I purchased this for my husband not even a year ago and it worked great. We saved a lot of money on his weekly haircuts by using this. Only problem is it died on us yesterday. No given reason. Never dropped. Never wet. Nothing ever done to compromise the trimmer. It just stopped working. I will say, I placed an order for a new one the QT4070. I hope this one lasts longer...This time, I will keep the box ad the receipts. One suggestion: be sure to save the box and receipts so you can get it fixed or replaced with whatever warranty they offer."
4,Great beard trimmer,I have owned this trimmer for about a month. It does an excellent job. I love the vacuum. It keeps the hair from clogging the sink.The guard is a little delicate and needs to be handled with care. It is difficult to get it back in place without breaking it but as long as you are careful it will not be a problem.
2,Reviews apparently lie.,"After reading many reviews of this product I was sold and went ahead and ordered it. My mistake. The unit is apparently not designed for heavy, thick or long beard hair, as it does not trim that well, the vacuum just clogs up and then blades tend to pull rather than cut smoothly. The blade guard (?) just lets hair jam up against the blades, which again makes for a less comfortable trim. My plan is to now get a much simpler version of this type trimmer and go back to trimming as I have always done it."
4,Very effective face hair trimmer,"I like it. It cuts well. The little vacuum works for the most part. It does leave some hairs in the sink still, but just a bit and little enough to wash down the sink.The clean-out and length of cut adjustment are easy enough to use. The unit seems sturdy and it has plenty of battery life for me.The head is large enough that it does get cumbersome up under the nose. It's not ineffective, but just a little harder to get the hairs close to the nose."
4,better than prior version,"I really think the T980 is a major advance in technology over the proior model.The size and shape is comfortable; the vaccum, although not perfect, keeps your work area neat and relatively clean; the turbo function is a nice additional feature. Highly recommended"
4,4 1/2 stars,"It's a pretty good trimmer but I like my old one better that broke after 10 years of good use. Unfortunately they do not make the Maverick anymore, so I brought this one as the closest thing. I like the vacuum and turbo function. Also the carrying case is convinent. Over all I would highly recommend it."
4,Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Beard and Moustache Trimmer Review,"The T980 trimmer appears to be well made and the attachments are easliy removed and reattached. The Turbo mode doesn't appear to be needed with short beards. This is the first electric trimmer I've used so I'm not used to it yet. The flexing Guide Comb seems difficult to work with, probably due to my inexperience. The vacuum picks up most, but not all, hair."
4,No brainer!,"For a first time beard grower this was just what the doctor ordered. Very easy to use, the cut length adjuster is great, the vacuum captures about 80% with the turbo mode (bit noisy). I would give it 5 stars, but this is my first trimmer and have nothing to measure against. Overall happy with the purchase."
2,No match for a safety razor and scissors,"My husband is returning his Phlips Norelco beard trimmer because it leaves his beard shaggy and the trimmer doesn't make a neat, tidy line. He feels he does a better job with his old, non-electric razor and a sharp pair of scissors."
3,Cuts 80% well,"Of the trimmers I have used (have been through several brands), this one does a good job for the price. The vacuum does help reduce the cleanup, so that is helpful. It holds its charge well and gives sufficient warning when it is time to charge the unit.All beards are a bit different and this shave has a problem with the hairs just below my jawline. The hairs generally grow up toward the ear and this thing, on ""Turbo"" or not cannot cut them. With some success, I use a lower trim level, but generally, I need to do dangerous manual cleanup with the edger attachment.For my beard, at this price, I accept the extra work but will consider a different model/brand when it is time to buy another."
4,"Works pretty good,","The device works pretty good. I use it to just keep my beard under control.The vacuum wasn't as good as I expected, since it still misses a few hairs.The carrying case is pretty usefulfor the price its worth it"
4,Almost as Good as Expected,The Norelco Turbo Trimmer is great. My only problem is that when I try to trim my stash straight along my lip a little piece of plastic associated with the vacuum mechanism gets in the way. Otherwise it does a great job.
4,Good overall trimmer has some minor flaws,"I've had the same generic beard trimmer for 6 years now and it worked just fine but I decided to upgrade. This product had good ratings so I gave it a try. Overall it does an good job but the flaw lies in that it is super bulky and it isn't good for close up trims. What I mean by this is I have a goatee but because the trimmer is so large, it isn't good for trimming the mustache area right above the lip. For all other purposes and general grooming it is fine but the bulk is an issue for very detailed areas."
4,Good trimer for the $$$,"I bought this to replace and old Wahl vacuum-style trimmer I had for years. So far after a couple of weeks I can't complain about this unit. I have still not drained the initial charge, but it is a much better trimmer than the Wahl ever was. It gets about 95% of the clippings (I can trim with a dress shirt on) and I only need one pass, where the Wahl needed two or three. The trimmers adjustment knob does have some wiggle as other reviewers have mentioned, which hopefully will not get worse over time. I wish the trimmer guide was made out of better plastic, it looks/feels somewhat brittle. Lastly, though it has little plastic nubs so it doesnt roll, I wish it came with a stand or holder. My holder for my Wahl trimmer will have to suffice."
2,I've used better,"This trimmer is marketed toward facial hair and sideburns, and that's all it's good for. Anything finer than coarse facial hair jams up the vacuum system, so forget about buzz cuts or body grooming. When the vacuum part is backed up, it blocks hair from entering the blades, forcing you to clean it several times per trimming session. The vacuum is weak at best, and left me cleaning up almost as much hair from my counter as my previous, non-vacuum trimmer. Although I've enjoyed Norelco products in the past, this one has been a disappointment and will be on its way back to Amazon tomorrow."
1,Poor quality,I bought the T980 to replace a trusty T765 that had finally died after several years. Bad idea! The plastic hair chamber fell apart after just a few months. The length setting adjustment slips-- it doesn't lock in place as advertised-- so I cut my beard shorter than I wanted to. And the turbo function doesn't really help anyway; it drops a lot of whiskers. So I went back to the T765 and I'm glad I did-- fewer bells and whistles but it does the job!
3,Less effective than expected,"The adjustable blade guard works well, but it leaves an uneven cut. I'm not sure how it works on beards and mustaches, but wouldn't recommend it for ""touch-ups""."
2,Disappointed,After all the other reviews I read on this I guess I expected too much. It's another piece of China junk. The on/off switch is too large so it's constantly getting turned off in use. The adjustable attachment for length fell off between cutting strokes & I gouged me beard. That sucked!I was expecting a better trimmer.
1,Stay away from this trimmer,"I agree...with the negative reviews. I really like the guide on Norelco trimmers but that is about it for this latest model. I threw it away 2 days after I received it. I practically shaved off my goatee after it switched from the 3 to the 1 setting by itself. The vacuum doesn't work all that well and if you travel, it is so easy to accidentaly turn this on as it just takes the slightest pressure on the switch to start it up. Bad news all around."
2,"Good Shaver, Bad Trimmer...","This trimmer has a dial-like setting for determining the length of hair. Unfortunately the razor has a VERY bad spring/strength mechanism for holding the desired length in place; i.e.: I like to shave at a ""3"" and by the mere act of pressing the razor against my face [HEAVAN FORBID!!], it pushes the guide down to level ""2"" & ""1"" which are closer to the blades and lead to considerably shorter hair. I thought this was simply a manufacturing fluke when I first bought it, so I returned the trimmer directly to Norelco (very friendly service). The replacement they sent was 'stiffer' for a couple of months, but now it's back to the same ol' defect - I'm left with a beard that looks like I just haven't shaved for a week."
2,"Resonable trimmer, disappointing quality","I found this to be a pretty decent trimmer. It, well, trims. Adjustments work, the vacuum option does a reasonably good job, and clean up is easy.The detail tool is pretty darn small, not very practical for neck line cleanup.My biggest problem is that the vacuum hair container broke after about 10 uses (the plastic shell snapped off the clip-in part of the container). Very disappointing."
4,Good Job Philips!,"It's been about 3 months since my purchase. It's a great product. I experience none of the problems commented by the other reviewers. In fact, I pressed down on the head of the unit to see if I could get it to change length settings, but it didn't. My only complaint about the unit is that the button is very easily depressed when it's in the case. Wish the case was molded plastic than cloth. I kept hearing a humm while driving and then realized that it was the trimmer in my suitcase. Other than that, it's a solid product and I use it to shave my head as well as my beard."
2,Zoom dial broken,"Just like T970 this clipper has some design flaws that make it a poor choice for trimming. The zoom dial adjusts by itself even with the slightest pressure while trimming giving an uneven cut and closer trim than was desired. It needs to have a setting lock or the dial in a different location than right where you hold it. The vaccum function is so-so, I could live without it. Noise level is unusually high, but that's least of my concerns."
2,Best if used in the USA only,"In this day and age when almost all portable electronic products are universal power based, I regret to inform you that the Norelco Trimmers are mono voltage and cannot be operated outside the US. The unit can be charged only from (110v /120V). Neither the Philips nor the Amazon websites point this out to buyers.Since I travel outside of the US quite a bit, it is a big hassle to use this trimmer with a voltage converter. I wish Philips would seriously consider this issue and improve on the product, hence two star rating."
4,Speeds Beard Prep,"The T980 allows a quick and non-messy trim of my beard without the residue in the sink. Really appreciate the vacuum feature. No more damp toilet tissue wiping of the sink basin to clean up the clippings. The hinged trimming receptacle is easy to open and empty. By trimming twice a week, it keeps my beard at a consistent neat length. I like my new look and the tool that keeps it that way !"
4,Nice trimmer,This is a great trimmer and the vacuum works really well. I wish there was a 2.5 setting. For me the 2 is a little on the short side and 3 is a bit much. Besides that I love it!
4,The Best Trimmer I Have Owned to Date,"This trimmer works great. In fact, this is the first vacuum trimmer I have had that will catch almost every hair- I recommend pushing the turbo button to do so. I haven't had it long enought to speak for the longevity, but would definitely have to recommend it based on the experience I have had. I will agree with other reviews that it and its carrying case are a little bigger than I had hoped for the sake of portability, but I can get past that."
2,Useless.,"No good for a goatee.It won't fit under ones nose for mustache trimming. It's just to big and bulky. Might be good for shearing sheep. Don't be fooled by the money back guarantee, you still have to pay for shipping and insurance."
3,Just OK,"My old Remington was not giving me the shave I needed, so I thought this razor would be much improved. I am kind of disapointed. Works well enough, but doesn't shave very close. I'm beginning to think no electric does."
1,Amazon has this overpriced by a lot,after I had ordered this item I found the same one at TJ MAXX locally for $14.99. Amazon charged 39.99.I will never be sucked in again by Amazon!!!
1,Overpriced and Underperforming,"The Norelco trimmer that I bought around five years ago just died on me so it was time to buy a new one. I really liked the old Norelco so I thought I would get the same brand. This trimmer had all of the features that I wanted and I figured that since the price was so high it must ba a great trimmer. Boy was I wrong. I have a fairly thin curly beard that this trimmer just could not handle. It would not cut some places at all. Using the hilarious ""turbo"" button just makes it louder and does nothing for performance. After leaving my beard a patchy mess I decided to just shave the whole thing. Even with the guide off it could barely shave my beard. This trimmer is virtually worthless."
2,Norelco Turbo Vacuum Trimmer,"turbo is unnecessary, and there does not appear to be a benefit...vacuum is great addition to product...trimmer setting can change while in use if you push the trimmer too hard against your face...trimmer settings different than previous norelco trimmer (not a good difference)...for my beard, the previous product set on #2 was too close and on the turbo trimmer, the setting is not close enough (#1 setting is too close)...Carrying case is so soft it is useless if you travel and want to protect the product, and the second trimming head...previous product had a cord that plugged directly into the socket...this trimmer has a bulky transformer attached...removal of trimming heads is not easy enough...on occassion the trimming head came off so strangly that it was dropped on the floor...not happy with this product although, as previously stated, the vacuum is really a great addition"
5,Excellent battery life,"This is my second vacuum trimmer. I loved the first, but it eventually had the power circuit just die. The T 980 works even better for beard and mustache grooming. Haven't tried the alternate fine trimmer. This battery has many times the life of the older model it replaced after a month or so of use."
3,Not the best,"I have had several trimmers before and I wont rate this the best.....its vaccum feature does help a bit to reduce the mess but the I dont like the plastic movable piece which helps hold the hair and directs the vaccum. I like to use my trimmer to cut very close and never use the hight adjustment piece, but with the sliding plastic sheet getting in the way it gets difficult to get a close cut."
4,This thing sucks and I love it.,"I was skeptical about the vacuum capabilities when I first read about it, but after trying it I must admit that I'm very impressed. It literally catches about 90% of the hair, so there's way less to clean up after. I'm a hairy beast so I usually use it a few times a week and so far it's been great. If I was attracted to beard trimmers I would date this one because it's sexy looking and cleans up after me. Great price for a great trimmer."
3,"Decent Trimmer, Poor Vacuum, Guard Slips","I purchased this trimmer for my husband and he likes it for the most part. It trims evenly, is quiet and handy. It vacuums most of the hair, but he still has to stand over the sink because of the mess it makes. Otherwise, it's been a good buy, no problems yet.Follow-up: We returned the item because the guard slips. I would like to give this product a 1 star."
3,A good trim.,ni-cad batteries - so last decade.not replacable - in LESS than 3-5 yrs this is just trash.other than that. a very good shaver
3,"Not exactly as advertised, but good","The T980 is ok. It does trim your beard, although it does get all the hair, it does get some. It is easy to maintain because it does not require any lubrication and the blades are forever sharp. It is cumbersome to shave the hair right under your nose, I put on the attachment and trim the area manually."
3,"Excellent but this model still uses Ni-Cad battery, badly in need of an update","I've been using this one for two years and I have loved it. But I must say the battery is still old-fashioned Ni-Cad and the product itself hasn't been updated in years. Come on, in this day and age you can't get away with not changing a design for three years."
4,Great shaver,"I was happily surprised that the vacuum feature actual does work. Normally when i trim my beard the bathroom counter is covered in hair which is annoying to clean, but with this buzzer about 85% of the hair gets contained in the buzzer and is easily emptied. Also the range of buzzing lengths is very good. Over all so far i really like the buzzer."
5,Worth the price,Tried other trimmers that just couldn't maintain their settings. This one stays where you want it. Little tough under the nose but otherwise I'm very satisfied.
3,didn't last a year,"I enjoyed this trimmer at first, though I should say that it never cut as closely to my skin as I wanted it too. But after a year, the motor started jumping and though it works, it doesn't work as well."
5,Norelco T980 Beard Trimmer,I love this product! Works great on any length beard and vacuum feature eliminates most of the mess. I would definitely repurchase!
2,Poorly constructed,"Worked will at first then within the first couple months of ownership plastic parts began to fail, generally when the unit was being taken apart for regular cleaning."
5,Great Buy,"I just received the Philips Nerelco T980 and I am impressed. Feels great in your hand and trims amazingly well without shooting hair all over your bathroom. Only thing is make sure you open the hatch over your garbage because it doesn't slide out... It's just a hatch so beware. Overall, very happy so far. I also got it in less than 2 days after I purchased."
1,"A veteran trimmer says ""Not at all what I was hoping for""","I have had several trimmers over the years, and while I'm still using this after 9 months, it isn't what I was hoping for. My biggest issues are as follows... The beard setting that determines the length of the beard can shift unknowingly to a shorter length as the trimmer is pressed to the face. Also this unit cannot trim the area of the mustache just beneath the nostrils - I still need to use scissors. Finally, it is not easy to remove the beard length piece to perform a close trim right above the lip. I would not recommend this and I am only leaving this review as I am on Amazon looking for a new one."
3,fair but not great,"I encountered two main problems with this trimmer. First, the length setting dial tends to slip out of place - if you push the trimmer against your face with any pressure, it slips down a notch to a closer setting... not good if you're trying to get an even trim. Second, the vacuum feature, which only caught about 50% of the hair anyway, broke after about a dozen uses.Another minor issue I had was with the size of the unit - it is a little too big for the face, especially for the moustache area under the nose, and around the mouth. I find I need to resort to my older and smaller model to finish the job after I trim with this one.Overall I would not recommend this product - there have to be better models out there than this."
1,Disappointed - Poor design,"My Norelco T900 was great, but broke recently, so I went out looking for another one, only to find it was discontinued. Didn't see any Norelco trimmers comparible to my old trimmer. Bought a T980, took it home, and found out the first trim... its junk (I'm being nice with my wording). Overall, its too big to easily hold. Worst of all, the trim height setting moves when you press it against your face... so during my first trim, it ruined my goatee. Not a good trimmer, period. Too big, too much bling. I don't need a vacuum cleaner built into my trimmer."
5,This trimmer kicks butt!,"This thing is truly awesome... If you are more intelligent than a trained monkey you will have no problem using this trimmer for virtually any place you can grow hair...Works on beard and mustache great, cuts head hair, arm pits and trims other body hair places wonderfully!Works at full capacity even while plugged in and charging.Motor has 2 speeds. The vacuum function works really well, hardly any stray clippings on the sink. The hair collector cup snaps in and out with ease and rinses clean.I can't say much more raving about this without getting repetitive.My wife told me that I rave about how much I love it every time I use it that I should right a comment about it. So enough said... Buy it, it's absolutely wonderful for the price, especially when paired with the nose/ear/brow trimmer that I bought in the package."
4,ok,"Pretty good so far. Only issue is a lack of different size attachments for beard length and cannot easily trim mustache directly under the nose. Otherwise, I've got no complaints"
3,Pretty good overall trimmer,"i've tried quite a few, and this one is pretty decent.i don't get the ""turbo"" because why would you ever want less power? so i just put it on turbo all the time. that being said, some older trimmers (that have more metal) have more power than this one.the adjustable head works well, then you can take it off for close shave. it could be closer... not the quality of a barber's tool with a really clean, sharp cut.the vacuum feature is pretty gimmicky. yes, it does capture quite a bit of hair when you're trimming a longer beard (making clean up a bit easier), but this does not mean that hair does not fall. it does and you still need to clean your sink afterward.that being said, this is still my daily beard trimmer and i don't see a need to change yet, but i would if i found a better one."
3,Not as good as it looks,"Works well, but has three flaws:Length setting selector moves too easily and slips in use110 volts onlyclunky transformer on cord instead of built-in adapter.If you travel outside of North America, you have to carry a transformer with you to recharge this product."
4,So Far So Good,"I have a long beard, so I use the #9 setting. So far, this setting has not slipped to a lower setting, but I have been careful to avoid pressing the trimmer hard against my face. Beard trimming takes longer than I had expected. It takes time, and a lot of strokes to get all the hairs into the clipper teeth. The Turbo Vacuum does work well, and the chamber is large enough to hold about two weeks worth of hair growth. If you are not pressed for time, the T980 is a lot of fun to use."
4,nice,"Vacuum seems to work well - i like not making a mess of shizz. Charge is lasting a while, although i just got it so not much time to judge."
5,Works great,"Even at the normal setting, the vacuum works great. Battery life is good, and the comb doesn't really get in the way."
4,Good Trimmer,"After reading the negative reviews on this trimmer I was worried about the adjustable guard height because the folks rating this product with one star that was their biggest complaint. I can only assume that Norelco heard those issues because the locking mechanism on mine is very solid. I use a little bit of force to try to change and it did not budge.The vacuum is also more powerful than the previous Remington model I had. Although I did like the hair collection system on the Remington better. I little drawer pulled out that you could easily dump out in the basket and wash out if desired.The first time I opened the Norelco compartment I was holding the device vertical and the hair clippings spilled out. Now that I know, it is not that big of deal, just not optimal.I like the Norelco's sleek design and the feel of it in my hand. However, I liked the way the Remington could sit on the sink counter in the vertical position, taking up less counter space."
5,Excellent beard trimmer,Good at sucking up hair. Depth gauage works well. Other options for triming around lips good.
4,Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer- No complaints,"I bought the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer because the older version I had died after about 3 years of use. Overall, I enjoy using this trimmer. The adjustments stay in place and do not ""jump"" while in use. The vacuum doesn't get every little stray hair but I would say 95% are caught when I use the turbo function. The vacuum power of this model is much better than other brands I have tried."
5,THE GREATEST THING SINCE TRON,"Best. Trimmer. Ever.Nothing is perfect, but this gives us an idea of the perfect trimmer. Have at it!"
2,Slowly dying of thirst for some good Satch,"I am a long time Satch fan, have all the albums, etc. I use to love his music despite its sometimes shallow nature and its regular disregard for instruments other than the guitar. A lot of Joe's music is evocative and inspiring. This album, however, with the exception of 'searching' and 'bamboo' was a waste of money. Joe can't sing or write even passable lyrics. Some of the tunes on this album are so boring and lifeless that they sound like something a band of teenager might produce. In fact, my step-son just brought home a demo of his friends band that I enjoyed more. I forced myself to listen to this Satch album every day for a week looking for the good stuff and haven't listened to it since. It has nothing of the old Satch in it. Sounds a little like the worst of the Extremist. Buy Blue Dream, Crystal Planet or the self title instead."
1,Same song different day,"I bought it, I listened to it several times, and I hoped I would hear something new from Joe, but I haven't. What a waste that such a brilliant guitarist has confined himself to the myopic dimensions of rock. But, can we blame him...that's where the money is, and hey, we all gotta eat. I would dearly love to see Mr. Satriani stop playing the Testosterone Two-step and explore jazz, but it doesn't look like it will happen in my lifetime. This album is good...not great, but definitely good as are all of his other works. Buy it if you must, but don't expect to be surprised. It's just more of the same stuff Joe's been cranking out since 1989."
4,I'm happy but I'm not..,"I have to agree with Expected More (another reviewer). I have been a fan of Joe's since Surfing and am still waiting for Joe to branch out, take chances, surprise the hell outta me, with his music. I would love to hear this guy tackle a whole array of different styles, instead of the rock stuff. However, this being said, his playing is at top notch on this album. And it is great to hear real people playing those drums and bass as opposed to Engines which was his attempt at something different that didn't take as well as he was probably hoping for. Personally, I would love to hear more interplay of him playing both electric and acoustic. Maybe someday..But still, you should buy this album because it does deliver what Satriani does best..make no mistake..and it does have a few slices of something a little different from him.."
4,Satch boogies on,"Guitar hero Joe Satriani returns with what might be his best album since ""Surfing With The Alien"". Now in his late forties, Joe started out teaching guitar with students such as Steve Vai, Kirk Hammett and Charlie Hunter. Vai scored a gig with with David Lee Roth and praised his teacher and the rest is history. ""Is There Love In Space"" is simple, satisfying Satriani. Free of gimmickry, Joe just burns from start to finish. It's a myth that guitar instrumental albums are just for other guitar players. This is just great rock and roll and belongs in anybody's collection who appreciates an incredibly talented musician. Thanks Joe!"
2,Satch hits bottom,"This is the only Satriani album that I don't go back to and listen to again and again. Actually, that's not true; since I bought it, I go back to it about once a year and listen to it all the way through 3 or 4 times again. Every time, I come back to feeling disappointed by this album.I guess what it comes down to is that not one song here is memorable and not one song is catchy. With every one of his releases prior to this, I've wanted to listen to the new CD for 4-8 weeks straight, before I'd even think about putting another CD into my car or truck. With this one though, I had it changed by the end of the first week.I'm not saying that the CD is bad per se; I'm just saying that it isn't good and it doesn't sound like Satch."
2,meat and potatoes rock,"This is probably Joe Satriani's worst cd. There is very little creativity in it. Pretty much just formulaic rock. It's a huge step below some of his masterpieces, such as ""Crystal Planet""."
4,Standard Satriani,"This is a great album, but it's hard for a player like Joe to continuously push the bar even further ahead. There are some really cool tracks here like Gnaahh, Hands in the Air, If I could Fly, and the title track. Searching is great - very reminiscent of The Forgotten Part II from Flying in a Blue Dream. I don't much care for Joe singing, however, and the two vocal songs are only mediocre. If you love Satch, you'll most likely love this album, but it doesn't give you that ""holy %$&!"" feeling as did Surfing with the Alien and Crystal Planet. I remember the first time I heard Up in the Sky from Crystal Planet; the opening riff blew me away. Never quite got that feeling on this album, but I got enough other great riffs, melody and mood from Joe that I'm more than content. Rock on."
4,"MELODIC, BLUESEY, FUTURISTIC, HARD ROCK","If you like melodic hard rock guitar instrumentals you will like this album. It's not as hard as ""Surfing with the Alien"" and ""Crystal Planet"" albums but it's close. It has two songs with vocals ""Lifestyle"" and ""I like the rain"", the rest are instrumentals. ""Is there love in space?"", ""Just look up"", "" Searching"", and ""Bamboo"" are slow songs, the rest of the songs are harder and faster. ""Gnnaahh"" has a good melody as does ""If I could fly"" though I think ""If I could fly"" goes on just a little too long. ""The souls of distortion"" is good, Joe gets some weird sounds out of his guitar. I like Joe's hard and fast songs, I don't care for slow songs. There's 7 hard, fast songs and 4 slow ones. If you like hard, melodic, bluesey, futuristic instrumental guitar you will like this album."
3,Strange Beautiful Music Vol. 2,"Typical Joe staple as of late. This could have been the 2nd CD in a SBM set hands down. Nothing really jumped out at me as amazing trend-setting guitar work.Track 6 is the most likable song, the other stuff was carbon copy from the last record.For new Joe inductees, I recommend ""Flying in a Blue Dream"" and ""Crystal Planet""."
3,A mediocre cd from 'The Man',"Joe Satriani is the best guitar player alive, but this cd is not his best effort. If you want to hear him at his best, buy the (just released) ""G3 Live In Denver"" concert DVD (with Steve Vai and Yngwie Malmsteen), or guy his 'Extremist' cd or 'Live in San Francisco'.Even though I'm not real thrilled with ""Is There Love In Space"", I will buy the next Joe Satriani cd 'sight unseen' as soon as I hear it's available."
4,"Nothing new, but all very good","If you like Joe, then get this album. It's that simple. The best track on it, for me, is Searching, which gets 5 stars from me and to my un-practiced mind is in the top pantheon of guitar solos (along with Stairway to Heaven and Machine Gun, among others)."
3,Great fun... for 4 minutes,"I originally saw these at my child's school, where during an end of the year celebration, the Young Scientists teacher was shooting these rockets on the playground to the delight of 3000 kids. It was right then that I decided to get some for Father's Day for my rocket enthusiast husband and son.I ordered through Amazon and chose 2 days shipping. We were all very pleased at the packaging and how fast they arrived.Sadly, after 3 uses (and by that I mean shooting 3 rockets), the rubber band broke that launches them. Until them, they went high and everyone was impressed.The rubber band looked like it was dry rotting. Amazon did give me a full refund due to defective materials.I tried to email the company to ask for a replacement part as as of a week later, I haven't heard anything back from them."
3,Review of PVC Apron - Cat Breeds,"There were a bunch of PVC aprons available on-line in the U.K., but only this one in the U.S.--from a pet-care goods company. The ad did not specifically describe the apron, and I (a Briton) had to hope for the polyvinyl-coated cloth variety I have used for many years for wet work (including dish-washing). The illustration showed dog breeds and I was hoping for that, but got the one listed, Cat Breeds--not the most captivating artistically, but still functional. The fabric was the coated cloth I was hoping for. I think it will hold up fairly well."
2,Not So Good,"I just bought this, hoping, since I have been to the Buddha Bar in Paris many times, it's my favorite spot in Paris, that this compilation would represent the best of the world music groove that BB is famous for throughout the world. NOT EVEN. THIS IS AN INSIPID COMPILATION OF THOSE TRACKS THAT ARE THE LEAST INTERESTING-DON'T BUY IT-OTHER BB CD'S ARE MUCH BETTER."
3,Not recommended for first time cruisers,Although this book has good basic information it is several years outdated.
2,Great - Until it stops working!,"I purchased two of these monitors, one for my PC and one for my G5, and love the way they look. About two years after I got them, the one I use most just went black. If I turned it off and repowered it it would come on for a while, but then go blank again. Power lite stays on. I swiched the two monitors and the problem followed the monitor. It was not my computer, not teh power supply, but it was the monitor.I contacted NEC no luck, out of warrenty. Last NEC monitor I'll every purchase."
1,Expensive Junk!,"Hey Amazon, this doesn't even deserve 1 star.We had one for 3 years. I walked into the office, turned it on, and nothing. I tried another powerpack, I connected it to another computer, nothing. Tech support was no help. The warranty expired 2 months ago!! The best thing is how NEC brilliantly timed it to stop working after the warranty expired. Originally paid $650 through Tigerdirect.com who would only knock off $10 on another LCD. Never again with NEC (Mitshubishi)."
1,PEICE OF TRASH,I work in a Chicago Children's Hospital and we purchased 5 of these pieces of garbage to have 3 of them all have the same problem shortly after the warranty expired. Screen powers up for a split second then goes black. I swapped oout the power supplies to rule that out. It is definately the monitor. I would not recommend these to anybody unless they like to pay $300 for a doorstop NO MORE NEC's FROM NOW ON
2,Good for 3 years - Is this acceptable????,I've had my 1700V for 3 years now and was perfectly fine until recently I got the same error many others seem to have had. The screen goes black and if you power off and on it bursts into life for just a second. This is clearly a common fault with these monitors - but is that acceptable??? Not in my books. If this is a known fault and the life expectancy is only a couple of years then surely NEC should replace the units....Of course this is the REAL world and that just isn't going to happen...is it? No more NEC for me............
2,NEC Multisync LCD 1700V - good while it lasted!,"I purchased this monitor almost as new, and it worked great for about a year, then it just went black. If I turned it off and repowered it would come on for about one second, but then go black again. Power lite stays on. I hooked it up to two other computers and the problem followed the monitor. It was not my computer, but it was the monitor.I contacted NEC, no luck, out of warranty."
1,Not worth the money,Unless you have lots of money and need ways to blow it you can get smilaar quality for much less money. technically it's nothing special
5,HappyinPA,I bought this monitor after searching it seems like forever.I wanted a monitor for gaming but everything I read said that LCD's were not for gaming. Well I bought this monitor and I am extremely happy with it. The graphics are pure and clear. I am playing Asheron's Call 2 at the highest graphics settings and everything is crystal clear and nothing is lost. I am still amazed at how clear and vivid everything is. My computer is used for 90% gaming and I am as happy as I think I can be with this Monitor! I would not hesitate to recomend this 17 Inch LCD monitor!
5,A gem of a monitor,"When I was ready to purchase a new computer I went for the custom box only because the day I laid eyes on the NEC 17 inch LCD monitor I knew I wanted one. It's easy to install and the picture is so incredibly crisp and clear, corner to corner, top to bottom. The biggest selling point of this monitor for me, though, is it's weight. It's only 13 pounds. Thirteen pounds!!! If you're tired of slogging 44 pound CRT monitors, consider an LCD model, especially the NEC Mitsubishi 1700V-BK."
4,"Good, but not the best.",This is a pretty good Punjabi mix. It isn't as spicy as some of the others and it doesn't have that great of a mouth feel. I still think for the money the best Punjabi mix you can buy is the Surati Punjabi Hot Mix. Too bad Amazon doesn't carry that. You can find it at most Indian stores however or order it in a case of 15 from their website.
1,Not What I Thought,"I was really looking forward to getting this book for the purpose of using some of the sermon outlines in my preaching, boy was I disappointed. Essential this book is the published format of Foy Wallace's notebooks. This man was as scatterbrained as anyone I know. This is a difficult book to wade through. Don't bother buying it at any price."
5,Simply Amazing,Let Your Voice Be Heard is simply amazing. Cantus brings out all the joy and wonder of the texts. This is the kind of charismatic group we need more of these days. The blend and the individuality of their voices is simply astonishing. This is one of the best examples of contemporay choral singing. Whether you are an avid choral singer or someone who has never even been to a choral concert does not matter. You WILL enjoy this!
5,Simply the BEST,"I read the review in ""Stereophile"". It gave a very good review on this disc. I was not able to find it in my local store, so came to Amazon.com.This disc is the most addicted disc I have ever bought. The quality of recording was superb, their voices are gorgeous, and the selection of songs is fantastic.It is SIMPLY THE BEST.George Chew Kok Wah"
5,Love Jazz,"My dad listend to jazz and even though he is gone now, he would have loved this one. Listen to it all the time and think of him enjoying it too."
4,A vital resource,"This book is the first I have encountered to delineate Polish grammar in any systematic fashion. It covers all parts of speech and their various nuances in exhaustive depth. However, do not expect to learn the language solely from this book. It is intended to grammatical supplement to a more comprehensive course, such as Berlitz or Pimsleur.The only complaint I have against this work is its errors. They aren't plentiful enough for me to recommend a substitute (nor is there one!), but be on the lookout for inconsistencies. One example may be found at the top of page 21, where we are told that the default plural ending is -i, or -y following the letters g and k. In fact, it is the opposite, with -i proceeding those two exceptions. There are a handful of others, so read with skepticism."
4,"Really adorable, takes some breaking in","It does take some getting used to, the elastic heel, and so my feet suffered the first time I wore them but since then on it's been a happy relationship. I love the red color. It might be helpful to know that I usually wear a 7 in flats but I ordered a 7.5 and they were a perfect fit."
3,Interesting material,"This book explores the Tibetan concept of reincarnation, not necessarily the Buddhist concept of ""rebirth"". If you are looking for a book that explores the concept as it is understood by non-tibetan buddhists this is not the book for you. If you are interested in exploring Tibetan reincarnation's encounter with western scientific materialism then this book may be of interest to you. It explores the Tibetan idea and explains why westerners have difficulty accepting this idea. I'm not sure if it was intentional, but the book fails to mention that not all Buddhists have interpereted ""rebirth"" as ""reincarnation""."
4,Not for Nikons,"It didn't fit my Nikon 55mm lens, though it was the same size, but I had no problems returning it :)"
2,Not safe,When boys put this on they think they are The Thing and then try lifting heavy things and end up getting seriously hurt.
2,Swanstone Sink,I was very unhappy with the quality of this kitchen sink. It didn't have any gloss finish and it looked more like a wash tub.
1,HURTS!!!!,"This ring is gorgeous and so cute to look at, but it is truly PAINFUL to wear!!! It was cutting into my fingers after only a few minutes of wearing it. I bought it when it was $300 and I sent it back because it wasn't worth it to reset the diamonds in a less sharp setting."
3,"Perfect, but boring","Anonymous 4 has perfect intonation,perfect phrasing, but all this perfection saps the life out of some of this 14th century music. Of course, we will never know what Landini had in mind, but most other early music groups approach this music with a bit more earthiness. I have never been bored with ""Ecco la primavera"", but was here. Too perfect, lacking, well- spring. Unfortunately, there are few recordings of Landini available, and this one includes many previously unrecorded songs, so an early music aficionado may have to obtain this CD for this purpose."
4,"Enchanting & beautiful but yes i must admit, not enough...","This album is so beautiful ! like a sureal dream. but, i guess those lovley ladys will never know how sad it is that they dont combine period instruments with their repertoires : lute,medieval flute and harp will definitely (in top good tast and sound) could have made this experience more than perfect(!).i find it very difficult to listen to this album from the beginnig to the end without feeling exhausted mentaly.although, this unique ensamble of voices is the most delighting group in early music i've ever heard .i dont understand those who say that their interpetation of landini is boring ...try go walking in a forest (in day-light of course...) get stoned and listen to it while you walk... tell me now that it is not an absoloutly soureal/inlighting experience."
2,Book sucks!,"LAME ALL THE WAY PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS BOOK, THIS IS A WASTE OF PAPER AND A WASTE OF PEN INK."
5,The new puppy owner's guide and companion,"I love this book. I bought it on a friend's recommendation years ago and found it so useful that on the very rare occasions that I breed a litter, I include a copy with the ""New Owners Pack"" that goes with a puppy to its new home. The advice is very sensible and clear. Even dog owners of long standing can learn lots of new tips. The discussions on crate training and house training, preventing aggression and dominance problems and the advisability of obedience training are excellent but whole book is uniformly good."
5,How To Raise a Puppy you can live with,Excellent tool for raising a pup! Lots of great information! The name of the book is exactly what it does for you!!!!!
4,Good choice,"The book was suggested by my MIL who is a huge dog person. I think it did a great job of giving specific details with photos, which was nice. I feel like it was a helpful to remind me of all that is required to have a dog. I'm going to have all the family read it so we all know what is expected of us before we proceed with getting a dog. One thing I wished it talked about was incorporating a dog into a house with other animals. It didn't mention it at all. Overall, it was easy read, clear and to the point and will be easy to reference once we move forward and get a dog."
5,Required reading for my new puppy parents,I found this book to be an easy read with lessons broken down into bite sized pieces. he format will be quite helpful in guiding my new puppy parents in helping develop their dogs into good canine citizens.
5,How to Raise a Puppy You Can Live With,"This book is amazing. I think it is a must have for all dog owners, and a must send with your puppies. Everything the average puppy owner needs to know is in this book. If you're just looking for a puppy, read this book first. One of the best books on puppies I've ever read."
5,Covers it all!,"This book is a great ""dog bible""! It covers everything you need to know, from selecting a puppy to breeding it, and everything in between. It is easy and interesting to read, and is clear and concise, along with having great advice! I would recomend this book to anyone thinking about getting a dog!"
4,Aptly Named Book,Good book on training a new puppy. Goes beyond basics and looks at the various stages. Would advise anyone with a new puppy to read this and keep it handy.
5,GREAT for new puppy owners!,"I am a breeder & I give this book out with all my puppies! I did MUCH research on MANY books to find this one. It is the best out there to give to all my puppy buyers whether they are first-time puppy owners or have had dogs all their lives. After I picked this book, I found Dr. Threlfall DVM of OSU (world re-known for his work with dogs) also recommends this one! It is very thorough, leaving out nothing, from choosing a puppy/breeder to care & training, to adulthood. LOTS of pics!"
4,Great book,"This is my first dog book, i am looking into buying a puppy on summer vacations, and as a first time dog owner i want to be informed and prepared. I learned a lot about what is going on in my puppy's first year, and how to prepare for it. I liked it but i was somehow expecting more... over all, its a great book!"
3,Great if you get a newborn,"I just rescued a young dog - one to one and a half years old - and I thought this would be a great book to make some attitude adjustments for him. While the book is fantastic if you have the puppy from a very young age, it glosses over some of the behavioral adjustments with older puppies. I still picked up a lot of good pointers from it, so no complaints."
1,Does not give temperature,"It's simple: this device lets you change the heat setting of your heaters, IT DOES NOT GIVE YOU TEMPERATURE RATINGS. So, if you set it to high, your heaters will remain on until the ""high"" setting of the device is reached. If you set it to ""low"", your heaters will remain on until the ""low"" setting of the device is reached. Ridiculous isn't it? Why didn't they just include a thermometer to allow you to set the temperature you want the heaters to go on and off at, like the Hygrotherm the same company makes? If you don't mind doing the work of finding the corresponding temperature to the setting of this ""as useful as a doorstop"" item, then you will love it. Me, I don't want to waste my time, so I returned this and bought the Hygrotherm, and plugged in an adapter to allow me to plug in my three heaters."
2,NO temperature gauge,"A thermostat without a temp gauge is really not worth it , pay more money and get one with a digital temp readout. I sure wish I did.What blows my mind is I read all of the reviews and yet, somehow I missed this, rechecked and I guess no one thought it worth mentioning.So now I have to go purchase a good digital remote sensing thermometer, I will most likely end up spending more money then if I have purchased a Thermostat which included a digital readout of the temp its senor was picking up."
4,a good product,"The Reptitemp 500R is doing a good job of keeping my snake's cage a consistent temperature. I has 2 outlets to plug heating devices into. The protective cover does not fit on very well, but I don't need it. I like that it has Velcro to attach the thermostat to the side of the cage so that it can be removed and reapplied. The one thing I don't like is that the temperature dial only has a multi-colored strip to show how high or low it is. There are no numbers to guide you on where to set the dial. The other reptile thermostat I had did have a numbered dial and This was convenient. I remedied the situation by using an indoor/outdoor thermometer and set that probe beside the Reptitemp probe to confirm the temperature. This is how I know the Reptitemp is consistent in keeping the same temperature."
4,Good value option for heat control,"This product certainly does not have the ability to keep temperatures within a very specific range the way that thermostats that control the amount of electricity to the device do (my temperatures range from 89 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit), but if you're looking for a relatively cheap and reliable way to control your reptile's tank temperatures, this thermostat is a good value. Also,for being not much more money than most rheostats (dimmers), it's definitely worth getting especially if your ambient room temperature varies a lot."
1,Does not control temperature that well,"The package says that it will ""give you precise temperature control within the range of 70 F to 110 F"". Mine, set to the lowest setting (which to me should be 70 F) does not cut off until 89 F. There is nothing precise about 19 degrees over the set point. I am very disappointed with this product and want a refund. Based on my experience with the other Zoo Med products I purchased with it, Zoo Med would not be my first brand choice in the future either."
3,ok,ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo o o o o o o ooooooooo oooooooooo ooooooooooooooooo o o ooooooooooooo
4,Does the job at a great price,"it does what it's supposed to do, and within a fairly tight temperature range (likely tighter than plus or minus 2F) as long as you're not constantly trying to adjust it. Of course it doesn't have a temp display but it's designed to be a set-and-forget unit anyway. The temp probe is a little bulky when it comes to taping it to a heat mat. And it doesn't have a fail-safe so technically could conceivably fail closed and allow full power to the heat mat. You need to make sure your heat mat (or whatever heat source this is controlling) is sized appropriately to the tank/cage so that at 100% power for hours, the temp in the entire cage doesn't become dangerous to your pet. But if really you need a fail-safe, you need a more expensive unit. For the price, this does what it's supposed to."
2,Broke 5 months later,"I bought this for my hedgehog's cage and haven't been very happy with it. I found it was a bit difficult to regulate and the temperature didn't always seem to hold steady. In hindsight I wish I had gotten a digital thermostat so I could know what temperature I was setting it to, and it looks like now I will go ahead and do that since this one doesn't work any longer. The other day I noticed the light was on, however the temperature on the digital thermometer I keep in his cage was really low. When I felt the lamp, it was cool and I realized the lamp wasn't on. I thought it might be the bulb, however when I plugged it into the wall, the bulb heated up, so it had to be the thermostat. Unless you are really tight on funds, I'd recommend going ahead and spending a little more on a higher quality thermostat. Five months is not very long, especially considering it just sat on top of his cage with me occasionally adjusting the temperature."
2,Stopped working,"I used this for my Ceramic Heat Emitter set up for my hedgehog. The dial sucks, it goes from low to high. It would be nice if you could set it to a temperature. About two weeks after having it, it stopped working. The light would be on but the CHE would be off and when I came home from work one day my hedgies cage had dropped about 5 degrees. Do not recommend."
4,"works great for baby chickens, too","I bought this sensor (also a clamp light and cermaic heat emitter from same manufacturer, ZooMed) to brood some baby chicks. It works very well for my little brood of nine. The only very mild criticism I have is that the temperature dial doesn't have numbers on it so you will need an additional thermometer to actually tell the temperature inside your aquarium or whatever. Getting up to the right temperature takes some fiddling and takes time but once that temperature has been reached, this unit is very reliable for keeping the heat steady. It will save you some electricity because the unit cycles the lamp or emitter off and on but still maintains the desired temperature. So I'm happy with it, it does what it claims to do, very reliable and was a very good buy for me."
1,Bad DVD players,"I had this dvd player for about 2 years and it all of a sudden just quit working. It would freeze all the time in the middle of a movie and then one day it just wouldn't turn off, eject, or anything. I do not recommend sanyo DVD players."
4,People Get Ready...,Ran across these gents when I finally scraped enough money together to buy the excellent *Goodbye Babylon* and the 1st cd had *Rock of My Soul* on it. It blew me away. I played it off and on for the next few weeks. Perfect harmonizing. Beautiful Bible stories rendered in song. It doesn't get much better than this.
1,Obviously Stacked Favorable Reviews,"When a product mysteriously has 6 reviews all from April 5 and 6, all written in the same style, with the same exclamation points everywhere, the usual marketing superlatives like ""fantastic"", ""amazing"", etc., the entire rating system becomes corrupted for legitimate users and legitimate reviews. Marketing people will need to learn to let actual USERS review products."
2,Garbage Software,"One of the absolute worst software graphic packages I have ever used. Glaring typos on the interfaces, buggy, screen freezes, cannot make gifs, when you close then open a project your graphics show up mis-aligned, it double-saves (i.e. one copy and then a sub folder with another copy??). If you are trying to use transparent backgrounds you are in for more surprises... For instance, the transparency background will appear white after closing and opening and you will have to start again.Cut and paste does not work, updates do practically nothing, etc. etc. etc. I would love to sell this back to the company and also charge them for all my wasted time. Go to GIMP or find some other product. Knowing what I know now after using it I would NEVER have bought Logo Design Studio. Totally lousy product."
1,Shocking,"Will Amazon allow an accurate, negative report of a product which has been bought by a bona-fide consumer? Let's see shall we.This piece of software is terrible. It is painfully slow (even on a Mac 2 x 2.5 ghz dual intel with 3.5 gig of RAM) - it has amateurish preset graphics, the library of images is tiny, it is difficult to preview effects, drawing is massively limited, and it has NO UNDO FEATURE. This means that if you make a mistake, and accidentally delete a design or part of a design that you may have spent hours on, there is no way of getting it back. If it does have a (well-hidden) undo feature either on the Mac or PC, then please let me know.I might upgrade my rating to two stars."
1,More bugs than fonts,"I have this company's Logo Design Studio 3.0 and have found it to be completely useless, even for the simple job i purchased it for. I have spent frustrating hours with a confusing interface creating a simple logo, saved it, and returned to find the logo completely corrupted and unsalvageable. Even if you try to use their preloaded logos, the same thing happens. I have tried this on 3 different PCs with both Vista and XP OS and have gotten the same results. I have tossed this garbage in the trash and am now in search of a reputable software company who makes a simple and workable logo program."
1,Rookie TRAP CRAP Product,"I admit that I'm a rookie at this, but stay far away from this product. It's 375mb of junk.No-refunds. No Support, No contact number... check their website."
1,Not great at all. Clumsy looking logos.,Too bad this is such rubbish.I have purchased a few of these logo making tools.This one is not the one I am going to keep.- Steve.
1,You get what you pay for,"If you order a cheap, poorly-reviewed, crappy piece of software, you get cheap, poorly-reviewed, crappy logo designs. Don't waste your money. Save up for the Adobe Design Suite or, hey, pay a designer to make your logo for you.So bad, it might bend the space/time continuum."
2,SummitSoft Customer support is very poor,"I wanted to try out this new product.I gave Summitsoft my order ( and credit card ) and waited patiently for them to reply and send me the software! I've now waited almost 2 weeks. NO reply at all. Very frustrating. Makes me think they're a bit of a cheez company.Whatever this new product is, they're not doing a very good job with their first impression.-D"
1,SAD DISAPPOINTMENT - Same Old Same Old canned spam,"I didn't actually purchase this software, but rather used it on a friends computer, and I must say this is certainly one of the cheaper [read: low quality] software packages on the market. This software is something I would expect to find in a 99 cent bin.Save your time and money, shop for something else. Like dubyuhdubyuhdubyuh-daht-thelogocreator-daht-cahm"
1,Other reviews look like scams,"I would have liked to have had more reliable reviews here. It's pretty clear from looking around that most of the ""reviews"" here are not impartial and are just hype.Consequently, I won't be buying this product."
5,Right on the money,"Mr. Haas does it again. I have periodically followed the original Eat To Win diet with great success, now this. The system is sound and proven in the field. I currently practice mixed martial arts, and run through some vigorous training sessions... This is the diet I need to perform... I challenge any Atkins buff to train as hard as these fighter's do while eating the way they do.... You career won't last long, neither will your fights...."
4,Eat To Win 21st Century,"I followed Haas' original ""Eat To Win"" about 20 years ago. It was pretty strict but absolutely amazing! Now, my kids are into competitive sports, and I know that with all the distractions and conveniences of today's disposable society, there's no way, that they'd follow through with the strict guidelines in the original. So, I'm quite pleased with the newer version. Easy read, easy to follow guidelines, with quick & easy recipes. I personally still choose to stand behind the original format but this updated version makes it much more manageable in today's convenience oriented culture."
4,"What happened to the ""Doctor"" title?","I have a copy of the original ""Eat to Win"" published in 1983, written by Dr. Robert Haas. Why did the original book give him the prestigious Dr. title while the newest edition says he has an M.S. degree? I am not questioning the value of the content - but I am very confused when I see claims of earned degrees appearing and then disappearing."
4,"Good, but.....","I am somewhat disappointed that most of the book was spent bashing the High Protien, Low Carb diets. I would have rather read more about how the use the Eat to Win lifestyle."
1,Pictures are nice,I was really excited when I purchased this book because the pictures are nicely laid out and show great detail. But there are so many errors it is tough to justify spending $24 on this book. It includes pictures of 1969 cars stating they are 1971??? Any mopar nut would know that from 50 feet away. Plus there are more errors where there is not enough space here to include. It is too bad because the book looks real nice but never judge a book by it's cover. The author could have any Mopar fan to proof read it and point out all the mistakes. Mopar fans are serious about Chrysler cars and know them inside and out.. Expensive picture book!!
1,The book of errors,"It's hard to believe that a book with so many glaring errors could make it to print. Hey, nobody knows it all, but a Ford enthusiast could have probably done a better job. You would think that if someone was writing a book about a certain topic, they would research the information. Isn't that the reason we read books in the first place... to expand one's knowledge? It is filled with some nice pictures though, just way too many mistakes."
5,When hairstyling is....FIERCE!,"""Hair World"" is a fascinating glimpse into the life of competitive hairstyling. This documentary tracks the progress of the US team as it heads (so to speak) to Moscow. The competitors come from diverse backgrounds. Some are artsy, others are working class. All want to dazzle and impress. Their hairstylings are like nothing you see in daily life (but they are the sort perfect for the runway)It's a real-life ""Ugly Betty."" At one point, the hair salon is damaged by a flood. The competitors have creative ways of dealing with stress. They talk about their art. This documentary is a delightful combination of ""Ugly Betty"" with its story of ordinary folks going into the realm of haute couture,with the affection of a Christopher Guest mockumentary,and the campiness of Heidi Klum's Project Runway. As Tim Gunn says,""Carry on."""
2,Disappointing,"I've always been a Bushwick fan, and really liked the first couple of cuts (this is what I was expecting). Then the album takes a turn becomes less than his best. You can still see he has talent, but maybe he's lost the commitment for tight rhythms. Overall it's very monochromatic. Also the art work is very cheesy."
2,NO,"wat are people talking about this isn't a alright album or a good album it's trash....more than half of what he's rappin' he already said on his other albums. this album is [...] this beaat aren't like the dirty south i remember bushweik usin' on his classic albums,Little Big ManandPhantom of the Rapra. this album is actually terrible get Little big man and phantom for some classic bill"
1,not satisfied at all,"I did not get what I ordered. I got Eau de parfum of ""Eau de Joy"" instead of Joy. The smell is completely evaporated within half an hour. I am very dissatisfied and would like a refund."
5,An awesome book,"This book is very informative and insightful. The pictures offer children a comprehensive look into life on a cattle farm. They go very well with the text, and therefore allow kids to picture what they are reading. A great gift for children of all ages!"
1,OMIGOD! (can't give zeros?),"Couldn't even read this one. I'm sorry, but can it get any worse? I mean right away they start talking about sex and whatnot. I mean, you KNOW what'll happen, can't they at least make it interesting? And the author keeps on saying the same things over and over again. And then almost right after the two meet (and the girl grabs the guy in the crotch) they meet again, this time naked. There's no real foreplay, no imagination, it's all leading up the ultimate end which will be marriage while using the same words over and over and over and over again. EWW! Yes there are some good reviews. I only looked at them and thought well they liked it. Don't know why, it was absolutely insufferable.Spend your money and time somewhere else, like ... Harry Potter ..."
2,Regency England or Frontier America?,"What has happened to the classy writing we had come to expect from KEW's earlier books. At times I had trouble believing she had actually written this book or that it was supposed to be Regency England.The constant use of `orbs', wouldv'e, and couldv'e was bad enough but `gotten',`pesky', `lit out' and `socked' american words not used even in modern England all served to spoil my enjoyment. Then came `boardwalk'!! PLEASE this is ENGLAND? Publishers please note, if you re-print, TAKE THIS WORD OUT."
1,Is this the same author that wrote Shana???,"I normally read a book in a couple of days... this one took me almost a week. I kept reading and hoping it would get better but it kept getting worse. I dare say it is the worst book I've read. The ploy... very dull, not to mention the characters. I have a hard time believing this is same author that wrote so many wonderful books! What a dissapointment!!!"
1,A reluctant reviewer,"Shanna, The Flame and the Flower and Ashes in the Wind are among my all-time favorite romance reads, but I couldn't finish this one. The cumbersome prose made it painful to read, and I didn't believe that beautiful Ariana--at what, age six?--could have been that devasted by Colton's rejection."
1,The Reluctant Suitor,"I am just wondering who really wrote this book and A Season Beyond a Kiss. They are written the same, and do not seem to be at all like Mrs. Woodiwiss other romances. I wanted to read the Birmingham novels in order of dates and not how they come out of order and that book was just like trying to read the Reluctant Suitor, too wordy and very boring trying to follow along. But THe Flame and the FLower and The Elusive Flame are written so well and I got caught up in it. I was just disappointed Jeffreys story got killed by writing. I liked the Birminghams, and Jeff sounded so exciting in the first novel, but to much of a dandy in his novel."
1,Can you give negative stars?,"I picked up this book in an airport as a last resort to Tom Clancy. I came to the conclusion, about 40 pages into the most stultified prose I've ever read, that I would have been better off with Tom Clancy. Even the BEST author can't make an introduction of 8 people last 80 pages and keep the dialogue flowing. Her characters have no personality; I could not find anything likeable about Colton, and Ariana came off as a silly bimbette. Plot? I couldn't parse through the prose far enough to get to a plot, although of course Roger did it; that he was a villain (whatever the crime) was obvious from his first entrance. This author needs a good editor and some lessons in character development and how to write clean, clear dialogue with some wit and humor. Euw. Bad book. Bad book."
1,Horrid!,"Is this supposed to be a parody of every negative thing that can be said about romance? If not, it should be. Perfectly ponderous prose. Cardboard characters whose often mentioned traits are more irritating than intriguing. A confused, convoluted plot line. The only thing ""magical"" about this book is how short-lived wolfhounds are bounding about at 18. Save your money. I wish I had."
1,A Disappointment,"I usually love Kathleen Woodiwiss' books and have been reading then for years but I was extremely disappointed in her lastest book. I found it very hard to get into reading this book. Usually I am swept away from the beginning of her books but this one was long, drawn out, and very hard to follow. It wasn't until about 250 pages in did the story finally get interesting but even then, it was lackluster. There were too many storylines and she took forever to explain such simple things! I felt like the first chapter when Adriana and Colton first met again lasted an entire year, not the 15 minutes is actually was! I truly hope that her next novel is comparable to her past books and not this one. It would be a shame to see such an excellent writer waste her talents on another disappointing book."
1,Boring and Confusing,"Actually I didn't want to read this book but I had to review it for a German publisher and I hated every minute I had to spend on ""The Reluctant Suitor"". It's such a confusing and badly written story. Don't get me wrong, I really loved Kathleen E. Woodiwiss earlier books but her downfall came with this two strange short stories and the book ""A Season Beyond a Kiss"". This new book is simply not worth the hardcover price and the effort you have to put in it for reading!"
1,A reluctant reviewer,"The Flame and the Flower, Ashes in the Wind and Shanna are among my all-time favorite romance reads, but I honestly could not finish The Relactant Suitor. The cumbersome prose was painful to read, and Ariana's devastation over Colton's rejection--at what, age six?--was ridiculous."
2,I Miss The Kathleen Of Old,"I can't express how very sad I am about this book. I am a huge Kathleen fan and I just can't understand what happened to her to change her writing style so dramatically. Her earlier books were far and above the top in excellence. This book was hard to read and easy to put down. It took me from first release to just now to finish it. I gave her two stars simply because she is Kathleen and I adore her earlier work. Instead, read my favorite by her ""A Rose In Winter"" or another favorite ""Ashes In The Wind"" You'll be much, much happier."
1,A reluctant fan meets reluctant suitor.,"The best book I ever read is KW's ""Shanna"". I keep extra copies around just to loan out. And I keep waiting for another good book from her and have been disappointed. But I keep hoping, so I eagerly bought this hardcopy hot off the press. I've read 100 pages and still don't know what its about. A real waste of money. Thanks for Shanna BUT Sayonara, Kathleen."
1,When did KW lose all respect for her readers' intelligence?,"I have read this author since the 70's (THE FLAME AND THE FLOWER and THE WOLF AND THE DOVE). I was crushingly disappointed in this new offering. Does she not have an editor to tell her that she has had so many of characters musing over the SAME THINGS ad naseum? Does she think her readers cannot hold onto those thoughts for more than a few pages? The story plods along with our characters standing around talking. I kept thinking, something will happen soon, nope, they're just going talk some more and muse again on the same ideas that were introduced in Chapter 1. I have always picked her new books up faithfully on the strength of her early works. Well, from now on, maybe I'll just read THE WOLF AND THE DOVE again."
1,Did she really write this?,"I have been a fan of Ms. Woodiwiss's for over 25 years and this book is awful! Where is the character development? There is so much exposition I skipped pages. After forcing myself to complete the book, I seriously had to ask myself if Ms. Woodiwiss actually wrote this book. It is so far off of her usual brilliance that the only saving grace is that I read the library's copy and didn't waste any money on actually purchasing it first.If you like good historical romance, do NOT read this."
4,"Don't be ""reluctant"" to read this!","The final book I read authored by KEW after spending the last few weeks immersed in her books...A very good book with the setting in England (Bradford on Avon area) just after the Battle of Waterloo. The heroine (Adriana) is a feisty independent 22 year old who has been betrothed since a child to a neighboring family friend (Colton), who is just as feisty and independent as she. Of course, the usual villains do their utmost to prevent a union between the two, but love always prevails, right? LOL.. Some interesting plot twists help to tie the story up as well."
1,Former Reader of Kathleen Woodiwiss,"I read Kathleen Woodiwiss's earlier books -- Wolf and the Dove, Flame and the Flower, Shanna. Those were her best. The last two books that she has put out have been horrible, and this book was the worst. I thought after her last book, this would be much better. I could not get over the fact that she kept going over how ""Colton acted when he left home and how horrible Adrianna felt."" That line went on throughout half the book."" ""Adrianna couldn't have been that devastated -- she couldn't wait to marry him. If it was that bad -- she should have married someone else."" After reading this book, which I took out from the library (Thank God), I have given up reading anything that Ms. Woodiwiss puts out."
1,I can't finish it,I don't think I can finish this book. It is just awful.Maybe the only way to make it enjoyable would be to read it as a group and then get together with a few bottles of wine and review the more sordid passages. With enough alcohol that might be a hoot.
1,more fun reading the reviews than the book,"When I saw this at the library I couldn't believeI had missed the latest. Not that it mattered!The previous reviews here are so funny and true.This book is awful. I didn't finish it andIt made me downright mad! How could this author have written Ashes in the Wind? A Rose in Winter? My personal favorites, but I love Shanna and The Flame and the Flower and The Wolf and the Dove.I will probably still try to read any more that come out in hopes that the grandeur will appear again but really, WHAT has happened to her?"
1,Deeply Disappointed,"I have been reading Kathleen Woodiwiss for the past 25 years and I must say this is the most disappointing work I have seen from her. Both main characters are unlikable and the side story of the baby and 'dead' mistress/wife who pops up later takes away from the relationship. If you collect all of Kathleen's books I would wait until this one comes out in paperback. If you must read it now, please check it out from the library and save yourself some money."
2,"Strong story, pitiful prose","I tossed ""A Season Beyond a Kiss"" after 20 pages because of the horrible prose. I was very interested in the story of ""The Reluctant Suitor"". As I began reading, the over-abundant use of words like ""orbs"", ""protuberance"" (who says that?) and ""manly"" (used with countless nouns and verbs), among other apparently favorite pretentious words, the horror dawned on me - ""Oh my God! This is that same author!"". I liked the characters and story of this book very much and only they kept me plodding through the nearly unbearable prose. Some sentences were so long and convoluted with excessive (but weak) adjectives, poor choice of synonyms and unnecessary drivel, that at the end of them, I thought ""huh?"" and had to reread them to find out what the author was trying to say. It's only a romance novel, not quantum physics - I shouldn't have to work so hard to follow the author's thoughts. I'll be avoiding Ms. Woodiwiss's work in the future."
1,Not really very good,"I just laughed when I read the comment about the word ""orbs"" being over used. I started underlining it just for fun and I was astounded at how much the author used it and that it was rarely used for the same thing (eyes, (...), etc.). No, I did not enjoy this. I have only ever read A Rose in Winter and had such great expectations for this book. It was so overly dramatic and I was so tired of hearing about Colton's large manliness. I really felt as though I were reading a novel by an amateur. If this is your first book of Woodiwiss' to read, give her others a chance before you give up on her entirely. I plan to."
1,Don't judge Kathleen Woodiwiss by this book!!!,"I read Shanna when I was 16 (24 years ago) and became a Kathleen Woodiwiss fan for life- until now. The Reluctant Suitor was horrible! I could barely get through it!! I can't believe the same woman who wrote Shanna, The Flame and the Flower, etc. could have possibly written this empty, boring, shell of a story. I rolled my eyes and skimmed paragraphs just to get through it. Colton's character was shallow and undeveloped and the whole story was predictable and poorly written. I'd hate to see Ms. Woodiwiss retire but, in my opinion, her first books were definately her best. If you are new to Woodiwiss, take my advice and read her books in chronological order and you will not be disappointed!"
1,The Reluctant Suitor,"As a life long KW fan, I was very disappointed in The Reluctant Suitor. KW should have used less lengthy description and concentrated more on development of the plot. I found myself skimming through paragraph after paragraph searching for the story to unfold. It never did."
3,Definitely Not Her Best!,"Ms. Woodiwiss, please re-read The Flame and The Flower so you can remember what truly entertaining writing is about. The last one-third of this book was quite entertaining as all the stories FINALLY entertwined, but the first two-thirds were dull and slow. Both the main characters seemed stupid, particularly Adriana, who was dull and spoiled, with little but her beauty to recommend her. Ms. Woodiwiss also seems to have a fascination with the word ""orbs"" as she must use it at least a hundred times in the book, to describe the characters' eyes and breasts. Not her worst, but absolutely not her best. That honor, in my opinion, still belongs to The Flame and The Flower."
3,Waiting,"I have waited a long time for Kathleen next book. This one is pretty good, except that Adienne is kind of self-fish and stuck in the past. It takes most of the book to get past that, nearly everyother page has her whinning about her heartbreaking. They refered the Lady has being stronger., yet gentle. But her living in the Past and they way she kind of treats Roger like a lap dog in the Begining. and then the usually chip on his shoulder. I just felt the chartakers were a little flat. If this is your first book with her I would read this one first, then work my way to her 2 best ""The flower and the flame"" or ""Ashes in the Wind."" I think the editer she let Kathleen Woodiwiss write the stories we have come to love no matter whither short or long"
1,Trying To Be Jane Austen,"This book is truly awful. I just wish I had read the reviews before I spent $7.99 plus tax on it. I have loved many of this author's previous works, so I assumed it would be safe to spend my money. I was wrong. I wish I could get my money back plus damages for having to read this muck. It seems to me she is trying for the style of Jane Austen, but failing miserably. Note to the editors of the book: Just strike every other word from the text and this book will make more sense than it does now."
1,"I'm ""relunctant"" to ever read anything by this author again","This was perhaps one of the worst books I have ever read. I finished it solely out of a sense of duty (for I hate to leave something I started unfinished). The plot was thin and the characters abrasive -- especially considering that their ""love"" seems forged out of an obsession with the superficial. The reluctant Colton only considers pursuing Adriana because of her pulchritude and throughout the novel her beauty and his handsomeness stands as the only foundation of their relationship. In my opinion, neither have redeemable qualities except token scenes where Adriana conveniently demonstrates maternal ""instincts"" with local orphan children.It seems not a page goes by without Colton praising Adriana for beauty that is ostensibly not only second to none but practically rivals Venus. (...)"
1,did someone steal K. woodiwiss's name?,i wish they offered a zero star rating option. There is no way that Kathleen Woodiwiss wrote this book unless it was a desperate attempt to overcome writers block. This was the worse book i've read in decades. I have all K.W's books but have found that i am more and more reluctant to spend the money to buy them as they seem to be getting progressivly worse.
1,Huge Disappointment,Kathleen Woodiwiss has always been one of my favorite authors. I can't tell you how many times I have reread Shanna and Ashes in the Winds. There is no story here until the last twenty or so pages. Three chapters to get out of the front hall?!? I finished the book but will not be rereading it. I think that Ms. Woodiwiss missed many opportunities to turn this into at least an interesting story. Save your money if you feel you must make up your own mind--go to your library.
1,heavy going,"WOW, how many words can you take to describe one scene. The authoress has tried to imitate an old style of writing and ended up with text as heavy as molasses. You keep waiting for something. . .anything to happen and when it does (first real scene takes place in a bathtub of all things) it is totally unbelievable as a set up and the dialogue inappropriate for everyone in any era.It got so bad that about page 114 I put the book in the recycle box.final judgement. unfinishable."
1,The Reluctant Suitor,"I am a life long KW fan that was VERY disappointed with The Reluctant Suitor. The story lacked any type of plot development as KW concentrated on her poor use of sentence structure. I would classify this novel as an ""evocative"" boor that ran-on about nothing for 300 pages. It would have been a fine short story."
4,Was good in '04,"Amazing processor... For back in the day. This could even play a few games from '07/'08 But it's 2012, even a $20 Dual Core E2140 will blow any Pentium 4 to high hell! Justmake sure you have a motherboard that handles it."
3,good music,"Jah Mason's album is very good... Even if you are only familiar with the hit track, ""My Princess Gone"", you will be satisfied. I'm not going to say it is an all-time favorite album yet--but if you like what you have heard of Jah Mason, you need to give this album a try."
2,Greatly Exceeds Low Expectations!,"Low budget films have their charm. I watched this preview with a slight smirk on my face, but as it progressed my expressions changed to sheer delight. I love watching amateur acting and shoddy camera work because I know it's practice for more amateur acting and shoddy camera work. This movie, like many other films of its caliber aren't gonna move you with empathy --maybe you are noticing that from the shrewdness of this review. This type of movie is sure to give you a few laughs, and checking it out is worth the small rental or purchase fee. I guarantee you'll get a unique experience not offered anywhere in a major theater or even the most extensive Netflix Horror Movie list. So drop your change in the bucket and support the small guy, remember the little people, and see a film re-dedicating our shared love for the ""low budge"" horror picture."
2,No suprises.,"Was an ok attempt for a ""Hey-lets-get-our-pals-and-make-a-zombie movie"". Just wish that they didn't always have to just happen to have a garage band buddy to supply the soundtrack. Also, heads up, its a 20 min. short film. Hope they keep trying."
4,Great starting point for a discussion,"My husband and I both read the book, and after some discussion, have decided to give it to future aunts, uncles, and grandparents. I agree with some of the reviews that indicate that the author's approach to the reader (extended family) can be somewhat condescending - or even insulting. However, I think that with an introductory conversation (e.g. ""Clearly, the book is written for someone less informed than you are, but we thought it brought up some points you might find useful""), it can be a great way to both educate and open communication channels with extended family."
5,Best book ever!,Best book you can buy for families! Exactly what I wanted them to know. This is for families not quite supportive yet.
5,A Great Resource,"I enjoyed this book and it was invaluable in helping me educate extended family about adoption. The language is clear and concise, it speaks directly to the family members/friends of adoptive parents, and it addresses many of the concerns that family members or friends may have, regardless of whether they blurt it out or not.As adoptive parents, we often spend hours poring over books, talking with others who have adopted, and researching our choice. Our extended family members often do not make the same educational journey we do, so it's helpful to have something to gently illustrate topics like adoption myths, respectful language, privacy for the child, etc.I highly recommend it."
3,I had to return it,"Although I'm sure that there are people out there who did not find it annoying to be talked down to, I did. So I have a hard time giving a book to my family when I find it condescending, myself. I don't think it will help my relationship with them to give them this book."
1,Am I the only one who isn't wowed?,"I thought the book was trite and a play on her other books. She tries to get mileage out of an old and tired concept. If you read her other books you don't need this one. Best suggestion is to use the library, not a book worth hanging on toSimply put there are better books out there on adoption."
2,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!,"So call ""LEAN Manufacturing Implementation"" title is very appealing. Very bad decision buying this book. I have several other books on the subject. From Mr. Pyzdek to Womack (warranted satisfacton with this guy's book) and some other japanese authors on the subject. I paid $6.00 for the book ""The machine that changed the world"" I learned more reading this book. This book is highly priced. Shame on APICS backing up this kinda of got-to-write-a-book authors. I hope the author could read this comentary and give me money back. This book is just the product of somebody not enought professional to accept HE CAN'T WRITE A BOOK ON THE SUBJECT. Very repetitive, boring. Anyways...!!!"
2,Questionable quality from a defunct outfit,"Before purchasing this UAV CORP. videotape of THE BOUNTY, consider quality of the product itself.UAV was founded in 1984 and was based in South Carolina. Specialists in public domain TV shows and films, their tapes were dubbed at slower speeds, which means video quality suffers. There's blurriness and depending on the VCR, tracking issues.Despite being bought out by and merging with VCI in 2002, UAV went out of business four years later."
5,An Amazing Computer...,"This is far more than I expected... The fastest computer I've owned to date... Quiet too... I've owned 4 Mac's and 2 PC's... It seems to have plenty of everything, 250 gig's hard drive space, 1 gig memory, 2 optical drives and Windows Media Center Edition 2005... It does everything I need it to do and more... Very happy with my purchase."
5,Dudzele the little town in the flanders,"For the people looking for a lot of specific information about the historical background of Dudzele, try this booklet. It gives you a historical trip through time, from the time that Dudzele lived from the harbour industry during Mid-Ages, until now when it still is a beautifull historical village, with his old bombastic church, narrow streets, etc. All very well explained together with the necessary postcards, with are a gift for the eye."
3,Not a plush - more electronic toy than a doll,"Bought this for my nephew intending it as one of his very first toys. It's marked 5+ years (not shown in amazon listing) and has a hard plastic electronic insert in the back that is sealed in with velcro.If you flap it's left arm, it makes farting noises, like if you stick one hand under your armpit and flapped... It actually plays the tune of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"", all in fart noises.If you put his right hand over his nose he says things like ""oh, wow, turkey surprise!"" ""Urrrp, Lemony fresh!"" or gargles or makes the Taz spinning sounds from the Looney Tunes cartoons.Entertaining for about 5 minutes for an adult that finds the potty humor enjoyable, but not what I had bought it for."
1,nonsense.,"this book is nonsense. it seemed to me that the woman who wrote it is very conservative, privileged, anti-feminist. she also goes out of her way at the end of the book to talk about how she left her abuser to go be with his best friend. why that is relevant, i have no idea. bleh.anyway, waste of time and money."
4,Liked it until I saw the TV mini-series,This is a good movie but the TV mini-series is far superior. This version ends at less than half the story of the book. I didn't care for the lead female actress in this. She was a ditzy blonde and I felt this takes away from the story. Johanne Whaley is much better in the mini-series.
3,Pretty small watch,"It is a nice watch, very feminine and it comes in a gorgeous box. However, I found the watch smaller than I expected."
3,Segment on Greatest Athletes of the Century,"This was a lame discussion of the best athletes of the century. They are indicated decade by decade. As for the best athlete of the whole century Schaap selects the football player Jim Brown, on the grounds of Brown's all- around ability in many different sports almost all of which he did not play professionally.Halberstamm selects Celtic center Bill Russell. Among the athletes mentioned as candidates for the greatest of the century are Babe Ruth, Michael Jordan, Jack Johnson, Jim Thorpe. What surprised me is how dull the whole discussion was."
2,"A good book on native culture, not so much on drumming","I was hoping for an instructional book on the actual technique of drumming. This book is more an overview of the historical and cultural aspects. It does a good job of that, but if you're looking for drumming instruction, this is not it."
1,Unhappy,I specifically ordered from this seller because I wanted the CD with the book--the book itself is wonderful. The CD was broken when the book arrived. Very disappointing.
4,Global Village Club,"Welcome to the Global Village Club. Here in this room, we have Afrodesia: The Tribal Sound of Irma. This compilation is on the tribal house tip, providing some really strong tracks to dance to or to zone out to. All the tracks are percussion heavy, with afro-caribbean beats throughout the CD. Check out Jestofunk's track or Shazz and my favorite, Sam Paglia! Do not be mislead, this isn't your run of the mill type of compilation. Most of the tracks are either great or good. This isn't your filler compilation.Irma is a label that definitely is worth keeping an eye on."
2,Not For Beginners,"I have just started in archery and this book did not answer my questions about the sport of archery. I wanted a book to tell me about target shooting, but this book is aimed at experienced hunters.So, if you are an experienced hunter looking for a way to get around target panic this might be for you; however, if you want to shoot at a stationary target buy something else. Much of the book deals with shooting in a traditional fashion, such as not using sights (line up along the arrow and cant the bow) and how to let the string roll off your fingers.I shoot with sights and I use a mechanical release (this is a string holding device and lets you release the arrow after pulling a small trigger). The book just doesn't deal with this type of shooting."
3,"Good intro to instinctive shooting but too much physcho-babble about ""target panic.""","The first part of this book offers good, straightforward advice for the developing instinctive archer. However, in the later sections of the book the author gets into a lot of physcho-babble about target panic that I did not find useful."
5,Excellent book,"This was an easy book to read, and it had lots of usefull information. I thought it was too simple at first. I applied the lessons and my shooting started to improve steadily. It has been just over a month since I read the book, and I have ""Robin-hooded"" two arrows with my recurve bow without sights."
1,Wasted my money on this Verbose Philosophy,"I can't imagine what book the reviewers that heaped praise on this book read.The author should stick to the shrink business.Lots of pages of philosophy with a smidgin of basic how do you launchan arrow hints.Little of use to a beginner needing specifics on the mechanics of bows,arrows, and accessories.Interesting philosophy-useless and vague information on archery.Amazon has excellent books, in particular ""Shooting the Stickbow"" by Anthony Camera,an expertly written and complete text for beginners through more advancedarchery students.Give ""Insights"" a pass.Invest in Camera's book and learn about archery."
4,Accelerate learning any repetitive tasks,"I found this book on my shelf at home. I am not planning on taking up archery. But the subtitle about ""accelerated learning through applied psychology"" sounded like it might yet be relevant for other activities, so I read the book. You can get some good insights if you read it with software development in mind. Ask yourself which are the essential but repetitive activities that need to be carried out consistently, and learn what it takes to ensure that they get done right every time. Do that so you have time to focus on the much higher-level software tasks like design and coding. No, no explicit software hints in the book. But the psychological principles still apply. So if you read the book, let me know if it helped either your software or your archery."
1,From Back Cover,"To Have and to Hold... Stacey Richards had finally come home to her Texas ranch, and she was damned if anyone was going to run her off again. Eleven years of exile in Paris had transformed her from wildcat to woman - a woman who'd still fight like a tiger for her birthright. She wanted her land... with no strings attached.She refused to comply with the terms of her grandfather's will. Refused to marry Ben Oakes in order to receive her legacy. Somehow, she vowed, she'd override the absurd codicil... and her own irrational reaction to Ben. Once she would have given everything for the rugged cowboy. He'd spurned her then - now it was her turn..."
4,A beautiful book,"I loved the artwork and the stories about the celtic myths. I was a little disappointed that there was so little information about the gods like Cernunnos, Epona, and others. But the book gave a very good explanation to why and I admire Anne Ross' as an author."
4,Celtic Mythology 101,"This volume is a fine introduction to Celtic mythology, featuring fourteen chapters of stories. Most pages are illustrated with black and white illustrations by John Sibbit, paired with occasional two-page full color spreads by Roger Garland. The double-column small type lends a textbook feel, as the book races through legend after legend, each tale punctuated by headers. The vibrant color pictures depict scenes of beauty and terror such as the great battle of the giants of Morvah, Cath Palug the monster cat, Fionn's salmon of knowledge and the Lady of the Lake from Arthurian tales. The short pronunciation guide in the back of the book is a boon for readers unfamiliar with the unconventional appearance of Irish and Welsh spelling. This book would be appropriate for middle-schoolers and up."
3,I've finished the prologue... now what?,"Ross's ""Druids, Gods and Heroes from Celtic Mythology"" was the first book about the Celts I ever got my hands on, and it is one I keep going back to -however, in continous Celtic study, it is getting less and less value. As a first book, it is great. Ross offers a simple glance at the Celtic world, along with a few of its gods, but it is very shallow. The stories, which are beautifully illustrated, are in short versions, leaving out much of the detail (which in itself slightly kills the Celtic spirit). As a prologue for continued study, it works just nicely, but I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who's read a couple of books on Celtic mythology. As a camp-fire, story telling or general interest book, though, it is wonderful."
4,Latin for Americans: First Book,"Looks like a fine book, for a textbook. Interesting enough first few lessons, lots of history with this language."
3,An illusion,"I'm giving this story a 3 star award simply for the few good bits.I feel rather cheated by Mr.Goddard as he built several plots up to such a pitch that I was eagerly awaiting the denouement..which didn't happen! The story is set in a very modernistic, circular house built early in the 20th century in which the various inhabitants, over the years, have become prone to insane fits of jealousy, scary dreams of the future and irrational behaviour.The original owner of the house and his immediate descendants are somehow linked to the Russian diplomatic service and are labelled as traitors to England. Add to this a good mix of murders, strange and unexplained deaths and, in the last pages when the reader is waiting for all to be revealed...nothing!! I still don't know what happened!!"
3,Not His Best,"Goddard is a great writer of suspense, but this one becomes tedious because of the mid-life crisis theme of the storyline. Even though there is tension and the plot moves quickly, one eventually gets bogged down by the main character's emotional state."
4,A tale of suspicion and treachery,"Tony Sheridan is suffering from the recent death of his wife Marina who fell for no apparent reason from Henna Cliff in Devon. After this tragic even, Tony decides to leave Stanacombe and to live with Marina's sister Lucy and her husband Matt Prior. They possess a grandiose and remote mansion called Otherways which was the only house built by a strange Edwardian architect.Soon Tony, still plagued by the memories of Marina, is strongly attracted to Lucy and at the same time discovers a letter which states that Otherways was the setting of the mysterious murder committed in 1939 known as ""the Milner enigma"".Lucy and Tony become lovers, Tony thus betraying his friend Matt and Lucy wrecking her marriage. And as Tony tries to uncover the mystery behind Otherways, the list of victims grows longer and longer and disaster can no longer be avoided.The plot in ""Set In Stone"" turns and twists and Robert Goddard is truly a master story writer in the suspense genre."
3,holidelay,"The book arrived in great condition, but it took about two weeks to receive it after ordering online. This was a few weeks before X-mas, so Im not sure how much at fault the seller was for the delay."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"Although there were portions of this book that were good, many of them seemed uninteresting to me. I had hoped it would be a story that provided interesting details of both a bike journey and book collecting. In the end I feel like a got less than I hoped for either. He seems to gloss over many of his actual riding journey but spends a lot of time on details that added nothing to the story for me. Perhaps I am spoiled by Peter Egan."
1,Don't waste your time,"This was one of the silliest books I've read in a long time, maybe it'd just not my style. At least it was free on Kindle!"
3,All over the place,"I got this book for free on my Kindle awhile back, I started reading it and it seemed like one of those ""ugh"" freebies. In the meantime I read ""The Madness of Lord Ian Mackenzie"" and I thought it was pretty good so I decided to give this one a chance. Now, I did read it all the way through and it was entertaining, but It was also kind of confusing. The main characters changed their personalities back and forth, there was some magic, there was a prophecy, first it was a romance and then it was erotica. The secondary characters (except for Alexander) weren't fleshed out and acted and reacted out of tune with what was going on. I didn't hate it but I won't read it again and won't recommend it either."
4,Good story with just a few too many love scenes..,"...If they could even be called ""love"" scenes.Another reviewer pointed out, reminding me, that the magic was to be blamed for the oversexed couple jumping in between the sheets. This is a valid excuse until the spell wears off and they still have 2-3 more scenes. I do not mind detailed scenes but it just got unbelievable at one point.Oddly enough, I did not find the magical aspects of the story to be unbelieavable, although if it had been a little more prominent from the beginning that would have been nice.Overall, I enjoyed the book. The subtitle says this is #1 in a series and I look forward to reading more from it, even if I occassionally have to skip pages. I especially would like to see what happens to Meaghan."
2,"Fairy tale, fantasy,medieval????","At any given time I had no idea what I was reading. If you just want an ever changing story with steam, you may like it."
5,princelicious,A playboy prince becomes in charge of his country only to have to go find his princess and bring a prophecy to life. I liked this book and couldnt put it down.
4,"Good, exciting read",I will be reading more from this author after P&PC! I loved the way the book flowed and enjoyed the play between the characters. I don't usually go for fantasy or historical romances but the story was told so well that it didn't bother me!
4,Great book,"This was a great book and I enjoyed reading it. Penelope and Damien's romance was exactly that, a romance, with the idea of a fairy tale thrown in. The story did slow down some, but the love scenes were hot! would recommend it to anyone who loves historical romances."
4,"Effective, easy, and inexpensive","After my cat had minor surgery on his face, the vet provided this collar. My cat managed to get out of it several times, but he can get out of almost anything, so I can't say that's typical. It wasn't too difficult to get back on, and I had to do it more than once on an unhappy cat. Only took a minute or two. It's plastic so it's easy to clean and it's flexible enough to allow him to rest with it on. He can lie on his side easily. It's also sturdy enough to stand up to vigorous scratching. A good, low-cost choice when your pet needs a recovery collar."
4,A perfectly nice blend of british indie and funk.,"This album blends funky guitar with run of the mill Oasis like brit-pop, to deliver somthing refreshingly new to a stale genre. The lead singers voice is good and he delivers the lyrics well. Unfortunatly, these lyrics are at times stupid and bizzare, and the songs tend to last sometime. If, however you can overlook these flaws then its well worth buying."
5,Greenwichtown,"A wild, wild tale of a young girl living in Greenwichtown and has to endure voilence and ugliness on a daily basis until later on in the book were she leaves the country to look for work and try to support her family. And boy were they really poor. A lot of scenes are graphic and would have you in therepy if you had to witness the scenes the way Fay Myrtle had to. It was a nicely written novel but life in Greenwichtown I would wish on my worst enemy."
5,...Greenwichtown!,"I was hooked from the very first page. Joyce Palmer describes life in the Jamaican country and in Greenwichtown with such vivid detail that I was transported vicariously to the world of Fay Myrtle. This book is not only touching in its frank description of life in a Jamaican ghetto; it also educates the reader on the effects of Jamaican politics and the caste system. The book is an easy read and used enough patois to be authentic without overwhelming readers who are not familiar with this language. Although there are numerous sad, dark, and shocking moments, hope prevails in the midst of hopelessness and the book will leave you smiling or crying, but definitely satisfied."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"I couldn't put this book down once I started it, which has been a rarity for me lately!!Most of us think of Jamaica as just sunshine and beaches. Greenwichtown shows us what life is like for the children growing up in poverty on the island. It isn't all pretty but it is fascinating for those of us that have never had to experience this type of poverty. The book was well written and is heartwrenching. Definitely an eye-opener!!!"
3,nice book but not what I was looking for,"A nice book but had I seen it on the rack, I would have put it back. All the patterns are for huge looms...over 12 harnesses. Beautiful pictures...a nice study...but still a disappointment. It would be nice if Amazon had someone who understood weaving, give a more detailed and studied description!"
5,Better than Magnum,"As a huge fan of Magnum (I have about 15 Magnum CDs) I approached this with trepidation. How could Bob survive without Tony Clarkin? The answer - easily! This album is fantastic - Gary Hughes' songwriting more than equals Tony's.Fans of Magnum (particularly Storyteller's Night) should not pass this album by!Highlights would have to be the final track ""Where the heart is"", and the song about Dracula ""Shelter from the night""."
1,Go back to Sweden,"Lars needs to forget Napster, and sue these god-awful bands that keep ruining Metallica's music. Not just this album, but all of these so-called Metallica ""tribute"" albums. They all suck. If these bands want to pay tribute, they should quit and become shoe salesman."
1,Tribute?! Where?!,"Almost every band on this so called ""tribute"" album ruins the song they're playing the only really good cover is the Blackened played by Fantasmagoria but for one song this album isn't worth the money!"
1,do not buy,The bracket kit does not hold anything securely. If you weight more than 150 pounds do not stand on running boards installed using these brackets or you will be on your bottom next to your truck.
3,Tough Read,"This book is a tough read, but has some very valuable information. The front side of the book is laborious to read and doesn't share a lot of new insights into presenting. But, if you can get through the core of the book, the backside has some hidden gems. Maybe a second time through would bring the front of the book more into perspective. Overall, as American Idol Randy Jackson says, ""It was just alright."""
1,Blows,"This CD blows. Never buy it. Only dipsh*ts and deaf people listen to this music, and I don't see any hearing aids around here."
4,"This, is , a, good, album","(4.5 stars) The key to fetus's works is pure raw energy. pure mayhem is the only way to describe this album, but yet its great to listen too. Not for mainstream metal kids, but great for hardcore metalheads, good metal \m/"
5,Dear God!,"Well, after three years, Dying Fetus is back and more brutal than ever. With their last album, ""Destroy the Opposition"", DF wrote some of their most inspired music to date. And with the classic ""Killing On Adreneline"", Dying Fetus really polished their sound. But with ""Stop at Nothing"", its a whole other story. Dying Fetus have 4 new memebers (with only the orginal guitarist, John Gallagher, from the first incarnation of Dying Fetus staying behind). To top it off, the record is actually good. But it's not just good. It's great. With crushing track like ""One Shot, One Kill"", ""Institutions of Deceit"", and ""Vengence Unleashed"", Dying Fetus fans of any type will be more than pleased with at least one song on the album if not all of them. It's pretty damn hard not to like a Dying Fetus album. They always stay full of talent and always put out crushing, non-sellout, metal. What more do you need?"
5,Deathgrind at its purest...,"Realy, what you get here is nothing short of an amazing sound by dyingfetus and with a new line-up and some new sort of sound? They still manage to keep the brutality the same. Go out and buy dying fetus's "" stop at nothing"" and dont listing to the idiots, who have no idea what they're talking about. Highly recommended. \m/ !!!"
5,Happy Family,"We received this gift for Christmas this year. We have three boys, 4,5 and 6 so I thought this game might be too old for them. Boy was I wrong! The kids absolutely love this game!The 5 and 7 year old are playing regularly and learning the rules of chess quickly. The 4 year old just wants to play with the pieces-which are extremely cool and a whole lot of fun. Tired of the computer and video games? Buy this and watch your family come alive!"
2,very expensive for short life,I installed the filter and noticed after several days it was already turning brown and prevented the smoke to go through...I gave up after 3 filters in 1 month and went to the ionize type cleaner
2,FILTR F/HAP-70HOLMES PK2,"I cannot really comment on this item. It has not and will not be used. It was not for my use but for my adult children, who feel it is nothing more than a gimmick and said I should have not spent the money on it I did."
3,"Nice Idea, Poor Construction","My sons (ages 2 and 3) received this tent as a Christmas gift. They love using it as their ""hide-out"" from bad guys. However, the rods that are used to construct the arches are made of wood. Within the first week, one of the rods broke and splintered while the boys were playing. We tried fixing the broken rod with duct tape, but now the rod won't bend very easily and the tent doesn't stay in place as it should. I wish the arches were made from more flexible materials (a' la the pop-up tunnels and tents) so they could withstand normal play."
1,Dont buy,I purchased this for my sons birthday this year. He is three. He was so excited to have the play tent but when I took it out of the box and started to put it together I noticed the stitching was not straight and missing in some places. It took him no more than 24 hours to brake it. The plastic supports and cheap fabric were horrible. There was also a center support pole with no place to put it. He likes it but the quality craftmanship was a ZERO.
3,It's ok,"It seems to be ok. I was a little disappointed when it came from Amazon. All they did was slap a label on it, when I got home, needless to say, it was supposed to be Christmas gift, my son saw the box by the door. Never made it under the tree this year. Other than that, my son has had some fun with it. We drapped another sheet over it, to make a better covering."
1,pedestrian propaganda,"Although all avenues of historical research should be investigated (where reasonable leads exist), this is truely an endeavor in historical revisionism, hence unmatched except by the late Soviet scholasticship of claiming every invention from flight to democracy."
1,Poorly researched,"We reviewed this book in my African Studies course. The professor (African-American by the way) stated that most in academia consider this work laughable. The problem is that the PC environment today allows this propaganda to get through unchallenged.Read with an open mind, and then laugh at the end."
4,Mulan Doll,A pretty doll. Smaller than barbie sized dolls by a bit. Still fits barbie clothes. Comes with Asian princess dress. Soft easy to brush hair.
2,Gates of Prayer: The New Union Prayerbook,"This prayer book is not the prayer book I expected. I was surprised when it came since it was a small green book with only a hundred or so pages, not the larger dark blue prayer book used in all the Reform temples I have attended. Very disappointing..."
4,A great map... until we left downtown,"This map is helpful when it comes to weeding out the attractions, restaurants, hotels and stores. It makes good suggestions for dining, but there have been additions to some places (such as starbucks) that are not listed on the map. Looks like it should be updated. The map is NOT helpful when leaving downtown Charleston. We actually got lost using this map to find the plantations north of the city. The best approach is to use this map for downtown only, and make sure you visit the Charleston visitors center for more background information and pamphlets."
3,Not needed,I bought this before a trip and found I could get free maps easily once I got there. The map is fine and I kept it for a souvenir but I didn't really need to buy it.
2,Okay,Too broad and generalized. Not enough detail and descriptions regarding pathophysiology on a cellular level. Good diagrams and the price is right.
3,fine isn't that fine,"I purchased this pen with a fine nib. The writing line was not as fine as I had anticipated. Pelikan, through Chartpak, swapped the nib for a extra fine nib and that is much more acceptable. It would be nice to find a sample of the widths of the various nib widths.Shipment was prompt."
4,"""Utopia"" is Proof the Real Writers Are Out There","The internet age has opened so many doors in so many different fields, it's heartening to see how it can help a first-author get her work out. And what a work it is! For those who are attached to the Fantasy genre, it's for you. But it also has great appeal for lovers of Romance, Science Fiction and Reportage. Since this is marketed as Barbara Bovard's first novel, one must wonder: Where are the mainstream publishing houses, or better yet, where WERE they, when she was knocking on traditional doors? No matter, because they missed the boat by not signing her. All the better for readers. In addition to seasoned fans of futuristic tales, this will also have strong appeal for those new to the genre, or readers venturing away from their favorites for awhile. Congrats Ms. Bovard! And we hope to see more."
1,Terrible Movie,"Horrible script and acting - don't waste your money or time. Kevin Hart was in the movie for about 1 minute and delivered the only good scene. The two supporting actors were good, but the movie was awful."
1,Kevin Hart appears for approximately 60 seconds,"I rented this movie when I saw that Kevin Hart was in it...I thought it was going to be super funny. The movie wasn't funny, and Kevin Hart is in this movie for approximately 60 seconds...only a small portion of a small scene. THe only funny thing about this movie is the crazy girlfriend will all the pink in the apartment and the meltdown she has while (spoiler alert) her boyfriend tries (unsuccessfully) to break up with her. This is not a good movie."
2,Good reason for all the bad reviews..... BUT I LIKED IT!!!,OK......these actors are C grade actors... like the ones you see in soap operas and old navy commercials. Well they certainly looked the part. Some comical WTF moments. Like the 60 second cameo KEVIN HART part where he advised the guy to take a $#it in the bacon to end the relationship. But unfortunately since the acting is subpar..it leaves you wondering...what if meagan good played the skinny chicks role?(for some silly reason I would like to see more of that cute skinny chick in the future...hope she takes acting lessons!) What if Kevin was in the movie for 20 minutes? Then it wouldve been a great movie. These guys should stick to secondary roles such as (screaming lady #1) or (guy behind counter in Mcdonalds commercial.) Or remain a key grip. Or Maybe be the assistant to the assistant director! Leave the big on screen stuff to the REAL PROFESIONALS. It deserves one star...I wanna give it THREE but in all fairness I'll give it two.
1,AWFUL,"This movie was truly awful. Don't waste your MONEY! I would of rated it a 0 but 0 wasn't an option. Kevin Hart makes a cameo appearance, which is approximately 1 minute. The story line and the acting were very poor."
1,Terrible movie.,"We tried to like this one and kept watching it, but it never really came to life. We didn't think it was funny and it seemed to just drone on. Could not watch to the end. Don't waste the rental fee."
5,"Bush, the Leader","Anyone that knows what he/she's looking at knows the kind of man President Bush is. And that is sincere and honest. Thanks to Mr. Podhoretz, we know this to be even more true."
1,The hardest part about reading this book...,was the all-too-frequent visions of Midge Decter having sex.
1,More lies about the Bush administration,"Facts are twisted and taken out of context, and some of the stuff in this book is downright false. President Bush is the most frightening president in my life time. His policies and actions are not for the good of our country. Just thinking about him makes me sick to my stomach."
1,Something of the REAL truth?,"To Gomer in Homerville, and others . . . there are a lot of people propping up the president and digging dirt and playing nasty with so-called ""liberals"" (anyone who doesn't get on their knees to GWBush and his gang of fascists). This author is just another Bush slappy, the book written for you 'Gomers' of the world. Why not ""open your eyes"" and read what a former Bush conservative insider and hatchetman confesses! Read David Brock's - Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative. For starters."
3,Amazon - Please Review the Reviews,Can't anyone see that all the negative reviews here were written by the same person who no doubt did not even read the book? I like to come to Amazon to read real man-on-the-street critiques from people who have actually read or listened to the subject in question - not political rhetoric that should be done on blogs. Sorry for the short diatribe.
1,How Bush Became the WORST LEADER EVER!!!!,"Between sending our country to war over false pretenses (ie; Bush's personal greed), terrible response to Hurricane Katrina, this whole anti-gay thing, and the failure that was No Child Left Behind, I'd have to say that Bush is not a very good leader. That and the guy can't seem to acknowledgeBTW, I myself am not gay but see nothing wrong with it. If you can see it in no other way, the gays might strike back, the way the blacks reacted to whites (and believe me, they had a good reason to) when they were being treated like crap in the '60's. So unless you want riots through your city, you'll at least try to be tolerant. This goes out to all you anti-gay people. And remember; Don't hate people without logical reason! (See, I have good reasons to hate Bush!)"
1,"response to a reader from Powder Springs, Georgia","I love the way that Bushies always telegraph what they're doing by accusing their opponents of it. ""If you can't answer your opponent's arguments denigrate the man."" There's Bush's election (""re-election"" is a misnomer) strategy in a nutshell - in fact, it constitutes almost his entire political armament. Viz. the slime crusade against Richard Clarke, Paul O'Neill, John Kerry, and anybody else who stands in the way of this illegitmate, unelected, unprincipled, ignorant, irresponsible, arrogant, authoritarian, hypocritical, callous, murderous administration."
1,he became a ... what?,"a great what? er, last time I checked he was still an imbecile... I must have missed something that the five star reviewers did not :)"
1,Response to Hawaii,"Actually, the negative reviews of this truly predictable piece of propaganda all come from a variety of reviewers, nearly all of whom have signed their names, wanting to attest and document their contempt for this worthless attempt at spin doctoring...Do you right wingers even look at the evidence? Or do you just make it up as you go along, assuming you're bound to fool somebody?"
3,"Long Winded, but Right!","As an American as I was raised to love my country and always respect my President. I mean, by the simple virtue that the MAJORITY of Americans elected the man to office means he must be the better choice. I was very glad to see someone finally taking a stand against Michael Moore and all his friends and setting the record straight. Unfortunately, I found it too wordy for my personal tastes. I don't like to read a book and the dictionary at the same time! However, the points that really came across were the right ones and I would strongly advise bringing a copy of this with you too dinner parties where some of your ""blue state"" neighbors or relatives might be in attendence. Hopefully this book will inspire someone else to write a similar but easier to read version."
2,If John Podhoretz had his way,"...there'd be framed portraits of Trotsky and Bush in every classroom. According to the electoral map, the political vision of his father, Norman, and Irving Kristol has at last been realized. ""Red states,"" indeed!"
1,what!,"I would rather have a dead rat as president, then bush.He is a idiot. How can you people back him up. He is nuts and he is messing up our country! you should all be ashamed of yourselves."
1,Day is night,"Day is night and night is day, and George W. Bush is the greatest president since Andrew Jackson.Laden with misstatements of fact and facts re-arranged to suit the conclusion, this is a bit of ""journalism' worthy of Jayson Blair.Or of the Bush national security team ... Read it at the library. Don't waste your dollars on this flagrant mouthpiece."
3,more bagels!,"The Podhoretz family is known for its delicious recipes for bagels and cream cheese. Now John -- a founding member of the Log Cabin Republicans -- has come out with a decidedly partisan, but oft-delicious serving of lox and lies to go with the family business.Terrific."
1,One Daddy's boy on another Daddy's boy,"If you can get past Podhoretz's assertion that George W. Bush is a ""great"" president, here's another goodie for you. The Pod calls GWB ""the best presidential speaker since Franklin Delano Roosevelt."" Uh-hunh, right. It takes a real classy background to call Vladimir Putin ""Pootie-Poot.""This collection of preposterously wishful thinking (George W. Bush has, says Podhoretz, ""remarkable self-discipline in his personal life"") is for right-wing diehards only, who aren't about to let the truth get in the way of what they consider a good story."
1,Liberals sane but highly motivated,"Podhoretz has it wrong. Bush did not drive liberals insane. Rather he has energized, motivated, and united them in a driving determination to remove him from power this November before he does even more harm to the country. It turns out that when Bush said ""I'm a uniter"" he was right. He has united the liberals in their determiniation to drive him from power this Fall."
1,For Hardcore Republicans Only,"If you are looking to find a well researched objective view on Bush and the accomplishments of his presidency you will not find it in this book.It smacks of propaganda that one would have seen coming out fascists Germany or Communist Russia, although not as nearly well written."
1,Bush and the Bushing Bushers who tell them...,"Wow. The depths the Bushies will go to try and defend this guy. I mean, how can they say he's a great president with a straigt face?! Well, we all know the truth. The Great Divider will always be remembered for what he is - a cold-hearted, callous, treacherous thug...and the worst president of modern times. Check out this website which should be up and running on July 1, 2004 www.MisunderestimatingBush.com Good day Amazonians and God Bless America!"
1,Living in a fantasy world,"Mr. Podhoretz is a master at not telling the truth. In fact he is so good at publishing untruths he should join the Bush cabinet. Just by his claim that Bush is the best Presidential speaker he shows us that he has NEVER heard ANY other President speak. This book is just another heavily biased piece of propaganda filled with the delusions of a man who either has no idea of the kind of man Bush really is, or knows and wants to make sure we don't. Just another example of how our Grand Old Party has been taken over by extremists."
1,Total crap,The rantings of a neoconservative apologist for President Bush. Total crap...skip it and try to find more objective research on the Bush presidency.
1,Geez...,"Apparently only people to the right of Attila the Hun are reviewing this forgettable $6 paperback.Do you guys feel real good patting each other on the back and playing ""good ole boys""?Liberals should read ""Bush Country"", actually. It won't restore your faith in mankind, but it'll most definitely reaffirm your political views. No visions, no real pride, just a lot of pathetic nationalism, chest-beating and cheap jokes. Is berating the opposition all that the GOP has to offer? That's just sad.And the fact that the govenment is in the hand of these kinds of people is even worse...I recently went to Europe for a few weeks, and I hate to see how America's reputation is suffering all over the world. The election of George W. Bush makes people in the western world question the intelligence of all Americans, not just those who voted for him. And who can blame them?"
3,Not good for searching,"These gloves are good only if you know that there are needles, or other sharp things on someone, or in a house, car, etc. The problem with these gloves is that because of the armor tips, you can't feel objects when you are searching a person, car, or house. If you are a regular patrol officer, I would look for another pair of needle resistant gloves. These will protect you from needle sticks, but will make it very difficult for you to find other contraband."
4,Nice watch,I like this watch's design.The only issue I found is the low light feature when you want to see the time at night.Not bright enough for me.But definetly a good watch.Oliver
1,New Guitar Summit: Live at the Stoneham Theatre,I was disappointed in the quality of this performance. These guys sounded more like amateurs than professionals.
4,Slide Sandal,"The slide has a nice look and the footbed is a lot softer than some other brands in the same style. Sizing seems to run a little small (1/4""-1/2""). The band is set far up on the foot and when first walking in them it would hit my toes;however, the band feels fine after working them in. The material also seems to be quite durable. Overall a great slide for the low price."
5,[Note regarding interrupted review],[I was just reviewing this book and had nearly finished when I was taken off line by a phone call. How can I retrieve my vanished draft-review? My email address is ElianaRefaya@aol.com. Many thanks for any help you can provide.]
4,Walmart sells this one for $99,Also the loose connection is actually is a bad plug connector wire which you can order from Walmarts help line for $5 bucks. Fixed mine!
2,A little too much....,"I feel that these Spike tablets might work for some people, but for me they just made me feel like crap! The energy I got from just one was not the type of energy I wanted. It was like WAY too much at one time which made me feel VERY jittery. To top it off the headaches I got from this stuff were the worst!! I don't recommend this product to anyone unless you already know what this stuff is about."
1,freerunner review,"I am a big fan of good movies, and I also love parkour. I took me a great amount of patience to watch this movie to the end. I would not watch this again if would get paid to do so."
2,This is not a book that HS students should have to read.,The reason that I say high school students should not be required to read this is becuase of the profanity the cheating and the lying which the book is based on. This was a very trying time in are history but are kids should not have to be subject to reading this kind of material. Is there not another way of teaching this?
3,Not all it's supposed to be,"Bought the sugar bowl and creamer. They had been billed as coming from Europe but were not. The color of the two items did not match. If you don't care about where it's made and don't care about the colors being right-on, they're pleasant-enough appearing and a nice size for the table."
2,"So,..so,..average or less.","I've taken blue-green algae in the past so am very familiar with the benefits.After taking this algae I experienced nothing.I even tried crushing the pressed tablets and diluting them with 6 oz water.Took two grams per day, and after ten days decided to return the product.A better solution for algae is SUN Chlorella, specifically SUN brand, not hyped imitations.When taking supplements, (whole foods are of course the best),...quality and quantity are paramount.Most people spend far too much, consuming far too many, in non specific combinations, that no benefitsare ever experienced other than 'the placebo effect'."
1,Book was in tatters... very bad conditions,This book when it was delivered to me was in pathetic conditions. Binding was poor and all the pages were coming out. I don't think this book would have survived the entire read. It was good only for decorating the library.
3,Too Short,"I know the picture shows the short above the knees. It is my fault. I am so short, I thought it would fall further down-wrong. I will wait until fall/winter and wear with tights. The ruffles don't really look right either."
3,missing critical feature,"this printer is missing a basic and useful feature that all other printers have. Basically if I put paper in the manual feed then the printer should automatically gets paper from the manual feed instead. But this printer you have to remember to choose the manual feed tray from the computer setting otherwise it will always get paper from from tray 2 (the standard tray). Even worse, the printer has the option of ""tray auto switching"" and you would think it means switching between manual tray and tray2. but no, it's actually switching between tray 2 and tray 3 if you have tray 3. The default printer only comes with manual feed and tray2. And this is not documented and 3 of xerox tech support did not know it either until the 4th one told me it. It took me 3 extra hours on the phone to figure this out. I will buy HP next time. How hard is to put some basic and common feature in a printer."
4,Great Product,"I received my product 1 day earlier than estimated. The product was packaged ""new"" as indicated on the Amazon website. I have had the product for 6 weeks now with no problems. The installation was very easy. I would like to add that the cartridges are very expensive, but you can get them at [..] a little cheaper than most sites."
4,My Collection is Complete,"WOW!Nothing to say, is just a good start and a great end in the CD.Just Awesome, I really like it.Is a little dificult to get it but is really great.Go for it.A really Paul's fan"
2,A little thin and pasty,"I've tried a number of different kinds of Australian licorice and for me these really came up short. The licorice taste is rather thin and weak, and the texture is very pasty. There is a nice lingering aftertaste, but this was about the only positive.It is possible that there is a lot a variability among batches, but I tried several bags and each was similar"
3,10 oz bags,"I enjoyed the Kookaburra black licorice, but shop around because the bags from the Candy Depot are only 10 ounces. Other online retailers are selling 16 oz bags, and there's not a lot of difference in price. Also, make sure the retailer isn't trying to make up the difference by gouging you on shipping cost. Next time I'll be more careful."
5,strong flavor,"A co-worker offered me a piece a few months ago and I went WOW, I have had many licorice products before but this was something else. very strong and great flavor, I just wish it did not have so many calories. The good thing is that you only need a couple pieces to carry you for a while"
3,I've had better,"It is very difficult to find really good black licorice. This is good tasting black licorice, but for me, this isn't the best licorice in the world.Mostly, I didn't care for the texture: chunks of sticky, not very chewy, solid rope. I was hoping for a texture similar to Red Vines: hollow sticks with a bit of chew-challenge.Once upon a time, my local candy store would get very very fresh licorice sticks in weekly. I am trying to recapture that pleasure, and this wasn't it."
2,Not as advertised (with Sample?????),"(Kookaburra Black Licorice 4 Bags with Sample), is how the item was described. The above described was pruchased as a gift, neither the recipient or me the purchaser received the Sample. I was unable figure out who to question about the omission, and the recipient even questioned me about the sample."
2,Doesn't show true measurement,"I was excited about this blanket since it would be a relaxing way to measure the baby. I was right in that regard and the blanket itself is a nice combination of fabrics and a heavy weight BUT it doesn't measure accurately. And by not accurately I mean that what the blanket measures 25"" that is actually 23"". I mean come on. They could have at least tried to make the measurements close to real."
2,"Nice glasses, but the lenses falls out","When I bought these, I did not realize that the lens were replaceable, and now having used them, would not purchase them again. They are fine if you do not play any sports, but while windsurfing I took a fall, and when I got back up on the board, one of the lenses was gone. And worse yet, I was not even moving on the board when I fell, so don't think I was screaming across the bay.The lenses have also fallen out on me when I pick them up while driving. That truly annoys me as they are not so easy to get back in, and you are not sure they are truly back in.I did buy an extra set of lenses, but once gone, these glasses will find their way to the trash barrel."
4,"Light weight, comfortable and great bargain.","They might not be the most fashionable or exciting pair of sunglasses but they get the job done while being comfortable, light weight and affordable. I'd recommend these to anyone who needs a second pair of sunglasses to toss around in the car or to use while traveling."
4,Exceeding the Expectations,"While this is obviously no Elizium, it's not bad. This is more polished than Carl McCoy's Nefilim or the ""unauthorized"" release Fallen. Although McCoy is not even in this NFD's line-up, some of the Nephilim moods carry.These songs do lean on the heavy side a bit (not as much as Zoon by Nefilim), but the harmonies are nice and not completely lost amnogst guitars, especially in Lost Souls. While there are similarities in sound between NFD and other Nephilim incarnations, there is some promise here.So, don't expect a Fields of the Nephilim release here, but it's definitely worth a try."
1,Had to return,"The item kept bowing the fuses in my brand new car under 3000 miles. I tried multiple outlets and it blew all three fuses, would not purchase. Ended up just unplugging the fridge when needed."
3,It works?,"Yes that's meant to be a question mark. I can honestly say that I never had to jump start my car when using this and my electric Coleman cooler, I just don't think this devise really works the way it should.From what I can tell this is more like a timer than a voltage shut off. On a couple of occasions the almost brand new car with a brand new battery had trouble starting after I had turned the car on part way to the check the mileage or outside temperature. It was almost as if I had reset the timer because the cooler would then turn back on. If there was a true drop in voltage it should have stayed off. The amount of time the device let the cooler run for didn't seem to matter on whether we drove for 10 minutes to the camp showers or if we had driven across the state.Bottom line is that since I already have it I will keep using it, but I will also keep jumper cables with me just to make sure."
4,Battery Saver,I drive a hybrid car and its battery is very valuable. This battery saver is worth its weight in gold as I do not want to lose my battery.
1,NO GOOD,Misses the adapter to connect the power cord to the cooler (when plugged to a wall outlet). The cooler works great in the car.
2,Disappointed,"I am not sure if the product is malfunctioning or cycles on/off too much. A little disappointed, but still reviewing operation of product."
4,The gift was a success!,"The Koolatron battery saver and the cooler where a huge hit as a gift. Fantastic, different kind of gift for my boss who was leaving her job and going to a more challenging one to help improve conditions at a new company. What I was not pleased with was the wrapping. I paid $5.00 for the packaged to be wrapped. The ""wrapping"" was a blue velvet bag with yellow ribbon that looked horrible! I had to go out and buy wrapping paper and wrap the gift because I would have never given my boss that gift in that horrible looking velvet bag. I won't ever ask for a gift to be wrapped again....will do myself so that it looks presentable..."
5,"Don't have to worry about unplugging the cooler, etc.","I bought this for my electric cooler.I never have to worry about not unplugging the cooler. Leave it plugged in while you stop for lunch, or if you get checked in to the motel and you forgot to unplug.When the battery voltage gets down, it will disconnect the device from the circuit. Saving your battery so you can start your car. It's nice when you stop for food and end up doing some sight seeing while you are there.Works with any device."
5,Compliments the Koolatron Perfectly!,"Great item to use in the car or truck, however a bit difficult to work out how to use at first. No worries however, if one only takes the time to read the settings on the connector, easy and works brilliantly."
5,martianbase.com,"Greeting from martianbase.com, we enjoyed your pictures of mars,come back and stay sometime , when you have more time, at our new 5 star luxury resort at martianbase@cs.com. Our new martian Hilton features in room hottubs (it does get rather cold up here!"
3,"Great book, contrived ending :(","I loved this book, it's an excellent story, without an ending. But the writer really does this all the way through the books. An excellent story line, with very few details to help you fully appreciate the story and the world in which it is set. When it comes to important, character changing events within the character's lives, she leaves out all details. It just makes it very difficult to get to know the characters, beyond the male/female conflict that unerringly crops up in every one of their conversations.The story itself though is worth the three stars, an excellent storyline. I'll read the next book, I've already purchased it. But I want to see how the story ends. I just wish Tolkien or Jordan could tell it :P"
5,Jim Thompson would be proud,"Fan of tough-guy, noir-esque fiction? Enjoy the bleak, cynical tough-guys popularized by Chandler, Thompson and Willeford? Vacchs pays homage to all of them in _The Getaway Man_.Eddie gets his start stealing cars but soon finds his true calling. Driving getaway cars for armed robbers. His reputation grows after a stoic performance during a bank heist gone bad. After release from prison, he hooks up with a solid career criminal, J.C. Naive - but completely dedicated to his craft - Eddie soon finds that his new pals come with a complicated set of questions.I believe Jim Thompson would have thoroughly enjoyed _The Getaway Man_ and I look forward to Vacch's continued efforts in a pulp fiction revival."
4,Far From A One-Tracked Story,"From a very early age Eddie only ever had one dream and that was to be a driver. This is the story of how he realised that dream and how he came to earn the respect of his peers, which was one of the few things in life he valued. It seems that it didn't matter how good or bad someone was according to Eddie, if they complimented him on his driving, then they were okay in his book.Eddie makes a very interesting character. He was a mixture of extreme naivety when it came to common emotional issues, but he had an instinctive cunning when it came to survival. It gives him a much deeper level of complexity than was first apparent and is one of the great strengths of the book.I found this to be a very quick read and is modelled off the old pulps of yesteryear, both in external appearance and in content. The writing is succinct and to the point and the story moves along at great pace before reaching a shattering conclusion."
4,Take me back,"A good old fashioned style scores big. This is a good one. Nobody's good and some are real bad. The author plays his cards close, and holds to the last page."
2,"Good talk, bad write","Mr. Coleman is considered one of the finest of baseball broadcasters, but his (and Mr. Valeni's) writing is rote - tell a lot of familiar yarns, and hope Red Sox fans will buy the book."
3,What happen with this ever wonderful?,"Since may personal point of view not the best, not bad, simply diferent, kind a movie sound track. Good for those who want all Epica CD's."
4,cute little lights,These are nice lights. The best thing is probably that the pepper part is made of flexible material so they are pretty much unbreakable. They are about 20 ft long.
3,"kids love: ""Thanks Mom""","I teach music at several day care centers. The kids LOVE the song ""Thanks Mom"" and often ask to sing it!"
2,Left Me Cold,"***SPOILER ALERT*** I felt nothing for the characters and found Simon's relationship with his cruel/kind master unfathomable. Okay....you drug me, choke me into unconsciousness, then rape me, on multiple occasions, and I say 'I love you'. Stockhom Syndrome, anyone? Jeeze, only a female author (and I'm female) could think this stuff up. Oh, and when Simon is not being ""used"" by his master, he must service the master's wife. But, of course, he falls in love with the girl, Alyx, who he impregnates and later marries.Although it is very well-written, the characters left me cold, and I wound up skimming the second half, not caring how the story ended."
5,A Great Book!,"WOW! I never read anything like it! Very unique and different. The book was quite disturbing at times. I felt so sorry for Alyx and Simon for all the pain and suffering they endured, especially Simon. I was crying throughout the book. The love they felt for each other was strong, but it was forbidden. The book was great, I loved it, except I felt like the ending was rushed. The author could of written at least another chapter or two."
2,Deathly dull,"Mediocre synth-metal continually hovers around generic, aspiring only to the less-mediocre stereotypical qualities inherent in an Evanescence or Therion."
4,This album rocks,"I was never really into After Forever. Like The Gathering and a host of other bands, they always played second fiddle in my mind to bands like Nightwish, Within Temptation, and Lacuna Coil. But I'm glad I gave their latest effort a listen. This album totally rocks. The annoying growling is minimal and Floor Jansen's vocals are absolutely beautiful. What sets it apart from the earlier stuff of thiers I've heard is that this album JAMS. That, and their other stuff always seemed incomplete somehow. Like the songs were unfulfilled ideas. No really memorable or catchy melodies. This album is different. It is headbanging AND beautiful. Highly recommended. The only reason I give a 4 instead of 5 is that it doesn't quite rise to the level of the other bands I mentioned. But, it may rise in my estimation over time. I will definitely be listening to it A LOT."
4,Continuing to Move away from Goth,"with this album After Forever continue to move away from their Gothic roots toward a more popish sound. While I think their sound peaked with ""Invisible Circles,"" ""Remagine"" takes a little step back. I didn't feel it was as hard driving as IC. Floor's voice is still going strong, and the songs are catchy but there seems to be a lack of energy on this album that is necessary to make it a 5 star album. This album is almost a lapse in the career of After Forever because the album after this is pretty solid. If you are new to After Forever I would suggest ""Invisible Circles"" or their self-titled album before this one. Not that it is a bad album, it's just not their best IMO."
5,Terrific.,"Having grown up listening to heavy metal bands from the 80's, I just can't stand most of the current gothic metal bands, they just bore me to death.But this band is different. ""Remagine"" is an excellent work from (IMO) the best Gothic Metal band, After Forever. Lead vocalist Floor Jansen is amazing, the best singer in the genre. Sorry but the other girls don't have the range much less the power to drive a metal song as well as Floor. Other girls have beautiful voices, but so does Floor, and she can sing aggressively while the others can't! The rest of guys are very good, playing with an authentic metal edge. Try to see a video showing After Forever on a live performance and you understand what I'm talking about.Even if you don't like gothic bands you'll like this CD."
2,Suprisingly not good,"The book had an interesting premise but failed to live up to it. The book was exciting for about 10-20 pages. The rest was based on teenage suicide, drugs, and sex with no real stunning writing engaging in the characters feelings and emotions. It boiled down to a story of unrealistic characters trying to find themselves."
4,Cold in Summer by Tracy Barrett,"In this book Tracy Barret has excellent writing that took me into a whole other world where I could see the characters and feel the surroundings. I deffinetly would recommend this book. At first one would think ""Oh I already know this. Why read the rest?"" I promise it gets good. It tells you May is a ghost but the suspense is thrilling and really rewarding at the end.* . * . *Ariadne just moved from Florida into a small rural town in Tennessee where everybody knows everybody. Ariadne misses what she calls ""home"". May who has lived there all her life is ""lost"" and counts on Ariadne to get her ""home"". Many people have tried to help her but can Ariadne be the one to do it? I promise you will understand EVERYTHING once you read the book!"
5,The Best Album of 2005,"I don't care if anyone thinks I'm bias for putting a musician whose name is the same as mine at number one. This guy is the real deal. Lonely People of the World, Unite! flows in a way I have rarely heard albums flow before. Every single aspect of this album, from writing to production to instrumentation, is stellar. Lead track ""Iron Woman"" begins at breakneck speed, with a sense of immediacy rarely heard on an indie rock album. And Davis' driving force never slows down as the album races through ten more songs, each one just as good as the last. His voice may not be as good as those of his contemporaries, but he delivers each vocal track with a wail and a yelp, as if he's betting all he's got on these eleven tracks (which he probably has)."
2,Devin Davis - The Kiss Revolution,"""I am crap rock."" I got excited after reading a review of this, but what a disappointment. When will people figure out that rehashing 70s riffs doesn't necessarily make good music. The acoustic stuff really is betrayed by the ""bigger sound"" songs. Someone has been listening to Bowie. ;)"
1,Out of Date Book Still Being Sold,"This book was billed as the ""paper back edition."" This book is the 6th edition and the text is now in its 8th edition. There actually IS an 8th edition in paperback."
5,Excellent tea pot.,"This is an excellent tea pot. I like the large size and the fine mesh infuser. I also have a red one and love that they stack easily, which makes storage much easier."
5,Stump Teapot,They're great little teapots for 1-2 cups -- my wife loves them. The earlier ones had a mesh tea-leaf holder which was easier to clean than the current stainless steel perforated pot
5,Perfect tea pot!,I am really happy with this tea pot. It's solid and stylish and serves me up the two cups I want whenever I drink loose leaf tea. The tea strainers is very fine and holds the tea leaves well. The infuser washes very easily. I'm really pleased with it and recommend it.
3,Mesh tea holder rusts,"I love the tea pot and design, but the mesh holder that holds the tea is rusty after one month of use. Not sure if that is common, but I wouldn't buy this product again."
4,not bad.,"ordered this for a gift, mostly. ordered four bags. ate one and sent the other three as a gift. this candy is very tasty and good sized pieces. does stick to your teeth a bit, but overall i would give it a thumbs up."
4,For the European living in USA,I am Scandinavian and like most of us I love licorice. This is the only decent licorice that I have found in the United States. Well worth the money.
2,FORZIERI IS UNPROFESSIONAL!,"I tried ordering a wallet from this company through Amazon, and they didn't send it! It was supposed to arrive by the 24th of Dec. for Christmas. When the date was approaching and I couldn't find any shipping information, I emailed them. I had to e-mail twice to get a response.They apologized that they didn't make the deadline. And they offered to include a ""put-the-blame-on-us card."" I cannot understand how this would make my gift arrive on time for Christmas--or that it would even matter.For a company that is supposed to be somewhat reputable, they are completely unprofessional. Why pay $10 for regular ground shipping for a product that won't even arrive!I recommend choosing a different company!!!"
4,Good brake pad for MTB or hybrid,"As always coolstops ar a good choice, this one is a good choice for bikes with Vee brakes, (linear pull brakes), that don't have removable inserts. Good even stopping power, easy on the rim surfaces, works well in wet weather."
5,POTENT! INEXPENSIVE!,"This is perfectly good oregano oil. I've never seen bad oregano oil, so I don't know what it'd be like. But this seems perfectly fresh, potent, and effective. Oregano oil is amazing! By the way, a lot of ""oregano oil"" you can buy is some other oil WITH oregano oil; this is 100% oregano oil, and it's the cheapest source I've found. GOOD PRODUCT!"
2,Bitter,"I have been using Oregano oil for over a year now for arthritis and other problems, my dog uses it too [with his vets permission]. I always used organic oregano oil from Mt. Rose Herbs, but decided after satisfactorily using a number of NOW oils decided for economic reasons to give NOW oregano oil a try. I don't like it. I don't think it is nearly as therapeutically effective, the taste is blisteringly painful, and the smell is strong and unpleasant.I am a firm believer in the use of essential oils for a number of personal as well as therapeutic uses and while I am far from an expert I've done a great deal of research and I do not recommend this oil, others by NOW yes, oregano oil no."
3,not what i thought,"I saw an ""expert"" on a news show discussing the merits of oregano oil.he felt it was helpful to decrease inflammation.He said it helped diminish allergy symptoms.As an allergy sufferer i was willing to try this.Unfortunately it caused me terrible heartburn.I tried taking 1 instead of 2 at a time but it made no difference.maybe i'll try to use it again but not in a rush.I hope oregano oil does help others.I fear it isn't something for me."
2,Didn't kill my Candida.,"I have bad Candida, to the point where I can see yeast in my bowel movements. I took this product with EVERY meal and it only weakened the Candida. I still have horrid oral thrush and am now trying olive leaf extract. It seems to be only weakening it also. I don't know what to do anymore. Everyone says I can just kill it naturally, but at his right prescription anti-fungals are looking good."
4,These might actually work. Natural anti biotic.,I started to have a little tooth infection over the weekend and started to eat these like Pez and two days later everything is fine. Going to the dentist this week.
3,I can't tell if its helping me,"I bought this for it proclaimed intestinal benefits and for reducing sugar cravings... I think it MIGHT be helping a little bit, but I can't really see a big CLEAR difference. I know that a person has to look at their daily habits and diet in their totality and modify what seems appropriate ... and resulting changes follow very slowly- sometimes so slowly that you don't realize they are happening for quite a while. I bought 2 bottles and I will stick with this until they are gone anyway, and then see how I feel about repeat purchases. Good luck!"
4,Like this product.,"Like this product . It arrived on time. It lasts for a long time, so you can treat the whole family with one bottle."
1,poor quality,"The strength of this is either extremely low, or the quality is poor. Took it for a week with no results. The oragano oil manufactured by Solarray worked almost immediately."
1,BIG BURNING DISAPPOINTMENT!,"My experience with this product, labeled simply ""Oregano Oil, Enteric"" was very much a disappointment! Having previously used ""oregano Oil"", by piercing the caplet/mixing with warm water amd using this as a soothing and extremely successful gargle for sore throat, sinus headache & earaches, I believed what the front of the label read when I ordered it. THIS product is NOT pure oregano oil, but mixed with ginger and fennel oils. Imagine the BURNING when one gargles with this? I'm extremely grateful I used it on myself first, before treating my child! I even tried taking it orally, as directed, only to find this will burn a hole right through your stomach...no thank you. I love ginger; to cook with, candied ginger, even ginger tea...but THIS PRODUCT was simply painful."
4,Passionate Seeing,"""What I Loved"" reminds me of the novels that formed me as a young man, full of rich lives deeply carved by painful losses, lived by characters whose triumphs lay in their capacity to love and to create. The longing and well-seasoned grief of the narrator, who remembers the story as an old man, moves lightly though the telling. But any danger of sentimentality is balanced by the narrator's astringent observations of the New York art world and his rigorous engagement with the process of seeing. He's an art historian and critic and the protagonist, his best friend, is a painter and sculptor. Ms Hustvedt has seamlessly lent her own passion for the visual arts to her characters. Siri Hustvedt is now on my unwritten list of writers and other artists I claim as kin, a secret guest list for a dream-salon in paradise."
3,A lot like Paul Auster,I really liked this book a lot when I started it but the deeper into it I got it reminded me a lot of Paul Auster. I don't know if she's influenced him or he's influenced her but it feels a little like old territory gone over and over and over. I like Auster's writing a lot but for some reason this just seems a bit phony. The descriptions of the artworks are so long and tedious. I found myself skipping them and getting bored. I'm pushing through because I want to find out how it ends but I'm not sure I'd read other books by this author.
4,What I Loved,"This is a cerebral and compelling book, I think especially for those who are interested in art and the art scene. It is also very, very sad. A story of losing everything that mattered to the central character. Most in our book club liked it, but not all."
4,What I Loved: A Novel,"I bought this book and read it for my book club. We all enjoyed it. It is a book written by an adult and for adults, something that cannot be said of all the literature written these days."
2,Very sad book,"I have found this book really wonderfully written, the style is very beautifull. But the book brought me into a very deep depression!!! Everything in this novel is completely hopeless!! The book gives one a feeling that life is ONLY sad: children die or go wrong way in their lives, adults also die, divorce, separate, become un-happy. There is not even one positive event happening in this book!!!! I am really wondering what drives the author to write such a book. Is this an expression of Siri Hustvedt's own un-happiness?.. After reading this book (and after reading a lot of other books from modern literature) I decided to stop reading modern literature at all, and to read only books on history: those will al least give knowledge and information about our past. But the books like ""What I loved"" give no information, but only disturb one's psychological status and bring one to a very bad mood."
5,A Fine Fiction,"Would that there were more novels like this one! Other favorite books of mine - Making History, Crossing To Safety, Fundamentals Of Play, to name a very few - plumb the same veins of character, but Hustvedt is in a class of her own. I've read it twice so far - a keeper I will return to again and again."
3,what i missed,"i really enjoyed the first half of this book. i found the characters interesting and i loved the new york references (i'm a native) but after matt's death, when leo got more involved with mark it turned into a murky, muddled mess. the seedy antics went a little too far, with leo on a grand chase. it really didn't make sense. i missed what could have been a great second half."
2,New York Porn,"THe only reason to read this book is to soak up the street names, professions and pastimes of contemporary Woody Allen-style New Yorkers.The male narrator has no discernible maleness or individuality about him. He is clearly spewing the words of a too-serious, portentous woman writer. The narrative has scarcely any plot until late in the book, when it suddenly turns into an overly dramatic and cliched imitation of a second-rate thriller.How did this book get published in hardback?"
2,I am in the minority but ...,"I found it very difficult to read. The first 100 pages left me cold. It then peaked occasionally ... but it is such a pretentious book! And the complicated family set-up was so ridiculous. At the end, poor Leo. Would he really go through all that for his adolescent 'charge'? I think not.All my book club agreed .. but then we are English... sorry."
3,Disappointing & jarring read,"Like many reviewers have already noted, the most disappointing aspect of this book was the fact that it is two very different stories, somehow packed into one novel. I enjoyed the writing and character development in the first half, but I found it to be slow and without a plot. In what seems to be an attempt to develop a plot, Hustvedt steers the novel in a random, unexpected direction that has absolutely nothing to do with what was set up in the first half. The main character in the second half is barely mentioned in the first 150 pages. I would have enjoyed reading either story, but instead, I felt cheated out of a resolution in the novel I initially thought I was reading."
1,cannot agree with the mostly grand reviews,"I looked forward to reading this book based on the many good reviews that the other reviewers gave this book. However, I cannot agree that this is a good book. In fact, I had to force myself to finish reading it because it grated on my nerves so badly.In my reading, I found the main character unbelievable - first because he did not read as a male, but rather as a female, which confused me. Then I was put off by the observations and descriptions of the art and the art world. It sounded to me like the author was just trying to show off, but that she really did not know what she was talking about.In sum, I found the novel, tricky, trite and pretentious. I would not recommend it nor would I ever read anything else by this author."
5,Augustine of Hippo,"This book was better than my expectations, excellent in giving a description of the late Roman Empire. Also very good in its descriptiAon of 4th century christianity."
5,more than local,"these guys from Baton Rouge are great and this is an excellent collection of new songs, his voice is great and the songs are easy to listen too!"
3,Not too impressed,"This artist will need to do more than give away his music in order to distinguish himself. To me, the tunes on this CD are innocuous, unchallenging and nothing to get excited about. The safe sounds will never jar the listener, and this has some merit, I suppose. But nothing here really stands out, and emotionally I find little to grab hold of. In the background, it won't distract; but as something to closely dwell upon, it gets old fast. So, while I appreciate the free songs and the chance to hear someone new, this music does not leave me wanting any more."
4,GrownUpMusic.com recommended!,"Debi Smith has more talent in one finger than most country superstars have in their whole body. She writes smart, beautiful songs and sings like an angel. As one of the Four Bitchin' Babes, she brings down the house every time she steps up to the mic. So where are all the CMA Awards? We don't get it. But we do get this CD. And every one that Debi releases. It's great down-to-earth country/folk music written and sung by one of the hardest-working women in show business. Can your mom belt out an aria one minute and then pick up an Irish folk drum and rock out the next? Yeah, didn't think so."
2,swing fundamentals,"I expected a breakdown of the entire swing. It was not obvious to me when I ordered this video that it was only vol 1. Vol 2 is needed, I assume, to receive input on the back swing and swing.I feel every thing should be on one tape or there should be a note on the jacket that both vol 1 and vol 2 are needed for a full description of the proper golf swing. Being a beginner, I'm sure I should of known better."
2,eh........,"This book left me cold..I don't know..maybe I've just been spoiled by other books..but ...what a disappointment! The plot to this book was thin and ridiculous..and I had no feelings at all for the characters... I will admit that it had it's moments, but it just barely kept me interested ;if at all.Definitely not something that I would recommend."
5,HILARIOUS KEEPER !!!!!!,"BOY...DID I GET THE ""WOMAN FROM MARS"" LOOKS IN MY HOUSE WHILE READING THIS DELICIOUS PIECE. I AM USUALLY A HICTORICAL NUT BUT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A TERRIFIC READ WITH LIVELY AND SENUOUS CHARACTERS ( I'D LOVE A SEQUEL ABOUT GREGOR AND MILLS, BY THE WAY). I HAVE READ JOY'S OTHER BOOKS AND WAS ALREADY QUITE A FAN BUT SHE REALLY OUTDID HERSELF WITH THIS WITTTY AND FAST PACED STORY THAT IS NOT TO BE MISSED. I HAD AN ADDED BONUS IN THAT THE USED BOOK I BOUGHT HAD A KRANTZ BOOK CALLED WHIRLWIND COURTSHIP THAT WAS ALSO EXTREMELY ENTERTAINING."
3,Not Her Best but Still Fun,"If you're looking for a heart-felt, emotional, love story... forget it. This is no traditional boy-meets-girl, love-blossums-despite-obstacles, couple-gets-married-and-have-kids type of romance novel. Instead, it is a fast-physically-attracted, faster-to-bed and into-a-steamy-sex-filled-relationship kind of book. Zanita, a reporter hot on a story, pairs up with Tyber, a hunk of a physicist, to uncover a conman. A lot of kooky secondary characters actually help save this book and make it a fairly fun read. Tyber has a math-genius/nut-case as a cook who thinks he's on a pirate ship & Tyber's the Captain. Zani has an even zanier aunt who is deadly to Tyber's Harley. Then, there's the couple's friends, Greg and Mills; two characters who actually make me wish THEY were the focus of this book's sequel. Sorry, not so lucky: Instead, Tyber and Zanita return for more sex in HIGH INTENSITY. ..."
5,"Who said ""Geeks"" can't be SEXY?","Well written, Fast Paced,Sexy Romp! Ohhh, just my cup of tea. Wonderful, interesting cast , from the cook to the cat. Ty has a wonderful generous heart, is a sexy, rich hunk & Oh so clever, in his seduction(s). Zanita is a dear sincere woman, who can't spell, & falls asleep at the drop of the hat & just happens to be ""The Women"" for Tyberius Augustus Evans. Plenty of sizzle. enJOY!"
1,Stultifying,"I think I lost brain cells reading this mainly because the author just couldn't stay on task. The book suffered dearly because Ms. Joy was too busy being cute and let the story wander around haphazardly. The bad-guy is so unconvincing that his bits were painful to read. I'd rather have taken on 300 pages of crazy than 300 pages of not funny enough to be comedy, not together enough to be interesting, not serious enough to be convincing.It's sad that fun characters had to languish in a story that didn't suit them at all."
3,Decent Read,"I picked this book up after reading Joy's first book, Knight of a Trillion Stars nearly ten years ago (WOW! TIME MOVES FAST). I was a little disappointed with this book because I thought she had taken kooky to a different level. I expected to hear the Addams family theme every time I turned the page. It was okay. Not here best, but I did enjoy the book as a light hearted read. It didn't make my imagination wonder like the Matrix of Destiny books, but it was fun. I give this book 3 stars because there were some pretty hot scenes and overall it was pretty funny."
1,DARA JOY'S NOVEL HIGH ENERY WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT.,THE FIRST COUPLE OF CHAPTERS STARTED OUT PRETTY GOOD BUT THERE WAS TOO MANY SEX SCENES IN THIS NOVEL. IT WAS ALL THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS (ZANITA & AUGUSTUS) DID IN THIS NOVEL. THERE WERE OTHER CHARACTERS MENTIONED IN THIS BOOK ALSO THAT COULD HAVE DEVELOPED MORE TO MAKE THIS NOVEL MORE INTERESTING. THE STORYLINE BASICALLY JUST DRAGGED ALONG....THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS NOVEL BECAUSE THERE WAS NO STORY THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT WORTHWHILE TO READ.
5,WHAT A BOOK!!!,"This was the first book by Dara Joy that I have read. It was wonderful! It had one of the most incredible couples that I've ever read about. Tyber (my favorite) and Zanita are funny, intelligent, intriguing, and sexy as hell. I couldn't get enough of their HOT and SIZZLING romance. This book is a must read!"
3,Low Energy,"I bought 'High Energy' because I thought it would be as good as Dara Joys other books. I was completely disappointed.Like some other reviewers, I felt that the story ended less than half-way through the book. There was just nothing exciting going on at all.Sure, they get together, but that happens right off. The rest of the book is just about them trying to catch a phony psychic healer, with some humor and romance mixed in. But after Tyber called Zanita 'baby' like 1,000 times, I thought I was going to scream!No offense to Dara because I LOVE TrillionStars/Rejar/ and Mine to Take...but this book just wasn't for me."
4,One fab read!,"I loved Tyber--sexy, smart and wonderful. A little trouble with Zanita. She just didn't quite ring true. Still, Dara Joy is one of my favorite authors and even when she's so-so, she's still miles ahead of most romance authors. If you like to laugh and are looking for a hero to sink your teeth into--this is your book!"
1,blank pages,Dont bother buying this book. I purchased it a month ago and it was blank asked for rfund did not get it. Thought it was something I did so I purchased it again. IT is still blank you get picture of cover and chapter list that is all.
5,My first Dara Joy,"This book, High Energy, was my first taste of this author. I was ""shopping"" for something to read and liked the description. I'm so glad I downloaded it. I read it in a weekend which really would have been only day, but I had to eat.I fell in love with these two people. Please write more about them."
4,Pleased to read,Although book was first put out about 8 or so yrs. Still a good read. Enjoyed it again on Kindle instead of book. Still have book. New Kindle thought it would be a good read as a starter. It was.
2,Eyes to See,"It's a very short movie, for the price on how short it was, is not worth it. The shipment was quick, just not worth the price."
3,"Titillating, self serving and pretty much true.","I've been a Rolling Stones fan for over 25 years. I've read pretty much everything that's come around, usually with a huge grain of salt. This tome by Spanish Tony is ghost written number one, embellished in large part by said 'ghost', and done in some desperation by a drug addict, adjunct to earn a buck. That said, I think most of what is written, transpired in true capacity. In today's mores it ceases to hold such shock value anyway. Mostly true, without the fantasy bits."
3,This is an okay title.,"This book starts off somewhat boring like most Andre Norton titles. If you can get past the boring beginning, most readers can discover this book to be quite interesting."
4,good sci fi,"GOOD SCI FI . FAST READ .EVERYTHING YOU NEED ALIENS, BAD GUYS NEAR DEATH ESCAPES AND SO ON.AND FOR FREE, UNBEATABLE."
4,A Great ReIntroduction to Norton,Thougoughly enjoyable. My only quip is that the two stories are set so far apart. I like both sets of characters I want more of all of them.
5,"This is a ""free"" compilation of two old, but entertaining books: Star Guard & Galactic Patrol.","I first read these books when I was in high school (to show how long ago that was, these books were paperbacks from Ace in the ""D"" price range, $0.35, each!). Both are still good reads. Warning, the technology shown in the books is a bit quaint. Entertainingly so. An example in Galactic Patrol is when the recorder uses a ""wire"" to make a recording ('40s & early '50s high tech). Even in the '60s, we had magnetic tape. Now, well, you get the picture. Just go for it & get the book set & enjoy the adventure.PS. These books were originally focused on the juvenile market. That doesn't distract from the fact that they are both good books to read & you just can't beat the price ($0.00) of the Kindle version. Also, there are some other Andre Norton books that are out there in the ""free book"" marketplace. If you don't find any here, go and check out Project Gutenberg ([...]) for more books."
3,it was play,was not really the type of book I like to read. I am a person of few words so why insist?
4,Riveting,I loved this book and couldn't put it down. The ideas in it are still so true today. It made it an interesting read.
4,Good read,"Andre Norton is a classic in sci-fi. Read several of books, never gets old. Both stories are the type that keeps you up past bedtime."
4,Good Story,Very well developed story and characters. Would have liked to have had more experiences in the universe before the main story began but I understand the story did not allow that. I also wish the story would have ended a little differently but I also have no opnions for an alternate so I really have no room to complain. Good story interesting read.
5,Been a long time,"It's been a long time since I read Andre Norton (over 20years)! Really enjoyed it and brought back many childhood memories. Am trying to find material my kids may enjoy and this could be suitable. Still a good read for adults, too."
3,Somewhat disappointing...,"Over 20 years ago, I read Star Rangers by Andre Norton when I was about 9 or 10. The book blew me away as a child and helped start a life-long love for science fiction.The book has been out-of-print for some time, so when I found Star Soldiers in the library, I was eager to re-read it to see if it ""holds up"". Unfortunately, it doesn't. The writing is solid; I also agree that it's message of tolerance is as timely as ever. However, the basic storyline just wasn't that engaging. It's a good juvenile novel, but nothing special for adults."
3,Worth The Investment,"I normally don't enjoy war/action novels written by women but Andre Norton doesn't feminize her male characters like some other female writers. The two stories contained in this novel aren't vulgar, erotic, or gory but they aren't dull or emotionless either. If you're looking for a solid sci-fi action story to pass the time I don't believe you'll be disappointed with ""Star Soldiers."""
3,still a good read,The future depicted in Star Soldiers was amazing but cannot hold a candle to the future we have received. Norton remains one of my favorite but the writing has aged poorly.
4,Star soldiers,Good read for young adults and the young at heart ! Andre Norton does not disappoint. Timeless reading for the ages.
1,Tissot PR 50 Automatic Watch Not Worth It,"I bought a women's Tissot PR 50 Automatic 5 years ago. Within the first year, it started losing a few seconds every day, and this susequently grew to minutes per day. When I took it in for repairs to a certified Tissot repair shop, it was still under the 24-month warranty. When I got it back, it worked well for about another 12 months, and then started losing time again. When I took it in the second time for repairs, I was informed that it would cost $220. I contacted Tissot directly - they did not offer any help, other than to suggest a repair shop, and I declined their offer knowing the shop I dealt with was reputable and that I wouldn't get a better price elsewhere. I had no intention of paying $220 to repair a $400 watch with no guarantee that it would work well for any duration after that. The watch is therefore useless now. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,More bootleg garbage from the underbelly of life,"Who wants to buy garbage made in some Bubba's basement? If you do, you deserve what you get. This is not an APPLE product. This is garbage. Stuff stolen from vaults and copied off TV. It's unauthorized trash. The artists deserve better than this substandard rubbish. Respect the Fab Four. Respect yourself. Do not buy this garbage."
1,JUNK!!!!!!,I too bought this so called video collection and the songs are all messed up! you don't get half the songs that was stated in the AD. total rip off! SAVE YOUR MONEY!
1,Disappointed,"My kids generally love the Barney videos, so I was extremely dispointed when we watched this movie and discovered that it's not actually about Easter at all. There is a segment about bunnies (not the Easter bunny specifically#, a segment about Mother Goose #I have no idea how she is related to the celebration of Easter), and a segment about ducks and fish. There is no egg-hunt, no Easter bunny, no jelly beans, nothing! I am hoping to be able to return this movie and find something that truly is an EASTER movie."
3,reply,shipment time was good. also i like the design and material that was used in making this product. thankx!
1,These are not Basset's Allsorts from Britian...an imitation.,I bought these thinking I would be getting the same taste as the Licorice Allsorts from Britian...Not even close. Strange taste and hard. Be careful if you are looking for the famous Allsorts.
2,Printer refused to use unopened ink cartridge,"Upon putting a brand-new black ink cartridge into my printer, it displayed the message ""Supply Expired"" and refused to use the ink. These cartridges cost more than $20 each, and the printer menu offered no way to override this problem."
3,Paul Myers and BNL,"Favorite line: ""The Stunt tour was great, but so was Kevin.""?!It's well worth the cost and read for any Barenaked Ladies fan, but prepare yourself for backseat reading as the story is mainly of Paul's experience with the band rather than the band's story. The first half (up to Stunt) is great, but the second half is a bit thin.Perfect back-of-the-toilet book."
1,"4 "" Louver Vent Face Material problem",I had bought 200 pcs for a project used. The 200 pcs you send to me has two different type of material. One PVC is soft and good. a lot is hard pvc with is easily crack. I did not count how many quantity for that. The hard PVC material type of Louver Vent face cannot last long under rain and sun. Will be crack after time. Even during installation the screw had break the vent cover. I feel disappointed.
4,Power in the box,"Easy to install, though the instructions say 'intended to be professionally installed', I wonder if that means I'm a professional. My system has been running smooth and QUIET, I have check to confirm it's on sometimes. Works great for me."
4,Great sound funky retro looks,"It gave me totally great sound, no buzzing a low bass and not extremely high in tweet pitch.And every one giggling how its look when see me wearing it."
3,Beautiful and comfortable but bad sound.,"These headphones are good looking and feel great, even over extended periods of time, and surprisingly, even if you are wearing glasses. But the sound leaves much to be desired. The high end is good, bass is great, but the mid range sounds very soft and undefined. You get used to it, but most audiophiles would scoff at this flaw. Then again most audiophiles wouldn't settle for $37 headphones. I would say the headphones are definitely priced appropriately.The mid range can be fixed with considerable tweaking of the equalizer if your mp3 player supports it. The ipod presets don't do it."
2,A little disappointed,"I bought these for my wife for christmas. She used them a few times and now they just sit by their lonesome on the shelf. Well here's the deal. They're good for working on my laptop, they fit good over the ears, and, the color is a nice pure white, and, they keep the sound in, but, they don't convey the music very good, and, the cord is too short, unless you like hooking up the extention! I think ALL headphones should have a 6' cord (minimum). I like my $14 jensen headphones better if I could find another pair I'd buy them. My wife took mine from me. Man oh Man! I want'em back! But I also wanna keep peace in the family. Heh Heh Heh. They had a long cord and the sound quality was excellent. Oh well."
3,OK for the price,...However I do prefer the AKG K-66 with an airier sound and comfort. These are more private though.
3,"Decent sound, but not very comfortable","These over-the-ear headphones look really stylish and have pretty good sound quality, but I find them too tight -- they pinch my ears -- and I get a headache wearing them for just a couple of minutes."
2,By No Means DJ Headphones-Light and Cheap,"I read that some DJ's were using these headphones for in Club use and were happy with their performance. So I thought that I would give them a shot for $40; just for back up and see if they worked out. The styling alone would be a welcomed change and was my incentive. However, the headphones are smaller than I thought (even though they are 40mm drivers), flimsy and leak a considerable amount of outside noise. I would never recommend these for a DJ. Low end is hollow and difficult to discern. Therefore, one would have to turn the volume up considerably to hear the distinctions between the kick and snare drums in a live cue; all the while the headphone signal will have to compete with the outside club noise leaking in...again...more volume. Hence: HEARING DAMAGE! Performance of these validate about a $25 price point. Styling may warrant close to the $40; if you're more into look than sound. I recommend these as an accessory for your personal media player."
3,Good Creep Prop but .....,This piece and the accompanying male bust are effectively creepy looking for a haunted house but beware of the following two cons: 1. The back piece is completely flat (which may make ideal for hanging on the wall) and 2. They weigh almost nothing (not the 20 lbs as advertized)so not sure why it cost so much to ship. Disclaimer: I purchased mine from another seller.
5,Cats Are Funny People,It's always amazing what cats can(& do)get into. You can almost see them think. There's always something about them that is almost human. They can surely work their way into your heart..
2,It was not a dance dvd not for dancing,I expected a more dance related video this was not and their was more talking than movement.
4,Excellent Book from The Bombay Natural History Society,"This is an excellent book from the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) and published by the OUP. It is a book that gives the complete list of all the different species and sub-species with the modern geographical and geo-geographical boundaries. A must for any bird watcher, amatuer or prefessional, student or researcher, bird lover and traveller to the great Indian Sub-continent.This book shall be a great value addition when read with other great titles and publications of the BNHS"
3,Better Title: Intro to Statistics using Excel Add-ins,"On the positive side, this book has many excellent case studies and examples. It is well written and interesting. However, I was disappointed, as I was expecting use of Excel to rigorously solve decision making and data analysis problems. The focus of the book is mostly traditional statistics solved using a group of commercial add-ins for Excel. If this is what you want, then the book would get five stars. However, for data analysis and decision making, I think a more thorough treatment using Excel without relying so much on the add-ins would have been appropriate."
5,No trouble with Excel,"I find the text and software a useful set of tools. It assumes familiarity with basic statistics and Excel, and builds on them to develop a powerfull ability to analize data and make decisions from it. I experienced no trouble with the software install or operation."
5,almost too cute to eat... almost,"There are two types of folks in this world - those who love licorice and those who hate it. I have never met anyone who is indifferent toward licorice. When you ask someone, do you like licorice, the response is almost always ""I hate..."" or ""I love..."" and never a ""eh - I don't care.""Amazing detail in these tiny Scotties - almost looks like the Monopoly playing piece in edible form. These nice bite-size bits are a bit easier on the jaw, since you're not ripping a bite from a thick licorice twist or whip. Not only are they convenient, they are adorable and a fun item to have in a covered candy dish for company!"
5,Refreshing read!,"This book was powerful. It was well-written and captured the pioneering spirit of Hudson Taylor. I also appreciated how this autobiography captured firsthand the impressions that Dr. Taylor made on others. This book was truly inspiring - especially the sections where it chronicles Taylor's inner struggles of finding his joy and sufficiency in Christ, the many instances when God answered his prayers during times of his greatest need, and his devotion to his family."
5,The evolution of mind via Free Will,"The Ithon represents multiple methods of delving into the future that every single human being on this planet can accomplish. The Abstraction Layer or thereabouts is an essential facet to the development of the human mind. This is a compilation of random thoughts that resonate a chord of humanity into the soul of people. It describes solutions to the deepest of problems that our species has faced and will face. They may not all happen however I think it's important for everyone to read this book. It is filled with dreams. It is filled with a future. Not ""THE"" future, a future. We are all responsible to create the best future possible. Human beings are free will oriented. Love fully, dream always. I would much rather aim for a star and hit an eagle than aiming for the eagle and hit a rock. This book is a must read."
1,amcor air conditioner,"I do not recoment this product.Service not good,very noisy,instalation manual not available,remote control do not keep corect time."
1,deceptive advertising,"Warning! This is just the faucet, not an actual ""instant hot water dispenser."" The total package is much more expensive. This is a misleading banner for the item."
1,Piece of Junk,"We've replaced this item three times in four years. It's been replaced under warranty, but the warranty doesn't cover the flooding beneath the sink when the tank leaks. Avoid this one..."
3,"Convenient, but problematic","I had this unit for 4 years before the tank failed. Unfortunately, the tank warranty is only 3 years. You'd think the heating element would go bad, but the tank actually developed a crack in it, and the unit would leak. After checking to see if I could buy just the tank, I found that several people had the same problem.When working properly, it's great to have instant hot water to make tea, hot chocolate, or coffee, but I think I'm going to look at other brands and check their reviews before committing to another product by Insinkerator."
3,bad taste from plastic tank,We replaced our original Insinkerator hot water dispenser after 20 years. Loved it! But the new one has been in just 3 years and the water has developed a bad taste - like old plastic. All insinkerator tells me is that it must be my water supply. This has unchanged in over 10 years so that is not the issue. Replacing a $150 unit with a $280 stainless tank is rediculous. May have to shop for a different brand.
3,InsinkErator,"Tank leaked after one year. Water damage to cabinet flooring. Not happy. However, on warranty which included ""in house"" tank replacement at no charge. Will further advise of any issues with replacement unit."
3,faucet control unit,this was a used/like new part that performs poorly it leaks after use constantly it looks new but works poorly
1,Tank failed less than 2 yr,"Like many others, my tank developed a leak that became worse over time. InSinkErator customer service was horrible and said that their warranty was only a year. Never again! We installed the hot water dispenser from Waste King (bought at Costco) that is available here in Amazon at our vacation home. After 2 years, it performs flawlessly. Besides being reliable, the Waste King is also much less expensive than the InSinkErator."
1,Design,"Poor product life, misleading packaging, poor instructions. Had to return the purchase once to Loews and once to Home Depot for either missing components or or incompatible parts as between the faucet commection and the tank. They have changed the design so the know something was wrong"
1,Very short life span,"We installed the original product in 2002, and this is now the 2nd replacement -- which averages out to a lifetime of 3 years. This is a terrible record for a premium product."
4,This model is fine with granite countertops,"Some InSinkErator models do not fit granite countertops, but I checked the specs (3"" max counter thickness), talked to my kitchen contractor and the countertop company, and ordered this model in spite of the warnings in the reviews. It installed quickly and easily with my granite countertops and undermount sink. Just stick with the 1100."
4,"So far, so good","Okay, Insinkerator, you got my attention. I have seen your responses to some of the negative reviews, and noticed that you've increased your warranty to 5 years in an effort to regain consumer trust. Here's hoping you've taken all the negative feedback on your instant hot water products, and made improvements.I installed this model in my house, and have been using it for several months now. Love the design, love the ease of temperature adjustment, love the easy-to-operate lever. Whatever problems there used to be in installing on granite counters is no longer a problem...my contractor installed it with a standard size hole.If this holds up, I'll adjust my rating up to 5 stars."
5,DIY for the DIY Challenged,"I have not used a soldering iron in 20 plus years, and I know little about electronics, but this guide walks you through the materials list, how to do what needs to be done, gives several options for the moonlights, and is well written easy to follow. I recommend this guide to anyone who would like to save a chunk of change while having the enjoyment of knowing you did it your self. I have recommended this to several others, and have heard nothing but good comments about it."
4,Great fusion cooking book,"The recipes are first-rate. I do a lot of ""real"" Asian cooking, and I find Hom's recipes a fabulous blend of ""western"" style cooking fused with ""Asian"" combinations of ingredients. Each recipe I've tried is straightforward with easy-to-follow directions, easy-to-find ingredients, and produces supreme results. My children, who often turn up their noses at Asian food, really like everything I've tried out of this book.The only reason why I didn't give this cookbook 5 stars are because there are a few editorial errors in it. I believe there's a new edition out -- I'd try that one first to see if the errors are fixed -- mostly dealing with page numbers not matching in the front explanatory section of the book."
3,At least I don't lose my hood pins.,They work well but they started to rust within three days. Haven't really rusted since then. They just rusted a little and stopped.
5,A Fast Paced Action Techno-Thriller,"M.E. Blount has created a first class thriller. It is a reader-grabbing cross between a sophisticated spy techno-action tale and an intricate crime novel. The technical research and detail are complete, as is the character and plot development. The story has a number of unanticipated and riveting twists keeping the reader guessing as to how the story will proceed. Frankly, don't start this book until you have some time to spare because you won't be able to put it down. The review by James Hursey is accurate, but I must give it 5 stars. This is a super story, one that should not be missed. I am looking forward to more works by Blount."
5,The book is a must read for all the top management,The book is a must read for the top managemet who are concerned about their business.
4,A Must for Consultants,"If you are a business consultant, you should read this book to better understand what is going on in your field. If you are thinking of hiring a business consultant, you should read this book to know what to look for. It looks at trends in management consulting and their real life consequences, some good and some not so good. This book demonstrates how dangerous it can be to apply any management theory without a thoughtful and thorough examination of the systems necessary for the theory to work. The biggest downside to this book is the authors ""cleverer than thou"" style."
2,A Yawn from Start to Finish,One of the most boring books that I have read in a long time. It has nothing constructive to offer.
1,What the Management Gurus Are Saying and Why It Matters,"I intrest in this, but i don`t know nothing about this boo"
3,'sokay,"Parts of this book are interesting, but the same topics are covered better elsewhere by Spring and others. This seems like a tame, watered-down version of some of the ideas that are currently being discussed in education... a textbook for teacher ed students, whom the teacher ed universities don't want to shock too much. Spring's earlier work is more exciting.Instead of this book check out ""The Right to Learn,"" by Linda Darling-Hammond. It's better documented, more passionate, more complete, and more interesting. Also check out Spring's work ""The Cultural Transformation of a Native American Family and its Tribe."""
1,What a shame,"How sad it is that such ""Good"" music has been redone in an update that puts it in with the current thump beat, no value, not understandable trash that permeates the dials now.I'd hoped for a good makeover. Indeed, not the case!"
1,Why Mess With Perfection?,"Herb Alpert was one of the most ""musical"" producersof the 60's. Few realize just how ""hip"" he was.He also had the exquisite good taste to bring usthe Carpenters, Sergio Mendes & Burt Bacharach.But from the mid-70's on...his music lost it's spirit.I keep hoping it will return...butRE-WHIPPED is no exception.On a high note..his ""trumpet playing"" sounds betterthan ever. But tearing apart a 'classic' and addingstreet grooves is UN-HIP & UN-SATISFYING.Rob ResetarTucson,AZ"
1,DOES HERB ALPERT NEED MONEY OR PUBLIC RECOGNITION?,"Mr. Alpert is 71 and has had many successes so the question is why ruin his own classic. If he needs the money, ask for a loan, don't ruin your reputation. If he needed to go on the Tonight Show again with Leno, write a book or tell a story, dont bash a classic.I would have hoped that he had friends honest enough to say ""Herb, it stinks, leave well enough alone man"". But alas, its out there for all to hear and be embarrased for him.He doesn't the money. Sadly he needed the limelight again. But not this way. Make terrific music again. Don't ruin what had worked.We can hope he tries with original material next time and not live off the past.The one thing this release did accomplish, it made me listen to the original again. Great stuff."
1,Absolutely Dreadful!,"When I heard about this title, I was really looking forward to hearing the CD. What a disappointment! Thank you amazon.com for the samples, so I could find out how much this new release s*cks! How did Herb Alpert ever get talked into this? I will keep listening to the remaster of the original album. As far as I am concerned, this is another reason why ""rap"" is simply a word missing a ""C"" as the first letter!"
3,Tripped Cream,"Wow...I just don't know about this...this is definitely a toss up. It's good but it's not. It's good that so many young artists were inspired by this incredible record of the 60s but it's just not the original and the original is a classic in every sense of the word.I'm not going to say don't waste your time because it is a very interesting production and it is worth a listen or two and who knows, maybe young kids buying this album will be so ""jazzed"" by this take on a classic that they'll buy the classic, as well.I may be getting up in years, but I'm not some ""fuddy duddy"". I listen to what sounds good...what moves me...what awakens in me that something I call ""soul"". I like acid jazz, trip hop, and ambient music because it does try to incorporate classic jazz with a cool vibe and many times it does succeed in winning over my soul.Listen to your soul and you decide. And by the way, both album covers are GREAT! I never have a problem with gorgeous women and whipped cream..."
2,wish I had read the reviews more closely,I gave this CD 2 stars instead of 1 because a couple of the tracks do work...most of them do not though. The ones that don't are anywhere from ho-hum to sounding like bad infomercial music. Live and learn...my copy will be for sale pretty soon.
2,A Bit Bizarre...,"You're in the Dentist's chair, and you're breathing in the laughing gas; to the room on the right, they're playing the original ""Whipped Cream"" CD, and to the room on the left, they're playing some weird techno-drum music. To you, in your doped-up state, it sounds like ... well, buy this CD and find out."
1,How to sour whipped cream,I had an original 33 1/3 recording that I wanted to replace but was wise enough to listen to the samples available first. I couldn't believe anyone could think it would be improved be adding so much overpowering clutter. Don't buy this one. Get the original version.
1,Another sequel flops badly,"In the years since Herb Alpert had his big success with the original ""Whipped Cream"" album, we have seen -- and, unfortunately, heard -- pop music dominated by disco and rap, and a generation or two of recording engineers have grown up without ever acquiring any taste or, it seems, functional ability to hear. Sadly, Alpert has allowed several members of the new generation to fiddle with the tracks from his classic album. The results are uniformly unfortunate: lumbering, bass-heavy rhythm tracks stapled to music that succeeded because it was frothy and fun. No fun here, folks. Avoid it."
1,Buy the original Whipped Cream & Other Delights,"I am a long time Herb Albert fan, but I don't recommend this CD. Stick to the original sound track."
1,A good idea gone bad,This album is so terrible I am recycling it to the trash. Want TJB and Whipped Cream? Buy the original. The Re-Whipped cover falls flat also.
2,Dissapointment Plus!,"I have fond memories of the original, which was about in my early 20's and was looking forward to some nostalgia with a version which may have been digitally enhanced or incorporate some other improvement. WRONG!I am unable to to warm to the Re Whipped version, possibly because I am a genuine fan of Herb Alpert and The T.J.B..This version should appeal more to Moog lovers."
2,New but definitely not better,"Listening to this new CD, I thought it sounded much slower than the original. Was my memory off after a few decades? I later listened to the original LP and found it was this new CD, not my memory, that was off. The original has real pep. This CD seems about to enter siesta mode. The good news is that there are now many 4 in 1 players on the market that give listeners the opportunity to play the original LP and hear this great album, one of the classics of all time."
1,How To Ruin A Classic!!!,"I grew up listening to the ORIGINAL ""Whipped Cream & Other Delights"" and other albums by Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass and can't believe Herb actually participated in this hip-hop rap-crap nightmare!!! It's obvious he wanted to appeal to the under 25 crowd and in doing so alienated those who loved the original classic albums released back in the 1960's and re-released by the same Shout Factory label last year. I am praying this will not sell and soon go out of print like so many other worthwhile artists' cd catalogs of the past have done in recent years. This is no better than what most of us are subjected to in summer with the windows down, forced down your throat by the younger crowd with their rap-crap noise pollution from their 500 watt stereos in their cars. I can't believe Herb Alpert would participate in or even sanction such trash!!! Save your hard-earned money and definitely pass this one up!"
2,Wondering If This Is a Joke,"WARNING: This is more than a remix. It is a totally different album. The original 1960s version of Whipped Cream and Other Delights was not exactly a serious work of art, but it did sell extremely well. I have it on LP and play it occasionally to time travel back to the non-rock 'n' roll part of the 60s. In 2005 the album was remastered and now sounds excellent. Then this remix was released the following year, but it almost sounds like a parody of the original. Because Herb Alpert is capable of very good work (Rise is a fine example), I was hoping that this remix would update the original to the point where we might consider it almost a work of art. The exact opposite seems to be the case. This cd is not the least bit serious. So, I am thinking that it is a joke. Not a bad joke, just a joke. It is kind of funny. It is also kind of weird. I am glad that I got it from the library instead of buying it."
5,enjoyed it,enjoyed it. was a big fan of Herb Alpert and TJB. Saw them in concert in 1968 I think it was. Still have all those TJB Records. Ripped em to cd.
2,if you liked the original - DON'T BUY THIS,"I made the mistake of thinking remixing meant ""cleaning up"" the scratches, whatever, of the sound track. Some idiot went in and changed the music. Tempo, everything is wrong. If you loved the original as I did, get the cd based on the original soundtrack - don't be mislead. This is an abomination."
3,Not for the Alpert loyalists or the beat masters......,"As many here, I was expecting some exciting sounds on this re-mix project, but was disappointed by the continual down tempos. The producer must have ""decided"" that the older, senior Alpert fans would need slow tempos to get comfortable with a re-mix of their old favorites.Alpert's originals could have been re-done so much better than this. Bad decision making by somebody that was more concerned with who the audience would be, rather than the quality of updating the music."
1,El Stinko!,Do yourself a favor. Buy the original releases before the TJB adopted the ELEVATOR sound. The new stuff STINKS!
4,whipped again...,"The original version of this album (and the album cover, natch) was one of my favorites as a young boy... my folks had all of Herb's albums. This new version updates the originals into the modern ""lounge age"" without destroying the original melodies in the process. One might even ask for more experimentation in some cases (the ""Taste of Honey remix"" for example). Standouts here include the ""Whipped Cream"" remix, ""Green Peppers,"" and ""Love Potion #9"" (with great vocals by Ozomatli). Herb himself even overlays trumpet on a few of the tracks, a nice touch. Overall, the mood is fun, relaxed, and, paired with the original album, gives you a great ""taste"" of how today's electronica pairs with yesteryear's pop tunes."
3,Not their best but a good listen,"I liked their older albums better, but this is still a good buy for a New Amsterdams fan."
3,Just frustrating,"Strange album...the first two songs ""Death of us"" and ""Turn out the Light"" are insanely good. Two of my very favorite songs that when I play them for friends are instantly wowed as well. But the rest of the album is shockingly bad. I don't understand it...if they did the rest anywhere close to the first two this would have to be one of my favorite albums. Therefore, I tried their latest release and apparently these guys only have two good (great) songs in all. Bummer..."
2,save your money,"Matt Pryor is great, but this album isn't.It's all very slow tempos but not all melancholic.It was produced poorly and even the vocals are pitchy on ""intelligent design""It really felt like he just didnt try on this album.By far the worst of all New Am cds."
1,Reprise? No thanks!,"If the first two songs reel you in, the rest of the songs are destined to reel you out. This album suffers from several problems: it clocks a little under 30 minutes, and the 8 pleasurable minutes of it are sure not worth the 14 bucks. Furthermore, the songs range from uninteresting (Your Ghost) to downright obnoxious (Intelligent Design) so that there's very little left to add to the instaneous likability of The Death Of Us and Turn Out The Light. Beautiful Mistake is the perfect example of how all the musicians sound great except for the singer himself, where the nice melody gets strangled by his naggy way of singing. This pattern continues throughout more songs. Pity... save your money on this mini-album-slash-EP."
1,You'd have to be desperate,"A person would have to be very desperate to pay $25 for 2 twelve-packs of soda. A twelve pack in the store can be had for as low as $2.50 on sale, $4 worst-case. What's more, adding $45 for shipping is gouging in the worst way. If Squirt isn't available locally, you're better off buying some on vacation and taking it back on the plane with you."
3,It's better than a bucket of cold water poured over your head!,"The pro's of this item is that it's compact, will fit anywhere really, even in a beach bag. The price is great for what you get too.The Con's are that the water pressure is like a slow sink faucet.I consider this a great buy!"
4,Coleman Camp Shower,"This shower is a handy little unit. Works as advertised and my wife and daughter will really appreciate it during our primative site camping trips. By the way, I shopped around and saved quite a bit ordering from Amazon - mostly on the shipping charges."
3,Not bad,"It is not a bad product when it is working, I took it with me on a 6 day camping trip on the Aves islands of the coast of Venezuela. The only thing is that i would not alwys turn on, I would need to take out the batteries and adujst the clips at the bottom so it would work, not funny when you are full of soap"
3,Really good,"The theme, sung by Captain Beefheart in full reincarnated-Howlin' Wolf splendor, is a joy (too bad they didn't include the uncensored version as well)--you can't help but turn it up really loud. Ry Cooder's slide work is impressive, especially his acappella solo on ""Zeke, Jerry, and Smokie."" Other instrumental restatements of the title theme are average-good. The nonoriginal songs (especially Satin Sheets) fit in well."
2,"Horrible ending. Disgusting, long and NOT romantic","Sigh, a horrible ending. Disgusting, long and NOT romantic. A disappointment. Strange but the lead characters resembled each other so, it seemed incestuous...creepy. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
4,Works as advertised,"After making adjustments for a few minutes it fit nicely on my daughters head. Because of the elastic straps, it also fit well on my son's head. The padding looks tough enough to last for years and the welded assembly looks like a good quality job. This mask should get the job done for quite a few years at a very reasonable cost."
2,NOT SHARP ENOUGH!!!,"I'm sad to say I didn't have a pleasant experience with these scissors on the first use, so I haven't used them since. They aren't sharp enough to prevent tugging on the hair, and sense my Pomeranian is very sensitive to such, I'm unable to utilize them :("
3,Helpful,"These are helpful when I cut my husband's hair. The scissors are a little tricky to use. I have to be careful not to pull away from his hair after cutting, rather open them back up or I pull his hair with them."
5,Great!,These have made my work so much easier! My dog is much happier and looks beautiful now! Easy to use and stays sharp!
5,Thinning shears,I was happy with my purchase of thinning shears and Amazon got the article to me in due time as usual.
2,Voyeur's view of literature,"Question: are book 'collectors' educated, or do they merely have a fetishistic reverence for education? Yes to the latter (this book might be better titled Basbanes: The Inner Schoolteacher Unmasked); as to the former - well, up to a point, Lord Copper. Question: Basbanes seems impressed that Scott Fitzgerald thought Scott Moncrieff's Proust 'a masterpiece in itself'- or impressed with himself for having unearthed this dubious nugget - but what, pray, does Basbanes think? Answer: he doesn't think; he genuflects"
3,"Dull, Dull, Dull","I love books and this was painful to read. Unless you collect books or are very much into non-fiction, skip it!"
3,"No, no, no...","Comparable to the case of the Goodfellas soundtrack, this is missing quite a bit of material. Why is it so hard to make a thorough compilation that has few, or no, omissions? I don't get it. I won't buy this based on the fact that it has absolutely none of the NYPD Emerald Society Pipes and Drums compositions on either of the two disks released. If this is the score, then where are the scores? Not putting the ""Theme from Symphony No. 5 in E Minor"" Dvorak (performed by NYPD E.S.P.&D) is simply inexcusable. That was a very poignant moment in the movie, the funeral scene at the end, and is near impossible to find. Anyone know where to find this?"
1,Saint Nicholas Secret,"The book was small. In it's entirity it was less than 100 pages. It was written for children, but it used the ""grown up"" words. The book's message was double spaced and when the chapters ended, a large waste of paper. There were many blank pages in the book. There was 9 blank pages to page 97. Pages 98 to 107 were blank. Page 108 had Printed in the United States with a number underneath that and a Bar Code to the lower right of the page. page 109 was the blank inside cover. To start the story, the inside cover was page 1 and it was blank. About this book started on page 9. A Christmas Prayer started on page 15. I prefer to read about St. Nicholas from the church's web page."
1,Don't Be Fooled!!,"This product is almost 30% sugar! (18 grams out of 63 grams in the single-serve box) That's a greater sugar content than in ice cream or pecan pie, and much more than in Frosted Mini-Wheats. It's over four teaspoons of sugar. This single small box has 240 calories. Be careful with fat-free or low-fat products---they are often high in sugar and calories."
1,So Disappointed!,"I am a great fan of Ross's original The Little Noisy Book and have a very worn version so I jumped at the chance to get the new book....but I am very disappointed. This version is very condensed (only 10 pages vs. 25 in the original). Furthermore, the pages in the new book are out of sequence. In the original book, there is a wonderful flow and rhythm to the text but not in this re-arranged version. While the illustrations and text are the same, this book lacks the sweet charm and wonderful flow of the original."
2,The Little Noisy Book -- 2003 edition,"I ordered this book b/c my son and daughter loved the original (1989) book. But when I received this 2003 edition, I sincerely thought I only received half the book. Then I saw that the few pages I did receive were out of sequence and figured this must be the new edition. On the back it says ""Originally published in slightly different form by Random House, Inc., in 1989 as a Chunky Book."" And I thought, ""slightly, my a**!"" I was SO disappointed. And the saddest thing is that I think they cut out the best parts and left only a shell of the rest. I wonder who's in charge of the editing and how they got their job. If you want this book, make sure you get the 1989 edition."
2,fluffy,"Their are no real techniques for improving memory, I was disapointed. Most of the audio is more of a motivational tape then a aide for improving brain effichiency and memory. If you have low self esteem this is probably a book that might help you. Their was some relevent information on the biological foundations of behavior and mind functioning, but it looks at these aspects more from a perspective of how they function as opposed to giving strong concrete techniques for improving memory and functioning. These concepts (without the fluff) can be picked up in almost any intro psychology book with a quicker explanation."
4,John Evans Band AC/DC meets Buddy Holly,"JEB's third album circling the drain is a well balanced album loaded with incredibly catchy tunes. A mixed breed all in its own, John Evans Band artfully combines Rock And Roll and Old Country.Although the band members that recorded this album are no longer part of the show. The new band leans out the country a touch and it runs rich with rock and roll. Expect a new album out this spring."
3,John Evans,"There are some great sons on this C.D.,Its too cool for counrty and too country for cool.Just buy it and you judge."
3,a recepie for Barley Cakes,"Take 1 part Asop fables1 part parables of Jesusmix in a cup of new age feel good pap and read for about an hour or until completly bored.the result is ""Barley Cakes parables for the twenty first century"".While the over all message of ""Barley cakes"" is not bad it lacks the insight and wisdom of the parables of Jesus nor does it have the simplicity of the asop fables.""Barley Cakes"" is best served to those who are luke warm or in small portions to children as a bed time snack.Bottom line "" barley cakes is a bland read that gets a ""A"" for effort and message but a ""D"" for content."
4,Interesting,"How They Invented the Airplane is probably the best Wright Brothers biography yet. It's written by my favorite author of the genre, Russell Freedman. (Lincoln: A Photobiography)The only thing that made the book a little less enjoyable was the lack of information about the childhood of Orville and Wilbur. Also, I found myself asking questions about The Wright's parents and and siblings, who were weakly potrayed in the book Every other bit of information was intact, and the affect was this great book."
5,product review,My book arrived in a timely fashion in excellent condition as described. i would definitely purchase from this vendor again.
4,The Quickest Way to Learn the Wrights Story,"When I began working on a documentary about the WRight Brothers, this book was recommended to me by a descendant of the Wright Family as the best short version of the Wright Brothers story. I heartily agree. Great pictures accompany a text that manages to tell the whole story without ever getting bogged down. Good for kids and adults who are curious to know the whole story."
1,His Interview Was Terrible,"I am currently listening to this author on a radio interview. He thinks he is cute and witty and is stepping all over the interviewer and making for a really bad interview. How good can this book be? Based on his ""selling"" of the book, I wouldn't even bother. Who says free publicity is always good?"
4,You can't get this elsewhere,"Eckberg has managed to sit down with movers and shakers; Trump, Pelz, Longaberger, and yes, Jerry Springer (who is actually cooler than you would guess), and a bunch of others you've heard of and some you haven't, for a peek into what makes someone successful, or as the cover says, a ""trailblazer."" I was surprised at what these people said, and how, left to their own devices, away from traditional media, soundbites and their PR people, just responded to the author's sometimes goofy and off the cuff questions. He asks Deepak Chopra how to interpret the fact that he and his friends were fishing and not catching anything and then happened upon a stream of dead fish floating through their legs. Interesting in the least. It really is conversations, so don't be expecting career advice laid out for you-- you have to intepret what to take from these discussions. unique to say the least."
5,"READ A LITTLE, LEARN A LOT","I am enjoying The Success Effect because you can open to any page, read a little and learn a lot. My main take away is that the road to success is often ""the road less traveled"". The Success Effect has story after story of business case studies where the success was fueled by non-conventional strategies. It was a matter of seeing things in a completely different way, or just seeing needs, which could be converted to opportunities. Speaking of seeing, my favorite story so far is the Lens Crafters story.Bob KramerAuthor of Revolutionary Retailing"
2,Intermittent problems with Sony BP T16 portable phone battery,The jury is still out on the performance of this battery. I received this battery and installed it in my portable Sony phone. I installed the product and charged it for 24 hours before actually having to use the phone. I am experiencing intermittent problems with the phone when receiving phone calls. It will ring but when answering there is no calling party responding. I removed the battery and reinstalled it but no change. I will continue to monitor this problem.
1,Wrong Wrong Wrong,"The first line in the Inferno is ""Nel mezzo del camin del nostra vita."" This translates roughly as ""In the middle of the journey of our life."" The first line in this translation is ""In the middle of the journey my life."" Translational freedom aside, ""nostra"" is the Italian possessive pronoun for ""our"" not ""my."" Part of the point of the Inferno is that the reader goes with Dante and Virgil. Changing ""our"" to ""my"" cahnges the entire point and tenor of the poem. When a translation has this glaring an error in the first line, it does not bode well for the rest of the text. On a less academic note, this version does not have the original Italian on the opposite page. Even to non-speakers, the original language is still beautiful to read in comparison to the English. My opinion in the world of Dante scholars may not carry much weight, but for what little weight it has, this translation is bad bad bad."
3,Disappointing,A client raved to me about this book so I ordered it. I didn't find it easy to read (perhaps because it was translated into English?) and thought I'd read other branding books that were more on point.
5,"Frank Lloyd Wright--the Lost Years, 1910-1922: A Study of Influence",It's not a typical coffee table picture book. It is focused on the more technical issues relating to Wright's designs style.
4,missing time,"grown-up hippie, willa jansson, a truly unique practioner of law, launches an outer limits defense of a mycologist accused of vehicular manslaughter. defense experts provide a veritable symposium on unexplained phenomena. engagingly wacky tone and wide ranging speculation complete with a bibliography."
4,A war film ahead of its time,"I found 'Sahara' to be a spectacular film. Bogart's performance is brilliant, just like in 'Casablanca.' He plays a no-nonsense American tank commander stuck behind enemy lines in North Africa at a crucial time when the Germans are pushing east towards Egypt. (I had no idea that American forces were even in North Africa at this time in the war, even before Patton landed at Morocco in late 1942). Though at first glance the film appears to be an action war movie, it's really much more. It addresses subjects such as race, politics, and certain ethical questions. And the visual imagery is quite creative - notice how in one scene the falling sand appears to be like a cascade of water. All in all, this film was ahead of its time. I highly recommend it."
4,Sahara,"Highly reminiscent of THE LOST PATROL (1934) with the dreary pacifism & incompetent dunderheads replaced with stirring propaganda and can-do grit. The soldiers still die 1 by 1, but somehow it's not a bummer, and the story takes precedence over the obligatory speechifying. Like LIFEBOAT, it's an Allies-in-microcosm movie, replete w/ an evil kraut in their midst. Wonderful Miklos Rosza score. 8/10"
4,TOP NOTCH WAR FILM,"Starring Humphrey Bogart, SAHARA is a well-made World War II adventure about a tank command in North Africa. Bogart's tough as nails in the lead role as Sgt. Joe Gunn and gets solid support from a well-rounded cast. Tightly paced, the film bristles with action as Bogart and company take on Rommel's Afrika Corps., delivering the goods when it comes to pleasing the most demanding war movie buff. The film's black & white cinematography vividly captures the North African terrain with amazingly inventive skill.Blazing with taut, action-packed combat scenes, SAHARA is a film I highly recommend. It belongs in the true war film buff's film library."
5,Sahara,"I can't believe that this movie is not better known. Amazon suggested this movie and I got it as part of another purchase. It is well done and makes you feel like your there, isn't that what we want when we watch a movie.Bogie does a great job letting you feel the pain of making life and death decision. He gives you a sense of the humanity that can be a part of war.Jeff Howard"
5,Classic WWII Bogart and LuluBelle,"Terrific wartime drama about a tank unit and a handful of Allied soliders holding off a battalion of Africa Korps at a small well. Keen action sequences, naughty Germans, stoic Yanks and Brits and bring a canteen as this will make you thirsty. Plenty of classic Bogie lines, very nice cast and acting. Check it out."
4,Good war flick with Bogie,"I enjoyed this flick. Bogie is an American tank sargeant in WWII. The best part is Bogie's cynical stoic attitude, especially when dealing with the Brits. The story is paced well and even my wife enjoyed it. The battle scene at the end is a little hokey, the Germans of course get mowed down, but overall its a good flick and one I'd never seen before, even on the afternoon B&W flick channels. If you like war movies and Bogie, this is for you."
5,"Water,water, everywhere, and not a drop to drink","I have viewed this movie many times and still enjoy the drama. Bogart plays his role of Sgt. Joe Gunn(an appropriate name for a tanker)Dan & Bruce are pretty stereotype. The various allied troops they encounter along the way is interesting, particularly the Medic Captain, who realizes that Sgt. Gunn a very experienced soldier should be in-charge. I enjoyed the scene where the Free French soldier is describing his eating habits, some cheese,some bread, a little wine. This event keeps playing until Luigi interupts by asking for a little onion.A feast to be had. To me this movie is an epic, unfortunately, a remake featuring Jim Belusi(sic) as Sgt. Gunn is so awful it never should have been made."
3,Sahara,Not Bogey's best movie. It's alright just not the excitement that I was expecting. Check out Treasure of the Sierra Madre for a really great flick.
3,Sahara Review,The movie is fine but there are sections that are cut from the original and did not have to be since it is on disk and there are no time constraints. Other than that it is ok
3,"""Sahara"" is emblematic of its time","Anyone wishing to understand the American mindset in the middle of World War II would be hard pressed to do better than ""Sahara"". It successfully combines the elements of Allied unity against great odds and the willingness to sacrifice oneself for ultimate victory against Nazi tyranny.Paradoxically, the even-handed relationship between the caucasian British and American troops and a British Sudanese soldier in the movie flies in the face of the official segregation in the U.S. armed forces of the time.How good is ""Sahara""? Good enough to inspire a retiree who lives in my area to construct a full-scale, wooden replica of Bogart's tank Lulubelle in tribute to the film!"
3,Great classic-spotty mastering,"If you've never seen Sahara you're missing out on a great Bogey performance and all out terrific WWII movie. It has all the elements of a great classic: Solid characterizations, stirring action, an excellent story, and one of America's greatest stars. Sahara really gets moving in the second half and I was surprised how violent and realistic the fighting was. I was a little disappointed in the DVD transfer. While the contrast and clarity are excellent, there are several white specks that pop in and out of the image especially in the first half. I've seen many pictures from the 30's and 40's that are perfectly clean, so I'm surprised that this big boxoffice hit didn't look better. The mono soundtrack is in need of restoration also, as the music is brilliant. Someday this one will be back out in a totally remastered collectors edition. This is not it."
5,What? You haven't seen Sahara?,"If that is true, then you are missing one of the best war films ever made. Forget 'Saving Private Ryan'. For the cost of a couple of seats in a theater for that less than adequate flick, you can be moved by this simple gem over and over again. Bogart at his best, outstanding direction. Why can't they make them like this anymore?"
4,"Its got Bogey, what else need I say?","While this is a good story, there are a few problems in that the German Army was a lot more savvy than was shown in this film. Especially with Rommel's outfit. In real life the Germans would of quickly over run this outpost and with a lot fewer casualities. But hey this is a movie! So if you want to see a good WWII era war film then here you go."
5,SAHARA,"BOGART AT HIS BEST,WONDERFUL MOVIE,HISTORIC,ADVENTURESOME AND EXCITING.THERE IS A REMAKE WITH JAMES BELUCHI WHICH DOES NOT MEASURE UP TO THIS."
4,FLAWED PLOT DEVICE,Overall a good movie but a plot device stretches credibility. The possibility of shooting down a ftr with one shot from a 37mm anti-tank gun is nil. The writers were incredible lazy on this plot point.
4,Helpful.,It helped me through a difficult time. Can't say more because it was so long ago I don't remember it.
2,flimsy; not as shown,"Mine came different than shown. The flag panel was only in front, not divided as on the picture, nor extended around the side. A completely different look. The material is flimsy and the fabric print sloppy. Unless the novelty really appeals to you, take a pass on this; it's not worth $15"
1,This CD should be titled: THE WORST OF SASS,"Sass is no Britney. But, from this CD, you could hardly tell the difference. For Sass to lower herself to Britney's level of over-processed, un-soulful singing, blows me away! Sass had it all with Rats. She should go back to that genre. That's what the 30-somethings are aching for these days. Change isn't always for the better...uh, and what's with the dropped ""s""?"
3,Nothing is ever lost,"Maxwell's attempts to set up a Basking shark fishery based on what was then his island, Soay. The reader does not need to venture out into a small boat off the coast of Skye to get a feel for this experience. The writing lacks a little of the delicate wistfulness of the 'otter' books yet there is no doubting his style and beautifully descriptive prose. Being born into nobility was no guarantee of a successful life and it shows great tribute to the man that he was willing to get his hands dirty in this way. A lot of useful research on Basking sharks came from this venture and provides a rare window into an age that is past."
5,Well researched & well written,Martial artists with a desire to learn the history of Japanese bugei have appreciated Skoss and her insightful and informative writing for some time now. KORYU BUJUTSU deserves a spot next to Draeger's budo/bujutsu trilogy.
5,It finally all makes sense...,"Amazing insight contrary to most popular opinion. The exercise is an investment in time that pays off hundreds of fold. Better yet, the author is more than willing to take the exercise to the next level to really bring it all to life. One of the best investments I've made in years - in time and dollars!"
1,Terrible.,"I'm a huge shadow fan and I was hugely disappointed to find that this album is basically one long mixtape of obscure and, in my opinion, terrible west coast hip hop. I didn't think it was the real DJ Shadow until I heard an ad for The Privat Press at the very end of the CD. It could be that I'm an old school NY hip hop head and this just wasn't my style. It could be that the music on this CD is simply weak hip hop. All I know is I wish I could return it. Contact me if you want to buy it cheap."
4,Superband!,"The Sign consists of Terry Brock (lead vocals), Mark Mangold (ex ""Touch"", keyboards), Randy Jackson (ex ""Zebra"", guitar), Billy Greer (ex ""Kansas, bass) and Bobby Rondinelli (ex Rainbow, drums). This CD offers some great melodic pop-rock with excellent musicians, great ""hooks"" and fantastic vocals! Fans of Journey, Kansas and late 70's rock will love this."
2,Not up to par,"This book had a damaged cover and discolored pages. I sneezed as I read it. Also, the font was very small which put a strain on my eyes. If my book club had not selected it, I would not have read it."
2,Unrealistic yet funny...,"I too was required by Mercer to read this book for my freshman year... I personally thought it was very unrealistic and pointless (seeing I was supposed to read it for school, didn't figure out how this was supposed to help me in college)... The only positive thing I will give this book is that it was outright hilarious at times - so if you're reading it for pure pleasure, its a funny read.I do have one question, why is it called The Whisper of the River? Did anyone figure that out?"
5,Great Read,For those of us who went off to college in the South and pledged a fraternity it will bring back great memories. Even though I went to college in the 1990's I was still able to relate to some of the stories.
1,"Forced to read this worthless book over the summer, for school","I am a senior this year and had to read this worthless offensive book over the summer. For AP English...how about Macbeth, Shakespeare Aristotle ..... instead of this book!!Really this book turned me off and it would never had been bought or read by me if It wasnt mandated reading,I have found better reads on bathroom walls! Hated it!"
2,Okay,"This book was okay. It's really a boy telling his college experience at Mercer University in Macon, Georgia. It's interesting if you know anything about Macon. It wasn't one of those books that kept you reading, but it wasn't awful either."
3,Interesting,"This CD promises mantras for abundance. If you are accustomed to Thomas Ashley Farrand's lucid discussions and introductions you will not find them here. What you get is a CD containing very Eastern sounding chants, with a male and female voice. The accompaning booklet has a brief introductory section, followed by the verses of the chants, without the benefit of a pronunciation guide. There are also English translations of the chants. The authors claim that the mantras work without a formal discipline, although it is suggested that listening to them at dawn and/or dusk will increase their efficacy. Focusing on one's goal with a candle can also assist but is not necessary.I have not yet seen results and frankly, was a bit disappointed in the somber, dirge-like tone. Greater instruction would have been appreciated."
3,Annoying,"I have the whole set: abundance, fear, and healing. I haven't listened to healing yet, but abundance is ANNOYING and I got better results with the releasing fear one. Whenever I listen to the releasing fear one, parking spaces appear, people I think of show up, and overall things just go my way. I don't think the abundance one is very good."
2,Beautiful cd - no results,"I've listened to this cd for about 3 months, while also following a strict chanting discipline from Ashley-Farrand's abundance cd. The chants are beautifully done, but they haven't helped me. After 100 days, and no results, I'm putting this cd away."
4,and you thought all Cambridge Don's were just snobs,"This translation has a subtlety about it, I simply didnt' find eslewhere, I mean I like Leloup's transaltion enough to buy it, but didn't find any others appealing and rewarding enough to fork over the hard cash, but thisone struck a chord. Hugh 's approach is humane and poetic, but not lacking in the facts, and hard hitting disturbance you come to expect from a gospel; it's easy to see why it was included in earlier versions of christian canon, esp in Persia with Hugh's particular slant."
5,Other readings of early writings,"It has been a long time since I read this book, but I would recommend all the gospel books that have been published in the last few years to anyone interested in Bible literature."
5,Excelent Astology Book!,This book was wonderful!It gave great detalis about astrology without it being in the Zoidac/Astrolgical lanuge.It's easy for any one to understand.For beginers or older students of the craft alike.
4,Good book for beginners.,I am newly into astrology. This was a good book for newbies like me. Had good overall descriptions.
3,Reviewing Sevillanas,The instructor does not have a male partner so the man's part is never shown with the womans.The counting rythm marker is very hard to read on the backround (grey on white).The instructor describes the cultural and historical significance of the dance during the instruction. When you want to keep practicing one part you have to fast forward to get through the history lesson.Overall the insturctor breaks down the steps and is easy to understand.
3,Complete History.......not so much....,"Missing a few things like the sinking of Bismarck, a exciting story that is well documented by James Cameron's documentary.ALso no mention of Patton's reprimand and removal from Africa.This is also missing maps which make a documentary much more interesting.Instead you get Russion footage while the narrarator(sic) intones ""then tursk and blah and blah blah were re-taken by the Russions....""Still not bad for $20 bucks."
2,Highly disappointed,"I received the production this Christmas. I was very excited and thrilled when I opened it up. I love everything about WWII, until today.This is a Canadian production that should have been left on the cutting floor. The narration dialogue does no justice for the men and women who fought from all countries in this all encompassing war. At times I thought the script came from a junior high student; childish. At times the producers get the facts right while others they ignored the true events of history and wrote in their own thoughts. I'm not going to go into them for I would spend more time writing notes then watching the video while I'm sleeping.I am currently on disk three with seven more to go. I seriously doubt I will view them all. I have seen the same clips of Rommell, Patton, and Operation Uranus so many times I can't even count that high.This is a great work of fiction to say the least. Save your money for better produced works."
3,OK newsreel -style portrayal of WWII,"""WWII: The Complete History"" tells the story of WWII in a series of newsreel-style vignettes. No date of production is given in the box-set but the whole enterprise looks old-fashioned. The taglines for each item include gems such as ""The Scum Also Rises"" about the rise of the Nazis and ""French Fried"" regarding the fall of France. The American narrator has a whiney, smug voice and the commentary eschews objectivity. Much of the footage reappears again and again and the music is the in the dated style of the newsreel.Not terrible but WWII buffs will be disappointed."
2,"boring narrator, annoying format","If you are considering buying this set, I recommend that you get it from your library first, and check it out. It is cheap for a reason!"
4,Old but informative.,I like this series because it is informative. This is an old seriesbut the action of its day is good. It is a must if you are a WW II buffor you are trying to understand the when and whys of WW II. I recommendit if you can get it for a reasonable price. There are better seriesthat have more updated information but this dvd series is good.
4,Makes great gobbler sound,"My hunting buddies thought a gobbler was just outside the camp when I was using this call. It makes a very realistic gobble. I use it when a gobbler seems like he wont come into the decoys. If he hears another gobbler with a hen, then he should come running. I use a hen and Jake decoy, so having a gobbler sound with the hen yelps make for a realistic conversation. I really like this call!"
3,maybe,"Got this call late in the season and the turkeys were not very active,hens were already on the nest.But this call sounds like a tom with a hair ball. If you can get it on sale it is worth it."
3,Roger's First,This is Roger Waters first solo effort. It is a soundtrack from a movie and the songs are very wierd sounding. Some of them are pretty sick sounding (namely the song that would be the first song on side two of the album). The last song is pretty good though.
4,A Ron Geesin album,"I won't repeat what other reviewers have already said so eleqeuntly about this (a-hem) Ron Geesin album, but I will add that while this recording may be of limited appeal to those who do not dabble in experimental music, Floyd fans withstanding, it is a what I would call a musical box of tiny chocolates where some of them taste weird, but you are at least glad you tried it. My only disappointment with this album is that the tracks are just too short. There are dozens of moments where things sound brilliant, but with the exception of the three traditional length songs on here (Water numbers of course) every moment is fleeting. Maybe that is the point or maybe it is just because this was a soundtrack."
5,"Roger Waters & Ron Geesin - ""Music From The Body""","""Music From The Body"" takes you on a marvelous musical journey through twenty-two compositions. The Body was a medical documentary directed by Roy Battersby and produced by Tony Garnett in 1970. Sound experimentalist Ron Geesin collaborated with progressive-rocker Roger Waters to release this twisted auditory exploration of the human body. ""More Than Seven Dwarfs In Penis-Land"" and ""Mrs. Throat Goes Walking"" explore the bizarre world of vocal manipulations. In addition, members of Pink Floyd join the duo for the soundtrack finale ""Give Birth To A Smile""."
2,Another stale rock book,"For fans of Lou Reed only. For a real look at Lou get Growing Up in Public, his authorized autobiography. This book is just another stale rock review of who signed for how much with what record company."
4,One Helluva Book..,"Hilarious is one way to describe the cartoons in here.Especially the few ""Adam and Eve"" ones..but youd have to buy this book to understand what I mean by that.Heh.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I admit I didnt quite get atleast 5-7 or the cartoons.But thats only due to my ignorance in the subject that is joked about."
4,QUESTION,I love the Vivaldi Concerto in G. I would like to purchase it - however - Vivaldi wrote many concertos in G. Does anyone know which one this one is?
1,"Not Quite ""Every Note""","Every Note's edition of Beethoven's 15th Piano Sonata is readable and conveniently edited for faster learning, in a manner similar to Alfred's Piano Works editions. However, it does have a glaring flaw: it omits the entire 3rd movement."
2,Too soft.,"Won't buy this kind of product again online because it's too much of a pain to return it, but we found this to be too soft for us. Probably would be good on top of an ultra firm bed. I was actually using it to keep me away from my too hot memory foam mattress."
2,If you want a soft topper- this is not it.,"First, we live in a small town. I looked and looked for a topper in the nearest city (85 miles) with no luck so I had to purchase online. I purchased this topper to go over my memory foam mattress. I feel that the memory foam is too dense, therefore too hard. I read all the reviews and thought I would be happy with this topper. I was hoping to soften the feel of our mattress BUT this latex topper felt nearly the same as the mattress itself. I was so disappointed.Then to add to my disappointment- I am responsible to pay return shipping and a 15% restocking fee. I paid 298.00(incl. shipping) when I purchased this- I paid 71.00 for UPS return postage and 41.25 (approx.) restocking fee. In the end it cost me about 140.00 to try out this topper.Finally, my advice- don't buy unless you can try it out in a store."
1,Side Sleepers - Forget about this mattress,"This thing comes shipped hastily wrapped in saran wrap & thrown into a box. That's exactly how it is going back too (at my expense of course...).If you sleep on your side don't bother with this thing. I like a firm mattress (I've slept hundreds of nights on military cots). But in terms of comfort I'd probably take the military cot.This mattress pad compresses down very easy to maybe 1"" (I am 5'11"" and weigh 180lbs) and then this mattress pad stops - completely. Might as well be a piece of plywood under there as far as your hip will be able to notice. My mattress underneath is a Beauty Rest I just purchased last month for what it's worth. I thought it would be nice to add a non-heat latex pad to it for when it gets hot here in Dallas during the summer.Forget about this mattress pad if you sleep on your side. Maybe back and stomach sleepers the firmness doesn't matter but for my hip I'm not going to sleep on this thing one more night. It's going back."
4,Love it,I love this pad.. but a good web search finds other latex pads in more softness values and less expensive
5,Good to have Barron's Perspective Alongside Kaplan's,"This was a great slim volume to use alongside Kaplan's GRE Premier Program since they have slightly different hints and perspectives. Once you get oriented to the test, I would encourage you to start taking practice tests right away to see where you are at and it will inspire you to study more! You can always buy more tests because each GRE book has a number of them. I also highly recommend the Kaplan GRE Exam Vocabulary Flashcards Flip-O-Matic for learning vocab. Good luck on the test."
3,Pass Key to GRE,"This is the most basic of GRE review books. If that's all you need, then it's perfect. If you need more explanations of how to solve math problems then this is not the right book."
3,"Entertaining, fluffy, not too deep.","Perhaps it's because I'm reading it 20 years later, but I was not so impressed with this book, for all the reasons mentioned above. He admits it's a tourist's eye view of cultures which are far more complex. It is descriptive in an almost circumstantial kind of way, and not elevating at all, or much. I thought it was sweet that he kept in touch with so many of the people he met during his travels, and he seems to have a genuinely good heart. But I felt like he was poking fun at many of them, too. Read it for the snapshot of Asia in the late-80s that it is, and a very narrowly focused one at that."
1,patronizing fluff,"I tried reading this book while in Kathmandu, and forced myself to finish the chapter on said city before throwing the book across my hotel room in frustration. His anecdotes start out interesting, but turn into self-serving drivel that trivializes a very complex situation and culture. What bothers me most is that his writing is gimmicky- he puts words next to each other that try to sound cool and witty, rather than sharing any real insight. P>Predictably, the Thailand chapter concerned itself mainly with the sex trade. This a common theme, and it's sad that so many authors can't come up with anything else to say about a truly diverse and fascinating country."
3,"Great manufacturer, cheap China coil","I used this Mitsubishi/Dodge Neon DOHC Blaster coil for about a year, then my wife's car started a bad misfire. I put the oem coil back in, which was ober eight years old, and the misfire was gone. Called MSD and it was out of warranty and guess what, they replaced it anyways for me since these China made epoxy filled coils cannot be fixed. Great customer service and they stand behind their products."
4,Good,Almost new bookBom vendedor!Demorou um pouco pra chegar mas valeu esperar por mais alguns dias e ter um preo bom por um livro quase novo
1,Save your money,"I'm a hardcore Stout fan. This book was so disappointing. It was more about what the author wanted to include in it versus what might be of interest to a reader or fan. He has silly things like charts of how many people were killed, the manner in which they were killed, and where they were killed.Hardly worth $18 for the pb or the $30 for the hardback."
2,Not Bad But Needs Links Updated,"This CD has several good bits of info and thumbnails of evdience photos but virtually all the Web links to the National Archives and Records Administration are broken. A good portion of the CD depends on these links to provide much of the information advertised. In addition, much of the CD is simply a listing of items of evidence in related groups and NOT the actual documents, photos or reports.Unless you just want to collect all things ""Kennedy Assassination"" I would recommend bypassing this CD produced by the U. S. Government."
4,reamer is extremely sharp!!!!!,"This is a great kit but the reamer can possibly do more damage to a tire, especially if the correct puncture angle is not determined prior to reaming the hole. This will result in a tire that has to be patch or replaced, dependent upon how large the affected area is."
5,Dreamy bliss...,"I bought this album randomly without listening to it, and was very plesantly surprised at how great it was! The two CDs contain a variety of sounds - from dreamy and meandering to mellow, jazzy, downtempo and atmospheric, as well as just plain cool. Some of the best tracks are 'Hifi Love', 'Cylons in Love', 'Eple', and the seductive 'Nikita.' A great compliation!"
5,San Francisco:Authentic Recipes Celebrating Foods Of The World,Excellent layout...I really liked the Introduction section and the different food focuses in the Best of San Francisco.Then the recipes!!!Beautiful photos.Wish I had read this book before our recent visit to San Francisco but it captures so much of the flavours of this amazing city.This product is better than I could have imagined.
3,Not nearly as much fun as New Orleans book.,"Haven't yet tried any of the recipes .... for some reason the book seems ""dated"" , even the photographs seem out of date."
5,It does boost the immune system,"This product does boost the immune system. While this product will help, it needs to be part of a broader treatment plan. The diet the dog is on, treats, etc. all need to be taken into consideration. If you have a dog that has chronic symptoms, you need to deal with a vet, preferably and board certified homeopathy vet for treatment. My experience with this product deals with dog that was constantly getting sick, the local vet, two internists and even a top veterinary school has deemed this dog has a compromised immune system and eventually antibiotics will no longer work. The use of a homeopathy vet started her on remedies and transfer factor. So far so good, no antibiotics have been given since she started this new treatment."
1,canine 60,i have 5 dogs and all 5 didn<t like it I try putting it in can food & table food and it was no go.So a can of it just seating tfere.I hope you have better luck.
5,Excellent Immune Booster and Nutritional Supplement,"This product is excellent - it contains enourmous amounts of vitamins, minerals and the TRANSFER FACTOR formula which greatly boosts the immune system of my dog(s) in an expeditious manner, helping them fight deseases and maintain a healthy body. Thank you for your expeditious (free) DELIVERY!! the product arrived in only 2 days!! (and in excellent condition) -- I will definitely 'reorder' from this vendor (and this product) again, once the product is finished."
1,useless!!!,"This map only shows a small fraction of Phoenix, much less the Phoenix metro area. It is pathetic and useless."
5,Nutrizac,"Have used this product in the past and cannot get it in my area at this time. Glad Amazon.com carries it and it is terrific! All natural, no interference with my other meds and calms your nerves quickly."
4,some stories are wonderful and some are boring,Some of the stories are beautifully written like The Transformations of Cindy R. and The Magic Bow. M. E. Kerr's story is also along the lines of the other two. All of them are very enjoyabel except for the one about the horse. This book can really help girls dealing with life's problems.
4,This book can give you a big impact!,"I feel that by reading this book it has made me stronger. There was alot of differnt side stories that got kind of confusing. But I think over all it was a really good book. I don't see myself reading it again though. The book started with a story about this girl that lived her her mom and dad in a pretty ok neighborhood, exept for her family. The Dad was an alcoholic and the Mom wasnt much better so the girl had no one to turn to. One day the police came and took her parents away so she was forced to a new family... The book mostly talked about how she came to adjust to the new life style. This book really made me realize as the reader about whats going on in this world. A lot of people dont realize it because there familes arent bad, but I think this book was a really big eye opener!"
3,Works for me,"Something was eating the leaves of my plants. I couldn't figure out what it was.This product claimed that it would keep away small animals. That was enough for me to try it since my fence didn't work!While waiting to receive this, I saw we had a rabbit in the area again. We hadn't seen any in a few years (since the neighbors got a dog).When it arrived, I sprayed the urine around the perimeter of my fencing. The neighbors cat came by as I was doing it and quickly moved away as it really doesn't smell very good.Nothing has taken big chunks out of my leaves since."
4,Attaching in Adoption,Very clear simple book explaining the basic steps to adoption and how to deal with the parenting of a child from an unpleasant environment of growing up.
4,Comprehansive and Worthwhile,"I feel so fortunate to have read this book. It covered all of the attachment topics covered in my Foster/Adoption training, but in much more detail and with specific recommendations for at home bonding techniques. The book is very negative, however. I wish the author had provided more positive examples of successful treatment outcomes. Read this book in small bits and keep thinking to yourself that children are resilant. Good luck."
2,not very useful for infant adoption,"I am sure this is an excellent book for parents of children adopted when they were older, or parents who are currently going through attachment problems. However, I read this book as a prospective adoptive parent of a 6-month-old baby, and all it did was cause great anxiety and worry. I imagined all kinds of frightening scenarios. Also, there is hardly any advice to parents adopting infants. I would have been much better off waiting to purchase this book IF I needed it. For now, it's going on the bookshelf and I'll pull it out in the future only if we develop some sort of problem. I gained MUCH more useful advice on attachment from a brief insert I received in my Adoptive Families Magazine."
3,doom and gloom,"This book is listed as a ""must read"" for all adoptive parents but all it does is focus on the worst case scenario. Not all adoptions result in aattachment issues. Also, it offers no guidence regarding how to predict if your child will have these problems. What age is best to adopt? Are there any other factors to consider? None of these factors are addressed. It operates under the assumption that if you are adopting, you will have attachment issues to deal with."
5,Dark and Deadly!,"This is one of the finest collections of music I've heard in along time. This has great music by Cocteau Twins, Nico, and many more! If you love Art of Darkness, then you'll love this!"
4,Calming,"I found this album by chance at a used CD store. Brought it home, listend to it: along with my mother, and althought being the end of gen-X, we both enjoyed it! sure, we all want to be vampires, but this album is truely depressing. Lots o fun."
1,Poor quality,"I ordered the purse holder but was dissatisfied when the item I received was not of the quality represented in the photo. The crystal was murky and,pale. Very unlike the similar item I purchased from Stein Mart and misplaced. It was, however, just as expensive, and the crystal fell off before I ever used it. My husband tried gluing it back on - still haven't used it. Probably a garage sale item for a quarter. Don't make the same mistake."
3,"OK, but the foldable ones are better","Bought this for a friend's birthday, but wish I had just bought the foldable one for her instead. This doesn't come in a box like the foldable one and this is also larger and thus, bulkier. It's good if you don't want to pay the extra $8 or so for the nicer, foldable one."
2,Big Pink,"The hanger worked well, but I did not like the look of the pink stone. It looked cheap to me and was not faceted to make it sparkle."
2,Very Disappointing,I ordered several of these. The photo showed the stones glued in place -- but that was inaccurate. The stones were loose in the small plastic packing bags. No instructions or glue was supplied that would enable the purchaser to set them in the metal frame. I returned them.
2,"Beautiful, useful, but cheap","I was happy with my pushase, despite the high price, becouse I loved it, but before I coud use it the stone come unstuck. I still have it becouse I want to know if I can stick it. It's beautiful, so you could take the risk."
3,"too much biography, too little original critique","Very well written and very readable. Lots of interesting details about several European philosophers. Unfortunately, there isn't much beyond the biographical details. The ""afterword"" is the closest the book gets to a serious critique and an original contribution. (The philosopher bios are generally compiled from other biographers.)Also, the book is really a compilation of (revisions of) previously published essays by the same author, and it shows:there is not much that connects the chapters.Readers interested in short and readable summaries of the intellectual and political follies of some of the 20th century's better known German and French philosophers might still find this book valuable."
5,Worth buying just for the Afterword,"This is a wonderful, beautifully written book. Worth buying just for the Afterword about Plato's political meddling, ""The Lure of Syracuse."""
2,Needs help,"A bit disappointing. As a taco aficionada for the past 60 years, I can say this costume lacks spice. It needs more ""ingredients"", flashier fabrics and less foam. And toss the pairing with a sombrero. Add a ""cilantro"" hat, or a ""cheese topper""."
2,dixson grammar for esl teaching,This is great for its explanations and exercises. Are you selling the 1994 edition? Why not give us the year of publication?
5,Exactly what I was looking for!!,"Exactly the Beethoven sheet music I needed; I'm trying to replace sheet music, one piece at a time, because I lost all my music in a flood a couple years ago. Always a fun piece to play; great to have it back!!"
1,A Minus Star,"Seller is extremely unresponsive. Sent 2 emails asking about whereabouts of my order and did not hear back from them. After 3 phone calls and given 3 different shipping dates, I canceled my order after several weeks. Please read all the reviews and you will find out that I am not the only one that has had this type of experience with this seller."
5,ragamuffin...,this is an awesome book if you want to learn how to play the hammer dulcimer like rich mullins. i have no clue how to read music but i found it easy to read this book and learn how to play the hammer dulcimer. it only took me like 2-3 weeks of pratice and i could play the hammer dulcimer pretty good! i would definatily recomend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to play the hammer dulcimer.
2,good luck,This is a basic book describing how to play 4 string chords on the hammered dulcimer. A cd that should be included to learn by imitation is absent .
2,Didn't work for us,"Other reviews said that this was a quick easy way to learn to play so I bought it for my 14 year old son who plays percussion and wanted to expand to hammered dulcimer. He didn't get it. When I tried to help, and I play piano, I couldn't figure it out either. Maybe we are too bound by reading music but we didn't get it."
2,Cheap but,The products I used in europe were of better quality with much easier adjustment and more adjustments. Setting spring tension is difficult and I would recommend using goggles as the little spigot can fly all over the place. In one pack you get two hinges and this is not clear in the pictures etc.Door thickness is limited about 1 inch I thinks so some joinery may be required to fit to thicker doors. Plastic covers would be nice so clothes etc. cannot get caught in hinge - but covers can be made from wood.
2,Go for the regular version,"I was disappointed in this because of it's sheer size and lack of use. I guess I should've looked at the dimensions but it seemed larger in the picture. The dots are smaller than my 4 year old's foot and they slide around on the carpet so it doesn't really work well. Plus they're flimsy paper/film material and crease if bent. Overall, he played with this for about 2 minutes then never again. It was a sheer waste of money. A positive is, like the original version, it's a good way to teach about right/left foot/hand, and balance. Too bad, seemed good in theory."
1,Not what I expected,This book is not what I expected and I would not buy it or any other books like it. It maybe a good book for someone else.Thank you.
4,Ex-church of Christ,"I am ex-church of Christ, but I would still recommend this book for anyone interested in the Restoration movement. This book containts many things that the average Church of Christ person might not know. Alexander Campbell was a premillenialist. He thought that the union of Christians worldwide would bring about the millenium. He thought this could be done by unifying Christians around certain core principles that he thought were derived from the Bible.I often wonder if some of the bitterness the Church of Christ has towards what they call denominational Christianity came out of the era following Campbell when the union of Christians and the millenium did not occur. Who can say? Churches of Christ are no longer premillenial; their beliefs have changed over the years. I do want to say that I met many sincere Christians in the Church of Christ."
5,Warren Barfield just can't seem to go wrong! :) Awesome CD!,"I saw Warren at a marriage event (Love Worth Fighting For) he did with Kirk Cameron. He is so funny, clever, and TALENTED! His voice is so soulful and his songs have such good messages! Get this album! You won't be disappointed."
5,Excellent Customer Service,Poster was damaged in the mail. They immediately sent me a replacement one. Excellent communication and service! Thank you!
3,Helpful but decent,"Pat is a master for Irish/Celtic guitars and his thumbstyle playings are very unique. In this DVD, he teaches songs that are well-known to fans of Chet Atkins, Doc Watson or Merle Travis. The way he teaches is not bad, but he doesn't teach you the songs step-by-step in great detail. I wish he would emphasizes a method or a way to learn to fingerpick with any type of song. If you don't know anything about guitars, you have no idea what's going on. I guess what I'm trying to say is, he'll teach you to play songs his ways, and not really get you to learn to play those songs or thumbstyle in length. If you can learn from what you watch, then you'll learn something from this DVD. Otherwise, it's a waste of time and money."
5,A couple of songs does not a good album make but...,"...two songs on this CD, Takeyouthere AND Greatestlove, are quite simply OUTSTANDING and contributed to my 5 star rating. I haven't listened to the 30 second music clips, but they probably can't do these two songs justice. For you music lovers out there, check out the jamming piano melody that runs in the background of Greatestlove. In this song, the melody and Musiq express so much yearning for the Greatest Love and makes us singletons yearn, too. It is both romantic and sexy and qualifies as both a ""baby-making"" and wedding first dance song all in one. There are also other very good songs on the CD as well (Buddy, Teachme, Thequestions, Betterman, Lullaby). This CD tends to fall slightly more in the old-skool R&B; (rather than true neo-soul) tradition. Still, if you are a TRUE old skool R&B; OR neo-soul music aficionado, trust me: you will not be disappointed by this CD. Truly for the grown and sexy.~ Bonafide music lover"
4,Musiq brings the R&B,"Having tagged Musiq as a true talent after his first album and singles like ""Love"" and ""Half CrazY"", his second album tarnished that tag for me.But Luvanmusiq is re-emergence for me. I feel like Musiq got it right this time with musical production/harmonies, vocals and lyrics. He must ve spent the recording period for the album listening to sopranos wonders like Mariah and falsetto geni MJ and Maxwell. Great voice and song material put this one as a R&B;/Neo Soul keeper and great to heat up the nights with that special someone. Fav include Teach me, Lullaby, Take you there(after a few listens) and Greatest love (also after a few listens.)"
5,Love it,Great Cd. . . . . . . . . I love Musiq soulchild and always have. I decided to get all his CDs after I saw him in concert. I wanted them anyway just never took action.
5,Love it! Love it! Love it!,"I guess my title says it all. I really think Musiq did it this time. I have all 4 of his CDs and this one is right up there with his debut for me. On Luvanmusiq, I found that I enjoy the entire CD except for ""thequestions"" which is just a lil boring/sappy for my taste (sorry, lol).Anyway, on to what I love about this CD. Great Ballads! And really great uptempo grooves! It's really hard for me to pick favorites on this CD. I definitely think that as great as it starts off, it gets even better towards the end from Millionaire on...wow. I really hope he can follow this one up with something just as great.Fave tracks:Greatest LoveMillionaireTeach MeToday (I guess at some point you gotta do a ""wedding song"" huh? lol)Take You There - Ooh wee! I'll GO!!!Better ManDefinitely pick this CD up.Happy Listening!"
3,"Great voice and warm, romantic sentiment, but needs to improve his flow and STOP USING SAMPLES!!!!!!!!!!","As far as being a heartfelt, romantic balladier in this age of sex, drugs, violence, and non-commitment, Musiq stands tall, always keeping his music tender, monogamous, and PG-rated.Unfortunately that appeal is half-diminished not only by the fact that he uses way too many samples, but in many cases he tries to stay within the confines of the song that he's sampling. What I mean by that is that he either sings to the tune of the song he's using, which just makes the song boring, or he'll try to cram 20 words into a space that should only have 3 or 4, which really ruins his flow.I like his personality and the overall tone of his voice, but his singing skills need major polishing."
4,Lovin' It!,"Since I am a true Musiq fan, this cd didn't disappoint me in the least! I love his consistent lyrical content; the stories about love and life are so very relevant. The beats are nice to groove to and they capture his style that is so unique. Pick this one up; you'll agree that he's still the man."
4,In love,"This album is definitely for those who are in love. Luvanmuiq is true to its name and I wasn't left with any disappointments. The only thing is I wish he had included more dance grooves to the album. But over all, Musiq did a great job."
3,The Reason I hate buying Cd's...,"This is a prime example of the reason I hate buying cd's after only hearing a banging title track! The CD isn't bad, but me being the Musiq fan that I am...I'd have to say I was expecting alot more. I KNOW for a FACT the Musiq can do waaaay better than this because he has w/ previous albums, especially Soulstar. Buddy is like the only upbeat track on the whole album. Listening to it in its entirety put me to sleep! However, I must say he does have some really nice ballads on there like TEACHME,and Betterman."
3,Not too impressed,"I'm a HUGE Musiq fan, but I really wasn't impressed with this album. Unfortunately, it's more of the same...more of the same sound that everyone else in soul and R&B is regurgitating. I was hoping that Musiq would come out with something fresh, but not so. While tracks like ""Betterman"" and ""Today"" did catch my attention, they don't hold a finger to his previous hits ""Half Crazy"" and ""Don't Change."" I would say it's a good effort, but that out of tune vocal at 2:12 of ""Lullaby"" (track 11) voided that statement...overall...the album's alright."
5,Back for the first time,"To be honest, I had written off Musiq after Soulstar. I loved his first two albums and was sorely dissappointed with his junior effort. But that is why you have to give people a second chance. This album is probably is 2nd best album after the first one. I was dissappointed that Ja Rule was on the remix instead of De La Soul but luckily the remix is not on the album. I got my Cd from best buy which had the bonus tracks on the same cd. Definitely get the bonus tracks as they are bangers as well."
5,Fantastic @}->---,"Wow is this cd great or what??? I really love it. I too own his other work, but each cd keeps getting better. This doesn't have one bad song on it at all. I really love track 1, Buddy. I cannot stop playing that. The mellow Millionaire is good and also is Greatestlove. He is so talented and I think he's very underrated but for us fans, we got ourselves a brilliant cd. It went straight onto my iPod and now I can play it where-ever I am. I love it and it's a new favourite of mine."
3,Just ok.,I don't feel that this album shows any growth from Music. His others were much better. This just sounds like the same old same old. It is just ok. Nothing to write home about.
4,It took me a minute...,"Ever since Musiq's song ""Just Friends,"" I've always looked for that ONE song that would stamp the close-eyes-snap-fingers emotion in me. I liked his other albums, but no song beat ""Just Friends."" So, when I got this album, I'd lost hope in getting that song that I would connect to. It took me a minute to get into this album. It wasn't bad at all. I liked it. Musiq has a beautiful, soulful voice that softens the heart and gets my head nodding. I listened to the album about six or seven times and finally went for a long walk with this cd in my player. I got to ""Teachme"" and grinned from ear to ear. Finally, a song that is on the level of ""Just Friends."" Not only is the song wonderfully expressed, but it definitely is a song I can relate to. After I connected with ""Teachme,"" for some reason, the album got a thousand times better. I really like it now! ""Teachme"" is going to be my jam forever. Go Musiq!"
2,"Action, please","I once loved Gunn's novels so much I would read them like a prayer book. They were borrowed from a Scottish friend. So I ordered them all. Alas, I no longer want to read 20 pages of a salmon's progress and a boy watching it. The folk are now folkloric to me, not noble beings. The prose is more like poetry. This is not a bad thing. Maybe it is the mark of the times - I only know that I do not want to read a book with virtually no action, no dialogue, and a valorization of the lower class gathered at river's shores. So sad."
2,Disappointed after years of use,"My Wife and I have used Solaray Once Daily Multi-Vitamins for approximately 20 years. It has been the only multi-vitamin my Wife could take due to her severe allergy to any Soy products or even traces of Soy.Unfortunately, upon receipt of the recent order of the product the label revealed that it now contains Soy. The formula has been changed and my Wife no longer has a source of Soy-free vitamins. No announcement of the formula change was given..Sid Reese"
4,Energy!,"This product is truly a full, complete multivitamin. I've been taking this vitamin for 3 months and I have amazing energy throughout the day. My hair is thicker and nails are stronger. Plus you really only need one a day. I gave it 4 stars as I wish they could make a veggie capsule without gelatin."
2,Gave it a shot,"Its not doing much for me. Seems to be keeping me from sleeping but as far as energy, I get more from a couple of cups of coffee"

5,Very nice,"I had a similar watch (Wenger) that lasted many, many years. I was happy to find one that looked so much like it. Delivery was prompt and the watch is beautiful."
2,defective wenger watch,"When I opened this package and took out the watch, it was just what I wanted EXCEPT it wasn't working. I assumed it was a matter of a dead battery. When I finally had time to take it to a jeweler to inspect it, it was not a matter of a dead battery. The electronic response was almost nil even with a fresh battery.So, unfortunate as this watch was almost identical to a similar Wenger I had for several years (of which I had broken the stem.)Thankfully, Amazon took the watch back and offered a full refund. Yay, Amazon. Boo, Wenger."
1,Do not buy this watch,"I have gone through two of these watches in two years. The first one quit a year after I bought it. I was in Germany at the time and tried to get a new battery. Was told battery wasn't the problem. Hadn't saved receipt, warranty, etc...My bad. Bought another one (at Costco). It quit after 10 months. Took it to the jeweler for a new battery. Was told...it's not the battery. And guess what? Although this watch is stamped ""Swiss made"" on the case, and the box is clearly labeled ""Swiss made"" and the warranty clearly says ""Swiss made,"" inside the watch is stamped ""Made in China."" The jeweler told me he could tell immediately as the quality of the steel casing was very steel and poor compared to the real thing. Evidently to get a real ""Swiss made"" watch you need to pay a lot more than $100. Whether this is counterfeit or what I don't know. But I won't go there again. Disappointing."
3,My wife LOVES this watch,"My wife wanted something pretty AND durable. This watch has been perfect. It is durable, keeps great time and cleans up easily. Update: My wife went swimming in shallow water and moisture has appeared inside. The stem was in the proper in position and there are no cracks in the crystal. It must have penetrated the stem seal."
1,Swiss Army Dive Watch,"I love my new watch. I swim a lot and it gives me assuredness that it will still be working when I resurface. Only problem is that the band is one link too long, so it slips the the under side of my wrist."
2,too big,"Unless you have super wide and huge feet, these are going to be a bit too large for your shoes. I would reccomend finding some that are a bit slimmer."
3,"While a Classic, It has been replaced","This prayer book is good, but you should be aware that the Reform Movement has replaced it by publishing Mishkan T'Filah, which is a written in a more contemparary light."
4,A Nice Reform Prayer Book,"I have to say I am quite surprised how good of a prayerbook Gates of Prayer is. It was a little confusing at first about which side to open, even though it was Hebrew opening, it had English cover as well on the opposite side. So I wasn't sure. But currently I am testing out the Mishkan Tefilah. But when I get toward using Gates of Prayer regularly, I am sure I will be able to appreciate it alot more. If you like a prayer book that has some contemporary language, gives you wonderful readings and traditional prayers, then this book is definitely for you."
5,The Essence of Prayer,This is a spectacular book filled with the prayers we hold closest to our hearts and heritage. The prayers convey the intermost values and conditions of this wonderful religion. It can be used on a day to day basis to remind ourselves of how we should live by the laws and teachings of the Torah. I recommend this book to all who teach and believe in a Jewish way life.
3,Tire cover is ok.,"The tire cover is ok. It was a little too big for the tire, so there is extra room around the tire. Does the job I bought it for."
5,The B.A.R. :D,I gotz to give it up to u Pat :D You've been my boy since the Shelby Forest Click days. But to us $FC is dead and it's all about HCP!! Lets keep reppin that Bay area to the fullest whiteboy!! The B.A.R. :) :)
3,Doubt Me Now? Yes I Do,This album never lived up to the hype. It was just ok no where near Doubt Me Now. I didn't expect him to drop another classic but I thought he was gonna come out with a good album. This cd is not original at all he even uses a part 2 of a couple of his songs from his 1st album. And when he dropped this album I was like damn I think this is kinda what we can expect from Lil Wyte from now on. I think he'll drop average to bad albums from this point on. And if u don't believe me compare the cd's he's had since Doubt Me Now and you'll see that I'm right.
3,CHILDISH LYRICS RUBBED ME THE WRONG WAY!,"don't get me wrong ""LIL'WYTE"" can spit like there is no tomorrow! ""H.C.P"" also knows how to make muzik! but for me i needed a little more than that ,i needed some good lyrics that i could relate to and/or stay interested in.i mean tell me a good ""G"" horror story about the streetz!! spit some sociopolitical message!! or give me a good old smoken song!! thats what i need!! i don't need to here imature songs about pill poppin,acid,shroomz,me me me, & i most definetly don't want to be listening to imature NATIONALIST songs like ""U.S. SOLDIER BOY""(oooh lets be phony patriots & make up a song that sounds like we are supporting bush's oil war)!!!! MAYBE WHEN I WAS 16 YEARS OLD I WOULD HAVE ENJOYED THIS BRANLESS NONSENSE!!! but not at 26! i do think that when this cat gets older & starts spitt'n about important stuff !WATCH OUT! but for now LIL'WYTE has got to stop acting so LIL' & grow up a bit!ATLEAST LYRICLY."
1,Wow,"Any One of you cokeheads who rated this album higher than three stars should be lined up and shot with sniper rifles. This is why hip-hop will one day just die, people like ""LIL"" white just inspire more and more young suburban kids to try to become rappers, stop listening to this cokehead no talent bastard and listen to something else."
1,Think Twice,"I purchased this for my new PSP, as I fly overseas often, and wanted the longer battery life. However, this does not fit my PSP. It seems to be for another, larger model (maybe an earlier version of the PSP?). The unit does not sit properly in the cradle, so the contact does not touch. So the battery power is not accessible. In short, it's useless. Buy something else."
5,An excellent stainless cleaner,I own a large number of expensive stainless steel pots and pans and have tried many different brands of stainless steel cleaners. The Kuhn Rikon cleaner was recommend by a professional fiend in the culinary trade and since using it I would never change. The product is efficient yet does not scratch or mar the surfaces of the pots. The paste is think and when applied with a soft sponge lasts longer than most other cleaners. It is also gentle enough to clean stainless cutlery and the fronts of stainless appliances.
2,"Probably good for newbies, too light if you have exprience","Unfortunately I have to disagree with other reviewers. I didn't find this book particulary useful. Half the space is devoted to snapshots from Enterprise Manager and walking through its wizards. It is probably an OK book if you are completely new to SQL Server, but if you have a couple of years behind your back, don't waste money. Very little coverage of new features in SQL2000 (UDF's, INSTEAD OF triggers, Cascading DRI, Partitioned views, etc.) I was unpleasantly surprised that such weak book was produced by the same team of authors who wrote a real gem: ""SQL7 Performance Tuning Technical Reference"". Get back on track, guys!Michael Neymit, MCSE, MCDBA"
3,"Mouth-watering photography of stunning clothing detail, but lacking if full garment photos.","I'd classify this as a lovely coffee-table book, it has many luxurious detailed close-up pictures of garments, but I wish there were also pictures of the entire garment and diagrams on the pattern construction. It's not all that good of a book as a costuming resource, but worth having in a library for the pretty pictures. I certainly would not recommend paying full price for it."
4,"Fun, educational toy","I got this for my son for Christmas because he loves maps. It is very educational, giving lots of little facts on all the countries in the world. It's a great tool to use if you need information for a book report or other school project."
5,Excellent second series,"This second in the series of a grand saefaring story concentrates more on the personalities of the characters, now that James Onedin's shipping fleet is established in a small way. James is still fired with ambition to own one of the world's best sailing fleets but is now, with his partner and brother-in-law, concentrating on building a steamship line, still much of an unknown quantity in those days. James's adventures take him into danger in the Ottoman Empire, under fire in the Franco Prussian war,running the British blockade off Carolina during the American Civil War and being at odds with slaving ship owners. It's a terrific ""Boys Own"" adventure story and great for family viewing"
3,The Oneidin Line,"The acting is excellent. 5 star, but the quality of the DVD is moderate at best. I would rate this 5 star should they remastered the original."
3,Not for a beginner..,"I didn't care for this book when I first read it, mainly because I found it confusing and it was the first one on the subject I read. However, when I read some more basic books, I reread this one. I got a lot more out of it. This isn't a book you skim, do a little breathing, and expect huge change. You use this with other knowledge, and you can have a powerful experience."
3,Good but hard to understand,"tough to learn for beginners, nice but it seems like it's too complicated to understand. i must find a book to start with.I like this one but I must go back and find a book that's easier to comprehend. so that I may enjoy astral travel."
1,Utter Garbage,"This book is utter trash. The techniques described are confusing and hard to understand. You have to concentrate on so many things at once it becomes tiresome. Also there is no sort of description of WHAT you will feel as you project. I gave up until I found William Buhlman's ""Adventures beyond the body"" by only reading the narration and journal entries contained in the first 2 chapters I was able to begin the initial stages of projection WITHOUT all the nonsense. Throw this book in the trash if you were unfortunate enough to Purchase it. I wish i never had"
1,"I hate to add to the bad , but . .","I have to agree with the bad reviews. I have had this book for months, and it sits on my shelf, collecting dust. I had had some other Denning & Phillips' books, but they all kinda fit a catagory. The writing style is almost verbatim. The techniques in the book are very confusing, and misleading. Again, another book where, ""If it doesn't work, you are doing something wrong . . "" leave no room for error. I have been interested in astral projection for years, and I have quite a few books. But if you have the just chance of not buying this one, don't do it!Still searching for the truth . . ."
3,If you like to spend money...,I read the book and tried the techniques but I must say that they are really confusing and not that good. The example with shooting out a cloud of your stomach and then trying to form a human body with it is just too much for me. If you want to spend money and read this book then go ahead but I would not give it a high rating.
2,question Mark?,"I should have read this comment before i bought the book. Now is too late, i have it just to occupy my bookshelf.After fist few chapters, i was very doubtful of the techniques.The book is very questionable especially when you move to the middle part which makes no sense or too difficult to believe it will work."
5,A Great Start,"We used this book (along with Petswelcome and the Internet) to help find accommodations for ourselves and our rambunctious German Shepherd puppy during a move across country. It was extremely helpful in finding possible places to stay in cities that we were not familiar with. Of course, we called all of the places to confirm that they took pets, the rules and the extra fees, before making a decision on any one place. Each place we ended up at was pretty well described in the book and our dog loved his first road trip!"
3,Where's the Maps?,The main reason I purchased the book was because I wanted the Hotel locations show on road maps. There isn't a single map in the entire book. For some reason I assumed this aide would be included in the printed version. In larger cites this would be a great help as I try to avoid going out of my way when traveling to find a place to stay. Its basically an outdated printed version of the Web site. Great to have along if your travel plans change and you have no internet connection but of limited use if you do.
2,Dated Information,"I took this and another pet travel book on a cross country trip to my folks house with my dog. I found this to be the least useful, as many of the entries were wrong (it was a HoJo, not a Ramada as listed) and the information was wrong (there was a $10/night charge and the book didn't mention it). All in all I wasn't too impressed."
2,Decent gloves but not the best,"These gloves are pretty comfortable and durable. (Bought about a year ago). The only problem I have found is that the padding doesn't seem to be evenly distributed as compared to Everlast gloves like the Everlast Pro Style training gloves. (http://www.amazon.com/Everlast-Style-Training-Gloves-Black/dp/B000JF6LUE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=sporting-goods&qid=1280888443&sr=8-1). Because of this my hands and knuckles would get very sore. When I boxed with the everlast ones this did not happen. Therefore, I would recommend the everlast gloves instead."
3,Gloves made to last,God gloves that have lasted through many bouts and still look great. However the inside is a little small for the average hand.
2,Play Gloves,These gloves are small and over padded-If you have smaller hands and don't hit hard they would be ok.
4,Basic hooping at its best.,"This video is great for the true beginner. If you have done any hooping, I would suggest moving on to Volume Two. They repeat everything that was in video one and there are much more challenging moves. I flew threw Volume One. The quality of instruction and entertainment value was very high."
1,not user friendly,"i bought the entire 3 disc set as a beginning hooper. the women sure seem to be having fun but are really terrible teachers. they go way too fast and never give you a chance to practice with music or a routine. they seem to only be interested in showing you how great they are at it and cannot slow down enough to give decent instruction. also, the disc is menu is very limited so you have to watch the whole thing to review what you need to see again. urgh! save your money and watch some youtube videos for free."
2,Cheap disc?,"I haven't been able to watch this much because the DVD won't play in my normal (otherwise functioning) DVD player. It will play on my computer's DVD player, but without sound. The DVD will play fine on my laptop, but that's not a screen that's very conducive to practicing in front of. The DVD does play on my friend's DVD player for some reason. Also, I bought volumes 1 and 2 and both are so short, it seems obvious that they could have put all of the lessons on one DVD. I guess they knew they could make more money by making us buy both."
5,Best Version of Wind In The Willows,"Ever since I sat down with my family back in 1983 and watched the very first episode on Aussie ABC, we fell in love, just waiting for the next installments to appear at 4.30pm every week. This Cosgrove / Hall version has to be at the top of the heap. Two thumbs up to the producers, directors, animators, and voice actors."
5,Classic tales of Imperial China,"Judge Dee is in a class with Sherlock Holmes, Nero Wolfe, and Hercule Poirot. Van Gulik was a European diplomat who spent many years in China; he started writing about Judge Dee when he translated a traditional tale of that sage official and then decided to write original Judge Dee tales."
5,Great Mysteries,Love these books! Always entertaining and enlightening about Chinese history. Smart and interesting. I plan to read them all and pass along to friends.
4,Favorite group of short stories,"I enjoyed becoming reacquainted with Judge Dee in this collection of short stories. I am fascinated by this time period all over the world, and China is no exception. Judge Dee is a very human fellow, with strengths and weaknesses and, though he is smart and observant, I never get the impression he's superior. Just ready to observe, analyze, and draw conclusions.Gulik is kind enough to give a chronology at the end of this book, too, which I heartily appreciated.I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in historical detective stories."
4,Tony Martin is singing on this one too!!,"Misha Calvin might not be the world's most known guitar player but he can sure handle the six string and this album from 1993 is very good. Tony Martin (Black Sabbath, Rondinelli, Empire, Mollo/Martin) is the singer on most of the songs. It's melodic hard rock/heavy metal of very high quality and the singing as well as the song writing is so good. Just listen to ""Stranger"", ""Ready or not"", ""Put a little faith in me"" and ""Reaper"" and you'll see that this album can compete with almost anything in the line of melodic heavy metal. But please, be careful if you stumble upon the follow up album (can't recall its title) and think you've hit jackpot, because it is absolutely nothing in comparison to ""Evolution"". On the follow up album, Tony Martin is no longer the singer - I found it, heard it and sold it."
4,Real common-sense etiquette,"This delightful book written by NAT SEGALOFF is a wonderful common-sense look at modern etiquette. Though Segaloff is better known for his entertainment field pieces, his wit and humor come shining through in this work. Enjoyable reading and chuckles throughout."
1,dodgy covers,"after purchasing this cd, i was really not that happy with it. after purchasing another cd by academy street records a few years ago, i thought the standard would be about the same. the vocals on this cd were dodgy to say the least, very little real grunt behind of the lot of the tracks. the most tragic and insipid song on the cd was by far the vocals by baccara on 'wind beneath my winds'....not a particularly difficult song to cover, but these girls have the most skinny thin, weak and wonky vocals i've ever heard. the arrangement could have been done so much better. also 'living on a prayer' by hazell dean....sounds like karaoke at the pub....honey, sit down before you hurt youself!!i can't believe that another volume in this series was on amazon.com recently secondhand for over $100......why would you bother????"
5,Excellent,Very meaningful personal testimony to a most important event in our Nation's history.Should be read by everyone.
3,Step inside a high-profile news story.,"TV news covered the Columbia breakup relentlessly, yet we haven't heard much from the families of the astronauts involved. This book fills the void by retelling the Husband's marriage and family life. It's a bit narrow in its scope - it's really not about NASA or the space shuttle program but only about Rick Husband's personal life as told by his wife."
3,Overemphasizes the religious aspects of this hero,"Although I enjoyed this book, it became tedious because of the overwhelming emphasis on Rick's religious beliefs. The book is co-authored by the astronaut's wife, who is evidently very comforted by her religion. Nearly every statement attributed to Rick, whether it mentioned his wife, his children, his family members, or his close friends -- incorporated his religious beliefs. I was more impressed with Rick's determination, skill, leadership qualities, and his desire to do the best he could in whatever he undertook -- which happened to include becoming a test pilot and astronaut, as well as a husband and family man. Don't get me wrong. Our American astronauts are my heroes. Rick Husband was heroic even before his tragic death. A more balanced picture of Rick would have been preferable. The saddest part of the story is that it took the loss of Columbia before most of the world learned how incredibly special the crew was."
4,Pretty good book,"The book High Calling is good. I recommend that if you enjoy real life novels you buy this book. It is about the astronaut Rick Husband and his wife Evelyn Husband. I liked it for that reason. Also, it gets to the point without too much detail but it has enough. It was also interesting how it told about all of the procedures that astronauts do and how their lives are. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes books about real people in real situations. Another good thing is that the book is spiritual and tells people who read it to become more spiritual."
3,Good to start,"It is good to start but not good enough to become an expert. Please buy ""The Vocabulary Builder"" by Charles Armstrong vide[...] to become a maven. You may supplement it with Michael Williams [...]"
2,hmmm,"When i ordered this product. i made sure that it was suppost to fit. i did the ""does this product fit your vehile"". well today June 4th i went to install it, and it did not fit. I'm not saying that i will return it. I guess im just going to have to weld it on"
3,Good Quality. Too Small and soft for firm support,"I am new to Yoga so when I found this likely I bought the wrong item. However if you need a 4 "" x 4"" x 6"" (Approx size) soft yoga pillow go for it. I later bought a yoga blanket that, when folded correctly seems to meet all my various yoga (begining) need.Good Quality and Well Made. Nice prices. Just wrong product for my needs/"
4,monitor,"This is a nice little monitor. It is easy to use and cofortable to operate. It runs about 10 to 12 points lower than an arm band monitor. If you keep that in mind when using it, you will be in the ball park."
3,Writst Blood Pressure Monitor,Omron HEM-650 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with APS (Advanced Positioning Sensor) This monitor was not what I was looking for my 86 year old mother. She has a hard time raising her arm up to her shoulder and this monitor seems to require it or it does not work. This is not good for seniors with arthritis or shoulder pain.
2,too difficult to use,"I purchased this device for my dental practice; patients come to dentists more often than their physician, and we have a better chance of uncovering certain physical problems. I can use it fine on myself, but placing it correctly on the patient and moving their arm to the correct position rarely works. And that, of course, creates a certain concern in the patient's mind."
1,Omron HEM-650 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with APS,"Disappointed in the product. I purchased the unit for my elderly mother and she could not get the automatic heart leveling sensor to work; which, of course, made the unit non-functional. We both tried several times with no sucess. Additionally, we took the unit to the doctor's office to ensure it was calibrated with their BP readings and couldn't make it work there either. I believe Omron is a quality company, in general. But, they need to get the bugs out of this technology. Buy the unit without the sensor and you'll be happier and less frustrated."
1,UNRELIABLE,I purcheased this unit after reading other reviews. It mostly had pretty good reviews.Butthis unit consistantly gives readings 16 - 20 points lower than actual pressures measered by profesional automatic machine and byparamedics.Can not trust it and will return it
1,Did not work for me,I had great hopes that this monitor would be accurate but it was not. I was able to get it to give me a reading right away but it is consistently 20 pts lower than my bp at the doctor's office.
5,Functional,"This product does what it is supposed to do -- inexpensive, easy to figure out and to use. Money well-spent."
5,Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,"WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT, easy to use and effective with the advanced positioning sensor. Just put it on the wrist, turn it on, position as instructed and bingo, blood pressure and pulse are taken."
4,good,"I bought it after reading all the reviews for this model and some others. Mine so far works well, measures presssure quite accurately and the price was right."
5,Works Like a Charm,"I've had this BP monitor for a couple of years now and have had it checked for accuracy at the doctors office twice, May being the most recent. The monitor was dead on both times. The battery life is great, the test time is short and it's comfortable on the wrist. The A.P.S. system works fine for me but I have heard of people having trouble with it but you can turn the A.P.S. off. Well worth the money."
4,Better than expected,"I purchased this one to keep track of husband's BP. He was told this was a good brand but we had not tried a wrist cuff before. We are both very happy with this product as it seems to be right on with both of our BPs. Mine is always low and this monitor has always shown about my normal, while my husband's is a little higher than mine and his showed about his normal also. We would totally purchase this one again!"
1,CHINA,"This blood pressure monitor was accurate (that is why I gave it one star) but it quit working after only six months. With the hassle of having to pay for return postage, then having to re-package it, drive all the way to the post office, and finally wait in line, I just chose to just chuck it.My time is worth money and my money is worth time."
2,Too frustrating,"When I bought this product I was relieved that I would finally have a blood pressure cuff to help take assessments on the unit I work on. In a nursing home, having a portable wrist cuff is a must in order to assess patients and give medications safely. I tested the cuff on myself before I ever tested it on anyone else. When I tried using it on patients, I found it more and more difficult to get a reading. This machine was so touchy that it wouldn't even start unless in the EXACT position, which was completely frustrating. after trying it on 3 more patients, and myself again, it still wouldn't register to begin taking a reading. I completely gave up using it and sent it back. Its a great machine when it works, but I wouldnt suggest this particular model to anyone."
2,Inconsistant Readings,"I purchased the Omron HEM-650, because my doctor advised me to keep a daily account of my blood pressure. I have found that the numbers vary so widely from day to day that I do not really take them seriously. Since I do not have confidence that the readings are accurate, I do not test as often as recommended. I will be less likely to take action when I get a very abnormal reading. It is not really worth the price."
4,OMRON HEM-650 wrist blood pressure monitor,"Well constructed, compact, easily carried in lab coat pocket. Takes getting used to and has a short learning curve but once mastered it is easy to use. Gives accurate measurements every time when compared with conventional monitors. Very useful at doctor's office or at home. Great value for the price when purchased at Amazon."
4,home helper,I like this BP monitor. It is easy to use and giving correct numbers to you. I would like to recommend this product to any person with high BP.
2,Not reliable.,I am a Hospice Nurse on the field. This product is not reliable on the field. I have had to manually take BP because of inaccurate reading of this machine. It does not take good reading of abnormal(high/low) BP. I would buy something else.
2,A difficult choice,"I did like this product very much, the way it fit, the way it worked, I was very satisfied the first day.Unfortunately the second it refused to inflate, and that was that.I returned it for a refund, even though I would have loved to keep it in proper working order."
4,very nice!,I bought this for my father. He said it is very convenient but not as accurate as the traditiional blood pressure monitor-which I think is normal for wrist bloodpressure monitor. he always measure a few times and get th average.
1,Horrible,"I couldn't get it to work. I am a very busy nurse and did not take the time to return it. I through it away. $70 down the drain.Donna Bronson, RN"
4,Good design,"Checking blood pressure at grocery story or pharmacy or at Doctor's office is not alway that convinent. So, I bought this little gadget. I am amazed how easy it is to use. I like the automatic start featuer. It start measuring after sensing you have placed your arm in the right place.I have not calibrated it with Doctor's finding, however, I'll take the device to Doctor's office and make sure what this little thing tells me is correct."
5,Awesome,This item is a lot better than the previous omron that I have. No guessing on how high or how low I should position my wrist to my chest. This one gives me an accurate reading so far.
1,COULDN'T GET IT TO WORK - RETURNED IT,"i bought this one because i read a review of ALL wrist bp monitors and this one was the top rated.i followed directions, but it didn't respond as stated. gave up trying to set date/time, and proceeded to take bp. the APS was troublesome. after several tries, couldn't get it in ""correct"" position, so it would not inflate. i returned it and ordered the HEM 629. hopefully, that one will work."
2,Inaccurate,I bought this because it is more convenient than the arm band ones when wearing a long sleeve shirt. The reviews I read where pretty good.I have used it for a few weeks and the measurements are all over the place.I compared it to the doctors office and it is really high and not consistent.It was a waist of money!
2,Wrist type pressure monitor not very accurate,"I knew before buying that the wrist type blood pressure monitor was not going to be as accurate as the arm type, however it is worse than I thought. I would not recommend this type as you can not depend on the readings. Go for the arm type, the wrist type definitely is very inaccurate."
1,MUY INEXACTO,"ME TOMO LA TENSION TRES VECES Y HASTA CUATRO Y SIEMPRE DA DIFERENTE, MALA PRECISION, MI HERMANO TIENE UN PANASONIC Y SIEMPRE LE DA LA MISMA MEDICIÓN ES MAS PRECISO"
2,Omron HEM-650 - Cross Your Heart and Hope to Die!,"This machine has a sensor determining when your wrist is on a level with your heart, which is not a necessity on any blood pressure machine.There is not even one inch of leeway - if your left hand is not precisely to the right of your heart it will beep angrily.And you have no idea what to do."
4,Excellent Monitor,At first I thought this monitor would be too complicated to operate. How mistaken I was. This is an excellent product with a simple ease of operation.
3,If Only it was Accurate,"I found this product very easy to use. Have no trouble finding the right position to get it going, and the display is easy to read. Great portability too. Unfortunately, it is not accurate. The readings are way too low. Once I got used to this, I started adding 10 points to the systolic reading every time and I feel that I'm getting closer to accurate doing that. Once you get used to how your particular unit works, you can at least know if your bp is running high or not. If it was giving me accurate readings, I would definitely give it a rating of 5, but this is a fairly important failing."
3,Readings are somewhat inconsistent,"I recently bought this portable unit through Amazon. It arrived within 3 business days. I also have a Omron Automatic BP monitor, model HEM-712c. I have been comparing results between the two units and have noticed that the wrist BP monitor consistently read lower on the systolic and higher on the diastolic when compared to the HEM-712c results. The heart rate also runs higher. I always checked my blood pressure within 5 mins of my initial reading. I'm not sure if the difference is naturally due to location of the pressure point being measured. Would I recommend this unit? Probably not as a primary BP monitor. Collect more data so you can have a better idea how much bias the unit has when compared to more accurate monitors. You will have a better indicator of what your BP really is when using this unit."
1,Garbage,"Purchased one and it worked two times before I got an error code that signified ""Abnormal unit function. Repair service required."" Sent it back for an exchange and the new one worked once before I got the same error code. Sent it back."
2,Not very accurate,I LOVE the idea of this product and the price is very good. While the monitor is convenient and easy to use it doesn't appear to be very accurate. My husband compared the readings between a regular cuff monitor (which he had previously found in agreement with his doctor's cuff monitor) and this wrist blood pressure monitor. There was quite a discrepancy. I am returning it.
3,Omron HEM-650 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with APS (Advanced Positioning Sensor),I like the unit...but sometimes people had trouble finding the correct spot to hold it before engaging
1,Doesnt work if you are overweight,This blood pressure monitor only works if you are a thin or average person. For someone who needs to monitor their blood pressure who is even slightly over weight it will not work. Strongly advise those who are NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.
5,easy to use,"Before I bought the Omron HEM-650 blood pressure monitor, I used another model from Omron, one with a manual pump, which I found very difficult to work by myself. Now, with this automatic device, I do not need a second person to measure my blood pressure easily and correctly. This is a very good product for a reasonable price."
4,Very convenient,"The HEM-650 is very convenient because you don't have to take clothing off to reach a bare upper arm. It does take some experience to get a reading, however. With a pressure cuff and stethoscope you can get an accurate reading on almost anyone, not this device. Frequently it takes a while to get it to start to register as you raise and lower the patient's wrist to a level the monitor accepts. I also found it just won't start on some thick wrists. With most people it works fine."
3,good for what it is,"Its very simple, straightforward and easy to use. I've given it several to older relatives and no one has had any problems using it.The only caveat, as with most digital blood pressure monitors, its not quite as accurate as regular analog ones."
2,Not worth the money,"This item is easy to use. I used it once and it worked fine. The second time I used it, it wouldn't register at all. Not matter what adjustments I made, it simply wouldn't register. I kept getting an error message. I went through the manual, readjusted as instructed etc. Nothing. It was worthless. When I went to package it for return, I dropped it and it fell completely apart. Would not recommend this item."
3,battery cover,"it functions properly, but cover of battery compartment is somewhat loose, seems to be poor quality.we bought in total 5 units. all have the same problem."
4,What's my Pressure?,"I presumed was following the instructions correctly, but I was not getting a reading. I called the company and a very nice lady was very helpful. You must grab your right shoulder with your left hand, then you get a reading."
2,Unhappy,Blood pressure monitor reads consistently low.Compared to others including my Cardiologist. He recommended sending it back...................Called company and they said to reset monitor which I did but still reads low by at least 10 points.Wish I could get refund but seems like its to late.
3,It is accurate,The APS sensor was clumsey and we disadled it. Unit is much easier to use and is just as accurate
4,Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor bought at Amazon,"I was reluctant to purchase a wrist blood pressure monitor because I thought they might not be as accurate. But, I couldn't use my arm because of an injury I had suffered. Thus, I decided to give it a try. I bought the Omron HEM-650. I must tell you that I was pleasntly surprised with the ease of use. You place the cuff on your wrist, press a button and voila! the monitor does the rest. Granted, that my previous arm monitor was manual and thus a bit more trublesome. Many times I thought that the effort, I used on pummping, may have altered the resultant blood pressure, although slightly.I am very happy with my purchase."
1,wrist blood pressure,i think that the monitor show a low blood pressure and i wnat to know if exist a proper way to calibrate this deviceOmron HEM-650 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with APS (Advanced Positioning Sensor)
2,"Works fine, but it's semi-worthless imho","The problem is that I have upper-arm monitors, two of them, and this wrist model is consistently 10-12 points too optimistic on the high end. That would be okay, if you knew that, and just added the points to get a ""correct"" reading, but do not rely on this for your only monitor, because you would be fooling yourself, and what's the point of that?"
3,Just OK,I purchased this for my 87 yr old mother. It was inconsitant with the readings and was too difficult for her to operate. The person using this monitor should have a sharp mind and steady hand. I did like the memory feature.
4,"got it for my dad, works really well","pros: very accurate measurement, takes AAA batteries so its easy to use in any country as the power adapters are not needed.cons: since it has positioning sensor it could be a little annoying, but that being said, it is present for a good reason, it avoids giving inaccurate measurment if the wrist is not positioned right."
5,"Accurate, painless blood pressure monitoring","This Omron A.P.S. HEM-650 is just what I needed. For whatever reason, blood pressure arm cuffs are very painful for me, and produce a very high blood pressure and pulse reading because of the intense pain I feel in my arm under the cuff when it is inflated (nearly unbearable). I bought this wrist monitor six months ago, and began recording my blood pressure readings, which showed normal blood pressure levels. Then I took it to my doctor's office, where the nurse tested it on herself and then compared it to her blood pressure using their arm cuff. The comparison showed the wrist monitor reading was the same as the arm cuff reading. My doctor approved the wrist monitor for my use, agreeing it gives an accurate reading. The wrist monitor records the date and time of each reading, and has a memory function so you can compare your current reading to your history of readings by pressing the memory button for each previous reading."
5,Great product,"As an RN with high blood pressure, I monitor my BP 4 times daily. After wearing out my other cuff, I purchased this product. It's wonderful. There is absolutely NO effort or skill involved if you need to take your own blood pressure. Love it!"
3,Omron Blood Pressure Monitor,"The original version of this blood pressure monitor I have at my office for my patients and my own use. It seemed to work okay. So I got one for home. But that was about a year or more later. By then they had ""improved"" it. Which sometimes means that they over engineered it and complicated it and in this case, may have ruined it. So the one at home is very tempermental to use properly and I keep getting error messages if I don't hold my arm ""just so"" during the testing action. So overall I am not pleased with this later version, when the simpler version worked just fine at my office. Sometimes manufacturers just can't leave well enough alone. So they have to ""improve it"". Lots of products are touted as "" new and improved"". Why can't you people just let things be ??!!"
1,Can not be relied upon for accurate BP readings,"I gave this product 1 star because it simply can not be relied upon. If you are watching your BP, you need to have an accurate reading. I have been using the Omron HEM-711 arm cuff for years, and verified its readings while in my Dr's office, and it is very accurate. I bought this wrist cuff because I thought it would be more portable, but was very disappointed in the accuracy.The SYS reading was a much as 15 to 20 points below, and the DIA was around 10 points below what the arm cuff was telling me. The pulse reading was right on. The wrist cuff will not inflate until it is in the correct position relative to your heart, so I know I was wearing it correctly and had it positioned correctly.This is completely unacceptable and downright dangerous if you're trying to keep a eye on your BP."
1,Not accurate,"This monitor is not accurate at all. We have tried it several times, on two different people. Every time the readings came out too low, sometimes ridiculously low."
1,Not delivered,I didnot get the item for more than 25 days afte purchase and have to ask Refund from Amazon which was propmt.
2,disappointed,"WHEN USING THIS MONITOR, IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND THE EXACTLY CORRECT SPOT FOR IT TO FUNCTION.ALSO, AMAZON TOOK OUR ORDER AND NEGLECTED TO MENTION THAT DELIVERY COULD TAKE WEEKS, ALTHOUGH, IT WAS IN STOCK.I HAVE A MASTER DEGREE, PLUS, AND THIS OMRON RESPONDS ONLY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY."
3,Accurate?,"I have a Microlife desktop model that I bought at Costco. The OMRON and the desktop are usually within a few points Systolic and Diastolic and on mark for pulse. The OMRON locks up when you try to use it for more than a couple of readings in short succession. Also, it seems to give inordinately low readings at times. It is very sensitive to positioning relative to heart level but I think it also is VERY sensitive to wrist positioning. The Beep to help in positioning is almost inaudible unless you are in a very quiet space. Good product for mobility but I would also have am arm cuff model to check accuracy."
1,Too hard to use,No stars for this. It is impossible to use if you have arthritis or and implant in your elbow and can't rasie your arm up to heart height.
2,Not Enchanted,"Worked ok for first couple of weeks. I think i am going to have to return it. That positioning sensor is very difficult to get just right. I'm disapointed, I delibertly shopped for Omron because I have other Omron products and they work just fine.Zondra Brownlee"
2,not reliable,"Service was great, product design very nice, but it consistently measured 10 to 12 points below the doctor's office, so I returned it."
5,Inexpensive and Accurate,"This unit is very easy to set up and use. I took it with me to a physical, and verified its accuracy. For the price it's hard to beat, and of course it arrived quickly."
3,I sent it back.,I was not impresssed withthis at all. I sent it back as everything was inconsistant from time to time and I needed it to be accurate everytime.
5,THIS WORKS GREAT AND EASY TO USE,I have had this a few months now and use it every day. Still using the same batteries which I had expected to need changing a lot because of the pump. Definitely an advantage over the older models I had.
5,Easy and fast to us,I'm an old retired RN -- hard to please for medical equipment. This BP machine is outstanding. How convenient to check BP at wrist. And so easy to use.
3,Omron blood pressure monitor HEM-650,"My old monitor stopped working, and I thought this was a replacement model. (I don't know the model of the original one.) This one lacks some of the features of the old one, which I liked and used frequently. This one is OK, but more difficult to program than the old one, and is not quite so handy. It is accurate, and I will keep it. I am going to try to find an exact replica of the old one, though, if it is still available.The monitor arrived promptly and in good condition, and was at about half the price than I expected to pay."
1,I want my money back.,"My experience with this unit-- The positioning indicator is tricky to use and works inconsistently. Positioning it on the wrist in exactly the same way gets different responses with each attempt.As to BP readings consistency, it is wildly different than my Omron home unit or the one in my doctor's office.As a result: it is useless.Unfortunately, the Amazon return window is passed. And, Omron wants me to pay to send this useless device to them so they can look at it.What I want is: my money back."
5,Review of Omron 650 Blood Pressure Monitor,Excellent product.Accurate. Easy to use. Records BP with date and time. Recommended it to a friend. Lowest price found for SAME item.
4,turn off all the *&^%$ stuff and you got a great BP monitor,"Omron HEM-650 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with APS (Advanced Positioning Sensor)After I figured out how to turn off ALL the extra ""stuff"" and got just what I wanted..a GOOD monitor to read blood pressure at work, at home ..wherever! And keep a digital record. Small and easy to use, stuff it in your purse or bookbag.... There are lots of older folks out there like me who go to their primary care physician and get nervous and have higher that normal blood pressure readings. This way, with this machine, I can have documented proof of normal BPs. Good job OMRON!"
5,Handy & Accurate,"The Omron unit is accurate and very portable. I take it with me while traveling and use it several times a day to develop base-line data. With research, I suspected some of my dietary supplements were increasing my blood pressure. By eliminating these supplements, I have seen a marked improvement in my blood pressure and the Omron monitor makes it easy to track and trend."
1,not accurate,"tried the product on 3 subjects, various ages, weight. Carefully checked correct positioning. All the time readings were 20-30 points below reality. Maybe we have a defective item? Cannot understand how so many people are happy with the readings...I would never buy a wrist BP monitor unless I could try it first... Nice and convenient model, but completely useless, based on my experience. BUYERS BEWARE"
1,There are much better products out there,"This item (Omron HEM-650) is difficult to use. It has to be lined up just right in a certain location near the heart and the elbow held in place with your other hand, to avoid movement. In that odd position it's no wonder you have to hold on. In my view this device is definitely not designed with people in mind, especially older folks. This is not a simple strap on and start device, as most others are. For that reason alone I would not rate it with any stars at all, if given that option."
1,Erratic...and unacceptable,"This product is totally unsatisfactory as a health monitoring aid. The results are erratic and not reproducible. It gives WIDELY different readings on left and right wrists (Yes, I changed the calibration as directed.). It does not agree even ""in the ballpark"" with an automatic arm cuff model OR a manual cuff/stethoscope. The much-vaunted APS system is a joke, inflating and registering only at crotch-level when on the right wrist!?! Steer clear of this product; mine was returned after a very frustrating afternoon of trying to get it to do ANYTHING in a repeatable fashion."
1,what is wrong with this thing.,it always shows wrong readings.for example my BP was 97-152 and it was showing 75-118. i never got any even near by readings from this device.ORmy device is kaput.
5,"WORKS LIKE THE DR,S OFFICE ONE","CHECKED AGAINST DR.'S OFFICE READINGS. SAME. A REALLY MUST FOR ANY HOME.. ESPECIALLY IF YOU FEEL WEEK OR ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR HEART RATE. ALSO GOOD FOR KNOWING WHEN TO TAKE A NEEDED BREAK. CEATAINLY DON'T PLAY DOCTOR, BUT WILL HELP YOU BE AWARE OF PROBLEMS. EASY TO USE AND UNDERSTAND. BE ABSOLUTELY SURE YOU KEEP THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL IN THE CASE TO REVIEW AT EACH TEST A REALLY GOOD PRODUST. SAVED A LOT BUYING HERE."
2,Difficult to use,"Getting the sensor to be activated is a painful task. I had to re-position myself many times to have BP measured. Many times the monitor stopped working mid-way because I moved a bit and gave inconsistent results within 1-2 mins of measurement.Frankly, I am not a big fan of wrist monitors. Arm-monitors are more reliable albiet a bit bulky in today's technology standards."
5,Easy to Use!!!!!!,"I purchased this unit because I was having trouble using my wifes arm-cuff-style blood pressure monitor. I found this to be just what the doctor ordered. It is very easy to use. The Advanced Positioning Sensor makes it imposible to position incorrectly, and the reading have agreed with the one's my doctor gets with his expensive unit. Best of all, the easy of using it is fantastic. I just slip it on my wrist, press the start button, position the unit near my heart, and it does the rest. OUTSTANDING. I would highly recommend this unit to anyone."
5,Works great with heavy use,"We've used this in our medical practice for over two years and it continues to work really well. I'm sure it's not as accurate as traditional sphygmomanometer, but we've never had a problem with it. Couldn't ask for any more."
3,Nice features but not accurate,Bought the product for features and portability. I was impressed on how it functioned. Took it to my doctors office and compared it with the doctors instrument twice. HEM-650 readings were lower by as much as 14 points. The doctor told me that wrist monitors were not as accurate as the cuff monitors.I then bought the HEM-711 (cuff monitor) and compared it to the HEM-650. The HEM-711 readings were on average 7-10 points higher than the HEM-650.Kept the HEM-711 and returned the HEM-650.
1,Save your money,"Unacceptable performance, we returned it for a refund. This product is EXTREMELY sensitive to position of arm relative to heart and does not work with patients having compromised circulatory systems. Save your money, buy something else."
1,Awful product does not work for me,"I have been a medical professional for many years in the past. I know how to take pressure. I have had an Omron self BP cuff for about 7 years and it just got tuckered out and not doing its job any more so I decided to try a wrist model since I have trouble with my right hand and it is hard to pump the bulb to get the blood pressure.This thing did not work for me at all, I must have gotten a bad one. At first it was giving me a wonderful reading of about 140/72, I wish, I normally can't get below 150/80, I was 158/88 last week at the Doctors office.This morning when pressure is usually high this machine registered 63/44I am dead and don't know it yet. If you buy this make sure you can take it back, I bought it at a local CVS drug store, it cost more but now I don't have to waste time and money on shipping it back. Make sure you can test it first. I am going back to the manual unit. This is not a product you want to fool with, it literally can mean your life."
2,Easy to use but disappointing results,"Based on the reviews I purchased 2 of these, one for my mother-in-law and one for me. I found them very easy to set up and use. However, my mother-in-law's systolic pressure would run 10-15 points low on this monitor as checked against her doctor's results, and at age 88 this is her most important reading. Both of my numbers would vary by 10-15 points in either direction compared to an arm unit that had been calibrated at a doctor's office. I liked the units and found them easy to use but the readings were so erratic as to be unusable, so I have returned both."
2,NOT ACCURATE!,"It is hard to get the monitor in the right position to get a reading. Also my blood pressure has never been as low as the reading I am getting on this machine on a regular basis. My pressure was going up, that is why I purchased this monitor to begin with. I will continue to use it for a few more days and if I am still getting the much lower readings than I do at the doctors office, then I will return it."
4,Works well,The unit does a good job once I learned how to use it right. Takes a while to get it going cause you have to get it position just right near you heart. Once I had that down it worked very well. Can't comment on how accurate it is though.
4,Very good item.,"I think this is a great item. It works very well and the readings are very close to what I see in my doctors office. I recommend this if you are looking for a simple, inexpensive blood pressure unit."
3,Omron Monitor,The accuracy seems to be quite good but positioning is critical and not where I would expect it to be. I have to put it at my throat to get a reading.
2,OMRON B/P Wrist Monitor,"Difficult to use, arm with monitor on has to be held next to chest just right or it will not operate. Documentation vague."
4,"easy to use, but, at times inaccurate",My daughter is a nurse and I compared the readings from the Omron to her taking my blood pressure. Out of 6 readings only 1 was as accurate as my daughter's reading and the other 5 the Omron was higher by an average of about 10/10.
4,Excellent product,"Very good product! In fact, I bought 3... one for me, one for my sister and one for my son!!!"
3,Comment,Portable and easier to travel with than my usual monitor. Record of past readings useful. Some difficulty positioning unit correctly over heart to read pressure.Omron HEM-650 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with APS (Advanced Positioning Sensor)
2,Convenient but How to Compare to Doctor Readings?,"This is a convenient product and easy to use. However, it is concerning if you are watching your blood pressure to realize its values at least for me are well below the readings taken in the doctor's office. It would be good to have some explanation with it as to how it should compare to the full blown blood pressure readings."
5,Compact & Accurate,"This blood pressure monitor is very compact, making it a good choice for traveling. Read the instructions, and after a few trials you will obtain quick, accurate readings."
2,Won't Last Long,I bought the Omron wrist monitor and used it for 2 years. Then it just stopped working. New batteries didn't help.I would recommend a newer model.
1,Does not work at all,Initially it worked. After couple of months the sensor does not work properly. I do not recommend this product to anyone who wants to use it in a clinic. It takes several tries to get the reading. its a waste of time using this product.The problem could be smaller wrist cuff. Does not work for most of the people with larger wrists.
5,Very Handy Device,"This monitor is very easy to use, and it is accurate. I like it a lot, and recommend it to everyone."
3,not helpful for exercise goals,"I'm in good health and wanted a wrist blood pressure meter to tell my BP and pulse at intervals of vigorous exercise. I would stop fast biking after 10 minutes, sit still, put on the meter, and then be unable to get a reading. The meter would show error messages time after time, while the positioning feature would only allow the unit to begin inflating when my wrist was held up in the sky. By the time my heart settled down enough for the meter to work, my pulse and blood pressure were already down significantly. What's the point of the positioning indicator -- I know my heart position better than it does."
3,Hmm !,APS does not work and my doctor finds that my systolic is 30 points higher than Omron wrist Monitor reads.
1,BP PATIENT,"HAVE AN OMRON WRIST MONITOR FROM YEARS AGO AND NO PROBLEM. PURCHASED ANOTHER WITHIN THE PAST YEAR AND HAD ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS, GOT RID OF IT AND BOUGHT ANOTHER A FEW WEEKS AGO AND HAVE A PROBLEM TODAY OF NO READING APPEARING ON THE SCREEN. IT IS QUITE DISGUSTING ."
4,Omraon HEM-650 Wrist Blood Pressure monitor,"The Omron HEM-650 works well. It agrees well with the Omron arm blood pressure monitor, usually reading 2 to 3% higher, but it is sensative to wrist position. It checks to see if the wrist is at heart level,but even a few inches difference will change the reading a few percent. I like it, as I can use it easily at work and elsewhere, but for better accuracy I use an arm blood pressure monitor at home."
1,OMRON: POOR QUALITY AND POOR SERVICE,"I bought this cuff and it no longer worked after only the second time using it. Sent it back to the company along with a check for $5 to cover repair/shipping. They sent it back and it still didn't work. I WOULD NEVER, EVER BUY FROM OMRON AGAIN. Bought a CVS cuff and after several hundred uses, it works just fine. I would give 0 stars for this piece of junk if it were possible."
2,Always wrong results for me,"Maybe for you it will work better, but I return this product because it shows the pressure always wrong.What is nice that the company refunded all money including shipping pretty fast. Thats why I gave additional star."
5,Excellent Blood Pressure Monitor from Amazon.com,"On the advice of my cardiologist, I searched for a device to monitor my blood pressure and pulse. A friend suggested the Omron wrist monitor which I subsequently purchased. It was extremely easy to set up (changing the monitor position from left to right wrist) and also easy to use. Being able to periodically check my blood pressure has done wonders for my peace of mind."
5,Patients love it,"Finally something that works, is peer reviewed in journals and is accurate, and takes the pressure of even my heaviest patients, without hurting them. Large upper arms are painful to take BPs in. This solves that problem and makes it possible for patients to have their BPs taken without having to take their blouses or shirts off. HIghly recommended"
3,Heath Zenith Remote & Receiver,"This is a replacement to one I have owned for about 5 years. My old one was great and I never had any problems until a few months ago. It would turn the lamp off and on, but the dimmer didn't work. Also I have 2 lamps and it stopped working on the second lamp. So, after searching everywhere, I found this one. I have another receiver. This one comes with only one receiver, but the remote can operate 2 receivers separately. So, now I can use it with 2 lamps separately. Just a note, that this remote seems sluggish. My old one was not. I do need to press it a couple of times, but it works, dims, turns off and on the lamps. The lamps are in different rooms, but I can operate them both with the remote. It's much better than having to walk across the room and lean over furniture to turn the light on or off. The reason I like this one is because it doesn't just turn the light on and off, but has the dimmer. It will not work with the new light saver type of lamps."
3,Size is a Bit SMALL,While these gloves came quickly they are not sized for normal to large hands. They barely fit my hands which are not large but my wife likes them as they do fit her smaller hands.
3,What's here is great...,"...but a lot of the game's music didn't make the jump to the CD. Missing arethe songs that play in the Bullworth cliques' hideouts, the tunes from thestores and arcade games, and the more ambient themes, like the locker-pickingsong. I'm especially disappointed the tunes from ""The Final Cut"" and thePreppies' and Townies' hideouts weren't included.Still, the tracks that are here are improved, somewhat extended versions ofwhat you'll hear on your PS2. Overall, it's a worthwhile purchase."
5,Highly Recomended,"It is a nice book on the subject, well written and presented, with beautiful photos and many practical techniques.I purchased a similar book, twice the price and I regret it.This book worth every penny and much more."
5,garment bag,"We purchased this bag for our son's wedding in Mexico. We packed three suits , my dress and 4 pairs of dress shoes, and there was still room to spare. Plus, since it's a tri-fold, it is really convenient for air travel. Highly recommend!!"
3,Don't like the color. Design is not that great.,I despise the firetruck red color. The ridges are too narrow to in my opinion(you have to push it down hard for it to stay) and the one wide one in the center is too wide. Couldn't they measure an avg cigarette during the design stage. Whatever though. I just wanted something to place my ashes in while on the computer.
3,came shattered,"Shoved in an envelope without much packing. Brittle plastic rebelled.How do you rate something like this? It was a cheap ashtray and proved that in shipping. But, there is a place for cheap ashtrays and it would have served its purpose had in been in about 20 fewer pieces."
3,The Big Easy Soundtrack,"I have to admit unlike most people I bought this album only to hear Dennis Quaid's song ""Closer to You"". His voice is reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen. The music of ""Closer to You"" is reminiscent of Al Stewart's ""Time Passages"". I can't seem to find any MP3s of Dennis Quaid songs to buy online. I think the rest of the album is great however. I love the Dixie Cups song ""Iko Iko"". All the songs are fun, dance songs. Many sound like square dancing songs with Jamaican influences and French influences."
3,Disappointed that many songs were missing.,"This is the one and only soundtrack I have ever purchased, and I purchased it because of the music in the movie. The movie had 18 songs credited to it. I was disappointed when I purchased the CD and found so many (8)songs missing. Then to confuse me more, there are 2 songs on the CD that I cannot find in the video. The quality was good, better than the video, and the music itself makes me want to dance. I can smell the food and taste the beer and feel the roots of the music when I listen to the CD. I consider it a good sampler of Cajun/Louisiana type music."
1,Truly a Stinker!,"Iko Iko, By the Dixie Cups is the only thing on this CD thats even listenable. Dennis Quaid, even though he is a terrible singer, is far from the worst artist on this compilation, if you dare to call it that. I would call it something closer to compost. So much of this CD is just filler, and muck, but probably the worst song ever made, by any artist is Zydeco Gris Gris. This song is so bad it made me want to throw upthe first time I heard it. This CD is one to have if you want to make ANY other CD sound good. I kept the CD around for a joke as it so very bad.. it's laughable.. but I just couldn't stand having anymore, and so burned it with a blowtorch. Don't waste your money on this piece of Garbage. Flushing the bills would be a better use of money. !"
1,"Avoid, Avoid, Avoid","Of all the many thousands of reviews I have written, The Big Easy Soundtrack gets my award for being the worst of the worst.Do yourself a favor and skip this disc at all costs, its just not worth the time and the money. You would be better off throwing your money out the window, that way you will have only wasted your money, and not your time. The people who have written the other reviews of this album on here obviously have no musical taste or credentials. This is sound, (I would not call this music)at it's worst. Avoid it !!!Robert Reman,Editor of Music Review Weekly International"
4,Good for the price,"I'm pretty happy with this charger.Pros: Good price, all-in-one capabilitiescons: chords are short and non-retractable."
1,A disapontment,"Basically a collection of color film clips which do seem to be from Midway. But no narrative describing the battle or its significance or what you are looking at. If you don't know what the battle of Midway is about before you see this, you won't know afterward either."
4,Artist and fighter,Ford risked his life filming much of this footage in the face of incoming Japanese strafing his position. It is an important film to see and know about.
3,Only in the Hood....,I felt this book was a very decent read.The beggining of the story had me kind of nervous because I felt the author was introducing to many characters. I also had Ishmail's identity figured out as soon as he was introduced.That was about the only part that was predictable to me.Every thing else through me for a loop and had me guessing.The end was quite shocking and I did not expect things to go down the way it did.Other than that Im looking forward to reading part 2.
2,I'm Confused,"The label on the bowl says 35 grams is in the bowl and that it is 110 calories, but when I weighed it myself on my food scale it weighed almost twice that! I'm confused, does the whole bowl really contain 110 calories? I really want to know can someone help?"
3,S.Smith in Oklahoma,"This product was good, but out of 6 cases, 15 bowls were open and we cannot use them, trying to return them."
5,I've used this during the few weeks that I have been trying to cut down. I've dropped about 8 lbs in under 3 weeks.,Obviously the credit is not all given to this... I have busted my butt in the gym and have been eating less. But this gives me clean energy and seems to be working pretty nicely
5,Green Tea Extract,I have been using this supplement to assist in losing weight and it has helped to give me a little extra boost of energy.
4,Great energy source.,"I'm a green tea fanatic, so I figured I'd try this stuff, even though I'm already consuming about 6-10 cups of green tea a day. On the first week of taking this product, I noticed no difference in my energy levels. I hit my usual 3:00pm slump -- every day. I followed the directions perfectly by taking one pill daily with a meal. On the second week, I decided to take two pills a day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and I noticed a HUGE difference in my energy levels. I am now on the fourth week of taking these. With them, along with 4 tbsps of apple cider vinegar a day and drinking copious amounts of water, I have lost four pounds. Not bad for minimal effort.I give this product four stars because the directions should say to take two a day. Also, I had two 3:00pm slumps after I started taking two. In conclusion, this product isn't a miracle worker, but it is certainly the boost I wanted. Give it a try!"
1,Zero results.,"I've been faithfully taking one pill after lunch since I ordered well over one month ago. I haven't noticed any results -- no weight loss, no energy boost, literally nothing at all. I plan on finishing the bottle since I paid for it, but will definitely not bother ordering a second."
3,Meh,Don't really know what to say about this product. I was recently diagnosed as being pre-diabetic so I was told to get a bunch of pills to help clear our toxins and regulate my blood sugar. No clue if it is working or not.
1,Not happy about product,I have been taking this green tea extract for 2 weeks and I read the other reviews. This product has done nothing for me now it's to late to retun for a refund.
5,Exactly what I wanted.,"I don't like green tea in beverage form all that much, but I wanted the benefits. After a little searching I settled on buying this. It had everything I wanted: standardized pills, lots of them, and a great price. NOW is a reputable brand, unlike many of those suspicious fat loss supplements companies with names you've never heard of.Upon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised to find that each pill has the green tea + a 100% daily dose of vitamin C. A nice bonus. I take two of these pills at a time, 3x a day. Zero side effects besides the caffeine buzz. After a month of the green tea + a great diet/workout regimen, I am pleased to say I have *not* lost weight, but I have lost body fat! Approx 5% down. I genuinely believe the green tea helped.People expecting a miraculous fat burner should look elsewhere. Green tea can help you lose visceral fat if you are already eating well and exercising, but it can't do all the work for you."
4,Supplements,Green Tea extract is a great thing to add to your diet regardless of what you're doing. These pills are cheap and give you nutrients that your body may need. I would recommend taking this product if you have the extra money to spare and want to get the benefits from green tea without actually drinking anything.
3,"Great seller, just didn't work for me.","The seller deserves 5 stars. I can't keep taking the vitamins because they interacted with my antidepressant (Pristiq.) They honestly did help suppress my appetite off late-night cravings, and provided more energy than coffee did. So much so that I couldn't sleep at night. Oh well. Win some, lose some."
3,Okay,"I haven't seen much weightloss from this product alone, which is why I bought it in the first place, but it does have other great benefits. It gives me heart burn and makes me very nauseous when taken on an empty stomach, but otherwise, its fine."
4,Take them faithfully and you will see results,"At first I would only take one of these every now and then; often going long periods of time without taking any at all. Until this summer, when I began to take 2 a day with lunch or dinner. I have to say that along with having a job that required me to be on my feet a lot and also taking these EVERY day, I lost about 15 pounds in 3 months. It wasn't extreme weight loss but it made a difference. I really did not change my diet either. Just a little more exercise and these and I went from 156 to 141. I can only imagine what real dieting and some serious exercise would've done. I need to buy again soon because I'm almost out."
