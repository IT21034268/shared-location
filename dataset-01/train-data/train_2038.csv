4,GREAT ALL AROUND PLAYHOUSE!!,"I JUST BOUGHT THIS PLAY HOUSE FOR MY 2 YEAR OLD TWIN DAUGHTERS. I LOOKED AROUND AT LARGER AND MORE EXPENSIVE ONES, BUT SETTLED ON THIS ONE FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS.* IT'S JUST THE RIGHT SIZE FOR A PLAY HOUSE. MY GIRLS ALREADY HAVE A PLAY KITCHEN AND A TABLE AND CHAIRS ETC. TO PLAY WITH SO I WANTED A PLAY HOUSE THAT WAS JUST A PLAY HOUSE. THIS ONE MAY NOT HAVE A LOT OF ""EXTRA"" FEATURES BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A STANDARD PLAY HOUSE, IT'S GREAT. THE KITCHEN AREA IS BASICALLY JUST A SMALL SINK AND 2 LITTLE STOOLS.* THE BUILT IN FLOOR IS AN AWESOME FEATURE!* THE OPENNESS OF IT IS GREAT AND A GOOD SAFETY FEATURE TOO.* THE PRICE CAN'T BE BEAT.OVERALL: IF YOUR KIDS HAVE A LOT OF OTHER ""PRETEND"" TOYS ALREADY, THIS HOUSE IS PERFECT. IT'S JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM ENTERTAINED. IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO MAKE A BIG INVESTMENT ON SOMETHING WITH A LARGE KITCHEN AREA AND LOTS OF ROOM FOR PRETEND PLAY - THEN THIS ONE IS NOT FOR YOU."
3,Still waiting for my son to like this.....,"We bought the cottage for my son for Christmas, he was 20 months at the time. I thought he would just love it, but we are still waiting for him to catch on. The only thing he will do with it even now is go inside a play ""peek"" through the windows. My son tends to be a bit of a climber, and this is definitely not a climbing toy! I guess we will know better next year! One great point about this cottage is the floor! Most cottage/house toys don't have a floor and this one does, which makes it real nice to have on any type of surface without worrying about your little one's feet."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased ""New Life"" because I own (and love) Intro's debut album.The harmonies sound beautiful, as expected, but the production lacked variety. Both chapters--""intro to street"" and ""intro to new life""--were low-key.The songs sounded so much alike that I could not tell them apart with casual listening. The only memorable track was ""love me better"" because it was the loudest. Even the choruses were bland, can't remember a single one!Intro's first album did not have this problem.""New Life"" is boring. Two stars for harmonies, zero stars for production."
5,Intro's second CD's should give everyone new life,"This CD is the sophmore project from Intro who dazzled us on their debut CD. This CD shows us a mature side from this group and is more balanced from start to finish with the opener, ""Strung Out On Your Lovin'"". Then the next song, ""Funny How Time Flies"" is a straight Intro cut with a hip hop vibe with Intro sultry vocals. Some of the other tracks that caught me by eye is ""New Life"" & ""What Would You Do For Love""(Re-make of Bobby Caldwell's chart topper). After Boyz II Men & Jodeci, this was one of the best groups of the '90's hands down and I still think a lot of people slept on this group. I will always remember this group forever. RIP Kenny ""G-Love"" Greene."
4,"A calmer ""INTRO"".","I really like this album AND the first. However, this album is not like their first Hip-Hop influeced R&B album. So if you're looking for ""Let me be the one"" or ""Love Thang"" ....this album is not going to keep your interest. This is a much more calmer and mature INTRO. This album seems to reflect a collage of peaks and valleys that the group may have experienced before Kenny's death. Although my favorite songs on this album (without a doubt) are ""My Song"" and ""Funny How Time Flies""......Kenny's signature voice really shine's on ""Spending My Life with You..."
3,Cute,"The interchangeable tops are fun and an interesting way to explore what you want out of your toys. There's many choices and I enjoy myself switching around the tops and finding new ways to play. The little ""stand"" on the bottom of the bullet is also a good handle.Otherwise, the vibration is... sub par for that the batteries should offer. The interchangeable tops soften some of it and otherwise it's just not that powerful a motor. I like it powerful, though, so I may not be the best to say, but it makes a good introductory toy, though you can't expect it to get anyone off.If you want to ease someone into the idea of toys and their different shapes, great.If you're looking for wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, or even just a good new toy, this isn't it."
5,cds,"The CDs sent by Amazon were awesome! My grandson also thoroughly enjoyed his, too. Since I have been placed in the rock and roll teacher position by my daughter, I'll be back for more music and tee shirts!"
5,Lovin It,"Does anyone really need to write another glowing review of this Album. The title Speaks for itself so I'll comment on the music. Born to be Wild gave Heavy Metal it's name, Monster is a hauntingly political wake up call of tour de force proportion, Snow-blind friend and the Pusher, written by country music great Hoyt Axton during a time when ""snow"" referred to Heroin rather than Cocaine are both still relevant. I saw John Kay and Steppenwolf in concert a few years ago. While some of the old faves still on tour seem to just phone it in, I was left with no doubt that he still feels everything he sings, deeply."
5,not just one song,"when you hear the word of steppenwolf thrown about in music mags and channels you naturally think of the hippy anthem ""born to be wild"" the song that defined everything to anyone who doesn't want to be stuck in between 4 walls..but there is a big BUT steppenwolf weren't just one hit wonder they made loads of classic slice rock songs...one song on this greatest hits that sticks out the most is ""the pusher"" i first heard the song not by steppenwolf but it was on ""nico"" album by blind melonand shannon hoons vocal intepertation is very much like the orignal...also i've heard raven's heavy metal version of ""born to be wild"" on ""all systems go the anthology""this is a class collection from the hippy rock band that stir up images of riding down a highway on a motorbike with a chicknot giving in to society"
3,Steppenwolf,"Well, I love the first two songs, but not so into the others. Maybe it's a little before my age or something, but otherwise the CD was in great shape and the delivery time was all I expected. I would order from this seller again with no problem."
3,head scratcher,i needed this book for a graduate religion course. i think the authors have their hearts in the right place but the terminology and sentence structures they use left me scratching my head more than a few times. not for the uninitiated.
2,Second tier vintage music videos,"This DVD is a collection of vintage clips of second or third tier musicians, dancers and singers. It's an amusing documentary for an aficionado of twenties and thirties music, but the announcer discusses the main artists who performed the music and then shows a clip with the lesser known artists."
3,incomplete greatest hits,"I'm waiting for this album for long long time,but too bad,...some of Shanice Wilson songs are missed.There's no ""It's For You"", ""Saving Forever For You"" and ""Don't Break My Heart"". This is incomplete greatest hits..hope Shanice would remake this greatest hits record again."
3,kinda early for greatest hits,i think Shanice is a good singer.i've liked her from back in 87.but she hasn't done enough good material or been out long enough to have a hits collection.this is one of the many problems now with the music business.folks out for a few years getting greatest hits.
5,A Marvelous Resource for School Parents,"No Parent Left Behind informs and empowers parents of elementary school children, and is the first resource to define words, phrases and processes involved in today's education. The book includes how to work with children at home and how to prepare infants and toddlers for success in elementary school."
2,not happening,"I was disappointed with this album. YOu get all of the four tet videos but they are pretty bland and boring. ""She moves she"" is pretty funny, and the best on the dvd.The cd is not that good at all. The single for ""my angel rocks back and forth"" is nice, but the remix and other tracks are so-so.Four tet should have waited to do the cd/dvd thing that everyone else is doing, this is a waste of money. 2 stars-1 for the single, and 1 for the ""ok"" video. get pause and rounds."
5,Excellent dance music!!!! Move over Madonna!,"I now have a new CD dominating my CD player! Ilona's EURO-CIZE really gets me going and jump-starts every day for me. Right from the start this CD thrusts me into the nightclub with a powerful first track, and it doesn't let go. Each consecutive song keeps me pulled in and begging for more...and ILONA EUROPA delivers, song after song! This CD is excellent for a workout CD too. It gets me pumped up and takes me through a major workout and then cools me down, just enough to start it all over again. My workouts will never be tiring and boring again. I highly recommend this CD for everyone's CD player, and every DJ's set list! Move over Madonna, there's a new voice in town!"
2,Difficult Flash,"A very difficult flash to put on. The Power button does not always respond. The first flash returned as faulty. The second one almost was returned, but Olympus helped me out. The representative also had a difficult time putting it on. The Power button has to be touched in a very special way.Not recommended for this reason."
4,Patience,I wish I had saved a little longer and purchased the FL50 which has a higher recovery speed and can be used with external battery packs like the quantum.
5,Great flash - was unsure but am glad I bought it,"I was unsure if I should have purchased the FL-50 but this flash is very powerful and does all I need. I love the ability to bounce and swivel the flash. I do think it takes a little longer to recharge than I had expected, but that may be due to the batteries I use. Regardless it was only a relevant issue once or twice over the holidays when I was madly taking photos of kids on Christmas day."
3,Big Flash,Seems difficult to coordinate with camera. Too many controls. I wish it were more automated and could be controlled by camera settings
5,Olympus FL-36 flash,It came in perfect condition at a short anount of time. It was exatly what I wanted.
2,Compromise at best,"This clip is designed for use with the Nokia car mounting kit. As a stand-alone clip it just can't stay on. The clip doesn't have enough clearance for a simple belt, and it doesn't have enough holding power."
3,Good buy!,I bought both Hidden Beach vol.1 and 3. This one was good but not better than vol.1. It's still worth the money.
1,not a good foundation for good(real) music.,"it seems like this is the direction that r&b/ hiphop/rap is going now,what happened to the real bands that played real music such as the horn sections,guitar, precussions, drums and vocals that can really get out there. i guess i have matured and prefer mature music. after seeing kem in concert and purchasing his cd,it really makes cds like this sound like a bunch of untalented people behind a computer screen making beats because they cant play instruments and cant hit those difficult notes like the days of old. but... this is just my opinion of what music is today."
5,Buck 303 Cadet pocket knife,"extremly beautiful knife, well crafted here in the U.S.A. I needed one to round out my pocket knife collection. Just a little smaller than a Case med stockman. Blades super sharp right out of the box. Great value and quick ship."
5,Buck 303 Cadet Knife Review,"This is my third Buck 303 Cadet pocket knife, the first getting a bit worn from long use and the second being confiscated by security officials at our state capitol building who enforced the policy considering all knives to be a weapon. I didn't argue the point over knife being a weapon, but acquired another new one as soon as possible. Over perhaps 30 years of use this knife model has proven to be convenient for general use and has endured much abuse without damage that could not be corrected by proper sharpening. I would recommend this item for anyone that wishes to carry a pocket knife full time for general use, but it is certainly not an effective weapon!"
4,Victorinox is better,"I bought this pocket knife thinking in Buck quality, is a good Knife, robust, the steel is very sharp and easy to maintain, but the global finish is no so good. I prefer the Victorinox finish, look and feel better in the hand."
3,Quality has slipped since my previous Buck purchase,"I hate it when I lose a knife, but I thought I was okay this time, because Buck still made the model I lost. Got my replacement Saturday, but... it's no replacement. It's going back.One of the exterior rivets sticks out too far with a sharp edge, like it's mis-sized, or someone forgot to burnish it. At the least, it'd be sure to put a hole in my pocket.Over all, the feel just isn't what I remember my last knife being like when it was new. The plastic handles, probably Delrin, feel rough and cheap.This one's going back, and now I need to decide whether to risk another one that I'll have to return on my penny, or go on a hunt for an old one elsewhere. I've been carrying pocketknives for over 3 decades, and I feel pretty naked without one right now, but I simply cannot allow workmanship like this, from a well-respected company, to go unchallenged. I'll be writing to Buck directly as well."
5,Excellent pocket knife,This made in USA pocket knife met my needs . All three blades of the knife were sharp out of the box . The fit and finish was excellent . Buck continues to offer excellent knifes.Can't beat the price and service from Amazon.
1,This book thoroughly reeks!,"I am neither a UCLA nor a USC fan. I bought the book for entertainment. Unfortunately, this book did everything but entertain. It was boring, had stupid humor, and focused too much on football. I am going to tell you the messages this book was trying to convey so that you can save your money:Bruins are poor Football players are stupid Cheerleaders are fat Professors are incompetentThere you have it, the whole book."
1,Save your money,"Instead of wasting five bucks on this drivel (and that goes for the rest of this guy's ""I Hate"" books), go to Westwood Village and buy a Bruin a beer.-- USC Grad"
1,I tried to read this book....,"I tried to read this book but it had so many big words in it .... Thank gosh my USC application was not so tough to read... I'm an English major too here at USC. and while my gramer is not good my credit was good.I am happy to see us get back at UCLA because they always outdo us in everything. THey deserve it because everybody is always ""UCLA this, UCLA won that...!"" I am starting inferiority complex after spending even just a couple months here at USC. GO Trogans!"
3,Nice package poor quality,The case that the tools come in is very nice. However the quality of the tools are poor considering the $40 price tag.
3,Quality tools but incomplete,"This toolset has quality precision tools that come in a rugged container and good to use. What makes it 3 stars is that it is incomplete in terms of ""precision tools"" as it doesn't have a torx set nor a hex set. These are essential tools for PC or any other electronic projects. This is only good i guess for fixing your glasses, or get these ones and get torx and hex sets, that's what I did."
1,Pinnacle does not support this product,"Pinnacle withdrew this product from the marketplace fairly quickly. Their ""support"" desk no longer offers support. In fact, they suggest doing a Google search and then they apologize for the ""inconvenience."" I've had this happen with 2 Pinnacle products now. There will NOT be a 3rd time. There are better products and better companies out there to do business with."
4,Decent product,"Installation was easy, and so far could capture video without problems.From VCD - A bit poor, the images were not very sharp to begin with, the captured .mpg came out even more blurry.From DVD - Decent quality, able to watch it full screen.TV - Even without antenna/cable it managed to find 1 channel, but it was all noise."
4,Bed Rail,"Hello, I recently purchased a bed rail for my 2 year old grand daughter. I was a bit concerned when it arrived in many pieces. It also concerned me because it appeared flimsy and is plastic.To date it has done the job I needed it for and I am Happy to say it has held up nicely and it is a perfect fit for the twin beds length.I am very happy with this bed rail and would recomend it."
5,Not for kids only,"My 12 yr old Yorkshire Terrier 10-11 lbs, has a habit of sleeping on the edge of the bed,and keeps falling out. With a congestive heart and occasional seizures, This was a concern. After finding and receiving the bed guard, the problem was solved. Being adjustable allowed him to use his Solvit PupSTEP + Plus Pet Stairs, which looks good together. With Holistic & Vet medicines, he seems to be doing good, due to the vets prognosis. Assembly was easy, and delivery was prompt, Thank you Mattan Store."
2,The plastic seems flimsy,"There is not enough clearance for my tot's mattress, which is about an inch thicker than most mattresses. The plastic of the projected parts that go between the mattress and the box doesn't feel strong. I seriously doubt that this rail can hold up when my tot rolls up against it when sleeping. I am not going to take risks on my son and I am returning it. (BTW, I didn't order this from Amazon.com.)"
4,Best bet for needed length of guard rail.,"I purchased this item, as opposed to any others available, because my little boy has a loft-bed (height of a top-bunk-bed) and was worried about him falling off such a height. I have it fully extended to the 60"" option and it has kept my son safe. I did notice that if he plays in his bed that it has disconnected at the length-adjustment-connector. But he has to be pretty rough to make this happen and it is still a strong hold. I am sure that he would wake up if this, though unlikely, somehow happened in his sleep because with the rails that go under the bed the guard rail, though disconnected, is still fairly strong. The bed that my son is in is longer than the regular size twin bed because it's made for college students and the length of this rail is still substantially long enough to provide safety."
5,great musician,"I saw Kaki for the first time on the David Letterman show and was so excited by her performance that I got both of her CDs. I was even more thrilled when I listened to them! She is a great songwriter--her songs are beautiful and lyrical as well as exciting and jarring. She can seems to be able to write a wide variety of different styles. I am really enjoying these and recommend them even to people who don't know much about guitar music (which includes me). And she's a babe, and anyone who saw her performance on Letterman can attest to this!"
1,disgusted,"As the mother of an 8 year old girl who is learning to play the guitar, I was so thrilled that my daughter had a ""role model"" female guitarist to look up to in Kaki King.What was I supposed to think, when my daughter asked me to explain something on Kaki's website. I thought it would be a guitar question, but she wanted to know what the word ""orgasm"" meant. I was stunned to read this at Kaki King's question and answer web page (direct quote): ""a little awkward when you want to spend the night getting trashed in dim bars. When 50 cent signed my t!t$ I had an orgasm.""I don't know a lot about acoustic guitar music, and acoustic guitar players. We are parents to children who are bombarded with inappropriate messages. To read this filth at the website of a ""female role model"" guitarist is shocking.We will never buy another Kaki King CD ever again."
1,worst guitar recording ever,"Some people may call Kaki King ""Kaki Queen,"" but who cares what her family and friends think! There are a lot of people who use other words to describe her, and they're not very flattering.But more to the point, this cd is nothing but guitar noodling. They're not even real compositions. It's embarrassing to compare Kaki King to any of the ""real"" solo acoustic players because she is SO inferior - as a player, as a composer, as an original voice.And then there's her singing. Terrible singing. Terrible voice.This is without a doubt the worst guitar recording ever released."
4,Creative and driving acoustic guitar,"A wonder with her instrument, the woman behind the guitar sound from the movie, August Rush, Kaki King is truly gifted."
1,"If I could give lower, I would","Never in the history of the instrument has anyone this amateurish gotten this much exposure.Unlike Michael Hedges, who added a percussive style to an existing musical foundation, King, like Preston Reed, show only novel skills and no depth of musical understanding.In layman's terms, Kaki King, creates nothing more than noise with her guitar."
1,nausea,"Wretch, heave, gag, and chuck. She plays guitar, but she makes it sound like a lawn mower - except a lawn mower has better rhythm.Ttiresome, tasteless twaddle. Tedium, ad infinitum, ad nauseum.Barf."
1,Wanky dreck.,"There's a reason that solo instrumental performance has fallen by the wayside, with the exception of Kaki King -- It's boring and is only interesting to the person playing it and other instrumentalists. Not only this, but it's terribly unoriginal; Kaki King owes quite a bit to Michael Hedges, who, contrary to popular belief, is just as wanky, self-indulgent, and uninteresting as Yngwie Malmsteen or Allan Holdsworth. This is a musical one-trick pony. This is the equivalent of a seal balancing a ball on its nose -- Novel entertainment, but nothing of any true substance."
1,Wanna Be Hedges,"This girl is such an obvious Hedges ripoff, it's not even funny. I mean, it's like listening to someone who took every one of his recordings and tweaked them a tiny bit and renamed them. I don't know why that bothers me so much other than the lack of authenticity. And what I feel that she lacks is the actual musicality and melodic spirit that Hedges wove into his work."
1,"suitable for the ""Gong Show""","I wish there was something like ""American Idol"" for guitar players, where the judges could be people like Andres Segovia, Django Reinhardt, Jimi Hendrix, Michael Hedges, Robert Johnson, John Fahey, Wes Montgomery, etc.I would give anything to see the expressions on their faces as Kaki King plays her guitar.This CD is a showcase of techniques taken straight from Preston Reed's instructional video. The mark of a bad Michael Hedges impersonator, or in this case, a bad Preston Reed impersonator, is developing all the technique with none of the emotion or musicality.The music on this CD sounds like it was played by a robot.If there were a ""Gong Show"" for solo guitarists, Kaki King would be the perfect contestant."
1,outraged,"I am the mother of an eight year old girl who takes guitar lessons. Her hero, her 'role model,' is Kaki King. Our daughter was very excited hearing Kaki King on the radio, and asked if she could visit her website.The next thing we know, our eight year old is asking us questions about getting trashed in bars, sex, and the female climax. She read about this - of all places - on Kaki King's website, in her question and answer area. Kaki describes in detail how she opened her blouse so 50 Cent could sign his autograph on her, and she achieved climax. Except Kaki's language is filthy.This artist is NO role model for anyone, least of all young girls. She has every right to say what she wants on her website. Our family loves acoustic guitar music. But we will never again buy another Kaki King CD for as long as we live."
4,OUTSATNDING GUITARWORK,"Along with Goren Sollscher's ELEVEN STRING BAROQUE, this CD is just an amzing testament to an incredible guitarist, one you're not likely to hear as incredibly presented as this any time soon. Sollscher takes remarkable leaps with his dynamic 11 string work. Listening to King on this CD, I thought she could give the Viking a run for his money with just the 6 she plucks, strums, hammers and bends.Having siad that, this is not the heavy mental stuff essayed by Michael Hedges, but more in touch with the melodic spirit embraced by middle period Bruce Cockburn or Leo Kottke. There is a sense of song about every track. There is precious little adornment and effects. None are needed. She is her own woman and she holds down the center brilliantly, while leaping in extraordinary directions. Imagine Bill Bruford playing guitar.If you have an avocation for the six string, pick this up. This woman is going places. Ezra Mohawk finally has a worthy successor."
5,great album but buy the live version,"This album is one of the most artistically creative. It is the album that Pink Floyd's the wall was supposed to be. Gabriel's story is a worthy footnote in literature and should be dissected and taught in English classes across the country. There are a few problems with the studio album. I happen to...uhh..HATE Phil Collins' singing and his voice is a bit too prevalent. His drumming rules, though. Also the sound quality wasn't clear enough, too fuzzy for an album like this. The music itself is nicely written, and I love all the instrumentation except for the bass, which isn't very good. It is the greatest album of all time to clear your mind and lose yourself, though. The live version on the boxset is much better than the studio version. The sound quality is crystal clear and you can hardly hear Phil and his crappy voice. Love his drumming though, especially in Brand X. NUCLEAR BURN!!!"
4,Cool if you like bombast,"Peter Gabriel's last project with Genesis is the epitome of what 70s bombast rock was all about, when rock musicians wanted to be opera composers and suchlike. TLLDOB is probably the best of all of those, but you have to be in the mood for something like this before you put the CD in. It's not easy listening. It *is*, kind of, opera. Brilliantly well done, but, in essence, opera."
4,The most overlooked album by a most disrespected band,"Genesis, in the 1970's, particularly the Gabriel years, has to be one of the most underrated and disrespected bands of all time. In these early years, Genesis made some of the most beautiful, majestic, and brilliant music ever captured on record, and their stage show was equally mind-blowing. With the release of ""The Lamb..."" in 1974, and the tour that followed, they set new standards of intelligence in songwritting. ""The Lamb..."" flows from begining to end with a sonic quality that only the quintet Genesis of the time could do. If only Phil hadn't steered the ship into pop oblivion. I'm sorry, but Peter Gabriel will always be at his best with this band. People, buy this, and other Genesis albums of the 70's. You'll see what I mean!"
5,I'm Overwhelmed!,"Wow! Where to start? I was 2 years old when this came out, but I discovered it when I was fourteen. This was one of the most important albums in my life! This is certainly the high water mark of Genesis and rival ANY concept album ever recorded. thisalbum literally absorbed me and took me to another place every time I listen to it.I can't justify THE LAMB with any proper review due to the fact that if 10 people listen to it, they'll ponder ten different angles and interpertations. This is one of those rare recordings that you don't listen to, you EXPERIENCE it.The music shifts, bends, and generates a mellow flow from out of nowhere making every corner you turn a pleasent surprise.This is certainly not for everyone, however if you believe that music is art and should be approached as such, then THE LAMB will be a serious contender for yourdesert island senerio."
5,The Young Ovis Aries Prostrates Itself in the Big Apple,"Genesis is an acquired taste. They are a little too arty for many people, and I would never play them in the car with my co-workers on the way to lunch. However, if you are a fan, then this concept album revolving around Rael's nightmarish adventures should be worth your time. Using words to describe their music is futile. You either like the music, or you don't. I like ""Back In N.Y.C."", but all the cuts are good.TLLDOB comes with a booklet of lyrics and notes (requires a magnifing glass.)Other Genesis I have:Seconds Out (a good choice for beginners - double disc, live)Trespass (early, rough, pre-Hackett and Collins)Nursery CrymeWind and WutheringInvisible Touch (it's polished and pop-ish, but I like it)""You can tell by the night fires where Rael has been"""
5,Great remastering job,Have to say I was quite dissapointed with the original cd release of this album because of poor sound quality-namely tape hiss from the original master tape all the way through.Enter new technology to clean that up without losing any of the high end.Add to that a more pronounced low end with cleaner mids and this thing just sparkles coming out of my speaks.Phil's drums sound as if they are set up right in the living room.With an a-b comparison of the two-the originals are now officially tossed.
5,Wow!! A 70's rock cd that isn't overrated!,Well I have been a fan of Peter Gabriels solo stuff for a while now so I guess it was only a matter of time before I checked out Genesis. After reading the reviews here on amazon I was still ready to be let down. I mean you always here so much great stuff about a band like Led Zeppelin who are in my opinion are one of most overrated bands in history. So just like with many other highly praised cd's from this decade I expected the same reaction. Well I was very very surprised. This is an amazingly creative and original cd. I won't go into any real deatil about the songs but instead tell you to just go out and buy this cd. This deserves to be next to the likes of Low and Diamond Dogs by David Bowie which are both incredible and underrated albums of the 70's.
5,for everyone requesting,"If you truly love music.... you have to get this.If ever you ever were beaten down and had to to breathe, you need thisIf ever you get dis-enchanted with the rest of the carcass of the music industry, get this and give it a listen.Musically its brilliant. Philosophically it comes very close, and psychologically it is dazzlingIt is the 21st century everymans story"
3,Hard On The Ears,"I usually have a 3 strike rule that means i give an album 3 listens and if something doesent click by then i will never listen again. I first bought this cd in the summer of 2007 after buying a magazine that listed the best prog albums of all time and this one ranked high. Well aside from the title track and a few other tunes i could not stand this album it was a very diffacult listen with no rewards. I do prefer the earlier albums like Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot and Selling England By The Pound. I may have to give this album a fourth listen sometime soon i see all of the positive reviews for it. Sometimes i love Peter Gabriel and all his madness and other times some of his stuff is weird for the sake of being weird that i dont like. This album seems exactly that way plain strange and not in a good way."
3,Loud. Ness. War.,"You can hear the vocals much better in this version as well many details that usually got buried in the original. Much better mixes overall. I was really enjoying them until I realized the loudest parts seem oppressed. The music isn't allowed to breathe and get really loud and really quiet like on the original. When I checked this by importing the Mp3's into a computer the loudest parts are rife with clipping and digital distortion. To avoid this, buy the vinyl version and convert to Mp3 via a USB turntable."
1,darn it all,It starts with fly on a windshield. Half way through the song it stops and the next song starts. 5 songs not complete. Hopefully the whole songs are still in the cloud and i just had a bad signal while downloading to my phone. Ill give it a 5star as soon as i figure this out
3,Much better than Foxtrot,A little obscure in places but overall I enjoy this album. Interestingly dramatic enough to live up to the title. Not everything I wanted but I think it will grow on you.
2,Don't Buy the Import -- Argentina Version,"I received the import version today, and the mixing is more mono than stereo, and you have to turn up the volume to simply hear it. On the back of the CD, it says Definitive Edition Remaster, but the sound quality is, as I've mentioned, poor. Also, on the back, where it claims to be a Definitive Edition Remaster, it lists all the band members except Peter Gabariel -- which is a bit odd, as this was his last album with Genesis.The U.S. version does list Gabriel, which is one way of telling this is the real thing. Don't get the Argentina version, as it is not worth your money."
3,It's OK,The digital remix doesn't come close to the original vinyl. The depth of sound is missing. Only good thing I can say is the scratches on the vinyl are also missing
3,poorly done remix,Several songs have transitions from one song to the other that are abrupt and some end on the start of the other.
5,One of the best.,"One of the best albums of the 70's prog-rock era. If you like prog, you have to own this.Highly recommended!!"
5,the lamb,"Man, talk about a stunning album. this is one of those very unique albums from the 70's, probably in my top five of all time. You have to give this record time though, as many other reviewers state. If you really want to know what the peter gabriel era of Genesis was all about, this one and Selling England By The Pound are the ones to get (start with selling england). They are the best albums by the band."
5,The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway,The last album w/ Peter Gabriel great music and lyrics as always w/ Genesis. This is a must have for the Genesis collector's collection.
5,My deserted island choice,"A classic album of epic proportion.No other piece of music has ever effected me the way The Lamb has.The twisted tale of our hero Rael is accompanied by some of the most creative and intricate music ever produced. Each member of Genesis shines brightly here. Without a doubt, this is Genesis at it's height. Quite fitting that Peter Gabriel sees fit to leave after this one. How could you top such a masterpiece? You don't. Gems like this only come along once in a band's carreer and probably only once in a human lifespan. I sometimes wonder if I think too highly of this album because I discovered at a very impressionable age. It's very hard to judge that. All I know is that I see all music now in the shadow of this album. Let all who wish to string notes together refer to the Bible of progressive music... The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway."
3,Overall unnecessary,"I declare myself a fan of Genesis. I believe I have all their CDs. I use to listen to their music daily, in particular their first albums. Of course, I have always heard and read about their master work, The Lamb...But I have serious problems with it. I have listened to it hundred times, read the lyrics, investigate and open my mind to it. In my opinion, excepting some superb songs like Cuckoo Cocoon, this album is an unnecessary extension of the Supper's Ready. In particular the lyrics, which is rather obscure and vague. Of course, it is always possible to say that it means whatever the listener wants it to mean, as Genesis did, but this is a too easy way out, not taking responsibility. If the Lamb was the way, Peter Gabriel would have continued the same line. He did not. The Lamb represented the exhaustion of the inspiration. The top of it was perhaps the Supper's ready."
2,"Can You Say ""Filler""?",Two things: (1) There is more 'filler' material on this (still!) 2-disc set than is contained in a queen-size goose-downmattress. (2) The best thing that ever happened to both PeterGabriel and Genesis was him leaving.
2,Am I the onlyone to believe Peter Gabriel is a lousy singer?,"At least among the die hard prog rock fans who read these reviews, probably yes. But that guy was really terrible... Phil Collins was -still is!- so much better, but how can one say so without attracting a legion of ""pop hit ballad haters""...Anyway, The Lamb is lots of effect, little or no substance. I can picture poor bald Phil sitting behind the drums -he's always been an awesome drummer- and thinking ""man, I wish we stopped playing these crummy pretentious thang and do some good music for once, even if it does not have fifty chord changes per minute..."""
5,Wild Ride!,"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway is the best Peter Gabriel-fronted Genesis album. A bizzare story is told through the 20-plus tracks on these CDs. With the opening track, you are pulled into a maze of intricate songwriting heard nowhere else in recorded music. It's a nightmarish (at times) trip to the Big Apple with no stops.Just get it if you don't already have it. If you have an old copy, get the new remastered version. Most of the unwanted noise has been removed and the dynamic range has been expanded.DW"
5,ONE OF THE TOP 25 ALBUMS OF ALL-TIME,"If there were a list in the universe of actual merit that named the Top 25 albums of all-time, Genesis' The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway would certainly land a spot on that roster. As with many progressive rock albums there is a tendency for self-indulgence and triteness that undermines its efforts. Not the case with this one. For a double album (2 CD's) The Lamb is solid from the title tracks opening arpeggios to the wonderfully optimistic fade out of 'It'. I first heard this album in 1976 and it immediately became my favorite record period. Genesis spans the broad spectrum of genres in this recording that at first listen is hard to digest. There are hard-rock inflections even ambient influences thanks to Brian Eno as well as jazz oriented movements (thanks Phil) that defy comprehension for the average listener, which you won't be after a listen or two to this outstanding record. There aren't enough stars in the galaxy to rate this masterpiece!"
5,Contemporary Symphony,"Wanna listen a contemporary symphony? Yes those guys ""were"" Mozart of the 20'th century until the ""Duke"" album. Lamb is the most intelligent album of'em. I strongly recommend supper's ready in Foxtrot album too."
1,New mix SUX! The original sounds so much better.,"I just got this, literally like 3 hours ago. I've listened to the entire disc and compared to the CD of the original mastering, this newly mastered mix sucks azz. The fades from song to song are abrubt at best it does not flow. There are MANY things I was hoping to still hear that are not even in the mix anymore. It doesn't even sound like its in stereo for most of the disc. I could go on and on and spend days comparing and citing examples but suffice it to say this is my all time favorite record, ive listened to it at least a thousand times maybe more, I pretty much know it by heart from start to finish and this new mix it just terrible. I'D REALLY LIKE TO RETURN THIS POS. IT SUX! WASTE OF MONEY."
4,where is the 5.1 version ?,"sheduled for the 2004 30th. anniversary of this masterpiece. today i give the album 4 stars and when it finally comes out in 5.1 surround sound i am sure i will give it 5 stars. i just brought the ""video collection"" by genesis, absolut fantasic remastered in 5.1. i can't wait to hear the older genesis albums in surround sound, they truely deserve the widescreen effect in sound like pink floyd and yes. bring it on genesis and get back together, i miss these guys"
3,The beginning of the End.....,"I always looked at The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway the same way you could look at The Beatles ""Let It Be"", or Pink Floyd's ""The Wall""- a very good indication that it was the beginning of the end of some aspect of the band. In this case, it was Peter Gabriel leaving. I think what you have in these situations is just a matter of too much genius in one small space of a band. 4 or 5 incredible musicians, all with incredible ideas as to where they feel the band should be going artistically. This is what I feel reflected in The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway. It's not a ""bad"" album by any stretch of the imagination. The Genesis of that time period couldn't have produced bad music even if they tried. It just seems a little ""lost"" to me. Not cohesive, like their other early works. If you're new to the ""old"" Genesis, this would probably be the last album I would recommend picking up. Go to Foxtrot, Selling England, or even Nursery Crimes, before this one."
3,Not as I had remembered,"I loved this album as a kid because it gave me all kinds of cool sounds to play in my D&D; games with my friends. I am also always attracted to the unique and different.This work is an attempt at a kind of rock opra and the tallent of the guys that did this make it a landmark work in the history of pop music.The amazing thing about this album is how rich the music is with so few instruments and so little effects added. The music itself has many marks of genious.However, the content is void of meaning to me. It is poetic more than functional. If your in a melancholy mood, it makes for good listening, but beware, you might become more depressed!"
4,If ya like prog...,"This is the album for you. It's a concept album about Rael, you goes through different worlds and stuff. It's really weird."
1,Should be titled How to Say it for Stupid Women,"This book is patronizing and outright ridiculous.The author repeatedly drones on about the significance of the character Charlotte from the children's book Charlotte's Web. It's absolute drivel.If your literacy level exceeds the fifth grade, don't waste your money.It's not even worth donating to the goodwill - it's going directly into the trash."
5,Great Advice,"great advice and even excercise on how to change few words in your sentence to give it power, it's simple and yet effective, i recommend this for anyone, not just women who are in managerial positions, it truely changes how you being read!"
3,Not Helpful,"I bought this book at a womens' leadership conference a couple of years ago. I read it cover-to-cover and decided to try the skills covered when communicating in my office. My supervisors' opinions of me changed drastically - they began to view me as surly and defiant. I didn't think any of the verbage alternatives were rude, but in the organization where I was working, the higher-ups expected you to consider them omnipotent and not have an opinion of your own. Ultimately one should consider their audience and adjust their language accordingly."
5,CRUNCHY BUTTERY GOODNESS,"Chick o Sticks remind me a little of the inside of a butterfinger. CRUNCHY, BUTTERY GOODNESS! The thing I really like most about them though is that they're not nearly as sickening-sweet. You can munch on them pretty much all day and not get sick of that over bearing sweetness that makes your mouth feel chalky and dry. They've almost got a nutty flavor to them. I can't really describe it. If you like Butterfinger, minus the chocolate, try a Chick o Stick. I think you'll like them."
1,Sorry CD,"The cd arrived in a very timely manner, but the quality of the music on the cd was really really bad. The cd would not play in my cd player, I had to use my dvd player in order to hear the music. Do not buy this cd."
5,One of the best CD's ever,"This is without a doubt one of the best CD's I've ever purchased. The songs on this album have been on the radio for over twenty five years. I can remmber a 7th grade dance in a poorly lit gymnasium dancing to ""Three Times A Lady"". Each song brings back sweet memories of new or lost love. My five year old even sings along to ""Brick House"" because it reminds him of a Muppet Movie. I would suggest this CD to anyone who likes soft, mellow, love songs from one of the best Motown groups of all time, ""The Commodores""."
3,"Nice accompaniment to ""The Ultimate Collection""","This collection includes the hits ""Sail On"" and ""Oh No,"" which were left out of The Ultimate Collection (1997) but should have been on there. The recording quality of the songs shared with The Ultimate Collection is better in all aspects. But, for those who are looking for all the songs on one collection, look at ""Anthology."""
4,"Interesting, Thoughtful Film","Rising Son is the story of a son seeking indepedence from the dreams his father has for him against the backdrop of the severe recession of the 1980s. Brian Dennehy is in his element as a middle manager in an automotive factory who worked his way up from the factory floor but must face the lost of his career as the plant closes. He dreams of his sons having better lives and pushes them both to have the career he wants for them, whether they do or not. Matt Damon plays Charlie, the son, in one of his earliest roles and does a fine job. Piper Laurie plays the wife and mother trying to keep peace in her house and her family together. A genuinely fine film."
2,Barrons Moron Italian,"After two years of hard fought effort, I was still floundering around unable to speak italian. This program promises much more than it delivers. For example, the end of chapter sentences arent recorded . So there is no way to check your progress. compared to Transparent Language which brings you to speaking advanced levels in only a few weeks, this just barely takes you any place. Too bad, because I wasted SO much time getting very little out of it. I sincerely hope poeple will look elsewhere for italian instruction. CIAO!"
1,Corrupted CDs,"One footnote to the other reviews here is that the CDs included with the course have been corrupted (presumably using the standard trick of corrupting the error-protection data) so that they cannot be played on a PC or on many car CD systems.If, like me, you were hoping to use a PC or iPod for listening to the tracks, that is probably a deal-breaker and I have returned mine to the store."
5,Suggestions that really will make your child feel special,"If you try the suggestions in this book, not only will your child feel special, but you will too. When doing the activities in the book, you will build a closer relationship with your child. These activities remind you of how important it is to spend time with your child and how important it is to recognize your child's individuality. These activities also bring out the creativity and fun in your child.Most of the activities are hands-on...like making things together. Some are about doing things outside, and others are about communicating together. All of them are really great."
5,Great intermediate to advanced coaching book,THis is a wonderful and well rounded book combining information that reaches way beyond the books oriented to first time coaches. I am recommending this to all coaches who want to get serious with their players.
2,Who is it aimed at,Have to say going against most opinions here because I found little use in the book and quite glad I got it as a present and did not pay for it myself. I can see where some people might get some valuable information out of it but my biggest issue was that it couldn't decide if it was directed at the coach new to the game or an intermediate coach moving into coaching 11v11 games (hence little use for anyone coaching over 13's)As the back of the book states the author has coached from 5 year olds to pros and it is obvious that he couldn't decide who to target the book at. Soccer books that try to cover all ages or aspects of the game are not good books
5,an absolute masterpiece,"This is classic Gabriel-era Genesis at its very best, and the best of each band member comes out on this album. The music is melodic and the lyrics are sopisticated and unsurpassed. Dancing with the Moonlit Knight and Cinema Show are my personal favorites. It also signals the debut of Phil's singing talent with More Fool Me.I consider this to be the greatest Genesis album. Oh, how I wish that the classic lineup will someday get back together and tour."
5,Selling England by the pound,"Memories and remembrance of a time when songs where musical pieces, an sketch or a puzzle story that you can almost see as it's been played and sang."
5,Absolutely the best Genesis album.,"Anyone who thinks Invisible Touch was the zenith of Genesis' career is either unfamiliar with the Peter Gabriel era of the band or just plain cracked. This album is so ridiculously underrated that is makes me physically ill. Okay maybe that was a tad dramatic but drama is a given when it comes to Genesis. The only weak track on this album is the one sung by Phil Collins. It seems really out of place. Anyway, this is probably as ambitious and experimental as progressive rock can get and still be accessible. If you are unfamiliar with progressive rock Selling England is a good place to start."
5,Easily the Best Before Gabriel Left,"It's amazing to believe that this same band produced the pulse-pounding beats of later Genesis and Peter Gabriel as a separate act. This album is the best of the heady Genesis period, with wonderfully hummable songs and beautiful arrangements. If Starbucks were to start a 'neglected classics' line, I'd put this on the list of the first ten albums to be released. Superb for wine-sipping on the patio."
5,A Masterpiece,This album is one of the greatest pieces of recorded music ever released. It is the album that broke Genesis in America. One listen will show you why. And why Steve Hackett is the best guitarist ever recorded.
5,This Genesis album rocks!,"This is the best Genesis album with Peter Gabriel. My favorite songs on this album are Dancing With The Moonlit Knight, Firth Of Fifth, After The Ordeal, The Cinema Show and Aisle Of Plenty. I highly recommend this to any Genesis fan!"
3,Underwhelmed,"I'm a progressive rock fan who loves Yes, King Crimson, ELP, UK, the Nice, Rush, etc, to name a few. After years of hearing how great early Genesis is, I settled on this album as a place to start. While the playing of Steve Hackett and Tony Banks is really great when no one is singing, overall the songs are not. Specifically, the songs are pretty standard Genesis pop tunes, with some nice instrumental interludes. In later years they lost the interludes. To be honest, I find Duke and Abacab more listenable than this. I can't really include these guys as progressive rock a la the aforementioned bands just because they have some pretentions towards swords and sorcery type imagery. Oh well, maybe I can edit it down for some of the burning guitar solos and throw out the rest."
2,Is this one of the best prog rock album of the early 70s???,"Well, the fact that so much of the early 70s prog rock music sucks sure doesn't help.Man, this is bad music. ""Bad"", like in overhyped, overplayed, overstated... everything is inflated about this album. And no, it is nowhere near classical music, no matter how many harpsichord and lute sounds you make. Thanks God (for Genesis as a group) Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett eventually left the band -but you had to wait until Duke to really see the results."
4,The more I listen to it the better it gets,"This is a really good cd, although it can be a little hard to listen to at first due to the british accents in it at some places. Best tracks are definitely Fith of firth..excellent long guitar solo on it, dancing in the moonlight knight, and tracks 7 & 8 which are sometime hard to distinguish the ending of 7 and the beginning of 8. The battle of epping forest gets a little ridulous at times but is pretty good."
5,Perfect Morning Workout!,"I was looking for a morning workout that did not require a lot of time and was not overly intense. Denise Austin's Daily Dozen is perfect! Each workout is just 12 minutes, so I can easily fit in 12 minutes before my busy day starts. And, her workouts are challenging without extreme intensity. Perfect for a small morning workout!"
5,Denise Austin: Get Fit Daily Dozen,"Love it! As with all Dennis Austin, I can trust the excercises will be effective, yet safe. I have injured my back and neck in four car accidents, so I can't do all exercises. I like that I can pick whatever day I want to do. I can do Monday and Thursday, Sunday and Tuesday, or do everyday if decide. Great for those who don't have a lot of time to exercise, but would like to get something in. They are quick and effective. Nothing too difficult for a beginner, but challenging enough for an intermediate exerciser as well. Gets the job done!"
5,Denise Austin Daily Dozen,"Denise does it again! These daily dozen 12-minute workouts are great. Who hasn't got just 12 minutes to fit in a quick, but effective workout? She starts you off with a bit of a warmup, then it's on to your great workout. Each day is different for a variety of moves that gets your whole body involved. You'll be telling yourself, ""I could've gone on."""
4,Nice variety - good to combine,This is a nice work-out if you have just a little time or if you want to combine several workouts for challenging intervals and a bigger bang for your buck. The routines are not long enough individually to be boring so the time flies by. You can program the DVD to suit your style. The only reason I didn't give the workout 5 stars is that Denise's queing isn't very good compared to other instructors that I favor. But she's very personable as always and once you do the workouts a couple of times you know what's coming.
5,Denise Austin DVD,I have been working out with Denise for many years. I love her videos and this one is no exception. Great video with different workouts.
3,so-so,What I like: getting a good little workout done in twelve minutes.What I don't like: her backup dancers either didn't come to rehearsal or Denise didn't have any rehearsals with them. They are out of sync and it gets distracting to me. I'm not going to fault the dancers though because Denise sometimes gives unclear directions or says that you only have two reps left and then goes on to do four more. You'd think that after being in this business for so many years and producing so many videos that she'd know how to lead a video by now.
5,very good for short workout days,"I really like this DVD. As a stay-at-home-mom of 2 boys, there are days I can just get in a short workout. If I have more time, I put 2 of the sessions together. So many reviews of Denise Austin say they can't stand her voice. This has the option of working out with her instruction or just with music."
5,I LOVE Denise!,"I literally bought this DVD on a whim when I was in Target and desperately hunting for a cheap workout video. I have only done the DVD about 5 times, but I absolutely love it. I was looking for a workut that I could divide into shorter workouts, or group together for a longer workout, and this is it! The workouts focus on different parts of the body, and the 12 different exercises in 12 min keep it from getting boring. The best part about the DVD is Denise. She is encouraging without being annoying. She seems like such a sweet person, and it helps me get through the exercises. The kickboxing one had me sweating! I love this workout DVD and it has become a daily morning exercise plan for me!"
3,Enough to keep me interested,"I like the cardio athletics and the yoga stretches the most. The cardio kick boxing is a bit fast paced, but a good work out. I do wish the description mentioned I would need hand weights for the upper and lower body sculpt, I was looking for a quick workout that did not require any additional equipment, it was a bit of a surprise. But overall I would recommend it for a quick at-home workout."
4,More difficult than I anticipated,"The concept of this DVD is really good, but I found that some of the work outs are not for beginners. So instead of doing the workout for each day, I often times repeat work outs that I can do. I would say this is a DVD is a beginner to intermediate level."
2,Not Enough Lead In,"I was had high hopes for this video. The ability to mix and match many shorter workouts is exactly what I was looking for. Having said that, I am very disappointed in my inability to keep up with the moves. The moves seem more complex than I am used to and having gone back three times now I am just not getting it. It may just be me. On the positive side I think this instructor has a lot of energy and if I could get the moves down it would be a nice change of pace.For reference I have been doing the body sculpting and cardio workouts from the Biggest Loser people and Jillian for about 10 months now without an issue. I am in reasonably good shape although I will admit to having bad knees."
4,Love this - want to find more videos like it in the future.,The routines leave me wanting just a little bit more after the first few days. Just the right difficulty level for someone who is a little out of shape.
5,What a great concept!,"I always enjoy Denise Austin workouts, because her enthusiasm makes you want to WORK! The concept behind this particular workout is great, because it offers so much versatility. There are options to do quick workouts if you're short on time that day, or you can customize and put several of the quick workouts together. Love it!"
3,Denise Austin: Get fit daily dozen,"I love watching Denise Austin - she always motivates me to get up and exercise and I admire her sunny disposition; however, the dvd is formatted poorly. One has to go through several menus to even start the exercise routines. I have a newer Sony DVD home theater system and have to push the 'ok' button repeatedly to move the dvd through to the exercise portion. I don't know if it's my player or the dvd format, but it is annoying. Once Denise starts the exercise routine, it is fine. You can hear everything well and see the movements. hope this was helpful. Also, the product description said this was released in 2012; when I opened the box, it said 2008. I wasn't very happy about that."
3,"Not bad, but not great","I was looking for an addition to the Leslie Sansone Walk Away the Pounds videos I use just to add variety to those workouts. I do like that you can choose which 12 minute workout you want or combine them to do more. I like the exercises Denise uses and they do give me a variety. However, I think some of them are done too fast to do correctly and some of them you only do a few repetitions before the next one starts. Denise gets off count, says one thing and does another, and makes it kind of hard to follow. It's not a bad workout, but I think Denise is just in a big hurry on this one."
5,Good starter workout,"This is a great DVD for getting back on track. I am 50+, have not worked out regularly for way too long and recently decided to change that. I'm out of shape and undisciplined - this has been a great way for me to ""get my feet wet"" again. It's really hard to convince yourself that you don't have 15 minutes or so to spare for a workout. The workouts are challenging enough to for beginners to get a decent workout in and fun enough to leave you wanting more!"
3,Denise Austin: Get Fit Daily Dozen,I liked the 12 minute idea of workouts but I feel I usually need more but on very busy days this will work.
1,Fitness Video!,"I put a claim in because my package wasn't received.I was suppose to get it by the 23rd of March.I just want my money back.I already got it from going to Best Buy.Not to say I won't order from AMAZON again,but I won't order from this person again!"
3,Charlie Smith is Charlie Smith,"...and not like anybody else. I loved CHIMNEY ROCK, but this didn't hold me as well. Still, love this guy's voice."
2,Over the hill and egotistical camera work,"Nobody can beat Herbert von Karajans' CD recordings of the Beethoven symphonies (1963) for quality of sound and performance in that era. I believe the 1963 CD's are still among the very best recordings of the Beethoven symphonies.The DVDs' made more recently are difficult to watch. Von Karajan looks like a corpse on the podium. The camera shows him in static positions. I haven't viewed the entire set but from what I've seen the orchestra may as well be in another room since they are not shown in the videos.AMAZON needs to learn the way of listing classical music performances. There is NO existing standard which includes the phrase ""...staring...conductor, singer, etc."" STARRING!? This isn't a movie or television program, not theatre. It is classical music in performance. The correct terms include well known things such as ""conductor"" ""________Orchestra/Symphony"" ""Soprano"" etc. There is no such thing as ""STARRING"" in classical music."
3,Where's Beethoven? Give me back my Beethoven baby!,"It is at best Ok, average performance. The delivery of Beethoven music, probably because of BAD camera work is tedious and heavy. Since it is DVD I was expecting for more. I lost track of the music on third minute. If you are looking for great visual experience and Beethoven music seeBeethoven Symphonies 1,2,3,4,5,6 and Art Galleries of the Time, 2DVDs+3CDs Ultimate MosaicDVD CollectionI can listen to the performance, but the visual element is very distracting. To my taste there's some lyricism in Beethoven symphonies. In this Karajan's version it sounds very harsh, straightforward."
1,"Boring, Boring,Boring",I collect books about the Appalachian Trail. This is the only book I have not been able to finish no matter how hard I try. I would give it 0 stars but that is not an option....
5,great recording of Mingus tunes,"This duet album is a set of all Mingus tunes with Steve Lacy on sax, Eric Watson on piano. Lacy to my knowledge never recorded with Mingus, but did participate in many of his big band rehearsals in New York.Lacy is particularly effective on the ballads such as I X Love and Self Portrait, with his beautiful sound.They are very tight on the fast tunes, playing their lines in perfect unison.Of all the recent projects of Mingus compositions, this one stands out with grace and beauty."
4,"good for precision, but range is limited","The roller guide works fine for adjustment, actually better than a very similar one i used on a Makita palm router. It is easy to make very fine adjustments without the guesswork, and the grips permit easy and tight fastening of the guide. The only thing to keep in mind is that the wheel itself is fairly big - you will need a larger router bit to cut more than 1mm. I have a 16mm router bit and my routing limit with this guide is around 5mm."
3,BOSH roller guide,"Not bad product. I used it twice have to get use to it, once you get the hang of it it will be OK."
1,Buy only if browsing the web...everything else crashes it,"The only stable firmware for this product is the 1.01 version. All subsequent firmware releases (1.06, 1.10) are unstable. The nat does not clean up unused tcp connections and will die under heavy loads (heavy being running something such as eMule for more than a day). The router software is extraordinarily inefficient; it cannot juggle streaming media and regular browsing. You must do one or the other, but not both at once. This could probably be an awesome product if there were aftermarket firmware available, but since it is a closed product you must rely on Netgear to fix the bugs, which they seem unwilling to do. Save yourself a headache and create your own firewall with a mini-pc (at least you can change the underlying software!) or get a different product."
1,Netgear Warranty is Meaningless,"I have used Netgear products for many years and they used to work for at least the warranty period. Not so with the current crop of Netgear products. I had been using the FVS114 router for 7 months when it started to frequently drop internet connection. The unit supposedly has a ""lifetime"" warranty. The problem is so severe that I have had to retire the unit. Contacting Netgear for an RMA or technical support is a fruitless task. Don't waste your money on Netgear - buy something else."
1,Very unreliable,"I have tried everything to keep this router up and running for at least 2 days but have not been able to do so. Firmware updates, reboots, restores, nothing will fix the issue that for no apparent reason the router will just cut out and stop working, requiring a power cycle each time. Its 100 Mb WAN port is the only plus I got out of this router so while it was up I could get the full potential of my internet service but this will soon join my old 10 Mb router at the garbage dump as I need a more reliable router then this thing. Seriously every couple hours or so, mulitiple time A DAY the router would cut out so no internet could be accessed or even the configuration page. A big waste of money."
1,No support,"Had trouble setting up a VPN connection, after buying this product AND the Netgear VPN client software. Called Netgear, and they said it would cost $75 to talk to someone for 1 hour, and they could not guarantee resolution. I guess I'll just return both items as ""broken"" because Netgear couldn't take 10 minutes to clear up a configuration issue.And I used to actually like the netgear stuff."
1,Unreliable product and unresponsive customer service,"After less than one week of use, I am forced to return this product due to its inability to maintain a reliable network connection. In 5 days, I have had to cycle power on this unit, on average, more than once per day after it locks up. The Web UI fails to respond to connection requests, it loses the ability to communicate with the internet and the only solution is to cycle power. I have tried to work with NetGear technical support, but their suggestions (e.g., lower MTU) have been useless and their responses quite tardy. If you are looking for a firewall/VPN unit, I suggest you pass on this particular product."
1,I could not get this product to work with my laptop,I could not get this product to work with my laptop! I hired a professional to help me install it and after several hours he finally got it to work with my laptop however I could not use my wifi. I had to be hard wired in. Definitely NOT what I thought I had purchased!
1,Not a good choice,"Beware, if you want to use the VPN you also need to buy the Netgear proprietary software. This is bad - they should include it in the price of the router. I did not realize this when I bought the router, but it does say so if you read the fine print and look at the diagram.However I found the basic DSL PPPoE connection to degrade over a day or so, and require reboot for performance, or it stops, and you are forced to reboot it. So given this, I never spent the extra money to buy their VPN software. I was surprised about this since I used this to replace a Linksys WRT54G which has worked flawlessly for years.(I bought a Linksys RVS4000 instead, and could not get it's VPN going either. Finally I bought a Draytek router, which are hard to find in the US. This is working really well - but not for the amateur - the setup is very sophisticated and needs great expertise. But once you set it up - it works very well, to my relief.)"
4,OK,"Generally OK, but lacking some flexibility in configuring firewall exceptions and has some obscure bugs in the firmware that Netgear has acknowledged to us but not fixed in 6+ months."
3,Marble Sheep - 'Raise The Dead' (Captain Trip) 3 1/2 stars,"Decent live recording of the band - during their 2006 European tour. Thought that the mastering on this Marble Sheep title may not be the best, but still very much acceptable. Saw that some familiar tracks show up here - like the fantastic tripping ""Cement Woman"", the twelve-minute ""Horizon"" and ""Rain"". Then of course I was digging the tunes I'm hearing for the first time - like ""The Drop"" and ""Last Race"". Also noticed they now have a new drummer - Morihide Sawada (ex-Yuri Yuri). Believe I've now listened to (at least) most of the somewhat-easily available Marble Sheep CD's. Saw they had a couple of hard-to-find discs."
5,"Principles of Accounting, with Annual Report",Book used for accounting classes...very complete and thorough. Entertaining and helpful stories and illustrations to help understand concepts.
1,Horrible Book,The authors do not know how to write for non-accountants. This is possibly the worst textbook I have ever had to work with. It is difficult to follow and the explanations is so technically jargoned it is difficult for a novice to accounting to understand. They do not explain things very well.
5,OUTSTANDING & DISAPPOINTING!!!,"It's outstanding because since I purchased this CD in 1996, it has blessed me immeasurably. No matter where I am in this life's journey, the lyrics and music find me and I am immediately engulfed in the Spirit. It's disappointing because this talent has not produced anything (that I am aware of) since this release. Chris, if you hear me, please come out with another release. Your gift is such a blessing and there are thousands perhaps millions who need to be fed by the fruits of your labour.I highly recommend the CD!!!"
5,HOT! HOT! HOT!,"If this CD doesn't light your fire, then your wood's wet! Equisitly produced. Beautiful, soulfully passionate, Holy Spirit-turbo blasted and at times tender. Boost your spirit, buy this one and get fired up! You'll not be the same."
3,Not very funny spoof,"This is a spoof of the Dr. Who series, made as a fund-raiser for Comic Relief. It stars several British comedy veterans: Rowan Atkinson (Blackadder); Julia Sawalha and Joanna Lumley (Absolutely Fabulous); Jonathan Pryce (as the Master); Oscar nominee Jim Broadbent, and Hugh Grant. The story itself is pretty lame and not very funny, though it's interesting to see Joanna Lumley as a female Doctor. Jonathan Pryce was especially good, but Rowan Atkinson was disappointing. The Daleks also make an appearance. Most of the video is devoted to interviews with the stars and creators about how the show was made. This tape is for die-hard Dr. Who collectors only."
2,The Curse of Fatal Editing,"The earlier reviews posted here have pretty well covered the merits of the plot, but a brief note is needed on the technicalities, as this story has been re-edited for video.When it was shown on television, ""The Curse of Fatal Death"" was in four parts, each one ending in a cliffhanger. But BBC Video, always happy to throw in a spoiler where it can, has chosen for no good reason to pointlessly spoil this story by re-editing it into a 2-parter.So do be aware that this video is not what was presented on television."
2,Parody very short in length,"The parody, 'Curse of Fatal Death', is only about 15 minutes long! The rest of the video is dedicated to how the parody was made which, in my opinion, was boring and tedious. There are three other parodys of Dr. Who at the end of the tape (about 5 mintues each) which are Ok. Although Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant are seen in the spoof, I was very disappointed that there wasn't much substance in the parody. The skit is well made, using some orginal Dr. Who visual and audio effects and music, but not enough substance. I probably would not have purchased 'Curse of Fatal Death' if I knew how short it would be."
4,Suffering from a case of Fatal Death?,"Well this might just be your video! Rowan Atkinson plays the Doc kinda like a gentler Black Adder. Very funny and the series of big name cameo regenerations at the end makes the tape that much funnier. Behind the scenes show follows the main feature. As an added bonus there are 3 comedy sketches from various British shows. The French and Saunders skit was kind of goofy (thus the 4 stars instead of 5....not quite perfect), but seeing Lenny Henry do a sort of Doctor mixed with Shaft routine is hilarious. In summary....DEFINITELY lives up to WHO name."
4,DR WHO- Curse of the Fatal Death,"Dr Who-Curse of the Fatal Death proves the Doctor Who is alive and well in the 21st century. Although a parody, Curse of the Fatal Death stays true to Doctor Who characters and events. Starring Rowan Atkinson, Johnathan Pryce and Hugh Grant, this video is one of the funniest takes on the DR. WHO mythos I've ever seen. Done for Comic Relief, Fatal Death will be a welcome addition to any DR. WHO library or make a great gift for any Whovian."
1,Way too broad.,"Didn't realize it when I bought it, but it's too broad to be useful. I think you can get most of this information online, and it's heavy, big, and just not like other Rough Guides, which get down and dirty with bus times, rail schedules and quirky things about little towns you'd miss otherwise. Skip it and buy a few extra beers with the money you've saved."
3,Good book for the individual traveller,"It is a good book that gives travellers very useful information about each European country,which is what many people are looking for. As the same time, there is a lack of information on the travelling link between each country.I am really looking forward to use this book in my next travel to the south of Europe in the Spring"
4,From the stable of Shaun Tan,"Although this book (and some of the other creations by Shaun Tan) as often billed as a book for children, it is enjoyable for anyone. And with Shaun at the helm of the artwork, it's worth buying for that reason alone - gorgeous pictures. A nice read but perhaps not his best work."
5,Amazing illustrations that make you feel,"A very nice book. Very simple and yet leave you a lot of roomfor imaginations. I just love the illustrations and I can lookat those pictures again and again. It's a book not just for kids,it's actually more for adults I think. You can apply the littlestory to a lot of things and it's that universal. I felt prettygood after I read the book."
2,"book was good but,","this is second purchase of the book 'the red tree' cause I lost one I used to have.I was happy to have the book even though that wasn't the original hard cover.the only problem is that, I got this book almost 15 days after ordering it. More over, the quality of thebook was so bad. The book was totally dammaged by water and all wrinkled.I could not open the pages because they were attached to one onother.Thank you for sending the book but I am disappointed by the quality. Please send me a new replacement."
1,Entering the darkness with hope,"I have found this an excellent book for myself on 'darker days'and to use with adults who may need some help to access painful or dark feelings, depression etc.The illustrations are particularly open-ended, offering imagery and symbol as a 'way in'. The text never 'gets in the way' and its sparseness is a gift...the story is within."
5,Excellent book illustrating depression,"As someone who has anxiety and chronic depression, the pictures in this book express the reality of my feelings. I can now open up to a certain page and tell my husband, ""I feel just like this picture,"" and he begins to understand. The pictures portray feelings and emotions superbly. The text helps a bit by getting your mind thinking about what emotions are being shown in the illustration. If you are someone with depression, or know someone with depression, this book can help with the communication that words sometimes can't explain."
4,Jazz and rock,"This debut album Yes was the only Yes vinyl album I hadn't been able to track down anywhere, so when I got the chance, I paid as much as $50 for it. Just to complete my Yes collection.At first, I was kinda disappointed. But this album gains credit with time. And you end up really appreciating it - not only because of the affectional value but also for the music itself.Especially Side One is very jazzy. I See You is an absolutely great jazz song, full of soul and Yesness! In fact, every single track is very worth listening to. And Jon Anderson's voice in its youth is very fragile yet very very beautiful and skilled.On the back of the cover, it says: (...) My second runner in the Great Group-Most-Likely-To-Make-It Stakes. And my money is on them! (...) (Tony Wilson, Melody Maker).You bet!(Oh, by the way, Sweetness is used in Yes freak Vincent Gallo's movie Buffalo 66 starring Christina Ricci. Support Yes, watch it!)"
1,Didn't work very well.,"This item did not work very well for me. It is a really neat idea for a product and it might work better for others. First of all, the picture shown is not what the item looked like. It is simmilar, but it is not the same. I could never get it to work real well. After some adjusting of the frequency it did work better, but I still do not like to listen to static. I had to return the item because it did not work well enough in my car. It seemed like the signal was just not strong enough."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!,"When I first purchased this FM Transmitter I thought it worked awesome. But then it started messing up. I have used this in my car for my Mp3 player. Let me just list a couple of things that have happened to me- the on/off button sticks in one position or the other either making this unusable or simply drains the batteries no matter what you do.- Also, when the button does seem to let you use it, the wires inside of the cable are broken. Rendering the sound to be terrible.This transmitter is actually only a couple of weeks old and the store that I bought it at will not take it back so I had to throw it away and am forced to look for a new one."
2,not good,"The range it transmits is good, reach 10+ meters.<br />But mine has a little problem, the left channel doesn't work and I have to exchange the item...<br /><br />With the only working right channel, the sound quality is very good."
1,DO NOT BUY - PIECE OF CRAP,"(...) I took my personal MP3 player and turned it on to play in my car, then I plugged in the SILink while the SILink was turned on. When I plugged it into the headphones port, my MP3 player just shut itself off. Then I unplugged the SILink, and my MP3 player just was totally messed up. It didn't turn on for about 30 minutes, and when I finally got it to turn on, everything was messed up - none of the buttons work anymore on it except the ""play"" button. So I tried it again, only I had the SILink off when I plugged it in. The instant I turned it on my MP3 player just shut down. (...)"
3,It's different,"I bought Riviera the day it came out on a Nintendo system, because I knew that it would have a limited print run. I was right - a month after Riviera came out, I could not see it anywhere. This PSP game gives people who waited too long to try to grab the copy they missed.Riviera is a game filled with choices. Do I spend time looking for treasure, or do I move on? The time spent on even mundane decisions affects what happens in the game. For the optimist, it gives a feeling of adventure. For the pessimist, it feels like every decision made in the game could have been wrong. I found myself doing every level twice just to see what happened if I changed my decision. The originally didn't appeal to me, but it is an okay anime RPG."
4,Great Game,i like the story line and the plot but the only reason i wouldnt give it a five star rating is because of how hard it is to skill up. Once you've skilled up with all your weapons its hard to come across new weapons.
2,what a kid game,"well this game is a total let down because it is so easy and there are no cinematic scence just all pictures, but funny how it is dialogue through out the game though. it is a pretty straight forward game and no need a strategy guide or so whatever. i was disappointed with this game and expectly a game with a map to explore, but instead, the game proceed one scence after another. i won't pay over 20 dollars for this game, but guess what it's too late."
1,"Not your regular RPG, amigos...","I bought this game, because I thought the graphics were awesome and the battles were pretty cool. The game's got a lot of dialogue and sound effects, but I did not like it.Even though I am an avid RPG fan, this game is just slow and really palys like one of those pop-up books in a story you follow through with not many choices to make, but to see where the story leads fighting battle after battle.I don't recommend this game for new gamers or old ones. It was a complete deception for me. Sorry, big fans, I'm hard core, but not THAT hard core to the point of complete boredom!"
5,"Worth the price of admission for Guaraldi's ""Macedonia""","This short-but-accomplished album is a beautiful slice of vintage West Coast jazz. As a Vince Guaraldi aficionado, I'm particularly glad to have his only extant recording of ""Macedonia,"" an early Guaraldi composition that stands among his best."
5,A hit with twin boys!,This thing is fantastic. Our boys love it! They play for hours on it. The best thing about it is it has 2 seats 2 stearing wheels and 2 hats so no fighting! Not to difficult to put together and the boys just played in the box while they waited. FYI I would suggest using a drill to put the screws in it would be a lot easier. Also the box is huge so make sure you have a lot of room to bring it home.
4,A Nice Collection of Articles,"This book is a collection of articles, with accompanying advertisements, from ""Jaguar Enthusiast"" magazine. It covers the major areas from body work, to suspension, to engine, drive train, and exhaust.I used this book more as a guide to the steps that must be completed. It is not a detailed account of each overhaul. When accompanied by a Jaguar Repair Operation Manual and a Jaguar Parts Catalog, you wind up with almost all of the documentation you need.Note: This car is most helpful for restoring Jaguar Series I, II, and III cars built from the early '70s through the late '80s. Though some of the information may be useful, this book does not cover newer models of the XJ40 and beyond."
5,Maglite when only the best will do.,"I need lots of light for work at night on the road, this flashlight combined with a LED bulb is just what I needed."
1,Unfortunately never worked...,"I was excited to get this light especially because of the good reviews. I guess I got a fluke because every bulb I put in it blows out instantly, including the two it came with. I never heard back from Amazon and now it's outside the return time frame so I guess I'm sol..."
3,Non-liner notes an insult to the music,"I'm going to be less forgiving about the non-liner notes. The music is close to impeccable but the explanation of having no liner notes because ""the brain will write its own liner notes"" is an absolute insult to the buyer/listener and, more significantly, to the artists and the music on this disc. To suggest that this music, as moving as it is, does not deserve any serious scholarship is indefensible. You may as well burn someone else's copy because there's absolutely no information to be gleaned from the packaging."
4,Close to the Edge's Evil Twin,"The only thing this album has in common with CTTE is that it has 3 songs- one epic and 2 shorter pieces. I have to agree that this is Yes's harshest sounding album. ""The Gates of Dellium"" is Anderson at his most direct lyrically, though the mood peacefully changes like a breath of fresh air at the ""Soon"" finale. Steve Howe's guitar solo on ""Sound Chaser"" is eerie, while Patrick Moraz features spacey jazz fusion on the keyboards. Meanwhile Squire and White bash it out on the bass and drums, respectively. ""To Be Over"" is a more peaceful but still moody track."
4,"Another ""Close to The Edge"" almost !","This album featured Alan White in his 2nd stint on a studio album and new keyboardist Patrick Moraz . The album was set up like CTTE with one long piece on side one (vinyl) and 2 shorter pices on side 2. ""Gates"" was the epic that was based on another epic, ""WAR AND PEACE"". and featured the hauntingly beautiful ""Soon"" section. ""Sound Chaser features Howe in a mind-boggling guitar showcase, and culminates with Moraz's fiery synth. The final track, 'To Be Over' has a wonderful fugue intro that leads into some classic YES harmonies, stellar steel guitar and majestic synthesizer work. Throughout. the bass is excellent, and WHITE/SQUIRE prove themselves a team that history has shown is one of the tightest rock rhythm sections in existence."
5,Music for alien wars.,"An absolute masterpiece.""Gates of Delirium"" is the most compelling piece of music I have ever heard. The final sounds of life departing, that fills the ears of dying soldiers in the battlefield of aTolkien world. Thats the kind of images that this masterpiece brings to my mind. And I guess that the cover of the cd is not far away from this image.Patrick Moraz's keyboards is the best thing ever happened to Yes and its a shame that he only stayed only for this work.I always prefered his more intelectual approach than the pompous victorian approach of Wakeman.In any case this album is a prog rock gem and possibly the most consice album ever conceived by Yes."
3,Proto-Spinal Tap,"I love Yes. I love Spinal Tap. But I love them differently. I think that Spinal Tap's Jazz Odyssey is based on this album. That is not necessarily a good thing. But I do find this album fascinating in an over-the-top, train-wreck, Showgirls-esque so-bad-it's-hypnotic sort of way. Not the place to start if you only know Owner of a Lonely Heart."
2,Ridiculous excess,"I really like quite a bit of Yes's 70s output, even the oft-maligned ""Tales From Topographic Oceans"", but this is just too over-the-top pretentious, even for Yes. ""The Gates Of Delerium"" has five interesting minutes out of twenty-plus (""Soon"", at the very end of the song), ""To Be Over"" is unmemorable, and ""Sound Chaser"" is, quite frankly, unlistenable, a practically atonal unfocused mess, with Steve Howe achieving possibly the most jarring and irritating guitar tone in rock history on his solo. Skip this one."
3,Typical Yes,"I wonder why almost all the reviews sent to Amazon are hyperbolic. No matter what the album or the band is, everything is superb, the best, unsurpassed, the top, you have to get it, etc. Well, Relayer is a normal Yes album, some sections are good, some boring, some noisy. The lyrics, as always, combine pretty well with the music but in general, meaning something obscure or directly nonsensical. Typical Yes."
3,"A little too over the top if you ask me, but most is good","I know Yes fans call this one of their best albums, if not their best album, but I'm just not getting it. For one, I far prefer Close To the Edge to The Gates of Delirium, and I've never seen the big deal about it. It is a good song, but it could have been cut, and the ending isn't moving, at least in my humble opinion. Side two is worse, with Sound Chaser being one of my least favorite Yes songs. If you love the crazy sounds of King Crimson, or Zappa's weirdest material (such as ""Burnt Weeny Sandwich""), you may love this song. I don't. To Be Over is nice, but it is a feeble attempt to recreate the majestic And You And I. I get bored about four minutes in. So this is a small improvement over ""Tales From Topographic Oceans"", but you have to have very specific tastes to fully enjoy it. ""Relayer"" isn't bad though."
4,Relayer - another magnificent oldie,"I bought Relayer, after succumbing to Topographic Oceans, as soon as it was released in the mid-70's. It's a hard album to follow, especially the first 'side' which has a wonderful contrast of styles, volumes and complexities. The final quiet section ""Soon oh soon the time..."" has remained one of my all time favourite pieces of music. I recently rebought it on CD, my Vinyl version having been almost worn out, and the magic remains. I regularly play it charging up the M3 from Poole to Farnborough. Brilliant. Is there anyone else on the M3 doing likewise? (Nick in Poole)"
3,Better with Age,"I bought this album when it was released. I was 16 and I didn't like it. It wasn't appealing to a 16 year-old Yes fanatic. I brought it out 2 years ago and was blown away by the complexity and grandeur of the music on this album. 24 years has mellowed me enough to enjoy the many facets of this work. From the concert-opening attack of ""Sound Chaser"" to the quiet, reflective strains of the end of ""Relayer"", this album begs for a return engagement. The addition of Patrick Moraz is a wonderful fit: like an exact mix of Wakeman and Kaye. His work with the Moody Blues is pure genius IMHO. I'm sending the wife and kids to Grandma's and firing this one up again."
1,Maybe I just don't get it,"I first heard of Ben Harper while watching a documentary about MoTown and the influence of the Funk Brothers. Ben Harper was one of the singers used to sing with the remaining band members. His voice on these songs was crystal clear, resounant, and powerful. I thought, ""I need to get a CD by this guy."" Well, this boxed set is a disappointment. He whispers through the songs in a soft voice. I listened to it once, and not since. His voice just was not featured in this album. I admit, maybe I just don't get it. I will give it another try, but for now, this album was a big letdown for me."
4,cute book,"this book is very small - about 5"" x 7"". the pages unfold in creative ways and the story is cute. beautiful illustrations."
2,"extremely tiny, hard to read and hard to see images","Wonderful book, the text is great if you are able to see the mini print, i used a magnifying glass to read it. Nowhere did it say that this book was tiny thats why i bought it. Im so upset!"
3,Love the book but don't like the size,"My son saw this book at someone's home and loved reading it. The book I saw at this person's home was a normal sized book. So when I searched for it on Amazon and saw this, I bought it but was disappointed when it arrived. The story is, of course, great but the size of this book is not. It is tiny. And this book has things that pop out and open, so when you put that in such a tiny sized book, it is very difficult to read and not as enjoyable as it should be. The physical size of the book needs to be much larger.I would not have bought it had I known it was this tiny!"
2,Disappointment..,"I was disappointed when I received this book in the mail. I ordered two of Eric Carle's books from this vendor and while they were delivered in a timely fashion that I was pleased with, they were definitely not what I expected. Instead of being the regular sized, hardback books that I see at Books-A-Million or Barnes and Noble, they are miniature versions of the books and they are tiny. I planned to give a set of the Eric Carle books to my nephew for Christmas, but now I am going to have to go out and purchase more books that are a normal size because he hates tiny books. He likes to see the big, pretty pictures. I am very frustrated and hate that I wasn't given an accurate description of the size of the books before making my purchase."
2,DISAPPOINTED IN THE SIZE,"THE STORY WAS EXCELLENT,MY CHILDREN LOVED IT, I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE SIZE OF THE BOOK."
3,Very small book,"I love Eric Carle, and still do. I also love this story. However, I seem to have not looked at the dimensions of the book, it is tiny!!"
1,The Amazon.com website did not state that this book was not a regular size book.,"I love this book, but I expected to receive a regular size book for my grandson. This book is only 3 inches in length. I want a regular size copy of 'Papa, Please Get the Moon for Me.'"
3,Extra small,"We bought this because we had checked the dilapidated version out of the library over and over and our kids love it. The big version is very cool because it is huge with all the fold outs etc... I didn't notice when ordering it the diminutive dimensions, just the selection of hardcover or board book. Well since we wanted the fold outs it did not seem like the board book was what we wanted we just didn't expect it to be a quarter of the size of the book our kids fell in love with. It is still a great book, but kind of a let down to not be able to find the one we really wanted to get."
5,It's Eric Carle - of course it's great!,My kids (ages 4 and 6) love all of Eric Carle's books and have since I can remember. All of his books are must-haves for the reading collection.
5,another beautiful active book from Eric Carle,"Author Eric Carle (The Very Lonely Firefly, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, The Very Busy Spider) excels in creating books that offer children more than words on a page -- he consistently incorporates additional elements (lights, holes(!), textures) that make the books even more interesting to thirsty little minds.In this book, a smaller portable version of the original, a girl asks her father for the moon. Fold-out pages complement Carle's unique illustrative style as we discover a looooooong ladder that reaches to the moon and back, and a magnificent four-page center spread revealing the full moon in all its glory.This fantastic tale for young children is sure to delight parents and kids."
1,Disappointed,"I thought I was getting a full-sized book, but instead I received this teeny-tiny mini book that is so small I don't see what the purpose of having it is. I don't remember seeing anywhere that the book would be 2 "" X 3"" - so just a warning to anyone who thinks they are ordering a normal book."
3,Not one of his best,"This book is very sweet, but it isn't as catchy as some of his better ones. Very little kids definitely won't like it as much as The Very Hungry Caterpillar (holes to put their tiny fingers through), and the fold out part is vulnerable to toddler damage."
3,misadvertised,The book was listed as a hard covered book. It did not say that it was a mini book. The child was very disappointed. Amazon did give me a $10 credit but I have to look for the proper sized book elsewhere.
1,"Papa, Please Get Me the Moon","Very diapppointed. Cheap, tiny little book, not even a board book which I thought I was buying. This is not up to Eric Karl's usual standards. It looked like something that you would buy at the ""Dollar Store""."
1,This is a BOARD book...,"I was expecting a hard cover, large book like one you would find at the library... Instead it is about 6 inches tall and 5 inches wide board book (some pages extends a small amount) and it looks nothing like the book I checked out at the library that my 2 year old adored. I think the product should include this information so customers are not misled. The book I wanted has extendable ladders when ""papa"" gets the moon, and this book doesn't include this. I am very disappointed."
4,"Papa, Please Get the Moon for Me",This is a very imaginative and educational book that also touches upon a father's love for his child. Very calming illustrations as well. A great concept.
2,Need a magnifying glass,"Classic book but I was shocked when I got it and found that it is ""pocket"" sized. I could hardly read it and it certainly wasn't big enough to engage my two year old son. Thanks for the no hassle return Amazon!"
4,Bring back the bigger size version!,"My son adores this book but I was surprised to find that it's a miniature book. I was rather disappointed when I looked back at what is sold on Amazon to find that this and a board book are the only versions available. It's rather hard to read and the details are not as enjoyable when it's so small.It's a very cute story and we love all the foldouts. He loves the moon so it's great to have this and compare with the full moon when it's visible.I suppose the 4""x6"" size is great for travel but I'd prefer a regular sized book."
2,teeny tiny,"I don't believe it states anywhere in the description that this would be a 2"" by 3"" book -- what a disapointment when I opened the box!"
3,A Good Story,"This is a good story by Eric Carle. I would have given it 5 stars but the format of the book is awkward. The first time we read the book , the lift- open pages tore. When we tried to unfold the large page that represents the full moon, it tore and was hard to refold correctly so that the book would close completely. Even though the lift-up pages have arrows pointing the direction in which to lift them, they are still hard to open. We love the story but the book is awkward to handle."
2,Small book,"I thought I was getting the full size book and I ended up with a tiny 4x6 book. The story is great, but I am disappointed in the size of the actual book. I did not see anywhere on the listing that it was so small."
1,There was an error in the binding of this book!,"So, I got this book in the mail and put it on the shelf. When it was time to read it, we started reading and then came to several pages that were upside down and our book had missing pages! The book itself looks very cool with all of the fold-out pages, but it's worthless to us when the missing pages make the story senseless!"
2,Papa can you get the moon for me?,This book was so much smaller than I was expecting. I thought it would be a full sized hard cover children's book.
1,Also disappointed,"Like a previous customer, I saw the description ""hardcover"" and thought I was ordering the large book. I was disappointed to receive a tiny version of the book. I wish the size was described next to the title. Great gift for a baby shower though."
2,nice story but too flimsy for little ones,I bought this for my 3 yr old grand daughter. It was very small and not what I expected in quality fron an Eric Carle book. The story itself was a nice story but I'm sure the book did not last long. Would I have purchased it if I had actually seen it. NO
2,Wonderful concept poorly implemented,"I bought this book for my 11-month son who is very hard on regular books. Unfortunately, he will not get to read it until he is much older because the fold-out pages are much too flimsy for a board book.I was very disappointed to bring it home from the store and have the page with the moon that unfolds tear just from me opening those two pages.The book is very very pretty, I just wish it were more durable. I don't see how a child could avoid damaging it."
3,Just wanted to point out...,"That this is the mini version of the book :) I'm writing this review just in case there's another impulsive shopper out there (like me) that doesn't check the dimensions of the book before purchasing. This is a very small version and while still an amazing and interactive book, it's just not as much fun as the larger version. I returned this one immediately and purchased the larger version."
1,Was good but....,Hi: the book is upper great....but....I never image that will be small size....I thought will be regular size....I am working with special kids and I am using it ...only doing one by one ...because the size donn't gave me another option...thank you anyway to asked me for the review...:)
1,Another BBC screw-up,"The BBC can't do anything right! First and foremost they cancelled Doctor Who, now they can't even release it on video properly. For some reason (incompetence, most probably) they placed, not the original pilot episode, but the actual first episode of an Unearthly Child as it originally aired. The tapes have been pulled from retailers and are being replaced with the proper episode. How long this will take, no one knows. Another big disappointment for North American Who fans. DON'T buy this tape until you're positive you know what you're getting"
5,great stuff,"""The Edge of Destruction"" with it's minimal set is still more entertaining than a number of Doctor Who stories--a lot of mood swiings for the actors and suspense for the viewer. ""The Missing Years"" tape is interesting, with quite a few clips not released on earlier videos. Contrary to some dour critcs who apparently take Doctor Who a little too seriously, I think ""The Underwater Menace"" episode is a riot--a lot of fun, manic acting and high energy, and a pretty impressive ""underwater"" sequence, despite a couple shots featuring the suspended actor's heavy black truss wire. Made me wish more early missing episodes are found and released."
5,Great episode,"A previous reviewer mentioned he wished they had included the Missing Years video with this. Well, it is. The package includes Edge of Destruction, the original unaired pilot (once they fix the mistake anyway), and the Missing Years on a separate tape.As for the episode itself, despite the fact they never leave the TARDIS, it is spectacular."
3,Stupid Idea,The story is good however packaging it with the pilot episode which had already been released on the Hartnell tape was stupid. It would have been better if they had released Edge of Destruction with the Missing Years tape or the remaining episodes of The Reign of Terror.
5,He Was There,"An excellent book by a man who actually witnessed the events he recounts. Considered by many to be the peak of the Stones' performing career, their 1972 tour of America certainly deserved to be covered in detail and Mr. Greenfield did so. He was also filing regular reports for Rolling Stone magazine during the tour and these are paraphrased throughout. The book would have been better if he had used the original material from RS, but this is a minor quibble. It's a must-have for anyone wanting to read about the Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band In The World at the height of their powers. And the recently released DVD of the superb 72 tour movie Ladies And Gentlemen The Rolling Stones is another must-have for any Stones fan."
2,A disappointment,"I bought this book in the hope that it would contain actual implementation details concerning the various methods; specifically prismatic and other unstructured methods. To say the least, this book is thick but it is filled with extraneous fluff without any real details. For instance, the chapter on prismatic grid generation is nothing but a lot of ""hand-waving"" without any concrete details and I can say the same concerning the rest of the book.Also, it appears that many of the chapters in the book were included without a strict peer-review process as should be the process for a book of this type."
3,Docking Station,Good to watch in bed while my wife is asleep. It doesn't give off to much light to keep her awake. Also is very stable. Now I don't have to hold my PSP in bed anymore. Remote only works well if close to sensor. After reading reviews it comes with carrying case and 3ft cord for gaming. I didn't receive either one. I got gipped. Lucky for me I didn't really have to have those so why bother to go through the hassle with seller. But great to have.
5,Simply.....,"GREAT!!! And you people out there who have this and is running EXTREMLY SLOW! All you got to do to fix that is the following steps:1. Insert Disk 12. Choose the setup3. Look at the bottom of the editer4. You should see the Numbers 10,20,30, and 605. Set to 306. Look on the next thing above that7. turn off the shadow'sIt is that easy to setup it is also great so have fun playing Sonic Heroes PC!"
4,Sonic Heroes is a fun game for any die-hard Sonic fan.,Not bad at all. This game makes a nice addition to my slowly growing collection of Sonic game titles. Keeps somewhat of a good frame-rate on my Nvidia GeForce 8400 GS graphics card. I would recommend this to any die-hard Sonic fan out there.
2,Camera glitch?,"Okay, I bought this thing at Gamestop for $4... I love Tails, so I thought I was getting a good deal. So I install and everything and try to get it to run with my Lik-Sang adapter, set up all the buttons the way I want, and I try playing... and the stupid camera WON'T stop panning in circles. This is the most anoying thing in the world, how are ya sposed to jump platforms with a constantly spinning camera angle? Maybe I should just break down and actually get a Gamecube to play the game... >_<"
1,Sega Sonic Heroes,"This is a really fun game, but after only 6 weeks, it already has a technical problem that makes it unplayable. Sega support was courteous but unhelpful--they eventually just referred us to the warranty."
1,Not a good math textbook for instruction,"From the actual use of this textbook, I have found that this textbook does not work well with my students."
3,decent,"i only kept cd 1 cuz it's not as old school. There are some good tracks on the album, should give you the idea of fillmore, san francisco sound. One thing though, i discovered one of my favorite north cali rappers.......Messy Marv. As the Source magazine claims, this guy IS a legend in the Yay. Go get his album ""disobayish"", you won't be disappointed."
5,great battery,"I bought one of these...and it works great. I can go for a week or more depending on how much I use the phone to talk without the battery going out on me while traveling.Plus, it is about half the weight of the extended life battery I used before this. This is the battery to buy if you want an extended life battery."
4,I like the extra capacity but not the extra size,"I like the extra capacity of this battery, the extended standby time and the extended talk time. I also like the price versus performance. It fits okay on the belt clip. However, it doesn't fit in the standard Nokia car holster kit, and it fits albeit loosely in a third-party generic phone holster, I'm concerned it might not stay in place through sudden stops or jolts. Good only if you really need the extra capacity, and the fact that it costs less than the standard Nokia battery."
1,Doesn't live up to the hype,"This battery didn't last any longer than the factory-supplied battery. I left it on overnight with about 75% of a charge remaining. When I woke up in the morning, the battery was completely dead! Also, as others have said, the battery is too big to fit easily in a cell phone case, in a pocket, in a purse, etc."
2,Disappointing,"Fine layout and photographs, but I found this book oddly uninteresting to read.There are better books out there covering the same ground. One book I like, less exhaustive but more interesting to read, is ""100 Easy to Grow Native Plants."" If you want something more exhaustive, Cullina's two books on Wildflowers and Shrubs are IMO the best native plant guides on the market."
3,Does Not Stay Together Well,"Like all of the GI Joe and Tonka Lego-compatible sets, there are plenty of special pieces not found in other sets. The directions are pretty clear, but do not use the Lego/Mega Blok standard of highlighting the new pieces. The set also includes a fully posable figure (knees, elbows, ankles, wrists, hips, shoulders, and neck).The design of this rescue vehicle is rather fun with its mobile ice pick that can convert into a launching grappling hook.The one problem I found is that the arm assembly tends to keep popping off of the base. The assembly has a square piece centered on a large flat base that tends to flexThis should be a fun toy but parents should be aware that it has an arm that strikes out at the push of a button."
1,Cottage cheese!,"For the price it was worth it but when I finally use it it looked like cottage cheese, thick and no shine.. Don't purchase from this seller.. Extremely disappointed.."
5,Why pay more?,This a great bargain. If you have leather furniture in you car and house then you need a lot of this stuff. Shipping was super fast. Very happy!
2,ehhhhh,"Its upbeat which is fine, for a party or background beach bar music. Its not what I thought it would be. Amazon recommeded it and thats why I bought it. Amazon and I are still getting to know one another..."
2,Ultimate Collection,"While I do like reggea music, I do not like Jimmy Cliff. I DO like the Bob Marley CD I ordered very much~~~"
3,"too clean for my tastes . .. (or as I tell my peers ""too much 'carlton' in the mix )","Do you remember carlton from ""fresh prince of bel air"" ???. this cd sounds like music he would listen to .just check out ""You Can Get It If You Really Want It"" (track 6). Ahh.. I can see carlton snapping his fingers right now. I prefer reggae with a bit more soul .While there were 3-4 very good tracks on this cd , the rest I could have lived without . Notable tracks were ""many rivers to cross"",""sitting in limbo"" ,""bongo man"" and ""sooner or later"" .This cd really turned me off of Jimmy Cliff . I had heard he was a legendary reggae artist , and I've been disapointed by what this compilation has to offer. For those of you seeking a more soulful and ""earthy"" reggae experience , I would recommend Toots & The Maytals ."
4,"FINALLY- A ""VERY BEST OF"" FOR ONE OF REGGAE'S FINEST","I MANAGE A MUSIC STORE, SO I GET TO LISTEN TO ALL THERE IS OUT THERE FOR FREE. SO IF I ACTUALLY BREAK OUT THE CASH TO BUY ONE, IT'S WORTH IT. I'M NOT REALLY A REGGAE FAN, BUT I LOVED THE MOVIE ""COCKTAIL"", WHICH CONTAINS JIMMY'S ""SHELTER OF YOUR LOVE"". THAT SONG IS NOT ON THE SNDTRK, OR ANY OTHER CD STILL MADE, UNTIL THIS ULTIMATE COLLECTION. I POPPED IT IN THE PLAYER EXPECTING TO FIND TWO SONGS I KNEW, AND WOW. THAT WAS JIMMY..? HE SANG THAT? THERE ARE SONGS ON THERE FOR EVERYONE. FROM THE HARD HITTING ""VIETNAM"" TO ""I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW"" TO ""WILD WORLD"" THIS IS A VERY GOOD SLOW JAM CD. GRAB A BEER, TURN THE LIGHTS DOWN AND PREPARE FOR THAT LIGHT EASY GOING, LAID BACK FEELING TO TAKE OVER. AND I'M TELLING YOU MAN, THESE DAYS WE DON'T ALL GET TO EXPERIENCE THAT FEELING OFTEN. THIS IS A GOOD STRESS RELIEVING CD, BUT IT'S NOT TOO MELLOW, SO IT WON'T PUT YOU TO SLEEP. DEFINITELY WORTH CHECKING OUT. YOU CAN TRUST A PROFESSIONAL OPINION."
5,A Beautiful Album,"This is one of the most uplifting, beautiful music experiences out there. I recommend that anyone with a love of music purchase this album. Even if your not usually a fan of reggae music, this is an incredible album. There is not a song on it that you will want to skip over. I have my favorites, but there are no bad songs to be found here."
2,"lifeless recordings, anything but 'ultimate'","flat, lifeless recordings, anything but an 'ultimate' collection.have heard so much better recordings of jimmy's work.wish had pre-listened."
2,Fun book!,"This book has lots of fun stuff to create, esp. animals. However, the instructions are not clear! I have lots of origami books, but this one by far has the worst instructions. Sometimes it's hard to see the diagrams too. On the diagram for the snail in step 1, the instructions and the picture are different. Also, some of the instructions are not clear about which end of the diagram should be facing up. This book could be written a lot better!"
2,"Spotty performance, unreliable construction","When I purchased the MiniSync for my Rio Carbon I was immediately impressed with how well constructed it seemed, as well as the beautiful functionality of the retractible cord and the fact that data transfer and charging could be attained through such a small, strong wire.However, the cable soon proved to have inconsistent results with different USB ports, as my Carbon would not be detected by over half the computers I tried using this cable with. Add to that disappointment the fragility of the plastic surrounding the 'spindle' resulting in breakage preventing the cable from retracting and I can no longer recommend this product.I didn't discover these flaws until the 100-day warranty had expired, and the best BoxWave would do to help me was give me a 25% off coupon towards the purchase of another MiniSync cable. It's possible they've improved their design by now."
5,The Morning after The Jungle Prom,"Sam Woodruff is dead,and Bruce Patman's life is saved by Pamela Robertson,from Big Mesa,when the Big Mesa guys crashed the Jungle Prom. Jessica is mad at Elizabeth because she thinks it's her fault that Sam is dead,but Jessica is the one that Spiked the punch at the Prom,not Elizabeth. Elizabeth goes over and over in her head what happened. Meanwhile,A 16 year old girl named Margo Black is coming to Sweet Vallley,She killed her Foster sister,Nina and burned down her foster parents house."
3,good,i loved this book. it had so much drama and it was unlike any of the other books in the sweet valley high series. i don't really see why everyone is hating on the book when its one of the best ones in the series. i loved it!
1,I didn't like this book at all,I think this was the worst book ever. I don't know why Ms. Pascal decided to change the series at all. You mean to tell me that there is someone out there who looks exactly like the Wakefield twins but isn't a blood relative? Please. The best thing about the original SVH series was that is was entertaining-a little cheesy at times but still entertaining. And now? Trust me you'd do better sticking with the earlier series than with this mess.
4,The great Mowtown sounds of the Four Tops,This cd is well worth the money it of course has all the great hits of the Four Tops. there is a huge collection of these 20th Century Millenium Collection with a lot of top artists and differend genres
2,What A Sham,"This collection had me foolishly thinking that this was all the Four Tops had to offer. Boy was I wrong, I heard It's The Same Old Song, I Believe In You And Me and other of the Tops hits and i felt cheated. I now have the Anthology which includes 48 songs. The two aforementioned songs as well as 'You Keep Running Away', 'River Deep, Mountain High', 'It's All In The Game' and all of their ABC/Dunhill hits like 'One Chain' and 'Are You Man Enough' are on the Anthology. Don't bother with this collection and get the Anthology."
5,Great Selection,"I love every one of the songs on this CD. This was a great choice. The CD came in during the timeframe I expected and was in great condition. As always, Amazon makes it easy to order and I will continue to do so in the future."
4,Sounds are great from the past.,It is fun to hear these songs after so many years and to think back with a bit of experience in life. The product arrived on a timely basis and was in excellent shape and in the condition as advertised. Thank you. Rick Ferry
4,like it,"I'm not a yoga lover, I'm more Jillian Michaels and high intensity or pilates. but I like yoga when I'm tired or for after work. this is perfect. I really enjoy this guy and the ""normal"" people. recommend it"
4,Great DVD,"This is a great Yoga DVD. Some of it was a lot harder than I expected. When you hear ""yoga"" you think it's just a bunch of stretching and poses, but it's a lot harder than it looks! Would purchase again."
5,for the variety,"This Dvd i use on days when i want to exercise or do some kind of stretching, but not such a cardio workout. I enjoy it."
5,Harder than I thought it would be...,"This DVD kicks butt! I am on week three and already feel more flexible and stronger. I have never done yoga before and I was able to jump right in without knowing the terminology for the poses etc. This is great for burning calories, but if you want flat abs you'll have to do crunches on your own, focus is on leg and arm strength. Worth the money for sure!"
2,I dont know about this!,"I bought this DVD thinking that it would be tailored for very overweight people since it is a ""Biggest Loser"" workout, but I could hardly do any of it. And worse was that he did the same poses OVER AND OVER AND OVER! So I kept thinking I might be able to do the next pose and then he'd do the same thing again...boring! So I didnt even get a workout cause I could hardly do it. Ive also heard bad things about the other Biggest Loser workouts so I wont be investing in them anymore...Tae-bo is still the best!!!"
2,not great,"I'm not a yoga fan, but am a HUGE fan of the Biggest Loser so I thought that might help get me interested. I'm a fairly active person and found this workout to be difficult even at the beginner level."
1,Terrible Workout!,"I've bought a lot of workout DVDs for variety and this has got to be about the worst one I've ever come across. If you are a beginner and need to get reintroduced into exercise, this may work for you. I'm going to give this to someone else to try."
2,not my favorite,I did not enjoy this workout at all. It says beginners and I guess I need an easier one than this. Or Yoga just isn't for me.
5,Wow!,"As with Biggest Loser Boot Camp, this is designed with heavier folks in mind. The workouts are no joke, but they are definitely doable. As with Biggest Loser Boot Camp you are able to customize your workout, doing only the portions you want to. 20 minutes seem a little longer with this workout, but it's manageable. The moves are fairly easy and they have people of differing abilities to follow for different levels of fitness. It's great in connection with the Biggest Loser Boot Camp DVD."
3,Just OK,"I bought this dvd after reading all the wonderful reviews.. I was disappointed! I like Bob and am a big fan of The Biggest Loser show. But, this routine is yoga/pilates, as Bob keeps repeating through out the workout. No abdominal crunches to be found he brags. But: lots of planks/push ups. He doesn't use the typical ""yoga verbage""..just very plain easy explanations. If you're a beginner this would work; but for someone who has been doing yoga for awhile, you would probably be disappointed in this routine. Maybe that's why Bob keeps instructing to use this dvd w/ the Biggest Loser Boot Camp routine for the best results. On my first view I went thru the entire routine without problem, very little sweat and left me wanting for a ""real yoga"" workout. I'll go back to Rodney Yee and Baron Baptiste."
5,Nice change up,"I got this DVD for a change from the average Biggest Loser workout videos. I was happily surprised at how much I enjoy this video. I workout everyday and feel the Biggest Loser videos are generally a tough workout. I was afraid this one might not be as tough. I was wrong. It's right up to par with all the previous Biggest Loser videos. When I did the first workout from the Weight Loss Yoga video, I wasn't sure if it was doing much. I felt it the next day. I made sure to do all the other workouts and definitely felt it was working. It's a great workout! I am so glad I purchased it to add to my Biggest Loser workout collection."
5,Great workout,"I have not been able to find many ""yoga"" tapes that I like because I feel that they are too slow moving and not hard enough. This Weight Loss Yoga tape may not be considered a traditional yoga tape because the first section is a mix of yoga and pilates, the second is abs and core, and the third section uses weights to provide an upper body workout. I feel like it works your whole body and incorporates stretching. I have alot of exercise tapes and go to the gym regularly for spinning. This tape is one of my favorites and will be used often. Plus, who wouldn't like watching Bob Harper?!"
5,Love this DVD,My daughter & I love this DVD. It gets you sweating. It actually feels like I did some work when I'm through. Plus Bob makes it enjoyable & helps with modification. We have never done Yoga before & this is great. I recommend this DVD. We love Bob!
5,ITS A WORKOUT !,I admit this wasn't as tough as I thought it would be since it is Bob Harper but it still was a good workout. It really takes its time to show you the moves without dumbing it down too much.
4,Good workout,"I am a beginner at yoga and just began dieting and exercising. This dvd definately leaves my muscles burning, me sweating, and out of breath. I love that there is a vareity of body sizes in the dvd and they show you how to modify the poses if you aren't able to do them.I absolutely LOVE the cooldown at the end of the workouts. It actually keeps me going through the 20 min workout (week 1 ) just to get to the cooldown. It leaves me so relaxed and mellow.You have to remeber this is Yoga for Weight Loss. Before I purchased this, it made me assume that poses would be different and a little more difficult/strenuous. It didn't let me down.This is perfect for beginners looking to lose weight. For people who have more experience in yoga and looking to maintain, I wouldn't suggest this video. It is slow, and a lot of talking, but it's perfect for someone like me who has no idea what they're doing."
5,Awesome Workout!!,"I am a runner, cyclist, hiker and skier and this work-out kicked my butt. I absolutely love it! I do it 3 - 4 times a week and am feeling stronger, more flexible and in better shape than ever. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to improve their physical fitness. You can make the work out as difficult as you like by going further or less far into the poses. Wonderful! Can't say enough!!!"
4,weight loss yoga,This dve is great!! I enjoy yoga but it always seemed to be too slow for me. This is not. I don't feel like I want to speed things up. Great workout and I love that they use former contestants from the Biggest Loser. It makes it more real.
3,"Not Yoga, But Not Bad","This is really more of a Pilates-inspired, Yoga-inspired workout video. It is NOT yoga. There is not enough explanation of breathing or alignment for those who haven't been doing yoga for a while. Many of the poses are yoga-inspired, but are not actual yoga poses. It's a decent workout, but burns fewer calories I believe than the other really excellent workouts in this series. It's good to stretch, and there is stretching here. But if you want a real yoga workout, this is not it. I'd recommend Kest or Yee for that."
5,A Great Workout,"This DVD provides a great workout that will strengthen every area of your body especially your abs and back. It is a 6-week program that will help you shed some pounds and has a maintenance workout to help you maintain the weight loss. I have lost 5-6lbs in just 3-weeks. You must do the DVD at least 4-5 times a week and maintain a healthy diet. I can see the toning in my muscles, so don't hesitate to get and use this workout DVD."
2,not real yoga,"This is a great workout video but that's what it is. Sure it uses some yoga poses but weights in a yoga class, the yogi's would roll over in their grave if they saw this. If you want a yoga workout then get Rodney Yee strength building yoga. It's true yoga using proper alignment and props.Bob looks great as usual but he need to help participants into proper positioning before they hurt themselves.Yogini"
2,Not the best..,"If you are looking for weight loss yoga I strongly recommend you pass on this one and purchase Jillian Michael's Yoga Meltdown. I own both DVDs and Jillian is simply a better instructor. Her routines flow much better from pose to pose, there is less repetition and Jillian is much more motivating than Bob. Also Jillian has pros in her video which really helps when posing, they are better to watch than the biggest loser contestants. This DVD is not bad in any way, it's just that Jillian's is better for yoga pros and beginners."
3,Real Weight Loss Yoga,"This is a great workout. For anyone you say yoga is easy, please trey this product, alot of sweating."
4,"Great workout, not a great yoga instructor","One of the best yoga DVDs for a serious workout. I'm not a yoga beginner, or a beginner at exercise in general, but this workout leaves me dripping sweat! Bob's a sweetheart and is super encouraging. I find myself smiling at some of his jokes, even the umpteenth time I've heard them and my arms or legs are shaking, though he does talk a little too much. The DVD is more focused on fitness than most yoga DVDs, and does not focus on breath enough, but that's understandable for a Biggest Loser workout. Bob's not the best at explaining form and the contestants who model often have incorrect form, so those who are new to yoga might want to start with some Rodney Yee or Linda Arkin or read a books that describe the poses in more depth before jumping into this DVD. There are a few places where the editing makes the timing uneven from side to side, but for such a great workout, I'll forgive this."
4,Great dvd,This is a great workout dvd. Boy you can really feel the burn. This is however not for anyone with weak wrists. There are variations on routines for someone with weak wrists but then you don't get the full workout. This is all in level 1. I like this dvd because you can customize your workout.
4,First time with yoga and it was great!,"I have never done any type of yoga before today. I got my dvd in the mail and couldn't wait to try it out! It was really great! I was worried that yoga wouldn't give much of a workout...just a few minutes in and I was sweating and my muscles were burning! :o) Bob does a great job explaining everything and after just a few minutes I didn't even need to look at the tv much for explanation, just listen to Bob's instructions. I'm going to follow the 6wk plan to, hopefully, build up to lever 3. If I remember I'll come back and edit this and let you know how it went and how the weight loss went.But anyway, I would say if you are considering buying this dvd...do it! you won't be sorry!*I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the music sucks...really...it's like weird creepy music...I don't know if that's a music thing or what lol but I'll wear my mp3 player next time :o) *"
3,"Good yoga, poor sound","The yoga was very good. However, the sound quality was poor. Had to turn up the volume to understand the instructions, which then made the music loud."
2,Not What I expected,"I just receieve this ""Yoga"" CD and was really disappointed. It is more like working out CD (not real yoga), quickly quickly alternating movements one after another without any breathing or pause. Each yoga movement should be done at least for 3 seconds. Here in this CD, he is rushing: one movement after the other. No time going into each pose...This is not yoga...I am not enjoying these exercises at all. Also, level 1 in the CD is not really level 1 yoga level...Level 1 is already assumed for the experienced users...It is concentrated on losing weight, but ...this is not yoga...it is speeding up weight loss workout...Very disappointed...Would need to return the tape."
3,Good,The workout was challenging but I liked it. The instructor just bores me! The DVD was good and came new but the rating was because dude is a snooze.
4,butt kickin' yoga!,"terrific workout, definitely NOT a calm, soothing-styled yoga routine. this is a work-out routine - make no mistake - and you WILL feel its effects (which, of course, is great). the nice thing about this particular choice is that it has multiple ""routines"" on the DVD (a nice feature) so you won't grow ""tired""/ bored w/ it, necessarily. this is NOT a ""meditative"" yoga; it IS a workout. my touche & legs (specifically) were really targeted areas (again, i felt it the next day). knockin' on 50's door, this is a great, stimulating, well-worth-the-investment video that's produced well. instructionally, the pace is decent & even for ""newbies"", there won't be difficulty ""following"" it."
5,Great all-around workout,"The Biggest Loser Weight-Loss Yoga is a great workout! It is definitely challenging, & is great for beginners - experts. Bob's instruction is right on & he has such a positive attitude. We use this video as part of out after-school workout club & you really sweat. I highly recommend this!"
3,DVD stopped working,"I dont know whats the prob with the DVD now, it doesnt not work anymore dint even used it for a week put together..."
2,I bought the program six months ago. I did not like the exercises. I do exercise 4 days per week.,"I do not like the exercises. I bought the program months ago and stopped using iteven though I do exercise 4 days per week.ON this shopping trip, it got into my shopping cart by mistake. I tried to return it."
4,It will kick your butt.,"You will sweat and burn doing this video. If you are looking for more umph in your yoga, try it."
5,Fun yoga workout!,"I'll admit I am a Bob Harper fan, but I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this workout. It features some of the old cast members from the biggest loser which is fun and Bob is typical Bob if you watch the show. All that being said the workout is great. I've been doing yoga for a few years and wanted an at home workout for those days when I can't get to the studio and this is a great one. Challenging and fun you can make the workout as long or as short as you want which is great. I haven't lost any weight yet, but I definitely know my body is changing. Good solid yoga workout for sure."
4,Harder than I thought it would be.,"This is a very good workout, it is more intense than I thought it was going to be. I guess I should of read closer about it being a Weight Loss Yoga, instead of thinking it was just regular yoga. If you want a more intense yoga workout I would suggest this one."
4,Not really what I expected...,"It has been my experience that most yoga videos are cookie-cutter. This one doesn't have to cheesy, distracting ""oriental"" music. The directions are not over explained nor is it implied that you know the moves and know what to do. The workout has been a much better time. I was looking for something to work myself w/o punishing me. I already lift weights, bicycle, aerobics, and belly dance. This is a nice way to mix things up!"
4,Great Yoga but not for beginner,I love this DVD. I consider myself an intermediate level. Bob inspires you as usual but it is a tuff workout. You know you were working out when done. It is in my dvd routine for two or three times a week.
5,love it!,"Ive just started getting into yoga and i like it but didnt really see it as ""weight-loss"" workouts until I bought this dvd. My legs were shaking at the end and I could really feel it the next day. More so than even some of my other brand cardio workout dvds. THis is a great workout. Relaxing too. I find that I personally like the biggest loser dvds where bob is the instructor - compared to the ones where jillian is. Her dvds give results too but she isnt as good of a motivator, i find her overly pushy and negative. And so i lose interest fast. But dvds with Bob such as this one,i love. He is very positive and focuses a lot on the perfect form, so i find that i have less issues with knee pain following the workout. definately recommend it."
5,Perfect starter video,"This video has all the needs for a great workout, I have been in and out of gyms since I was a teen ager, it's great for streching and indurance, I use it every morning and run 4-5 miles in the evening and I feel GREAT! it's worth the money by ten fold..."
5,I love Bob,"I bought this yoga workout because I already owned the Bootcamp with Bob and I love it. I couldn't find the yoga video at any local stores so I got it on Amazon. It's excellent. Bob is just so calm and relaxed that it makes me feel like I can do anything. The workouts are intense yet relaxing. I like yoga because it's a little less of a workout, meaning I don't sweat as much, but it's made for burning calories so even though I'm not sweating, I feel I get a great workout. I would recommend this video especially if you don't have time necessarily to shower after it. I am a student as well as a mom and when I do Bootcamp with Bob I HAVE to shower afterword because I am dripping with sweat. The yoga video I can do quickly in about a half an hour and then just freshen up and feel good the rest of the day."
3,"A whole lot of leg, and arm work!","This yoga video was not what I expected it to be. It was a good video and I did enjoy it, but it concentrated on certain areas more than others and I tired out easily. Maybe it was just me..lol"
4,Good Challenging Yoga Work-Out For The Purpose of Weight Loss,"I love watching The Biggest Loser. I need to lose 20 lbs., but otherwise I'm in pretty good shape. I've been doing yoga for years, but wanted to try a new program just because it can be boring going through the same routine.Well, this one is tough! Not that the moves themselves are difficult, but it isn't the slow-moving yoga that I prefer. It is, however, a good, challenging work-out. It is meant to help with weight loss and pushes a little harder than I wanted to be pushed, but I think that's the idea of it. Not bad! It's worth a try."
3,"Okay, not great","As someone that has done yoga for some time on and off, this DVD provided a refresher of poses and a couple of new ones. The best way for me to get a really good workout was to do all levels at once."
5,Love It,I work out at 5 am and this video is perfect for the days when I'm just not up for a hardcore workout but still want to sweat. It's not like the other yoga/pilates videos that I've done where you just stretch and breathe. This makes you burn! If you are trying to find a low impact yoga this one is not it.
5,5 STARS! You will love having Bob Harper in your living room!,This is a great DVD for getting into shape or getting back into shape. The exercises are fairly simple and it is easy to follow. The only thing that gets a little annoying during the video is Bob's talking-- he talks a lot!
5,Excellent Work Out,"I have only been doing this for four days, but I am already seeing a difference in my body. The first day, my body was shaking afterward, but I felt great. Also, when Bob says things like, ""You did it"" and ""Don't give up now!"" it makes me feel like he's really talking to me. His instruction on form is great, you can almost do it without looking at the video. I also love seeing former BL contestants and that they show someone doing the modified poses for beginners. Now, if I can only get Ali's body, I'll be thrilled. :)"
3,Super Reader,"A spook ring running a fake communicate with the dead sc@m in aid of corporate malfeasance runs afoul of The Shadow, as well as detective Joe Cardona, and a plucky young bloke trying to help out his now wealthy through inheritance aunt.Cardona briefly doubts The Shadow's motives, but he should know better: ""Often had The Shadow's terrible automaticsbarked forth their message of doom to those who fought the law."""
4,Sim Battery for Nokia Phones,"This battery is extremely slim and lightweight. I carry my cell phone on my belt everyday and changing to this smaller, lighter battery made the phone less cumbersome. The only thing I don't like about this battery is the limited talk time, about 2.75hrs, compared to the battery I received with the phone. The nicest feature is being able to charge it at anytime because the Lithium-Polymer batteries will not build up a memory."
1,Not for the Nokia 5165,"Despite the site note that this is compatible, the battery has a convex surface that faces the flat phone back. This does not fit the 5165 model. I guess I need to try someplace else for a battery which is slimmer than the standard unit."
1,This battery sucks,"The advertisement on this page indicates up to SEVEN days of standby time. Upon receipt of this piece of crap, I charged it overnight and after only 24 hours it had already lost half the charge.Don't cheap out and buy this. Go for the $60.00 one which may actually last a while."
1,This battery doesn't last!,I've owned this battery for just over a year and it no longer holds a charge. I'm lucky if I get a day of normal talk time out of it. I'm very dissatisfied with this product.
5,Flights of Fancy,"Katharine Eliska Kimbriel delivers two heroines who are as distinctive as they are compelling.Brenna is the complex, walker between worlds who must decipher the mysteries within herself if she is to unlock the secrets of a people's past and the world's future. As good as the title story is, it's the second, short character study of a young woman on the cusp of womanhood that haunts and moves.Allie seems to tell a deceptively simple tale of duck hunting and the lessons of survival, but opens a window for the reader into her own fiercely glowing soul as she learns larger lessons about family dynamics and redefining her own place in a changing world.Kimbriel illuminates as she writes and sometimes dazzles to the point of momentary blindness--a necessity as the reader needs sometimes pause to digest how some subtleties weave together into bursts of clarity.Count me in as a new and enthusiastic fan!"
3,okay,"I thought it would be a novel, not two short stories. or at least all stories of th alfresda character"
1,terrible,I am returning this video. Cover said it contained 12 episodes and there were only 6. Also the quality of the video was awful.
1,POOR quality,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother. We attempted to watch but the quality was so poor, we had to turn it off."
3,Dave Robicheaux,"A friend of mine likes this author and I tried it but was not crazy about this story, it couldn't keep my interest. Usually when I read a book I can't put it down but this was not the case. Probably won't read another of his books"
5,Burkes Books,"I always enjoy James Lee Burke's ""Dave Robicheaux"" series. I have most of his books and will be ordering more. Thanks."
3,Not one of his finer efforts,"I have been reading James Lee Burke for years, and consider him the best living crime fiction writer in America. I eagerly await each of his summer releases. However, I am sad to say that I now believe he is merely mailing it in. The plot of this book is nothing special, and re-tills a lot of now stale ground for Burke. Clearly, Burke cannot create female characters of any complexity at all. Robicheaux even admits that he fuses his dead wife and his living one into a single entity. Why not, they are the same character. Finally, the editing errors are inexcusable. One is left thinking that Burke does not possess spell-check and that nobody does even a rudimentary proof-read of his work."
5,Hasn't lost a step,"Whoever said, in the reviews below, that JLB is a poet, got it exactly right. Which is not to say that he doesn't provide tons of great action mixed in with all the beautiful descriptions and poignant ruminations on bygone eras.This is probably as good as any in the series, though it seems a tad darker, and more elegaic than most that have come before...I don't recall as savage a beating being handed out as the one Dave gives to one miscreant here in past series entries...Long may Robicheaux do the full tilt boogie!"
2,VERY WEAK JLB ENTRY,"Yikes. I've greatly enjoyed other titles in this series. But the author dropped the ball on this one. Epically long, nonsensically dull-just an all round mess. I barely made it to the end. You didn't care what happened to anyone in the 'story'. A real drag. In past entries the author has created thoroughly engrossing characters and plots, even if his philosophizing is more than a little silly. This one's a big fat dud."
3,Same Old Story,"I have always loved the Dave Robicheaux mysteries but this one was a disappointment since it seemed to be a carbon copy of previous ones. I still love the character however, his demons and his out of control friends seem a bit over the top."
2,Use your time to read something else,"Not to mince words, but this was a terrible book. I read it after seeing it listed on Bill O'Reilly's website as one of his favorite authors, so I thought I would give it a try.I count at least 9 seperate plots in the novel, and each of them is progressed by the illogical deductions of the detective title character. I get the sense that the author didn't quite know what he wanted to write so he just threw in everything he could think of.If you are in the mood for a detective story, pick up a Robert B. Parker novel and save yourself the trouble here."
2,Pegasus Descending,"The narrative's sanctimonious pomposity, the plot's absurdly thin veneer, the author's inability to get even simple facts (he thinks Lujan is not a Hispanic/Latino surname) correct is just the start. The main problem with this 100 i.q. book is there are no human characters in it. Just out of stubbornness i finished all 500 pages and all he could deliver were flat caricatures at best. I got the book from the library, and still felt ripped off. Yech.Pegasus Descending: A Dave Robicheaux Novel (Dave Robicheaux)Pegasus Descending : A Dave Robicheaux NovelPegasus DescendingPegasus DescendingThe Tin Roof Blowdown: A Dave Robicheaux Novel"
3,Burke needs somthing fresh,"There is no question Burke's writing is rich and engages all the senses. Yes, Cletes is a great sidekick and all of that. I have read all of the Robicheaux series and this one seems stamped out of the same template of the others. Here's what has become standard:1. One of the bad guys grew up in the small town with Robicheaux.2. The bad guy is rich.3. The bad guy is tied in with the mob.Question: How many bad guys can a small town in Lousiana produce?Burke needs to break out of this stale mold and come up with a fresh plot and setting and characters to compliment his great writing. This is not a bad book, it's just that I've read it 5 times before."
3,More of the same is getting old,"This book is what I've come to expect from James Lee Burke; multiple plotlines, lush, descriptive writing and Clete Purcell, one of the most entertaining characters in fiction today. What's getting mightly old, though, is Dave's insufferable self righteousness. For an old drunk with a violent past and a low grade job, he sure does damn well expect his peers to treat him with a sense of decorum straight out of Emily Post's Rules of Etiquette. It's getting to be too much. His false sense of nobility rankles and this will be the last of the Dave Robicheaux books I'll be reading."
5,A Robicheaux Classic,"In Pegasus Descending, James Lee Burke has produced yet another successful Robicheaux novel, with its unique descriptors, colorful characters, and several interwoven plots that keeps the reader's or listener's interest and wanting more. The audiobook is read by Will Patton, who does an excellent job of bringing Burke's characters to life."
5,Not Allowed!,"I'm sorry, no one is allowed a negative review of Burke's work. Go ahead and lambast any other author for any reason you see fit. Hammer Hammett, bash on Baudelaier, rip on Ayn Rand, but Burke is off limits. The penalty for violating this rule is 25 consecutive reads of David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. If you don't enjoy James Lee Burke you have skipped too many of your weekly psych evals or you are so unhappy that nothing brings you joy."
5,First James Lee Burke Book I've Ever Read And It Won't Be The Last,"As my title says, I'd never read a James Lee Burke book before. This author really knows how to write. His descriptive manner placed me in New Orleans and allowed me to see the beauty of the homes, hear the sounds of the river, listen to the tugboats and even the crocodiles swishing their tails in the water. The story begins some years earlier which gave me a good picture of the lead character and where he came from before bringing the story forward into present day. Each character in the book is more than one dimensional. You know each and every one of them and what makes them tick. The ending and putting all the pieces together of the crime(s) was very well done. I thought several times, I had ""whodunnit"" figured out but I was wrong and pleased to admit it. An excellent book."
5,The Bobbsey Twins of Homicide Ride Again,"I have to admit that I haven't enjoyed the past couple of Dave R books as much as the older ones- but I found this one almost impossible to put down. Maybe it's because there's a good amount of Clete here- Clete Purcell, Dave's sidekick and best friend. When Clete's around, things get lively- and this story is no exception. The plot is terrific, the pacing never lets up, the writing as beautiful as ever, and I loved this book. My one quibble with the books is that Dave's three wives seem interchangeable- when I'm reading about Molly, she reminds me of Bootsie, who reminded me of Annie. But that's a minor annoyance when a book is as irresistible as this one. Bravo!"
5,Another book of poetry by Burke.,HIs prose is poetry to me. I love his writing. I can smell and feel the scenes that he describes so well.My only regret is that I have slowly worked my way towards the end of this series. I shall very much miss Dave whenever I get to the last book. I can only hope that Mr. Burke goes on forever......
4,Robicheaux never gets old,"Dave Robicheaux may be putting on years, but he never gets old. Truly one of the great characters in American serial fiction, every novel gives him a little more depth. I give this entry into the series four stars only as I compare it to Burke's others. While Robicheaux still is written as deeply as others, other characters, especially Clete and Helen are given much less substantial roles than in previous books. Also, while the bad guys are still as evil, the overall feeling in the book is not as concentrated. That said, if I was grading this book in comparison to others on the market it would still be a five-star effort. It is only when compared to Burke's best that it earns only four stars."
4,Burke is back,"I am a HUGE Dave Robicheaux fan, but the last few novels (e.g., Crusader's Cross) have been . . . well . . . pretty stale and predictable. However, this book reaffirms Burke's return as a master of the genre. That said . . . I didn't give this a top rating, because he overreached a little with too many things going on. That said, it is less predicatable with more twists than the too simplistic, bland, and contrived Crusader's Cross."
4,A must have for people doing research in theoretical crypto,"This is a sequel of Foundations of Cryptography, Vol 1, which covers theoretical proofs of signatures, encryptions, and more.The price of $75.00 is a bit prohibitive at the moment, and the contents are a little bit dense to follow, but this is an important book to have if you want to do research in theoretical crypto."
3,The audiece point,"Genesis first live album - some parts are magical some are not.but definitly it is not as good as some are telling.check out the studio albums - this is just a kind of ""Best of"" and songs are not better than it's album versions."
3,Great songs but bad sound,"I aggre with another reviewer, some material is missing, I am talking about Supper's ready of course. The mistake has been corrected many years later with ""Archives"". I would have liked also ""The Fountain of Salmacsis"" instead of ""The return of the Giant Hogweed"". The choice of tracks is a good one even with the missing cuts, but the sound is horrible. By far, I prefer the studio version of each of theses songs.One last point, this material sound a bit dated, I won't listen to it very often in the future because it sound older and older each time I am listening to this cd. Same reaction with Nursery and Foxtrot."
3,"Not a great live album, but a very good one.","Featuring a mere 5 songs from the Trespass, Nursery Chryme and Foxtrot albums, this live album captures Genesis at the very cusp of greatness in '73. The sound quality has been improved a bit with digital remastering, compared to the somewhat shallow sound of the LP. The Nursery Chryme classic The Musical Box is the highlight here. It's disappointing to learn that the performance of Supper's Ready (the epic piece from Foxtrot) was to have originally been included in this set, but the record company at the time didn't think Genesis rated a double live album. Oh, well..."
4,A good idea of the sound of Genesis live in their early days,"""Live"" by Genesis is definitely worth it if you want to hear the band live in their early days. This particular concert was recorded on their tour following the release of ""Foxtrot"", and it brilliantly displays the musicianship of everyone in the band- from the keyboard solos of Tony Banks to the ""bass pedal solo"" from Michael Rutherford (Musical Box intro) to master guitarist Steve Hackett and skinsman Phil Collins. ""Live"" is also an excellent capture of the many vocal personas Peter Gabriel enacted on stage. The only downside to the album is the lack of the classic ""Supper's Ready"", which I've read from several places it was released on a later album. But all in all, a great album and worth picking up."
2,NOT for Children!!!,"While the material in these books is lots of fun, this is not a book that should be left lying around where younger readers to get their hands on it.There are various entries in unexpected parts of the books that touch on sexual acts, some of which are decidedly outside social norms (including references to urine and ""water sports"", insects and formicophilia); same-sex relations (both positive and negative statements); genitalia; fellatio; and more.For kids in high school, this may be acceptable, depending on the maturity of the child, but this is certainly not a book that should be left where children in the lower grades can read it without supervision and adult guidance."
1,BOOK OF UNTRUE INFORMATION!!!,"Save your money, and buy a book that has factual information in it. I looked up some of the things in this book because they seemed hard to believe, and learned it was because they were not at all true. This is a waste."
4,"FUN, FUN AND MORE FUN","A fun, interesting book and a good one to have on the kitchen table when you and your friends get to yakking about trivia, or just to start up a conversation. It also answers a lot of questions that you might get from one of your children, or if a teacher (who's expected to know all), from the students. I liked it and would recommend it to others, who appreciate knowing ""useless information,"" like me and my passel of friends, always committed to learning ""new stuff."""
3,Pretty Easy?,I have a six and sixteen year old and they both did the maze with the ball the ffirst time (too easy?)
4,"thorough, thoughtful, but at times hard to read","Dr. Mackey has written an excellent book giving key insights into the symbolism of lodge activities and degree ceremonies. There is a lot to learn here. Unfortunately, he wrote this book in 19th century intellectual prose, which is cumbersome by today's standards. So it takes a bit of work to get through. This new edition is simply a modern publisher's photocopy of the original, and a very few sections of the text are hard to see. But those gripes aside, it's well worth reading. As a 32nd degree Mason, I found it quite useful and illuminating, and I recommend it to the curious and the Mason."
2,Really hard to read,"The text is really small and hard to see. I have a kindle 2. Maybe its better on the DX. Its almost worthless because its so hard to read, and my eyes are pretty good. Its a great book to read if you can see what it says. I borrowed the original and it's the same thing. Just hard to see. Plus you can NOT adjust the text size. It stays super small no matter what. Good luck."
3,"not thrilled, but not disappointed","With their name and their theme, I was expecting Myriads to have more of an old-Tristania sound, but instead, they're fairly mellow. The girl is not a good singer. The songs are really long and don't change enough, and while it was cool they did the male choirs and strings, they really could've emphasized them more. The music is good, just not totally original. Anyway, cool stuff if you're into Norwegian gothic metal, a.k.a. the only gothic metal worth listening to."
5,Great insert,"What do you want me to say about this insert? It fit perfectly in my G1023. Smooth surface. Easy to cut. Stays put. Would like a hole in the plate for removal, but a quick trip to the drill press with a 3/4"" bit solves that."
1,Good Book ???,"It does cover many things about java but the format is horrible.For most chapters, it will give all the theories at the start of the chapters and overwhlem you with all the examples towards the end. It is quite a comprehensive book but you are going to have a hard time linking the theories with the examples.Strongly not recommended for begineers"
1,This book makes Java more difficult than it actually is!,This is so far the worst programming book I've ever read. The authors obviously don't know how to teach the subject. They throw everything at you at the first few chapters and expect readers to understand it at the end. A terrible book!
2,Like New???,"I understand you get your money's worth but false advertisement is another thing. Maybe it was an error on the sender's part but I ordered a book ""like new"" at a like new price. I received a book that had water stains, crumpled edges, and an appearance of found it in the attic lets sell it on Amazon. I read reviews expecting more and was dissappointed!"
3,From the perspective of a working programmer....,"For those of you who already have experience in one programming language I would suggest you investigate the WROX Press book from the series Programmer to Programmer titled Beginning Java 2 SDK 1.4 Edition by Ivor Horton. My own method of using this book is to skim the text until I find code examples that are new to me and then read the text and enter and compile the code, changing it until I feel confident using it, and then I move on to the next interesting piece of code. I already own the third edition of Java How to Program and have to purchase the fifth edition for a class. If I use it at all, it will probably be to read exercises which may be assigned. Remember, I have many years experience as a working professional, in my opinion, Java How to Program was written for beginning programmers and it has been too long ago for me to remember what it was like to be a beginner, or to give a beginner advise about this book."
2,Too Wordy,"This book is almost 1600 pages, and is way too wordy.Hence, the book is difficult to learn from and is a not a good reference.The authors need to be far more succinct and to he point."
3,Repetitive and overdosage!,"I was throughly confused after reading the chapter on Exception Handling. There was so much repetitive usage of the phrases and words and concepts to explain a simple thing of the propogating of exception up the ""call stack"". Its taken me a full two days to unlearn what I read from this book and to relearn it on my own from various sources on the net and from the Java Tutorial. Ooff! what a pain. The one great thing about Deitel books is the similarity of structure and approach across all the programming languages that they have books on, but I believe that its this ""similarity"" that can become confusing!!"
2,Much too dense for a beginner,"I chose this book as a text, on the recommendation of a colleague, for an Intro to Java course that I was teaching . After three weeks of using it, I regretted my choice. It is much too dense for a beginner. It also doesn't seem to have a good step-by-step method for learning the parts of the language, preferring to jump ahead into more advanced concepts that are mentioned in an offhand manner far too often. I found myself flipping back and forth constantly. Having said that, I feel that it is a good book to use if you have a decent programming background and a lot of time available. The examples are comprehensive (again, as long as you don't mind flipping back and forth), which would make this book a good auxiliary text."
2,Overpriced and Underdelivers,"I can certainly understand the point that the authors were trying to make in presenting us with a textbook that teaches Java while also teaching about the object-oriented paradigm and relating the concepts to software engineering and UML. For that, I can give the book an additional star over the one I would normally award; but that's all. The combination of these concepts within the pages of this volume is so cluttered, so badly written and so poorly executed as to make the effort all but useless. With so many less expensive and better written alternatives available (e.g., ""Thinking in Java,"" which can be downloaded for free, and Bloch's ""Effective Java Programming Language Guide""), there are simply too many options available. Between them and the many online tutorials that are available, there is no reason to saddle the reader with such a ponderous edition. Give this one a pass."
2,Good book - way overpriced.,"I got this book as a gift and I already had the Wrox java book by Ivor Horton. They are both very good books, comparable in material covered and in clarity of instruction and explanation. However, this book is over twice the amount of the Wrox book with no advantage. I recommend the Wrox book hands down, unless you just have money to burn."
2,Used in school and do not like it,"I used this in my intro to java class and I have to say I didnt like it. If you are teaching yourself DO NOT get this book, its is very jumbled and abstract. When we where learning the class we would have to jump from chapter to chapter so we could learn properly because nothing is on order."
2,Hard to find information,"It is hard for me to imagine how they managed to publish four editions before this book. The index is terrible; it frequently refers to pages that then refer you to other pages for more information. The index should refer you to the primary location in the first place, and maybe other locations as an after-thought, not the other way around.The overall format of the book also seems to be haphazard, as if the authors did not know which direction to pursue. Granted, there is a lot of information, but it is difficult to decipher.I have enjoyed other Deitel&Deitel; programming books, and was looking forward to reviewing this one. However, now that I have, I can not recommend it."
4,Deitel Does it Again!,"I've been using Deitel's books for my university studies for some time now, and of all of them, this book is probably one of their better publications. Don't be fooled; this is not a book for the casual reader. If you can't absorb a lot of material, or prefer skimming through the book to learn, this probably isn't your java book. However, if you have patience and some time to read some fairly detailed information, you will learn a lot from this book. It includes a CD packed full of useful code examples, websites etc, and code examples on the CD are reviewed in the book, providing an excellent learning experience. Not only that, but examples and subject materials are explained in great detail, and CLAIRITY (imagine that!). It's a steep price, but if you want to learn some Java, give it a shot."
5,Excellent book for future programmers,"I disagree with the last reviewers of this book because they may not have had pervious programming or have not coded with the Java programming language. This books is probbly the best to learn Java with due to its low technical terms and pharses.One of my college classes uses the 4th edition of this book and after reviewing this edition (5th), I highly recommend it. It has greater clarity about subjects then the 4th edition and the new highlighting within the code makes it eaiser to follow along. Also the authors did an great service for those who struggle to learn programming by dividing up the programs into smaller sections. I highly recommend this newer edition if you are in a class that uses the older editions, read and like their pervious editions, or want further understanding into Object-Oriented with the Java programming language."
5,From strength to strength,"With its fifth edition, Java How to Program just keeps on goingfrom strength to strength. Always one of the most reliablecoverages of Java, the new edition confirms the book's positionas one of the absolutely unmissable whether you're new toprogramming or just new to Java."
1,"Software Engineering, Not Just Programming","This fat book is not just how to program Java, it is how to do softwareengineering! By including a case study, with up-front analysis and designdiagrams in UML, Deitel and Deitel bring the big picture of softwaredevelopment into an introductory programming book."
1,Hey this serves as a dictionary without the definitions!,"KEEP AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!! This will only make look up lots of words in the dictionary and when you are tired of that you will need to buy another book and start all over again. Plus it has lots of bad algorithms... Use this as keywords reference, use the tips but don't read this book unless your school forces you to."
1,waste time and money,"the book is not understandable after chapter 7 ,,i needed another book to understand the concepts and i needed to carry a few dictionary too, deitel should use an easier language to understand,may be they will do in the 15th edition of this book1i reccomend walter savitch ,this is a good book,first i read the book and then i read the chapter that i didnt understand in deitel, after all ,deitel made some sense!"
1,Terrible,"briefly ,the book is too hard to understand especially after chapter 7,u need a few dictionaries to understand the explanations of the codes, i suggest Walter Savitch 2nd edition,i have this book too and now i understand the concepts"
1,Don't reccomend for experienced -or- beginners!,"I cannot reccomend this book to experienced programmers learning Java or to beginners. The experienced will find it cluttered and watered down, and beginners will end up with a very novice, incomplete, and probably incorrect comprehension of the more complicated aspects.The first few chapters are ok for someone new to programming but beyond that the text is extremely bloated and only explains complex topics with ""for dummies"" examples that will leave you unable to perform in a real enviroment."
2,"Again, schools choose the worst of the lot","It never ceases to amaze me: why do schools consistently choose the worst books out of so many titles out there? Look at the reviews for most of the books they choose and you'll see what I mean.This book mires you with dense details from the start. What a way to start your programming class or career. It would've made a ton of difference if they started with some meaty examples so that the beginning programmer can see something tangible. ""Hello World!""? Please. They dive right into dissecting every little detail, line by line. You never get to see the big picture because your brain is trying to figure out every line. I've read both the Java, C++ and C by Deitel and I've never came away thinking I can put everything together and build something useful.If you know another language, don't buy this book. If you need a reference, don't buy this book. If you are taking a class, you'll probably be forced to buy this book."
2,A Pain in the neck,"Yes, it's comprehensive. 1400 pages of unreadable dribble. I had trouble keeping my eyes open. Worse than Wrox at taking pieces of code then demonstrating a billion line examples, explaining them line by line. The explanations are usually a few pages forward in the book so you have to read a sentence, flip back a few pages, read the next sentence, etc ad naseum. Not for beginners. Make sure you have a grip on C++ before attempting this. If you already know Java you might like the book because it covers a lot like Cell phone and PDA tools."
2,Not for beginners!,"This was the text assigned for a beginning course in Java programming. The book constantly introduces more complex concepts in code examples of elementary topics. There is so much flipping back and forth, as another review noted, that my copy turned yellow with Post-its. It is frequently used as a text because the publishers provide PowerPoint lecture slides for the examples in the book. It might well be an excellent refresher for intermediate or advanced programmers, but beginners would be better off with Sun's well-organized and free on-line tutorial."
4,One Of The Best In The Entire Series.,"After the last 2 disastrous ( To say the least ) MTV PARTY TO GO volumes, This latest entry returns the series back to its original formula. The first half features remixes and club hits from Amber, Joey McEntyre, Leann Rimes, Jennifer Paige that will pump up any party, then slows down the pace with cool smooth jams from a Aaliyah, Monica, 702 and Britney Spears and rounds it up with two pop balads one from 98 degrees and the other from Jennifer Love Hewitt. This is definately one of the best volumes of the series, the mix is amazing and the song selection rocks. A Must have for any dance, R&B and pop music fan."
5,Enjoyable!,"I brought this CD the day it was released. I think that the tracks by Before Dark,Jennifer Paige and Amber are great! I love this album and I'm not even a teenager anymore!"
3,love and understanding,That song makes me understand what I needed to expect in a relationships with someone.How that someone suppose to treat me and my needs and the things that the person to do on order to keep me happy . It's the same thing for myself to which is I need to some thing for my partner too so that he could be happy in the relationships that we have .
5,Insightful and incisive,"I encountered Vector in the 80s. They played at the Cornerstone Festival near Chicago several years running. Their passion came through in their music and lyrics, and I was hooked. At the time, I got all their albums on cassette. When I saw this CD set, I had to order it. I wasn't disappointed. The music holds up very well. It's still as powerful today as it was then."
1,Don't waste your money,"As a Joe collector and a Lego collector, I was interested in the ""Built to Rule"" Lego clones that Hasbro came up with. My interest died after the first set I got, the Cobra Raven set, (I also got the Transformers Jetfire set, also just as bad). Ugh. The pieces will not stay together even while building, much less for play or display. The quality seems to be poor, and there are so many pre-built and single purpose pieces that it pretty much cancels out any point to it being building blocks.I was happy it came with one of my favourite Cobras, but that was about it. Utterly useless otherwise. As a Joe collector, I recommend you avoid it. As a Lego collector, I recommend you avoid it."
3,A good intro (only if you know absolutely nothing about XML),"I think my title says it all. This book was very helpful to me and it should be for anyone looking for an introduction and a little history on XML. It starts out very basic though, and moves sloooowly up the knowlege ladder. I was tired of it quickly and found myself skipping chapters to get 'just the facts please'. If you know nothing about XML and need an intro, you may want this book but I would look around for others as well. This lacks hard-core examples."
4,"Good level, examples for beginner. Best I've found so far.","Pros: Provides XML at a beginner's level concisely. Good examples. Excellent references to web resources (brave guy - writes URLs with real ink)Cons: Typesetting/composition confusing and tiring. Needs a better font, more white space, code examples spanning fewer pages & set in a fixed-width font.Could be better organized. Lacks reference resources (but references to the web may be a better use of reader time.) Will suffer the obsolesence common to all books written about draft standards.Conclusion: It's probably the best commercial book yet available (5/98) - well worth the relatively inexpensive price."
2,"Dense, difficult writing","I'm an experienced programmer, with a few months experience doing intranet development with HTML and Cold Fusion. I was looking for an intro to XML that focused on the rationale, the architecture, etc. (ie - not a how-to tutorial). This book fits that bill. However, I found the writing style to be dense and difficult to follow. For me, it was sleep-inducing. I found the examples to be too few and not well explained."
3,Rushed to Press,"My problem isn't so much with the content (which does tend to get ahead of itself in places... using terms that haven't been fully explained beyond expanding the acronym) as it is with the presentation. I'm sure MISpress was in a hurry to catch the popular wave of the XML tide, but this is really sloppy. The margins are off and awkward. This may have been forgivable until I found an entire page (pg 54 in my copy) containing the data from the previous page. Whatever was supposed to appear on that page got lost somewhere in this print run, but I didn't pull this information off of a website (where it might be forgivable)... I paid for it."
2,A very disappointing book for software developers,"Some people appear to really like this book. It has received many glowing reviews, but I can only shake my head in disagreement. This book is a dud -- too much text, and not enough practical advise or code examples.The author could not adequately describe how to use basic XML components such as Document Type Definitions (DTDs), and failed to show how Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can be used to display XML on the web.If you are a web programmer or need to do something useful withXML, look elsewhere. This is not the book for you. In fact, I'm selling this book. Wanna buy it? I'll use the proceeds to purchase ""Beginning XML"" by Kurt Cagle. That book looks promising."
2,Conversational. I didn't find what I was looking for.,"I am looking for a book that explains what XML is, what it should be used for, and details. In this book I found discussions of HTML, XML, and SGML, and the pros and cons of various styles, but I did not find the overview I needed nor the details. I like to read books that get right to the point. (I also like to read unix(tm)-style manual pages). Although this book has lots of usefull content, I did not find what I was looking for."
4,An excellent and entertaining introduction to XML.,"This is quite a good book. It's a reasonably thorough introduction to XML, which is well written, often entertaining, and always clear. The author takes the time to put his material in context, and discusses future directions and proposals in clearly marked sidebars. And, unlike some notable other texts on this subject, it's *concise*."
3,Worth a Try,"This was an OK product for the price. It wasn't the best I've tried, but it wasn't the worst. It was a little noisier than I expected."
1,Set of 18!!!!!!!!! Only shipped 1!,"Really what is more important than the title/description of a listing?????I got 1- only 1 bone, when title states set of 18- now I did think it very strange the pricewould be so low but really- ever heard of proof reading?"
3,"Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive problems!!!","Downrated to 3 stars because the author is too repetitive. Although I enjoyed this book, the author repeats the same information several times in the course of a few pages (eg. discussion of tetrapod anapsid versus diapsid skull morp[hology, lifestyles of ichythosaurs, etc). The fact that the each major chapter was reviewed independently really shows. Taxonomy and other topics are treated well and the author writes reasonably well."
3,Swing Years Production,"I cannot attest to viewing quality of this DVD but I found a picture and a description on FOOTLIGHTS dot COM. The description is as follows:This all region DVd compiles music clips from the Swing Years! 22 Selections by various artists, including Dick Browno, Frank Cook & the Four Merry Men, Harry Cool, Vanita Smythe, Betty Clooney, Lina Romay, Gene Williams, The Music Maids..."
1,Not as described,"I ordered this based on the fact that I could adjust it and it would clip to the air conditioning vents. However, there are no clips, no release button, and it does not adjust. After receiving the product, I think the description given must be for a different product."
4,Undertow,"While the whole debut album by Chroma Key, ""Dead Air For Radios"" is good, it is the CD's third track, ""Undertow"" which captures my attention. For me, this song's emotion is quite remeniscent of some of Kevin's work with Dream Theater. Especially ""Space Dye Vest"". While the album features music in it's simplest forms, there is no denying that this album captures the ""real"" Kevin Moore. Keep up the good work, Kev!"
2,Unlike anything by Dream Theater,"The album has to much sampling for my taste. Moore remains a great keyboardist, although I don't care for his singing."
5,Harpers Bride,"Great story, kept my interest throughout the entire story. Loved the ending. Would recommend it to all my friends. Interested in reading more books by this author"
3,Mixed feelings,"A slowly paced western romance that doesn't gain speed throughout the book. The plot is simple and predictable, without being boring though. Likeable main characters, however, there are nearly no supportive secondary characters, which leaves only the leading persons to unfold the plot. Unfortunately, I had more than once the impression that these two could not fulfill these demands, therefore the author used many monologues to make good for the deficiencies, which was sometimes a little long-winded. By contrast, the end was not enough developed and rather rushed.Dylan Harper was such an absolute super hero that I tend to forgive some of above lacks. The same goes for Melissa Logan who began her life as a misused child, became a harassed wife, faced a very challenging life without her husband and only after all these ordeals became a self-confident woman.In any case, the book had its good moments but failed to enthuse me. What a pity, because there was more than enough potential!"
5,Harper Made Me Happy,"I am not a big fan of Western Romances, however, I really, really like this book! I liked how the author's descriptive writing put you in the place and time of the story.Families are made in a variety of ways today, so it was timeless. Melissa found herself and found a good man in Dylan.It was a touching story. Loved Rafe and his wisdom. I read it in one day, couldn't put it down - it was like watching a good movie. It was a little bit predictable, but who cares, it did not take away from the excellent writing and heartwarming storyline. I will probably check out some more Western Romances...and this writer."
2,Maybe it wasme...,"I was looking forward to reading this book. It sounded promising- things I like- damsel in distress, strong hero, and great sidekick friend. But then geez. The book just never did anything for me.There was a lot of angst and no sizzle. I mean it was angst, angst, and more angst. They do get together..then they split up, then wham o, back together. But with no sizzle really. I mean really?? After all that?This a romance with lots of heartache and sadness and a small happy ending. I need more than that."
3,"Good,basic, historical romance","Harper's bridge is a nicely written, historical romance. It was a good read, but it had the predictable plot that most books of this genre have. I read for the enjoyment that it puts into my life, and this book fulfilled that purpose."
4,Pretty good read,"Good book. ienjoyed reading the story ofdylan and melissa. it could of had more to it, i like drama in a romance novel but i did enjoy reading this story."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"Based on the other reviews and the description, I had really high hopes for Harper's Bride. Sadly, it was a predictable book, the characters were shallow (particularly Dylan, as well as the secondary/supporting characters), and their interactions seems contrived and unnatural. Also, the writing was overly simplistic, unsophisticated and unimaginative. Overall I was disappointed."
5,"A Realistic, Entertaining, and Beautiful Romance","This book is beautifully unique with a fresh approach to a much-used plot idea. The characters are so well drawn that they pop off the page, find a place in your heart, and never allow you to forget them. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a touching and satisfying romance."
2,a bit dull,I was surprised when I read this book at how dull it was - especially after reading the reviews. There was precious little dialogue in the book to move the story along and quite a bit of the internal musings of the characters. I did not feel that the love story was well developed. It did not hold my interest and I was just turning pages trying to get to the end.
5,Excellent!!,Such a great storyline and a terrific hero and heroine.The sceens came to life in Dawson during the gold rush. Just wonderful!!I was thrilled when Coy died but I admit I did cry when Rafe died.Truly a wonderful love story.
5,GREAT story!,"What I really liked about this book is how the author captures the emotions of a woman with a horrible upbringing and lost herself even more in a loveless marriage, but manages to be strong for her child to ensure she does not suffer the same fate. The main female character shows a great deal of strength, so I really appreciated that part of the story. The best part of the main male character was his ability to maintain chivalry. Great love story. Easy read but hard to put down!"
3,"Great Information, Depressing Read","The information in this book is extremely important, and well worth anyone's time to read. The authors are frank and their examples are wide-ranging. If you're not already familiar with the deception of the PR industry that reaches every corner of modern life, this will be an eye opener.That said, I can only give this three stars because I found it very hard to get into. The page format is dense and the tone (appropriately) cynical, making this a depressing read I took best in small bites. Although it was logically organized, I often felt like it was rather jumpy, skipping through examples without any fluid connector or smooth transitioning.All things considered, it should make everyone's must read list but probably won't be one of the more enjoyable reads on the list."
5,Love or Hate,"This book is like a Michael Moore movie. Like it or hate it, you'll find that the topics this book poses are worth exploring in conversation. Additionally, it'll bring you to look at the media in a different way.Read this to learn about the ""darker side of PR"". Great and easy read.iKnow"
2,Sensational title but superficial review on the pr industry,"The description and the title caught my attention when I read the book myself I missed the red line and the hard facts behind the stories they quote. It might be good for naive people who do not know how the media industry, pr and communications work , but for someone who is in the game its rather attention catching superficial stuff."
2,Toxic writing,"This book is so one sided that it's nearly worthless. Stauber and Rampton accuse the PR industry of presenting cooked facts to convince the public. Ironically they do the same thing, just on the other side of the coin."
5,If only this book were standard curriculum in the schools!,"This book is one of the most eye-opening things I have ever read, and given how much I read that is saying a lot! As a person who has worked in PR as a lobbyist (in my case for a state university), I was already somewhat acquainted with, and disgusted by, the general processes used by the industry. This book, however, put a whole new spin on things. The concrete examples of some of the PR fiascos that have been used on the American people were depressingly explicit. Yes, this book is one-sided. It never pretends not to be. It is also a must-read for anyone who views the media. If you read this book, you'll never read a newspaper the same way again. Does the book add to one's cynicism? Yes, but sometimes cynicism is a preservational force. This is one of those times."
4,open up and say ahhhhh,"an enlightening collection of articles that expose the PR scandals and ongoing campaigns of misinformation that cover our brains like so much toxic slime.The information is intelligently presented and serves as a primer on knowing exactly what is going on. Like the ""War on Drugs,"" we unfortunately buy into way too much propaganda and yet we still call ourselves a ""free"" society.Libertarians and Ralph Nader wannabes everywhere should seriously consider ordering and reading this thorough and strangely entertaining work of illumination.It misses a point for being kinda pricey for its size (compare with ""Everything You Know is Wrong."") Ironic - given its subject matter of being duped.I'm glad I got it, though.Just say Know!!!"
4,Good for those starting out,"I really liked this book. The projects are simple and easy to follow. While more expierenced crafters will find some easier projects to work in between longer ones, the person just starting out in the craft and as a crafter will find the book very useful."
5,Even my 5 year-old daughter loves it.,"This CD has it all, from banjo and mandolin solos to an incredible acapella on the 7th track. (My daughter wont be driven to school now without hearing that song.) Every song flows with melody and ""down-home"" lyrics that provide hours of effortless listening."
1,Don't bother..,"As a fan of Trading Spaces this was the first book I saw out with the Trading Spaces name on it, so I bought it up but quick. Wow.. I cannot say how much I was disappointed. This book was a very VERY entry level book on color. I had no interest in much of the book, as the color schemes were too off the wall for me. A better book on color would be Home Decorating for Dummies or the Color Directory. One could go to an elementary art class and learn the information within this book. Total disappointment. I could have read it in the store and gotten the exact same information I took away with me. Avoid!"
3,"Try Martha Stewart's ""Decorating with Color"" Instead","While this book will give you a lot of great examples, it doesn't tell you exactly how to put the pieces together. If you want to learn how to do it, read Martha Stewart's ""Decorating with Color"" instead. Martha's book will actually teach you how to use the color wheel to select colors that will complement your home and each other, while this Trading Spaces book really just shows you some before/after photos from the shows."
3,"Flans revive, pero no renace...","Flans está de nuevo en el mercado, esto es grandioso para todos los que algún día fuimos admiradores de ellas,entonces tener este CD será básico,pero tenemos que tomar en cuenta que quizas esperabamos oir algo diferente,algo más maduro o evolucionado y esto no pasó, el CD es bueno, porque mantiene su estilo antiguo de canciones fresas, pero no pensaron que la gente que antes compraban sus discos ahora crecieron y maduraron y las letras de este disco parecen quedarse en algo pasado,sus voces se oyen iguales de bien, la musica es maravillosa, pero si esperan oir letras profundas e inteligentes,no las encontrarán pues éstas chicas ahora mujeres casadas con hijos trataron de revivir un antiguo estilo y no se renovaron en nada musicalmente, aunque fisicamente estan más bellas que antes...Si quieren escuchar un disco para recordar a las tres chicas de antes, entonces este CD les gustará,pero no esperen más...porque no lo encontrarán."
5,"Good Comeback, Great music for these plastic times","Flans has been one of the most complete and best examples of Mexican Pop from 1985 to 1990. When they split up, they left a big gap for musical quality, and now they've come back with their best strength and more maturity as ever. Maybe this CD could be too corky for young audiences, but for us people who grew with them, and for anyone that loves good refreshing music, this is the best thing! ""Tu ves"" is the best if you're in love or longing for one, ""Tu eterna pesadilla"" and ""Rufino"" are the best examples of classic Flans' dance and fun songs, and with ""Ay"" they show what we could expect in a near future ... great new rythms and more mature lyrics. Hope that they continue their careers as a group for a few more years, we wanted good music again! Great buy and a good reason to learn spanish!"
5,Music,"I have always like Grover Washington. Mind bending, soothing and make you want to get up an boogie. Grover Washington was one of my Dads favorites too."
5,He Will Be Missed but What A Talent,Grover Washington jr was a Great Talent.This set HighLights his Overall Depth.His Music Paved a Way for Many Artists of Today.This is a Must.
5,Wha'cha think..? To infinity and beyond..?,"They've gotta really be jammin' up in heaven, now. Roger, Curtis and Grover playing ""Mister Magic"" has gotta be a showstopper."
2,started off good but lost me,"I really enjoyed the beginning of the book and really liked Adam but Miranda just irritated me. I felt for her after all she had been through but I didn't like how she treated Adam. I really didn't like her snobbish attitute toward him being a handyman and therefore would not fit it, was she protecting him or herself. I liked Jason but really didn't get the thing with the 18-year olds...seems to me like they were stuck in there as a statement on having protected sex."
3,Watch Storage Chest,"I purchased this item as a Christmas present for my husband as he is an avid watch collector and I also puchased a pricey watch from [...] and wanted something nice to store it in. The product arrived on time and was very nice looking. Unfortunately, the handles to the drawers fell off the first time I used them. They are attached with very tiny screws which obviously aren't able to hold the handles in. Would be a great product if the manufacturer fixes that problem."
4,watch box,"I gave this box to my husband for Christmas. It is beautiful. His watches look great in it. The inside is made of a nice vinyl and the pillows that you put the watches around are made very well. The finish is glossy and makes a great display on our dresser. The only reason I gave it only a 4 was because it would have been nicer if it had been made out of solid wood. Then, of coarse, it would have cost much more."
4,wow,just like uncle wiggly to be dearer to my heart.worthy of passing generation to generation.kids learn to love reading because of stories like these.
1,10 de coleccion Carlos vives,A very boring collection. I regret buying it. It lacks the soul and beautiful beat typical of Vives. All the singles are boring and slow ballads.ZZZZZZZZ
4,His best single disc collection.,"This just might be the best collection of his, depending on what you want. This is 18 tracks of original excellent ""Neil Diamond"". It's much better than his ""12 Greatest Hits"", and way better than ""The Millennium Collection"". However, only so much fits on one cd, and this is missing alot. There's also the 2-disc ""Greatest Hits 1966-1992"", and the 2-disc ""Essential Neil Diamond"", but both of those have numerous live versions of songs, some not so good, and obviously they cost more. Both are great if you don't mind 1/3 live songs. Overall, I would go with this. It's one cd, with only one live song, and the rest are the original classics. Too bad it doesn't have ""Heartlight"" though."
5,Classic Neil Diamond - and the best of his best,"This cd is choc full of Neil diamond and what he is about. There are many collections that I have heard of his, but this is by far the best. Just the extensive collection of all his best work should make this cd a masterpeice, but a booklet describing his career is thrown in as a bonus. Neil Diamond has a classic tone that has lived through decades of his work. And it is not just for the older people. I am 18 years old and I love the cd. It has a sound that no one (except my communications professor, who seems to be void of all feeling) can deny as great music. Neil at his best, there is nothing more to add."
2,Better collections out there?,"This CD is fair, but lacks some of Neil Diamond's better songs such as ""America"".... There must be a better out there."
3,The Neil Diamond Collection,"Some of my favorite songs were on the CD, but there were some that I didn't particularly like."
5,HIS BEST PERIOD,"This collection encompasses Neil Diamond's middle period, which was definately his best. I also like his early pop songs, but these tracks retain his pop sensibility in a more serious setting while never deteriorating into MoR schmaltz like some of his later work. His melodic prowess is at a peak on songs like Sweet Caroline, Cracklin' Rosie, Shilo and I Am I Said, and there's an almost spiritual undertone to some of the songs like Holly Holy. It demonstrates his authenticity as a great songwriter and consummate vocalist, and his willingness to experiment on numbers like e.g. Soolaimon. The Collection is a great listening experience showcasing quality music from the golden age of pop."
4,Sturdy and well-built toy,Purchased this toy as a gift for my star-wars crazed cousin three continents away. I was skeptical about the stability and quality of the product given the curious pose of the figurine. However I am happy to state that the toy looked every bit like the picture in the amazon shop and was surprisingly stable and with impressive detail for a mass-produced rubber/plastic toy. Totally satisfied with the purchase and the cousin loves it too.
5,Bosch Colt base,This Bosch Colt router base fits just as it should. I did not need to adjust anything. I bought 2 of them . One to mount a larger base plate on and another to replace one that had been dropped and is no longer flat. I waited until the price dropped below $20.00 each. I am happy with them both as well as the Colt router.
3,Not what I expected,"In a book called A History of Pi, I was, perhpas at fault, to expect more than simply a history lesson. As a graduate student in science I was interested in more of a discussion of how pi arises so much in all areas of mathetmatics, especially in areas that seem to have nothing to do with circular geometry. What I did get was a history of mathematics, often biased, especially against the Romans. While interesting, this book was unsatisfying and reminds me of the boring, yet worthwhile history lessons I recieved in high school."
2,Ideology with a little math...,"I find it very difficult to appreciate this book. While I'm very interested in the subject matter and thought much of the mathematics was interesting, I found the author's wholesale plugging of his ideologies unpleasant, insulting and out-of-place.I am simply not used to reading a math book (popular or otherwise) filled with vitriol for the UN, Socialism, Communism, the Romans, environmentalists or any of the other pet peeves the author seems to have.Mathematics is a subject of pure reasoning. I find the author's constant ideological interjections distracting and a worrying sign of his rigidity of thinking. I'd recommend one pass over this book and keep moving along..."
2,Not worth the effort,"Some interesting things I didn't know.However, the author goes on several rants about topics not at all relevant to the matter at hand.I'm sure there are better products to be found."
3,Ignore everything else and focus in Maths..,"The 3 stars only for the maths in the book...Beckman is a bit obsessed in his writing,much like an adolescent sometimes.He doesnt like Russians,so what?He despises Aristotle...hmmm..no comment ...anyway ,this book is worth reading ONLY for the maths...nothing else"
2,entertaining but obnoxious,The author sounds like someone I'd love to meet at the Oak Bar for a few martinis--but over a book's length his initially amusing tantrums and diatribes about the fools of history (of whom in his opinion the Romans seem to have been the most numerous) start to wear thin. They're also not true.
2,Mentions pi roughly every pi pages.,"If I wanted to read about the Roman empire, I'd read a book about the Romans. If I wanted an anticommunist diatribe, I'm sure I could find that too.The book is full of asides and they're longer than the material about pi. What's there is not bad, I suppose, but I was severely irritated by Beckmann's inability to keep to his topic."
5,Sorry he's gone.,"Beckmann died in 1992. I love this book. Whatever needed saying, Beckmann said it. A great engineer, a great man, a darn good writer. He wanted only to demonstrate that without the ground-breakers in science and technology, there would be far fewer reviewers in this world."
4,Pi and its place in history,"This book is a good read whether or not you have a mathematical background. The author provides lots of historical context during the times of major developments in the understanding of pi throughout the centuries. All in all, a good read. And if you are a teacher of mathematics, it provides a good classroom supplement."
2,"Makes me laugh, though it's not supposed to be funny","Who would have thought that a book about the history of a transcendental could be so politicized! He wastes an entire chapter railing about how he thinks the Romans were just a bunch of dicks. He shows that the Archimedes Screw is still in use today, but not without claiming that Egyptian leaders ""think it more important to destroy Israel than provide their people with modern irrigation."" And it just keeps going. I roll my eyes and snigger at the sheer irrelevance of his politicizing, but there's plenty of other books about pi that stay on subject and don't waste time editorializing."
3,"small slice of pi, big helping of Beckmann","This book is more of a chance for Petr Beckmann to give his personal opinions on historical regimes and figures than an exposition of the history of pi. That's not all bad - much of what he has to say is interesting and on target. I really enjoyed his skewering of Aristotle, the Romans, and the Spanish; as well as the homage to his heroes Archimedes, Newton, and Euler. But go in with your eyes open: pi is a sideline, not the main event.The book also comes across as quite dated in two respects: First, Beckmann has a hard time writing more than a few pages without vehemently slamming the Soviet regime. Unfortunately, these diatribes border on McCarthyism. Second, the section on computer computation of pi is decades out of date.I found the math somewhat terse and not particularly well explained. Some of the derivations were quite difficult to follow.All in all, this is an interesting book, but not for anything to do with pi!"
1,An irritating little book,"I agree with the majority here:- there are some interesting little anecdotes. BUT it is written by a small minded person. All cultures are either ""Good"" or ""Bad"". He reveals his pro-zionist anti-christian/anti-communist/anti-most things philosphy on every possible occasion. This is quite out of place in a mathematical book. Could do better!Jeremy Boden"
2,Beckmann -- Yet Another Professor Making UC Boulder Look Bad,"Beckmann, a former professor at UC Boulder, should've known better. Of course, what should we expect from someone who spent most of his life trying to debunk the theory of relativity?As many of the reviews have stated, Beckmann spends a lot of time discussing his pet political opinions and not a lot of time actually discussing pi. His tone is horrible and most of his asides aren't only unrelated to his arguments, but completely unsupported. Although I agreed with a lot of his opinions, they had no place in a book about the history of mathematics.If you're looking for a general history on mathematics with a lot of hyperliberal rants, then this might be the book for you."
4,3.1 stars... rounded up!,"This research could not have been more economically true to the title of the work. A history reads like a collective relay race in an effort to square the circle; complete with methods, computations and their respective diagrams. As prose this could be called piece-biographical and selectively-historical as diviners of Pi are recognized for their progress. From modern computer models to the monte carlo method Pi itself decides that a final unbounded quantity is the best solution in searching and researching for an answer. Accented with witty insight 'Pi' never goes flat and can be enjoyed even without a strong mathematical background. Recommended!"
5,An history of pi and of mathematics worth reading,"This a very educative summary of the history of pi put in context with the development of mathematics.There are still a few mistakes and typos, and the book could be updated with the latest news on mathematics, for instance on Fermat's last theorem and the 4-colour theorem, etc. which have all been solved by now.I find extremely interesting the information we find in this book to contrast the attitude of Aristotle who did not care about experimental evidence to say the least and who made arbitrary (philosophical) statements, some of them totally stupid, and the attitude of Gallileo who understood that we have to observe nature in order to understand how it works.I very much enjoyed reading it, and I recommend it to everyone who wants to see the beauty of scientific thought and all the damage done over the centuries by ignorant politicians of all kinds."
3,Good beginner work out,"If you're just starting back working out, this is a good place to get going as it's broken down into different levels. If you want a real work out and like Bob, go for his Inside Out Method dvds, they are like Insanity!"
3,so-so,this will not be my regular go-to work out- but I will use periodically- intermediate but a decent workout overall
4,Great workout,"This workout made me sweat! It has contestants from the show, so you know it is something everyday, average people can do. Now I know how much they kick their rears on the show because this is not an easy workout and it is nonstop."
5,What a workout!,"I love this DVD, actually all of the Biggest Loser DVD's! Bob is a GREAT instructor, and I think he is motivating enough, but not too hardcore or annoying. I workout 6 days/week and do a lot of weight lifting and cardio, and this is the only DVD in months that has made me sore the next day. I highly recommend it!!!"
4,Beginner Boot Camp,"It's an ok video. Not really rehearsed, looks like they taped in one day. If you never really excerised or like the show you'll love the dvd. If your more experienced you should skip this one."
1,Ripped off,When I went to view this DVD it did not work I was so disappointed. This is the first time ever I bought an item and felt ripped off.
5,New condition as promised,"Received new as promised. Took a little longer to arrive than I would have expected, but still within the allotted time frame given."
3,Ehhh They could have done better,This wasnt the best dvd put out there by Bob. I've tried all the Biggest Loser dvds and this is my least favorite. I dont like the dark scenery and I dont think it pushed me hard enough. Bob is actually annoying this time around and so is that cheesy grin on Ally's face. Im tired of staring at her already but he keeps drawing attention to her...UGH! Its still a decent workout but its almost like he is running out of ideas. Dont spend over 10 bucks for this. The other Biggest Loser dvds are a lot more challenging and worthwhile!
5,I loved it!,I am a college student and this DVD is great for a quick effective workout!! Yes Bob's counting is off but who cares! You will be sore the next day regardless. I pair this with Jillian's 6 week six pack and I feel so energized. Great DVD to get you back into working out.
5,wonderful help,so excited to have gotten this. it has been very helpful on my way to weight loss thanks. this is a must buy
4,Biggest Loser never disappoints,"As usual, the Biggest Loser did not let me down. This video has different workouts to go with your fitness level and moved along to keep things exciting."
3,Amateur quality,"Although I enjoy having ""real"" people do the workout, these folks were out of sync frequently, making them hard to follow. The counting of the repetitions was almost never the same for both sides of the body. The exercises were good, but Amy Dixon offers much better routines."
4,Good workout,"This is a good workout. I think Jillian's 30 day shred is ultimately a better work out, but it's nice to have both DVDs to have some variety."
4,Awesome!,"I've loved this DVD! It has produced real results. It's actually forming muscles I didn't know I had and has helped me get rid of weight I couldn't have before. The workouts are pretty intense and take some working up to, but it'seasy to modify it to your own level until your ready. It's especially good on the legs and arms. My arms have never been in better shape and I've been getting comments left and right on how great my legs look. I'd definitely reccommend this DVD!"
5,It works!,It was the first workout program that actually worked and saw results almost immediately! They are real people that struggle with weight and are easy to relate to.
3,hard on the knees,"I have Jillian Michaels 30 Day shred and Cardio Max and I enjoy them both. However after using them for 3 months I was getting bored. I saw this DVD in the store and picked it up for 10.00 I did the warm up and levels 1 and 2 and I did work up a great sweat, but there is a lot knee bends, lunges, etc....and I have bad knees so I just have to modify those a bit, but it's annoying as I want to be able to do it all. Also....Allie is a total pet and watching her gets on my nerves, but I just try to ignore her....although Bob always points her out ....urgh! It's still an okay DVD for your money....just watch the knees."
5,Awesome!,"Designed for heavier folks, so it isn't the kind of workout you look at once, decide you can't possibly do it and never use again. You get to customize your workout, doing only the portions you want to. 20 minutes goes by pretty quickly because Bob (the trainer) keeps changing it up and keeps you moving, alternating between upper and lower body workouts so one part of your body doesn't get too tired."
5,Great workout for all,The Bootcamp workout is great for all levels of fitness. Your able to customize it according to the level you desire. It's nice to see a workout video contain people of all sizes and fitness levels. Bob keeps it real!
5,great workout,"Love this product, Not only because I love the show and the trainer but because is a great workout, keeps you sweating and going through out the entire time. so far I'm on level 2 which is a killer workout; in this level you can really feel how good your progressing and that changes in your body are really happening."
4,Great workout except for the cueing,"You will definitely sweat with this workout, unless you are in top form, in which case you might find this mildly invigorating. I am a retired senior citizen, and exercise daily, and found I could keep up, but I did find this video a true workout. I liked the fact you could program how much you wanted to do by choosing 1 to 3 workouts, and then adding the warm-up and cool-down. The instruction by Bob is very clear, but the cueing is awful. (I would have given this 5 stars were it not for the bad cueing, and giving it 4 stars was a stretch, too, but the workout itself is soooo good.) You may be keeping up with the group exactly, but when the camera goes from Bob showing something back to the group, you will be off (or, rather, they are off). This is constant and very annoying throughout the entire video. But the workout itself gets a #10. I hope the video company redoes this, because the editing/cueing job is truly awful. ."
3,"Good, not great","I am a Biggest Loser devotee; i have all the DVD's and have gotten rid of (and kept off) over 40 pounds. That said, this is my least favorite workout program. It does not have as many workouts as the others (3 as opposed to up to 6), the workouts themselves are not overly challenging, especially the 3rd segment, and i miss the folks who are active in the program, as opposed to those who have already completed it. There are no ""special features"" like the first 2, and it's just not as challenging. I will definitely keep buying this series, but would not recommend this particular DVD."
4,Be prepared to get out of breath!,I just tried this dvd today for the first time and OMG I was about to die. I consider myself in moderately good shape but today I felt like I was out of shape doing this workout. I had to pause the tape a few times to catch my breath! I do agree with some of the other reviews in that Heba looks like she is being forced to be there and she only gives half effort and Allie does look like a show off. Although I do give her props for being able to finish the reps when I couldn't. I rated this one 4 stars because it is challenging but I thought it could've been a little better. I get just as good of a workout with Jillian's 30 day shred and I can actually finish the first and second steps of hers.
4,I enjoy this one,"I really enjoy the instruction from Bob. He can be very motivating. The workout is fun and by just adding more weight you can increase the intensity. I do wish it had some more ab specific exercises, but overall it provides a great workout."
2,Boring,This didn't really excite me. I bought Jillian McMichaels Trouble Zones and they had a very similar workout. In all the seller shipped on time package was new but I just wasn't excited with it. Passing it along to my little sister.
5,Great workout!!!,I have only done the first day of week one but this workout has me sore but feeling great!!! I love the fact that they have real people with weight problems struggling and modifying the steps so that I don't feel like giving up if they can do it so can I!!
3,Leslie Is Better,"I have been trying to find a more intense Strength training aide to go along with Leslie S. 2 mile walk DVD. This, isn't it for me. It doesn't seem to have a good rhythm or serious focus for the 'Viewer' participant. It's quite hard to find a way to fit yourself into what they are doing, as opposed to them bringing 'you' in. Just my opinion. Will keep searching. :)"
3,"Too dark, just wasn't thrilled","First off, the set was too dark, making it difficult to see what was going on. I just didn't feel like I got as good as a workout as I did with Jillian's Shred or Jackie Warner's Circuit training. I guess because I was expecting more, I was disappointed. I may keep it in my rotation and do it occasionally, but it is not a 'go to' workout video for me."
1,Marginal Exercise- annoying teacher and bad music...,"Well, it does get you up and moving, but the video is such a turn-off you will want to turn it off before you work up a sweat! The music is like a high school band warming up, and the music doesn't even have a beat, and on occation when it does, it doesn't even match the work out!The lead boot camp teacher has a shy personality and does not make the work out fun.Pretty Lame!"
5,"i needed motivation , that s just what I got !!","I know what to do,why am I not doing it? Well that is the question.Raphael helped me to keep on track, to stay motivated and he gave me advises that help me get faster results.I open the book anywhere and like in a bible , i find answers. I bought this book to many of my friends and they all thanked me for it . I can see the difference in their lfestyle , and i know that soon their jeans will be lose too."
3,"Good value for money, but.....","Good value for the money, but not all that engaging. When I purchased this for my son, I thought it used dialogue taken from the actual movie. My son had a Pirates of the Caribbean CD storybook that had that and he absolutely loves this. He doesn't seem to care about this one or seem that interested. He doesn't ask for this to be put on like the other one. The narrator is a woman, and most of the dialogue is from male characters, so it's not that great."
4,Great for a little quiet time,"I really enjoy these CD storybooks (we have two different ones). They have been especially helpful for me when my 2 yr. old was boycotting naptime. Instead of insisting that he sleep (and then paying the price when he was awake 'til 10:30 pm!), I simply put this CD on, handed him the storybook, and initiated ""rest time."" They are long enough that he really is at rest for a decent amount of time. I do wish they had the ""turn the page"" signals for when he's a little older, but at this point he wants to flip back and forth between pages and probably wouldn't be able to keep up with the signals anyway."
5,My 10-month-old loves it!,"This is my 10 month old daughter's favorite book (and she has a LOT of books). It is very short and simple, but sweet, and the illustrations are very appealing. No matter what she is in the middle of it, be it playing or having a meltdown, if I pull out this book and start reading, she comes right over with a big smile on her face and pays close attention. For some reason, she laughs at every other page (the revealing of what kind of baby it is). It's very cute how much she enjoys it!"
4,Great Baby Animal Book,"Another wonderful John Butler book, but not our favorite. The illustrations as always, are stunning. Our daughter really likes identifying the baby animals by type, but it would be nice if the ""names"" of the babies were on each page as part of the story rather than just one page at the end of the book."
3,"advanced piano, but not too creative","The song selection in this book is very good. I especially like Jalousie (by Jacob Gade). However, I have seen better versions of the song. I don't especially like Brimhall's arranging techniques. It is not very creative; there are many chords, many of them impossible for me to reach!If you are planning to play one of these songs for a competition, I would recommend mixing two arrangements of one song together, one with many chords, and the other with arpeggios. This way, the style is varied and interesting to listen to."
5,Great for the beginner to the advanced digital cropper!,"I had read about Uleads ver 1.0 of this program, so I thought I would gamble and get ver 2.0 when it came out. I love it! It's VERY easy to use, and with the pre-made templates (in both 12x12 and 8.5 x 11) I had 4 pages complete in about 10 minutes. However, it has a vast range of abilities for photo editing and creating pages, so its not just for the beginner. An advanced user will find lots of things to play with and experiment with. I have barely scratched the surface, but I am having a grand time with it. Enjoy!"
1,Too hard to use,"I found this product clumsy and frustrating. I had a hard time building a page and I didn't like the photo editing tools. I would not recommend it...there are other scrapbook software products that are easier to use, cost less money and have many more features."
5,Can't go Wrong,I was skeptical buying a phone from Amazon and if anyone else is do not worry about it. I bought this phone from Amazon and it was exactly as advertised. ATT sells this phone for $250 with a new 2 year agreement. Amazon sold it for $.01. The phone arrived brand new as described and quickly less than 3 days.I took my sim card from my previous phone put it in the new phone and was making and receiving phone calls in under 5 minutes. If you are upgrading phones and eligible for a new phone go to Amazon first and see if the phone you like is available...you can't go wrong.
1,The nadir of 80's/90's fiction,"This is the epitome of 90's minimalism: impeccably written, utterly devoid of heart or soul. There isn't one risky sentence in this book: it's all so careful, so risk-free, so . . . dead. If you're into the whole Ron Carlson/Richard Ford thing, go for it. Otherwise, look elsewhere for rich, challenging fiction."
3,gift for my daughter,"She claims it was helpful, but who knows if she was just saying that to be polite."
3,hard to read in a dimly lit room,"The clock is ok, but it should hung in an area with adequate lighting. I bought if for my mom, and she has a hard time seeing it unless she is directly in front of it."
5,Salsa buena,I enjoy this music can listen all day long it's soo good I purchased it for gym workout motivation music
3,This is a must read for campfire entertainment,"We kept reading this book looking for how to have fun on a camp trip, and before long we were laughing at the content that we realized we were having fun. While this book offered little practical advice about having fun with kids during camping, reading the book aloud with your children certainly provided comic relief. Very entertaining book, but we're sure the author meant well."
4,CONFESSIONS OF A SUPER HERO,"THIS WAS AN AMAZING MOVIE DOCUMENTARY. IT DEPICTS THE LIFE OF MANY PEOPLE WHO LIVE THEIR ENTIRE LIVES AND MAKE THERE LIVELY HOOD BY PANHANDLING ON THE STREET AS SUPER HEROES. IT IS BOTH JOYOUS AND SAD HOW THESE PEOPLE LIVE IN THIS FANTASY WORLD, BUT HAVE VERY STRICT CODE OF ETHICS. WORTH WATCHING TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SEE ANOTHER SIDE OF LIFE. AND CERTAINLY TO ANY SUPER HERO FANS."
4,Worth watching,"This is a truly a sight! The guy who dresses like Superman actually thinks he is related so some actress I have never heard of? The lady who is Wonderwoman and the black guy who is the Hulk are the true talented ones. But if you really want to buy this, check out the guy who kinda looks like George Clooney. Two words Whack job."
4,"HEARTBREAKING, SAD, FUNNY, PART OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE","The engaging tale focuses on four wanna be stars who end up wearing superhero costumes to gain fame. They spend most of their working time asking for tips as they entertain the tourists and locals. The guy playing Superman is nicely eccentric and ends up getting married to his therapist/advisor friend later. Batman, who is already married, is unstable; the Wonder Woman character is frustrated big time and the impoverished Hulk character is probably the happiest of the four. When Batman starts yelling at tourists for not tipping him and the Superman guy reminds him that tips aren't required you can see things are about to get out of hand. There's a good fusion of superhero worship with trying to make it in Hollywood. I would say the emotional range is heartbreaking to funny to looking at a car accident on the road. It's part of the human experience in action. MY GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: early September 2011 (streamed)."
4,Bold Vision & Careful Planning,"I enjoyed this book. It's a short read but certainly with some substance. Ernest Shackleton is, of course, a famous traveler and explorer and there is little new information in the book on the actual subject of his travels. However, the author, who I believe is Shackleton's relative of sorts, does a decent job of putting his experiences in the context of today's management practices. The author analyzes specific actions by the explorer (selection of prospective employees, using public relations to advance his cause and fundraise, etc.) and summarizes take-aways in a simple and straightforward fashion. More than anything, the book made me want to go out and find our more about the man!"
4,"Leadership, Crises Management, Being more Human","These are just a few subjects on which to gain insight in this wonderful book. No matter your vocation, there are ""take aways"" that the reader will be able to employ tomorrow. Read it and use it. Worth reading every few years."
2,A Very Dull Book for an Important Subject,"I guess you can derive as much pleasure from reading this book as you would from The Joy of Cooking. I am sure there is a great deal to be learned about leadership skills from Shackleton's expeditions, as is evidenced by the italicized and boldfaced summary statements throughout the book. These are great ingredients of leadership success, but somehow Shackleton the leader fails to leap out of the pages of the book as a living hero. I have never read a book about a great leader written in such dry prose. Maybe the project was doomed by the authors' objective of culling some neat points from various accounts of the great explorer's adventures for today's self-improvement book market. Has anyone been inspired to be a great culinary artist by reading The Joy of Cooking?"
4,Uncommon common knowledge,"I have heard it said many times that management is common knowledge and this book reaffirms those sentiments. But common knowledge is often forgotten when adversity happens or when things become too busy. This book takes the effort of reaffirming all those things that are important to leadership in adverse times. It covers many of the things Sir Ernest Shackleton faced in many of his polar expeditions and how he learned from past mistakes. It talks of his planning, expenditures, morale focus, and other things he felt were to make for a successful trip. It also talks about how one can set what success is, where sometimes reaching the South Pole is not the best idea when you focus on bringing everyone through to the end with you.I recommend this book just for an inspirational aspect. It is well written if occasionally hokey when they pull out leadership bullet points, but still a good read."
1,Really bad story telling weaved with really poor leadership examples,"I found this to be an impossible read. The story telling is horrible IMHO. I know this is a remarkable story but the authors butchered it. And the attempt to weave in leadership lessons further ruined the story telling. The authors hit you over the head with obvious leadership lessons rather than focusing on telling a good story. I'm amazed at the positive reviews here. I almost never stop reading a book without finishing it, but this was one exception. My time was too valuable to waste on this."
4,Shackleton's Way,"If you want an in depth analysis of Shackleton or any other leader, go take a course, read the volumes of books on the subject, invest the effort elsewhere. Don't expect to have an in-depth analysis effectively accomplished in 200 pages.If you want a light, entertaining, interesting read of an incredible story, touching on various leadership points, then you will find this book worthwhile.If you are looking for a bit of spark to investigate Shackleton a bit more, then you will find this book worthwhile.Shackleton was a very capable leader of expeditions... not a Saint. If you are looking for a look into his personal life and any shortcomings in it, you won't find it in this book... but then again, I don't think it's called Shackleton's Family Way: A Critical Account of His Family Life."
2,"Great leader, not so great leadership book","Ernest Shackleton accomplished arguably superhuman things. He was good at selecting, cajoling and inspiring men. How he brought his crew back alive from such a frozen, forbidding world, is one of the amazing miracles of the past two hundred years.Yet a close, hard look suggests that the leadership lessons to be learned are limited for most readers. The authors try too hard to take each Shackleton episode or act as a lesson tobe learned and applied yet these lessons are not as clear as the authors might want to suggest nor are the lessons necessarily generalizeable to modern life or commerce. After reading the entire book, little remains to explain Shackleton's theory or practice of leadership, just a lot of anecdotes and incidents. Shackleton and his leadership remain inscrutable.An amazing story, yes. An amazing leadership book, I think not."
5,Wonderful book,"A wonderful book with a great deal to say. This book, Barry Maher's ""Filling the Glass: The Skeptic's Guide to Positive Thinking in Business"" and Stephen Covey's ""Seven Habits of Highly Effective People"" are the three books I'm currently recommending to everyone I know."
4,The Greatest Album Ever?,I have been a huge fan of Genesis since the 70's and this has always been one of my favorite albums. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is it doesn't have the live version of Suppers Ready with Gabriel on vocals. I guess it would have had to have been a double album. Seconds out has SR but with Collins on vocals. The Box set Genesis Archives Vol. 1 does include the live version of SR with Gabriel on vocals I have read.
2,Not worth the money,Velcro inside the waist hurts my skin. Dont like the fit on the top. It would have been nice to have zipper at the bottom so you can do different things with it.
4,so far so good,"Let me start by saying I have NOT worn them in the weather yet, I bought them for a ski trip that is coming up in a few weeks. I CAN say they fit like a dream and flatter the heck out of my backside :) They certainly feel like they are going to keep me nice and warm. I was instantly toasty as soon as I put them on and all I was doing was checking out the look in the mirror, they are SO SHARP!"
5,The Best,"I LOVE this cd. I listen to all the songs. One of the songs has a 404 playcount on my itunes. If you love sugarcult, get this cd. It is much better than their newer stuff."
4,Swell parties are all about the fun,"I tend to like to entertain in different ways and was hesitant to take tips from a book when I got this as a hostess gift. Was happy to see some of my standby tricks like ordering in all the food, hosting clothing swaps and having a bash at a just moved in apt before the unpacking -- but some of their suggestions are just brilliant, like having a hangover brunch or bribing the ice cream truck driver to stop at your place or setting up a champagne cocktail bar. And I can't wait to make their Gazpacho which you can boozify by passing around a chilled bottle of pepper vodka. Yum."
2,"Completely useless in many aspects, but does have some creative ides","I enjoyed some other Swell books, so I decided to buy another one because I am having a big party this November. Bad decision. This book is almost entirely useless when it comes to anything but drinks. What if you're underage, a religious person, or simply don't drink? There were some fun ideas but, again, mostly about drinks."
1,not good - dont bother,"i can't believe i paid for another one of their stupid books - this is the last time for sure! its sooo annoying to read and their ideas are not 'fresh' or 'new.' pick up any copy of instyle, gourmet, etc. and you will see them from someone else & they even used some of the same ideas that they wrote about in the first book. just like the holiday book, the organization is terrible and it looks like they put it together in a week just to make some money. makes sense since none of cynthia rowley's clothes are sold anywhere b/c they fall apart...the only positive i have to say is at least the pictures look decent. DONT BOTHER PAYING FULL PRICE B/C I AM SURE PEOPLE WILL BE GIVING THEM AWAY ON EBAY SOON.."
4,Helped me at the right time,"Since I just retired after 33 years at one company, I wanted to read about help in what I should do in my retirement. This book gave me some good insight. I recommend it."
3,"Good, but could be better...","I bought the Cell-Grip Phone Holder to hold my Nokia phone in my car. The holder works great as far as the phone sliding easily in and out of it - but the double sided tape keeps letting go from my car's dashboard. I did follow the directions which stated to rub the area where the holder would be mounted with the enclosed alcohol wipe and wait for it to dry before applying the tape. Either the tape isn't strong enough, or my dash is somehow hindering its ability to stick. Either way, it's kind of disappointing to get in the car and find the phone lying on the floor..."
5,can't walk my dogs without it!,very nice product. re-fitted it with a ministar 1000 lumen and its great! I love all the maglite products but this size is very nice.
5,APC BE65OR Backup Battery for Home/Office Computers,"I have been very pleased with the functioning of this new battery, which replaces a Belkin Battery I had for several years. There have been two interruptions thus far in my electrical service since I installed this battery in November 2006. On both occasions there was no interruption in my ability to use my computer or any of the accessories which are also in backup through this battery. It has excellent staying power for my needs should there be future power failures."
2,Lousy Quality Control,"I bought this one two years ago at Office Depot for about $75. Here in Florida there is frequent power interruptions and I needed to protect my entertainment center with surge protection. I noticed a few months later when the power button was depressed it did not return so there was no way to turn the unit off or silence those annoying alarms. Yesterday I replaced the battery and took the unit apart to find out why the power button didn't work. Turns out they had the wrong part installed in my UPS. The push button was way too short to contact the switch on the circuit board. APC's commercial products are very good but their consumer line is junk. APC's website says this model has been discontinued so if you are purchasing this, it is already old. Be aware that replacement batteries are $40 and life is about two years. When this battery dies I'm replacing this unit for something better."
1,Poor quality control - defective unit out of the box,"Out of the box, this battery backup was making a loud buzzing sound constantly, all the time, even after over 36 hours plugged in. Initially I thought it was the sound it makes while charging but it turns out it was defective. It seems like APC has quality control issues, big time.I am returning my unit to Amazon for a refund. I contacted APC and they wanted to replace it for me however I prefer to buy another product instead since I do not trust APC's workmanship."
1,Don't order this...they send the wrong model,I ordered this because it said it was model BE650G. They sent a repackaged BE650R. I returned it for an exchange specifying I wanted the BE650G and they sent me another repackaged BE650R. This is a previous generation of the product.
3,Works well,This back up works well. The negative wire must first be connected to the battery prior to plugging the unit into the wall outlet. This neg. wire was too long and did not fit well behind the battery cover. APC needs to work on this design. Hopefully the bent wire will not cause any issues.
2,Not as advertised - read below,"The title and description are misleading. This features only FOUR OUTLETS that offer the UPS. The other four outlets feature SURGE PROTECTION ONLY. I would not have purchased this item if I had known that information ahead of time.That said, the unit itself offers 15 minutes of battery life in the event of a brownout/power outage and it has worked for me when I did have such an outage. I still wouldn't have bought it for only four outlets..."
5,Great Product,"Only problem is, don't buy it from Amazon: its horridly overpriced. I picked mine up at Staples, this exact model, for 46 dollars.So, buy this UPS if you need one, it works like a charm, just not from here."
4,Terrific book for the 4 - 7 year old,This book was a big hit in my kindergarten classroom last Halloween. The illustrations are colorful and vivid and the text simple yet engaging.
5,Favorite,"My 3-year-old just loves this book. He chants the witches' taunts over and over, and he likes looking for the black cat in the illustrations. He refers to me as Leona from time to time..."
2,I stand alone,"I am very surprised that anyone can shave with this style razor.despite all the good reviews I read, I just can't figure out how the three head system is supposed to work???? incredibly awkward!the motor is extremely quiet, and the battery lasts a long time, but otherwise I would have to say that this will be the last time I stray from the straight head razors.anyone want to buy a slightly used Norelco?"
4,A very good shaver,"The 8846XL shaver is light and easy to hold. It doesn't require use of lotion or gel to give a good shave. To improve on its performance, a pre-shave is helpful."
4,Miracle Birth Stories,I could relate to every story having been in all those situations. Being a parent of a micro-preemie is an isolating feeling. It helps to know there are others who are out there going through the same thing you are and are surviving it!
2,Not ideal for students,"R.A. McNeal's HERODOTUS: BOOK I is a text of Clio prepared after the scholar's examination of the papyri together with a commentary. An introduction is included that discusses the history of the text, with some nice details such as photographs of pages from Papyrus No. 89 and Laurentianus.Unfortunately, the text is set in a rather unattractive typeface, limiting readability. Before I picked up this book, I was making some use of the Oxford Classical Text, and the difference is painfully clear. The commentary isn't as helpful as other student readers I have read.If you are a student reading Herodotus, I'd recommend J. H. Sleeman's reader HERODOTUS: BOOK I (Bristol Classical Press, 2003), which is nicely typeset in Oxonia and contains very useful footnotes."
5,Nerd Pleasure & Beyond,"One wouldn't think one could be so fascinated with the lives of insects but one can. I bought this book because it is referenced in Annie Dillard's 1972 narrative Pilgrim At Tinker Creek. I am now fascinated with the intricate evolution and adaptation of insects. I've been reading this book in short intervals for a dose of appreciation of life and just how amazing survival and growth really is, though we seldom think of it. Edwin Way Teale writes with the background of both a historian and an entomologist and sprinkles his descriptions of these insects with doses of clever reference and awe. Enjoyable to nerds, nature lovers and those who wish to see beyond the simple buzzing or crawling presence of insects all around us in the millions every day."
5,Dawning is an Existential Thrill Ride,"Dawning is an existential thrill ride that unnerves fears of the most common and destructive sort, those that involve the disintegration of a nuclear family unit. Dawning is an important contribution to the modern Independent film lexicon, invoking dark and nuanced aspects of the human psyche, while engaging the audience in, what for most of us is an uncannily familiar situation. When watching this film, we are reminded that life, death, and family are all part of our shared human condition, whether we like it or not."
3,Egyptian New Kingdom Battles!,"This book discusses the New Kingdom wars, estimating how much was needed to supply the units, the speed, distances involved, and the military equipment. It had a lot more detail than I needed at times."
3,"A ""must have"" series that would have deserved much more quality","Growing up with ""Blossom"" I absolutely love this series and it is certainly a ""must have"" for me and all the other fans out there. The extras and interviews are also very good. Regarding all these points this DVD collection would get the full five-star rating from me, no doubt about that, and I will certainly also buy the additional seasons on DVD as soon as they come out. So why did I only give a three-star rating? Because of the picture quality (or, rather, the lack of it). Unfortunately the picture quality is much closer to an aged VHS tape than to a new DVD. This wonderful series would have deserved a much better treatment."
5,BLOSSOM is back!!!,I loved it the first time around I saw it & still love it now. Hopefully SHOUT FACTORY will release the rest of the seasons SOON!!!!!
4,A Great Primer about the Planets,"A nice, quick, and easy way to introduce the planets and solar system to young minds. My daughter became quite interested in the planets and learning about the planets. It is a good family time project for young and old minds alike.Drawbacks are that it is not very sturdy and easily breaks. We lost the Sun shortly after completing the model. Also, for obvious reasons, the scale in size and distance is not accurate. But this detail is lost on young minds and only older geeks like me notice it. However, with all the drawbacks, the family time used is well worth getting this item."
1,8 planets only!!!??,"We got the same Glowing in the dark Solar System for Christmas. It has the same packaging, looks the same, but Pluto is totally missing from it! There are only 8 planets orbiting the sun and even in the description they talk about only eight, not mentioning Pluto at all! So when you buy this product in a store (we have it from Michaels) or online, count the planets on the package! Luckily my 7 year old realized the missing planet himself. He has fun putting it together and painting it and won`t be confused since he knows it already, but it is very weird, since it is supposed to be a fun science product."
3,"""Nice, but not her personal best""","This is one of 3 Maire ( pronounced Moya ) Brennan's albums that I own. The music is nice, and her voice simply cannot be faulted. The only song I really don't like is ""Big Yellow Taxi"", it just doesn't fit with the mood of the album. However, this album does not move and carry me as her other 2 more recent works do: ""Perfect Time"" and ""Whisper To The Wild Water"". She shows tremendous growth in these, they take you along on a beautiful journey of sound, and are more celtic."
2,Not her best...,"I am a Celtic music fan since a long time.Love Enya, Loreena McKennit and such. But mainly CLANNAD. Great band, great atmospheres.I bought this album 2 years ago and to me it s not a great album. Apart a cople of nice tracks and her beautiful voice, this album is far away from what Clannad had to say. It s not very ""celtic"", it has some mixture of pop as well. Not her kind. Well, if you like TWO HORIZONS, well MAA is completely different.If you haven't yet, get a chance to listen to TWO HORIZONS and you will find the real MOYA. She is superb."
2,Harlem Renaissance,"A good, but very general overview, of the Harlem Renaissance. There are lots of facts and photos and it would be a very useful introductory text for high school students. It is minimally useful as an adult introduction to the subject. There are far more useful and substantive texts available."
3,Good pen,"writes well,a good value for the price,but i am slightly disappointed with the chrome finish,it lacks a smooth finish. Being a Shaeffer pen i expected it to be of much better quality.The gold plating looks good and it comes with a nice giftbox.I am giving it a 3 star rating.It is made in china."
5,mine works great. . . .A+,"Wow, mine works great, the quality if excellent. Strong material, great protection for mp3 player or media player. My speakers are fine. Nice projection and clarity at about 80%. I wouldn't go higher it gets distorted. Overall I'm really happy. I have a media player with little speakers and this is perfect for an average size room. Plus I fit my camera, accesories, two other small bags inside and I can fit plent of magazines or a couple books in the front compartment."
4,Nice bag and decent quality sound.,Really cool item for the money. Great for beach or picnic. Holds a laptop with plenty of extra room.
5,dreamy future music,this album is sooo spacy and goood. it's been one of my favorites for years now. definitely one for the strandedonadesertisland short list.
1,"Canned electronica, poorly done trip-hop music.","This CD was an extreme disappointment. I kept listening to it hoping that a certain track would pull me in, but it never happened. Key words to describe this CD are arrythmical, confused, disjointed, and annoying. I don't know what went wrong with the recording, but the entire piece sounds like it was recorded in a tin can. The drum beats sound like they were produced on a forty-dollar drum machine and the timing is all off, almost as if the beats were added as an afterthought. Also, there are these purposeless volume shifts in most of the songs that becomes quite annoying over time. The last track is fairly easy to listen to, but isn't enough to make up for the rest of this coldly disappointing CD. No more future loops for me. If you want a frame of reference on this genre, try Banco de Gaia's Maya or ONE A.D.. Future Loop is on the same label as Banco, but lacks depth and breadth."
1,A Dictionary?,This is a humorous book but beware. This is a dictionary. There is no funny stories or anything like that. There are some funny cartoons and the definitions are humorous but this is just a dictionary. Nothing else. A piece of advise. Un-less you collect dictionary's....there is no point in getting the book and is not worth your money.
5,Truly an Angel of Music,"Michael has been on the top of my list for over a decade. I love his music enough to upgrade all the cassettes I own to CD. This is certainly one of my favourite albums, such a wonderful mix of songs and emotions. He has a way of bringing out a variety of emotions. He reaches down into the core. This album is absolutely wonderful to fall asleep and awaken to. My favorite song from this album? Way too difficult to decide..."
5,All,I have liked Mr Crawford since i first seen Him in Hello Dolly. I even have my husband listening to him. I am trying to find his new CD called My Disney Favorites. Can anybody tell me when it will be out. please write me at RJCAMC1108 Thank You Arlene
5,Unique and powerful song interpreter with an envious voice.,"Crawford has perhaps the best male singing voice today. The range exhibited in ""Phantom of the Opera"" is only the introduction to his warm and sensitive interpretation of each song he sings, whether leaning towards the classical vein or executing a ""pop"" song. You don't get tired of hearing him sing."
3,Not too shabby.,"OK. Not too shabby. Now, I like Michael Crawford circa 1986. That is Michael Crawford/Phantom. He is and was and will be the only greatest Phantom. Now, keeping that in mind, there is also Brad Little, (whom I have met), but I'll pass that for now.Anyways, this CD is alright. I have had this for a very long time, and the songs are all fairly popular. He's a pretty old man, but he has a great set of lungs. Michael Crawford is a classic, and I recommend anyone who enjoys his music to check out Phantom. Of course, I am sure that most everyone who likes Michael Crawford likes him because of Phantom. Right?OK, but I could never say this man inspires me. Uh, how could you say that? This is not a five star CD by any means, and even if Michael Crawford is a good singer, he's good enough for broadway musicals and the Carnival Cruise Line, but that's about it. No offense, he can sing, but......"
3,History lesson,"Rich is a major figure in recent feminist film history, so it's great to see her book out. Still, I'm not sure that the combo (old essays + autobio narrative) works. Like a lot of people, I just read the personal/dishy stuff. The essays on their own didn't seem to hold up, or maybe they get lost in the flow.Of course, I appreciated learning the context for the texts, but I felt they could have been better as two separate books (since Rich clearly has a lot to say about her past).The only flaw was that the author sometimes seemed to have so many axes to grind, even 20+ years later. She's so committed to her view of herself as an outsider/underdog that, when you realize she's been the head of a major funding agency, you get a little suspicious. She's so aware (often justly) of the flaws of other people's positions, but you wonder what she leaves out."
1,Permanently died in 1 1/2 years,"I bought this router and its corresponding PCI wireless card about 1 1/2 years ago. I was never able to get the wireless PCI card to register this router, although it could find the neighbor's signal across the street. About 8 months ago, I purchased a MacBook and was able to get the signal on that. But after a couple months the signal kept cutting in and out. I thought it was the Mac Airport. It finally died last week. I tried resetting it and only managed to get the wired connections to register, but my MacBook couldn't find the wireless signal. I purchased a Linksys speedbooster WRT54GS to replace it and immediately noticed a difference in both speed and range. I should have dumped the Airlink months ago."
5,After a Firmware update it has been amazing.,I had some link issues for a month and finally updated the firmware. It has been running for a year and a half now with not a single failure since the update. Strong signal throughout my whole house.
1,Not comfortable,This cradle was not comfortable at all. It was too tight on the front of my prego belly and the velcros were itchy on the back.
5,Awsome Aerosmith Movie,"This was a great movie. If you love Aerosmith this movie is a must. it has the complete uncensored videos of Janie's Got a Gun, Love in an Elevator, and more... It is definatly worth it."
3,Not all hits!,"Reasonable price for this collection, but some songs were not popular hits! Why were they included?"
4,Quietly pensive countrified psychedelia,"Edith reminds me the most of Barbara Manning. She has similar vocal stylings and employs the same sort of low key charm that Barbara does. Both are among the most underrated women artists currently operating in the US, a list that includes Lisa Germano and Lida Husik.Telescopic is evocative of the best of New Zealand strum and thrum pop. Highly recommended."
1,Product Looks Great but The Balls Don't Hold Up,"The company themselves are FANTASTIC, however, all of the rings I have purchased from this particular company (the product itself) has flaws. I have extremely sensitive skin. Not an issue as all of the hoops & horseshoes are rated & are not going to break you out or cause irritation. HOWEVER, the screw in balls at the end, go metal only if you want them to last. These have chipped & cracked & there's nothing like having a piercing & having to carry around spares in your purse KNOWING it'll crack or chip & be useless. Sorry, great people to buy from but I'd stick with entirely metal units if/when you do."
1,disappointed customer,I purchased two of these sweaters for Christmas. One for my brother & one for myself. I just washed my sweater for the first time & was disappointed to see a small hole in the right armpit of the sweater. I purchased this sweater because of the great reviews about its quality and durability. I would really like to exchange it but see no way to email amazon to see if they would be willing to do that for me.
2,Not true to size,These champion hoodies i bought are not true to size. I bought XXL because i already own two that i purchased from champion direct a couple years ago. These are too tight around the chest and stomach area. If you purchase buy two sizes up for comfortable fit and you can still wear a long sleeved shirt underneath.
5,Great Hoodie - price is right...,Seller did great getting this product out quickly. The hoodie is thick and very comfortable. Just as advertised. If you want a quality and reasonably priced hoodie - this is it.
4,Cool,"Book got to me on time and safely. Was a little more damaged than expected. I believe title was ""some shelf ware""- book cover is very worn, and spin skin not attached. I expected some of that from an old book though."
3,Not what I expected,Nice LITTLE book. Almost a mini coffee table book. If I wanted a book for recipes and techniques I'd look elsewhere. A little shy on content but a pretty little book.
3,Circa Joan and David Farley,"This is quite a nice shoe with soft leather and nice workmanship. Unfortunately the shoe is not that comfortable although the heel is quite low. I think the problem lies in the design of the shoe near the buckle. It feels as if it cuts into the top of my foot. The size seems fine, a bit tight but okay with hose or thin socks."
2,Caricatures and trying too hard to be clever,"I had great expectations of this book, but have been quite disappointed. The main character is completely unlikeable and someone I didn't have any interest in ultimately. In fact, just about all of the characters, despite author-driven quirks, feel stereotypical and shallow. The book is one long, meandering weekend that feels interminable and without a point. I love literary fiction, but this just feels empty to me."
4,"Smart, oddly hopeful, and good fun","My intro to Michael Chabon. And a delight. Goofy male sensibility yet sensitive and vulnerable. Example thought: ...""most of the violence that occurs between men is the product, in one way or another, of flippancy and smart remarks""- just as our hero is about to get hit in the head with a Joe DiMaggio 36 oz bat. You root for Grady knowing he's a good soul. I hope he raises his little boy with love. I think he will.On to more Chabon work!"
3,"A fun, interesting read","Enjoyable, fun, and interesting read, though a bit dated. Good characters and some very funny scenes. Way better than the film."
4,Very Enjoyable!,"This book is very unique in its style. One of the many things I enjoyed about the book was that the characters were real. They were human, and flawed just like everybody, but as flawed as they were, they were also endearing. This story also gets to the heart of what its like to be a writer."
2,Writing Workshop Writing About Writing Workshops,"I've tried to be impressed with this book, but cannot. That Michael Chabon is a master of the language is not in doubt. What is in doubt is whether, ultimately, his story and, more importantly, his characters, are relevant. If you want to spend a weekend reading a novel about pot heads in Pittsburgh, with a touch of homosexual love interest (isn't that sweet?), then this myopic exposition is for you. The main protagonist is too pathetic, the plot too lacking in higher action, the point of view too seedy (in an unexciting sense of the word). Reading it is to feel squeezed into a drab colored, excessively confining frame. Stories about writing workshops by products of writing workshops always seem to beg the question. Mr. Chabon, take a lesson from Thom Jones -- move out into the world. Away from the classrooms and away from the excessive self absorption of the ego hominem."
2,Emotionally Detached,"There is little formally wrong with Chabon's Wonder Boys. The laughs are there, and the narrator is amusing and can turn a phrase well. Unfortunately, the novel is uneven in this regard. Very brilliant sections and followed by dull ones, where the effort seems to fall flat. The large middle section of the book involving the quirky Passover seder reads like a set piece of other seders going terribly wrong.In the end, this so-called dark musing on contemporary writing and the life it generates is curiously detached, emotionally uninvolved, and even trite. Is this the work of the ""great"" Michael Chabon?"
2,An Atrocity of American Fiction,"I was quite excited to be reading a Pulitzer Prize winning author in what he described as his ""magnum opus"": I was sincerely disappointed. For most Americans this ""Wonder Boys"" would be a mediocre or perhaps for the non-discriminating, optimistic, fundamentally nice readers it is a decent book but for those of us who seek literature and enlightenment this is not the book to read. This book sheds light on Michael Chabon's shortcomings as his uninteresting, unsympathetic characters exhibit their banal traits within an even more trite and just plain stupid plot. If you have time to read this book enter this endeavor knowing what your getting into or take my advice and don't take the gamble that you might enjoy this."
3,Depressing,"The movie seemed fairly light-hearted, but I fell into a black mood every time I picked up the book."
5,A Wonder,"Wonder Boys, by Michael Chabon is an amazing roller coaster tale of a Professor Grady Tripp weekend. The novel is both entertaining and exhilarating yet still retains that Chabon charm that The Mysteries of Pittsburgh left me with. Chabon has a real knack for writing, he creates characters who are both quirky yet somewhat identifiable. Take Grady, a forty something, chronic head, college professor, and one time wonder boy... I felt myself feeling the man's pain. Suddenly I was getting a divorce, losing my job and impregnating my lover. I especially liked James Leer the college student, what a strange little bird! The book is a page-turner that's full of insight. Some may say it is quick read, yet I took my time to savor."
5,Couldn't get enough!,The story was wild but I quickly got into the woven tale and loved the characters. This is the first Chabon book I've read and I can't wait to read more of his work. Brilliant.
4,Enjoyable story of a puer aeternus,"Michael Chabon is one of my favorite writers. This early novel, set in Pittsburgh, is about an author who is blocked, with a 2000-page manuscript he can't seem to finish, yet who nonetheless cannot rid himself of his childish ways and start taking responsibility for his actions. Sort of a dark Peter Pan. Very readable and enjoyable, as well as humorous throughout."
4,Wonder Boys,"Very well written in the style of Chabon, interesting characters and a concise and not abrupt resolution. I don't personally speak Pittsburgh, but I was able to follow what was going on even though I am not familiar with the various landmarks and streets that Chabon describes. A very quick read and I found it very satisfying with the characters easy to imagine."
1,"a wordy, uninteresting ""WordFest""","Someone has to balance the surfeit of obsequious praise lavished on this pretentiously written book, so I'm obliging. Chabon even uses words that are not in the dictionary, e.g., deinotherian. I realized halfway through the novel that I cared not a whit for any of the dissolute characters or what happened to them. I originally thought I would read the book then rent the film to see the characters rendered alive. To endure their various travails once more is too much for moi."
1,Awful!,This book was chosen for our book club. Everybody was disappointed. Saying it was awful is one of the kinder opinions from our club members...
4,Marilyn Monroe's Wedding Jacket,"Grady Tripp is this total stoner professor ,whose life a complete mess. His long suffering wife left him, his girlfriend,who is his boss's wife is preggers and it's his and he has this 2000 plus page novel that he has been working on for 7 years that makes no sense.The supporting cast includes this total fool of an flamboyant agent who is dating a transexual, and is best friends with a very gifted young writer who is a somewhat of a tortured genius and is obsessed with Marilyn Monroe.Despite the coarse language , it was a great book.Much better than Cavalier and Clay .. that one exhausted me completely and was about 250 pages too long..Don't see the movie, the movie is beyond terrible.. Why Phillup S. Hoffman wasn't given the role of Grady Tripp I dunno."
5,beauty unsurpassed,"this is a nearly perfect, hilarious, realistic look at life and it makes one heck of a good read!"
4,Great Writing About Writing,"Michael Chabon's amusing and insightful novel Wonderboys concerns an aging novelist, Grady Tripp (also the narrator), whose life and 2,600 page novel are quickly spinning onward without him. Other important characters include Grady's long-time agent, Terry Crabtree, and Grady's most gifted and troubled student, James Leer. The novel is divided into parts, of varying length, that move fluidly between present actions, the past, and what it means to be a writer. It is funny, sad, and bizarre in so many ways, but it does seem to capture some of the ethos of writing and reading literature."
4,My first Chabon experience....,"...and I was very pleased. Good story, great characters, fine writing."
5,Read this book!,"Michael Chabon is my favorite author, and this book ties Mysteries of Pittsburgh as my all-time favorite. Its a complicated story of human emotions -- you will laugh, cry and the vivid descriptions are amazing."
1,wierd but not very humorous,I thought the book was sad and disjointed. I really don't understand the ratings for this book.Maybe better if you are not sober!
4,CHABON IS TALENTED...,"""Find out what each character cares most about in the world because then you will have discovered what's at stake."" (Anne Lamott) Wonder Boys exemplifies this recomendation. Michael Chabon makes fiction look easy. Wonder Boys is a well crafted exhilarating read. Enjoy."
5,oh boy,"As I am sure many of you know of the film that is due to come out soon, and therefore may be resistant to reading this book (many book snobs fear being seen as trendy,) but do yourself a favor and read it anyway. It is good. It should not be missed.Tell you what, let's make a bet: if you're not laughing by page 25 of ""Wonder Boys,"" then I will come to yout house and cook you dinner. (See amazon.com disclaimer for additional details.)"
2,Not Good,"I read a bit of this, then skimmed the rest. I could pick out the plot points like they were flags on a golf course. Literary fiction is supposed to be pure, with no tricks. Well, this had plotting as awkward as the worst John Grisham novel. And its pretentious use of language made me cringe at times. If Chabon is the best literary writer under 40 (as some say he is), then MTV really has destroyed some minds."
4,Michael Chabon is a rising star.,"When his first book of short stories came out, his writing drew comparisons to Salinger, but after this, his third work, I don't know how accurate that is. He has developed a style all his own, combining humor and energy with just plain good fiction. Not as funny as _The Mysteries of Pittsburgh_, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing as this work is definitely worth reading. I think that Michael Chabon and Nick Hornby have a lot in common, and the two of them are the authors I watch the papers for in anticipation of new releases. The characters in their stories are seperated as the Americans and the British look at life in slightly different ways, but both imbue their characters with such charisma and humor that you cheer them on no matter how stupid they may be acting."
4,Wonder Boys: A Novel,"Fun to read but complex as all the threads of the plot come together. A very enjoyable book. I'm reading ""The Yiddish Policemen's Union"" now and I'm impressed by Chabon's originality and skill. I love it when books are so good that I crave uninterrupted time for reading."
4,a delightful story about misery,"I was assigned this novel by my writing class & would not have read it if it wasn't an assignment. Chabon is a definite poet. His strong command of the English language & his wonderful turns of phrase made this one of the most enjoyable novels I've read in a long time. It's no ""Wonder"" his novel became a movie."
4,A thoroughly enjoyable read.,"The characters are quirky, but completely believable and their adventure together is both hilarious and poignant. Michael Chabon is a wickedly inventive author. I look forward to seeing whether Curtis Hanson (director of LA Confidential) can bring the same glorious life to Chabon's writing that he did to James Ellroy's as this is the source material for Hanson's next film (due in the theaters in late 99)."
5,Fantastic Reading,"This is writing at its best, the way that writing should be. Chabon's novel is completely engaging from the first page until the last. Anyone who enjoys reading well written literature will love this book. I will read anything and everything this man writes."
4,Not too bad...,"Okay, I'll admit it. I hated this book the first time I read it. Then I re-read it, and it's grew on me. Now, at my third time through, I'm in love. It's wonderful to read a book about my hometown and be able to relate to it."
4,Great looking hat.,"The hat is very nice looking! Can't wait to wear it on vacation!The sizing runs a little small. I ordered a small but received a large. After trying on the large, I realized I needed a medium."
3,ok but a little too pricey for what you get,"I wasn't impressed with the quality of this hat, but I didn't feel completely ripped off. I guess you could say it's water proof if you're in a light misting rain. Overall, this is an okay hat, but the price should be around $15-20."
3,Well made product but prefer leather over canvas,"If your looking for a well made canvas hat then this is the hat for you. Having owned a few Barmah hat's, I thought I'd like a canvas hat over the leather Cooler hat but, I ended up returning this hat and buying the leather one. The Leather one is easier to pack (I am going to be doing a lot of traveling in the coming year) and I don't have to worry about messing up the wire brim in the canvas hat. I also prefer the feel of the leather and the flexability that it gives more so then canvas. I gave it a 3 out of 5 because of the really good quality of Barmah hat's but, I could not give it a 5 out of 5 because of my own preferences."
4,Jouney of an excellent trio,"What makes this album unique amongst Rabih Abou Khalil CDs is that this CD features a trio. Rabih's specialty is his ability to weave many instrumental parts into a beautiful Middle Eastern song. On most of Rabih's albums there are a fair 7-8 musicians and often Rabih's oud playing is not the focus. Here with just three musicians, Rabih's oud playing and improvisational skills take the forefront. I would not recommend this as someone's first Khalil CD, as your first experience of this master should be one where he uses his masterful arrangement skills (Blue Camel, Arabian Waltz, Sultan's Picnic). However, once you have acquired those CDs you will find another side of Rabih here. This album features some of the tightest improvisation of any Rabih CDs. The pianist, Kuhn, is masterful and pushes Rabih in new directions. As with all Rabih CDs there is masterful frame drum play to tie it all together."
3,I liked It But Could I Live It?,"I thought this book had some great advice and concepts.This Book Contained valuable information on:* Food Preservation* Attending Wounds* Building Shelter* Creating Simplistic But Efficient Weapons* Acquiring Water* Must Have Items For Building A Proper First Aid KitThese are all great things to know especially any survival situation, CHTF for otherwise. However, a bulk of the book was centered around Nuclear explosions and how to survive them. Apart from that, the lessons learned here are more for those who can currently prepare a place off the grid (so to speak) with the hope of not being discovered or blown away. Am I thankful I bought this book? Absolutely! It's far better than the information I had retained in my head. However, if I had the chance to do it over again I would read my review and find something a bit more accurate to my life style and the type of situation I am most likely to find myself fighting to survive in."
1,Stupid,"This book is stupid. For a survival book, it is high on talk and light on useful fact. There is an entire section with sketches of various Soviet rockets, missiles, aircraft, and submarines. Even during the cold war, when this book was first published, how is my survival affected by the sketch showing the difference between the Minuteman II and Minuteman III missile? The whole book is filled with this useless nonsense. Don't both with it. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere."
1,"If negative stars were possible, that's what Scott should get","DO NOT BUY ANY SCOTTS PRODUCTS. They ignored their own scientists and put seeds treated with toxic pesticides in their ""Morning Song"" and ""Country Pride"" products. That kept insects from eating the bird feed, but it has also killed millions of birds.You don't really need to feed birds to help them through the winter. People who bought Scott's products thinking they were helping our dwindling stocks of songbirds have unknowingly made this situation even worse.Scott hasn't said anything about this on their website. If you want to call them to let them know how you feel about them as a responsible company, have at it: 1-888-270-3714.By the way, don't use any Scott or other lawn care product that contains the herbicide 2,4-D. It causes cancer in dogs, kills aquatic organisms exposed to lawn runoff, and probably isn't so great for your children, either. Try pulling your dandelions instead of poisoning your children and pets."
5,Just Great!,"I've been long waiting to hear anything, absolutely anything from these two monsters and then these CD set came along...it's wonderful! These guys are truly a magic duo! Bobby's voice hasn't changed a bit, Richie's piano playing is as furious and genius as ever, the percussion arrangments and execution are marvelous, and the wind section, even though it doesn't sound as crystal clear as it used to sound is still impresive. I didn't like their using a drum set, I'd love to hear Richie playing an acoustic piano again not a Roland or a Rhodes or a Korg. Other than that, this is a great, great CD. If you like real Salsa (not the kind being done nowadays that sucks big time), if you enjoy geniality and talent you cannot miss it, it sure is a gift to one's hears."
2,Wheel fell off,"I had to return this case. One of the wheels fell off after only one day of use and the other would not turn. I found I could screw the wheel back on and I added silone spray to the other, but this should not happen on a new, expensive case.When the handle is in the open position, there is a large gap around it so that in a heavy rain, your stuff will get wet. The two vertical pockets on the front are very difficult to use. Rather than two vertical, what is needed is one horizontal as a ""drop pocket"" to use before going through airport security. The external side pockets are too narrow to hold a phone or anything else.The photo and description are misleading. They refer to wide, rubber wheels, but instead mine came with standard hard in-line skate wheels. Moreover, the mesh external side pockets were missing on mine.In other respects the case is fine and allows for a lot of storage, but the defects are too serious to overlook."
3,good for very early intro to geography,"I use this book as a very early review for my 2-3 graders, to introduce them to the cocept of geography, and give them an overview of the world. I do feel, a regular atlas will accomplish the same though, and that would be something you can refer to over a longer time."
5,Excellent Resource for Libraries,"Wish some one could update this valuable handy book.The knowledge of evaluating electronic resources, though advanced since the year this book was published, it still has many basics.Librarians, information specialists, and other information content evaluators can surely benefit from this book."
1,Clumsy copy,"This was a grave disappointment! The ""painting"" I received was a poor imitation of the Van Gogh. It may have had some of the same colors and subject, but the balance, proportion and artistry were all out of whack. The only thing that was true to the original was the smell of the paint. I want a refund."
4,Straight From Wideman's Heart,"These are books that are difficult, emotional, and come from Wideman's heart. Many of the characters are real people in Wideman's family, and although the books are fiction, the action and dialogue seems real, which is part of his goal. Any book can be read first, but the order that seems most appropriate relating to the events is ""Damballah,"" ""Sent for You Yesterday,"" and ""Hiding Place."" Characters such as Mother Bess, John French, and Brother Tate become memorable instantly as they struggle to survive in a community (Homewood) that is dying each year. Sometimes parts of these books are hard to follow since there are no quotation marks for dialogue, but once familiar with this style, reading becomes easier. The best book in my opinion is ""Sent for You Yesterday"" because of its complex themes and characters, such as the voiceless albino Brother Tate. I highly recommend the trilogy to all readers who want reading that challenges your mind and values."
4,Finally...,"I have wanted a glass ""friend"" for years so when I saw this and the price I finally fulfilled my wish. It is a beautiful piece, especially in the sunlight."
4,Ladies what are you waiting for?!,"If you don't have one of these already, then make this your next purchase. It is a must have in any woman's collection. ;-) I wish I had gotten one years ago!"
5,The best whole wheat pasta I've ever had,"I've tried several whole wheat spaghetti pastas, and this is by far the best. I decided to try it because it was USDA organic, which is a big plus. In my experience, it is more difficult to get that perfect 'al dente' texture from whole wheat pasta. However, this product has cooked perfectly every time. The 12 individual bags are easier to store, too."
3,No Comment,This book was OK but the subject matter is personal therefore no in depth review. It was howerver a little helpful.
5,Should be made compulsory reading for every couple,"What a book! If you want to to truly please your partner, and have fun in the process, read it. Paul Joannides is living testimony to the fact that the only sin is not loving well."
5,hockey role model,"I read this book after my 13 year hockey player finished. This is a life lesson book. She is one of the top in her field and like C.Gunn had things to overcome that made them stronger. This book lets girls know these are real people that worked hard, and it is possible to shoot for the stars."
4,GREAT,"very convenient, my power goes out for like a week every year in the winter so this helps a lot since i can sit it upright like a lantern. the multiple ways to charge is very convenient too (solar, crank, plugin, battery). the only things i can think of that it needs are a cell phone charger & built-in weather radio. i took it to the drive-in movie so i could sit in the back of the truck & listen to the movie on it, its been very convenient & helpful."
2,Simply not flat,"Silly me, I thought I could purchase a couple of these (afterall, look at the price compared so say, Leecraft) and get a zero clearance for dado, regular and bevel cuts. I didn't get to do this right away but when I did decide to utilize the inserts, the first thing I noticed is that after placing them within the throat, there was a 'hump' (i.e., the inserts were slightly convex) in the middle of ALL THREE. Needless to say I was not a happy camper. I wanted/expected these things to be FLAT. So, just recently I purchased a Leecraft for my Ridgid 3650. Now this puppy is FLAT. I know, I know, look at the price difference. But then, look at the final product!"
2,works well,"Although this product worked on my Ridgid table saw, I found the pin that holds down one end was small, making it ""wobble"" somwhat. Also, the set screws really needed to be longer because I had to extend them almost completely into the insert to make it level with the working surface."
2,You get what you pay for,"This ZCI is basically cheap plastic. It flexes under load and fits loose in the table. Also, there is no groove in the underside to allow the 10"" blade to be used initially. It is useable but not desirable. For a top quality ZCI, get the Leecraft"
5,Excellent Product - Especially for the Price,"I bought two of these inserts for my Ridgid TS2400LS table saw - one for a thin kerf saw blade and the other to be used as a zero clearance dado insert for an 8"" stacked dado set. I was taking a chance since the one and only review I had seen here was negative. My gamble paid off handsomely. This insert fits my saw perfectly and making the slots for the aforementioned blade and dado set went flawlessly. And at half the price of what Ridgid was asking, I couldn't be happier."
4,Zero Clearance Insert Ridgid TS2400 series saws,"There was no problem dealing with Peach Tree or Amazon.Items arrived in a timely manner. The inserts seem to made out of marine lumber, Starboard. These inserts are made for a 8"" dado blade. The insert is 3/16"" thick around the edges and 3/8"" thick in the middle. The insert will not fit in place with a 10"" blade attached to the arbor. You have to turn the saw on and slowly lower the insert into the spinning blade. Not a good practice. For the price they are a good product and I would order more to use with various width dado's. You may want to look at Lee Craft inserts."
1,Warning: this product does not come with tips pictured,"This product does not come with tip M15, despite what the picture implies."
1,one tip was missing,one tip was missing from the package.... of course it was the one that I needed. Threw the other two away in disgust. Would have cost more to send it back than I paid for it in the first place. I should throw he phone away too. Motorola needs to stick to just ONE CONNECTOR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Idiots. I won't ever buy another Motorola anything.
1,Incomplete product,"Don't buy this product if you need the M15/16 mini-USB smarttip. That part was missing from the package the first time, so I followed up with customer service, who promised to have them check at the factory before sending it the second time - and when the second package came, it also was missing the part. I ended up returning both and buying the product from the manufacturer."
3,Problem solving outdated,"These books have helped me understand what my children have been going through at various stages/ages of their development. This book was on target with my daughter's behavior/temperment. However, I found the problem solving answers to be extrememely outdated. The authors suggested that a particular seven yr old who disliked school could either change to a private school, stay back in first grade or shorten the school day. What were they thinking? No suggestions were given as to how to talk to the child or work with the teachers,school or family doctor. I thought I would get some advice for a similar problem, not this time. In general I found this book helpful but think it needs to be updated, possibly each decade."
3,So-so,"While the information in this book is interesting, the language, examples and photos are very outdated. I wish I had looked more carefully at the copyright date."
2,Too general,"Was looking for more specifics on what they should and shouldn't be doing at this age so I can see where mine are fine and where they need to catch up. Language is very flowerly and very general, with not a lot of substance or specifics. Just my view."
5,Great book if you own a smoker,"While I do not have a Cookshack smoker (have a Brinkman), the recipes in this book are wonderful. Love the salmon ones."
3,Thought it would would have been better,"It's an OK book, but will SOMEONE please write a cook book where I can go to ANY STORE and purchase the INGREDIENTS easily? These whacko things like "" 1 cup powdered dextrose"" , 3 tablespoons of PRAGUE POWDER #1, OR 3 Tablespoons COOKSHACK RIB AND SPICY CHICKEN RUB, 1 cup Tortuga Citrus Honey??? are examples from 3 of their recipes for Ribs. Come one people. Most of the book's recipes are OK.....but I was looking for Rib recipes and when I started reading about these strange ingredients, I got disgusted."
2,Not Great.,"There is not much in here you can't get for free on the internet. What I really object to though is that there are recipes that effectively say ""buy our rub and put it on the meat"". Not what I was hoping for."
5,Still a good product.,No need to go into a long drawn out review over a product like this. It kinds speaks for itself.My father used to use the Xcelite line of products while working at his TV/radio repair shop back in the 50s and the quality is still there.I got this cutter and the flush cut version for doing electronic and model RR hobby work. Very well made and are still stamped with USA!
5,Great Lttle Helper,"Xcelite has always had a good reputation, and these little nippers are proof that this is still true. They are great for delicate and/or tight fit applications."
3,Good Introduction,This is a good introduction to Cafe. I would have liked more detailed treatment on Beans.
4,Classic Heavy Metal Sound,"Talk about a flash back, this sounds like some 80s thrash metal. Its worth its money, not one song is a let down. Awaiting the next release by these guys."
5,Metal music the way should be,"No doubt this is one of the best release of 1999 in the realm of metal, all te members were talented player which will never wear baggy stuffs. If you like metal music heavy and fast, get this album immediately or you will regret. Get the Witchburner EP and the latest offering - ""Dead, Hot and Ready"" by these metal maniacs."
4,For Toyota,"There is no doubt about how powerful Phil Collins music can really be. It is just amazing to see an artist who has been in the business for three decades keep coming back and still making a great appeal to the music industry. With Can't Stop Loving You, a song written by Leo Sayer, Phil recorded the cover, but it gained actual notarity by promoting it within the use by Toyota. The song was used within the company to endorse the Avalon automobiles. It worked for Phil, and Toyota. Can't Stop Loving You hit the Top 10 on the Adult Contemporary charts, and has been there for almost a year now. Hopefully, Phil will make it happen again."
5,Great book,"Great book i have read other books on Dr Murphy, but this one is revised and it still contains the same potentce of contents on how the subconcious can bring us riches. Just have to apply the exercises in the book and believe me through my own experience it will change your life! """
2,NOT WORTH IT,"He repeats himself and even though the idea is good, the influence of the mind on our lives is an interesting point, there are too many references to god and the bible.Was much more interesting ""the power of your subconcious mind"" of wich this is just a repetition."
4,So does Scarecrow really have two heads in the movie,"I noticed by pressing its arm down he has two different heads. One has glow up eyes, and the other is just normal. I didn't like this very much. I also think they could of gave him a hat. Overall this figure is allright."
5,Probably my favorite Yes album discovered after 1977,"I'm a big fan of the Yes albums up to ""Going for the One"". Just recently discovered ""Magnification"". This album is excellent from start to finish. It sounds exquisite via my vintage tube integrated and Beyerdymanic headphones."
2,Huge Disappointment!!!!!.......Hot Steaming Pile Of Crap!!!,I cannot beleive the reviews for this cd are what they are. I burned a copy of this cd from a friend but also put 2 other songs on the disc right after the end of Magnification....Siberian Khatru and America(any true Yes fan knows these songs). These 2 songs blow this whole cd out of the water. This cd is a bore. Where is the guitar?????? Did Steve Howe lose half of his fingers. Yes has always been a proggressive ROCK band but now they have regressed. Don't waste your money unless you are an insomniac.........this will definitely put you to sleep!!!!!!!
5,Pleasantly surprised.,"I just picked this one up the other night and was going to do a quick run through the tunes, well I ended up playing the disc three times (my 4.99 copy is just the first disc). Well worth the money if you're a Yes fan. The only negative is there's no Wakeman or Kaye, but with those parts being well executed by the orchestra, it really becomes a plus instead of a drawback. Still, if you're hoping to hear some dynamic keyboard parts, you may be disappointed. Overall this is musically their best recent disc (tie with The Ladder). Jon Anderson's singing is quite good here too."
3,Consider narrow necked Dr. Brown bottles instead,"I purchased the wide mouthed bottles for my twins. Could not figure out why the formula kept leaking out of the side of their mouths. One of my daughters lost at least 1/3 of her bottle each time. Very frustrating and very messy. This did not happen at all when I switched to the narrow necked Dr. Brown's bottle.HELPFUL HINT for all Dr. Brown bottles: When pulling nipple thru the collar, everytime run your finger around the base of the nipple inside the plastic collar to make sure it is fully seated before screwing nipple and collar on to the bottle. Eliminates leaks completely. And do NOT over-tighten collar onto bottle. Again, will prevent leaks. We learned all of these tricks the hard way! :)Mother of twin girls from Texas"
2,...They also leak!,"I bought these bottles for my son who had really bad spitting at birth..., and while it did help with the problem, the Browns Bottles leak! It is so fustrating to be feeding him and have the burp rap underneath him soaked! Unless, I'm not doing something correctly in the assembly which by the way is very time consuming when my little one is crying because he's hungry. ...I'd rather try a leak proof bottle over the Browns Bottle's for a clean and wet FREE feeding!"
1,Leaked everywhere!,These bottles make a complete mess! They leaked all over my bottle warmer and all over the baby. The cheap supermarket bottles worked better! I threw the Dr. Brown bottles right in the trash.
3,"OK bottles, we prefer Avent.",When my son was born I bought several different bottles. I was nursing him so the shape of the niple was important. Dr Brown bottles help with swalowing less air but it also made it harder to burp. Bottom line is my son did not like these bottles - he (now 12 mths) still likes Avent bottles and cups the most.
5,Love these!,"My baby had major problems with spit up and projectile vomiting. So much so that he ended up in the hospital dehydrated. The pediatricians thought it was food allergies or something more serious. They kept feeding him with a regular bottle. We switched him to Dr. Brown's and no more vomiting! Just normal baby spitup, which is not bad at all! They do leak, if you overfill them or if you let the plastic funnel thing fill up with formula or breast milk. If you loosen the cap, the air will come out of the bottle, making the formula go out of the funnel. No more leaks!"
2,large nipple base and flow overwhelmed my newborn,I received the wide neck and regular Dr. Brown's bottles as shower gifts. My son loved the regular bottles from day 1 - no problem. However when we tried the wide neck he dribbled a lot of formula and choked more often. Both used Level 1 nipples so have to assume it was the larger nipple area. I went back to the regular slim Dr. Brown's bottles and all has been fine. If your child is not an aggressive eater suggest you stay away from the wide neck bottles.
3,Too many parts and Leaky,"The bottles have many parts which make cleaning and assembling hard when you have a hungry baby. The bottle leak occassionaly, which upsets me. Besides those two down falls they are great bottles and they do make a happy gas free baby. My advise to you is when your child is done with the bottle rinse out and then leave the two small parts in warm soapy water and of course use your tool (which comes with the bottles) to clean out the vents in the air blocker (the small green circular object), so its ready for the next feeding."
5,Best bottles ever!,"No spit ups, no gas, no bubbles in the bottle. My 10 week old son doesn't spit after drinking from these bottles. The wide neck bottles, in my opinion, reduces the nipple confusion, since the nipple is soft and wide as the [...]. These are working great for me. I don't mind cleaning the few extra parts, its not a big deal at all.Update after a year: Still using the Dr.Brown bottles (the bigger size). No problems what so ever!!! Still love them."
2,Baby couldn't handle it!,Have been using Dr. Brown regular bottles - moved to wide neck based on reviews and the fact that I am breastfeeding and that this is supposed to be more like the breast. With 9 week old milk just comes dribbling out the side and more ends up on his chin and clothes than in his stomach. I'm not sure why this is happening and have tried on a few occasions to try again with the bottle. The regular Dr. Brown's bottle are working much better for us.
3,Anything self help has to have the magic number twelve in it somewhere,"Twelve....twelve....its like a mantra. I'm still waiting for numerologist Calypso Louis Farakahn's contribution to the field.Other than the tiresome extension of stretching some ""keys"" to fit the Procrustean bed of twelve, the healthy living goals outlined here actually have some pretty ancient philosophical and spiritual roots, sometimes mapping with Ignatian exercises and other ancient Catholic spiritual disciplines. So of those smarmy self-help books that are churned out with such regularity, this one isn't bad and is actually classicism updated with a fresh voice.For those who'd like to start with some easy ways for whole, healthy living, here are three: go to Mass every day, go to Confession once a week, and keep the Church's feasts and fasts. You'd be surprised how rich your life will become by following the Church calendar. The false gods in your life will fall away."
5,excellent,"I love the D-Ribose powder, am taking it per recommendation from my pain management doctor related to my chronic fatigue and feel that it has helped me gain back more energy as the product suggests it is for."
1,Horrible Product,"The last order of this product made me sick. When I opened it - it smelled like formaldehyde but I thought well maybe its something else but I took my usual dose on different days and noticed I didn't feel well but I thought it could be from something else. So about the third time I took it, I became sick and threw up - it was awful - my stomach was irritated for a few days afterwards. It could have been a bad batch because I've ordered this product before and my previous orders did not smell like formaldehyde."
2,Doesn't work as well as Corvalen,"D-ribose really helps with my energy levels! I started taking D-Ribose with the Corvalen brand which is great, but very expensive. So, I've tried two other brands now (Vitamin Shoppe and Now) and my energy level fell a little on both of the other brands. So, even though this is a good price, I notice more of a positive difference with my Corvalen."
3,D-Ribose For Energy,"I loved the D-Ribose for the first 3 days. Energy levels were up, anxiety was down. After 3 days I felt like I was awake physically but mentally asleep??? Not sure what to think about this as it is supposed to be a very good supplement?"
4,great energy for exercise,i use this product for bodybuilding and it helps me alot i used it for two weeks and then i tried working out without it and i really noticed the difference this product is great for that extra boost
2,Thought it would be comparable to Corvalen for CFS...,"I have been using Corvalen to treat chronic fatigue syndrome. I thought switching to this brand would save me some money. Unfortunately, the quality is not the same. It has an odd smell and tastes funny, but those things are negligible compared to it's effect on me. Several days after making the switch to NOW brand D-ribose my fatigue returned with a vengeance. I thought my returning fatigue was unrelated to my switch and persisted in my tiredness for 2 weeks, then on a whim I tried the Corvalen again. Within 2 days my energy began to perk up, and I felt alive again.Now I am not discounting the possible advantages of this brand for general use, but I would not recommend it as a supplement to treat Chronic Fatigue."
4,Great taste!,I can tell a little difference with this product. It is almost so tasty you want to eat it as a dessert! I like that.
3,Not sold yet,"Have only been using this product for a few weeks (on recommendation of Dr. Oz's show). Haven't really seen any improvement in ""energy"" level so the jury is still out."
3,D-Ribose powder,"This product dissolves easily , has a nice taste (not overly sweet) I cann't see the effect yet. I will give it another couple of weeks."
1,does nothing. scam scam scam,I used this product for more than a month. It did NOTHING. The reviews are all BS and this does not work. Save your money.
3,D-Ribose Powder - Anygood?,"I have been taking this product for only 7 days, so I cannotsay if it really works; I seem to feel an improvement though."
1,Very Disappointed,"D-Ribose is supposed to help with energy. After 2 bottles, I felt the same.No new energy, infact, I didn't feel any difference at all. Very disappointed.I'm not sure I will listen to Dr. Oz anymore. I learned about D-Ribose fromhis show."
1,Not as effective as adverised,"I read all the reviews and bought the product. For me is it's a waste of money. I workout 5 days a week and in my workouts my fatigue level dropped after a week of using the product as directed. I'm disappointed! Just like a lot of other supplements, all it does is make for expensive urine."
1,Fibromyalgia,I have not noticed any difference in my pain or energy level using this product for fibromyalgia. I would not use this product again.
2,OK,This product does not seem to be as good as Life Extension or Bioenergy which are both more expensive. I thought I give this product a try will not buy again.
2,What does product really do for you?,"I like product as a substitute for sugar, however, I did not really achieve any physical difference in energy so I am not sure why I would continue using."
2,Not effective,"Decided to try this product to help with chronic muscle/nerve pain to see if I would see any benefit. Had read some articles and reviews online that stated this product would help with chronic pain. It didn't. Might work great for what it was intended for....post exercise, I think. Didn't notice any decrease in the degree of pain or tender spots. Oh well. Wasn't unpleasant to take...had a sweet taste to it."
4,Billy J Kramer and the Dakotas.,"This had to be one of if not the most underrated group in the British Invasion. The Dave Clark Five wasn't underrated, they were under-avaliable, since until a few years ago, Dave Clark wouldn't let them be sold here. Billy J Kramer and the Dakotas should have been bigger over here, but perhaps that's because so many record promoters act like...""Little Children""."
3,"It's okay, but there's not much to it.","This is a story about three mice who ask their grandfather to bring them to the dark of the stairs, where they meet a cat and are scared out of their wits.It's not a bad story, it's just not a great one. Given that the book is oversized (read: hard to shelve), you may be better off just skipping this one."
4,Parent Review,I was not sure if this was too scary when my thre year old son picked this book out. When we got home we read it over and over again. It kept him in suspense trying to figure out what was at the top. I suggest this cute book for any 2 to 3 year old and my son would too. We had to go buy the book.
4,Parent/Child review,My son picked this book off a cart at the library and I was hesitant to read it with fear that it may scare him. He loved it as it kept him wondering what was at the top. We had to read it over and over each night. He likes cats and loved the book. I eventually had to buy the book. I recommend this for any 2 1/2 to 3 year old. It is a cute story!
4,Rancher's Blood,"""Rancher's Blood"" is the third Jefferson Birch Western written by W.W. Lee, who is better known as mystery novelist Wendi Lee. Birch, who works for Tisdale Investigations, is hired to find and deliver Clem Johnston, who is accused of killing Frank Ashton, a wealthy rancher in Carson City, Nevada. Johnston was found standing over Ashton's body with a bloody knife in his hands. Birch finds Johnston quickly. Birch and his boss Arthur Tisdale (who goes along to see how Birch operates) begin the journey to Carson City. They lose Johnston when his sister Emma helps him escape. Birch does not believe Johnston killed Ashton, and sets out to prove it. This novel is a Western with a mystery as are the other Jefferson Birch novels. The thing I enjoy about Lee's Westerns is that she puts the reader back in the Old West, something not all Western writers accomplish. I really enjoyed this novel, and look forward to reading the other 3 in the series."
3,Not bad for adults!,This book is a collection of essays about the Brown decision. It is not the story of Linda Brown that I was hoping for. Current juvinile authors tell of their own experiences during that period. It's interesting.
4,A Real-life Guide to Marriage,"Dr. Herron has written an excellent book. In Bridges to Intimacy, Bob has created a wealth of material that is based in real-life experiences. A man of deep faith (this shows through in his writing) he reflects on the spiritual strengths needed to persevere in this day and age in a marriage. I often recommend this book to couples, both those who are in trouble and those simply desiring to enrich their relationships. It is easy to read, filled with wisdom and practical advice. You will not be sorry you purchase this book and I would venture to bet that you will end up recommending it to a friend, or even purchasing another copy for them."
2,Completely the wrong color,"The tie I was sent was nice, but it was completely the wrong color. It was BURNT ORANGE. It was very dark and looked nothing like the picture. Perhaps there was a mixup with mine, because the other reviewers seemed happy with theirs."
5,Highlander and His Lady,"A magnificent first novel by Lisa Samson! If you can find this book, I definitely recommend that you read it. The love between Jenny and Kyle is so real and the story itself is magical."
3,Great for reading to kids.,"BOBBY'S TROLL is a fun little collection of light stories. Nothing great here, but some gentle fun. The protagonists of the stories are children, and this would be a great book to give to young readers or to read to children too young to read. The stories are delightful. For those purposes, the book deserves four stars. Being a cranky old man myself, I found the stories pleasant bedtime reading, a story at a time.So, if you're a young parent, I recommend this book. The length of the stories makes it an easy read and you child will appreciate the humor and good nature of the stories."
5,Nice Honey,"- It has an alright taste. Reminds me of cough syrup in a very sweet and condensed form. (Keep in mind that honey made in different parts of the world tastes/looks different. This one is from Brazil & Canada)- Easily opened. A bit too easily though...the plastic covering where the cap screws off wasn't even any use. I twisted the cap and the plastic covering came off with it.- Big jar. Putting my entire hand around it, I can only reach halfway.- Can be messy since the honey is very sticky and can also be difficult to get a full spoonful onto a piece of bread without making a mess.- The ""expire date"" seems strange. I purchased this in mid-2012, and it says ""Best by 01/15"" even though natural honey shouldn't be able spoil. But I suppose it's required by U.S law. Maybe someone can clear this up?"
5,Raw Honey,I am very pleased with this product. The taste is really great; it is very easy to spread. I am planning to order more of it very soon.
5,Fantastic honey!,"This was the best honey I have EVER tasted. Also, because the flavor is so strong, I don't have to use as much of it. This in combination with the large jar size means I won't need to buy honey nearly as often anymore. I was a little hesitant to pay this much for honey, but then I went grocery shopping and at the cheapest non-walmart grocery store, it was nearly $4 for a tiny 4 oz. bottle of ultrafiltered, watered-down honey (which I really think shouldn't even count as honey). So, I bought this honey instead, depending on the extremely favorable reviews it had received in the past and I'm SO happy I did. I'm planning on buying more when this jar finally runs out."
5,delish!!,"this is possibly... no definitely, the absolute best tasting honey i have ever had. i have obviously never had real honey, bc this is unlike anything else i have had."
5,YS Organic Honey,"This is one great company and product. The package could not have been better. No chanceof breakage. A great job. The honey is at the upper limits of best taste,Quality,and purity.If you use honey frequently, I recommend this product."
5,Beeautiful,Great product from Vitacost. Loved it. Never had such incredible tasting honey in my life. Would recomend this product to all. The cost is low too. One could never get this volume for the cost at a store.Deb
5,YUMMY!,"This honey is SO GOOD! I'm not even kidding when I say that when I have a sweet tooth, I will literally take a spoon and eat a teaspoon of this and I'm satisfied. I use it in my tea, on my toast, bagels, this stuff rocks! I bought some for my Mom and she went nuts over it too. I tried Agave nectar and as it turns out, I'm allergic to it. I got itchy and dizzy and my heart felt like it was going to pound of of my chest! Stevia just left me with a bad aftertaste. YUCK! This honey is awesome, I highly recommend it!Great alternative to sugar."
5,DELICIOUS! :-p,"This honey taste great. I'm very satified with quality of this product, and It's priced less than most of the other bands on this site."
4,"What can I say, its raw",Wish there had been a more accurate way of determining when this was going to arrive... it froze in my mailbox before I could rescue it.... but such is the nature of my area...
3,CHECK THE PER OUNCE PRICE WITH YOUR CALCULATOR,I shop online pretty late at night after getting home from working a 12 hour shift at an airport. I looked at the price per ounce this vendor advertises and states a 32 oz jar of honey for $19.03 ( i think) breaks down to just .40 cents per ounce. FALSE! Calculate it out and it is actually .60 cents per ounce.. a $7.00 difference .. Shame on me for trusting that math calculation. IN the future I will check my prices with a calculator..
3,YS Organic Bee Farms Honey,"I had read many good comments about this honey, and even talked to people that use this honey. I was not as impressed as I thought I should have been. The local unprocessed honey I buy tastes better. Why can't we have good Raw Certified Organic Honey that is Ameircan Made. This product is from Canada and Brazil!!!!"
2,Price per ounce calculation is misleading and incorrect,I am not sure how the price per ounce calculation works but it seems to be incorrect (I am trying to find inexpensive honey). Currently it says .25 cents per oz. The product is 32 ounces. This should be an $8 product. Instead it is a $12+ product (not counting shipping). So that is closer to .38/ounce.
2,"Depressing, Not Much Happens","Man, I really wanted to like this book. I love historical fiction, espescially told from a woman's point of view. Especially when there is some mystical or magical aspects. This book starts out strong, and has a lot going for it. But from start to finish, the characters never progess. There is no rising action, no climax. It is just bleak and you pretty much dislike all of the characters by the end. I was just trying to get through the last 65 pages or so, absolutely no joy or real compulsion to finish except to get it done."
4,Hearty Viking Tale,This book is look into the past of Viking settlements in Grrenland and Iceland. The 3 main characters were well drawn and enjoyable. The book took a downturn towards the end as Christianity came on the scene. Most enjoyable for me were the parts on Viking spiritual ceremony and the Runes.
4,The Thrall's Tale,"Judith Lindbergh, The Thrall's Tale (Penguin 2007) depicts the Norse settlement in Greenland in the 10th century (the epoch of Eric the Red). The protagonists are a woman slave (or thrall) of Irish extraction (a crypto-Christian in the twilight of the traditional Norse gods), her daughter (the product of a brutal rape), and the elderly seeress who takes them both in. The writing is almost poetry. It not only puts the reader into that world; it puts you into their skins.I found it quite absorbing."
2,BORING!,"I must admit that this book started out good and I was really happy with it. The lady is a good enough writer and the plot seemed intriguing. But what the hell happened, I couldn't quite tell you. There was no real action, thus providing many places where the tale just seemed to stall and never pick up enough to keep me satisfied. I couldn't remember how many times I dozed off to this. One too many times to keep this book in my library from here on out. Its getting donated to Goodwill, where I hope some person will find it and hopefully enjoy it more than I did. I really wanted to like this one, but it just comes up short in a decent story."
1,not good at all,"I really thought the book was going to be great when I read the inside cover and duskjacket write up, but it is nothing of the kind.Someone on the back cover of the book compared it to Memoirs of a Geisha , that is laughable as it is not even comparable.I have no problems with the way the story is told, its the dialogue which is extremely hard to follow. It gets descriptive and perhaps too crazy? I don't know how to describe it. Characters shouting out or chanting? It was just too stupid to even follow. Just horrible dialogue and the storyline is not strong enough to make up for it.I eventually gave up and stopped reading the book. It gets worse as the story goes. Sometimes I even forget who was speaking in the story and I find my mind wandering around.Its a real shame , since it says the author spent 10 years researching the story and historical facts. Perhaps she should have worked on the dialogue.Dont' even bother."
4,An engrossing read,"This book is very hard to put down. Flows well...the transition between characters is easy, their voices flow together so nicely. I'm not done with it yet, that's why I only gave it 4 stars. Can't say for sure if I will like the ending...so many authors fail to bring the story together in the end. But, I've had a hard time putting this one down...give it a try if you like well researched historical fiction."
4,THe Thrall's Tale,"A very interesting book about Vikings settling Greenland, and the advent of Christianity there. It also really brings to life the opinion of the philospher Hobbes who said that life can be ""nasty, brutish and short"""
2,The Reviews are Misleading,"The prose of this book is raved about in the reviews...personally, I felt the writing was way more embellished than it needed to be. It reminded me of the movie Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves w/ Kevin Costner. In the movie, he tried to do the role with an English accent, but would have been better off just keeping his American one, as his attempt distracted, instead of added, to the movie. It is the same idea w/ the writing of this book. I felt the attempt to write the dialog as if it were the 10th century distracted from the story instead of added to it...and speaking of the story...Personally, I thought the characters were flat. I would have expected, for example, the rape of Katla to be an incredibly moving read. This just was not the case. I found myself skipping pages, in a sense, fast-forwarding to get to the end.I did want to reach the end, and that is why the book gets a C- in my grade book, and not a D. I still was intrigued enough to want to finish it."
1,trying to hard to be deep,"I can't define my disappointment. The blurb on the inside cover held so much promise. The setting, the plot, even the outline of the characters seemed to be exactly something I'd enjoy. Unfortunately, that blurb may have been the best part of the book. I finished the book with a bad taste in my mouth. Not one of the characters invoked any sympathy at all. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them. I couldn't like them or hate them. The plot was predictable and tired. But the absolute worst of it all was the complete indulgence of the prose. If the author could have gotten over herself and her inflated sense of prose, maybe she could have managed at least a decent story."
3,Depressing,"I wasn't very impressed by this book. The style was difficult to follow. It may have accurately depicted the life of the Vikings, but it was sad (and a little weird).In fact, the cruelty, the primitive dirty way they lived was really too much for me. I read half of it, and decided that it wasn't going anywhere I wanted to go. It put too many awful pictures in my mind, and it wasn't entertaining.It doesn't hurt though, to remind us that slavery is not a new invention, isolated to only the USA! It happened all over the world, for generations, with all civilizations (in this case - Scandanavians enslaving the Irish and Scottish)."
2,Please let this end,"The book started to pull me in to a very intriguing story of the lives of three women, Thorjeld who believes and studies the old Norse ways, Katla a Christian who does not follow Christ but has memories from her childhood, and the last Bibrau who is following the dark demon ways. Unfortunately the narrative is dry and you quickly lose interest in the people in the story. I got to a point where I just wanted to get to the end, which was such a disappointment. If everyone was as sad as the main characters of this novel, I would think that the Norse civilization would have just killed themselves from sheer depression!"
2,convoluted,"I didn't really care for this book, the plot was long and drawn out, and slow moving. When I read a book, I like to be able to sit down and get lost in it, and that just wasn't possible with this one."
5,Fantastic Source about a Fantastic Man.,"I have been a great fan of Franz Liszt for quite some time, and Alan Walker brought the composer to life in his trilogy of books about the famed musician.This volume goes into great detail about Liszt's life after he decided to end his life as a virtuoso, and become a composer. His love for Princess Carolyne became apparent in his music, and in his interactions with others.While it is not as descriptive as I would have liked regarding Liszt's symphonic poems, my favorites among his many works, i still felt that this volume is well worth every penny I spent on it. Definitely a worthy buy for anyone interested in music and what makes up a composer."
4,Attention all Lisztians,"If you are a Lisztomaniac, this is for you. It is a book that is very difficult to put down. Liszt's life reads better than a novel, and Walker's narrative flows superbly. He has investigated every biographical avenue and brings the Weimar of the 1800's to life.On the negative side: There are copious footnotes, which often stray off the subject, whilst others belong to the main text from which they divert. As the book is meant to be a work of scholarship, the amount of opinion and speculation which peppers the book is also rather annoying. One has to be very cautious in separating Walker's own views from the first-class academic research that he has done.Nonetheless as this book covers the most prolific period of the composer's life, you can do no better than read Walker's account to dicover just who Liszt was, his importance to musical history and the enigma of the man himself."
3,For College.,"The book was in good condition, but the front page was nearly ripped in half. But it's ok, the rest is perfectly fine! And it got here on time, which was great."
3,Not lacking in information,"This book is hard to read. It's not something that you would want to pick up and read outside of a history class because the information is so dense. It is pretty accurate and does give good info/facts but again it's very heavy and there is alot to get through. History majors might find this useful for dates, periods, and civilizations of the ancient Med."
5,excellent read in ancient history,"This is a great intro book on ancient civilizations around the mediterranean. While the subtitle is Egypt, Greece & Rome, the author goes into other, older and more distant cultures as well. The chapters are short and leisurely - you get a good feel for each section without being buried in details."
3,Tough to Follow,"This book is a required textbook for a college humanities class. While the book is definitely highly thorough, I found it difficult to follow. Perhaps this is due to the way it is organized, but I find that Freeman will begin discussing a certain topic, and then get off on rabbit-trails, which makes the read confusing. For instance, he will begin by describing a certain city or region as related to a specific battle or war, but then begin talking about the town's history, culture, art, etc, before circling around back to the topic at hand. For me, this makes it for a slow read, because I really have to stay focused in order to grasp everything he is trying to say. Just my opinion though."
5,For real life relationship challenges. Essential tools to equip us for living in today's culture.,"Whether you've been married 30 years or thinking about getting married in the future, this book gives a picture of the world we live in today (addressing technology, friendship, the workplace, etc.) and the challenges we all face culturally and on a individual heart level. Practical tools you can use now. The book addresses real deal stuff. Each chapter has application questions for discussion. Highly recommended.Also good:The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That LastsEvery Man's Battle: Winning the War on Sexual Temptation One Victory at a Time (The Every Man Series)Love & Respect: The Love She Most Desires; The Respect He Desperately NeedsFree Yourself to Love: The Liberating Power of Forgiveness (Faith Words)"
3,Earth Medicine Earth Food,"I rated this particular item with three stars. Not because it isn't valueable, but because at this time in my life I am searchign for particular answers and tyhis book, however valueable it is, didn't have the answers I was seeking. Yet, the book is well done and full of good info."
2,This is not a Brine Shrimp Hatchery,"It is the base for a hatchery and some instructions on how to construct a hatchery. What you see in the photo is not what you get. You get the small black base, the tubing, the shrimp mix and some instructions. The cylinder you see attached to the base is a two liter coke bottle you provide. In addition you'll need an air pump, lighting and some way of keeping the water at 80 degrees (if you want to follow the instructions).I'd read several articles on building a hatchery, but chose to buy this one instead because it appeared to have a solid plastic cylinder.On the plus side having the air hose running out of the base so that it can double as a siphon is nice. Still the base, while solid, rattles around a lot once you start pumping air into it.I have no opinion on the hatch mix yet except that much of it seems to end up on the sides of the bottle and it comes from China, so I am more than a little worried about what's actually in it."
4,Simple to use,If you are in need of first foods for new fish this hatchery can't be any easier to use. It is straight forward and have had no issues at all with it. I would buy again.
4,It's a good hatchery kit.,"I'm a cory breeder, I've been using 2 of these for close to 10 years. They do exactly what they are intended for, hatch baby brine shrimp. Add your own 1 or 2 liter plastic bottle, hookup the base to an air supply and follow the directions. It doesn't get much easier to feed live baby brine shrimp to your fish.If you ever need to replace the gasket between the base and the plastic bottle neck, a regular garden hose gasket works just fine.I would have given it a 5 star rating if the hose barb on the bottom of the base where the air hose attaches would make a 90 degree turn toward the notch in the base."
1,Dont Buy,"This was a COMPLETE failure,.. I tried it multiple times and followed the instructions precisely. I was dissapointed at first because it does not include an air-pump and mostly because the shrimp hatched and then died and rotted. I worked in the pet industry for 7 years and I know both fresh and saltwater environments. I know how to run a biological system and this FAILS. I was lazy and fooled,.. don't make the same mistake.Don't buy this product!"
4,How to Have a Green Thumb Without an Aching Back,"I thought Ruth Stout's book was not only delightful to read, but it was full of useful gardening advice too.Even though she wrote this in the 1950's, it is still relevant today and in fact even more important for a new generation of gardeners who might not be familiar with the mulching techniques she uses. Her humorous insight into the emotions of gardeners are still apropos. This little book was a thoroughly enjoyable read!"
5,Wonderful!,"A sensitive portrait of a more innocent time in America. Gertner creates an array of funny and lovable characters, seen through the eyes of young Hal Moffat. Heart-wrenching dialogue. Elegant prose. A deeply moving work of fiction."
5,Excellent Resource,This excellent book is a must for everyone who wants to communicate more effectively with everyone. The book begins by helping the reader understand the four personality types. Through this information the reader can better understand how to shape his/her message for maximum impact. It then explains the complexities of giving a presentation and finishing with lots of ideas and instruction on crafting your message.This is one book I know I will reach for often and recommend it to anyone who wants to present effectively.
3,Too small for cats,"The width of this cup is not wide enough for a cat to drink from. Cats do not like to drink or eat from a narrow dish (their whiskers act as a width gauge, and will get bent out of shape with this dish). Dogs with their long snouts will not have a problem with the size - small dogs with this particular cup.Amazon took a while in sending along the link to get a refund for this item. I returned item with delivery confirmation.. Company told me that they would issue refund when product was received. I had to follow up with USPS to see that the product HAD been received. If I hadn't have followed up I am not sure how long I would have waited. Shipping charge was EXCESSIVE for such a small package (less than 1/2 lb, cost over $6)."
2,"could have been bigger, outragious shipping cost","it seemed bigger when I looked at it on line before I ordered, a better description would have been helpfuland sved me more than double the cost of the item in shipping :("
1,Disappointed,I ordered two of these bowls for my new dog. They are WAY too tiny for most dogs. Would be great in a bigger size.
5,"A Wonderful, Inspiring Book!","When I last visited a local book store, I had in mind to pick up another book but I saw HEARTS by Gail Godwin and after glancing through it, I decided it was worth buying and reading. Not only is it worth it, but it is one of the best books I have read all year! It is wonderful and so inspiring! Trust me - get this book - read it and share with your loved one and your friends. I hope this books takes off in popularity in February - Valentine's Day. It deserves it!"
4,on the waning side of nirvana,"After the two best albums to grace progressive rock in the seventies, with 'Tales From Topographic Oceans', Yes once more creates magic, but not quite at the same level as 'Fragile' and 'Close to the Edge'.Gone from this album is Bill Bruford, the very best drummer to grace early Yes.John Anderson and the core group of Yes move their creative paterns on to epic proportions: Tales is truly a progressive rock masterwork.Two disks, containing four themed songs (really operas) are still excellent, even though Alan White's drumming just doesn't hold a candle to Bill Bruford's - not to dis Alan, he is a great drummer, just not quite in the same ballpark as Bill Bruford.All in all, this is the last decent album put out by the 70's version of Yes.Enjoy!"
5,Top shelf prog,"I have always been a little perplexed by the critics' panning of this wonderful work. I guess it's a little like telling Mozart he put in too many notes!If you're into prog at all, treat yourself to Tales (or Yes' Relayer). Yes simply operate in a league by themselves. The last few minutes of Ritual is some of the most challenging, and gorgeous, guitar work recorded."
3,I admit it...,"I am a very enthusiastic Yes fan, and I have never quite understood the hatred that most rock critics have had for the group (was popular music really never supposed to have strayed so much as one inch from Sam and Dave?) That said, you don't have to be a critic to think that this album went on just a *bit* too long. Granted, it has its moments--I love the acoustic ending of ""The Ancient,"" and ""The Revealing Science of God"" would have worked well as Side One of a typical Yes album, with shorter (for Yes!) tracks on Side Two. That said, is there anyone--even hard-core Yes fans--who can honestly claim that they habitually listen to all four sides at one sitting, the way that I do with every Rolling Stones, Beatles, or Traffic album I own (not to mention ""Fragile"" or ""Close to the Edge?"")"
4,Nostalgia wins out,"I saw Yes on their Tales from Topographic Oceans tour in San Diego a long time ago. It has always been one of my favorite albums, I still have a copy on vinyl. I can't say anything bad about it."
4,A long journey,"For the true Yes fan, this is almost a religious experience. It's lengthy, over-the-top and self-indulgent at times but still an enthralling journey from beginning to end. It goes from strange and noisy to beautiful and serene, then back again. I once spent a day riding through the Rocky Mountains with another Yes fanatic back in the 70s and we both had to keep our seat belts on to keep from ascending into heaven! If Yes is not your cup of tea, then stay away. Evidently they felt free enough at this point in their career to drop all pretense of delivering a top 40 hit and just went with their urge to create 4 side-long epics without restraint. Jon delivers his earthy sermons, Chris and Alan mesmerize with their rythms, Rick holds up the musical background like a scenery technician and, as always, Steve Howe's guitar work is simply amazing. For the Yes fan, this is an ocean of joy."
4,not as bad as you'd think,"i purchased this rhino remaster recently and the only major flaw was that you could not listen to the whole original version without changing cds. the sound is the most stunning feature as it was always muddy sounding even on the lp. Revealing Science and The Ritual are the best of the four originals. Rick Wakeman is the highlight of this set, his exquisite mellotron passages and non-bombastic moog (unlike ELP)are some of the best of the entire genre. i saw them perform in quadraphonic at the Boston Garden on this tour. they opened with the entire Close To The Edge album, then all four sides of Topographic, then encored with Roundabout. this record was trashed by critics when released and they were accused of going too far. maybe they did? still, not an easy listen for someone who is just getting into Yes. it is a milestone of prog rock."
3,Ambitious But Average Album,"This is an album from Yes that I neither love nor hate. I procured this album not too long ago, and can say that I listen to it hear and there. There's not one complete song that I like, just certain parts from certain songs. The third song's pretty boring and insipid. I like Rick Wakeman's keyboard playing on the beginning of the first song though, pretty moving. Maybe since I'm more of an '80s fan, that could be the reason for my lukewarm attitude toward this album, but I don't think so. An album that's ambitious, well played, but on the most part bland and too spread out."
1,"Oh, Please!","This album is best served by those who use ""eclectic"" regularly in their vocabulary. ""Close to the Edge"" it is not."
1,Doo-Doo,"Look up pretentious in the dictonary and you'll find this band.If you take these guys seriously there's no hope for you.Say ""no"" to Yes."
1,What a mess!!!,"Can you imagine what it would be like to have a set of good actors without a good director? Unfortunately we have a similar case here, good musicians who don't know what to do with their skills, they are creating noise not music. They start something and they don't know how to finish it, they need a composer!"
1,the most boring yes on cd.,"A huge let down from the quality of the yes album,fragile,close to the edge & yessongs.Don't waste your money or time on this one.The joke at the time of the album's release back in the 70's was that Yes finally went over the edge!"
4,"A MUST FOR THE ""REAL"" YES LISTENER!!!!!!!!1","This has to be the most ""classic"" storyline type albumsever created for this time period. The combination writingsof Anderson and Howe (which believe it or not,this album was written in 3 evenings at their hotel, where YES were staying at,on the road) plus Squire""s driving,syncopated bass lines.and Whiteis following Squire,or is it the other way around. On this2 disc set try to listen to the first song,then listento the last song. Dont just hear what is going on,but what isgoing on behind ""the music"". Sometimes,example on the 2nd song ,second disk,you will hear Howe play riffs that come from the past,someare from Fragile and Close to the Edge. When this firstcame out ,it was booed by the critics and downgraded bythe true YES listener. Buy this CD, give them anotherlisten,you will be quite surprised."
4,Definative Yes Album,"Tales certainly isn't the best Yes album the group ever released, but i would definately say that it is probably Yes at their most Yes-like. Track 1, the Revealing Science of God is a great song, and certainly ranks up with the best Yes epics. The Remembering is perhaps the one track i never really got into. The middle section of the song is great, and so is the ending, but this is one song Yes should have probably trimmed down a little. The Ancient seems to be the track most people dislike, though i quite like it. Howe's acoustic work is superb, and so is the whole 'leaves of green' section. Ritual is probably the second best song overall, and Howe's guitar solo at the end of this song is arguably the greatest guitar moment ever, in my opinion atleast, and is the perfect end to this album.Although certainly not for everyone, if you listened to and liked Close To The Edge and Relayer, you will no doubt like this record."
3,"OK, boys, now settle down...","The usual rap against this double album is the sense of massive, incomprehensible pretentiousness it conveys. Well, if you are a prog rock follower at all, you know to expect that from damn near every band that ever flew that particular banner. You can't slap this in the player and expect to snap your fingers and do the twist, you know what I'm saying?It's the *sound* of these compositions that has me on edge sometimes, grating my teeth. Steve Howe puts forth some truly *ugly* guitar solos, and Chris Squire's bass has a monophonic, hollow grumbling that sound like a Rickenbacker with a bad head cold.When those two elements aren't at their most overpowering, there's some wonderfully pleasant and introspective music to listen to. This is easily the most Eastern-influenced set Yes produced, which is not surprising since John and Steve started working on the compositions while touring in Japan."
4,Tales Is Yes At It's Best,"This 2 CD set allows you to hear the band not constrained by a 4 or 5 minute song. All the songs are long, and they weave in and out of the various sounds that made Yes so distinct.The Rhino recording is just OK, a bit too flat sounding to me, but it's been a few years since I've heard the original album. It could be the original was not audiophile quality either.A good set for real Yes fans - lots of memories here."
3,The Anti Velvet Underground,"Ok, so if your a literati type your just not gonna like this. This is music that caters to SONIC verbosity rather than lyrical acumen. Yes is the polar opposite to the Velvet Underground. If you don't dig instrumental music do NOT buy this. This is music that swings for the fences, and theres nothing wrong with that...once and a while."
3,Yes - The Ultimate Experiment,"I have been a Yes fan for over 25 years and I have to say that this is not my favorite work. I respect what they were trying to accomplish but they were too focused on the size, scale and scope of the ""project"" and not on creating what they are capable of.There are some memorable moments on this album (And I did enjoy hearing the ""Revealing Science of the Gods"" live on the 97 tour) but overall this album represents music burnt to a crisp."
2,Far below their best material,"As a longtime and diehard Yes fan, I can safely say that this album is a serious clunker. Another reviewer said this is a love or hate album. I would agree. I wouldn't say I hate it, but I definitely dislike most of it. The Ritual is pretty good, but the rest is just boring and directionless. I love long epic prog songs, but these songs just sound like they were made long just for the sake of being long. They just kind of meander along with no purpose or direction at all. It is a shame because the albums before and after it are all great. The Yes Album, Fragile and Close To The Edge are 3 of the greatest prog albums of all time and Relayer is pretty darn good too, but Tales From Topographic Oceans just falls way short of the mark."
1,A Strange Genesis Album,"Quite surprisingly, there was a mistake with the cover when I bought this record. Besides, why did the band replace Peter Gabriel with a clone of Jon Anderson? Apart from that, you can clearly recognize Steve Hackett's guitar play and Phil Collins' drumming. Mike Rutherford has a rawer sound that usual, but that's him with no doubt (basic but efficient bass lines) and Tony Banks is still the same great virtuoso, although his Minimoog sounds a little cheap. But why the hell do they only play one after another on this record? And why these hippy versions of Supper's Ready and Watcher Of The Skies? This album is supposed to be experimental, not only because of the tracks' running time - so why do I feel that it's been done before (and better)?OK, I think you got the point."
3,A Breath-taking Bunch of Arse,Fantastic. Awesome. Amazing. What a nerve! It's so crap it's good. No other band before or since has scaled the heights of rediculousness quite so spectacularly or quite so unsurpassably as Yes did on this opus. A truly memorable souvenir of the excesses of it's era.
5,"Sorry, Bill (correction; static in ""Ritual"")","I went back to the Gaswirt (1994 remmie) and that burst of static I spoke of below is there too! Now, the question is, ""When did it get there, or was it always there, and how did I miss it all these years?"" Maybe the remastering brought *out* an imperfection? Hmm... Anyone have the old CD, and thus the answer? Meanwhile, to the CAP reviewer below, is there anything so bad about fairies?"
3,Too Ambitious? It WAS The '70s!!,"Based largely on the Shastric Scriptures, composers Jon Anderson and Steve Howe created four twenty minute pieces incorporating many musical styles and influences. And although the songs contain some of the most clever and melodious of all Yes arrangements, there is a lot of padding here. Perhaps ""Topographic"" would have been better having its best moments distilled down to a single album. This album is often held up as an example of indulgent prog-rock excess. But darn it; I believe SOMEONE had to put out a creation like ""Topographic"". Because the 1970's was about pushing the boundaries of popular music, among other things. This album will test you, but your patience will be ultimately rewarded."
2,Primary goal: to make four album side length songs,"It's obvious that the only objective for this Yes album was to fulfill the conceit of making four album-side length songs. How those songs are composed, and whether they made cohesive pieces of music was secondary at best. I don't understand other reviewers take on this album as great progressive rock. It's NOTHING like Close to the Edge or Fragile in the way those albums could draw the listener in and involve him with great grooves and great musical pieces that gel together. The album cover is the best part."
2,"Some great moments, but I'm with Wakeman on this one","I had problems with this one thirty years ago, and I still do. Some great moments here and there, but lots of flashy, tuneless, pointless grandstanding as well, and as another reviewer has already pointed out, Jon Anderson was awfully full of himself back then.I still like 'Close to the Edge' a lot, though."
2,Too Much Filler,"Bill Bruford could see it coming...that's why he left right before this album.Rick Wakeman was fed up with this recording session to the point where he quit the band after this album.Even Chris Squire didn't think it was a good idea.All those should tell you something about this album...it was treading more in dangerous waters than topographic oceans. Rick Wakeman was right on the money when he said that this album contained mostly filler material...alot of parts were ""bled to death"" because they didn't have enough music to fill the album.This album was driven by Anderson and Howe...and sounds like the others were along for the ride. It doesn't continue the masterful Close To The Edge or tight playing that brought us Fragile and The Yes Album. The result here is a very watered down Yes album that goes on for too long.Four songs over four album sides? That should be a warning sign already."
1,Stinker,When this came out it was the first Yes album released that I didn't/wouldn't buy! I listened to it over at a buddies place and I'm almost certain the reason he bought it was to get rid of people he didn't like. This album is a chore!! Tales is just soooooo introverted and pretentious that it is the definition of self-indulgent wankery.We wrote a review of Tales for the school newspaper when it came out and it was the only time we couldn't bring ourselves to listen to the album as we were writing. Painfully boring boring boring! I honestly can't understand why anyone would like this album. Tales is without doubt as tedious as any political filibuster and to be forced to listen to this never ending album (CD) would have to be considered cruel and unusual punishment for even the most heinous crimes against society.I like Yes but this one's a real stinker!
1,One listen and I was seasick,"This is a terrible record. Consisting of four 20 minute long songs this has to be one of the most boring records ever recorded. I was once told that the long passages of monotonous mellotron are supposed to remind you of being on an ocean. I can see that, because, like the ocean, these songs go on forever, seldom change, and there is no end in sight to them on the horizon. The only person I could recommend this cd for is someone who suffers from insomnia. Everyone else should stay away from this overpriced sleeping pill."
1,WORST CD EVER!!,"Well, heres the story. An uncle of mine gave me this for christmas 'cuz I love Radiohead. He said that I would like this too. Boy was he wrong!Radiohead are genuiuses this is CRAP. Every song is half an hour long and BORING. As if that wasn't enough they put on some extra songs (rehearsals or something) that are also LONG and BORING.If you want interesting music that rocks check out anything by Radiohead, Incubus, Staind, Limp Bizkit and Marylin Manson. This is just JUNK!Say NO to 'Yes'!!"
3,Ambitious,"Not one of the worst albums of all time. This is music from a group of young men who reached as high as they could reach. Sometimes they hit the mark, sometimes they don't. A challenging album to listen to."
4,"Good Prog, but not as good as Close to the Edge","Tales From Topographic Oceans, one of the most highly controversial albums (becasue everything is so LONG!) released. Even though I've had this album for a long time, I still haven't been able to digest all of it (I've listented to it plenty of times, but...). This is a true love-it-or-hate-it album. I recommend it for a notch above the casual Yes fan. I gave it 4 stars because, it's so long!! AHHH"
4,A bit too lengthy,"I like many of the melodies, instrumental solos and far-out lyrics on this album, but there is somewhat too much filler and dead-time. It sounds like four brief songs that have been stretched out to near unlistenability. Still, some of the material is nice. It is an opportunity to expand one's listening horizons (and attention span)."
5,THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WORKS OF MUSIC,"WHEN I FIRST HEARD CLOSE TO THE EDGE, I WAS ENTRANCED. WHEN I HEARD THIS. I WAS OVERWHELMED!! THIS IS NOT COMMERCIAL STUFF. THIS IS MUSIC."
2,Size Doesn't Matter,"This mostly-awful double-album is the epitome of prog-rock excess -- and this comes from a person who loves the three Yes albums previous to this monstrosity. Actually, there is *some* value to it -- the first track is composed of some compelling musical passages and interesting shifts. It all falls apart quickly after that, though, devolving into really appalling, unfocused nonsense. The lyrics (never a strong point with Yes) are so incomprehensible and obviously meaningless that one wonders why they are even present. Keyboardist Rick Wakeman himself once described the album as an exercise in ""wading though a cesspool to get a waterlily."" There are some excellent Yes albums, but this is one of the real bombs."
5,Not for everyone,"Judging by the reviews there are a lot of seasoned Yes fans who just don't like this cd. I happen to really like 'Tales'.Someone called it 'not for the meditative faint of heart'. That's a true statement. There are some 'out there' moments that would seem to fit into a new age recording. But it works for me in this setting.'Tales' is not for everyone. True, the songs are a bit more experimental than you'll find elsewhere. Some listeners might even find it a bit weird. But Yes is a prog rock band and I think they needed to push the envelope some. This is where they pushed!So even if you're a big Yes fan you might be taking a chance with this cd. But it's not the end of the world. If you buy it and hate it then give it a bad review and blast me out for recommending it.Hopefully you'll find it to be as enjoyable as I have found it to be."
3,1000 X Maybe,"No, it isn't the worst recording in rock history (no such thing). No, it isn't the greatest recording in rock history (no such thing). Yes, track 3 is the ""difficult"" track (one expects, about halfway through Steve Howe's acoustic solo, the definitive thudwhack of ""Roundabout"" to careen in but no- -it's the difficult track and twee must reign). That mine is here the 82nd commentary on this album some 27 years after its initial release on LP (1973) is something in itself. Many will follow. If the album is so awful (and it is) then why all the insidious defense? If the album is so great (and it is) then why all the insidious detraction? Why is this album controversial at all? Yes, fans and foes. Yes. Bloated and beautiful; majestic and portentious; pretentious and astounding- -it's Yes."
1,Yes sounding very bloated.,"This album is very boring. The vinyl had one song on each side (four in all). By the time you got thru the first album, you couldn't bear the thought of listening to the second disc. This album continues to collect dust in my collection."
2,Unlistenable,"This is one of those albums I compare to Miles Davis ""Bitches Brew"":No matter how much I try to listen and enjoy these ""Masterpieces"" I find myself I can't listen to the whole album... I start getting nervous... perhaps if they had reduced it to a single LP...I'm sorry for myself!"
1,Stinker of Stinkers!,"This album is naff, it's a real stinker from beginning to end. It's self indulgent, pompous and boring. 4 Overlong tracks of symphonic sludge. Gone is Bill Bruford's crisp but enigmatic drum technique. Gone is Chris Squire crunchy bass riffs. In comes synthesisers galore, temples bells , stampeding elephants, you name it everything was thrown on this album. The album was a huge disappointment as the 3 previous studio recordings had the best Yes line up.So why am I commenting on it?.The album is a bench mark. It has become a point of reference of where rock music went wrong. It was a major that ignited the New Wave.Considering all the rubbish that is around now, we need something as horrible as this to trigger off something completely different! ."
1,"The liner notes are worthy of ""Spinal Tap""-like legend","It's been a long time since I've heard this piece of pretentious rubbish, but what I remember the most is laughing out loud at the ridiculous liner notes. Jon Anderson pontificates about finding the meaning of our existence in a hotel room in Tokyo, reading about Tantric yoga and the number 4 or something like that. Reading this crap reminded me of Spinal Tap, in that the whole thing seemed to be a parody of pretentious, prog rock excess, when in fact it was the real thing! As far as the music goes, I just remember Wakeman's pointless solos and Jon Anderson's PIERCING tenor. Ouch! A roomie in college used to play this CD a lot and I had to beg him to not play it anymore. He compromised and agreed only to play ""The Yes Album"" and ""Fragile"" when I was home, while I agreed not to play various non-prog selections in his presence. Anyway, I've gone on too long. I won't say YES is devoid of worth, but this album certainly is."
2,Derivative of Themselves,"My recollection from listening to this over twenty years ago was that it failed to live up to the total concept experience it was supposed to be, and instead ended up being derivative of other Yes works. There are points where you think they're about to kick it up to notches unknown as the great Emeril says, but then they fall way short and grab a riff from earlier works. Again, this is working from twenty-some year old memories, but the impression of it has remained through the years."
5,This is Yes' Masterpiece!,"I bought the original album which had an excerpt from Jon Anderson explaining how he got the idea for these four different concepts while reading the Hindu Shastras. Unfortunately, that except is not available with the cd you buy today.This is an absolute masterpiece!Only true Yes fans will take the time to listen to it over and over again before they start getting the idea behind this music!Their use of constantly changing time signatures and tempos. Complex rhythmic structures and syncopation's along with such carefully laid out movements in symphonic and classical form would have even Bach praising this music himself. Can only be described as 'classical progressive rock"". This is 1974 people! What has happened to music? If you're a fan of Yes and have a little understanding about music, this one is a definite for your collection! Enjoy!"
3,not what I expected,"I was hoping for a book that covered every model, including major model year changes with specifications for them. While the book does have some very good information I wanted more specifications for EVERY model & model year cars."
4,student review,Purchased this book for class. This book is the first edition from 2007. Current edition out is 2011. Was able to use the book for most class assignments. Subject matter was pretty good. Would have preferred the most recent edition but the price was just right at over 60% cheaper.
3,so so,"I like how the book was written. Flow was good, easy to read and understand.This particular product smelled funny ... smoke perhaps. Every time I open the book for class I am bombarded by the smell."
5,Great memory when right settings are used,"Initially I had some troubles when paired these sticks with the Asus P5NE-Sli motherboard because some tweaking must be done in the bios: set voltage to 2.178v and timings to 4-4-4-12-2, rest in auto and disable sli-ready memory. I found this on the Corsair Forums, which is quite useful.These memories are capable of overclock up to 900-950 Mhz without relaxing the timings, and can reach up to 1200Mhz with proper cooling and timings of 5-5-5-15-2.They benchmark amazingly: Using Everest Professional Edition comparison, always reached the first 4 spots, including two number ones.You can't go wrong. In fact, I just acquired my second pair for Windows Vista Ultimate 64 (remember 32 bits OSes can't use that much memory)."
5,Great,"I've had this RAM for a little under a year now and have had absolutely no problem whatsoever. They work perfectly and you can use every bit of those 2GB (not like some where they won't let you use more than 1.8GB of their capacity or something stupid like that). At any rate, I'd highly recommend them for anyone who is considering adding RAM to their computer. And $50 for 2GB is a GREAT price. When I got them, they were around $120."
3,No EPP.,"Everest doesn't recognize them as EPP like my first two, and i buyed exactly the same item that i buyed a year ago. So, or Amazon send me the wrong ones or Corsair isn't including EPP on this ones anymore. But back then they costed 99$, i guess 50$ later you have to give up on something, but product description should reflect the lack of EPP."
4,Simcity 4 for iMac,"I have an iMac with an Intel processor bought in 2009, and I didn't have any problems installing and running the game. Graphics are good. The game has occasionally stopped unexpectedly, but this has been a very infrequent issue. Now I do frequent ""saves"" during the game to avoid losing my work. Right now the largest city that I have has 42,000 Sims, and I hope that the program continues running smoothly as this population increases and the game becomes more graphic intense. It is not a very easy game, and may take a while for you to have a positive cash balance while allowing the city to grow and make improvements to it. It would have been great to have a view mode in which you could check the transportation network only, such as bus stops, roads, and railways. But overall, you will have a great time playing simcity 4."
3,awesome game for PC but its a terrible version for Mac.,I used to play simcity 4 deluxe on PC when it first came out. I played it non-stop for over 16 months! i just got this game for Mac and am extremely disappointed in the franchise. they totally butchered what i considered to be one of the best games ever made. theres tons of bugs that make this Mac version unstable. even the patches do not help. the graphix are pathetic. my graphix control panel doesnt even work... the graphix are worse than simcity 2000. I am VERY disappointed.
1,Not For MacBook,"Sim City 4 is an awesome game, I've been playing it for years on my pc and would play for hours. Recently I got a mac and found out that there was also a mac version, so I bought, installed it, and was EXTREMELY disappointed. There are tons of bugs in the game, some graphics flicker a lot and there is a huge delay time between when you click a button in the game and it actually does what you want it to do...it's very frustrating, even with all the visual effects on their lowest performance possible, the game still runs unbelievably slow and is not worth 60 dollars AT ALL. The game still runs slow even with the patch released. I'll be playing this game on my pc and returning the mac version."
3,Nice Game...Not as nice as Windows version...,"I think it's great that SimCity 4 is available for the Macintosh operating system. The only problem is it doesn't have half as many features as the Windows version. No building editor, no nothing. You also do not gain access to the EA website which is half the fun of the entire game! Being able to download new buildings and create maps from real world terrain! Not only that but the price sucks. One half the features for double the price. Typical."
3,decent,"I started playing this game in February and played for about 2 weeks when I no longer could keep my patience with the atrocious lack of performance. This game should not have been released or the requirements for your system should have been higher. The recommended 256 mb RAM and 32 mb on the graphics card are not sufficient to build a region of interconnected cities, which is the major new feature of this game compared to previous versions.Yes, the graphics are better, the interface is somewhat improved, but the poor performance and some tragic changes for the worse makes this game a big disappointment."
1,The other reviewers are right.,"I usually read reviews before buying something on Amazon, and this was no exception.I generally don't pay a lot of attention to reviewers who complain about software crashes and incompatibility issues because I realize there are a lot of computer users who don't bother (or know how) to update the game with patches and updates that are usually available online.In this case, the reviews about not working on a newer Mac are completely accurate. I have a 17 inch MacBookPro (with intel processor) running OS 10.6 and even with every patch and update available, the game is very unreliable. It crashed frequently, and thankfully, early enough in the game that I had not spent too much time starting to build a city.Too bad - I have played Sim City games in the past and really enjoyed the series. I will not be ordering another game like this for my Mac again any time soon unless it's a newer release that has proper support from the manufacturer."
1,Simply a problem,"I played it once and it was great, but it didn't want to minimize so i could work on other things. I had to quit and save to work on other things. When i went to play again the next day it kept saying i have to re-launch. After four days of that, i gave up and chucked it. I must say though that the delivery was amazingly fast (four days) for delivering to Taiwan. No problem with the seller, just the product."
1,Unable to get it to run on Mac OS X 10.6,"Couldn't get the software to run on OS X 10.6. I think it needs a patch, but the patch wasn't available on the publisher's website. Had to return it."
2,Not made to run on a Mac,"I love the Sim City games and this is a good addition to the series. However, something is wrong with the programming and it simply runs too slow on a Mac."
3,Hardest game ever in Simcity history!,"This game is hardest game in history. Every time, I tried to build a town I failed, I have no money, I was fired from the office. You have to make town beautiful such as place open grass, park, etc. which makes game even harder.If you have a Mac that runs Mac OS 9, I recommend to play Simcity 3000. But if you want a very hard game, then Simcity 4 is for you!"
1,BORING,"I bought the first Sim City several years ago and I loved it. I have been buying later versions, but have been getting more and more dissatified. The problem is that I never liked Sim City in the manner it was always inteneded. When I a kid, I loved construction toys. That is how I used the original Sim City. I used a cheat which gave me all the $$$ I needed and turned off disasters. I just wanted to build cities. I had no interest in it as a game being mayor. The best sim city 4 cheat I found so far is for an extra $1000.0. Doesn't really do it for me. As a game it is just boring."
1,Too bad about Intel Mac,It's too bad this game does not run on an Intel Mac.I used to enjoy it on my G4 but when I upgraded to a new Mac Pro and installed the game it repeatedly crashed. Support from the company Aspyr says unfortunately it does not run on Intel Mac.
1,This Game is Awful on Mac Platform,"I was ripped off when I purchased this game. IT WILL NOT WORK properly on a standard iMac Pro OS X platform. I contacted customer service at Aspyr and they said, ""The game was designed for the Power PC processor and doesn't get along with the Intel processor very well. It's an older title. Sorry.""Save your money. Do not buy this game!"
3,"CD2 is awesome, CD1 ummm","Well lets see CD2 is great. Peak time sound is the best way to describe it. Basically this means this is the kind of music you want to listen to as your just about to enter a club on a Saturday night. Sebs Hooligans mix of Open your eyes is awesome because it doesnt have the stupid refrain open your eyes and see the child you are in it. Song 2 MIro OHHH MY GOD: simple so simple but so good. 3 and 4 are average...but then you reach 5 and then the rest is gold from there EXCEPT FOR AVENUE....GOD I HATE THIS SONG! Pvd is awesome but please this song TOTALLY doesnt fit in here. I dont like CD1 but I mean IM really not into that whole style of music way too loud and noisy for my liking, but some may like it. Anyways CD2 is almost perfect and makes this a good buy if you can tolerate tech house or whatever the music on cd1 is called."
1,Don't buy this for content,"I bought the Barron's AP Enviro review because it is the only review book for this AP exam and besides CollegeBoard, it is the only other source for AP Enviro questions.Barron's probably makes the poorest exam review books on the market, Princeton review making the best.I highly advise you not to purchase it, even if you're looking for review. The book focused on material not on the test (it suggests that you memorize every piece of US environmental legislation, for example), and its practice reviews (the sole reason I bought the book) were nothing like the exam.The style of the practice questions and its subject matter are not like the AP exam!If you need review for the exam, I suggest reviewing your textbook and notes and not waste money on this paper-waster."
1,AP Review book not up to snuff,"I am an environmental science teacher. The test is over for one more year and this book was only of moderate help. The test is becoming more technical by the year. None of this material was covered. As others have said, the laws and the people were not part of the test beyond a couple of obvious ones such as Garrett Hardin. It's better than nothing but one shouldn't use it to the exclusion of their teacher's guidance."
2,same AS ALWAYS,"I take it (after reading this book) that this lot's no stranger to big globe trotting and world saving adventures. Gives them a head start on events to come , unfortunately after a few pages worth i got the distinct impression that it was another weis/hickman rip off. I mean bringing Sargonnas into krynn / an ally of the dark queen? Why cut it short and settle for an assistant when you can get the five headed dragon herself. A weak attempt of copying/masking the Takhisis scenario already done in by enough writers that it becomes to old for my taste. The companions portrayal here were bland. Not one of them really shone , neither as a whole ; which should be the basic concept here. Advertising wise it said : see the companions in their first adventure. Right... what adventure? you mean the same adventure. The books not bad it's just a tad unoriginal."
3,"Not spectacular, but a good read","Admittedly, ""The Companions"" isn't the best novel when it comes to DragonLance. But Tasslehoff, Fesz, and Dogz really shine in this book. The plot is rather weak and unbelievable (ten or so people and a handful of kyrie destroy the minotaurs?) but isn't fantasy about overcoming impossible odds and heroism? I enjoyed the book, and while it doesn't rank as the best of novels, it is by no means amongst the worse."
4,Good Book,"I liked this book better than the other Dragonlance books (not written by Weis or Hickman). I felt more like it was a Dragonlance book, then someone trying to write a Dragonlance book. The plot was pretty good, if never overly exciting. Tas, however, made it worthwhile (as always). Overall, I would recommend this book to any Dragonlance fan."
2,"Disappointing, does no justice to Heroes of the Lance series","Some notes on the ""failure"" of the author as a fantasy writer:1. Using the word ""Okay"". When did fantasy characters learnAmerican colloquialisms?2. Getting her facts wrong. The Heroes of the Lance never knewthere was a city underneath the Blood Sea of Istar3. Stupid grammatical errors. (intentional?) How does the term""powerful loins"" appeal to you? Have you ever known anybodywho had ""powerful loins""? Wow.What a waste of time. I never even finished it."
2,Where are the characters?,"Companions is a vast disappointment. All the main Heroes of the Lance are there but as seems to be the case outside of the core Dragonlance (Chronicles and Legends) everything is purely plot-driven rather than actually revealing more about a character. Others in the Meetings Sextet (Dark Heart, Kindred Spirits) at least try to explore the individuals. But here is nothing more than a straightforward plot about evil wishing to raise an evil god and good stopping them. When in doubt, throw in a bunch of new mysterious life forms!"
3,Not bad...but not good,"First off...I am in the process of reading sixty or so dragonlance novels so click on my name for reviews of previous books....i'm reading them in order...now to this book...the Companions...This book is an ok adventure...I don't like the new species added in prequels. There are also some timeline problems with Raistlin. It is a readable book, though. I would read it if you want to see the companions in an adventure, and it's right in the middle of the books I have read. Definately better than Huma and Elven nation trilogy...Three Stars...An ok read."
1,"Don't judge other books in the series by this one, Please!","I was really disappointed by this book. The writing is terrible - like the book I tried to write when I was 8, except it's 300 odd pages long and someone must have actually given the author money for it. The story is essentially like any disaster movie: meet the characters, have a few foreboding encounters with the bad guys, climax (ho hum) where some weird and previously unheard of allies suddenly spring to their aid. Character development is poor and inconsistent with other, far superior, Dragonlance novels. Even if you've just read the previous 5 novels in the sextet (as I had), I'd advise you to forego reading this, it illuminates nothing."
1,What a waste.,"This is not just the worst Dragonlance novel I have ever read, it is one of the worst books, period. I cannot believe TSR published this awful excuse for a novel. This must be Tina Daniell's first (and last, I hope) fantasy novel. I can imagine the preview if ""The Companions"" was a movie: ""You'll howl with laughter as Tasslehoff takes an ""evil"" potion, and cuts of Sturm's moustache! Ha ha, ouch! Now, that's evil! You'll cringe as he paints his room black, proving his depravity! Watch out, folks! He means business!""But hey folks, if you can overlook plot chasms, awful syntax, and a boring and preposterous story that clearly never actually happened in the Dragonlance universe(one of the reasons we liked reading about Tanis and Raistlin and Sturm was that they were basically just ordinary people who became heroes through chance. If the events in this novel are valid, they saved Krynn years before the War of the Lance)then this is the book for you!"
4,Good book..yet rushed.,"As i read this book, i was pulled into it like i am with most books. I couldnt really put it down, though it did have slow parts, and scenes that seemed to have been just cut from the final printing..maybe that is just me, but i felt that things should have been explained a lot better than they were. But it was altogether a good book, and i did enjoy reading it. The only thing that i didnt like about it, was that the climax of the book..that last 20 pages or so, seemed to go by to quickly, with major gaps in the storyline. Tina did a good job in writing the book, i would say that her only flaws were leaving out a little too much info here and there.. But i do recommend it to any dragonlance fan."
2,Who's kidding who?,"All in all a interesting book, But with some story line faults. Ok seeing that the setting is before Rastlin's test, How did he get those hour glass eyes as stated on Page 21 ""the flickering fire in Rastlin's intense hour glass eyes"". I think the editor should proof read befor publishing. The other thought is with the new strange creatures such as the helpful Kyrie, Why didn't The heros of the lance call upon them to help during the war of the lance? Well this was a interesting story but don't count on this one to follow true to any story line you may of already read."
3,they do this to much,I have read my share of dragonlance and althought this book was good it was not perfect.not enought charecter and to much saving the world.this book takes away from chronicls by giving the companions expiriance in saving the world.this is the first time and chronicls is the secend.so read it after chronicls to beter get the feel of unlikly heros. otherwise a solid read.
5,Seeking and Learning can be Stimulating.,"As I had read the first book in this series, it was only natural to continue on to the second. It is full of information that is both useful and potent. I have never thought that my quest would lead me to such enjoyable reading and learning at the same time. It is up to the reader to believe or disbelieve. One must try and conquer the unknown to gain knowledge. I am glad I had gained the knowledge. Thank Mr. Monroe for the opportunity!!!"
1,"More sexist, racist drivel...Highly offensive material","Monroe's books are racist, sexist to the extreme and show way too much delight in the magical powers of little blond boys. Disgusting that this type of material gets printed and called druidism. Druidism is none of the above!"
1,A Silly Book.,"This book, while somewhat more entertaining than it`s predecesor, is fictional nonsense. while most people reviewing this book are clueless as to what druidism is anyway,and that includes Mr.Bonewits(If you ever attended one of his lame ""Seminars""...you would realize he is nothing more than a yuppie environmentalist...ie: a college puke who`s favorite word is ""Neopagan""....And no, isaac ,you CAN`T be both a wiccan AND a druid at the same time!)One should also avoid books written by Ross Nichols Too!"
5,Superb Work,"It seems that Douglas Monroe has gone and done it again. This Book is of the same caliber as ""the 21 lessons of Merlyn."" I would reccomend it to anyone interested into Druidism that is not of the Neopaganized form. Many would disagree with me, but well, they can go and sit on a stump for all I care. The practices in this work compliment the inititory rites of the first volume. I particularily like the exercise on ""Bindu Suspension"". Good job Douglas, I am in your debt."
2,More of the same,"Monroe's done it again, all right. He's packaged pseudo-Celticdrivel into a hack novel and dubbed it Druidic Truth. Anyone who hasthe utter gall to quote DJ Conway as proof of his ridiculous claim that women were not Druids is no expert. He obviously has no idea that a dryad was a Greek tree spirit and not a priestess, else he wouldn't have used such an inaccurate source. His attempted defense of the Charm of Making, aka the plagiarized chant of Merlin in the film Excalibur, is equally weak. His ""Druidic Magic"" is stolen straight from Thelemic ritual, and poorly at that. I'd give it one star, but telling a good tall tale counts for something. This is one of the tallest I've read since the adventures of Paul Bunyan and Babe. Stay away from this book if you value the truth. Buy it if you want a laugh or are willing to use a mislabeled, misrepresented, mishandled system and call it Celtic."
5,great book,no problems getting book and it arrived in very good condition. It was a gift to my son and he enjoyed it emensley
5,Some folks just dont get it.,Some folks just dont get it. Monroe brings back the sense of mystery. You read the book and BANG. You put it down and go OUTSIDE.... Wonderful.....
2,Marginally Better Sequel,"The follow-up companion to ""The 21 Lessons of Merlyn"", this book is a sincere attempt by the author to put down his personal philosophy, spiritual system and magical work. Using questionable sources, the author comes to conclusions that are highly controversial and difficult to substantiate. Much like its prequel, I recommend this book only as a work of fiction or as a way of separating the truth from the nonsense."
2,The Iolo Morgannwg of our times,"Visionary or con-man? Keeper of arcane knowledge or blatant forger? Centre of controversy? Oh yeah!All these questions were asked, with equal justification, about Iolo aka Edward Williams. And some of the key elements of modern Druidry come from his work. ""Authentic"" or not (and of course, he claimed it was, just as Mr Monroe does) it's working for a lot of people.Is it a credible or effective magical path? You don't know until you try."
1,Don't waste your money,"Poor quality sets, acting, plot and overall budget. Production value very low. I normally enjoy films produced outside of the mainstream, but this effort falls very short."
4,Not a great Mizoguchi film...but very good.,"Kenji Mizoguchi is one of the few filmmakers in the history of cinema whose entire body of work is worth seeking out. Mizoguchi was referred to as the Shakespeare of cinema and in the pure breadth, diversity, brilliance and humanity of his films that title is not far from the truth. This is one of my least favorite of his films (altough I dislike The 47 Ronin) much more. A must-see if you are a die hard Mizoguchi fan (like myself) or a fan of period romances or tales of intrigue and corruption in 8th century Japan."
3,fun but flimsy,"I love the pictures on the puzzles, but the pieces are flimsy compared to the Ravensberger ones we have. We do them over and over, so quality is important."
5,A very good book,"This book is not one of the ""feel good"" positive thinking books that have confused many people over the years. Instead, it explains worry from productive and unproductive perspectives. The book is well written and the case studies are fascinating. The author's light heartedness is delightful and enhances the meaningful information he imparts. Dr. Leahy builds on other books I have enjoyed which recognize that negative thinking can be helpful as long as we don't dwell on it. I highly recommend this book and Dr. Rosalene Glickman's classic best-selling book, Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self and Dr Julie Norem's book, The Positive Power of Negative Thinking. With these three books, you will have the ultimate combination to make the most of life."
4,Excellent Resource,"The information is presented in a concise, understandable manner. I have used with a couple of clients and it has helped educate them about anxiety. It reinforces the information that I give them and reinforces the interventions that they will need to practice to successfully deal with their worry and anxiety. It is a nice adjunct to his larger workbook."
2,Worry Cure Review,"This book is quite complicated and not an easy read. I liked the topic, but I haven't even opened it since I got it, it's not written in a way that makes it reader friendly and succinct."
4,Comprehensive and authoritative,"This book is a well-written, well-organized self-help manual for people who worry excessively. Written by an expert in cognitive therapy, the material guides you through seeing the specific ways in which you as an individual might worry and how to deal with these types of problems."
2,Worry cure,"Robert Leahy's book is well written and backed by sound research. It gives direct and clear instruction on what you can do. While acknowledging that each person is complex and ""one size fits all solutions"" won't work. After reading this book however I sometimes ask myself if the cure isn't as bad as the disease."
2,"Repetitive, sloppy","It's 300 pages; should have been 150. Author starts repeating himself by the third chapter. I did find it useful, but it is frustratingly sloppy. For instance, after taking one of the lengthy questionnaires I discovered that of the 10 personality styles I fit the ""schizoid"" style most closely. Yikes. I was dying to know what that meant, but the descriptions of the 10 styles on pg. 61 end after the seventh style."
3,"Overly dry, and sometimes smug book on liberalism","Bruce Ackerman's 1980 work ""Social Justice in the Liberal State"" is long, mostly boring, and gives a ton of examples using manna that can be infurating convulted. Ackerman does make a few good points about liberalism, but life-changing and set for our world, I think not. Maybe its because I don't have a degree in political science nor do I have a major in that field, but I don't understand how anyone could highly praise this book. It's not that well-written and most insights are obscured by clumsy phrases and pretentious jargon."
5,Perfect size,"These replacement filters fit perfectly for the same brand of compost buckets, and they bring the filter and second layer that needs to be replaced as well."
2,Can't seem to find the right size,"This was the wrong size filter, but I find it next to impossible to determine which one is the right size for my compost bin. The suggested filters are not it and there aren't consistent measurements / matches for filters to bins."
3,Compost pail filters,"These were exactly the type I replaced. They work really well until I rinse them (not often, but periodically I find they need it) and then they tend to not stay in place as well. I think they are a bit pricey also, but were still the best I could find."
3,Stinky compost - no more,"This is a very good product, however I gave it three stars because it is a little pricey, and I find that they don't last very long. Otherwise it is great"
3,they don't seem to fit my 1 1/2 gallon pail very well,"I could find no real guide to the size I neede but these don't stay in the filter hole, I still don't know if I ordered the right thing."
2,Wrong Size,"Does not fit the 1.5 gallon compost pail I bought on Amazon. The packaging does not state a size on it, so it is understandable. The description needs to be more complete. The replacement filters I got are too big, but I will make it fit by trimming it myself. It's not worth returning, but I won't order again."
4,Good replacement product,Was unable to find these in any store. Don't know why. Really work well to block the smell in a small apartment. Only complaint is when the mold begins to grow on them.
3,You need them,"You can't use the pail without these filters. They are definitely needed to block out any smell. The only problem is that they don't last nearly as long as they say they will. I get 2 months max before the smell starts to sink through. Still, if you love using your compost pail, then it's worth it."
1,Useless,"I assumed these were standard sizes. They don't fit my compost pail and it's only because of jerryrigging them that I am able to use them at all. Before you purchase, make sure you've got the right size pail."
2,USC Sucks,"...but UCLA swallows. ""My maid went to UCLA"", ""University of Spoiled Children"" ""University of Caucasians Lost among Asians""...yada yada yada. You have heard all of this tired garbage before. Save your five bucks and put gas in your moped."
3,So/so,It was rather cheap but arrived on time and did the job for one Halloween. My brother liked the costume. Doubt it would last a year though.
2,Not quite like the photo in advertisement (as usual),"My main reason for returning this costume was the mask & headpiece. The mask is NOT white as shown, but is a ""dingy yellowish"" white that looks awful with the red/black costume. A white mask like the one pictured would have looked excellent in contrast to the red/black. The headpiece doesn't stay in place, especially the ""points"" on top - they flip flop all over the place due to the design and being VERY sparingly stuffed with polyfill. The little plastic skulls on the ends of them are too heavy and weigh them down (design flaw).Also, be aware that the black gloves are not included. I already knew this prior to purchasing, but just wanted to make a note of it for those who weren't aware of it."
4,overall,this item is just as I thought it would be according to the description. perfect condition. well worth it.
3,Warped Mask,"Everyone loved the costume! Mask was warped though and torn up on the inside so I had to flatten it out with something heavy. It was also hard to breathe out of and kept getting sweaty on the inside. I'm only 5'3 and small, but the medium was a pretty good size for me and fit well. The head part with the ""tails"" were big and kinda bulky, but stayed in place for the most part. Overall a good costume, pretty cheap, and looks evil! Doesn't come with accessories."
2,It had its faults,"The mask is pretty much worthless, unless you dont have a NOSE..The mask is flat, no room for a humanbeing with a nose..SO that makes the mask unuseable.the rest of the costume was ok.."
1,Terrible Book!,This book teaches children that getting angry and running away are the ways to solve problems. I threw this book away the same day it arrived. I wish the option existed to have zero stars.
2,Inappropriate Recommendation for Anger Control,"I was shocked after receiving this to see that when Sophie is angry she copes with her anger by running and running and running until she feels better. The pictures show her running alone into what looks like a forest. Then she goes by a big lake and sits in a big tree, again all alone. When she finally feels better she walks home. It appears that she's gone far away on her journey. She is a young girl and certainly this is not what you want your child to do. I wish they'd said she goes in the back yard and runs or that she goes in her room and takes herself away through visualization to these places."
5,When Sophie is Angry,"This is about Sophie when she is angry. She gets angry when her sister grabbed gorilla. When she is angry, she shouts and screams. When she doesn't scream and shouts, she is calm and not angry. When you are angry, I recommend you calm yourself down! This is a good book. I want you to read this book!!!by, Hyeyoun"
2,I DO NOT recommend this book...,"I don't understand all these great reviews. The girl in the story gets so angry that she roars, and runs away alone. Then she comes home after she calms down and everything's fine again. I don't see the value in this story. Maybe if they had her parents explain ALTERNATIVES to running away when angry if would be good, but I'm astonished at how great everyone thinnks this story is. I'm returning my copy."
4,A Bedtime Favorite,"My 2-1/2 year old daughter absolutely loves this book! She wants to read it every night before bedtime ... and I mean EVERY night! She loves the illustrations and especially likes for us to use inflection in our voices when reading about the different emotions Sophie feels. When we first rec'd this book as a gift, I wasn't sure how I liked it ... but I'm just the mom, not the child! She's the real critic, and she gives it a big ""thumbs up""!"
1,Not a good message,I am a mother of a 5 1/2 year old spirted child and was in a book store trying to find a book that may help guide her towards a better outlet for her anger. This one is available in Read A Long format so I bought it. My husband and I reviewed it before giving it to our daughter and were appalled that the book has Sophie running away!! 'Run away' when you are angry is NOT the message we want to give our child. It is disturbing that this book has such a high rating.
3,Concern for safety,"The title of this book describes exactly what the book is about. For children who have similarly dramatic reactions to being angry, this book could be very reassuring that they are not alone. It also provides some strategies for children about how to calm down. Unfortunately, one of the behaviors that the child uses is to run and run and run. For impulsive and young children this could be misinterpreted and has made me somewhat reluctant to use it with the children in my practice that are at the age that the book would seem most useful. The art work is well done, and would be an excellent choice for a child who was not going to take it too literally."
5,when sophie gets angry,"thanks for the book - the girls loved it. we read each time they have their meltdowns. thanks again, really great."
3,"Great book, but printing fragile","This is a great story but the ink in this edition doesn't seem as durable as the copy we had from the library. When pages are bent, the color creases out. Do you know what I mean?"
5,SEL Classic,"This is one of my absolute favorite books for young children to learn about recognizing and managing their emotions. (That's called Social Emotional Learning in teacher-speak.) This book is an SEL classic!My husband and I read this book over and over to our son when he was little. Just like Sophie, my son was often ""a volcano ready to explode"". When he was little, we talked with him about how he often felt like Sophie and got really, really angry. But we also talked about how Sophie learned to calm down, and rejoin her family in a positive way."
1,DO NOT BY THIS BOOK! PROMOTES UNSAFE BEHAVIOR!!,"We have literally over 1000 children's books and THIS book is the first book we have ever had to get rid of. I bought this book thinking it would be a great way to teach managing emotions, such as anger, and instead, was appalled at this story line. This book is about a little girl who gets soooooo angry she runs away! This book basically teaches a child that if you need to go somewhere else, just go. Dont worry about telling anyone, just go and blow off some steam, and when you come home, your family will be waiting for you, glad that you came home, but more importantly, glad that you were able to blow off some steam. ABSURD! My daughter is 3 1/2, I do not think it is acceptable to run away into the woods behind our house whenever she is angry. I can't believe people think this is a good book!"
2,Angry? Just run away.,The only alternative to getting angry and lashing out that this book offers is to run away into the woods. I don't think that's a great solution.
4,"OK book, I don't agree with telling kids to run and hide","the book is good for feeling, but the way to deal with those feelings is not the books strong point."
2,Didn't live up to its potential,"I bought this for my 4-year old because of the Caldecott Honor award and the high praise here . . . but it was disappointing.The idea has potential, but the story is too simple and obvious, with no learning potential: ""girl gets angry because a toy is taken away from her, so she runs then sits quietly in the forest then goes home and everything is fine"".That is NOT all I'm teaching my son about managing anger and conflict resolution . . . maybe I'll write my own book on this . . :-)"
2,Not a good solution for angry children,"This book does not provide a realistic scenario for helping children and the adults in their lives deal with anger. The situation was a typical sequence for a child getting really angry. But who would let their young child out to roam that far (even in make believe) when they are so upset? This option is not a safe, satisfying or rectifying option for angry children. Indeed, the underlying message is ""Go away if you're upset, we don't want you around here!"" I would love to see this storyline suggest that a parent (or significant adult) will help by trying to understand the child, help the child feel calm again, and show the child ways to gracefully recover from intense emotions."
4,"When Sophie Gets Angry - Really, Really Angry","I bought ""When Sophie Gets Angry..."" because I have a granddaughter named Sophie and she looks a bit like the book cover. The story is ok and a quick read, but I liked the cover and title a bit more than the story itself."
2,Foster parent,"I will not read this book to the kids in my care. I am looking for books that are accurate for handeling emotions. I do not like the running away and the five year old I have now would do that. I do have several other books I can use, such as the Best Me I Can Be set, but they do not address anger as well as I would like. I do like the illustrations and the way the words sound when reading in this book; I just wish the little girl did not run away."
2,not enough,"when sophie gets angry she runs away and comes back.that's the book. I would have appreciated more content. I understand that after I finish reading the book I talk to my child about how we behave when we get angry, but this could have given more to work with"
1,Sorry. No stars for Sophie,"Someone needs to TEACH her anger management.Sorry, Sophie. No stars for you.And her sister is no better ... snatching the gorilla away?How about some manners, girls??No stars for Sophie's sister either."
2,Give Sophie a chance.,"The fun thing about this book is experiencing (through colors and text) the emotions that Sophie is feeling. We follow Sophie through the reds and yellows of anger to the soothing blues and greens of the natural world, and back again to the warm, vibrant colors of a happy home. The simple text sets off the illustrations, resulting in a rich emotional reading experience for any age.I give ""Sophie"" only two stars simply because it is not my preferred style of picture book, not because it lacks any of the criteria for good children's literature. I encourage you to give ""Sophie"" a chance."
3,"I Liked it, but...","Okay I liked this book, as I like Molly Bangs work, but did anyone notice that the main character was, well...a spoiled brat? Think of it parents. Your assumingly five/six year old screams at the top of her lungs, runs out of the house(alone, and without anyone knowing where she's going!)and comes back. And just for not getting a stuffed animal! But whats more outrageous, Sophie's parents give her less than a slap on the wrist! But maybe a parent could turn it around and show how Sophie acted was wrong. Thats a plus. All in all, the good outweighs the bad. An overly-worried parent might not want their child to read this book. :(Bang's work-as always- is masterful and I would really hate to lift one of those paintings.R"
1,Poor taste,"This book shows how kids do act and if it is used with very careful guidance, I suppose it has some merit.I'm a guidance counselor in elementary school but I'm not a therapist. I recommend books like ""Mad Me"" by Jim and Joan Boulden. They lend themselves to discussion more than this book without being so ""in your face."" It seems a bit irresponsible, that is, unless you are sure your child will read this with a counselor or therapist at his or her side. I see what the writer was trying to do but I agree with those feel it is in poor taste."
4,The original TEN--10!--songs + 9 bonus tracks,"The previous reviewer stumps me--this is Donna Loren's original album(""Beach Blanket Bingo"")plus NINE bonus tracks! What is there to be disappointed about? The first ten songs were included on Donna's Capitol album and the rest are all bonuses(including the rare single-only ""Call Me"" b/w ""Smokey Joes"" and another single, ""Ten Good Reasons"" b/w ""Ninety Day Guarantee""). But he's REALLY wrong in calling Annette Funicello a 'no-talent'(this obviously not true). Both girls were wonderful in the ""Beach"" flicks, but this CD gives fans a chance to hear Donna's renditions of some of Annette's songs. If he wants to be upset about anything, it's the fact that Donna's output from the Challenge label isn't included(I know of one particular song from these early sessions, ""I'm In Love With The Ticket Taker At The Bijou Movie""). Otherwise, RELAX and ENJOY!!!"
3,Could have been better,"I loved Genesis. I saw them twice, once on the tour this album comes from, and loved both shows. This album could have been better, but for some reason it falls flat a bit.Want a great live Genesis album, get LIVE, the first one with Peter Gabrial, or Seconds Out."
2,no opinion about this one but...........,"I am REALLY looking for ""Seconds out"" a 1970's live concert.I saw part of it once on TV, back in the '80s. I would pay TOP DOLLAR for that one. Vaugj@aol.com( John Vaughan)"
4,More Genesis,"This video is OK, but what I'm realy looking for is the film from the ""seconds out"" Tour. The film has a part with Rick Wackeman music and images of Winter sports, the other part is the genesis concert. Does this film exists in VHS or DVD ?"
2,Desapointing,"Desapointingly, this CD album lost the ""forth side"" not Live, the main reson I purchased this album. I wonder where can I find this lost set of musics ??"
3,Not quite as great as I'd expected!,"I am currently in Massage Therapy school & had made many random highlighter marks in my A&P book, which I thought might be able to be erased with his product, however, to my disappointment, it only works on yellow highlighters marks & not all that well... I wish this product worked a bit better... Other than that, I guess it wasn't to expensive a lessen to learn."
5,Australian Composers,"Brilliant book on contemporary composers born after 1950. The biographies are succienct, with up-to-date information. References take you to further information. A must-have for those interested in Australian contemporary music."
5,Suspended In Gaffa,"Dark, chilling, misterious, haunting, GREAT! There are so many hooks in this cd that everytime you listen you hear something new. Kate's beautifull voice fits in very well. Sat In Your Lap is fantastic!! Other good songs: The titletrack; that's one of the most chilling songs I ever heard, Houdini; I like the picture in front of the cd very much, it refers to the song, and Get Out Of My House; with all the different sounds and fantastic dialogue. This cd is always a pleasure to listen!"
2,"Great music, but terrible CD sound","I bought this because it's probably one of Kate's most celebrated albums, but I was terribly disappointed. Yes, the music is great, but the sound on this CD is very harsh and compressed. It sounds like a poor mp3 download really, with all the sound mushed into the midrange. Very unkind to the Kate's layered sound, it's almost unlistenable. I don't know whether this is because it was recorded in the early days of CD technology or whether this copy is simply from a bad master. The CD copy of The Kick Inside that I bought at the same time was fine."
4,Intersting Album,"I have yet to appreciate this album fully. It's not a Kate Bush Album I play very often, but every artist needs to trip out sometime and do something unique. when I get the Remaster I hope I can appriciate it more!"
5,Best.....Thing.....Ever........,"This is the best music in the world. By far. Obviously there is always the whole 'matter of opinion' thing. Hmmmph. Yes the Hounds Of Love is superb, many would say that is Kate's best work. Nah.I would review every song but there is no point. I cant really find to describe. I'd much rather urge you to buy this album, listen to it again and again if you must. You will soon understand.'The Dreaming'. Every song is perfect. I have never got bored of, I doubt I ever will. If I die and go to heaven I will demand a copy."
5,"Excellent, without compare","I loved Kate's earlier albums and I was primed for the release of THE DREAMING, or so I thought. It blew me away! What could be greater than one of your favorite artists producing a massively great album, even better than their previous efforts..? I used to listen to this one each and every morning, it was a great start to the day!She was on fire."
5,Kate Bush in Dark,"This album is probably the darkest of all made by Kate Bush, but also is the album that deffinately establish her as one of the most creative artists of our time and demostrates that she is more than just a great voice. Her lyrics evoke fantasy worlds, sometimes with a poisoning hermetism. But also here, she makes her first experimentation with technified music and celtic music. If you are a Kate Bush fan, this is a must-have Cd for you."
4,Great for those who don't need all the memory.,"I purchased this on sale in my local Target and it's the neatest thing since sliced bread. The USB storage device is simple to use (you don't even have to install any software if you're running Windows 2000/ME or higher) and it stores enough for a good run (52 mp3s has been the max I've been able to put on it so far). This thing eats batteries like candy, so I only give it a 4 star rating. If you do buy this, use lithium AAA batteries, not alkaline- they're more expensive, but they'll last a lot longer."
1,"Save your money for a ""Rio Karma"" or and ""Ipod""","I got this player for my birthday, and at first i was satisfied because i didnt know better. I had to replace the battery very very often, which gets expensive. Also every time i jog or workout, if the player moves, it shuts off because the battery comes out of place. This thing is a waste of money. Save your money, without purchasing this thing, you are $100 closer to a Karma or an Ipod. I'm personally going for the Karma.Whether this helped you or not, i hope you dont waste your money on this thing.Piece of junk. PERIOD."
5,The Best Surprise of 1994,"Kenny Rogers no longer has anything to prove. ""Timepiece"" is simply exquisite! His classic. His ""Stardust."""
5,A wonderful way to spend an hour without leaving your house.,This is truly a delightful cd. The cd description tells the listener that Eda Zari wanted to portray a number of different styles. This is a big challenge for one cd and in my opinion often fails. Eda Zari actually succeeds at this and the result is a wonderful hour of music with a gifted singer. I hope to hear more of Eda Zari.
3,Pretty good for beginners,"He does a good job introducing some beginning and maybe intermediate points about the game (the title is accurate). For the price, I would have expected a lot more. A little disappointing for the money."
3,This isn't really a book...,"So I was a little disappointed to find that out. Not that it cost me or anything, I'm just warning you. Apparently there are two ""Gifts of War"" books out there, both by Larry Towell. But THIS one is the program for the exhibit, it's not the book with the poems and the photographs. So be sure to get the right one and probably not this one!This is a program-like item. It's really thin without a real binding and cover. I'm under the impression that it's something that was handed out at Larry Towell's exhibit of the actual photographs shown in this program. Like it's a little reference guide, the photos are here and numbered and there is a little blurb on what it is you're looking at (on the wall). So that was disappointing. The photographs are good, but they aren't very big because supposedly you are looking at them on the wall.On the plus side there is a little bit of poetry and victim testimonies here, in the very back. But that's it."
1,Do Not Buy,This product claimed to work with both PC and MAC. It did not. I comes with nothing to install it onto your computers and it comes with nothing to actually connect your computers to the product. You end up spending more money and it still doesn't work.
3,Noooo! Please revise this book!,"I must concur with the prior review, the final product, the result of very bad editing, is a disappointing mess.I am completely new to web design, and had bought Foundation Web Design because it covered not just HTML, but all the other essential elements of web design: javascript, cascading style sheets, Flash, etc.The editing is atrocious. What the reader is subjected to are elements of code introduced too early, only to be explained later, references to examples never given, incorrect code (when checked against other books describing the same code), screenshots which do not match what the code actually produces, etc.I looked forward to its ""dumbed down"" presentation, to paraphrase the other Reveiwer, but the flaws in it's final presentation just get too much in the way of learning. For whatever reason, unfamiliarity with the coding, pressure to get the book to press by a certain time, the final product is a very sad disappointment."
2,Poor Headband Design,"I agree with everyone that said this is a great produce. The weak link is the headband. It is very fragile and it did break. The guarantee had expired, but I called JBL to see if I could pay to get the headband replaced. The answer is no. Once the guarantee expires they offer nothing but ""We are sorry."" So I have two problems with JBL. The headband is poorly designed, and they won't fix it even if you pay."
1,Blah blah blah,"I read this book because the preview for the movie looked good. However, I was extremely disappointed. There was a lot of room for this book to have been good. but it reminded me of made for tv show. The characters were weak and sorry. Don't waste your time....."
4,The price is very nice,"For a short bit this was listed about 55 dollars! Great, great pen for that price. Currently listed about 130 and that is a bit much. A touch too heavy for my ideal purposes and a bit back-heavy but still good enough--if the price goes back down--definitely pick one up."
2,"Do not be fooled! Looks like lego, but isn't as good","My son recieved this set as a birthday gift, and was very excited about it. He loves legos and transformers, so what could be better than combining the two? How about a toy that stays together? We put this toy together and found that the pieces do not fit into each other as well as legos do, and the slightest jar to them will send the entire thing into peices. It was very frustrating. You can't glue them together, either, if you want ot be able to ""transform"" it into robot mode.Very Disappointing."
2,Very Light on plot and character development,"this was not a terrible movie, and I must confess up front that crass humor is not my favorite. However, all the characters did a good job with what they were given. The modernization was well handled. And, there are a couple touching moments. That said, some of the moments are ridiculous [the ""War"" scene near the end and the ambitious guy stuck in the mail room at the end]. The plot is very thin and while the writer and director set up the little your perception well at the beginning it wanes through the movie. Also in the area of starts well but falters is the character development of everyone but Jack Black's. So while the movie was watchable, it was so only once."
1,not a kids movie,Saw this with my kids and there was a lot of moments that it had more adult humor than kids humor. Black does so much better in Kung fu Panda. These liners..were re..re..redone way before. Boring and too many groans. Kids were bored..and honestly..so was I! We got to see it free at our theater for a fall special. Glad I didn't pay or we would of left after ten min for money back =P
4,Funny and light hearted!,"Went to see this movie with my mom who's 80 and two girls ages 12&9 (I'm 40), we all thought it was a hoot! I think the person who laughed the most was my mother, life is short laugh!Jack Black was once again just funny with his facial expressions and ordinary looks, which I love. Not meant as a serious movie and I don't understand the bad reviews either."
1,Not Family rated! & Simply horrible,"This movie is not family oriented, as Amazon has it placed. It is more of an Adult show. I don't see what is so funny about urinating on a town that is burning. And it seems that every sentence or conversation involved the word ""sexy"" in it. Really? Is that even needed. This version is a disgrace to the original Gulliver's Travels. Thankfully, I am a parent who watches questionable movies before allowing my children to view it. If they did see this one, I would have been highly upset!!"
1,3D?,the 3D dosent exist. I have 15 3D blu rays and this is by far the worst quality i have seen to date. The movie itself is painful.
1,Not worth a $1 or the time,"Horrible, I watch a lot of ""b"" movies, and can count on one hand how many I turned off before the end, I got about 1/3 of the way thru on this. Horrible"
1,worst 3D effects and poor quality,"We bought the 3D version to use on our Samsung Pn59d7000. The movie would not run in 3D out of the box. It took an Hour of tweaking resolution settings and restarting the BD player software before the movie would run with any semblance of 3D effects. Once we got the settings ironed out (they are sticky, and don't take effect until the programs are restarted) we were disappointed in the 3D quality. This movie appears to us to be adapted from a 2D movie. There were no 3D effects of note at all. We were disappointed to see that Jack Black's ass was rendered only in 2D, we expected that to jump out of the screen at us but it did not. This is not worth Five dollars for the effort, and this is not 3D. Save your money,look elsewhere, and wait for it to show up in the two dollar bin. That is where this belongs.."
3,Not Jack Black's best work,"With some humorous lines, this lacks from Jack Black's normal shenanigans. Not enough heart or laughter for me to give it more stars."
3,"Less than 1.5 hours long, which is good","While having little to do with Jonathan Swift's 18th century story, Gulliver's Travels is a funny movie (especially if you're drunk). The cast really sell this returd. Jack Black (Shallow Hal, Tenacious D, Kung Fu Panda, School of Rock), Chris O'Dowd (Bridesmaids), Billy Connolly (Billy), Jason Segel (Despicable Me, Forgetting Sarah Marshall), Amanda Peet (Saving Silverman) and Emily Blunt all work to make this film bearable.Recommended to rent, at least.Skizaa.[DW]"
2,Gulliver's Travels,I was bored watching Jack Black's performance in this movie. A waste of money and time. But for $1.99 I'm glad I didn't spend $9 at the movies.
2,Failed my expectations,"Having read the reviews on here, I have seen a wide variety of complaints.What was my biggest complaint? The story itself. The focus is mainly in Lilliput - just a few minutes of the movie was in Brobdingnag, and there was NOTHING of Laputa or the talking horses or anything else. This took away from the story a lot, and trivialized it. Jack Black was funny, but the Lilliput story arc had so much useless filler added to it that it defeated the story - I wish the writing had been more faithful to the book.For a really great visual telling of Gulliver's Travels, try the one with Ted Danson. It was a made-for-TV movie series, but it actually did a pretty darned awesome job with Johnathan Swift's original tale and was creative and fun.Hereit is."
2,Not a good movie,This movie is awful front to back. It's watchable but ultimately an empty experience. Not that the lead role was miscast but because the story just feels forced and most of the actors don't look happy being in the movie. If I wanted to see robot actors I'd watch short circuit.
2,Not a serious movie,"I had hoped this would be a fun remake of Gulliver's Travels, but it's more of a childish version of the story, brimming with pop culture references and corny jokes. Sometimes this was funny, such as Gulliver's claim that Vice President Yoda would take care of his country in his absence. Most of the time, it's B-movie material. I laughed at some of the jokes, but partly out of pity. Unfortunately, Jack Black movies are sometimes a mixed bag, and this was definitely one to pass up. It might be amusing for kids, but even then I'm sure there are better movies."
2,Gulliver's Travels (2 Disc Set with Gulliver's Fun Pack) (2010),"Gulliver's Travels with Jack Black is a waste of money. The Jack Black is wrong actor for that movie or maybe he cannot act anymore. I used to love movies with him but he over played himself, his acting are terrible even my children does not watch him. His guitar hard rock play is annoying and acting is not real life like."
1,Boycott this DVD. Say NO to 20 minutes of FORCED ads & previews,"Shame, shame, shame on Fox for treating its customers like dirt. You CANNOT watch this movie without waiting through nearly 20 MINUTES of ads and previews (no fast forward allowed). And if you accidentally hit the wrong button during that time or if you have to remove the DVD for any reason during the movie than you've got to wait for 20 MINTUES again! This is absurd. The studios are upset because people are looking for alternatives to DVDs. Well what do they expect when they make watching one so painful?"
1,Not a Family Movie --It's lewd and vulgar,"This movie should have been rated PG-13. To rate it PG is very deceptive as it is lewd and vulgar and highly inappropriate for children. Apparently Hollywood thinks everyone has lowered their moral standards in this society. G rated and PG rated movies now have to be prescreened by parents to determine the appropriateness for their own beliefs and values since PG and G movies now contain profanity, vulgarity and lewdness. Normally I check the IMDB parental guide to determine my interest in a movie in terms of profanity, sex, and violence. I didn't check it for this movie not imagining that Gulliver's Travels would be offensive. I should have known with Jack Black in it however."
1,Amazing arrogance.,"The movie was pretty bad but that is not the reason for my total disgust at this product. I rented the DVD from Netflix and found out that in order to watch the movie you have to (are forced to) sit through at least one commercial and several inordinately long trailers. The reasons I say ""forced to watch"" is that not only is the ability to move to the main menu disabled during the commercials and trailers, but (and I have never seen this before) the fast forward was disabled so one is forced to endure the whole commercial block each time the movie is watched.Luckily I only rented the movie and did not buy it. Anyone who does purchase it is going to feel like a chump each time they are forced to sit through the same trailers and commercials in order to watch the movie they paid for. This is a waste of 8 to 10 minutes."
1,Cant skip commercials or previews,In typical fox style they make you watch the previews and the commercials for their new digital copy service. cant fast forward or goto movie menus. Torrent this unless you like a dvd to be in control of your entertainment system with no override. 10 minutes of not being able to fast forward. By far the most I've ever seen.
1,Can't fast forward through trailers,"DO NOT BUY. Everytime you put this disc in you have to watch all of the trailers before you can get to the menu screen. It will allow you to rewind, and watch a trailer again, but not fast forward. So do not make the same mistake I did and rewind on accident or it will be even longer before you can watch the movie."
2,Mr. Black at his worst,"Imagine all the comedies Jack Black is in, from Nacho Libre to School of Rock. Now take scenes from each of them and transpose them onto the plot of the first half of the book Gulliver's Travels, and you have this farce of a comedy. The original book, and the Hallmark movie by Ted Danson, is an exploration of different political systems and what they do to the people living inside them. This movie by Jack Black drops all of that and is basically a comedy outing. The comedy is good, for those who have never seen any of Black's previous movies. If you have, then a lot of it is a rip-off. For example, the various rock and roll scenes with the Lilliputians is just a rehash of School of Rock. And Amanda Peet again shows why she is a good supporting actress, and not much else. Her acting does little to help the movie. Overall, another letdown from Mr. Black."
2,Boring,"If you have never heard of Gulliver, perhaps this movie might be interesting. But who haven't heard of Gulliver? There was nothing unexpected, everybody did their job just fine. That is it! Everybody go home now."
1,If All You Want...,"...is to see another shallow, trite interpretation of a very small section of Johnathan Swift's novel 'Gulliver's Travels', then by all means, watch this and other similar farcical versions. If you want to see a REAL interpretation, I highly recommend you see the miniseries production done several years back starring Ted Danson as Lemuel Gulliver. Search here on Amazon, you'll find the DVD. WARNING: It contains content which might actually make you think, which I assure you, this movie WILL NOT."
1,What is the deal with Jack Black?,"I really don't understand why Jack Black would appeal to anyone. I know I'm not the only one who finds this guy's brand of ""humor"" to be totally annoying. Hollywood hasn't seem to have caught on that most of the rest of the civilized world doesn't really think Jack is as funny as they (or Jack himself) thinks he is. He should be bagging groceries somewhere. Why are they force-feeding this clown to us? King Kong should have just ""squirshed"" Jack when he had the chance."
1,How Shall I Count the Ways I'm So Bad,"Bad:(1.) Highlight of the opening scenes were long takes of stereotypic loser dude and loser dude apartment. Made even more stereotypic because it's typical Black acting.(2.) Second highlight was long take and closeup of changing walk/don't walk traffic signal.(3.) Loser dude mannerisms (i.e. boyerisms) behaviors and language were so predictable and sooo overused that fastforward was too slow.(4.) Filler music to act as substitute for the lack of emotional acting - an overused studio technique to cover low budget poor acting & storytelling.(5.) Really cheap green screen effects. Like two decades ago cheap.(6.) Also the nearly decades old, now passé, fist bump to represent coolness when in fact all it does is shout out ""Out of touch!"" Shown countless times.(7.) ........P.S. See the really well done and classic Beatty & Danson version of Gulliver's Travels."
3,Uncalled for adult action in film not for kids to view. Not funny.,Gullivers Travels Blu-ray 3D was bought to view time a honored title. Why they allowed the prime actor to urinate all over the little people is sickening. That should have been edited out. That completely distroyed the story content. As for 3D action it was fine. Adult humor is one thing but not jammed down young childrens minds.
3,APPRECIATED IT....,"Kind of surprise with the bad rap this movie is getting from the reviewers here. It surely isn't at the top of my list of good movies, but I didn't think it was that bad either. To me it was 'ok'. I mean I do appreciate whenever filmmakers can create these illusions. Either with simple optical illusion, or CGI, or any other way. I DON'T expect every movie to be at least as good as the previous one I saw (nor better). The story was 'ok', a modern, comedy version. I'm not particular fan of Jack Black, but I had a couple of good laughs. Our 6 yol son liked it. Which surprised me. I thought this would not interest him. But he watched it about 6 times now. He doesn't get the jokes, I suppose that are intended for the older audience, but he liked the more down-to-earth kid jokes, (ex. peeing over the castle). His favorite part is the battle with the robot. I thought it was an 'ok' movie to watch with the kids."
2,"Not the very best, but kinda entertaining","To watch it in an airplane is okay, but to have it in the dvd collection rather not.I like Jack Black and I also know that he overdoes it sometimes.Jason Segel is not the very best actor. I kinda do not like him besides in the move Sarah Marshall.What can I say? My review is short...I saw the movie and decided not to have it in my huge dvd collection..."
5,Silly but entertaining movie,"Starring Jack Black, I knew this was going to be a silly movie with some over the top, eye-rolling stupid scenes. However, I was intrigued because it was based on a classic novel. And I don't mind silly movies if that's what I'm expecting. I didn't think I would give it 5 stars though and the reason is this: I laughed SO hard at the doll house scene that my emotions took over and I wanted to cry. That good-for-you unexpected laughter that perks you up for days. I would find myself thinking about that whole scene and just crack up again... at bedtime or doing housework.My advice... don't expect an oscar worthy flick, but sit back and take it for what it is. Like many things in life, you might be surprised once you lower your expectations."
1,Amazing this movie was really made,"Just saw this movie on HBO and it was so bad that I was embarrassed for the cast involved. The ironic part is that the least talented actor in the movie is the star of the movie. This movie really makes Jack Black look like a one trick pony, as he again rehashes his ""30 year old rock fan living in his parent's basement"" routine. Actually come to think of it, that would make a good movie, unfortunately that act is way out of place in this movie and its actually embarrassing for everyone involved and anyone watching"
3,GPL License Violations,"I found the book an excellent guide.The CDs are provided without source code, which makes it impossible to compile hardware drivers (a LAN card in my case) without buying the ""optional"" source disk.No mention is made anywhere on the cover that the kernel code is not included.The conditions to obtain the ""optional"" source CD violate the GPL License even as printed on the page with the order form.To obtain the ""optional"" CD, you must provide an original of the cash register receipt (Amozon has none) and the original form torn from the book.Neither of these restrictions appear in the GPL License, which says (as I understand it) that source code MUST BE provided on request, subject only to a reasonable duplication fee."
2,Red Hat Linux Bible,"I bought this book with great anticipation, however as I started the install it went to frustration. I know nothing of Linux when I started this, and it became a disapointment. The information in the book generaly does not line up with the Linux I installed from the CD that came with it. Also the comands that he talkes about wer not present when I tried them. allot of the setup comands you have to install manualy, I had to do allot of trial and error. His book is also badly organized I find, I found my self fliping to differant sections of the book for the same item. Some of the instructions for setup at the install are in the middle of the book. This may be a good book for when you know what you are doing, but I dont recomend it for the beginner."
3,IT something to start with,"This book was ok it tries to cover to many topics in one shoot but the problem is that it talks very superfically about every subject in order to cover everything. In many cases it tells you about something but doesn't tell you how to set it up. that which i find rather frustrating most of the time i would have to go online and look for the HOW-TO on whatever topic i just read because, what i just read didn't help much. It is a Great book to have so you can see what Linux Has to Offer. If you really want to learn Linux i recommend looking for the HOW-TO's those are great."
3,Like a bible alright,"The title ""Bible"" fits appropriate it talks about a whole bunch of stuff but always half way with many meanings, leaving you wanting for more, if you want a real good Linux book get Sybex press Linux servers 24X7, thats a good book."
1,FIX THE NETWORKING,PLEASE FIX THE NETWORKING. YOUR READERS SUFFER TOO MUCH. OTHERWISE PRODUCE AN UPDATE ON THE IDG BOOKS Website or some other WEBSITE.PLEASE FEEL OUR PAIN
4,Fascinating personal view,"It would be nice to see Robin Fedden's book reissued. Although it's been years since I read it, and it is now difficult to find, even in libraries, I recall a fascinating mix of fact, legend, travelogue, and personal outlook. Lyrical descriptions of the souks of Damascus, the gardens and rich cultural melange found in places like Antioch (once a Christian kingdom ruled by Raymond of Aquitaine), the interior of a bath-house in (I think) Aleppo, the physical beauty of the Jebel Druse people, and, of course, the cedars of Lebanon, combine with snippets of history and what appear to be personal reminiscences. Black and white photographs of architectural monuments, the ruins of Zenobia's Palmyra, and the famous cedars complement the text. This is, believe it or not, a wonderful read, composed in a lush prose by an author with an eye for beauty."
3,great duo= mediocre great hits,"Lots of great hits here, but forgot ""Love Me Baby"" and ""Knight is Rusty Armor"". Come on stop it! Do your homework!"
1,something is missing,"The songs here are fine, but I have a real issue with the title ""ultimate"", what with ""I Don't Want To See You Again"" not included. I can't believe it."
5,Practical instructions,"This book makes the challenging task of building a wonderful family heirloom and breaks it down into easy to understand orderly steps that even a novice can comprehend and easily follow. The full color photography, and well done illusrations leave all other how to books on the shelf."
3,"Good overview of techniques, unusable plans","Although this book has been revised, the text and the photos are dated. The plans provided are printed across the binding makeing them ""uncopyable"" unless you destroy the binding. Printing the plans with a ""matchline"" rather than running them accross the seam would be a significant inprovement and would allow you to scale them on a copy machine. This may be an intentional flaw to get you to purchase the full size plans for $40 each from the publisher.I would not make this the only book I purchased before attempting a canoe or kayak build but it is worth the read and is a descent compliment to more current books on the subject."
4,A good book on the basics of cedar strip canoe building.,"Mr. Gilpatrick clearly explains the basics of how to build strip canoes. His methods and canoe designs are simple and straight forward for even beginning wood workers.All aspects of canoe construction are discussed including materials section, design, assembly, maintenence and repair. There is also a chapter on making a good canoe paddles. Appendixes to the book contain plans for building several styles of canoes and also sources for supplies and information.Mr. Gilpatrick has made everything in this book simple and economical. It is suitable for any first time canoe builder. The only area in which the book is lacking is in some of the more advanced and specialized aspects of canoe building such as special finishes and fibers for certain types of canoes."
3,Somewhat Misleading,"I bought this book thinking that it would tell me how to build a wooden boat. What it actually tells you is how to build a wooden frame that you cover with fiberglass inside and out. The photos look like they are of wooden boats, but they're actually fiberglass boats with clear fiberglass that allows you to see the wooden inner structure. If I wanted a fiberglass boat I would build the boat with thin plywood or even balsa, cover it with several layers of fiberglass, and be done with it. Also, I was disappointed to find that the cedar strips aren't available commercially - you have to cut them yourself, and form the edge with a router. It makes for a very pretty boat, but one that is built in about the most time consuming fashion I can imagine. That said, if this is the kind of boat you want to build I don't think you could possibly find a better or more complete book on the subject than this one."
2,Wonderful content. Disappointing publishing.,"Fifteen years ago my kids and I used the first edition of ""Building a Strip Canoe"" to make a ""puddle duck."" We were not great woodworkers but the boat is wonderful. We get lots of appreciative comments to this day. We've paddled it in the Rockies and the Chesapeake Bay. It has been bashed in and repaired and is a family icon.I have long since lost my copy of the 1st edition so I was excited to see a new, 2nd edition of ""Building a Strip Canoe"" here on Amazon. I bought it hot of the press and found . . . the typeface, ink, and glossy pages conspire to make it very hard to read, to the extent that it is unusable.In it's favor: the second edition includes full-sized plans for the canoes. The plans in the first edition have to be blown up (not hard on modern copiers.) Also the binding appears better now. My first edition fell apart -- I re-bound it with a simple spiral binding.I returned the new 2nd edition and intend to buy a used 1st edition."
4,build a canoe,I though it to be an excellent diy book great detail and several canoes to select from. Was a little to wordie.
5,Fiberglassing Pitfall,"I built an 18.5 ft White Guide model and am in the middle of building a 17 ft version of the same canoe. The first boat turned out well but the fiberglass is cloudy in spots. I layed up the second boat and the same thing occurred. It wasn't until sanding it down to the wood and relaminating (with the help of my brother) that I discovered the cause. Micro-bubbles in the resin were causing the clouding. It can occur when you reuse resin that you squeegee off the boat, but not always. The second boat is absolutely beautiful and will definitely be a head turner. But even the first canoe, with a less than perfect layup, has engendered many compliments on the few outings that I've taken. One more thing, work with a partner when fiberglassing and under-catalize the resin. It will give you more time to work and you'll end up with a better product."
5,Good instructions for novices,"Overall, the book provides clear instructions on building the canoes. For a novice builder like myself, clear instructions are critical. My only grouch is in the binding quality. I've had the book for over 6 months, and haven't touched it for the past five months.. until recently. Was pretty disappointed to find that the binding had failed in a few places, causing a third of the pages to come free. Other than that, I'd recommend the book."
5,Great Garland Bag!,"This is a great storage bag for decorated garland that you don't want to stuff into a small container. This bag is lightweight but very sturdy. I was able to fit two lighted and decorated 9 foot garland in this bag. My garland is decorated with flowers, beaded fruit,etc. so is bulker than some undecorated garland. I tried to put three but the zipper started to split apart. Fortunately, after removing the third garland, the zipper worked fine. I would definitely recommend this bag."
4,"Blue, yep, but...","It's a nice looking tie and a cheap one too! But my only concern is that, the color seemed a little darker than what is shown in the picture. It's not royal blue more close to navy blue in my opinion. Buuuut...it'll work for now."
4,Wilderness Champion,This book was in great condition for a used book. The delivery time was fast for US mail too.
2,The Constant Reader gets hosed by Publisher again,I agree with all the other laudatory comments made on the two books in this series but would like to express my profound displeasure at the fact that a conclusion to the story will not be forthcoming.We all paid for these books with the expectation of a completed story arc being available at some point in time. But the publisher apparently feels no responsibility to complete the beginning and middle for which they gladly took our money.My advise is to not buy this either of the books in this series as you will only get a partially completed product.
2,Just OK,Not easy to get through. I like scifi but this was a little to out there for me. Not my kind of scifi thats all.
3,Good but not essential.,"The nearly eleven minutes of Yes' cover of Paul Simon's America make this disc worth purchasing. This cut presents the classic Yes line-up with Anderson, Bruford, Howe, Squire and Wakeman. It is just an outstanding gem and this is by far Yes' best version of this tune. The rest of the material is taken from their first two albums with original guitarist Peter Banks and keyboardist Tony Kaye. Where Kaye performs admirably, Banks' playing is not up to the task. The compositions are not up to the standard of their other 70's work as they are often underdeveloped and lyrically unsophisticated. Still the interplay between Bruford, Squire and Kaye is impressive even then. Collect The Yes Album, Fragile, Close to the Edge, Tales of Topographic Oceans, Relayer and Going for the One before opting for this one...Simon"
2,i LOVE THE MUSIC ON HERE...,"but the master tape on some of the old tracks is seriously out of phase. ""Survival"" is almost unlistenable. It sounds like it was run thru a phase shifter. I've never heard anyone else mention even though it's so glaring. The first two YES albums sound fine it's just this compilation. The original LP sounded like this and also the first CD transfer. And now the remaster. Why didn't they just go back to the original masters for the first two albums and add them back to the compilation? ""America"" sounds fine though..."
2,"Yes Are A Great Band, But This Is Not Them At Their Best.","Yesterdays brings together songs from Yes, their self titled debut and 2nd album Time And A Word, plus a 10 minute version of Paul Simon's America.To be honest their cover of America dose'nt seem to work and not enough tracks have stood the test of 40 odd years.The better songs are Time And A Word and particularly Survival, the harmonies are excellent, basically everything comes together.Yes fans who want all their recordings will want this one, but not everyone else."
3,Poor choices,"This is supposed to be a compilation of the pre-Yes Album Yes, and as such, it's not very consistent. Reviewers all love America, but that is a pre-Close tot the edge song and should not have been included on this album. 'Something's coming' would have been a better choice. Also, some songs on the first two albums already showed signs of the Yes ambition to capture that 'grandeur' or cinematic feel they were able to produce later. I mean songs like No Opportunity Necessary, Harold Land and The Prophet. By the way, Yesterdays was released to fill a gap - there was to be no regular Yes album in 1975."
1,"TERRIBLE Product, easily shatters into small sharp bits","DO NOT buy this product if your dog is large or has strong jaws.I am always searching for good chewing toys for our 1 year old Great Dane. (Note that she is in the lower 10th size percentile for Great Danes, so she's not even that monstrously large or strong.)She was able to crush this bone into hundreds of tiny sharp pieces within minutes of chewing.Also, the product was very greasy and left grease stains on her dog bed.I had purchased three, but I threw the other two away with the collection of splinters from the first."
3,dog loves em,My dog loves the bones but they seem to splinter more than some other bones. Just have to keep an eye out
5,Taking back classroom.,"Great book, very useful information. I was able to implement some of the suggestions in my first class this fall. book arrived quickly."
3,6 per case??,"I like the product just fine, but assumed that I was going to be receiving 6 containers and not one. The product description said 6 per case, so I assumed this would be a case of 6 20ct. containers. It was only 1. Just FYI."
1,Don't buy,Arrived late and dried out. I ended up having to throw the wipes away b/c they were no good. What a waste of money.
2,Just Not Worth It,"Upon arrival the wipes were barely moist - not useful at all for their purpose. I dampened one anyway to test the product on my leather car interior - not impressed. Seems like a moist, damp cloth would have yielded the same results. Amazon was very good about the return."
4,It does the job,"I have been using this product on my leather chair and my car, it keeps the leather clean leaving a nice luster"
2,didnt work on my interior,i have a 2012 gti with black leather interior.i have had great experience in the past with armorall wipes on a brown leather interor. however this product left streaks on my black interior. armorall gave me a refund when i complained
5,Armor All Leather Wipes,"We have all leather furniture in our living room - this product is the most effective of all ""leather wipe"" products we have used in the past. No strong odor a plus!"
3,Almost great,"For the most part, these are fantastic -- good fit, comfortable, good material, and MOSTLY well-made. I say mostly; while the seams appear to be sturdily stitched, the button attachment on the top leaves wanting. A button came off after only three or four wearings, and further inspection showed that two of the other three were starting to unravel. I ended up resewing or at least adding a few extra turns of thread on all four. I would almost recommend this before even wearing, if the button stitching on mine is standard. Would be a four-star otherwise.Another note, the bottoms are on the long side, as might be expected of this kind of one-size-fits-many garment. Not a problem, but something to be aware of -- unless you're particularly tall or long-limbed, you may need to hem them up."
2,Report on the Izod solid sleepwear item I received and had to return.,unfortunately through no fault of the supplier (Bealls) it was necessary for me to return the item. it just was not what I really wanted though the quality was excellent.I returned via Parcel Post a week ago and am hoping to get a full refund back.
4,Grandkids are amatuer magicians,"Hey, my grandboys really had fun with this. I wouldn't buy this for an adult or anyone really serious about magic. Nicely made."
5,A Thoroughly Enjoyable Read!,"I had read much about the Civil War and much about Joshua Chamberlain. I though I knew the man and his life but Thomas Oliver taught me a lesson or two. Within his clear and precise prose he has brought a book which is a very pleasant experience. Oliver's style lends itself to ""just turn another page"" and before you know it you're far into it and unwilling to put it down. I read it in one evening. Chamberlain's life is a true American story: The sheltered professor who became a soldier and ultimately a hero at Gettysburg. A Medal of Honor winner, promoted to general and selected by Grant to accept the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia. The book is full of wonderful details, both historical and personal, and is guaranteed to keep your interest. I learned, for instance, that Chamberlain's medal was awarded decades after the fact and was actually mailed to him. Thanks, Mr. Oliver, for a fine historical effort and bring us more!"
1,Gets All Gummy,"Blah, I really didn't like this stuff. It got all gummy in my hand. It dries out really fast. No time to enjoy what my hand was doing, kept having to reapply the stuff. Yeah it's thick, doesn't fall off your palm. But darn it, I got all stuck to me, it hurt. Then putting this stuff inside a personal device to make my best friend down south happy, whoa it just got all dried out there too. Worse even, because with my hand, I could roll it off. With those sleeves and tubes, it kind of gets stuck inside. That hurts man.So for self enjoyment, pass on this stuff. It just turns into a sticky gluey gummy mess. And it doesn't taste too good either. Yeah, don't ask me how I know. It just doesn't. Not a JO cream at all, go find something else."
2,Too bulky and expensive,"The case is made of cheap material.It is bulky and uncomfortable to carry and it appears not to be made specifically for the Sony Alpha.It does fit the Alpha easily, with lots of extra space. But the point is that the extra space is not enough to fit an extra lens.So my suggestion is to either1) get a bigger bag with space for an extra lensor2) get something smaller, easier to carry, if you want to carry only one lens."
5,Air Force One,"My grandson likes assembling snap together air plane models. They are easy to put together and look realistic. For youngsters interested in aviation, it's a great toy, although the cost seems a little high."
3,Great organizer,I bought this case a couple years back. It served me well and I really liked the features. It had to be retired though when the handle came apart. :-( I think some superglue might fix it.
4,Great Beach Book!,"A lighthearted read! This book is great for one of those relaxing no-thinking days. The characters are refreshing and although at times the storyline is unlikely, it is entertaining to read. If you like rich characters, then you will enjoy this book. As for the comparison of being like the television show ""friends"" I can see some resemblance, in the sense of absolutely ridiculous situations that the characters seem to put themselves in. Enjoy and I would read another book from this author."
3,friends or not?,"This book wasn't the best in bunch but it was enjoyable.Some parts had me cracking up =), while others left me wanting to put the book down.It was like that the whole way through. It would get good then it would get boring and I'd stop."
3,Not that great,"I own this camera, it's my first digital camera and I've had it for a few years now. It's an alright camera. The shutter is slow. It's horrible in dim situations. But it's pretty good outside, with still subjects. I'm actually looking for another camera. I'm about to go on a trip to Saint Lucia, and I want something reliable that will bring back some great pictures."
2,subpar,"so the image conscious marketing geniuses wanted to make SR more grungy and less glam? fair enough, but SR wasn't very glam to begin with, and with S to the G, they had already made all the transition they needed. SubHmn Race is just grunge for the sake of grunge, SR's distinctive style is lost, the songs are non-descript, and Baz' vox are restrained, sounding more like a Pantera imitator than the guy who was giving Axl a run for his $ in the range dept."
5,"If you think Skid Row is a ""Glam"" or ""Hair Band"", then you have never heard this...","Nothing like the self titled ""Skid Row"" release of 1989 and ""Subhuman Race"" is even harder than the 1991 album ""Slave to the Grind"". It is really too bad that the record labels were dumping ""grunge"" and ""alternative"" hype on the public in the `90s so everyone basically ignored this album thinking it was just another ""hair band"" release. If it was actually given a chance, this may have actually saved Skid Row from virtual obscurity today.In my humble opinion, this album could go toe to toe with any of Metallica's releases in recent times and even thrash them out of the water while reminding Metallica that the term ""Heavy Metal"" starts with the word ""HEAVY"".In my opinion, after this album; it is truly unfair to continue to describe Skid Row using bands such as Warrant, Mr. Big, Poison or other `80s hair or glam bands as references."
3,Skid Row - 'Subhuman Race' (Atlantic),"I've always been sort of a fair-weather fan of Skid Row.As this is their third effort,I've always liked 'Slave To The Grind' better than this or their self-titled debut.In all fairness,'Subhuman Race' just might satisfy the really big-time Skid Row fans.Some of the tracks that I thought were decent include ""Firesign"",""My Enemy"",the title cut ""Subhuman Race"",""Bonehead"" and ""Eileen""(perhaps the disc's best cut).Overall,a decent hair metal band CD."
3,"Subhuman = Subpar, for Skid Row","Some think this is Skid Row's best work, perhaps in an attempt to go against the grain or to avoid anointing their more famous albums, Skid Row and Slave to the Grind, as their best. But this is deluded nonsense. Neither as catchy as their self-titled debut, nor as aggressive as the stellar Slave, Subhuman Race comes off as a band that has lost its identity, and is trying to compete with more recently successful bands like Pantera by taking the aggression in a new, clearly thrash influenced direction.But, for the most part, it doesn't come across as an incredibly successful effort. Most of the tracks lack the character that was to be found, in abundance, on Slave and the highlights of the album are barely equal to the filler on that, the most outstanding of Skid Row's efforts.There are some quality tracks, which salvage the album for the hardcore fan (""Remains to be Seen"" in particular), though they're just not up to Skid Row's best, overall."
2,Skid Row- Great Departure,"This album is nothing like Slave to the Grind, or Skid Row's Self titled debut. It's much more aggressive, louder, and I had a hard time getting into it. I can't get into this album."
2,deceiving........,"Deceiving, a little too many changes in their sound.....perhaps too far-fetched.....a couple of good songs, though......'Firesign', 'Beat yourself blind', but nothing really talented....."
2,Not very good,"After reading all of the stellar reviews, I bought this CD used. I expected much more since Skid Row's debut & Slave To The Grind were great records. This record was released in the mid 90's, and it's obvious the band wasn't sure which direction to go in. This is not a metal record as some of the other reviewers have claimed. One song was punk. Only 2 tracks were melody based, and sounded good. There was a lot of great playing on this record, but no great songwriting. Several of the pieces used odd time signatures ala progressive rock. Many of the pieces tried to borrow from the then hot alternative rock scene. I could here Alice In Chains types of guitar riffs, and big diminished chords ala STP. Boz's singing was more of a raspy hurl then actual singing. Nowhere on this record is a great sustained note like in ""18 and Life"". Overall, I am super disappointed, and plan to put this back up for sale."
4,"Without Sebastian, I would have given it two stars.","I was dissappointed by this album, with the other Skid Row albums being so AWESOME I expected better. It is a good album with some good songs, but without Sebastian Bach's awesome vocals I don't think I would have liked it.If know you like skid row this is worth a listen, if you are new to skid row then I would reccomend their first, self titled album."
5,It really does matter what you believe!,"Shana has tapped into some very important exercises, that I haven't seen in any of the other spiritual/self-help type of books. When I did the exercise to write down what you believe, for the first time I realized that I wasn't sure. After days of frustration and searching, I figured out what it was that I beleive and everything else came easier to me. I was more confident and felt like I could move forward. The book is much more than 30 days to a more spiritual life, it is an enjoyable read. I felt like I found a new friend who believed in me. Wonderful book!"
5,How to create beautiful things from everyday materials,"Cherie Lynn, a professional and published art teacher for grades K-8 with over 20 years' experience, Art On A Shoestring is a DVD that teaches young people how to create beautiful things from everyday materials around the house, such as buttons, string, and cardboard.

A great DVD for educational use rainy day fun. 186 minutes, color."
5,"""Natural"" Born Bug Killer",This stuff works. It has even helped me curb our common black widow infestations and those things are very tough to get rid off. Everything else we have sprayed near or on usually won't come back in a year. It's insect and arachnid death in a convenient spray bottle.
1,"""the beautifully illustrated book""","I must say that this book does has a lot of pictures in it showing the aspects of Shakespear's world and plays. They are very good and intertaining but I must warn you that the book has a whole chapter with illustrations (in detail)of people having sex. The book is probably very good if you like reading text books, and don't mind these pictures, but I was just too grossed out. If you are teaching Lit in college and/or studying Shakespeare, this is probably the book that you should use, but you should flip through the book first (i.e: library, book store) to see if that is what you want on your book shelves."
3,Not worth it. Definitely overpriced.,"Too simplistic. Perhaps good for newbies. But anyway thereare better books on FFT, e.g. Brigham. This one is not forprofessionals! You've been warned. For beginners I would recommend books by Zonst. They are much more to the point.And cheaper! Thanks god I didn't buy it myself!"
5,"It's short, it's Christian, it's prayer; it's wonderful","This set of prayers is a daily offering of psalms, readings, and other prayers to help direct one towards God.I have the four-volume set of the liturgy, but find those volumes are difficult to carry with me when I am traveling, or when I am visiting a place where I will have some time to pray and just want to carry a smaller book in my pocket. What you do lose is the complete set of prayers (such as the Office of Readings and various holy days), and you do have to use more place-markers, but it's a wonderful companion that I'd rather not be without."
1,Don't do it,"This book is still being actively marketed by its publishing company, Prentice-Hall. However, you will find that when you go to download the images for this book, which, by the way, are instrumental to its use, that the page to which you were directed to in order to get them is gone. Go then to the publisher; you will find them there; download them and ATTEMPT to extract them. You will be informed that the file is corrupt, and cannot be expanded. It is nothing short of criminal that this book is actually still being sold but is NOT being supported. Unless you have more money you know what to do with, do not buy this book. To sell an unsupported book is show as much disregard and disrespect for the people spending their hard-earned money on it as is possible to show."
2,Heats Up Too Quickly!,"Don't be fooled buy imitators! This is one of them. I have purchased other items from Adam & Eve Co. that were fine. Not this! It is nothing more than a cheapo Hitachi. The vibration itself is fine, but after 15/20 minutes the entire thing starts to heat up. The metal ring wear the neck that holds the head gets really hot. Even after it is turned off it stays warm for lke a 25 minutes. Save for money, go for the gold- Hitachi"
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I thought I'd try this product to compare to the Hitachi Magic Wand, which is what I normally use. Although the design is nearly identical, this version is not UL-listed and actually shocked me the first time I tried to use it. I'll be going back to the Hitachi brand now."
2,Just get the hitachi,The quality doesn't begin to compare to the hitachi. It does the job but doesn't hold up. The first one progressively got louder and louder with each use. After a couple weeks it just stopped working. The replacement took slightly longer to die but didn't make it a full 3 months. The hitachi is significantly quieter and is still going after 1.5 years. Sure its a little more expensive but well worth the it.
3,Not quite the magic wand,"Works pretty good. looks nice. But it isn't comparable to the original. Get the Hitachi Magic Wand instead, it's worth the extra price."
2,It Broke after 3 uses - blue sparks -very disappointed ...,I am so disappointed. I only used this 3 times and it made blue sparksand shorted out and wont work now. i could have been shocked! I was so looking forward to finally owning a plug in unit. :( I have to admit I havent tried to see if I can get a refund yet cuz it just happened...but i was really let down.. :(Adam & Eve Magic Massager
1,Outright DANGEROUS!,"The biggest complaint we have is that after a while the wimpy cord they use will fray and then short out. We had two of these and BOTH cords near the strain relief at the body cracked and shorted with a spray of molten copper. Not good. Spend a bit more and get the Hitachi. We had great service with that and tried to save a little getting this POS. Run the other way, folks!"
1,DEFECTIVE & GENERIC,"Thought I was catching a GREAT deal for $18. Boy were we wrong. Item received noticed it didn't look like my previous packaging. Ok.....maybe it's just me, open it, its light weight, the REAL one is heavy because there's a REAL motor in it! I plug in to test it, IT DIDN'T TURN ON. =[ Boy am i pissed. I popped the cord (on the REAL massage wand) last week and was looking for a quick fix and a discount. I paid $80 at the shop so I came on here for a deal. I will be right back at the shop tomorrow."
1,Not the same item as the one that Adam & Eve sells.,"I was hoping that I was getting a good deal, but found out that previous reviews were true. This is a cheaper knock off of the Adam & Eve Massager that you can get from the adam & eve site. The vibrations are no where near powerful enough and mine happened to make a wierd noise. Definitely do not buy this."
2,Short....electricity life?,"So, I bought this thinking it would be just what I was looking for. While it was okay when it worked, I used it maybe about 10 times, and it died. This thing runs on electricity, and ran out like the batteries died. Sadly, it died right before I climaxed. Unnnnlucky."
1,PIECE OF CRAP,I purchased this product and it STOPPED WORKING AFTER 30 MINUTES of use on the first two days I had it.It was replaced and the second LASTED ALL OF 40 MIN. AND STOPPED WORKING.The COMPANY NOW REFUSES to replace it or exchange.LOUSY COMPANY and even worse product made in China.
4,"Science meets sci-fi, and not a human in sight!","This book is expertly written and researched. I bought it for the specific chapter on dental health, as there are few sources of information for those of us who believe the teeth can be healed without endless root canals. The information is absolutely riveting and should be photocopied and placed in every dental surgery in the country!However, the rest of the book is tedious in its determination to present a scientific basis for energy medicine. He spouts endlessly about clever machines which do the same job as any competent homeopath or kinesiologist. The human touch is just not there. This is a book to glorify 'New Age-friendly' scientists, rather than to aid therapists, in my opinion. If you are a therapist and have the Donna Eden 'Energy Medicine', you can easily do without this book."
5,hot !!!!!,"I bought this for my hubby... Halloween night he looked awesome, everyone loved the costume:))"
3,fight on!,"Great costume! The white dress fits a little awkward and the arm cuffs a little big, but I loved this costume. It's definitely the right price and looks great on."
5,Nice costume,"I bought the medium size and it worked really well for me (5' 10"" 180 lbs). The quality was really good and it was a hit at the party I went to. I did have to iron the slats to take out the wrinkles. I just used the iron on the back side."
3,Greek Costume,"Not the best made costume for the price I had to pay, but it was all I could find. It did the job, but you can tell that it is made of cheap plastic."
5,excellent choice,"eventhoug it's a little larger than I expected, but it's really a nice custom to wear. Just as it is shown in the picture."
3,"Pretty, but big","I like this watch, though, at first I was a bit taken aback by its size. The watch itself measures 1.5 x 7/8 inches (at its widest) - which looks huge on my tiny wrist. It's very stylish, though, and I get lots of compliments on it.One other thing that I have difficulty with is the face. It's silvery-white, and the numerals are silver. The hands are silver as well. That means that in certain light situations, and with my older-person eyesight, I have trouble reading it."
5,Now Montserrat is on My Mind too....,"This is a collection of stories about Montserrat, a tiny Eastern Caribbean island. It was beautiful. I laughed out loud, I cried flowing tears, I read it cover to cover in one sitting, and as a Montserratian I wanted so badly to go Home. I'm now trying to plan a trip....The stories are well written and I think they will be enjoyed by anyone who reads this book."
4,Switched the padlock and all is fine.,"This was very easy to attach and has served it's purpose of keeping the kids out.I did not care for the lock it arrived with. (It is not the one pictured but a silver lock consisting of three rows of numbers.) To begin with it was very hard to change the combination (you rotate it a quarter turn, reset, and it's supposed to work). After trying to change it, a random number was somehow set which I was able to trouble shoot by systematically going through numbers while watching TV one night.All was fine until my teen realized the code could systematically be ""busted"" and presented me with the lock one evening! So, we've moved to using a key lock and now all is running smoothly.So, if you have determined kids, I recommend this product but take the time to purchase a simple key lock to use instead."
5,Very effective,"My elderly mother is experiencing memory function problems and stays up all night doing odd things. We purchased this product to prevent her from raiding the refrigerator late at night and in the wee hours of the morning. She takes food and dairy products out and stashes them in various places causing them to spoil or rot and she will then try to eat them or carry them around with her. The product works great. Even with a significant amount of force from a strong arm, the door cannot be opened. We are very pleased with this purchase which shipped very promptly through Amazon."
5,These are AWESOME,I have a mentally ill daughter that has no self control. I had to install these on my fridge and freezers to keep her out or I literally would not have been able to afford to feed my other kids. They are strong and do the job! Easy to install too! They are also good for little ones! Much better than the childproofing ones. I have had these now for 3 years.
2,Cute monkey. However...,"This is certainly a cute monkey. That said, I agree with a previous reviewer who said that the music box portion is awful. If you are going to sell a musical stuffed monkey, please make sure it is musical!"
5,Incredible Album,"The Sixteen are a very talented group of singers and this is indeed a very peaceful, inspirational album."
3,Relaxing,"Nice selection, but it was not as ""relaxing"" as I would have expected. It would be good for ambiance music, though."
3,Diaper not so good,"For a long time I've been contemplating ordering these diapers for my night time use. I have no control over my lower portion of my body at night and no diaper has ever come close to holding me until the morning. This diaper is no exception. It leaks after 2 full wettings and I never wake up after just 1. There is no good smell guard so anyone can smell when I accidentally poop myself. The plastic is extremely crinkly which isn't necessarily bad, but it doesn't help the leaking process, liquid actually comes through the plastic. The worst of all, is the tapes. They don't stick and stay at all. They always fall leading to more leaks because it comes out of place. I would not recommend this diaper for anyone who needs it!"
3,"Good Tunes, Bad Tunes.","What can one expect from a tribute album? Good bands and better interpretations hopefully. ""Sheryl Crow"" and ""Stone Temple Pilots"" both do a fair job, but nothing too amazing. ""4 Non Blondes"" and ""Duran Duran"" are suprisingly good. My favorite is from ""Rollins Band"". Some might hate it, but I think it's the strongest cover. Of course ""Robert Plant"" with ""Tori Amos"" is pretty good too. The others are hit and miss. This is a decent cd overall, but the big problem, like with most tributes, is that it just makes you want to listen to the far superior originals, like I will now."
2,Wrong Band for a Tribute,"The entire idea of a LZ tribute is misguided. Led Zeppelin weren't songwriters per se - their magic lay in their interpretation of what was on the written page. Thus the only ""good"" items here are the ones that sound somewhat like the original Zep numbers. I'm not a Hootie fan, but they do a good job on ""Hey Hey What Can I Do"", and STP finally mimics a band on purpose with ""Dancing Days"". If you find it for a buck somewhere, you may want to pick it up, otherwise, don't bother."
2,No.,"I have to get this out of my system. Half of this album is interesting. Half is OK. Half SUCKS. D'yer Maker is my favorite song, and Sheryl Crow certainly didn't do justice to it. The Stone Temple Pilots did an OK half accoustic Dancing Days, and Hootie and the Blowfish's version of Hey, Hey What Can I do does justice to a hard-to-obtain song. Tori Amos and Robert Plant on Down By the Seaside is interesting and gets a star itself, but many of the other bands suck and suck even more trying to tribute to Led Zeppelin. If you are a die-hard ZepHead you might want to by this to respect LZ more, or for a few good songs, Hey, Hey..., Down By the Seaside... But there is too much to be ashamed here about. As Artus Urbe (NHL goalie) pointed out to a S.F. Bay Area radio station, Led Zeppelin cannot be imitated. (he called up one morning and started saying how he was ticked about all the Zep remakes and wanted some reasl LZ!)"
2,the cover versions sounding the same like the original one,"yes in fact these commercial various artists are sounding the same like the original one (the way they are imitating Robert plant voice so much!) then I would like tobuy the original albums of ZEP than buying this cover version songs.My opinion of another cd: the tribute to DEEP PURPLE cd is much better than this one, because the rap, funky, soul musicians on the tribute to deep purpleaccording to new york, did not imitate the deep purple original sound. They have improvised the DP songs into New yorker black music style.But this Zeppelin cover version songs are boaring and unspectacular,.........most of the various artists are copying the PLANT voice so much. need I say more?"
3,A few gems scattered around,"There are a few bummers here,like Henry Rollins slaughtering ""Four Sticks""with his patented scream-don't sing method,but there is the o so lovely moans and come hither cooing of Sheryl Crow on ""D'yer Maker"" which make for interesting listening.Even the normally lousy Hootie and the Blowfish manage to lay down a good rendition of ""Hey hey what can i do"".""Tangerine"" also comes off fine courtesy of Big Head Todd and the Monsters.Robert Plant's duet with Tori Amos on ""Down by the seaside"" may be a bit long and strained but Tori never sounded better.Her girlish whine is a delight.STP's version of ""Dancing Days""is very likable with its minimal approach,but may be too laid back for some.All in all a good album as far as tribute albums go,but then again considering how great Zep's music is it would take utterly untalented hacks to not remake at least a halfway decent cover version.Buy this one if you spot a used copy."
2,"1 star for Robert, 1 star for Tori","There's only one interesting thing about this thing, the Tori and Robert duet. This has really made me realize that one shouldn't bother remaking anything from Zeppelin. When Zeppelin has broken all the boundaries and all that, there's nothing else to do with their stuff that anyone wants to hear. When you try to repaint a master work, it comes out looking like some desperate jerk with finger paints."
2,A Waste of Money,This could have been a great C.D./tape if they had gotten better bands to remake the songs. The only good band on the C.D. was the Stone Temple Pilots. Most of the others were bands I've never even heard of.
2,Not for Led Zeppelin fans,"The problem with this CD is that some bands (or artists) don't have personality enough to give something else to the original songs. They played the songs the same way Led Zeppelin did, in some cases the vocals tried to sing like Robert Plant. The first track is ridiculous. It was disgusting when they tried to make Samba (?!?) in the middle of the music. Believe me, I know what Samba is. There are good performances like the songs played by Hootie and the Blowfish, Helmet and Rollins Band. They didn't run away from their style. Finally, what to say about a tribute to Led Zeppelin where even Robert Plant was disapponting?"
1,Don't bother,"Total waste of money. I'm a big Zep fan and I usally enjoy tribute albums. This one is just awful. The covers are not creative, bring no new insights of interpretation. It not even an enjoyable listen...."
4,A very solid tribute CD. I was definately surprised.,"I lost this CD a few months ago, but I used to listen to it occasionally. Most of the songs on this disc are very good, but for my money, the best track on here is ""Thank You"" performed by Duran Duran. I really don't like Duran Duran so I was pretty surprised by that. Most of the other tracks are good too. If you like Zep, this is definately a disc to check out if you are looking for something different."
2,The cover version songs sounding the same like the original,"yes in fact these commercial various artists are sounding the same like the original one (the way they are imitating Robert plant voice so much!) then I would like to buy the original albums of ZEP than buying this cover version songs.My opinion of another cd: the tribute to DEEP PURPLE cd is much better than this one, because the rap, funky, soul musicians on the tribute to deep purple according to new york, did not imitate the deep purple original sound. They have improvised the DP songs into New yorker black music style.But this Zeppelin cover version songs are boaring and unspectacular,.........most of the various artists are copying the PLANT voice so much. need I say more?"
1,Better album title: Zeppelin Violated,"I wouldn't mind a tribute album to Zeppelin as long as it had some decent bands playing on it. None of these groups/artists are qualified and all of the songs end up sounding like crap. STP isn't too bad, but Hootie and the Blowfish? 4 Non Blondes? Give me a break! Burn this CD if you have it."
1,what's the point?,song covers have to overcome the prejudice of the original recording artists' fans. this collection fails almost totally.
1,This Is the WORST tribute I have ever herd,This has been a joke from the begining the bands that tried effortlessly on these songs must have been Drunk or high on drugs they all did the worst renditions I've ever herd. This is the type of thing where you give this as a mercy present when not knowing what else to give. Truly I am a fan of OLDER S T P music but Come on . And Giving this album a single star is beyond generous But I can't give them no stars because it won't let me
1,This CD/tape is a waste of hard earned money,"I think it sucks when no name band, such as 4 Non Blondes and others try to compare themselves to the best. It's an insult to me and other Zeppein fans across the world. I say if somethings not broken, don't fix it. Nobody will ever come close to being as revelutionary as Led Zeppelin at any time in their musical careers. I find it a tribute to the late, great John Bonham that Plant, Page, and Jones called it quits when they did. Its a testament to the loyalty they showed each and every day. Has anybody stopped to think why Led Zeppelin hasn't made any new albums, I wonder. In my eyes Led Zeppelin will always be the greatest rock band ever, even if they never play another note again."
2,Just Download the Good Ones,"Sheryl Crow's Dyer Maker and Hootie and the Blowfish's Hey Hey What Can I Do are the only worthy songs that appear on this record. Please, I urge you to ignore these alternative yappers and just download these two songs from the internet. Note: Wouldn't ""Alternative Yappers"" be a great name for a punk band"
2,cover version songs are imitating the original,"well this one is not good, the cover version songs from sheryl crow, temple pilots, duran duran. what are these all?ZEP was abused by the fans and then they are enthusiastic to copy their original albums.I dont even care about that, cause I m not a huge ZEP fan. But these various artists are too much over acting. Certainly there are many more better rock n roll bands than ZEPPELIN."
4,Not bad...,"I happen to be a hardcore ZepHead who actually likes this collection. It's a nice departure from the ""clones"", and I like the interpretations. So it's not Zeppelin. So what?"
4,Open Your Minds,"The problem with everyone else's review is that they went into this CD expecting too much. You should know before you ever listened to it that it wouldn't be like true Zeppelin, but that's not the point. It is the artist featured putting their own self into a Zeppelin song. I happen to LOVE Sheryl Crow's Rendition of D'yer Mak'er, which is my favorite song of all time. She does a great job, in my opinion, just as good as Zeppelin, but in her own way. And if you buy the album just for Plant and Amos doing Down by the Seaside you got your money's worth. There is no song on this album I do not like, there are some I can see where others wouldn't, but the album is not a waste of money, as long as you don't try to look at it like you are buying a Led Zeppelin album. It is it's own album, seperate from Zeppelin as a whole."
3,Some of the songs are great,But some of the artists don't do Zeppelin justice. Some of the greats shouldn't be touched or done by another group.
3,Ehh,"I remembered the STP cover and wanted it. But I couldn't find any sample versions of the songs on the web. So I just bought it. Liked lots of the other artists and thought it would be good. Probably wouldn't buy it again, but it's ok."
2,uninteresting,"I'm always open for hearing band's takes on songs by other people. Sadly, there really isn't much to say about this album. There's nothing too original, which is sometimes okay, but I think there's a lack of energy or something... There's nothing to listen to this album twice over. But of course, this is all my opinion. If you are a fan of any of these bands then maybe this will be more interesting than it is to me. The bands did all choose good songs to cover, so that's a positive thing."
3,Pleasant. Fine. But nothing special.,"I'm a fan of the genre (tribute albums) and this is definitely a middle-of-the-road achievement in that vein. Nothing radical or challenging or fantastic in any way, but nothing truly terribly, and several tracks are at least quite good, indeed. Not nearly as reflective as Deadicate or as diverse as Sharin in the Groove, but a good listen and probably worth at least the used price."
2,STP - Maybe. Sheryl Crow? Duran Duran? What IS this?,This album just does not do Zeppelin justice. I don't think anyone would expect modern rock to completely recreate the sounds of Paige's flaming guitar work or Plant's wailing vocals - but we can expect more than this. Most of these remakes are 2nd rate b-sides that don't really deserve to pay homage to one of the most original and inspiring bands of all-time. Quality of music on this album is sacrificed for variety of groups.*Nothing against Sheryl or Duran Duran - This just isn't their thing
2,Why Is Sheryl Crow in this?,"This album/cd is probably worth a 3.5 to 4 just because there are some decent artists included. But my question is, why is Sheryl Crow in this? Her version of D'yer Maker alone made me sell this to my boss(I HATE MY BOSS!)"
2,Should be renamed Incredibly simple 5 minute mysteries,"I'm a big fan of mind puzzles, and especially of the ""whodunnit"" type, often titled with a variation of ""minute mysteries"". They're particularly good if I have to read them at least twice to ascertain the subtle clues to solve the case and then proclaim to myself, ""clever!"".Thus, when I saw the title of this book, I figured I was in for a good challenge. Not so. In fact, this book was very disappointing. Although Weber did a good job of constructing the backstories, the ""mysteries"" themselves required little if any thought and basically the solution was apparent through common sense."
1,the same book with another tittle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"only in very small letters, INSIDE the book, they say it is ""THE ARMCHAIR DETECTIVE 2"". Since I allready had that book, now i have two copies of the same book. VERY BAD PRACTICE OF THE PUBLISHERS. DONT BUY IT IF YOU ALLREADY HAVE THE ACD2."
5,Larry Gatlin - dual albums,"Larry and brothers bring back great memories for me with this set of songs. Flawless vocals, excellent arrangements that blend their guitar skills and an orchestral background!"
3,the heat melts the plastic,"This rope lights looks alright, a lot less bright than any LED rope light.It is incandescent and heats up when you leave it on for a couple hours. Sometimes that the heat melts the plastic tube and gives off a plastic smell."
3,Sections out,"Had to return them for a new one. One section was out right out of the package. Amazon's return policy is awsome tho, and I got a new one right away. So far so good"
3,Good but...,The lights look really nice once they're up as long as a section of them doesn't go out. I had mine up for about a day before a foot and half section stopped lighting.
5,St. Thomas More by His Contemporaries,"The two period biographies are wonderful introductions to any thoughtful man or woman who wants to follow up on the excellent but of necessity somewhat Hollywood-y film version from 1967 or so, and the equally excellent Charlton Heston version from the early 1990s."
3,Nice music to add to your cd collection,I was satisfied with cd. All the Carmen Rodgers joints on it are good....it definitely worth checking out....
3,Disappointing,"Let me preface this by saying I am first generation German/American who is familiar with the language. My major gripe is the fact that the audio drills do not include the words in English, this is a major disadvantage compared to other courses such as Berlitz (who have the insight to include them). Secondly, the audio drills are spoken too fast, I found myself going beck 2-3 times to absorb what was said. Thirdly, because the drills were spoken so quickly the word were poorly enunciated, and that hinders comprehension. I was hoping to use this course in my car, which would be impossible, due to my previously mentioned reasons. This course would be best for someone who has the time to sit at home and listen while reading the book."
4,An excellent language program with a few flaws..........,"This 15 CD program provides all the necessities for becoming competent in the german language.Native speakers provide the opportunity for pronunciation and listening comprehension practice.Grammar essentials are also present. However,I do have two criticisms,one major,one minor. First,the accompanying book is RIFE with spelling and typeset errors,which can be confusing. Secondly,some of the phrases in the drills are rather silly. Would one ever REALLY say""I have many pretty french newspapers""?"
3,Help! Broken Disc!,"Does anyone know where to get replacement discs for this series? I broke disc three. It would not stay in its spot in the case, got caught in the case flap and broke when I put it back into the giant box. If it were the last disc, I could get over it.Help. Anyone.Please leave me a comment if you know or can help."
2,Not what I expected,"I've heard a lot of good things about this series from Barron's. I already speak a good deal of German but had lost my fluency so I gave the program a shot. I agree with other reviews in that the book is very good but the overall program is weak. Moreover, one of the male speakers on the CD is either a native of one of the many dialects spoken in Germany, or he is simply not a good speaker. Either way, I don't think his sentences are clear, especially if the listener was a German first-timer. I've tried the Italian course, and it's much better. For language courses though, nothing beats Pimsleur's comprehensive programs, but they cost three times as much."
5,Vibraciones de mi tierra,"It's amazing, nothing better in venezuelan performances. Thanks to Alfredo for give us that dream."
2,Good if you like poorly made movies.,"If you want to see a good horror movie, rent one that was released in the theaters. This was a waste of time."
1,Mine was defective,I can't really review the scale because it was defective; the number display wasn't operating correctly. I had to send it back. It seemed a bit flimsy and light to me.
1,Don't get your hands near this scale,"I liked the fact that this scale was suppose to work in the 0.1 OZ or 1gm range.Though what I found was, it seemed to only work for large weights. If I was looking to weight 11.2 oz it would fluctuate too much, going from 11.0 to 11.7 and back and forth. I found that if I zeroed out the scale and just put my hand over it without touching it, it would start a reading. I've tried it on my counter, on my floor and and my cement walkway, it did the same everywhere. I have since purchased an Escali scale and is currently working like a champ. No magic hand movement."
4,Good Product - Easy to Use,"This is a nice product which is easy to use and shows the results very clear in bold big fonts. Overall good value purchase. Arrived on time, that adds to its quality offering.Thanks,Ajay."
5,Love it!,I love love love this scale. I use it in my baking classes and it is fabulous! No complaints!!
5,MICHAEL IS THE PHANTOM ALL OVER AGAIN! (WELL..KINDA!)-Im 14!,"MICHAEL has done it again! EFX is one of his best CD's yet! (It and Phantom!) I'm listening 2 it as I write. The 1 horibble song is,""The Interglactic Circus of Wonders"". But after that one they do an irish jig...(I wonder...if Michael is dancing too!) AHHHHH! ""Somewhere in Time"", ""Nexus"", the end of ""EFX"" (And all of it!) are all good. In ""The Magic That Surrounds You"", he sounds a lot like Cornelous in ""Once Upon a Forest"" Really! When Auther sings with Michael later it is soo cute! ""Tonight"" has absolutly nothing to do with West Side Story. It is about when Harry Hoduni comes back from the dead and sings to his wife.""Counting Up To 20"" is sung by the character H.G. Wells and is really good! After that is my favorite song. At the end of that song, Michael sings in a different language. I love this cd!!!!!!!!!"
2,Michael Crawford can't sing; Where's David Cassidy???,great show and music but get rid of Michael Crawford. I heard there was a recording with David Cassidy; even Tommy Tune is better. I would like to find that recording if it is available. Crawford has never been able to hit pitch; he sounds like he is constantly trying to slide into it with his mousey voice.
2,Michael Crawford can't sing; Where's David Cassidy???,great show and music but without Michael Crawford. I heard there was a recording with David Cassidy; even Tommy Tune is better. I would like to find that recording if it is available.
