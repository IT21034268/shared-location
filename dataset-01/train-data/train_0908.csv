1,complete crap,"So, if you were ""held captive"", while being ENTIRELY free to go at any time, driving around, learning to use various weapons including guns, wouldn't fire the writer who created the whole ridiculous scenario? Wow.If an hour and a half of mediocre acting, and disgusting sex/rape, followed by a couple minutes of slow-motion, but somehow still boring violence appeals to you, you should be in prison. At which location, you will see first hand how messed up all the aforementioned events actually are. Have fun with all of that."
3,Not for everyone (for good reason),"When I was told about this movie by a friend, who is a movie collector, he didn't seem confused about whether he liked the movie or not but he knew he probably wouldn't watch it again. That's basically my take. It's a definitely a genre film from a very specific time period. The impression of the cover art is that the movie is over the top. It is, but not stylistically. There are a number of plot points that are completely absurd and I'm not sure how we're supposed to feel about the hardcore graphic rape scene which shows close ups of very unattractive penetration. It's a sadistic scene, not at all sexy to watch, and the only thing I can say about it is that it's effective in making you feel disturbed.I don't exactly feel satisfied at the end of the movie but I also don't feel ripped off. I'm not sorry I watched the movie. It was something I haven't seen before. But as I said, it's not an experience I think I'll go through again."
1,Thriller: a boring picture,"This movie makes watching paint dry look like ""The Killer"" by John Woo. The action in this movie is not only barely present, it is also shot in extreme slow motion, thus rendering the action actionless. One would do better to buy a can of some sugary beverage, open it, pour it into a glass and sit watching it day after day until it congeals into some sort of moldy mass; that would be much more exciting and entertaining.On to the sex scenes:The sex scenes in two words: They suck.The music/soundtrack:The music and soundtrack consists of some idiot who scraped together the money to buy an echoplex or whatever other early 70s echo device was around and then piped almost every sound through the device in order to make the viewer want to find him and break his toys.I have already dedicated too much time to this stinker."
1,A cruel picture indeed...,"A truly banal and grotesque movie with completely raw and indecorous scenes of phony violence and penetration that seem to arbitrarily punctuate the otherwise lame plot. At this point, I deem it unnecessary to go into the details of the story for the mere fact that it's completely pointless, and has been summed up in all of its glory elsewhere. The ""Tarantino"" reference seems misplaced at best, as this move bears no semblance to his slick stylized mayhem and tension driven flicks. One can compare viewing ""Thriller"" to observing the proto-art of the Neolithic era and noting some very oblique similarities of the pornographic cave carvings to the works of Rubens. So, in that anthropological sense, it is a quite curious yet not a wholly pleasing experience. Buy at your own risk."
3,"Depressing, Sick Movie","What can I really say about this movie? Some svenghali-like kook abducts a young pretty girl, cuts her eye out, shoots her up with smack and turns her into a hooker. On the low-down, she learns karate and how to shoot rifles. I wouldn't want to be a spoiler, so let's just say she enacts a brutal revenge for her less than humane treatment.This is a very slow-pace, disheartening and vile movie. For the most part I liked it. It just dragged at certain times and the XXX footage was clearly spliced in."
1,Disappointing cult film,I'd looked forward to watching this for a long time.I wasn'expecting a masterpiece but was sorely disapponted at this inept piece of moviemaking.Bad acting.Bad direction.Bad photography.The action scenes were handled with no style whatsoever.Makes Jess Franco look like Bergman.
3,weird,A crazy swedish lass lent me this film and i had a powercut 2 minutes into it. I did get round to watching it the next night and it was simply weird weird weird. I was not expecting so much gratuitous sex but hey...it was very similar in vein to I spit on your Grave. I have nothing further to say.
4,Vietnam: A Quick Guide to Customs & Culture,"As the title says, the book is a quick guide to Vietnamese customs and etiquette. It does not go into great depth but covers the subjects overall pretty well. I'd recommend it. Contents include how to avoid culture shock; Vietnamese attitudes and values; historical and political background; religion, customs, and traditions; the Vietnamese at home; leisure, social, and cultural life; dos, don'ts, and taboos; body language; hospitality, food, and drink; giving and receiving gifts; business briefing; and language and communications. That's a lot to cover in 168 pages in a pocket sized book. I'd also recommend ""Vietnam Today"" by Mark A. Ashwill for a little more depth."
1,Out of Date,"This might have been a little useful five years ago when it was first published, but it is quite out of date in 2011. I would not recommend purchasing it until, and if, it is updated. Vietnamese people have really moved forward in the last decade and are currently a bustling and very capitalistic society. Also, it is relatively superficial and provides relatively little of practical use."
4,"great for understanding history, culture, and customs of Vietnam","This is not a tour guide but a great introduction to customs of Vietnam. It is essential for anyone going to Vietnam for business. I read it in preparation for my photographic trip to Vietnam and while it will not help me with my photography, it will help me understand the country and customs."
3,mostly dance club material,"Having been a fan of Tom Tom Club since their their spinoff from Talking Heads, this one is a little disappointing. At first listen, it wasn't the type of CD I just wanted to hear over again as soon as it was over(unlike, for example, main Head David Byrne's '97 effort ""Feelings""). Before making a final opinion, though, I wanted to give it a few spins. Unfortunately, with a few exceptions, it's not a great CD. I imagine the entire CD would sound great in an all night dance club with computer controlled lights, etc., but it's not the type of CD I'd drive around listening to while on the beach, or have as background music if you had some neighbors over for some snacks and drinks. Make no mistake, however, Tom Tom Club put on a great show, so go see it if you can, and their previous albums, by and large, will probably hold up better over time."
1,I can't believe there are no written accents!,"I was looking forward to reading this classic French novel on my Kindle with my newly installed default Barron's French-English dictionary to help me along. But then I discovered that there are no written accents in the edition.Don't buy this edition unless you like to see a denuded written version of the French language. Ct√© and Cote are actually different words in French.A great disappointment. How do I get my money back for a Kindle book that says ""French edition"" but it is not in real French?"
5,the best,"ALL the tracks are sensual, delicious, and will have you sailing across the dance floor all night and into the morning. Forget Ricky Martin, and all the boy bands when you hear these men. Lovely, their voices and rhythms caress the body and mind and send you sailing......."
4,The South Beach Sound.....,"I have to say, I love the song ""Where Do You Go."" I was in South Beach in a club in April of '96, and they played this song. I went to other clubs at that time and they always have played this song. So now I think of South Beach when I hear it. The rest of th CD is pretty cool. It has a hip hop/freestyle and latin twist which is cool. I was shocked to find out these guys where from Miami, because they have that miami sound, and what is that sound you ask?.....Buy this cd!"
4,Great CD,"No Mercy is a pretty good band and perfect for anyone interested in latin beat/slow rock. ""Where Do You Go"" and ""Please Don't Go"" are almost the exact same song, but the other songs make up for it.""Where Do You Go"" is not the end of this band's talent! It's too bad you don't here about these guys more often."
5,HBO Sports does a great job!,"I bought this for my Yankee fan dad and he enjoyed the stories of these three ""Yankee greats."" HBO Sports always does a great job showing you the behind-the-scenes of the lives and has a good flow of story. I'd recommend if you like and appreciate the history of the Yankee organization or enjoy stories of baseball legends."
3,mixed bread review,"This bread is a feast for the eyes as well as the taste buds. Good instructions and read them before you want to prepare the bread so you can make sure you have everything you need before hand.There are some draw backs:1. Takes longer to make than the instructions say, give extra hour.2. If you do not have a bread mixer have very strong hands.3. The bread will go stale quickly and there is a lot of it. Share."
3,Amazon should correct this typo: Original price of $557????,There is no way the original price of this item was $557. Amazon should correct this typo.
1,Poorly Made,"These curtains do have a cute pattern, but I could have made these with buttons and glue. I was very disappointed in the quality of construction."
3,UNFLINCHING REALISM STILL ROMANTIC,"Ron's Hansen's first novel, DESPERADOS, is the story of the Dalton gang as related by Emmett Dalton, the lone survivor. Written in gritty Western noir style, Mr Hansen's unflinching realism attempts to tell the tale without romanticism. Yet, strangely, the reader is left rooting for these pathological killers as they shoot down men trying to protect their property and their lives. This empathy, intended or not, may be the product of Mr Hansen's skill as a writer, which is evident in DESPERADOS. Still, I found myself manipulated by the cardboard, unflattering portraits of honest citizens who were shot down by this band of thieves and murderers. Your call. Three and one-half stars."
2,bizarre and over-written,"Or bizarrely over-written. Bought this after reading Hansen's book about Jesse James. I should have left well enough alone. This is a tawdry, aggressively ugly, ""revisionist"" portrait of the Old West."
3,Just OK,"I do not have the time to write a full review and believe that my headline comment expresses my view of the book under review,"
4,GREAT INSIGHT INTO DOGFIGHTING,VERY INTERESTING TO READ HOW FIGHTER PILOTS DID THEIR JOBS AND HOW THEY LOOKED AT THE ENEMY. THE BRITISH AND GERMAN WW II PILOTS WERE RATHER GENTLEMANLY ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF FIGHTING. THE NO. OF PILOTS WHO DIED WAS TERRIBLE BUT THEY SEEMD SO BLAS'E (?) ABOUT IT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IN WW II HOW THEY FLEW AT 19000 FT. IN OPEN COCKPITS WITHOUT OXYGEN OR MUCH HEAT. EXCELLENT BOOK!

5,Nice!,"I bought this because my dad had these songs on cassette tape, he would play it in his car often, but then some bastard broke in and stole our stereo. I hope he is dropping the soap in jail."
3,Lifting gloves noob,Good. Seams were a bit rough on the inside. But I'm new to lifting so I don't know if they all feel that way.
5,Rules for Corporate Radicals,"Rules for Corporate Warriors is an outstanding book. If you work in corporation besieged by activists and you haven't read this book, your reading is sadly deficient.Nichols' decision to take a forthright stance is rooted in his sophisticated understanding of how this ""industry"" operates. It is just a pity that more people in the media don't possess the same grasp of this totally unregulated, global multi-billionindustry.Rules for Corporate Warrirors flies in the face of the so-called ""conventional wisdom"" in corporations which is to hand over a large check before finding somewhere to hide and just hoping that they don't come back.As Nichols so amply illustrates, the problem is that the activists do come back; after all, the activists need money in order to critique capitalism properly.Written in an engaging manner, it is book that takes to the prevailing paradigm of issues management with a sledgehammer.But not before time."
1,"Whether you are a CEO or activist, this book is Junk","This book is not even worth the 27 cents you can buy it for. Don't waste your time, there are much more sophisticated and contemporary ways of advancing business interests in a responsible and highly profitable way. To live without integrity might be alluring to some, but ultimately it is not fulfilling or patriotic. I am proud to live in America. This guy sucks, from a corporate American standpoint. Nick Nichols, stop wasting our time with this kind of trash, we dont want it, and there is already enough mind pollution in our country. Leave good thinking to those who can do it."
1,Rules for Corporate Profiteering,"Social equity in business is obviously a totally foreign concept to Nick Nichols. His Rules for Corporate Warriors is nothing more than a recipe book for companies looking to pile up big profits without any concern for the environment or social justice. Activists have made great progress in recent years forcing companies to change how they do business. Now comes this book of strategies for stopping ""attacks"" on business by ""radicals."" For those who don't want to see a return to the days when companies cared about nothing but their shareholders, this book is a call to arms. Take out your dogged-eared copies of Saul Alinsky's classic and let's go get `em."
1,The new release doesn't work but the older version did,"A couple years ago I bought her complete box set from my local video store. I LOVED her workouts! I never got bored and I reached my target weight in only 5 months. It was great for the winter months. However, after a couple years of use, 2 of the 3 CDs got scratched so I reordered them from Amazon.However, the since the time I bought them, they have redone the cover design and it is evident also the quality of reproduction for the CD has been compromised. The new versions don't work properly in my dvd player. I even went out and bought a new dvd player after Amazon shipped me a second set of videos which didn't work. The problem didn't go away. Basically, they either don't read, or when they do read in the player, the menu doesn't work right or the video skipps. Very dissapointing since I actually looked forward to working out with her."
1,Not good at all,"I was very dissappointed in this DVD. It advertises ""1000's of Hours"" but you can only program 20 minutes of cardio at a time. I have other customizable DVD's and you are able to program at least 45 minutes of cardio. Because of the misadvertising, I give this 1 star"
3,pretty but....,I wanted this trunk to help my daughter organize her American Girl Doll MANY clothes and accessories. It has accomplished that but twice the pins holding the hinges of the trunk have dropped out and luckily we found them. It was easy to put them back in but makes us both uneasy as to the durability of this product and worrisome that we might lose the pins at some time. It wasn't cheap and I was surprised to have this happen to say the least. It is pretty but....
5,GREAT!!!!!!,"I purchased this trunk for my 7 year old granddaughter. When it arrived, I was more than please with the quality of it.I would recommend this product."
2,Could have been a lot better,"Given the single review I thought this would be a good addition to by collection of gay genre films. Overall I was very disappointed. I have seven other Philippine movies that are well made. This one was disjointed, hard to follow, subtitles would fly across the screen with not enough time to read. Overall, it felt like a high school production. I think I understood what the writer was trying to communicate, the circles of life, but he did not execute well."
2,she can do better than that,"Tebaldi had beautiful voice, but she is boring here. Callas is far better in this role, really."
4,Disappointing,"I usually do pretty copious research before making a purchase and buying a yoga dvd is no exception. This seemed a popular choice and had many positive reviews. I expected the PM portion to be too advanced since that is what most poor reviews complained of. I hoped the AM portion would be eonough of a practice for a near beginner like me to keep busy.Unfortunately, I found the AM practice too short to actually feel that I had accomplished anything. I felt neither stretched, challenged, or especially relaed. My other complaint is the commercial (which you are not allowed to fast forward) seems to go on forever.I think Rodney Yee and Patricia Walden are pretty accomplished yogi's (hence the 4 stars) so may try one of his/her other tapes in the future. This one I will return."
4,Wonderful (5 stars really),"I love Rodney Yee's morning practice. It's gentle but not boring. I like the streching. I do wonder what advanced yogis do in the morning...I also like the PM one, although I didn't at first. (Patricia Walden drove me mental with the 'soft, deep inhalations....deep, soft exhalations..."") Now I use it all the time, almost as often as the morning one.Both programs are provide good stretches and twists and good mind-clearing and relaxation that any modern (i.e., stressed out) person would benefit from."
2,Not for experienced yoga fans!,"As much as I like and respect Rodney Yee, I found this video too basic for me. Each stretch is not held long enough to allow the muscle to relax. I felt rushed through the entire AM session. For me I have to pause each pose to achieve relaxation and then continue. In doing that it disrupts my zen space. In short, if you have NEVER done yoga before, go for it. This video is short 20 minutes sessions, and will give you a flavor of what yoga is. On the other-hand, if you are a yoga enthusiast, try one of Rodney Yee's other videos."
3,Good for beginners,This is a good wake up and night relax dvd. It takes way too long to get throught the intro advertisement though.
2,"AM is OK, PM is Horrible","The AM section of this DVD is OK for beginners like me. It moves a little quickly, but I got the hang of it after a couple of sessions. The PM section is HORRIBLE for inflexible beginners, and it is NOT relaxing or soothing at all. Most of it requires you to stand up and do very harsh, fast pulling and twisting of the legs and back. I thought the PM section would help me get to sleep, but instead I went to bed with my back hurting & creaking, and feeling stressed out and frustrated. I will have to find another DVD to get a soothing stretch before bedtime. I would not recommend this DVD to beginners."
2,"Writing in English, Instruction in French - Can't Return It!","I had to open this dvd (cover in English) and select play on a menu written in English to find out that ALL of the verbal instructions were being given in French. Now that I've opened it, I can't return it per Amazon policy! I'm sure it's a good dvd and would love to find out but I'm not willing to take the risk of buying another one at full price when it could be as useless as the first. I don't speak the French language. (By the way, it's not anything that can be changed on the menu - my only option was to select French subtitles!) I think I deserve a refund."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped.,Interesting but the AM portion quite weak. Would have expected more from these people.
3,Not what I was looking for,I mistakenly purchased this AM PM Yoga instead of AM. & P.M. Yoga - Conditioning for Weight Loss. I was hoping for something more physically challenging.
1,Rubbish,"I bought this DVD after reading the other reviews, which were all very positive. However, I found the DVD to be way too easy and way too short and way too dull. They kept doing these really strange poses and talking like they were on wacky backy and the guy was half naked, you could see his nipples poking out everywhere. Not really relaxing if you ask me."
3,AM is Good,"The AM part of this video is excellent. It is definately geared towards a yoga beginner and it is a great way to start the day. However, the PM portion of the video is very challenging and I find it way too difficult. Definately not for beginners."
4,Light workouts,"These are pretty light workouts, about 20 minutes each, so if you are looking to build up a sweat you better check out Rodney Yee's Power Yoga DVD's. However, these are excellent exercises for starting up in the morning or winding down at the end of the day when you don't feel like doing a total workout. I particularly like the PM workout, which offers more stretches and relieves more knots from the course of the day."
1,PM Better,I read many of the reviews here before purchasing it so I expected theAm section to be good and the PM very unusable as everyone said. I wassurprised then to find the PM so much better then the reviews said. TheAm section left me feeling sleepy like I want to go back to bed. The PMis energizing. The poses are held longer so you actually feel something- though I wish for still longer! I suggest switching the Am & PMsection. I think this may work better.One pet peeve: wish they did not move so fast between exercises. Thisis my second Rodney Yee DVD and the other one left me frustrated as wellin this respect. I find myself always playing catch up and the twistingto look at the screen upsets my alignment and equilibrium and does notrelax me.I do like how they explain how to use props and you get to do just that!
1,Too Fast Too Vague,"I have taken Tai Chi (Taiji) as a class and I have self learned Belly Dancing and the number key compoent for these two practices to be useful and succesful is: Posture!! And while I know both of these practices are not yoga related, the point is in every physical discipline posture is key. This DVD tells you nothing about posture at all and since its a beginners DVD I would think it should. In yoga stances he never tells you what position your hips, shoulders, and back should be in. All and all I find it too confusing. Plus he speeds through yoga much too fast. I've never taken yoga and even I feel way too rushed. As soon as you get into a stance your changing before you can even ""feel"" the stance. I think it would be great as a routine to set up for someone who already knows a little yoga, but its definatly not for beginners. Big ol' disappointment if you ask me!"
2,Sergei,"Yoga for the 21st century. Superficial and rushed.If you have ever done any stretching or yoga this will be too easy for you. Perhaps geriatirics would find it useful. The elementary poses are not ""held"" at all diminishing their value. There is virtually no emphasis on ""breath"" and breathing, a second major fault in my opinion."
2,"Good, could be better","A great introduction to yoga. Pleasant and easy to follow, but very hurried in presentation. If you plan to follow along with the DVD you will find the poses hurried and impossible to follow."
5,A good one for beginners,"A lovely tape with lovely Rodney Yee starting off your morning. A teensy bit fast, but then he's young! You can go slower. It VERY well done."
1,Dissapointing,"I have had several Rodney Yee yoga videos in the past that were great so this purchase was easy. The product delivered is of a very poor production quality. It actually looks like a recording of a recording. Not expected from a DVD. Getting beyond the production, the exercise content is very minimal. The instruction is for ABSOLUTE beginners (people that have never attempted yoga) which is frustrating because the DVD cannot be returned now that it is open. Wish I had paid closer attention to the reviews and description before this purchase."
5,Good for beginners,It is a very nice dvd for introduction to yoga. It allows you to deepen into the workout but I want something more challenging..
3,Relaxing not energizing,"Bought this DVD for my retirement age parents with the hope it would ease them into yoga. It is definitely an easy DVD for beginners, however I was disappointed with the am routine. It is mostly performed on the floor, with little flow. It is more like a morning meditation. If you had it set to play just as you were waking up it might be nice to help you literally wake up out of sleep. But if wake up, get your yoga clothes on, take out a mat (and whatever else you might do to get ready for a morning yoga session) the routine feels more like it is putting you back to sleep instead of energizing you for the day."
4,Nice Workout with mediocre production,"I like that this DVD has two completely different workouts. In particular, the morning half is a wonderful way to wake up.The reason I don't use it much is that it plays a 5 minute (seems like 20) commercial. Always. No skipping, no fast forwarding. Drives me nuts."
1,not for seniors,I have tapes by Lelias and Peggy Cappy which are mild and for beginners. The a.m. part of this is mild and Rod Yee is adequate. The p.m. portion by Pat Walden moves too quickly and without timely explanations. I am in my 70's and some of these postures are impossible for me as they would be for any beginner of senior age. Another big minus is that the production seems as interested in shooting beautiful scenery as they are in the yoga positions. Even though the scenery in Death Valley and the Hawii beaches are dramatic -- there is no excuse for having long distance shots of yoga positions. This is not for beginners or seniors.
2,Very uneven in pace and ability,"I have been doing yoga only for about 6 months, all via DVD instruction. I very much enjoy AM Yoga For Your Week, also by Rodney Yee, which I give 5 stars. I had high hopes for this video, but must give it only 2 stars. The DVD has two practices, one for AM, led by Rodney Yee, and the second for PM, led by Patricia Walden. I find the AM session very simple, so in that respect it is good for a beginner, but I feel that Rodney speeds through the poses extremely quickly. I use the pause button to allow time to hold the pose before moving on, but I feel this really interferes with the session. In contrast I find the PM session much more challenging, expecting great flexibility and at least moderate strength in the poses and transitions. The pace of this practice is much better however. Due to this unevenness I do not recommend this DVD."
5,Quick shipping & perfect condition,I like this yoga video from the past. I ordered it and it came right away in perfect condition. Thank you!
5,Best AM Yoga,"I've been doing this 15 minute yoga routine first thing daily since I was introduced to it 3 years ago by a friend. It is short but includes quite a few poses and is a good start to the day. The PM portion is too difficult for me but the DVD is worth it for the AM portion alone. I've gotten many others to use it too and they feel the same. Still the best for a 13 minute workout in early a.m.(I use the 3rd & 4th section) that has stretching, bending and twisting at 6 years. Do more yoga later if I have time but this is great and don't even have to open your eyes, very good directions."
4,yet to use,I ordered it and have watch it several times but I just haven't had the time to really get into using it regularly.
4,Worth it,"I have had a lot of back problems over the years. I bought this video years ago and the AM section with Rodney Yee has helped me to strengthen and resolve issues, as well as prevent any further injuries. The PM video, however, is not so great. That one just hurts and you may as well throw it out. But its worth it to buy to AM routine."
3,Disappointed...,My co-worker really liked it and recommended it to me. He said it helped him sleep better. I tried and it's just ok? Nothing to write home about.
4,"Good, Not Fantastic","I have been practicing yoga for several years. I ordered this DVD in the hopes of testing out Rodney Yee and trying something new.I didn't think the positions were terribly difficult, but I did find them somewhat jarring. This is mostly due to Rodney's style of fluid yoga, a style I'm not used to. I prefer to hold positions longer than he instructs.Other than personal preference, the DVD lived up to its promises and I would recommend it to yogi's of all experience levels, especially if they are already fans of Rodney Yee."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I have been practicing Yoga for 2 years, but I am still a beginner. The morning workout is too short and seems like it should be the evening/relaxing workout. There are very few true Yoga poses. I do not get much ouf of this Yoga video. Doing streches on my own would have the same impact. I am very disappointed."
5,Rodney Yee's yoga videos are always good.,I've tried several yoga teachers and the only one who is consistently good is Rodney Yee.
2,"Falls Short, just like the length","I just bought this DVD along with another Yoga DVD. This one is more of a meditation and relaxation video than a workout video. Most people say the segments are each 20 minutes long, but that's only if you do all of the meditation. The workouts are actually 13 minutes for the AM and 18 minutes for the PM. The other video I purchased has so much more to offer with more than one routine and much more length. If you don't want to spend a lot of time working out, press stop when you're ready. This video is over before you know it. In addition, the PM section wakes you up more than the AM, so I'd reverse the order when using. Definitely go for a Bryan Kest video."
2,Not for me,This was not what I was looking for in a morning Yoga DVD. The music is so loud I can not hear him when he talks. I don't feel like I get much out of the short 20 minute practice.
2,meditation,This product is OK. I was not greatly impressed with the format. I'm trying to learn new ways to relax.
3,Ying & Yang,The A.M. is good for me. The P.M. is good in parts but there are many parts I can't do. Of course I'm not young anymore ... nor as limber as I'd like to be so I'll keep trying.
1,Not for beginners,I viewed this video w/ a friend and it was way too hard. He goes way too fast and gives poor direction. I am sure if you are familiar w/ yoga it is a breeze but I would not recommend for a first timer
5,Happy Customer,"I was happy with the time of delivery, and the condition of product when I received it. Love this DVD."
5,A.M. and P.M. Yoga,I purchased Rodney Yee's yoga tape at the recommendation of my doctor. I had a stroke 3 years ago and have had a long recovery. Starting yoga with Rodney Yee has been very calming and has increased my flexibility. I found it very easy to follow and a very refreshing way to start the day. I recommend it highly.
3,OK but not great,"First off, let me say that I like Rodney Yee very much. I have one of his other DVDs (maybe it was Power Yoga?) and I love it. However, this particular DVD is not as challenging as I would like and does not have as much variety in poses as I would like. So over all, I would recommend yoga DVDs by Rodney Yee, but this one would not be my first or second choice."
5,AM and PM Yoga by Rodney Yee,Loved this yoga series as a VCR tape and it finally wore out. This DVD was the answer!
5,Good for Beginners,"If you haven't done Yoga before, this dvd is the right choice for you. My advice is if you aren't a beginner, it's not worth it to buy and try this.My friend was amazed how easy to follow it was and she is looking into Yoga now. Morning Yoga is good before starting your busy day. Evening Yoga is helpful to recover your relaxing and calm condition."
4,A little advanced for the beginner,"Either this is a little advanced for the beginner or I am really out of shape. Ok, so I might be really out of shape. I have only used this video a few times to add a little spice into my typical workouts and I am always sore the next day. Some of the moves are really tough to get into the right position and are even harder to hold for any length of time. Seriously, what I like best about this video is the music for the PM video. It is so calming and relaxing. I kid you not, sometimes I put the DVD on just to help me relax and fall asleep."
4,Great for a beginner like me!,"This DVD has been a wonderful introduction to yoga! I wanted a short less boring stretch routine, so I'm trying yoga. I've only had it for about a week, and I use it everyday...plus I ordered a mat and 2 more yoga DVDs. That's how much I love AM and PM Yoga for beginners.Relaxing outdoor settings are a must and soothing non annoying instructors complete this great 2 part routine. I think my old rotator cuff injury is finally loosening up more!The downside, and this is minor, the PM yoga is a little tough - but doable. Recommended, you won't be sorry."
4,A.M. and P.M. Yoga for Beginners,"I enjoy using this yoga DVD, however I gave it four stars, because you can not fast forward to the exercise part. You have to watch the beginning advertisements every time you want to exercise with the DVD. This DVD is for beginners, however, the AM Yoga is short and quick to use for starting your day and the PM Yoga is great for after a stressful day after work."
4,good dvd,"I use this dvd quite a lot because sometimes it is the only one I have time for. Also, in the morning I can't do too much. I love the morning one with Rodney Yee, he is my favorite. It is very gentle and relaxing but gives a good stretching. Not good if you are wanting a challange. The PM one is good also, more challanging. I know some people have wrote that it didn't put them to sleep and it doesn't. But I don't think that is what it is suppose to do. It relaxes you and relieves stress. Beautiful scenery like all the Gaiam dvds."
2,Why is this popular ?,"Did this guy appear on Oprah ?If he did, that's the reason.All the ladies are buying whatever appeared on Oprah.Will I buy this ?Waste of money and time."
1,Delivery Time Slow,I placed my order on May 9th before 12:00 PM and the item arrived May 17th in the afternoon. It took a total of 8 days for it to get here via USPS. Anyone ordering this from the Northeast should double check their shipping options if they are in a rush for this project.
3,not satisfied,The music is louder than the voices so it is hard to hear the directions. The workouts are shorter than I would like. The whole dvd seems too short even though it says it is 100 min. Not enough different poses.
4,Great product!,"I do the P.M. Yoga every night. It is very relaxing and helps me get ready for sleep. The A.M. Yoga is an good transition from sleeping to activity. Neither are very strenuous and I found that, as someone completely new to yoga, the poses were easy to get. The first few times, there were muscles being stretched and used that I didn't know I had, but it still wasn't too hard. More than anything this DVD is stretching. Some poses require a little stamina, but overall this is a very approachable routine.There are several warnings and advirtisements before you can access the main menu, but some of them it lets you skip. The background of the A.M. yoga (with Rodney Yee) is soft ocean waves. The sound of the surf I found to be relaxing. The P.M. Yoga (with Patricia Walden) is set in a desert, with a gentle wind.Overall a worthy buy."
4,Relaxation Yoga but not any real poses,It's a great tool for relaxing in the morning and evenings. Both of the instructors speak well and the background scenery is nice. It not really yoga for practicing basic poses but more a relaxation tool.
4,Very Good,"The 20 minute workouts are great if you are in a hurry. I like the way Rodney Yee breezes through the workouts, and keep things moving. You may need to do the video 3 or 4 times to get the hang of it, then it is more fluid."
3,Yoga For The Not So Beginner,"While the instruction in this beautifully done DVD is clear, I found that the poses are not for beginners. I have been doing yoga for eight months and struggled with getting into some of the poses properly. The A.M./P.M. format is GREAT!"
2,pm yoga for beginners,This am/pm for beginners is really not for beginners. The pm part is extremely hard unless you have been doing yoga for many many yrs. I exercise alot and love to walk. I started yoga about 6 months ago. I'm 60 yrs. old and have no problem doing my other 5 yoga dvd's. This pm yoga is not at all for beginners. I thought I would have no problem. I enjoy yoga at least 6 days a wk. Please do not tell people it is for beginners . It's really for people with many yrs of experience. Yoga has changed my life.
3,Extremely basic,"This is a BEGINNER workout for BEGINNERS. Very basic. It is an excellent way to wake up, but if you're looking to wake your muscles and jog them a little bit then I would go with the next step up."
4,a.m. and p.m. yoga,"Have used this product for years. Started with the old video; have used the dvd since it came out, now on 2nd one. If is my favorite for a quick stretch & meditation starter."
3,Relaxing Yoga,The PM yoga is very relaxing. Have not tried the AM yet. The woman's outfit is slightly distracting otherwise it's good.
4,Love the AM!,"I absolutely LOVE the AM yoga routine. It is very easy, and it's great for beginners. It does exactly as it says it will: wakes you up to be ready for the day while keeping you relaxed. This is also great for me because it helps me to be less anxious throughout the day. It may not be descriptive enough, but I recommend actually watching ANY follow-along fitness video before trying to do it. That way you aren't staring at the tv while trying to touch your toes.I didn't really care for the PM yoga routine, it didn't seem to flow as well for me. It was much worse than the AM for giving detailed directions.I loved the AM so much, I'd recommend you buy it for that alone. This is great paired with Rodney Yee's ""Yoga for Beginners""."
3,Good/fair,I like it. It's good for someone who wants to get a brief session of relaxation and meditation into their daily routine. Only negative is that it might get a little boring after a while though b/c there is only the two sessions (one AM and one PM).
3,Good,"I had no idea of what Yoga is/was, this dvd is good. The moves aren't hard and you feel totally relaxed afterwards... good buy"
4,"Walden good, Yee too Fast","Patricia Walden does a fair job of explaining and holding the poses. Rodney Yee is a bit too quick. I am normally on the floor just listening to what to do, but when I look up, Yee is already in the pose and beginning to release. The narration is a bit behind the action. You can still get a good stretch (have the pause button handy). Watch the extra video using the props if you are a beginner. The 3rd yoga routine probably helps beginners see more about how to position ones self for each pose."
4,There are better Rodney DVDs!,"I am partial to this because it was my first yoga DVD. It is pretty slow like other reviewers have said and I grew out of it quickly but it is great when you don't know anything yet. If you are a total beginner you might like this. I think there are better Rodney DVDs available. Look at his older ones, not his newer."
3,Interesting,Typical National Geographic take on history. Lots of background info but not much on how people actually lived day to day. I was looking for more in depth study of everyday live and politics of that time.
4,Incomplete,"FYI, this DVD contains 6 parts plus a bonus part. The original National Geographic special, and the DVDs sold on its website, contains 8 parts. This version is missing two episodes. I was not aware of this and will be returning it. I took one star off for the omission. I've viewed parts of this series on the National Geographic channel, however, and it is great and deserves the other stars."
2,Everything you already new about rome,"To me this dosen't seem to be up to NG's normal standards. Throughout the three DVD's they re-use many of the scenes over and over again. This isn't a comprehensive history of rome just the same old Julius, Caligula, Pompeii, Brutus stories told over again and not very well."
2,Not worth the money,Just buy a cheap light colored bandana and soak it in cold water. I haven't seen were this thing does more than cover my head. I soak it in cold water and periodicly rinse and re soak get through doing the lawn.
1,One of the best sequels ever,"this film was more creppy than the original in so many elements: the slime was growing when people were p*ssed off. the scoleri brothers were scarier than slimer the song monologue when the ghostbusters were in the nuthouse Vigo the painting shows up more than Gozer in part one. Though there are punchlines that people might repeat such as the ""sometimes s**t happens"", it could've work better as a comedy like the original. Anyway, this is the only sequel i watch during my senior year because there were somethings that made me freaked out. I have the entire soundtrack and I get crazed on the sequel whenever I'm scared or in a jolly mode. This if the first movie you should see on Halloween then the original and so forth."
4,Ghostbusters I and Ghostbusters II,Enjoyed movie with grandson. Purchased movie for 9 year old grandsons' request and first Ghostbusters' movie. Would recommend movie to others.
5,The Kids Loved It,"I never saw GB II. The original GB was pretty awesome, but my kiddos were bored and we rented this. The whole gang (10,9, 7) really enjoyed it."
3,nice,"Like the seller very much, but the film is not complete. I remember a line from the movie maybe it was @the theater or the video when Bill Murray was talking to the painting, it is not here on the dvd, kinda disappointed. But still a great movie."
5,Love the Movie,"If you like the Ghostbusters movies then you should get this DVD. It is a good quality in sound and picture. My only disappointment was the cases that are being used. Unlike the older cases that are entirely plastic, these new ones have a number of cutouts in the front and back plastic and the only thing protecting the DVD is the paper inserts. Otherwise the movie was just what I expected."
3,Good,This movie is not as good as the orignal but still isnt too bad. The thing I dont get is you can get both Ghostbusters 1 and 2 on dvd for $13. Why would you want to buy this seperate for the same price. I will admit the first Ghostbusters on the first dvd release had an amazing main menu.
1,Disappointing,"A very disappointing movie from so many talented actors and professionals. The movie was very dark and slightly disturbing, lacking the creativity and humor of the first one."
5,A truly phenomenal movie.,"This movie is easily as funny as the original, and perhaps in some parts even more so. Keeping the same cast made sure that this movie was nothing less than positively electrifying. The cast go together like a pretty good cocktail, ya? Roll on the third installment."
3,A great sequel,"I Love the Ghostbusters movies. To me there just comedies. This one really scared me when I saw it. Dan Aykroyd is great. He should of directed this movie. The second Tale revolves around a misterious painting that is alive and well in the museum of Art located in NEW YORK. I enjoyed this one thouroughly. It talks about the bad vives or spirits flowing around NEW YORK CITY. Director:Ivan Reitman.Cast:Dan Aykroyd.Harold Ramis.Rick Moranis. Ernie Hudson.Sigourney Weaver and Bill Murray with a CAMEO appearance by Brian Doyle Murray,Bill Murray's older brother."
3,Not as good as the first!,This movie just isn't as good at the first.First of all it is not as funny and the villain is just a blasted picture! Sure this picture trying to take over the world but he can't go anywhere and he barely destroys anything unlike the marshmellow man in the original.It's my advice that you buy the first one and maybe rent the second one.But thats just my opinion.
3,I have a hamper?,"As far as i am concerned, the first movie was much better, however i still enjoy this one greatly. I think that the plot is well developed and i happen to like the fact that they skip five years in between the two movies. It makes you kindof think at the begging of the movie , ""hey! what the hell is going on here?"" It really works your mind on some stuff and there is a lot of irony in this movie related to the first one. ""You don't act like a scientist."" ""they're usually kind of stiff."" ""You're more like a game show host."" That was Dana and Pete talking in the first movie. Now Pete hosts a talk show. That is just one example. There are many more and there are ironic points in the movie that foreshadow further events very creatively. I thought it was very good, however the first movie is far superior."
4,"""Vhy am I dripping viz goo?""",What can I say? I love this movie! It's the best movie ever! It's one of those movies that you could watch over and over again. You'll laugh for hours!
3,Not as good,"While Ghostbusters II has some good laughs, it is pretty much an overlong, silly sequel that doesn't do justice to the original. It uses a bunch of silly effects that were cool when I was eight, but just look ridiculous now. Janosz is an extremely stupid character, and it takes much too long for the story to get going. Winston is still underused, the ending is good, and the trial was too much of a farce. The best thing about this movie was the acting. All the ghostbusters and Rick Moranis all did outstanding jobs. The ending to the movie was horrible.This movie wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good. See it for yourself and judge."
4,worthy sequel,"Ghostbusters 2 wasn't better than the first but it was just as good. The story was good and all of the returning actors did a fine job. I liked the slime guns, the statue of liberty scene, and I thought that Vigo the Carpathian was more of a spookier spirit than Gozer from the first film. Plus, I think the logo from Ghostbusters 2 looks better than the logo from the first Ghostbusters. Unfortunately, the DVD for Ghostbusters 2 does not have near as many extras as the origional Ghostbusters DVD."
3,Good Movies!,Well Ghostbusters II didn't quite live up to part one but what sequal does? I really liked Ghostbuster's but had never seen part too and it was really a let down. Part one deserves more than 3 stars but part two really drug it down.
2,Eyewitness Travel Guides are inconsistent,I have found Eyewitness travel guides inconsistent. They are not all organized the same way and are not always helpful. The maps in the Poland guide were useless and I found many descriptions lacking. Much of what is written about accomadations and restaurants is inaccurate.
3,.5 bucks :),Its a 5 buck shirt.. Its almost disposable; two dry cleanings would cost as much. My amazon prime membership makes these deals worth it.
4,Good Quality and good price,i bought this item for 7.5$ it's good quality and the image as described
3,Great item for the price,"This is a extremely good buy for the buck. Yes, it is a bit thin, but that is why you wear undershirts. It is not for dress, but a great casual dress w or without a seater or coat."
4,Need a shirt? Buy this one.,"I don't know why people are complaining. The fabric isn't THAT thin. On top of that, the shirt is cheaper than a bad t-shirt you get on vacation. Not to mention that it actually looks good.Buy your neck size (i.e. whatever Men's Warehouse told you) and it'll fit. I'm very happy. The thing isn't see through, and it's quite comfy. Just make sure you remove all the needles holding the shirt to the packaging otherwise you might get hurt. A sweet shirt for the price for sure!"
3,So So quality,"The quality of the shirt mathces its price. If you are a cotton lover, this shirt is not your choice. It is yet not too bad, but it is not a shirt for everyday wear."
3,Good Quality but not Great,"The French Blue color and the collar are great but the threading is a little on the thin side. Great for Spring or Summer but in the colder months, you are going to need a sweater. The lighter colors would probably be a little translucent so keep that in mind. Still, good value for the $5 I paid."
1,These shirts require a lot of ironing.,"These shirts seemed to be a good buy, and I liked the cotton/synthetic mix since this usually means that they are easy care. However, once washed, these shirts require as much ironing as an all cotton shirt."
4,Good shirt for the bucks,"Well, the good is the value. The bad? Maybe it's kind thin? I haven't really find much yet since I'm no expert of clothing. It's pretty comfortable, though. For that price, I really won't complain."
4,Very thin...,"This is a decent looking shirt, especially for the price paid. It is extremely thin though and will need to wear a t shirt under it. I gave it 4 stars mostly for the price."
3,What Cuff ?!!,"happy with the shirt, but I thought I was buying a dress shirt that could wear my cuff links with. But the shirt is of good quality."
2,Low expectations for $5 shirt....,"...and they were met. The material is extremely thin, but fortunately, I live in Florida. I don't expect the shirt to hold up well, and I don't think that I will be purchasing any more of this brand, but for a $5 shirt, it is about what I would expect."
3,Great for the price:),"I only paid $5 for this shirt, if they had more in different colors I'd defiantly purchase it again. The shirt wrinkles coming out of the dryer, but if you remove it promptly and let it hang for a bit it doesn't have to be ironed. It is very thin, but a comfy shirt, my husband likes a T-shirt under it for winter."
5,Boomers! Get this album!,"Even if you are not a dedicated Fifth Dimension fan, you will love this album when you play it and discover the songs that you grew up with in the 60's and 70's. This collection will really take you back. The fidelity is as good as it can be considering how old the master tapes are. So what are you waiting for? Click on add to my shopping basket. You won't be disappointed."
5,Would you Like to Fly?,This is absolutely the greatest collection of Fifth Dimension works. It brings me back to my college days when I attended several of their concerts on campus. Anyone who followed the Motown beat is sure to love these albums.
5,Worth it,"As a collector of sometimes obscure singles, I went for this double CD to get ""Ashes to Ashes"" specifically. Saw The Fifth Dimension in concert at a state fair as a boy, and ""Ashes"" was their new song at the time. Great sound quality, fun liner notes. Recommended compilation of high value."
2,Not too watchable,"This movie was way overhyped on the product page... I could barely keep enough interest to see how it ended, and now I don't remember."
5,New Whitney Fan!!,"A great mix of gospel (incredibily inspiring) and heartful love songs. There are several ""cuts"" that I play over and over again. I am not necessarily a ""fan"" of gospel music...but they way she sung this entire CD was unbelievably inspirational. You Can Feel the spirit!! My favorite tune is ""I go to the rock""...it get's me going EVERY TIME.I listen to it often, over and over again. One of the best CD's I have!!!!"
3,"Nice uplifting songs, not my style, but Houston fan",Gave it a try being Whitney fan...but not my type of music with the large gospel church sound which does get a bit overproduced...will give movie a try.
5,The Preacher's Wife CD,"Sound quality was good. The music wasn't want I expected, but I enjoyed it as I had not seen the movie."
5,Recent Purchase,I purchased a CD (Preacher's Wife) - it was shipped on time. When it arrived it was in perfect condition. I was quite pleased with the service and the item.Thanks
5,EXCELLENT!!!,I think this is my favorite soundtrack of any movie and I own lots of soundtracks! I love each and every song on this CD. I first got this CD back in 1996 when it was on cassette and listened to my cassette until it barely played. I think this CD is a work of art that Whitney can never touch this is absolutely her best work ever! If you like Whitney or gospel or even both you will love this CD!
5,A voice for any season,"This is probably the most exciting album Whitney has ever recorded. Many critics were saying that she doesn't sing like she use to: However, anyone who listens to that crystal clear voice on the original version of ""I believe in You and Me"" would say that the critics are WRONG. The album is a ""feel-good"" for anytime of the year. My personal favorites are ""I Love the LORD & My Heart is Calling"". Her mother also does an excellent job with the 23RD Psalms (W/ Hezekiah Walker's choir). I would reccommend this album for anyone looking for peace and happiness.I'm convinced that we still have not seen or heard the best work Whitney has to offer.Enjoy"
5,W-O-N-D-E-R-F-U-L,"This CD is another of Whitney's greats. She got to take it back home to the church where she came from and her heart still is. ""I Love the Lord"" is just heartwarming just as the rest of her songs. You will also get the chance {for all those that don't know}to hear her mom on here. Alot of the unchurched love this CD also. THE MOVIE WAS NOT BAD EITHER!"
5,her best recording,"Whitney Houston was beginning to have some vocal problems at the time she recorded this album. She could no onger belt at her old intensity and to be honest acting in a movie by day and singing at night do not work. When Whitney is on she is great , when off oy vey, Here her middle and lower registers kick in as she ings gsospel music, pop and my favorite ballad of all I Believe in You And me. She never sounded more human or real than on that somg"
3,Preachers Wife,"I loved the movie, and ordered this for the song, Imagine a King,well, for that one song it was great, but all the other songs weren't whatI liked."
5,Great price and delivery services!,The soundtrack by Whitney Houston - The Preacher's Wife - Original Soundtrack CD - I ordered this CD for my sister and she has been enjoying great music ever since.
4,Heavenly and Food for the soul!!!,"In this album, Whitney has shown us that God really is the center of her life as I have heard in her interviews with MTV and The Oprah Winfrey Show. The songs in this soundtrack are very heavenly. As always she has shown us her powerful voice and indeed she is a DIVA! Keep it up Whitney!"
5,My Favorite,"I have owned this CD for many years. I pull it out at Christmas as well as when I want to hear something inspiriational. For Christmas it is joyful and prayerful. When you are down, it will lift you up and remind you that you are never alone. The voices that praise God on this CD are truly incredible. Whitney Houston...Her voice is like no other! RIP"
4,Everything for Somebody,"This is Whitney's well-deserved attempt to try and make an album that is everything - Gospel, R&B, Adult Contemporary, and CHRISTMAS! And unexpectedly, she succeeds. Somehow, the CD manages to stay coherent and purposeful even with these mish-mashed together. Perhaps it is because even the Adult Contemporary are still ""spiritually"" inspiring, and the Christmas songs seem to flow well with the Gospel songs included. Whitney has never sounded better. Highlights are ""I Believe in You and Me"", ""Step by Step"", ""I Go to the Rock"", ""You Were Loved"", and a rousing rendition of ""I Love the Lord."" The closing ""Joy to the World"" will make you wanna dance. This is a great CD - and one that Whitney has a passion for. The only thing that would give it 5 stars,is that if next, she went for something all the way. Maybe a completely Gospel album or Christmas album."
2,Preachers Wife Soundtrack,"Even tho I loved the movie, I was rather disappointed in the CD, as it is not what I would call a Sountrack. There are a few songs I don't recall from the movie, and the ones that she sang on the CD, were not as they were in the move. For example---Who would imagine a King---She sang this with the Childrens choir in the movie, and alone on the CD. She sang about three or four songs with the adult choir, and only heard them once on the CD and that was at the end. For a soundtrack, I would not recommend it. It should have just been called a Christmas Album."
3,Chart Gospel,"I guess Whitney succeeded in having Gospel music crossing borders and reaching listeners that normally wouldn't give a hoot about this type of music.Sure, her name on the cd cover is a guarantee, but she was coy enough to match this genre along with some more chart-friendly stuff as I BELIEVE IN YOU AND ME (being the movie version far superior than Foster's produced one) and STEP BY STEP - written and backed up by Annie Lennox - and YOU WERE LOVED (first track written for her by Diane Warren, that unfortunately sounds too much like Celine's BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME).Plus, the whole collection is the soundtrack to Whitney's third movie role.Lots of movie goers just bought it expecting a second BODYGUARD...Sorry to diaappoint..this is total different stuff.Good for the holiday seasons..."
3,It's Ok!,"I am not a big fan of Gospel music, the only reason for purchasing this album is for the Whitney Houston tracks. I was a fan of the songs ""I Believe In You & Me"" and ""Step By Step"". I didn't care for the movie, but the soundtrack wasn't all that bad. Whitney does sing the Christmas songs great. She should of released her own Christmas album, following this album. But she waited years later and that might be a reason why it flopped. Hopefully Whitney can get back to her roots and continue to sing with her beautiful voice."
2,it is done whitney is finally with jesus amen,for those whitney fans who wanna hear her explore her gospel roots even though she was heavily addicted to crack cocaine when she made this album and the film but hey if anybody did'nt think whitney was an cult member think again she sure had ya'll fooled with that jesus con game but hey guess if you wanna suceed you have to play the jesus con game to fool the public while secretly serving satan.
5,Underated classic rock.,"Great recording,just as I remember it. Montrose comes back with a reformed band and puts out a very tasteful ""hard rock"" effort. In my opinon,this is one of his best. Of course it's hard to top his debut recording with Sammy Hagar on vocals. But this one has a slightly different approach. Jim Alcivar's keyboards are definately an asset to the band. What's great about this type of recording;not overplayed,i.e.on the radio. In fact never heard it on air.""Matriarch"": ""KIller Tune"".Yeah Baby!!!!"
4,Greatest hits? Not quite,"I like a lot of the stuff this group put out. And some of it - well, we won't go into that.The CD is very enjoyable to listen to, it has all the Thompson Twins hits and some that, unless you were listening to alternative stations, you will not have heard or heard of.I wonder what they would be putting out today if they were still around? Something to think about."
3,The Good and The Schlocky,"The Thompson Twins had some great tunes that were both quirky and beautiful. However, they also did some stuff that is very high on the cheese factor. I had to wonder if some of this stuff was Phil Collins rejects, esp. Nothing In Common, Get That Love and Long Goodbye. And tunes like We Are Detective and You Take Me Up rate high on the cornball scale. That said, I do love the quirkiness of Love On Your Side and In The Name of Love, the beautiful If You Were Here, the romanticism of Hold Me Now, Lay Your Hands On Me and King For A Day. This isn't a bad collection, but I can think of a zillion eighties bands such as Til Tuesday, Missing Persons, Berlin, Human League and Book of Love who have a much better greatest hits catalogue."
1,typically boring,this story has the America F**K Yeah hero big man. The stereotype tough Russian (a paranoid relic from the cold war) chic side kick. the whole novel reads like the cover of national lampoons vacation DVD. The predator creatures could have been interchangeable with any easily dispatched villain. Am I supposed to believe that a hunter with 800 years of experience is that easily taken out by troglodyte with room temperate I.Q? I am sure this was written by a teenager.
3,Certainly readable,"Another trip into the world of Predators hunting on earth. This time a ship crash in the cold Russian tundra. Send in the salvage crew to retrieve technology, add a touch of Russian cold war paranoia, and a heat emitting station and you have the essential story for this book. Archer's second outing for the Predator franchise, while readable, isn't as enjoyable as the first. In this instance, I recommend the Dark Horse comics graphic novel over the book."
3,"Nice book, but I've read better","Cold War was a decent book, but it lacked alot of action. Most of the book is just people talking, with the exception of a few chapters. I haven't read the first book, Concrete Jungle, but I'm planning on it. I can't say that I have read the other predator books, but I have read all of the pred v.s. alien novels. I suggest if u like to read pred books and u enjoyed the alien movies, pick up alien v.s. predator PREY (Book 1). The first book is excellent, but the next 2 were about the same as this. Over all I enjoyed this book but I wish it had more action. PEACE OUT..."

3,it was alright,"I must say I was a little dissapionted. After reading so many good reviews i thought the book would be great. But, it was shy of action and weak charatcters except for Shacfer and the russian women."
3,Halfway Decent,"While it does do the Predator character justice, I have to say COLD WAR is my second-to-least favorite of the Aliens and Predator novels (1st is EARTH HIVE). As has been said before, the majority of the book is just people talking- Russians whispering off ""ice demons"", Americans spreading conspiracy theory, Schaefer (Arnie character's brother) being leveraged into going along with a mission to secure Predator technology. The dialogue is believable, but the pacing is off and the characters are horribly unlikable. I haven't read CONCRETE JUNGLE yet, but plan to and hope it's better than this."
4,The Ultimate,This compilation of Phyllis' songs take you through every emotion that she is feeling. Another phenom that was taken away from us too soon. RIP PHYLLIS - WE'RE STILL LIVING A WORLD OF CONFUSION.
5,Loved this CD,"I only recently heard of Phyllis Hyman. If you're just breaking up w/ someone, she might not be a good choice to listen to. You'll cry.:-)"
5,Phyllis Hyman,"My favorite Phyliss Hyman Album which has a number of songs that I never get tired of listenting to while driving an in traffic and were one can see her exceptional talent, artistry, and beauty as a female Jass and Rhythm/Blues Singer who died tragically of suicide over 10 years ago.Nestor Mantilla"
5,Ms. Hyman was WAY before her time.....,"Some might say that I have an ""old soul"" for a 23 year old young lady. I grew up listening to Soul Sistas like Phyllis, Anita, Regina,Etta,Chaka and countless others that escape my brain. When I plopped in this CD for the very first time, I fell in love with it. I do suggest NOT to make the mistake that I did and listen to this CD while you are getting ready for a party or something like that. Phyllis can take you through an emotional rollercoaster... But that is why I love her. I am so disappointed that her demons got the best of her thus taking her own life. We would have more of this great music from legendary diva."
5,Timeless.....,"Great CD. I still find it hard to accept that she's gone forever. What a talented lady who left us much too soon. I remember so fondly, listening to the album, Somewhere in my Lifetime years ago and thinking how powerful Ms. Hyman's voice sounded. Damn........."
5,Birds of Idaho Field Guide,"I love the way this bird book is organized--by color,alphbetically.Maybe it is like the joke about the way women would organize a car lot, but I love being able to go the ""mostly black"" section, then the ""mostly blue and white"" section, then ""mostly blue"".......I can find the bird everytime.JGR"
2,"Nice intro, limited coverage","While this is a nicely organized and easy to use guide, it has so few birds in it that I would recommend almost anything else over it. If you're a rank beginner, you might find it useful. If you have ANY experience at all, don't bother."
4,This is a good book.,"We have used this book a lot. It is better than others which are not written for just Idaho. Birds vary from area to area and the same kind of bird might look different in Utah than it does in Idaho. Only problem is that it is not divided into any catagories except color so are hard to find,"
3,For collectors like me,"Note: I ordered the dvd Amazon identifies as ASIN: B0002KQO1M. It is not the item pictured which appears to be a 4 movie set including Cinema Of Vengeance. It is Toby Russell's movie about martial arts and action movies from the 1940s through the 1990s. The dvd cover is the blue one with Bruce Lee on it. The item picture is wrong, but the other Amazon details are correct. I had no problem playing this on my inexpensive Philips DVP3982.If you are into Asian action movies, this is a nice historical overview and clipfest. Major players in the industry offer their thoughts and there are plenty of historically important vintage video clips. Most of the video is old and not remastered or restored so don't expect high definition quality. Clips are from studios like Cheng Du, Great China, East Asia Film Co., etc. If you are a fan, you will appreciate the interviews with Lau Kar Leung, Jimmy Wang Yu, Yuen Woo Ping, Sammo Hung, Gordon Liu, Ti Lung, and more."
1,Cinema of Vengeance Wouldn't Play in My DVD as well,"I can't rate this film as well. This is the only commercial DVD that wouldn't play in my DVD. The Distributor was a company called Fortune 5 DVD and imprinted on the disc was VideoAsia. The DVD video box artwork was nicely done with more information then is usually available, all for nothing.I would avoid all Fortune 5 DVDs."
4,an in-depth study of hong kong cinema by one who knows,"UK born Toby Russel is considered an expert on HK cinema even in HK itself and his knowledge is put to great use in the documentaries he produces like this one and the ""Top Fighter"" series (recommended). Although fairly cheaply produced this doc contains many interesting clips and interviews with the stars from the famous to the not so famous. If yoy're interested in learning more about HK cinema then this is recommended and be sure to also check out the ""Top Fighter"" tapes as well."
1,"""Looks like the best in, ""Martial Arts,"" all in one history""","""Still unsure if it's any good, it wasn't capatible with my JVC-(DVD,VCR) or PS2. So, if you live in the United State and Want to view it, what seem to be the best of the new best. For kung-fu move collector, make sure it will be capatible with you system first, before buying. I know, you are welcome!"
4,Funner to do than it looks,"I was disappointed when I received it, as I was hoping there would be useful information there about Texas, like the state bird, state flower, famous old-timers that made Texas history, etc.But it was a delightful puzzle to do.There are many different colors and shapes and patterns, which made it more challenging,especially if I didn't look at the box to see where the pieces went.It is BIG, I had to turn it sideways to fit on my table (see photo).It's a keeper, for several more builds."
4,"""Chandler Writes Like A Slumming Angel""",I am a huge Chandler fan. I would have given this excellent collection of stories (and essay) 5 stars except for the atrocious number of typos! Totally ruins the flow of the story! I also wish that there was a linked table of contents.
3,Not a Phillip Marlowe mystery...,"I thought this was another Phillip Marlowe mystery, but it is actually an essay about writing mysteries, followed by a short story collection.The essay is enlightening, but Chandler mocks his fellow mystery writers a bit too much, in my humble opinion. I don't enjoy reading people put down their colleagues. (I have to admit, though, he did have some valid points.) Also, there are spoilers in his comments for those who haven't read the books he mentions.I guardedly recommend the short stories for Chandler fans. It's interesting to read the short stories so soon after reading the novels - you can definitely spot similarities, and it's easy to see how he could have used the short stories as a basis for his novels. If you're not a big Chandler fan or you've never read him, I wouldn't recommend starting with this one. For a fan, though, it's a must read."
1,"Wow, what a cheap piece of crap!","The silver work was extremely crude. There were barbs of silver on the seams of the mold. The stone looked like a cheap marble my kid bought at the super market; to make it just a bit worse...the ""marble"" was literally hot glued in place with globs of glue at the points where it is cemented to the silver. I honestly have seen better jewelry in my daughters Barbie play set. I wish they provided negative stars in this rating system because I would give this a negative five stars!"
4,Great songs...over and over and over...,"This soundtrack was really good, and Phil Collins did a great job, but it got really repetitive. I can only listen to ""Two Worlds"" in so many different variations (that aren't really that different anyway) a finite number of times. However, definitely worth buying, although it'd be nice if it had more songs."
4,A great listen!,"This is a wonderful soundtrack! The opening theme/sounds are more reminiscent of ""Last of the Mohicans"" than a Disney flick, and the songs are excellent - great rhythm, drums, vocals, etc. (Instrumental music more like ""Princess Bride"" in sound.) Phil Collins is fantastic - I could listen to him croon forever. Like everyone else, I think it's way too short (hence 4 stars). But worth it!"
5,What a great CD,"I thought that this CD was great. Phil Collins has a wonderful voice on all of the songs. The song ""Trashin' The Camp"" is still stuck in my head. Rosie O'Donnell does a wonderful job on it. Every song on this CD is great and I listen to it all the time."
4,excellent cd,"I loved all of the Phil Collins songs. The score was also very beautiful particularly track 10, but as someone else had mentioned in their review, it could have used a more African feel. I would have loved to hear a group like Ladysmith Black Mambazo doing some soft African chanting in the background, or something to give it a slightly more African feel. I really like the soundtracks that have some background singing in the background such as the case with most of James Horner's scores. This however is really a great CD and I'm sure it will be ten times more powerful when it's shown with the movie. By the way if you all like African music I would suggest the soundtracks to ""the power of one"", the rhythm of the pridelands cd, or the Lion King broadway cd."
4,Phil Collins--A perfect match to Walt Disney's Tarzan,I loved Phil Collin's contribution to this soundtrack. He comes back as strong as ever and hopefully he will follow this success with a new solo album soon.
4,Oscar-winning song not in my heart yet...,"...so I gotta hear the song ""You'll Be In My Heart"" as soon as possible. END."
5,Tarzan: Disney is the best (again),"Fabelous score, breathtaking songs. This is the only way I can expresse my feelings about Disney's release Tarzan. Beautiful ballads and hot jungle rythme, this soundtrack got it all. Disney has again the level it had when the soundtrack of the lion king was released. Powerful songs take you on a ride to a hidden jungle. The only thing you have to do is buy it and enjoy the Disney experience."
5,THIS MUSIC ROCKS,THE MUSIC FROM TARZAN IS THE BEST! IT WENT WITH THE MOVIE PERFECTLY.IT WAS SO GOOD NOT HAVING THOSE DISNEY CHARACTERS SINGING THEIR OWN SONGS!
5,great piece of music and it's in 5 languages!,"i really like this cd. also got the spanish version which sounds really nice too. anyone got the french one yet? would really like to have it, but you can't buy it here in germany. i really look forward to get the german one in november."
5,Excellent,"This is the best sountrack ever. The songs are beautiful. A lot of times when I buy a CD/cassette there is only one or two songs I like. But this is one of those rare cd's where I love each and every song. The music is beautiful. The songs are great, my kids love this too."
5,Amazing,"The Tarzan soundtrack and John McArthur's, ""Hidden"" are my two top favorite albums of all time! Phil Collins is at his best in lyrics and music. This is a must for young and old!"
4,Not everything I thought it would be...,"I admit that this is a very good CD, but I wanted more of the score, and less of the Phil Collins... Some of the most impressive music in the movie is not on this CD, leaving a lot to be desired..."
5,"Moves Like An Ape, Looks Like A Man, Sounds Like Another Hit For Walt Disney Pictures.","The soundtrack to Walt Disney Pictures' final film of the era known as the Disney Renaissance is nothing short of tree-swinging, howling, good, old-fashioned family fun. My favourite tracks are: ""Son Of Man,"" ""Strangers Like Me,"" ""Two Worlds,"" and of course, the Academy Award winning song ""You'll Be In My Heart."" If you loved the movie, you'll enjoy every second of this soundtrack. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH (Tarzan Yell)."
2,"Not bad, but not outstanding","I would say this album contains songs in the typical Phil Collins style. All soft without any outstanding performance. Sorry, Disney, but this is not the way to go!!! What happened to those great soundtracks like 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' and 'The Lion King' (by the way, if you want a good soundtrack, get the Lion King II album. Tom Snow should write more for Disney!). Disney should start to concentrate on quality again, instead of having a popular, all-star cast !!!"
1,The Soundtrack Hurts!,"except for 'Stranger's Like Me' this soundtrack sucks. None of the songs have any African rhythm or compositions to them, and Hans Zimmers sidekick- Mark Mancina's (Moll Flanders, Speed) score sounds like it belongs with 'Pacohantas' than 'Tarzan'."
3,Another Disney Wanabe,"I admit I was looking forward to this CD soundtrack since Mulan was so disappointing but must say it isn't that much better. The tunes, although catchy, simply don't take flight and become rather repetitive. A better exploration of some of the melodies would have provided a more interesting soundtrack. There is hardly any character involvement in the music.Unlike other Disney soundtracks which usually persuade mne to see the movie, this one left me with second thoughts. Buy this ablum only if you have a desire need for some new Disney music."
2,Yeesh,"While other artists like Brian May and Peter Gabriel have tackled serious and very good soundtracks (The Road Warrior, Passion) Phil Collins has turned out a silly and largly forgettable collaboration with Mark Marcina. Of cource its for a Disney film (an apparent indication of how low Phil can go)."
1,You Ruined It Phil!,"As an avid Disney fan with a wide musical taste, I find it quite easy to appreciate the value of most music. However, the songs ""you'll be in my heart"" and ""two worlds"" not only make me want to retch, but also show no particular compositional talent whatsoever, opposed to some of Disney's past memorable songs where it is quite evident. I fail to see why Phil Collins won an Oscar for his work. The rest of the songwriting that year must have been absolutely dire, not that this wasn't. If I was allowed to give a no-star rating I would and I will be praying that Collins is banned from taking on any more projects with companies that I once had a lot of respect for."
5,Great Job Disney!,"This movie was great and the CD was teriffic I didn't know Rosie could sing like that. She did a marvelous job. Phil Collins is always magnificent and he didn't let us down this time! The song of Rosie's is so much fun that it makes you want to dance. My neices, 14, 12, & 8, make me play it over and over in the car! (but I don't mind) If you haven't bought the CD, you must! It is worth every penny just for Rosie's song, and with Phil Collins you can't go wrong! This is the best $17.00 I've spent in a while! Thanks for listening!"
4,You'll be in my heart is the greatest song in this CD...,"Phil Collins is amazing... if it wasnt for him, I wouldnt buy this CD...although the movie is very touching... anyway, if you are a Phil Collins's fan, buy this CD!"
4,GREAT!!!,"Phil Collins, as always, has done a terrific job on this wonderful soundtrack. I've seen the movie twice and wouldn't hesitate to see it again. Beautiful!"
4,INCOMPLETE TV SERIES. THERE IS A COMPLETE SERIE AT AMAZON.CO.UK!!,The american version I've bought at amazon.com has only 15 episodes and it's very expensive. There is no special making of or something different like that. But I've bought the complete series (30 episodes)at AMAZON.CO.UK for less!!!
3,Somewhere between The Avengers and Mission Improbable,"Never suspenseful, clever, funny or credible, ""The Champions"" mixes never fully developed characters with interesting English settings. The 60's styles, cars and settings are nearly on par with the Emma Peel Avengers episodes but the story lines and characters are inferior. Danger Man and The Avengers would be a far better choice."
1,shame on you A&E people....,"is amazing how people who make or sell these excellent television programs neglect the international public. So for those who do not have English as their mother tongue, we have two options. 1. Do not buy the show or 2. buy it and try it to understand the best that can be.Incredible how other distributors such as Warner or international buenavista offered for sale series and movies in dvd format with audios and subtitles up to 8 different languages. Honestly I prefer to buy the titles from Warner, Buena Vista, Universal etc, and remember, although I do not live in the U.S., or my mother tongue it isn`t English, my money is as good as anybody, and I will spend it elsewhere."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I purchased not one but two separate copies of the DVD. When the DVD is inserted a caption reads ""input code, parental violation"". Huh?Both DVDs created the same problem for my late-model GE digital DVD. Called the distributor. Waste of time, they blamed my player. Yikes!"
2,Disappointing,I was disappointed that the socks were not very tight. No compression was in the feet area and what was in the calf was not as tight as other compression socks I've purchased in the past. I use compression socks while working 12 hour shifts and I usually can feel the difference when wearing them---my feet usually do not feel tired or in much pain but I cannot say the same for these.
5,Diverse,"This very diverse Alan Parsons is pure, so versatile a range of the spectrum of his music. A great listening to album."
5,Alan Parsons Rocks!,"Saw them in concert this year, this has all of the performed songs. Amazing quality as always!"
3,Partial Parsons,"Firstoff I rarely go with a ""greatest"" collection. Arbitrary choices seldom do a band justice . I feel this is also the case with this collection. I suppose someone unaquainted with Alan would have a reasonable overview of his production. However single songs plucked out of what are largely concept albums suffer out of context. That said I bought this compilation because there are no remasters currently & I hoped to have an idea of how a remastering treatment would fare. The sound is quite nice. So depending on your reasons for owning this work will be the impetus to buy."
4,"Indubitably, The Definitive Collection","I've seen and owned numerous AP collection albums that were outstanding. Without hesitation, this has to be the most complete AP collection there is. One day you will know where you are, remember!"
1,This is Definitely NOT APP,"If you were an Alan Parsons Project fan back in the 70's and 80's, the only thing you will NOT find in this 2 cd set is the original APP music.I bought this set today from a shopping mall and could hardly wait until i go to my car and put the cd in the car stereo.First track is ""I Robot"" (enstrumental), its so changed that i couldnt even recognize it.90% of the songs are NOT the originals i used to love back in the 70's.This is CHEAP ELEVATOR MUSIC. This can be anything but definately not Alan Parsons.I feel so cheated that first thing in the morning i will be returning it. And i will never buy a new APP cd again.Shame on you APP.I guess other reviewers either only wrote their comments by looking at the track listing or they are so young that they dont know the original APP music.If you love APP dont buy this set."
2,Highly technical,"Good treatment of the subject for specialists, but a book I like better is ""Unlocking the Value of Your Business"", which seems to produce the same bottom-line results, but faster and simpler."
4,Crescent City Cocktails and History,"This book provides a nice insight on old New Orleans and the impact its bars and barteneders had on the devlopment of some of America's classic cocktails. Most recipes are accopmanied by a bit of history of New Orleans and the orgin of each drink. It does a wonderful job of giving background and insight on the Sazerac, Mint Julep, and Ramos Gin Fizz...all of which are standard cocktails in the Big Easy and have earned their place as ""classic cocktails"". Imbibers who prefer some of the more modern drinks of our time may be a little confused or diaaspointed with the recipes in this book since they are truly ""old school'..many dating back to the turn of the century and pre-prohibition. Nonetheless, the history and colorful stories in this book will surely please anyone who is in love with the ""Old South"" and the Crescent City!"
4,Great pedal but...,"I like this pedal, but only for single coil/P-90 applications. It is a bit harsh and is better if it is mellowed out with stacked chips like the Monte Allums mod."
2,Merritt's Black Wheel,I'm a Merritt tragic & had to buy this book just to read the seven chapters written by Merritt himself...unfortunately the remaining 2/3rds written by Hannes Bok leave you struggling to engage. I don't know if Bok had any supporting notes to use to complete it...it seems he may not have...it leaves you with the feeling (certainty?) that if Merritt had finished it it would have been a classic up there with his White Road short story & some of the other darker tales that he wove together.Read Merritt's bio & you'll understand what I mean...ie its not just the idea but the execution & word usage that makes one story an authentic wonder & the next a far fetched yawn!It should be in your collection if you have everything else of Merritt's though...
5,ScreenClean LSd,The product is good and I like it. I will recommend to by this product to my friends.
5,Awesome,"I was using wet wipes for computer screens before, but they required a lot of effort to clean the screen. No more efforts! Monster works just fine. I just sprayed it on the provided cloth and wiped my monitor. It took less than 40 seconds to be done. There are some reviews that say it leaves streaks, but I think that it's because they apply the spray directly on the screen, not on the cloth. However, it's said on the instruction that it should be applied to the cloth."
4,Nice deal....but,"it appears that this set is geared more towards computers, vs. LCD tv screens....i've used it on my computer screen, and had good results...i've been a little hesitant to use it on my Samsung tv yet though!"
1,Product Rated 1 Star,"For me cleaning a Dell SP2309w lcd monitor screen with this product was a failure,product leaves streaks and made the screen look overall worse then before,just went out and purchased distilled water and isopropyl alcohol (50% by volume) and a spray bottle,my mixture is approx 40% alcohol & 60% distilled water,total cost was 3.27 - suggest you do the same(go to your local 99 cent store for these items)."
2,not doing the job,I bought this cleaner for my lcd TV and am not impressed. I followed the directions to a T and my TV is still dirty.
1,Leaves streaks on large LCD TVs,"Used on my large 47"" LCD TV. Product packaging says it is for LED TVs and I read the TV manual which didn't have any warnings about cleaners such as this type.It leaves large streaks on the TV. Seems okay on much smaller displays as you can wipe the product away before it dries to quickly."
4,Decent,"Decent product. Cleans but sometimes leaves smudges or streaks but may be the way I'm doing if. I've found after cleaning, a slightly damp rag is best to clean residue left by this cleaner."
1,Would not buy this product,"I purchased this product to clean a 32 inch Samsung TV and two relatively new Apple Thunderbolt displays. With the expectations of removing thumb prints, dust, and run of the mill streaks from the equipment. Spaying a fine mist of the product on one device at a time. Then using the provided towel to remove it after a gentle brushing. Well, it did more harm than good by leaving a fine film all over the screens. I will never used it again have not purchased any screen cleaners in fear of more of the same.After several months i was window cleaning using a squeegee. Well i tried it on the old Samsung TV after cleaning the squeegee and using a little Culligan water since it's filtered. It worked. It took a few times and it was not perfect but it was much improved. So i then tried it on the Apple Thunderbolts. Those turned out looking like new. The water just falls to the counter. No more Monster spray for me... ever!"
1,Don't do it,I found this book to have too many biblical references. And spanking is advocated. I don't recommend it to anyone for any reason.
1,Broke in a month,"This lens worked pretty well for a while, though I did have some trouble with soft photos, but that's not entirely unexpected given that its a Sigma (and the price). My issue was the damn thing broke in a month. It would only focus from 10ft to infinity, and then it wouldn't autofocus AT ALL and the manual focus ring remained locked between 10ft and infinity. I called Sigma and they said it would be 2-4 weeks before they could repair it! Even though it was still under warranty and I bought it less than a month ago! They said it was simply ""policy"" and there's nothing they could do for me. So basically I'm screwed because I use this lens everyday for my job, and now I guess I can't work for 2-4 F****ing weeks! DO NOT BUY THIS LENS! Sigma will screw you over and not give a damn about it."
1,Worst focusing I've seen,"I did only about 30 test shots with this before deciding to return it. Not one picture was in focus. I do know enough about depth-of-field to rule that out as the problem. Even at f/2.8, there should be some sharp feature somewhere within the focus rectangle in the viewfinder. There wasn't. Not even once. I've never had this problem with any other lens, ranging from expensive Nikkor primes and zooms to inexpensive Tamron ultrazooms. Lenses have to work, straight out of the box. This one didn't."
3,this is a good lens but,little disappointed in the overall sharpness and slow focus speed with this lens. It is a solid built lens but the zoom control was tight and not smooth on my Nikon D700/
3,was my favorite lens,"had this lens for 1.5 years and it was my favorite lens, i also have a 70-200 Sigma as well. about two months ago the autofocus locked up. i sent it to Sigma, they fixed it free under warranty which was nice (paid $25 shipping) and one week after getting it back I have the same issue. I do a lot of beach shoots. the lens does fog up quite often and i do get sand every where. kinda, 2nd guessing my purchase but it is half the price of the Nikon lens and it is very good quality glass and the pictures are sharp. it is also a very quiet lens. wish it had better seals, this might be the source of my issues."
4,Support Socks,Great fit and comfortable. What more do you need. get the 3 pack in different colors worth every cent. Get
5,Wonderful First Solo Album,"This CD is a great purchase for all types of music lovers. It has something for both the Top 40 crownd and the Adult Contemporary. It has already had two hit singles - So Help Me Girl and Superhero, and has atleast 2 more songs that have hit quality. Gary Barlow is the ex-lead singer to Take That, a British Boy Band that reached fantastic heights. Gary was both the lead singer and main song writer, and brings his experience and talents to this new album. I love it! END"
4,It's a pretty melodious CD.,"Gary Barlow has done a nice job on this album. He certainly used his previous experiences with 'Take That' to try not to make any mistakes. The songs are melodious but can't be heard more than once or twice. The songs 'Love won't wait' and 'Forever Love'are pleasing to the ears. However, Barlow needs to write other type of love songs since most of the songs have the same meanings. For a person who looks for good melodies and only slow love songs, this album is a good buy."
1,Complete outrage and anger,"sometimes this slagging of Gazzy makes me sick. he's more than proved himself with this album . he's very quiet, serios and sweet.i gave this album one star because i didn't know how to change to a 1,000,000 stars .OPEN road and the duet with Danny Mulryan with his georgous voice are the complete stand- outs. This album has changed music and now everyone is trying to copy him like robbie williams for example THERE IS ONLY ONE GARY BARLOW"
2,2,"don't get me wrong he has a beautiful voice but...his album was rather Boring. open road, i fall so deep and superhero were pretty good...the others were blah. the background music in some songs over powered his voice and became a babbering bit of nonsense. that is one of my major dislikes about the album."
1,good old gary,"he's sweet and kind and a role model i would like for my children. my wife even thinks he's brilliant. there's nothing i enjoy more than this album. who is the dark enigma which props up in this album. danny mulryan is an excellent backing singer and almost steals the album from gary. yes, i enjoyed open road the title track. i wish that he made into a 40minute epic so i wouldn't have to listen to the other tracks THE B-SIDE of that single should have been on the album"
2,Are you Serious?,"Someone was allowed to print a two star review of Nirvana's Nevermind claiming in all audacity that it was a retread of ""Open Road"". This album is the soundtrack of timidity and anyone who could hold this up as daring needs a checkup."
1,Gary Barlow HA HA,"Gary Barlow, formerly of Take That, I found it hilarious that you could mock The Bends by Radiohead. You were in a mainstream pop band and you are laughing at a great album by a spectacular band that is always expermenting. This Open Road album is not a piece of work, just another pop album. Gary Barlow, you and your friends Johnny Mac, get some real music taste, and maybe listen to your own album to see how bad it is."
5,Fine Adult Contemporary,"He has more than capable vocals for the music be does. If you like A.C. or romantic and emotionally passionate music, this CD is for you. He has great vocals throughout the entire album. He is a great songwriter as well."
5,Excellent for 2nd to 4th graders,"This is the best young Thesaurus we have found. It's organized similar to ""the big boys"" and is easy to read and use."
1,Journey to the Center of the Earth (1989),"Bad B movie. Emo Philips is in it for a very short walk on part, yet he gets top billing from Amazon which I think is misleading. The story line has huge gaps. How the movie gets to the final ending is a big mystery. It wasn't worth the $6.99, I paid for it in October, I see it has gone up to $13.49."
3,"Great outdoor scenes, and a good movie ........","Maybe this 1959 version did not have a big budget like the other version withPat Boone, but after seeing again, i was pleasently surprise but some ofthe caves and mountain scenes,,, as most of the movie is filmed in the greatoutdoors the movie moves along pretty good. Always fun to watch a differentversion of your favorite movie, and this one left me with a smile.Great for the whole family. Enjoy"
1,I wish I could give it zero stars,"Let me begin by saying that I love Japanese monster movies. I also love Dr. Who. In short, I am willing to adopt a frame of mind where I can enjoy almost anything. I especially love camp.But this was film was just too bad. I was never able to get into that suspended disbelief frame of mind that allows me to enjoy a campy movie. The result is that I have not had my intelligence insulted this much since I read the party platform of the Texas Republican Party. It was so bad that I could not make it past the first 20 minutes.Save your money and save your time. Avoid this movie like it was the plague.PeaceDavid Courtney"
1,It's Just Bad!!!!,This has got to be one of the top five worst movies of all time. They have some nerve using the same title as the classic Jules Vern movie (1959).My only recommendation is don't waste your time or money.
1,Awful Movie,Don't waste your time or money. This is an 80's B movie. The end is spliced together from another B movie the Alien from LA. Which makes no sense. The action scene that is on the cover is a dream sequence.
5,Journey to the Center of the Earth (1989),"I had a good experience with this purchase , It came in a timely manner and the quality was good .Thanks again Bill"
1,A movie that never ever should have been made,Do yourself a favor and pass on this movie it's lame and hardly resembles jules verne's book. The directors should be ashamed of this movie the actors should be ashamed of this movie it sucks.
1,Not worth the money,I've watched most the Journey to the Center of the Earth movies....this one.....not worth your time. It will be going to a garage sale or the Goodwill very soon.
1,CONFUSED LISTING?,"I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE. THE CONFLICT BELOW SHOULD BERESOLVED BEFORE YOU SEND FOR THIS MOVIE.BOTH THIS MOVIE ""JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH"" SHOWING MGM ON THE DVD BOX AND ANOTHER LISTED AS ""A FABULOUS JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH"" RELEASED BY CODE RED/NAVARRE APPEAR TO HAVE THESAME CAST AND DIRECTOR. HOWEVER THE PLOT DESCRIPTIONS SEEM TO BE FOR 2 DIFFERENT MOVIES. HAS A MISTAKE IN LISTING THESE MOVIES BEEN MADE. ARE THESE THE SAME MOVIE?ANOTHER REVIEWER INDICATES THE MGM RELEASE STARS EMO PHILLIPS AND THAT THE MOVIE IS NOT WHERE TIME BEGAN/THE FABULOUS JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH STARRING KENNETH MORE."
1,Waste,"I read every page of this book. It was a complete waste of my time and money. I'm asking for a refund. There was no detail that helped me. While I'm not a new testament kind of guy, I expected more from a ""Bible""."
1,J2EE 1.4 joke book,"The authors used J2EE 1.4 first beta as their reference, with current beta 2 release most chapters gone obsolete right away. The authors also forgot the point Weblogic and Websphere does not implement j2ee 1.4. This is an obsolete bible! The official release of j2ee 1.4 spec is 6 months away. Don't waste your money."
1,Pretty bad,This book was a pretty much waste of money and time. It was hard to follow and seem to be written by alot of of authors. Inconsistent. I get better book on J2EE in other books. It does not explain how to use J2EE as much as it explain most basic concept of J2EE. This I can get from most basic Web sites. Why I need this book? I can get this info from web sites. Not much value added. I wish I look at other books.
1,A bundle of obsolete JUNK,This book is based on J2EE 1.4 BETA 1. The API and code discussed in this book shows up with serious deprecation errors. You will be better of reading the latest J2EE 1.4 tutorial posted in the Java site than reading this obsolete junk.I saved your money.
1,Disappointing with obsolete code and content,"I am really disappointed with this book, which is outdated and obsolete in both both code and content. If you are an aspiring J2EE develper, then the content and code discussed book will lead you to a dead end. The code is mostly deprecated and just don't work. The content is obsolete by 2 revsions. The authors ignored lot of new features of J2EE..a long list to add here. You will be better of reading the J2EE 1.4 tutorial with examples posted in the Java site than reading this obsolete junk.SAVE YOUR MONEY."
5,Best J2EE book on the market!,This book was written by several members of the Java Community Process (JCP) and will have competitive advantage over books that are simply written by professional writers. It is jammed with information on the latest J2EE specifications and explains crucial concepts in a clear manner. This is the best J2EE book of the year.
5,Expertly written and easy to follow,"I'm relatively new to Java and J2EE, so this book was kind of like jumping in to the deep end. However, thanks to the authors' clear and concise writing style, I learned to swim pretty quickly in the new J2EE 1.4 pool! The size of the book was a bit daunting at first, but I decided to give it a go. I found the book really pulled the concepts together and presented them in a useful way.This isn't the first J2EE book I've read, but it is definitely the best I've come across so far. After finishing the book (which is well worn and dog-eared now!) I feel like I'm ready to tackle some of the new concepts in J2EE 1.4. I certainly won't be spending money on another 1.4 book in the forseeable future.My recommendation in a nutshell would be: buy it - you won't regret it if you're prepared to put the effort into reading it."
2,Poor picture quality.,"Unfortunately I have to agree with Dan. While an HD transfer might have been made, there has been no apparent attempt to restore the film. The quality of the colour is all right at times, but it's patchy and so poor in places that it looks as though it was shot with the 2-colour Technicolor process. The negative is clearly damaged in many places. What a shame."
1,Nothing new.....,"If you know nothing about Depeche Mode or the electronic music scene throughout the decades, this is a good documentary. If you already love DM and don't need random other people to tell you how great they are, stay away from this DVD. There are lots of interviews, but none with the band themselves. They only play snippets of a handful of videos - and they are all the usual suspects. There was some video of them performing but mostly we got still photographs of them through the years. I'd rather see them walking and talking, rather than posing for the cover of a teen magazine. Overall, not impressed. Buy the 101 DVD for a real documentary about the band."
4,Excellent video!,"This is a great video for anyone who is interested in learning more about or driving the Alaska highway. The video starts with the history of the Alaska Highway it shows some nice WWII era footage of highway construction. All the large towns that you'll cross between Dawson Creek, BC and Fairbanks, Alaska are reviewed. The video also contains some other footage of ""side trips"" that can be taken off the main highway which I found very imformative. The video of the scenery cannot be beat. I am even more excited about taking my own trip on the Alaska Highway after viewing the video!"
1,"Everybody join in to blow up ""that"" country","Battle Royal was one of the few good contemporary films to come out of Japan in decades(besides Godzilla). After watching an all too familiar twin towers toppling scene at the beginning, and the terrorist responsible making a moving speech at the end for several nations to start a war with us! I'd say the director of BR2 got a little side-tracked. This movie attempts to accomplish two things- glorify terrorism and slam America. If the director is going to be bold and accuse America, he needs to target the bribed polititions and corporations directly! not everyone in the U.S.! Riki Takauchi is talented at looking crazy while chewing on tic-tacs. BR2 is a rehash of the first film and a 911 fantasy from a director with his own extreme agenda."
1,Disappointment,"I was very disappointed int eh quality of the movie because it would constantly go out of sync, the movie would skip so far ahead and sometimes restart to the title screen. The cover wasn't as it was advertised and it felt like a waste of money."
1,Battle Royale Flush more like it.,"Battle Royale II takes all the substance out of what made the original so compelling ... the character studies, the story arc, the underlying social commentary.. and what have you... leaving a hokey... sci-fi channel movie production quality neck blowing up fest. Now that shouldn't be the worst thing ever... sacrificing story substance for cheese at least sounds like a fun time...case and point-Howard the Duck or Snakes on a Plane. but they sacrificed the fun too.... this movie is boring and every scene drags. This is a ""cash in"" film, and a horrible one at that. File with Weekend at Bernie's 2, Mannequin 2, American Psycho 2 (starring Mila Kunis of That 70s show), Beverly Hills Cop 3, Honey we shrunk ourselves, Secret of Nimh 2, The Neverending Story 2, The Ring 2,... you get the point... although Mannequin2 and Weekend at Bernie's 2 were easier to sit through."
3,Not as good,"This wasn't as good as the first. The first is way better. This one went too far off the story line into a whole other type of movie. I did not enjoy this as much as i enjoyed the first, but this is still a good movie."
3,So-so follow-up to a brilliant movie,"Three years after the failed BR program, Shuyu Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara) who was one of the 2 survivors of BR has became an international terrorist that began a legion of terrorists that are terrorizing some of the adults mainly in Japan to bring down the government that has created that program. Now there is a new act called Battle Royale program II where it has junior high students being trained by militants as they are sent to kill Shuyu to stop his terror as war begins.A so-so follow-up to one of the best Sci-fi movies of the last decade! i should say the original didn't need a sequel as much as the book didn't but the manga was quite cool for what is was. Unlike the first one which used social commentary fused with action, this one feels like a muddled mess and bad writing. Sonny Chiba who is a Japanese acting legend does an appearance but the film is an ok follow-up to a masterpiece."
1,Battle Royale II,"Unfortunately this sequel to the amazing cult classic doesn't stack up to the original at all. Despite the disappointing movie I was very pleased with the DVD itself. It comes in a well packaged case and there are plenty of extras on the DVD to keep you busy. The product itself was very good, I wish I could say the same for the movie."
2,Mixed bag,"It is difficult to think of a song whinier, and more unbearable than ""All By Myself,"" Carmen's huge 1976 hit single that took incessant self absorption to new heights. Granted no everything here is even close to as horrid, but that song's presence here serious undercuts to impact of this whole collection.With the short lived Raspberries Carmen proved he had a way with the kind of power pop hooks that are sorely missing in today's music climate. But unfortunately this collection draws too heavily from his subsequent solo career, and this section of the CD barely nets 3 or 4 listenable tracks."
5,Eric/Raspberries,"In my opinion, there is only one bad song from Eric Carmen and Raspberries, ""Hands On You."" But in a group or solo, he's the best. This album really makes you want a hell of alot more of him."
5,Great Greatest Hits Album!,"I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio and was exposed to Eric's music with the Raspberries. His music is pure rock n' roll with pop mixed in and fun lyrics that will make you smile. I bought the album mainly because a friend from California and I heard All By Myself on the radio. My friend called him a one-hit wonder and I objected! I bought this album because even I had forgotten just how many hits Eric recorded with the Raspberries and by himself. You will enjoy it as it has been in my car's CD player for six weeks!!!!"
5,Great stuff!,"Pay no attention to the self proclaimed rock historian that insisted that this collection is ""sappy"" and ""a waste"". This is great stuff! It honestly and accurately depicts the music of the time, and Carmen is a talented and creative singer/song writer. You'll enjoy it!!"
4,A okay CD,"i like Eric Carman. this CD has pop and rock ""n' roll. my favorite song are hungry eyes make me loose control all by myself change of heart.`"
5,eric carmen,"formerly of the raspberries.......his musical sense is incredible....aqnd his solo career was awesome.he wrote and sang ""never gonna fall in love again"" ""hungry eyes"" ""all by myself"" ""overnight sensation"" classic tunes that'll last forever........"
4,Definitively Eric Carmen,Was looking forward to listening to this from the time I ordered it.I was not disappointed.I've played songs that I had not heard for years again and again.Hoping to get my three 20 year olds interested in this CD as a diversion from some of the rubbish they listen to.
3,Good Sequel,"Not as bad as previous reviewers would have you think & the fullframe version is actually the edited version, whereas the widescreen letterboxed version is uncut. Worth a watch for Chiba/""StreetFighter"" fans."
1,bootleg,"Why is a bootleg release even allowable on amazon? Hopefully someday McCartney's videos are released on DVD, but don't spend money on unauthorized products like this."
2,Does not fit as advertised,"I tried to use this wrench on a nut 1 3/8"" and it was too big. This might work ok on larger sizes."
5,Images of the Arctic in transition,"This is a beautiful book filled with scores of stunning black and white photographs chronicaling Ulli Steltzer's travels through the Canadian Arctic. The photographs capture the everyday lives of the Inuit, showing us how past and present are at work in their lives, how these people who just decades before had lived in varying degrees of independence from ""modern civilization"" are struggling to adapt while retaining a sense of their traditions. While to book consists largely of photographs, included are numerous first-person statements (not exclusively by Inuit) discussing the losses, triumphs and struggles that the Inuit have endured."
1,Terrible editing/direction,"As the others have said, this book is terribly edited/written. The ideas and pictures are good, but often the text would directly contradict the pictures illustrating the point being made - picture says cut two, text says cut one, sewing directions are for something quite different altogether. I was very disappointed. Pictures say blow up 200%, but then don't blow up to the correct size (there are measurements on it as well). This is the third C & T book that I've bought that has not been edited. I won't be buying any more. At $16.95 they need to do better."
5,Flip Chart Markers,"The Sharpie Flip Chart Marker is an excellent product -- so much better than a dry erase marker when writing on flip charts. The Sharpie has virtually no odor, lasts a long time, and the bullet point makes writing/drawing easy.I plan on buying more in bulk. Unfortunately they come in a color pack in the stores. Some of the colors are useless for facilitating a meeting with flip charts, which is why I order black in bulk from Amazon."
3,"Interesting topic, but not a quick read","The author has researched well this game in 1966, but the writing leaves a little to be desired. I felt the author could have done a better job of caputring the players as charachters in the book rather than just topics of a history paper."
3,An Inspirational Read,"The Walls Came Tumbling Down is the true story of a group of men who changed the face of sport. Coach Adolph Rupp defied the status quo and changed the face of basketball by drafting five black players onto the 1965-66 Texas Western Miners, and then led that team to a championship.It's a story of the turbulent times and the social upheaval that inspired these men to take on the culture for the sake of the thing that mattered to them most-winning."
4,Do-be-do-be-do,"An informative and engaging account of the history of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. This is the sort of book that whets your appetite for more research and funding as well as for more information on the subject. I was particularly impressed with their style - clear, entertaining and thorough. It made me want to read more of their books, whatever the topic. A highly recommended book for folks interested in science but afraid of the math."
4,"Great spa, lousy lid","The spa is great and was an easy set up. The light is a nice touch. My only complaint with the spa is the lousy soft-cover lid. It fills with rain water and becomes a bowl. I will look to see if a hardcover is available. Otherwise, I will have to build a gazebo or some other cover. That is the only downside to this great spa."
3,The tub itself is pretty good but you need a hard cover!,"The tub is priced right and it does the job. 4 people do fit in it but its definitely crowded. It's very comfortable for two people. The biggest problem of this hot tub, which you'll have to deal with, is the soft cover. It doesn't work for rain or snow. A hard cover costs $400. You'll almost definite have to buy it."
5,The Most Selfless Love Story I've Ever Read!!,"This is the third time I've read this book and each time, I've fallen deeper and deeper in love with Connor d'Arcy. Are there any Connor's out there, I wonder? Caitlin O'Malley is truly a treasure as are Connor's brother's. The trials that Caitlin endures for her love of Connor is by far the most selfless act, that I can't find the words that can project my thoughts accurately. This book has the ability to take me to another time and place which many books so often do not. Being Irish, I can appreciate the suppression of the people and Uprising that takes place. But Irish or not, I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to fall in love or experience what it means to really be loved."
5,Good to the last page,"The first time I read Dark of the Moon, it was a book I found at my Aunt's house and it had no cover. I was bored so I started to read it. I never expected that it would turn out to be my favorite book of all times. It was beautifully written from beginning to end. When I first started reading it, I stayed up all night to finish it. I couldn't put it down. The characters are so well-rounded and the story is unforgettable. I've read mine so many times that the pages are starting to fall out, I am in the process of ordering a new copy. I encoourage all fans of TRUE romance to read this book. It won't dissappiont."
2,Sooo STUPID,"Okay, so the beginning was kind of promising. I mean, intriguing plot and all. And then the girl grows up and she becomes a real whiney, manipulative female, and altogether, a really lousy heroine. I got so sick and tired of it I gave up reading halfway through"
4,Couldn't put it down!,"I'll say it again - I simply couldn't put this one down! I enjoyed it tremendously. This one starts out different from most of the Robards books I have read (our heroine is disguised as a boy!). But the story draws you in almost immediately. These characters were more 'human' than most and the experiences that they have in this story are interesting and adventurous. There are times when you just don't know what will happen next! Caitlyn is a spunky, determined, and headstrong character one wants to relate to; and Connor is awe-inspiring. Karen Robards writes men just like romantic heros should be written! This book will make you wish you could go back in time and meet yourself a Connor!"
2,It is only just a Lil Bit,"50 Cent needs to decide if he wants to be tough or wants to be elementry. This song is very juvinille and 50 Cent needs to figure out some better rhymes. His full CD's are catchy, but he uses the same ryhmes over again. For example he has rhymed ""good"" with ""hood"" way to many times. This single is OK for the beat, but 50 Cent needs to decide to be real orgianal gangster rap or poppy. The rhymes aren't very good in this Single.I wouldn't bother buying this unless you are a big fan of pop music and 50 Cent.I hope this helpedCheers"
1,Needs a better Product Description,"I bought these gloves for my job seeing that they are for Fire and rescue, well These gloves are not NFPA appoved, not BBP resistant, and are not for fire fighting. I purchased an expensive gardening glove!! Save your money people! This product needs a better description. Had I not read the tag when I opened the box this could have a dangerous outcome! Thank you seller!"
2,Terrible quality.,I guess you get what you pay for. Used these only a few times on actual vehicle extrication and all the threads are coming out... bad quality. Stay away.
4,Bliss entangled,"In his third outing, New York police detective Lenny Bliss juggles two murders, both complicated by personal circumstances. The first is a ""floater,"" and his wife, Rachel, switching careers from stand-up comedy to crime writing, tags along, for atmosphere. But Bliss' own involvement in the murder of a rich slacker kid is enough to make his blood run cold. The security tape shows him entering the house the night of the murder and leaving 20 minutes later. But the security tape is missing.And we, the reader, know who has it. There are a lot of voices in this novel, but Sloan segues well, moving among thugs, illegal domestics, nasty rich folk, cops and criminals, mouthy kids, angry parents, worried parents, grieving parents and bystanders. Darkly humorous, with a hard edge and street-smarts, softened by deft characterizations and quirky writing, this is a mixed bag that works."
5,My FAVORITE Movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Okay, I can't even BEGIN to describe how great this movie is for anyone!! It is so funny, smart, cool, amazing, I love it!!And for about the 6 people in the world who haven't seen it, here's the scoop: It's all about Elle Woods, the cool, beautiful, president of her sorority, Delta Nu, and has the coolest and cutest boyfriend this side of, the USA. But when he dumps her to go to Harvard Law, it's up to Elle to get him back by....what else? Be a law student!!! This movie the greatest film that ever existed!!!!!"
5,My absolute favorite,"I absolutely LOVE this movie. It is just so fun and bright. I think Reese Witherspoon did an amazing job as Elle. Now I watch the movie anytime I just need a lift cause it always brightens my day, especially when Elle recieves her score for the LSAT's. I know thats hokey, but I always cheer for her at that part. I admire her character because of her complete openess to people and her genuine caring nature. I think that is something that many more people would benefit for having, and it is great to see an example of this in a movie."
4,reesse iz cute!,"ix onlyt sae this movie cause i'z thought that resse withersppn is cute, and she iz. i kinda liked the wayz she'z act. it wasz sorta on thewahat u called the funny side. near the end of thisz flick it doesn't seemt to go ojt o long. but it'z fun to wtach."
4,Funny Movie to Watch,"When it first came out in theatres, I thought it was going to be pretty stupid. But watching it on cable, I found it to be pretty funny. Reese's character was out of tune with reality until she applied herself in law school and used her beauty smarts to prove her client to be innocent. She was considered stupid and ignorant on the campus, but turned out to be one you can easily get along with. This movie was funny and entertaining."
4,"A light, funny movie.","This movie is not extremely deep but is very funny and enjoyable. Reece Witherspoon is, once again, very charming and funny in this light and funny comedy.If you want to have a good time I absolutely recommend this film."
3,Only in Hollywood!!,"A bimbo becoming a top lawyer: that's the premise here and a winsome Reese Witherspoon pulls it off in a charming way, which she would have to do to make this ludicrous story watchable.It's a bit on the feminist side with most men pictured as shallow but there are women pictured the same, too. In an era PC baloney, at least this film pokes fun at everyone, not just select groups.Witherspoon and Luke Wilson both play good, nice people and it's nice to see a Wilson brother NOT playing someone stupid. There are stupid parts in here, but you get that in any comedy. There are also some very clever lines in there, too, but overall it's pretty low-brained material.....just played for fun. It would have been more innocent without a needless off-key or profane remark here and there."
2,Legally Dumb!,"Beautiful Reese Witherspoon is the silly but highly-motivated title character in this by-the-numbers comedy. Witherspoon's star potentiol carries this stinker of a film pretty far. The female audience will surely get a kick out of this one. Reese gets to show that despite the fact that she is dismissed as an ""annoying bimbo with big breasts"" that she is actually a ""very smart annoying bimbo with big breasts"". This movie is far too cute and fluffy for my taste but if you're in to that type of stuff, knock yourself out."
2,Too fluffy,"I enjoy a great fluff movie as much as the next person, but this was just too over the top. This movie was just too cliche, had too many product placements (hello, Clinique) and was just full of too many holes. I know movies are full of holes, but these were just too big for me to overlook.One of the holes I had the biggest problem with was that she took the LSATs at the last minute and breezed through it, and then turned around and applied to law school. This all seemed to happen within a few weeks, and this is actually something that takes over six months to do. Since this was actually vital to the plot, I just had a hard time looking past it.If you want to see a good Reese Witherspoon movie, check out Election."
4,Charming And Fun To Watch,"This is a charming and fun movie. Reese Witherspoon carries the entire movie. She is very charismatic, intelligent, likeable and potentially a very good lawyer. The film was better than I thought it would be - that is always a good sign. Of course, Elle is stunningly beautiful with a wonderful quick mind. However, don't watch the sequel as the film has stretched reality about as far as it can be stretched without breaking the charm."
5,Blondes do have more fun,"This movie was a good escape from reality by allowing one ot laugh until they forgot about whatever bothered them. I play this whenever I am down or depressed, it always lifts my spirits."
1,terrible,the movie never played past 24 seconds when I was trying to watch it.. TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!!!!! NEVER by this product because it doesn't work and always freezes. Then it wont let you fast forward. Not even 1 second
1,It's all been done before!,"I guess when ""Clueless"" and ""American Pie"" became hits the teen movie industry went over-board. It's always the same story line and the same basic plot. You don't need a high IQ to watch this movie. How many times can film producers use the same basic plot line again and again!I found the movie boring, dull and to be quite frank would much rather go swimming with ""Jaws"" than watch that again!If you don't buy this movie, it will be one of the best decisions you could make!"
2,Not worth the $7,"'Legally Blonde' has its funny moments - moments where you burst out laughing at how incredibly stupid the situation is, which I guess is the point of the movie. It's fine if a movie wants to be over the top, but 'Legally Blonde' isn't over the top enough to be funny. Sometimes it takes itself seriously and other times you're supposed to laugh at the characters. The plot, of course, is entirely predictable and formulaic, and Luke Wilson's character is just boring.That's not to say you won't like the movie - the girls I went with liked it. Just be ready to suspend any sort of critical disbelief if you want to laugh."
2,"Very light, with a few laughs","Glad I recorded this from TV - now I an erase it. I almost turned it off a few times, while watching it, but stuck it out to the end. See it on TV or rent it, is my advice."
2,One Long Dumb Blond Joke,"This movie was stupid with a capital ""C."" It reminded me of the afterschool specials without a point. It didn't make me laugh out loud nor did the legal profession get this great boost of Elledom. Thank God I waited until it appeared on cable. I love Reese, but this movie sucked wind - what was the bunny suit about - oh my gosh I thought it was a costume party. Clueless was so much better than this - legally blond is a poor imitation. Superficial socialite and even dumber trial - this really leads me to believe that blonds do have more fun because had this been any other actress like a younger Sandra Bullock - her career would have been over. Wait a second, scratch that if it had been Nicole Kidman everyone would have been ""what was she thinking."" Reese is such a smart young lady and I feel that this movie made money because of her personality and her cuteness."
5,This was a really funny movie,I really like this movie!This was one of thefunniest movie i have seen latley.I wentand saw it 3 times and the people i took tosee it loved it too.!!:) :) :0
2,couldn't get into it,I did not like this movie at all. It just seemed too stupid for words. Don't waste your time.
3,Fun--but not strictly a no brainer,"Cases can hinge on haircare--and not everyone is as they seem. The film was mindless fun on one level, but teaches you really do need to look a little bit deeper sometimes.Clearly it's fantasy, but a lot of fun."
1,"Movie's Great, Amazon instant video's not.","I tried to purchase this to comply with my Amazon Instant Video app, but the movie refused to download for my daughter and Amazon charged me for it. Within 24 hours of purchasing, the video didn't show up in my app, and it never did after that. I then bought the second movie, which downloaded, and showed up in my app. I attempted to watch it, and the app crashed every two minutes during the movie. The downloading problem might have been unique to me, but the fact that I got charged for it was not pleasing. Although, besides the downloading issue, Amazon's great, but they need to fix the app to make it more enjoyable for everyone."
1,We rented for some friends visiting- yuk,This was rented to entertain friends with different tastes than ours- lets just say not what I would watch on my own!
4,Quircky film with a mix of fun while light on intelligence.,"Where do I start? The film starts off when Elle Woods, played by Reese Witherspoon, prepares for her date with the love of her life, Warner, believing that it will finally be the night he pops the big question. When he unexpectedly decides to break up, simply because he's going to Harvard, and he doesn't think Elle is very smart, Elle decides to go to law school too to win Warner back. But the tables turn when Elle finds out he already has a fiancee.Shortly: This film begins with a clueless type attitude and doesn't totally meet the hype the film has, but the humor eventually grows to be hilarious, and Reese Witherspoon turns out to be a total delight. While the film has a ""goofy"" everyday teen plot, this film is possibly one of the most charming comedies around. This film is definetely worth a gander."
3,Simple and sometimes funny,"This played out like a big fantasy. And sometimes there's nothign wrong with that and other times it seems like there is. Maybe it was the squealing men and women over this film, the envy of wanting to be blonde and all that stereotype connotes that added to my feelings of this film. I understand the whole blonde ""thing"" and there were points where this movie is funny. Do I think it's sequel worthy? No, not really. This one film spent so much time catering to Reese Witherspoon------who doesn't exactly thrill me as an actress here, thoguh she did in Election----that it was hard to get out of the bubblegum feeling about this whole thing. Sometimes bubblegum is too sticky"
5,GREAT MOVIE!,"My Favorite Movie!! Reese Witherspoon is a wonderful actress & this movie is so free spirited and fun loving! Ditzy I'd say (my kinda movie, hehehe!), and very Cute! It also shows how Ele didn't care what other people thought of her and she reached her dreams! She may have gone after them for the wrong reasons but it ended great! You like Reese you'll love this movie-a cute movie and a good laugh!"
2,A Poor Man's Clueless,"while Reese Witherspoon has some moments the film overall was bland&pure corny.I mean I don't get all the Hype it got.I found it just like so many other films that i have seen that have gone this route.I Prefer ""Clueless"" far better.that film stayed true to it's subject matter this one wanted to make it more Complex than it should have been."
1,Bad Fluff,"I was really excited about going to watch Legally Blonde the first time. Within 10 minutes, I was bored out of my mind and ready to sneak into another movie. But, I stuck it out. It was BOUND to get better right??? WRONG! The plot was completly predictable and unfunny. A blonde girl gets dump by boy. Goes after boy. Finds out boy isn't worth it. Finds a better boy and gains self-confidence. Blah, blah, blah. Throughout the whole movie, I didn't ""laugh-out-loud"" for one moment. There wasn't even a chuckle. Maybe at the Nail (or hair) salon, but it was a FORCED chuckle. I can never understand what all the hype was about. Just because Reese is adorable doesn't mean the movie is.P.S. I've seen Clueless and Bring It On ATLEAST 10 times each, so you know I know my fluff. This movie was just a disgrace."
1,Legally Stupid,"What was the point of making this? What was the plot? Did Hollywood have one of there ""stupid"" days again? This is a terrible movie. What more is there to say. Just terrible and stupid. (is that blonde enough?)"
1,People LIKED this movie?!!!!?,"I went and saw this with my friend because we had anready seen everything else. By the time the 20 minute mark came we were sitting with our arms in the air saying ""Why? Oh why did we waste our money?! WHHYYYY???"" (don't ask, we were hyper). I thought it might be cute but it didn't even manage to be stupid in a funny way (like Pearl Harbor). It was pure stupidity. And I understand it was supposed it be...but people liked it?!?! When it got to the ""Bend and snap!"" part me and my friend were sitting with our head in our hands wishing we had gone to see Moulin Rouge again for the millionth time. But alas the all sacred Moulin Rouge had been bumped by this dumb movie...ggrrr..."
3,Greatest Film in the History of the American Cinema?,"Once in a generation a film comes to open minds...(dramatic pause)...and change lives. OK, maybe not, but Legally Blonde wasn't too bad. Much better than I thought it was going to be and pretty funny in spots. I was impressed with Reese Witherspoon in Election and really liked her here, too. She seems to be a very good comic actress and I never realized she looked so good in a bikini--YOW! BABY'S ALL GROWNSED UP!"
2,Scenes cut out of Legally Blonde,"I love this movie and saw it in the theater when it first came out. I rented it from Amazon to show it to my kids and was very disappointed that it had been cut from the original. Some of the best scenes were missing!! Why? Still a great movie and my kids liked it, but disappointed that it was missing scenes...."
3,Pretty good.,This movie is good. Reese Witherspoon is such a good actress I love how she always has different personalities in every movie she does she looks different and every thing like this movie is good My grade over all (B-) Legally Blonde is rated PG-13 For Language and Sexual Refrences. There is some very strong mature Sexual Refrences
3,"Catchy title not quite ""Paper Chase""",An under achiever (stereotypical blond) played by Reese Witherspoon is dumped by her boyfriend that prefers to marry someone sophisticated and intelligent to further his career. The challenge is to retrieve her lost love at any cost; even if it means having to go law school.It goes down hill from there as the movie is formal and filled with clich√©s. There are some interesting side stories but not enough to save from the mediocre main plot. The outcome is not surprising but satisfying.
4,for once a comedy movie that's actually funny,"I thought this was a pretty good show. For what it's worth, I thought Reese Witherspoon's two ex-roommates from her fashion design school days were a little tiring. I also thought the moment when the accused killer reveals the truth as to where she was when the crime took place - actually having liposuction - was overdone a bit too. Once could also argue that the witness revealed her guilt too quickly once her lie was exposed on the stand by Reese, which is a black mark against the script. Overall, however, the movie works. It not only reinforces the message that people shouldn't be judged by their appearance or first impression, but also has several very funny moments. Personally I liked this show way more than Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles (3 laughs for the whole movie) or America's Sweethearts (no laughs at all).It was a nice change of pace to see a movie that did not rely heavily on profanity."
5,A Very Good Movie,"This movie was very good. My mom and I can quote the entire movie it is so good. Every time you watch it, you always find somthing new to laugh at that you don't catch the first time."
3,Funny PG-13 Flick,"Very clever movie that Reese Witherspoon does a great job in. Not recommended for younger kids due to some crude jokes, but definitely a fun movie for college-age and up who have been there."
5,This is such an awesome movie!!!,"Virtually unknown (until now) actress Reese Witherspoon shines in this comedy! Everyone who enjoys comedy, laughs, fairly clean fun, and blondes will adore this. I watched this movie a few months ago and have seen it 7 times since, even though I'm not a huge movie watcher. I would recommend this to anyone from the ages 10 to 85."
3,NOT PARTICULARLY COMPLEX ... BUT GOOD HOLSOME FUN,"Legally Blonde is not particularly complex, but is perfect escapism movie to get your mind off things and relax.The message here is ""Don't judge a book by its cover"". And we could all use a lesson in that. The outer shell is never the entire story when it comes to each individual person. Not only is REESE WITHERSPOON'S character an example of that, but everyone in the movie is. That's the best part about Legally Blonde. Reese's character is not what she appears to be on the surface and the producers don't stop there. Some characters are what they appear, and some surprise you.Although Legally Blonde isn't much better than average when it comes to movies, it does make its point in a fun and entertaining way."
5,Laughter is the Best Medicine For This Cancer Patient,"I'm not going to repeat what everyone else has said. I loved the movie personally, I needed a good laugh as I am undergoing treatment for breast cancer. I especially loved the chihuahua, and ,yes, I own a chihuahua, and now have ideas on apparel for him. It was just one of those movies that tickles you. If you could use a good laugh I highly recommend this movie."
2,"good movie, but why buy the DVD?",are you really going to watch this movie over and over again? i'm not sure it's worth 20 bucks to own it...
5,A Must See Movie,"Legally Blonde, staring Reese Witherspoon and Luke Wilson is a unique movie where a fashion-crazed ""Barbie"", or character Elle Woods, goes to Harvard law in seek of her ex-boyfriend to prove she can be more then a party girl, but a strict character as well. After arriving, a big surprise awaits her. With her new competition, will she get her man? This movie proves that blondes aren't ""dumb"", and shows that if you put your mind towards something, you are more then likely to succeed. As Elle Woods, Reese Witherspoon, proves her point in court, big changes are made. This is a must see movie, that all ages deemed appropriate should view."
4,Chickflick,"Elle(Reese Witherspoon) gets (get ready to scream) dumped by her Harvard-bound boyfriend, Warner(Matthew Davis). Determined to win him back, she enrolls to Harvard. She gets accepted and brings her little dog to Harvard with her. Nobody thinks she'll last, but she ends up taking on a huge Beverly Hills murder case and succeeds, she finds out how smart she really is. Luke Wilson also starrs, and Selma Blair starrs as her friend"
3,I'm going insane!,"Reese is ugly. Everyone in here is ugly. And her husband creeps me out! Sorry, I am haywire. This is a test."
5,The Best Movie,This Movie was the best!!! It's about a girl who go into harbort law school. Her boyfriend dumped her because he wanted someone smarter. See the movie to find if he wants her.
5,Beautiful Blonde,"My most beautiful blonde girlfriend and I went to see this movie ....We laughed practically throughout the whole movie and it helped us unwind and made us feel good, especially on a Friday night after work. This movie is about putting your mind to what you want to be able to achieve in life, especially if everyone doesn't believe in you and that you know you can do it. This is an excellent movie that everyone should see."
4,A great movie and a star turn for Reese Witherspoon,"Though comparisons to ""Clueless"" abound, this movie was indeed all about Reese. Despite success in smaller roles in movies such as ""Cruel Intentions"" she has never really gotten the same spotlight that has been afforded to other younger actresses.While not the most mentally challenging movie, the script of ""Legally Blonde"" not only gives her her first leading lady role, but a cute and inspirational story about starting out an underdog and ending up on top.Lots of great one-liners, a good supporting cast, the only weakness of the film (and my 4 vs. 5 star rating) is in the end.. a bit too contrived and cheeseball, but nonetheless a very entertaining movie. Saw it opening night and the theater was packed, and the whole audience seemed to enjoy it. Great summer movie."
2,"Not as funny as I thought it would be,but still OK","This movie was OK..it wasn't as funny as I thought it would be,though.i wouldn't bother to buy this movie-just rent it if you're curious.it's just about this bimbo girl who goes to law school to get her boy-friend back.it was kind of stupid.there were only a few funny parts(during the murder trial).Don't waste your money buying this-buy Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter or something!"
3,Good bad flick,"In spite of the fact that the plot makes no sense at all, and the characters are essentially cartoon figures, there are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments (especially involving the UPS delivery man, who steals the show!) Silly fluff, but a nice rental for a quiet evening at home with your sweetie....."
4,Surprising Good!!!!,"Don't let the previews fool you, this is a really good and smart movie! It's about a girl who goes to Harvard Law to impress her boyfriend, who in the end turns out to be a jerk and she meets a much nicer guy and ends up with him.When I first saw this movie, I'll admit I thought it was just another one of those teen movie that seems to be popping up everywhere now, but I was wrong, this is a movie the whole family can enjoy. I would give it five stars, but I DIDN'T like the whole soriorty girls stereotype this movie had. If someone watchs this movie they will think that all sorioryy girls are giggly, shallow airheads, that are into their apperances like Elle's soriorty sisters were. Being in a soriorty right now, I couldn't help but feel insulted. But, other then that this movie is really good and I highly recommmend it! You won't be disappointed!"
3,(3-1/2 stars) Kinda dumb at the beginning but it gets better,"Basically this movie starts out with Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) being the head of her sorority, a calendar model, and, well, ditzy. Her boyfriend is the very prestigious Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis), and things appear to be going fine between them until they go to dinner one night. Elle thinks he is going to pop the question, but instead he tells her he's leaving her because she's not excelled enough, so to speak, and then he goes to Harvard Law School. Surprisingly, she also gets accepted to Harvard Law, and she tries to pursue Warner while battling his new girl Vivian (Selma Blair), and the reputation that she's not smart enough to be there.This movie is better than most people think. It's more interesting than your average dumb-blonde-esque flick. It's not the BEST movie I've seen, but it IS pretty good."
4,Cute Piece of Escapist Fluff,"To ""Angelhrs"" in Washington, LIGHTEN UP! You are taking this movie WAY too seriously! This movie is cute and funny, (ESPECIALLY the joke about gay guys knowing designers and straight guys not), and no other actress could have pulled this off the way Reese Witherspoon does. She was PERFECT casting!""Angelhrs,"" your lack of spelling ability totally blew any credibility you might have had with me, and it's apparent that you wouldn't know what funny was if it bit you on the nose! Just because you happen to live in Washington, D.C. doesn't mean you can't have a sense of humor.To anyone who hasn't seen this movie, just ignore what ""Angelhrs"" has to say about it because if you put any stock in what SHE says, you'll be missing out on a cute, fun little movie. To those of you who HAVE already seen it, you know what I'm talking about."
3,Just an ok movie,"This movie is just ok. It is very corny, very pink, and very predictable. In fact, this film is almost entirely lacking in substance. Legally Blond was entertaining though, but in an EXTREMELY shallow way. When I was putting the movie back in the case, I thought to myself, ""Hmmm, I think I just wasted two hours of my life..."" but I didn't care because the movie made me laugh in a couple of scenes.It is very high-school oriented, and would probably make a great gift for a 15 year old. However, if you are over 25, I'd skip it all together."
3,"Same old plot, new hairdo.",Fish out of water gag wearing trendy clothes.She's pert & perky and platinum to boot. Reese does her job well and is very beguiling. However there is nothing original to see here. Not a bad way to waste 2 hours if there is nothing on TV.
3,blonde? yes ... hit? no,"As ""achievement"" movies go, this one was barely credible. The star keeps referring to people only treating her as ""a blonde with big boobs."" Well, her boobs were not that big- but she WAS a blonde. To think that she could change her personality and education level so quickly to pass the LSAT's, well ... you'd have to be blonde to like this show I suppose. ;)"
4,Light and fluffy...loved it!,"I am a 35-year-old teacher and I loved this movie! It was light, fluffy and wholesome! It is enjoyable and worth the money! Enjoy! I have watched it at least 100 times."
2,Sound is really bad,"The shipping and handling time was reasonable. The price was not bad to be a ""brand new"" movie, however, the audio is very poor. I had to turn my tv's volume up really high and still the audio wasn't good. Also, throughout the whole movie, the audio randomly goes on and off completely, this happens constantly."
4,"Cute, fun entertainment","Reese Witherspoon plays a lovable, confident blonde who in an attempt to gain back a love decides to get serious by going to Harvard. While she's their her unconventional methods set her appart, which has both its pros and cons in the hyper-serious world of law school. With decent acting and a heart warming story Legally Blonde is a fun movie to watch alone or with your kids. It has some light drama but mostly this is nothing but laughs. It's a very sweet movie that'll make you want to go tell your own girlfriend, (wife, significant other, etc.) how cute they are. Definately worth a watch this is a comedy worth seeing."
5,Hilarious and very original!!! Resse Witherspoon shines!!!,I really enjoyed this movie! I thought it was really hilarious and Resse Witherspoon played a great part in this movie. Nobody could have done it better than her! It definitely has you laughing from beginning to end and rooting for Elle every step of the way. It is definitely a movie I can watch over and over again!
5,I love this movie!,"Reese Witherspoon who plays Elle Woods in this movie plays a very good part! I think Reese is very nice!!! I like her outfits alot, they are really cool!!!!!! I think Warner is messed up alot , he needs to get fixed!!!!!!!!!!! I like Emmet, he is real nice."
5,A Wondeful Comic Delight,"Legally Blonde is a wonderful comic romp. It is full a great film for all ages alike. There isn't anything about this film that could be considered bad. The film is outstanding, and is funny all the way through. You'll leave the theater with a smile on your face, guarenteed!"
4,"Fun, fun, fun!","While the plot is more than a bit implausible, the movie is very cute. See this if you are depressed or otherwise just need a pick-me-up. I love Reese so much I could chew her up and swallow her!"
5,No blonde jokes last in this movie,"I loved this movie! It was great! ... We are always hearing about blonde jokes directed toward us, but in this movie the girl shows them all just how smart a blonde valley girl can be. Anyone who loves to see the little guy become the superstar needs to see this movie. Also all blondes need to see this movie because believe me this movie will instantly life your spirits and you will be able to forever shrug off all blonde insults."
1,Awful,"The DVD only played thru first 5 minutes of the movie. Then it stopped, I could go forward or skip scenes. What I thought was a good deal on an older movie was just a waste of money."
1,I have a problem,"When i put the cd, my dvd and all my friends dvds said, error region, i dont now what they mean, i nead asistance"
2,The real legally blond,"The real women who legally blond is based on was from Maryland and sued the university when they wouldn't let her hang a confederate flag up outside the window of her dormitory. its sad that someone who is obnoxious as that is making money off the selling of her ""story"""
3,"Witherspoon is cute, BUT ...","Reese Witherspoon is very winning in the role of a ""Malibu Barbie"" who goes to Harvard, but, as The New Yorker puts it, the movie quickly ""declines into low-grade farce."" Several so-called jokes aren't funny at all, but simply crude, a point parents may want to keep in mind. ""Clueless"" is a MUCH stronger film."
3,"Reese Witherspoon was hottt, but other than that........","Well,, I can't really say my opinion on whether I liked this or not. Reese looked just as great as always, and, well, I guess it was kinda funny. There were some funny lines & scenes, like ""Cause I'm too BLONDE?""- lol. Worth watching for once, but I don't think it's somethin I'd wanna see again. I wish they could've put the music video for that song ""Perfect Day"" after the credits- Hoku is soooo hot"
2,DVD contains more information than you'd ever want,"A slight but entertaining movie somewhat in the vein of Miss Congeniality for its intellectual depth, but maybe not quite as funny. The double-sided DVD contains much more commentary and information than any normal human could stand to absorb, but if I were a student looking to learn about the movie industry this would be a good place to start.For some reason, either the transfer to disc or the original print has strangely saturated colors that had me scrambling to adjust the color, tint, brightness and contrast on my television until I gave up and decided the effect, which I didn't like at all, may have been intentional, although the cinematographer's audio commentary didn't mention it.People who live in Massachusetts may find the cheesy attempts to use locations in Pasadena to pass for Cambridge to be the most entertaining aspect of this film."
4,Surprisingly entertaining and hilarious,"Reese Witherspoon shines in this flick about a silly blonde going to Harvard Law School. I really enjoyed the characters, plot, soundtrack and background shots. Not everyone will love it, but it's a definite win."
3,Making an Implausible Story Real...,"...is what Reese Witherspoon is capable of doing. Forget the far-fetched premise here: the story of an airheaded Valley Girl type gaining admission to Harvard in order to pursue a career in law with the initial reason being to win her boyfriend back is laughable. But the charm, charisma, and genuine honesty and believability that Reese Witherspoon conveys here and, for that matter, everything else I've seen her in makes this movie worth checking out. I loved her in Freeway, Pleasantville, Cruel Intentions, and Election. She can be funny, serious, genuine, and warm, which is alot more than I can say for her counterparts who attempt and fail at the same style, namely Kirsten Dunst, and Melissa Joan Hart. If you like Reese Witherspoon, don't miss this. Otherwise, you may find the premise foolish."
3,Let's All Feel Good,"Barbie gets a brain transplant and a new hot pink wardrobe. And, oh yes, goes off to Harvard Law Scool in pursuit of an ungrateful yuppie boyfriend. After the first ten minutes the remainder becomes transparently predictable, but never boring, thanks to Reese Witherspoon who grins winningly through thick and thin. Critiquing a movie like this is pointless. Like cotton candy and Disneyland, it exists in a world of its own with little or no relation to reality. I would have liked the result better had the stereotypes not been crafted by the numbers, as though political correctness can suffice for social conscience. It can't, not even when promoting the worthy cause of feminist empowerment. And somebody should be slapped hard for slotting in the manicurist in such condescending style. Still, pretty, perky Witherspoon glows, making this saccharine bon-bon an easy if lumpy swallow."
3,Entertaining,"Yes, this is a typical ""chick flick."" However, take it with a grain of common sense. This movie shows how blond and beautiful can be discriminated against just like any one else. With a predictable plot, you can watch with one eye open and still guess the end by the time you're thirty minutes into the movie. I give it 3 stars because it kept me amused and I enjoyed the diversion."
3,Slightly better than previous records,"This is surely an improvement for SAXON, after albums like the obnoxious ROCK THE NATIONS, FOREVER FREE and SOLID BALLS OF ROCK. Anyway, we still can hear glimpses of utterly awful and mean pop metal songs like ""Hold On"". On the positive side, SAXON tried a lot of differente ideas here. Some worked, some not. It's an album worth to have, if you're a Saxon fan."
1,Save your money...,"This TINY book with a BIG TYPEFACE is a genuine, prosperity-preacher's, pentecostalism-gone-mad rip off. Though it contains some truth, it really should be bundled with the other volumes in the Ephesians series. That way I'd only have wasted my money once instead of six times. Could have been named ""Six pillows from Ephesians""."
2,ok,"These aren't too bad. Great peanut taste but tasted stale. Wonder if it was because when I received them the ""Best Buy"" date to eat them was February 07 and I purchased and received them in September 07."
5,Great Product,"This is a durable pedal that will serve any acoustic player well... you can use it to go direct to a PA system or channel it through a typical guitar amp without needing an ""acoustic"" amplifier. It serves me well due to not needing chorus or reverb pedals and the anti feedback function can come in very handy... when you play a lot of different types of gigs, versatility is key and this pedal will give you exactly that."
2,Would have been nice if it had actually fit.,"The shirt looked good, only problem was that it didn't fit. I ordered an XL and I have a medium muscular build, but the shirt was way too small. I could barely squeeze into it."
4,"Action, humor, nostalgia","My sister and I recorded this movie when it came on TV years ago and watched it over and over and over. There are some great one-liners (e.g. the shopkeeper's rant about armadillos) and the characters are likeable. Boy, does this movie ever take me back to my teen years!"
5,"Want a copy! The story, the music. Fantastic!",Sure would like a copy of this movie. Absolutely fantastic. I see something I missed everytime I see it. The music is great too! Unfortunately I only have a mono copy. I want a stereo copy.
5,BAND OF THE HAND,eXCELLANT MOVIE FROM BEGINNING TO END. SHOWS WITH A LITTLE EFFORT CHANGES CAN BE MADE.
4,very fun markers,"Wish these markers were more widely available. Fun for coloring and also great for writing and revealing ""secret messages""!"
5,sissy-rock at it's best,"These songs are at once cynical, hilarious, heartfelt, satiric...and NERDCORE all the way! Like learning a new language, you'll never be able to say ""hummous and tabouli"" without saying ""and babba ganoush and RICECAKES RICECAKES RICECAKES!""..."
5,Nice CD,"I bought this as a gift,as I allready have one.Didn't realize how hard it is to come by these days.Glad I was able to buy it here.It is a very good cd,by a local band here.It was shipped quickly and in perfect condition"
5,Mr. G's Latest Record Album,"Very pleasant. Excellent. Surprisingly much better than expected. Mr. G. has come out with a semi-country-Beatle-influenced album, finely blended in Mr. G's own blender, coming out with the original Andrew Gold sound. Andrew, my hat's off to you.....and, if you haven't yet picked up your own copy, hurry while supplies last. John Mitten"
4,Andrew Stevens is a riot! - Cute movie for a Saturday afternoon!,"Okay, so I have a soft spot for Andrew Stevens. He's such a hot guy and he's been in some great 80's movies. I remembered seeing this on the shelf of my local video store and wanting to see it but never got around to it...until now.Stella Stevens (his mom) directed it and it really is a cute little movie. It's just fun and has some silly moments. Love the twins that visit the Wild Rose Ranch. They were hysterical. Andrew Stevens shows a comical side here. Too bad he didn't do more comedies. He really was good at playing the poor guy that keeps getting knocked down. Of course, in the end, it all comes together.Very light-hearted and family-friendly movie! Not even sure why it is rated PG-13. There is nothing offensive in it at all. I don't even think there was any harsh language. I'm glad I bought it. It's one of those movies you can watch on a rainy afternoon and have fun with."
4,nice tree,This item was well packaged and arrived safely and would still look great had my roommate remembered to water it. It's coming back though which speaks well for the trees general health.
1,diseased plant,Plant showed up about a week after ordering and was covered in a white fungus or mold.. I don't know what to do about it and I don't want to put it near my other plants. I bought it from 9greenbox and I contacted them but am waiting to hear back from them.. The tree does not look like the photo at all and is in a pot that seems way too small for the tree. The tree seems rather weak looking in terms of health and beauty.. I was looking forward to it and was hoping I would get the brussels tree from brussels because the last bonsai I had bought was actually from them and was a great plant.. Do not buy from this seller if you are looking to get the brussels tree..
2,Frostbitten,"It was cold when the plant was delivered, don't know how long it sat outside or on the truck, but must have gotten frozen during transport, leaves shriveled and dropped and now the plant looks dead. I will hold on to it for a while to see if it revives."
5,Bonsai.....Tree in a tray.,I've been doing Bonsai for many years...Even had a business for a few years.This is a nice tree. I have been familiar with the company for over 15 yearsI guess. This is my first order from them and I'm happy.
3,"Pretty good, but not pest free.","The tree came very well packaged and in fair condition considering it had just been in a box for a few days. However, after further inspection, I discovered that it not only had sow bugs and a baby millipede in the soil, it also had a minor case of spider mites. Although I took care of this fairly easily with some soapy water and a spray bottle, I felt a little ripped off that I just bought a tree with that many pests crawling around. It took a little longer to get rid of the bugs in the soil, since i had to just grab and kill them when I saw them. However, the tree still fared well and is still going very nicely 5 months later. I would say it was definitely worth it even considering the bugs."
4,Cute little tree!,"This was given to me at Christmas. It arrived packaged well and included a short instruction pamplet. I was weary about placing it outside in the cold, but so far it has done well. I do move it into my garage if it stays below freezing for several days. Otherwise, I take some pinestraw and sort of ""box it in"" to provide some insulation. The weather here has been crazy lately; 40 one day, 70 two days later, so my tree has been steadily putting on new leaves. So far, no pests that I can see. I think that this tree will be easy to maintain and will bring enjoyment for many years."
5,Wonderful Bonsai,"This little plant came in very quickly and was not damaged by the cold, cold weather whatsoever. It is rapidly getting leaves now (in Central Florida) and it is healthy and happy! Thank you - I will get more bonsai from Brussel's!"
4,Chinese Elm,I am very happy with this product. I ordered it two days ago and it has already arrived. I was slightly shocked that I didn't realize it was an outdoor bonsai but that's not a problem for me.
3,"Fast shipping, good price for mediocre tree","Pros:-FAST delivery, I ordered this with the free shipping on a Monday morning and it arrived Wednesday afternoon of the same week-The packaging was well designed as the tree experienced no physical signs of trauma (despite dents in the box)-Already looks like a bonsai if you aren't familiar with themCons:-Lots of scaring-Positions of branches will need work-Poor groomingIn summary, if you know nothing about bonsai but want to own one, this tree is perfect for you! If, however, you have an eye for the art, you may be disappointed; you get what you pay for."
5,Beautiful!,I received this tree only 3 days after I ordered it! It's beautiful! It has a nice fat trunk and looks exactly like the picture. It shows no signs of insects or disease. It came in a good quality pot. I'm sure I'll have this tree for a long time.
3,"Good bonsai, seen some mistreatment","The bonsai arrived very quickly and packaged very well. The bonsai itself is a very healthy tree and exactly as described. I have only one major issue with this purchase. During the process of training the bonsai to shape the trunk and branches typically you will use wire to encourage the tree to grow in a specific manner. This bonsai was trained to the Nejikan style. However, I noticed that three wire rings were still on the tree and quite rusted to the point I missed them originally. I was able to remove the old wiring, but the tree had begun to grow around the wire it had been there so long and rust rings were left on the trunk.Again this is a great little bonsai, but I would think hard about buying another bonsai online simply because you don't get to appraise the bonsai with your own hands and eyes."
3,less then impressed!!,I was very dissappointed because despite all the positive reviews my plant was subpar... It took a week to ship dispite online tracking status saying it had been shipped.. It slightly resembles the online photo..it came really dirty which I can forgive but the pot was in bad condition. I really get sad when I look at it. BTW I have ordered other bonsai online...but it doesnt always workout
3,needs to be outside,"Item came in good shape and was packed well. However, be aware this is an outdoor plant. I thought when you order a bonsai it is usually for indoor decoration but the instructions say it is to be left outside. Hope you have the weather and irrigation for this or your plant will die as ours did."
2,Chinese Elm Bosai,"i was pleased with the plant itself - - BUT the vase was in a thousand little pcs! would cost to much to send back - I replanted, but not looking as good"
3,nice,Nice but could have been better did not look like I thought it was going to look like could have been trimmed more to look like a bonsai tree
5,bonsai,"We purchased the the Chinese Elm bonsai through Amazon and were very pleased with the tree itself, and that it arrived very quickly after purchase. Very impressive - I will definitely be a return customer!"
5,Just like the Picture!!!!,"My Bonsai was shipped the morning after I bought it and I received it a day later. It came perfectly packed, there was not even a single leaf or soil residue inside the box. The Bonsai looks EXACTLY like the picture, the only difference was the pot; mine was rectangular, although it is the same color as the one pictured. It has tiny leaves growing and it looks perfectly healthy. I'm really happy with this purchase, I will be buying again from this seller and I encourage you to buy from them as well."
3,Packaging of the Bonsai Tree,"I ordered this Bonsai Tree for my boyfriend as a Valentine's Day present. Upon receiving it I open the box and it is packed with styrofoam popcorn and the top of the tree is all exposed wasn't wrapped at all. The container it was in had plastic wrap on it I guess to keep the moisture in, thank goodness. The bark on the tree is falling off, but maybe this is normal. I just hope the tree makes it.... Maybe the packing could be a little better!!!"
1,Looks dead,"Wondering if it will liven up in spring. If not it was a total waste of money. The pot it was shipped in does not hold water. Water leaks out all over table until I realized. So far, not happy"
1,dead and without a single leaf on it when it arrived!,"I just recieved my Bonsai tree, it looks more like a dead stick jamed into a crappy little container. When I opened the package the tree didn't have a single leaf on it and appears to be completly dead. Don't waste your money!"
1,dying dying dead,I bought three of these to give as xmas presents. They all arrived with brown leaves falling off daily as I hoped the shock would ware off in the week before xmas. More leaves just brown and fall off daily. What a waste off money. Off I go to buy three new gifts.
2,Cheap and will not last,This is no bargain. Its really poor quality. The sound volume changes on its own. Pay a few bucks more and get a quality product.
3,"I'd still buy it, nevertheless...","There are a few things about the product that could have stopped me from buying it.- Bear in mind you have to open the MP3 Player's container lid, turn it on, then close it (not the easiest thing to do), and after you're done listening, redo the process to turn it off inside. You don't really operate your player through the Shower Radio. The mirror's switch MP3/Radio/Off is not exactly a switch off. It's just something one can guess, but it is better to warn it before the purchase.- The mirror does blur a little.- The built in light is not strong enough.All these things said, I would still buy it, it's not too expensive, and it is really nice to listen to your music while bathing. BTW, I use it with a Creative MuVo."
5,Cheesy Goodness,"I only bought because the ""Xena"" guys were involved. ""Xena"" was cheesy, campy and fun, and I was hoping this would be too - and it is! I'm not even sure how I came across it, but have since bought three more copies for two guy friends and one bi girl. NOT for your average woman, unless she's into women or open minded. I'm both, so I loved it. Nice female bonding scene in the trailer too (bow chicka bowbow)"
3,If you give Bitch Slap a chance...,"If you get past the first 45 minutes, it becomes totally watchable. The movie was advertised as a Spoof of B-movies. Its more B-movie than spoof. I stopped watching the film about 45 minutes in but picked up again the following day.There are some good points. The fight scenes between the main characters are really well choregraphed. Someone definitely did their homework. The dialogue too between the main trio of characters gets much better towards the end of the movie and has some really funny points. The ending isnt bad either, sort of a Usual Suspects thing.The unrated version I watched could easily have been ""R"" almost ""PG"" if not for some of the violence. All in all at least a 3 star , maybe 3 1/2"
3,Ok movie,I only bought this movie because of Lucy and Renee.I'm glad it was only 5.00. Would not have paid full price for this.
3,"Bitch Slap - Unrated, and untalented.","If you were looking for a Death Proof esque female empowerment movie... Don't look here.If you were looking for Zoe Bell... she makes an un credited cameo - not worth it.If you want a stupid movie with a ton of fully clothed lesbian make out scenes... This is the movie for you.It is free streaming on Netflix right now... I wish I would have known that before purchasing the DVD.Have a bunch of guys (or lesbians) over and watch it while drinking - and whatever you do, do not dedicate full attention to this film... I am almost sure it will deminish your ability to think."
5,This is the greatest movie ever made!,"It's like the writers of this movie sat down over a couple beers and created a checklist of everything good in the world and fit it all into one movie.Scantily clad women? Check.B-Movie acting and special effects? Check.Water fight in the desert? Check.Midgets with assault rifles? Check.Ninjas? Check.Bad-ass cars? Check.Machineguns, swords and explosions? Check.Lesbian love scene? Check.Over the top action? Check.Awesomely bad? Check.The DVD that will get the most replay? Check."
2,Slap me...,"...for renting this. I admit, I was looking for some cheap thrills here. This movie could have been funny, and it could have been sexy. It was almost sexy. The girl with the lighter hair and the best ""beautiful when ticked off"" look was unbelievably attractive. I'm ashamed to admit that when I pause a clip, it's usually not a close up of a face, but she was that beautiful. I would be half tempted to let her slap me around in real life to get the chance to stare at her across a table at an intimate outdoor cafe for a little while. But I digress. The plot tries to be more sophistocated than it really is with lots of flashbacks, filling in some of the blanks,and answering the ""how did it all come to this?"" question posed by one of the girls in the first scene. The unrated version might have more blood, but not more skin. I give it two stars because any girl I would let beat me up has to be worth more than one."
1,But 5 Stars for Crap!,"Lesbian movie? Yes, if you're a straight male. Think over-the-top explosions and physical violence, and double that. Oh, and I meant mindless, meaningless violence. Stupid attempt to portray the 3 girls as lesbians but is as believable as everything else in this movie. Lucy Lawless is advertised but actually has a 5-minute throw-away role as a nun covered in traditional long habit, disappointing. I don't want to trade this in and ruin my rep; perhaps I could toss it out as I pass that abandoned Gulf station..."
2,Exactly what the trailer puts it off to be,I remember seeing a trailer for this movie a while back and stumbled upon it when searching for movies. Let me break the movie down for you.Scantily clad women+Guns+Water=Bitch SlapEverything else about this movie is horrible. I ended up fast forwarding through the majority of the movie to get to the end. Very dissapointed
1,Ummm... what was that supposed to be?,"I knew it was gonna be bad when I ordered it, I was looking for something stupid to watch, something B movie-ish. I was a bit confused who the targeted audience was: lesbian octagon fighters, horny teenage boys, James Bond novel readers, etc.I don't know, maybe that was the point. It was making fun of all of those things, but it was not so good. Cheesy, but not good cheese."
3,Kill Bill meets a Wendy O film.,"I have to tell you this comes off as a bad low budget Quintan Taratino film. I bought it because a friend of mine told me that Michael Hurst had a good role in it, and Kevin Sorbo had a small role too....After seeing this...I don't know what to call it, I have only one thing to say; I better not hear anyone give Bruce Campbell crud about his films ever again.Great film to give a husband or boyfriend that gets off on girl on girl action."
3,"Not horrible, and kind of enjoyable","If you're interested in the least in Bitch Slap, then chances are that you already know what you're in for. A ridiculous throwback to the grindhouse/exploitation films of yesteryear, Bitch Slap is gleefully bad in terms of many of its aspects, but purposely so. Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, and America Olivo star as a trio of buxom badass babes who find themselves in a world of hurt. The film's story doesn't really add up or amount to much, but that is really inconsequential in the full extent of things. There's a lot of terrible green screen use and dumb plot twists, but if you're watching Bitch Slap, such things are pretty much unimportant. What's really funny however is seeing Hercules and Xena vets Kevin Sorbo, Michael Hurst, Lucy Lawless, Renee O'Connor, and Zoe Bell in small roles."
3,I'm too old for this,"To keep my Kevin Sorbo collection complete, I recently bought this.I'm too old for this movie - I assume he did it to work with Michael Hurst and Lucy Lawless again; surely he cant need the money.It's brash, irreverent, extremely violent, definitely un-pc, full of lesbian action, swearing that would make a fishwife turn pale and I hated every minute of it - but I know some twenty-somethings who'd love me to give it to them. One of those chances you take - should've had a clue from the title. And he's only in it for about seven minutes. Of. well"
1,fair warning-for ages between 5 and 12.,"I buy anything with promising females on cover so this is how flick ended in my collection. One visible future in this eahh.. for kids is excessive violence mostly by females aganst males, well, as long as it balanced with something sinister I dont mind but it exactly what was avoided at all cost--any hint on sexuality. When watching I asked myself numerous times--Ok, chicks look sexy whats next. Next never happened."
1,save your $,Save your money on this one folks!! There are plenty of good movies out there to watch. A waste of my time.
4,Good Sound,"Product is accurately described. Works well for our purposes (gospel music and hymns at a nursing home). Allows a greater variety of guitar sounds when using only an amplified acoustic guitar, chording with with some transitional notes or finger picking. Good value at Amazon's price of $79.00"
3,NOT TOO BAD,"This film has sentimental value for me since it is the first soft core movie I saw Cinemax a couple of years ago. It keeps popping up again so it must be popular. Not nearly as good as other Cinmax mainstays such as Femalien I and II, Alien Files, and Virtual Encounters I and II, but still well worth watching; most of the girls never appeared in other pictures; thank goodness that's true for Tony Bond too."
1,For Die-hard Fans Only--Get the DVD instead,"I was disappointed with the sound quality and song selections. Most of Dusty's best songs were relegated to a medley, and a sloppily-sung one at that. The disco-era tunes were probably lively ones to watch, probably with backing dancers and fun stage antics, but on the audio cd, it all comes out sounding like the tapes I made during the '70s by setting my portable cassette recorder next to the television set. Save your money."
4,IBM THINKPAD T43,"In my other reviews I can't say enough good things about the IBM ThinkPad. The T43 is an awesome machine. Very tough and smooth. The screen is very plush and worth the money. I've used Dell,HP,Gateway,Compaq,Sony and pretty much every kind there is, but I've always had a love for the ThinkPad. The touchpad, the reconizable red pointer, and scroll button are so convenient. Much more durable than the Dell. The material use is much better quality than the Dell,or HP. No issues with this at all. The only down side is that it runs Windows. But that can be changed. T43 is worth the price. You pay for quality. I've dropped my ThinkPad many times and no cracks or anything. My old Dell on the other hand is a different story. Also doesn't get as hot as the HP."
1,IBM-Lenovo,"I have owned over 4 laptops now and the IBM thinkpad is by far the cheapest and most unreliable laptop. The computer has been unuseable every 4 months. First the battery. Then the power source. Then the harddrive. And now the motherboard, which by-the-way, has to be sent in to be replaced. It will take approximately 2 weeks to get all that back to me. I suggest a Mac or Toshiba. Their parts are not made in China, Mexico, and Malaysia like IBM-Lenovo's parts. I should have never taken the advice of PC magazine. THey do not rate on reliability."
1,False Advertizing!!!!,The add said that it was a Deluxe Rope Hammock with Stand what I got was a string hammock not rope and no stand.
3,Some essential (and key) tracks are missing,"A Bruce compilation cannot be titled as 'Essential' when some key songs are absent; to name but a few: 'Bobby Jean' (perhaps the center piece of 'Born in the U.S.A.) 'Better Days' (the best song from 'Human Touch' and 'Lucky Town' period), 'It's hard to be a saint in the city' (both essential and influential for other artists, such as David Bowie!!), 'Murder Incorparated', 'Point Blank', 'Racing in the street'. A far better choice for 'The River' would be the 'Live 1975-85' version.Despite this, the track selection is strong enough for those who do not know the impressive Springsteen career. Consider how difficult is to select only 160 minutes of Springsteen music (this is the silly restriction imposed onto creativity and music quality by this kind of compilations)."
4,buy it; don't buy it,I bought it because the sound is great. Everything's been remastered. But I kinda reget buying it because now Sony's next step will be to remaster Bruce's entire catalog forcing many of us to buy his stuff all over again. They did the same with Dylan; but man those discs sound incredible.Docked a notch for not having:Growing UpCandy's Roomtoo many songs missing form Born in the USATenth Avenue Freeze OutProve It All Nightand so on...
2,Bruce Springsteen----nothing more than an overhyped bar band!,"Oooh boy! This is what you end up with when a bunch of blue collar, working class, average Joes get together and try to make music...some of the flattest, most musically amateurish tunes ever released! Most of their songs sound like a bunch of blue collar slobs banging out their tunes at the local bar on Saturday night. Everything they play sounds very flat, noisy, and musically amateurish----a racket really. None of the band members are good at their instruments, and Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band are no different from any of the hundreds of other blue collar bar bands in the USA, except Bruce just had more hype! Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band----I think you guys should either learn to play and sing, or just call it a day. Leave music to the professionals!"
1,Beware!!! Corporate Sellout!,"I'll have to admit that I don't know much about Bruce Springsteen. So when I saw this for sale at Walmart, I put the ""Essential Linda Ronstadt"" down that i was going to buy my mom for mother's day and grabbed this for myself instead. From the first track I was loving it! I thought this man is truly a talent and couldn't wait to see how he had matured as a songwriter by the third disc. Sadly I didn't get that far, and by the second half of disc one I realized that ""The Boss"" had done like so many other....he sold out! Just like Pink Floyd had done with ""Dark Side Of The Moon,"" Springcan'tsing was making generic bottom-line-only music. Its sad to think what he could have been."
5,Much better than the 1995 Greatest Hits,"Finally, the Springsteen catalog gets an appropriate Greatest Hits Treatment.Two discs of great stuff, and a third full of great rarities for the hard core fans among us. Well worth the investment."
2,Hits and Misses,"Like countless other fans, I bought this for the bonus disc. But bonus is perhaps too generous a word. Forty-seven minutes and twenty-one seconds? Better than nothing, I suppose, and there are some gems, like ""Trapped,"" ""Viva Las Vegas,"" and ""County Fair."" But considering the incredible wealth of material still not released by Mr. Springsteen, the disc fell fall short of expectations. Where are older rarities like ""Richfield Whistle,"" ""Sugarland,"" and ""Don't Back Down""? Or, for that matter, newer live treasures like ""The Promise""? Any fan could easily have filled the remaining thirty-three minutes with superb material, so why couldn't Columbia Records?As for discs one and two, Mr. Springsteen said it best: ""depends on who's doing the listening."" How do you fit a thirty-plus year career into one hundred and sixty minutes? To their credit, at least these discs are relatively full. If I really want a best of, I'll make it myself."
4,Great singer !,i like it so much......down by the river.....i could listen to it so many time....those records give us a broad perspective on the work of this great American singer.....
4,ALL ESSENTIAL?,THESE TYPES OF RECORDINGS ARE PUT TOGETHER FOR ONE REASON....BE THANKFUL FOR DISC 3...THANKS BRUCE!!!P.S. ITS ALL ESSENTIAL.
3,Techmarcom's review - my thoughts/additions,"Regarding Techmarcom's review: as a long time die hard fan also, I generally agree with most of the points made. I will buy this cd for the 3rd bonus cd also, and will probably never listen to the first 2 as I aleady have them in other forms. I also have many of the disc 3 songs in other forms, too.But the one point that Techmarcom makes that I have to chime in on is the point that this cd is not really made for the long time or ""die hard"" fans. I think that, generally, these discs are NOT intended for us long time/die hard fans who have all these songs on disc already (or at least most of the songs). But instead, the discs are mainly a good gift idea for friends and family of these die hards - people that you want to introduce Bruce's music to and need a starting point to do so. For this purpose alone (and only), these ""Greatest Hits"" type cds are a great idea."
3,Too many holes in this collection!!!,"This fails as a super retrospective because, just like the original Greatest Hits CD, it leaves off too many key songs!!! Backstreets,Tenth Avenue Freeze Out, I'm On Fire,I'm Goin' Down,She's The One,My Hometown,Caddilac Ranch and many others are not to be found on this collection!!! 5 Stars for the music,1 star for the collection!!!"
4,Essential to both junkies and newbies...,"This is a good album. For curious listeners who are new to The Boss, or those who have listened to his music over the years but never got to add him to their musical library, this is a defnitive collection for you. For die-hard fans like myself, you will enjoy the digital remastering; those old songs do sound better. Everyone will enjoy the bonus disc, which for me had one surprise, the song Lift Me Up. Bruce sounds unbelievable using that falsetto voice for the whole duration of the song. I gave it four stars because some of my favorites are not on there, like ""Further On Up the Road"", ""Leap of Faith"", ""Growing Up"", ""Tougher Than the Rest"", ""Point Blank"", and many songs from ""Born in the USA""...and that's just to mention a few. Then again, it's impossible to please everyone. Get this album; you will not be disappointed."
3,Not Exactly Essential,"While this collection includes most of Springsteen's classics, several important ones are missing (My Hometown, I'm On Fire, Better Days, Secret Garden, Waitin' On A Sunny Day). It does however include some songs from his first two albums, which I would not call ""essential."" If they are going to call a collection THE Essential, then it should include every top 40 single the artist has released to date. This album does not do that."
2,Bruce becomes all he said he wasn't,"short & sweeta SHAME to see this X-mas release, never thought I'd say it but I long for the days when I waited 2 years or longer for a release (besides it built on the anticipation and in turn the Joy of his Brill' earlier work)Three Hits/collection/compilation packagesIs Bruce gathering as much wealth as possible for fear he will never have another ""Rising"" in him ?as I saidA Shame........"
1,what a disappointment!,"When I heard that Bruce had a new 3CD ""essential"" collection, I thought it would probably have all the hits ... I couldn't have been more wrong! Way too many songs have been omitted, most notably Pink Cadillac. If you already have his Greatest Hits CD, don't waste your money on this."
1,E$$ential Bruce? Why?,Bruce has become all the things he didn't like about Rock & Roll.MONEY- If you are a Bruce Fan you already have most of these songs if you are not you are not going to pay for old songs that you didn't like when they came out.But their are a few that must have ever CD Bruce put out well this is for you... Bruce thanks you for all of your hard earned cash again and again and again. IMPEACH BRUCE REMEBER SHEA!
3,A CONSERVATIVE SPRINGSTEEN FAN,"Let me say about Sprinsteen's politics, I do not agree with them in the least. However, he is NOT like Linda Ronstadt, Steve Earle, or certain members of the Hollywood left who HATE America (Woody Harrelson, Jessica Lange etc), those people are on my boycott list. I will not listen to music like ""41 Shots"" cause I find them offensive, but this CD is ok for fellow conservatives to listen to. What is wrong with it, is not having ""10th Avenue Freeze Out"" and ""Pink Cadillac"" on it, which makes me deduct 2 stars."
1,Bad Service,"I am amazed that you send me this review as i have not even received my parcel ,I was promised a refund which i am still waiting for,I am trying to get hold of anyone at Amazon to lodged my complain but it has fallen on deaf ears never will i purchase anything not even a safety pi"
5,best ones out there!,"I used many cheap magnifiers for fly fishing. They all have issues. This one is a class above them. This has a 100% reliable stainless steel clip for the hat. The cheep plastic ones can ruin a trip if they break, and they do. They are pricey, but the construction and materials justify the higher price."
2,The color is different than the one I received.,"It is not a big deal but how hard to update the picture these days.Hope it works with the HP thin client.8/30It doesn't work properly with HP Thin Client, it is very hard to believe..."
5,Brilliant,"This very short book is just full on great facts regarding America's beginning. Separation of Church and State is addressed, as well as our founding father's beliefs. A very good book for a beginner's guide into true American history. Very good for those who went to public school like me and got the twisted, misleading version of American history."
5,Good Read,Gives a great background on the Christian principles of the founding of our country. Everyone should read.
5,America's Godly Heritage,"This book was an excellent legal reference that did not require time consuming hours to digest the context. It is quick and easy to read with primary weight to contemplate. The Constitution is reviewed in small parts to more easily understand the different facets. David Barton is an fantastic author, that makes complex areas of litigation easier to determine an individuals distinction with morality and the statutes that allow or disallow the implicit reasoning or explicit action."
5,Inspirational!!,"This book was an inspiration. It taught me things that I either had forgotten or was never taught in school. I think every American should own a collection of books about our true American Heritage. Schools today don't seem to be teaching the WHOLE truth about our Nation's history. I have read this book with my children who are teenagers now, and there was so much in the book that has not been covered in their schools which are suppose to be teaching our children about American History! We need to continue to carry the truth about our heritage onto our children and grandchildren, so we don't lose who we are as a nation, as Americans! This book is a great start to doing this and a great addition to your American history collection."
5,Truth about God's place in American History,"David Barton stands out as one of the foremost proponents of Christian values in public school. He is trying to educate those of us educated in public school in those times when God intervened in American history in the lives of the founding fathers. He gives much insight as to the true intent they had in the Constitution of the United States of American and what it should stand for. All of God's people ought to be ashamed to have been asleep in 1962 when God started being systematically removed from our schools and public places. Thank you David for leading the charge, even if there are not too many of us that feel the way you do. God Bless you."
5,"Lies from Public Education, Now the Truth!","This book is a must read! This is truly where our nation built the foundation to becoming the most sought after place to live. Liberal leaders are destroying the very foundation of the truly God given principles for laws, truth and morality. If the U.S. continues down the path, we are doomed. There needs to be a repentance of thinking of self and a return to humility and seeking God to be our guide. Look at the financial mess of 2008, all due to greed!"
3,Not that great,"These Dragon Tales are not nearly as good as the newer kids' videos like Dora, Diego and Backyardigans. They have good messages but I found the voices a bit irritating. The Spanish soundtrack has some translation errors--not that it isn't correct Spanish but that I think the original meaning of some phrases was misunderstood. It wasn't as good as I had hoped."
4,I Can Relate,I just finished this book and really enjoyed it. I found it amazing that so many of Ms. Pattison's experiences in life and in corporate America are very similar to mine.
2,Expected more,"I was so excited to get this book--only to be disappointed. Most everything in the book I either already knew, or was REALLY common sense. This mom wishes she would have got it from the library. I could've saved money on the internet that way! ha ha"
2,Nothing new and/or exciting.........,"Good reference for someone just starting out.......but is not a definite ""must have."" You can spend very little time on the internet to find the same and MUCH MORE information for free. I was very disappointed to learn I had already signed up for the same sites mentioned in the book and have been a member for at least 5-6 years on those sites."
2,No new information,"I checked this book out at the library and was glad I did so, rather than purchasing it. I already do everything in the book, so there was nothing new for me to learn. I was somewhat disappointed.I will say that it is a decent reference for those who are just starting out. If you have a bit of time though, you can find a lot of this stuff just browsing the internet."
2,Mom's Guide to Earning and Saving Thousands on the Internet,There was not a lot of new information in the book. Most of it was stuff that can be found with just a little research.
5,Thank you Rosemary,Thanks for your great contribution to all OT who are concerned with our profession theoretical background. Thanks for your simplicity in doing it... Thanks to help me understand what I'm doing... Thanks...
4,Seems durable so far,Seems to be of decent/good quality. But I've only had it for about 2 months. Can't give it 5 stars until I see how long it lasts.
3,Hoping for something more substantial,"Well made, guess I just had different expectations.I'm not sure that I like the new required minimum number of words for the reviews."
2,Not quite,"I was disappointed by the quality of this production year of Thera-band Black. I do my ""rehab"" exercises every day and the band broke within three weeks - and then again within five days. This deterioration of quality make the product really not worth the money."
5,"functional, durable","I use it to rehab my weak ankles. Silver is perfect for athletes who regained full functionality in their ankles but needs rehab work to prevent future injuries. put the band around your foot and do sets of turning in, turning out, dorsi-flexing, plantar-flexing, in addition to your usual ankle routine. I've used it for 3 months, no problems so far"
5,"Made in USA, good build quality",We bought some Sunex brand one before and it started flexing so much we had to return it and buy this OTC one from Amazon. It seems to be very hardy. Everything is a little bit thicker.
1,Waste of time and money.,Poor quality poster that looks like a print of a print. Flimsy packaging used to ship the item so the container was bent which left creases all over the poster. The seller is aware of this as numerous buyers have complained about this problem in the feedback section. The seller is does not communicate. I tried to contact them three times through email and a phone call...no luck.
5,Great poster,Great poster. True to description and arrived on time with no damage. I bought a black frame and it hangs in my office. I would recommend to a friend.
3,ehh,"I love this movie, so this poster was a must. I ordered it with the EZ hang thing, and IT DIDNT COME WITTH IT. It cost me about ten dollars more or something!"
5,Great poster,"The poster came quick, in protective packaging and looks great on my wall. It makes the room look less like an office. Great buy!"
4,Love Pocket Folders,"I have been using pocket folders in my work (human resources) since the early 1990's. They are extremely useful because you can see the top page of the folder and it keeps all of your papers securely, unlike manilla folders. It is perfect for organizing resumes or any documents related to a particular topic. I do not color code my folders, but you could use each color for a category.These folders are solid construction and fit my needs perfectly. I would love to see an option that is laminated or plastic so that they hold up a little better over time.But this is a solid product for my needs."
3,"T. Graham Brown -- Joe-Cocker-esque but more soulful, fluid and nuanced","T. Graham Brown -- please search for ""Bumper to Bumper"" CD and read my review there (it's the one with ""sonics"" in the review title). This CD is good, but Bumper to Bumper and Greatest Hits would be better choices. Bumper to Bumper for 3 tunes that are not to be missed and for outstanding sonics. Sonic quality on Come as You Were CD is the same as on greatest hits -- very good as per most ""country"" production value, but nowhere near Bumper to Bumper. Greatest Hits is a better choice than this CD for having more tunes you will probably want to keep playing. Again, though, see Bumper to Bumper CD and my review there."
2,A Tab Hunter Western,"A grade ""B"" western that deserves a ""D"" grade. It showcased a Tab Hunter as a young cowboy with a cocky attitude, but Tab was 35 by the time this western was made and in some cases he looked it. However there was excellent character interplay between Hunter and George Montgomery and Yvonne DeCarlo. The crooked railroad commissioner was a blowbag and played to the hilt. For a gang of cut-throats riding in a prison wagon on their way to Huntsville Prison, at times, they seemed like a cheerful lot. John Russell's portrayal as the inept brother trying to save his doomed brother from a hanging was awful. Two stars"
4,Interesting Book,"This book has a very interesting approach using a story, like a legendto teach the points and get the foundation information across. Really learned a lot."
4,Interesting book,"New authors are usually interesting, they have originality. This one is no exception. The story starts off in Argentina - we meet Wolf, a former CIA man sent on a mission by his new employer - German firm DGL. Things start to unravel, and we end up in Peru, and a national tragedy occurs.Enter Jennifer, a young reporter who seems to get mixed up in this case in a very unlikely manner. Why we find out later. The plot moves to the US, where it seems that terrorists are getting together to assassinate the president of the US...but is that really their plot, and who exactly is the enemy?After a lot of twists and turns, we arrive at the conclusion that was to me, a bit of a turn for the bizarre. The ending is not at all what I was expecting, but it made sense.This is a good book, and I recommend it. Graphic violence and scary terrorist situations make this an adult only novel, not for kids at all.Jamie from Oakland, CA"
4,Slightly better than his first,"But this is a different subject matter all together. The title is a little deceiving, you expect this to be about War, some guy being paid money to take out enemy figures, covert operations, etc. That is not what this is - This is a story about a woman seeking retribution, her smart yet distant husband, and a man with no past. Who the actual mercenary is is not revealed till the end - to me the story actually had three ""American"" mercenaries. It was a satisfying plot, the characters were strong, and there were lots of deaths. Keep writing Mr Alexander, I think bestseller may be in your future someday.Greg from Virginia"
4,He had me going...,"The book starts off exciting, and then you are kinda scratching your head trying to figure out why certain people are acting like they are. There are clues to the ending - I will say that - throughout the book! Look for them! There are clues to who Jennifer is, there are clues to who Wolf is. There are even clues to what type of oprganization DGL is. Pay attention in this one, or you will be lost till the end. Complicated plot, but nicely woven together in the end. I would have liked to see more of what happened to Frank and kelly, that angle should have been pursued more. A suggestion to the author - make Frank and Kelly recurring characters- they are very likable."
5,Some things never grow old,"This is one of the lesser known classics on this subject.As old as this book is, the basic truths of this business are the same and there are a healthy number of those included here."
3,"""Moderate"" risk according to EWG. ""Natural"" doesn't mean safe","I registered for this based upon the manufacturer's statement that it was natural, and should have done more research on it. According to the EWG (Environmental Work Group) it carries a ""moderate"" health risk with a score of 3. Bummer. I've since found a safer baby brand, Burt's Bees.[...]"
2,Not tear-free despite what the label says,"I recently bought this body wash/shampoo for my 1 year old. The label claims that it is tear-free, but every time even a little bit of this gets in his eyes, he screams in pain until I rinse his eyes out. I should mention that this has never happened with any other shampoo we have used on him, and now that I have switched back to his old shampoo, we do not have that problem anymore. Also, this is lightly scented, but to me it smells like the shampoo we used to use on our dog -- not really a great smell for a baby. The good thing about this product is that it was on a list of shampoos/body washes that are recommended as safe (chemical-wise) for babies and children."
4,Another great addition to my library!,"I found this one a bit difficult to read compared to Hogan's other novels, but as always the story is great as is the scientific theory behind it."
2,"Promising material, but grindingly dull prose","""Paths to Otherwhere"" is an example of a book that I wanted to like. The premise of the Many Worlds theory is fascinating, but the storyline is saddled with tired government/scientist cliches and uncompelling characters.The story is clearly an excuse to explore cutting-edge concepts. No problem there... science fiction is well-populated with works of the type; Arthur C. Clarke and Michael Crichton come to mind. But Hogan's focus is so slanted towards the science that he forgot the story. He is a good author: The Giants/Ganymede series is a memorable work. Hogan unfortunately stumbles here..."
4,Bobby's Girl Back Home,"Kathy, A.K.A. Ket, is returning home to her planet. With her is her husband Bobby, his friends and his family. They are going to introduce Thradon to movies and golf. Just before they arrive, the recovering government has sent out a team to thradonform another planet.While Ket, Bobby and the other humans are welcomed with open arms, the science team on the other planet has been attacked and occupied by another alien race. Bobby and Ket turn Thradon upside down by introducing Shakespeare to the theater market while getting the movie industry started. Everything seems rosy and the changes are good. Then the fate of the thradonforming expedition is learned and its off to the rescue.A very nice and fun follow-up to BOBBY'S GIRL. The action is good without being too heavy. The drama remains serious without compromising the feel-good nature of the book. All in all a pretty fun read and a must for those who enjoyed BOBBY'S GIRL."
2,"No, thanks.","This is a sequel to Bobby's Girl that, in my opinion, could have been much better. The returning of Ket with Bobby and family is a good nail to hang a story on but the author wrote the wrong story.When Ket and the others return, Thradon is being invaded by other aliens they cannot understand or deal with (with a few expected exceptions) and only the humans can find out why. Ho hum. Not well done.I think author should have kept with the title premise and told the story that Ket, Bobby, and his parents were dreaming about at the end of Bobby's Girl; the bringing of golf and the movies to Thradon. The problems, reactions of the populace and other entertainment industries, etc., would have made for a more interesting book.This gets two stars from me for the humor, not for the story.- Dale"
1,Worthless,"Bought two tubes of Elmer's wood filler. Absolutely worthless, almost impossible to squeeze any wood filler any out of the tube. Check out the reviews for other Elmer's wood fillers packaged in tubes. Do the executives at Elmer's ever check out their products and use them? Obviously not, a complete lack of quality control in product development and oversight. Never got a chance to test the wood filler as it remains in the tubes. Should be packaged in a tin or plastic container with a lid, at least then one can use a spatula or putty knife as an applicator."
2,Outdoors,"I bought this thinking it was outdoor friendly. It did not have a reference to either outdoor or internal only on the sellers advert, and so bought in error."
4,Sennheiser SK 1093 Wireless Guitar Cable,I ordered two cables because the price was right and I wanted a spare. I received it promptly. I'm gigging with them with no issues to report. The cables are longer than the original ones but that's a plus.
4,Great quick-reference guide,"I've been reading Tarot for over a decade, and this is my favourite reference guide -- the explanations are clear and insightful, and the book is very easy to navigate as a quick-reference. It does lack some depth -- each card is given about a page and a half of explanation, and the very nature of putting each card's meaning into a formulaic breakdown, while user-friendly, does contribute to some glossing of important concepts. Still, this book is great for a beginner, or for an experienced reader who finds herself stuck and in need of a little prompting for interpretation."
4,"I like it, but...","I like this knife, but I'm slightly disappointed. I wish it were slightly sharper (not to say it's _bad_, as it does cut raw chicken breast without tearing, but it didn't shave the hair on my arm). Also, I would like it to feel more substantial: the handle seems almost cheap, and I think I see a little glue holding the blade to the handle. For $100, I'd like it to seem seamless. Nevertheless, it's a nice knife and it does slice well enough, though not as well as I'd like it to. I might look at other sushi knives if I were serious about sushi preparations."
1,substandard performance in almost every regard,"This unit has incredibly low fidelity speakers. Not much better sounding than a $30 clock radio. The electronics are pretty cheezy. The power amp only delivers a couple watts per channel. Keep the remote handy because the front panel controls are almost totally useless. All your radio station presets disappear every time you lose power (be it storm or simply unplugging the unit). It just seems like a lot of things you'd take for granted in a $60 boom box are missing in this unit. The turntable is actually one of the better features of the unit, but is is far from audio quality. I wouldn't play any valuable pristine records on it. The CD player is of acceptable quality. It is very cute looking."
4,a great addition to any room.,"it's not only fun to look at and very friendly to use, the music sounds great. needle fumbles easy though."
1,CHEAP,"This item has a nice concept, but it is poorly manufactured. My cd got stuck in it on the first use. The sound quality was very poor. It was the christmas gift that came right back to me on christmas day. I do not recommed this product for anyone. Thank god for amazon I was able to return it hassle free."
2,record player,this had good sound but broke after just a few months and was almost impossible to find someone to repair it.
4,A good book to add to your library,"The other side of silence is a well written and researched book. It seems that now-a-days books about the Deaf and the Deaf community fall into either the oralist or manualist camp, with very little falling in the center. As a sign language interpreter I am biased (of course) towards the manualist view, and generally dismiss oralist themed books out of hand. However, I was pleased and fascinated to read a thoughtful and unbiased exploration of both sides of the age old argument."
3,Is this an Audio CD or a Book?,"I'm looking for the book referenced in Henry Rollins Fanatic! on page 71. Since Henry's book is from 2004 I can only presume this is the book he is referencing, but Amazon's description is calling it both an Audio CD and a book. If Rollins recommends it, it's worth getting, presuming this item is a book. Someone should correct this entry."
3,A Little Too Cut and Dry For My Taste,"A Concise History of New Zealand is exactly that -- concise. It is an ""easy read"". The author covers all bases on the history of the human settlement of the archipelago. However, I find Philippa Mein Smith's writing style a bit too cut and dry for my tastes. Certainly, it is not riveting reading as in the case of ""The Fatal Shore"" the excellent history of the settling of Australia."
3,It has changed,"I have a small original, old container of Weil's Antilope parfum, bought in Paris, but when comparing the smell of both, the new one I received is not even similar to the old one, which I love and was what I expected. Maybe they changed their formula over time."
3,3 good songs and the rest ?,"Well, yes I had to buy this because of the hit Za Za Za. Honestly that song is fun and funny and great dance tune, the other kickbutt dance tune is El Baile De La Tortuga.I admit the ""El Grillo"" fellow who kind of raps along with Oskar ""Lobo"" has an interesting voice tone very deep sound, but he needs to practice his flow and sharpen his pitch before I'd say he's good. The cd was cheap and yes it was worth the two great dance tunes.The Bamba Cascabalera and El Chupi Chupi songs are okay. The two ""slow"" tunes are atrocious. The rest are so-so.I'd have been happier if just the first three songs and the remixes of Za Za Za were on this; then I'd give it more than a 3."
1,Bratty Brittney,the book just proved to me that she's just a spoiled monster who gets everything she wants and did not work for her fame. i'd give it zero stars but that isn't an option
5,"Great book about my favorite star on earth, Britney Spears!!","I love Britney Spears and I think this book told her story wonderfully. Of course, I am kind of impartial because I love anything about her, but if you are a big Britney fan you should enjoy this book."
5,Totally Awesome!,I would give this book 100 stars if I could. My mom sent it to me at camp and everyone at least looked through it! I'm a big fan of Britney and I loved it!
5,this book is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,I love this book. It has Wonderful pictures and a great story about Britney!! Everything I wanted to know and more. Even my mom read this book and now she likes Brit even more!!
1,it lacks depth just like her music,"as usual, a haphazard,sleazy account of her life~she's only like 16 years old hello.she's a one-hit wonder~i don't understand what all the hype is about"
5,Cute Movie!,"This movie was adorable! I loved The Ice Cream Wars and The Prince And The Ponies. Both were adorable! I know that Baby Quackers quacks in the G1 My Little Pony episodes like Thistle Whistle whistles in the G3 My Little Pony episodes! The songs I liked best was 'Babysitting' and 'Those Newborn Twins'. I will use my very favorite song, 'Babysitting' for examlpe. Here are the lyrics!Baby North Star:Babysitting! Babysitting!Babies fuss and cry and spitting!Baby Fifi:Babysitting! Babysitting!Oh, my aching head is splitting!Baby Quackers:Caring for a cuddly tot takes a lot,Your nerves get shot- quack quack quack!Baby Lickety-Split:Babies cause all kinds of trouble- Hey, you two!Baby North Star:And with twins, your trouble's double!Babysitting! Babysitting!Babies fuss and cry and spitting!All First Tooth Baby Ponies:We say ""Yes!"", they say ""No!""We say ""Stop!"", they say ""Go!""No wonder that we feel like quittingBabysitting, Babysitting....Babysitting!"
2,Flight to Cloud Castle teaches dubious values,"The Episode ""Flight to Cloud Castle"" essentially advocates arranged marriage and women 'owing' themselves to men who can provide for them. I remember seeing this particular episode as a child and realizing even then that it was a shallow attempt at pushing some very... traditional views on kids."
1,Not what my daughter expected,"My 4-year old daughter fell in love with MLP after watching the ""Princess Promenade"" DVD, so when we saw this, we scooped it up. After watching princess promenade though, watching this was torture. The animation and audio are so poorly done. Every story has a scary character that terrified my 4-year old. The cover resembles the princess promenade disk as far as imagery, but doesn't match the video at all. It seems deceptive. Only after my dissapointment did I note the 1987 production date.If I can return this, I will, because my daughter is too scared to watch it."
2,Annoying...but daughter liked it.,This has got to be one of the most annoying cartoons I have ever been subjected to....but I must admit that my 3 year old really like it.
2,Mostly what i wanted,"The picture has now changed, but when i purchased the 2"" body lift kit, the picture showed *Bumper raising brackets* when I opened the box, there was none. This was my fault for not reading exactly what was included but for $106 they could have tossed in a couple cheap metal brackets."
2,i don't like this shampoo,i have short damaged hair and i bought this shampoo for help. it has nice smell...the biggest thing that i don't like is that after 24 hours my hair looks like i haven't wash my head for 1 week. it's terrible. i will never buy this shampoo again...
4,One minor problem,"Arrived as ordered...a day easrly as usual. Only issue was that these are not a 100% custom fit for my 2010 F150...The driver's side mat needs to have a hole & grommet to fit the little plastic post the factory has on the left rear side. It was necessary to make the hole in the new mat...not a real problem, but not very ""custom"" looking."
1,Jessica Simpson - 15 Minutes...and counting!,"A real YAWNER! Just when, pray tell, will those 15 minutes of fame run out for this shallow bimbo and her equally talentless lip-syncing younger sister? Their dad sure knows how to keep stoking the publicity."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this DVD after watching Jessica Simpson's latest music video ""These boots are made for walkin'"". I thought her Reality Tour Live will have some catchy songs and video but was very disappointed. May be OK for those who just want to watch Jessica sing."
4,Amazing Artist; One of the Greatest and Most Unappreciated,"Her performance of ""I Have Loved You"" is endearing and tear-jerking. From the moment it comes with ""I Think I'm In Love With You"" you're reminded why America fell in love with JS. Although nowawdays, she's known much more for her wildly successful clothing line, you can't help but wonder why she ever stopped doing this while watching this tour. JS please give us a new album at least by next year"
3,Boring,I like Jessica Simpson but compared to other performers she is very boring. The others dance and move on stage and Jessica does not.
1,the worst ive seen jess,i love jessica simpson but this dvd is the worse ive ever seen do not buy this one all she does is twirl around and shake her but its not entertaining after the first 10 mins
3,Great DVD if you like to see how Jess interacts w/fans.,"Jessica seems to be real nice, down to earth person who loves her fans. Not many artists talk to their fans, let them ask questions, and get personal with them. Very rare you get to see this. I would have loved to be front stage at her performance!Her singing wasn't top notch like you'd hear in her CDs but you have to consider the fact that her CDs capture Jessica's best singing. If you're on tour a lot, your vocal cords do get worn out so forgive her.The wardrobes she wore were kind of goofy looking, but this is Jessica Simpson we're talking about. She's notorious for being a goofy person."
3,Not what I expected...,"I was really lucky to get a front row seat to her Radio City Music Hall sold out show... and I gotta tell you, this DVD doesn't reflect at all the experience of being there. Besides I don't think the crowd at this show was the best for the DVD filming.I'm a Jessica Simpson fan but was really dissapointed to find out that there were a couple of songs missing here including one of her best performances on the show ""I wanna love you forever""... I was just blown away when she hit those high notes.If you are a JS fan, this is a must... otherwise, you can live without it."
3,"'artsy', but good overall","Aurora, Rivers of Light is a good video overall. If you are more interested in the history of the aurora than actually seeing them on the video then is one is for you! I was hoping to see less history and more aurora shots myself. This video did not contain any information about where in Alaska to travel to see the best aurora but it did tell you what time of year they can be viewed. If I had it my way this video would contain less 'art' and more 'aurora'. The only thing that was very disappointing was the quality of the tape which had many ""warped"" sections (skewed the video and audio for a moment). I'll still give it three stars overall."
2,"Painfully dull, well produced video","It was hard to tell if the all to sparse footage of the ""Aurora"" was actually the ""Northern Lights"" or digitally produced effects. The majority of of the tape was camera panned still photos of museum prints and the history of the Aurora through past to present. If you were expecting a well produced high school science film...you won't be disappointed, but two minutes of actually watching the Aurora far surpasses this video in beauty and wonder."
4,Delivers on the title,"This video shows many minutes of Aurora Borealis -- not an easy feat since capturing COLOR video of this very low light phenomenon is extremely difficult. You'll have to overlook the somewhat cheezy computer generated graphics that occasionally punctuate the video.If you are a fan of dramatic poetry/prose reading, you'll enjoy the narration as the video is dominated by this style of voice over. The scientific explanation for the Aurora is covered briefly, but primarily this video is focused on showing the Aurora as best that can be delivered through modern low light video photography. In this, it delivers well. Enjoy this rare collection of such footage. It is quite a sight to behold."
2,Dissapointing,"Maybe it was more like buyer beware, I was really disapointed in how superficial and extrapolated the content of the subject was. I don't consider this a an essential piece for any serious u2 fan, it leaves you with way too much ambuguity."
2,Could have used an editor.,"This otherwise readable book is so fraught with typos and poor grammar that it is almost embarrassing. ""Running To Stands Still?"" ""Freedom has a scent/ Like the top of a new born babies head?"" Honestly, it is like reading a first daft by an unskilled writer."
2,"Disappointment: Interesting background, but no insight or depth of thought","I don't want to be redundant with the other reviewers, but I too was disappointed with the content of this book. Stokes seemed to harvest much of his information from old friends and old interviews - with very little analysis or insight from the band. His speculations seem banal and quite shallow with no understanding of the theological, spiritual and political power and depth of the messages found in the music. U2 deserves better and the definitive analysis of their songs has yet to be written."
1,The pot was broken and the soil was all over the box,"I received this tree two days ago and noticed the pot was smashed inside the box. The soil was all over the bottom of the box as well. If just a little more time was taken to protect the bot then this would not have happened. I took the tree out of the old pot and also noticed that the wire used to hold the tree in place was digging into the tree really bad. This worries me as it was in the trunk about 1/4"". I will be pushing for my money back AND I am not returning this junk."
1,pot was cracked when I received it!!,"when the item was received the pot was cracked in two places, rather then return it and hope the next one was OK, I patched it and plan to re-pot it!!I was not happy over the shipment being broken, but the plant is beautiful!!"
2,Wrong tree and pot and grown improperly,"The tree and pot which arrived were not the ones pictured. Also, the trunk has several indentions and rust spots from where improper wire was left on the trunk too long. I expected better."
2,"I understand advertising, but this is not quite up to par.","The tree in the picture is full, colorful, and well healthy. The tree you receive will likely be none of these things. It will be alive, and may someday be like the one in your picture. However, the one in the picture is a $40 dollar tree, the one you receive is a $15 garage sale tree."
4,Great looking bonsai but had a few wire marks!,Great tree! Really thick trunk! And very fast shipping!!! But the tree did have a few wire marks! One was really bad.. I also found a piece of wire in one of the branches I had to pull out.. But other then the wire marks it is a really good tree!! Big and healthy...
5,los apuros de dos gallos,"I did not know about the movie until I sew it, it was a funny,full of laughter, I enjoy the movie very much. and would tell my friends to buy this dvd,great story."
1,Not at all as pictured,"Unfortunately they do not use much pearl powdery stuff on these. They are uneven with some having tails, the luster is flat and on most there is nothing but an ugly yellowish sugar ball showing through. I could have done better elsewhere and next time I will."
1,NOT AS PICTURED!!!,"These pearls are not at all as pictured. There is hardly any luster to them and they are not ivory, they are too yellow. Just as others have reviewed, they are definitely not worth the money. I contacted them for a refund and they completely refused to do anything, next time I will buy elsewhere."
4,Nice Trip,"Haughton Murphy's A VERY VENETIAN MURDER reads more like a travel log than a murder mystery. The designer who is murdered really doesn't seem to be much loss and while you admire Reuben Frost's powers of deduction you can't help but cheer for the killer.Murphy seems more at home in New York.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS"
2,Merely Competent,"I picked up Road to Perdition along with ""From Hell"" by Allan Moore, and I honestly suggest that you read that instead of this. This book has no brain, really. The writing is ok, and it has a few good lines in it, but for the most part it has no flavor to it. The art, which revives the noir detective stories of the 30's, is the only reason this book deserves to be read. Other than that, it just mopes around going from page to page. The fact that O'Sullivan can just mindlessly kill people page after page (yes, about 30 pages are just textless gunfights) makes the story boring. By doing this, Collins has removed the human element of the character which is the only reason most people read graphic novels in the first place"
3,John Woo meets the Untouchables Comic Style,"When i heard this was going to be made into a movie, I wanted to see the book that would be the inspiration for such a powerful and unique Tom Hanks movie character.Upon reading the book, it was enjoyable and thrilling, it featured some amazing artwork and a suspenseful storyline.I feel the movie will be better, the movie is also written by the same author as this book.To sum up, this is an amazing book and will provide great inspiration for what will be a great novel-to-movie adaption."
4,Good read for movie fans,"This is the graphic novel on which the movie of the same name (which is awesome) is based. I didn't even know until recently that the movie was based on a book, so, it being one of my favorites, I decided to read the original story.This is one of the best graphic novels I've read, though I'm not big into them (so, small pool from which to compare). But, and maybe if I hadn't seen the movie first I wouldn't feel this way, the book makes for a more realistic plot, while the movie makes for a better story. The ending isn't as good (though I'm still looking forward to reading the sequels), and some key plot points are, in my opinion, done better in the movie. And even though there's no way I'd ever be able to draw as well as Richard Piers Rayner, I had a hard time following along sometimes because some characters were drawn too similarly, or some frames of the same character were not drawn similarly enough.Still a good, quick read, and I'd recommend it to fans of the movie."
1,"Low budget, low quality","Seems more like a joke than a movie. Or maybe ""making a movie"" was just a vain excuse for some old guy to be around a bunch of young pretty girls for a while.Don't waste your time watching this garbage."
2,Low budget throw-away!,I got this short film because I wanted to try out Amazon's video on demand on the cheap.That's just what I got. It is a story about a preacher with quite of bit of lust in his heart.Several of the women are very attractive with one blonde named Anne McDaniels who is quite spectacular.The film ends with a eighties MTV style video featuring a Tiffany look-a-like.
1,Hard To Watch,"This movie should have been titled ""Hard To Watch""(name stolen from 30 rock episode). And yet, I watched. Maybe I'll ""get it"" if I watch it again, but I absolutely will not."
4,A Great Story with some Hot Babes !,"This sexy dark comedy has what I like. A twisty story, dysfunctional characters, lust , greed, temptation and crime all in a cool setting. Great camera work. Realistic dialogue. A lot of entertainment."
2,Plot?,This was simply awful. The production certainly didn't need 44 minutes to arrive at it's un-spectacular end. Don't bother with this movie.
4,"Decent for a low-quality show, but just that.","I'm not sure who may be voting that may have been involved in the creation of this direct-to-VHS wonder- but I'd suggest that most of the votes here were.It was cute, and passed the time, but it was no darker than anything you'd see on TBS. The plot/etc was just as paper thin as well. This could have been condensed into 15 minutes and saved time. It was rather boring, and honestly, I think the credits/music video at the end were the best part of the entire show, and that's what kicked it up from 3 stars.That said, if you have some free VOD bucks, you could do a lot worse than this."
2,I have already forgotten it!,This movie was not memorable at all. I saw it two days ago and don't even remember what it was about. That's how I know it sucked!I just remember the acting was terrible.
3,"Love this stuff, but....","No one around here sells this anymore, so I have to purchase it online. I'm not sure why I thought this, but I was expecting to get 3 bottles of each item. The description says 3 pack, which lead me to believe that there were 3 of each. I was sadly mistaken. You can get a case (that's 6) of shampoo for this price. Shop around before purchasing this."
5,THE BEST!,"After watching DVDs by Howard Lederer and Mike Caro I had the sensation of wanting to puke. I swore I wouldn't get any other poker DVDs but my interest was peaked by Poker Secrets from Poker Champs. After all this was a DVD that contained secrets from Johnny Chan, T.J. Cloutier, Phil Ivey, etc. Well, I'm glad I got it! This DVD is the best I've seen for poker instruction. You learn alot of different tips from the best players in the world. It's not filled with a lot of useless theories but more practical tips one can actually use in their own game. Watching this DVD is like having all these poker greats in your living room. If your sick of all the others, give this one a try!"
1,Save your money,This video is not worth your time. It's basically interviews and they don't talk about anything that will improve your game. Save your money as this is a waste of time!
2,Not great interview collection,"This is just a bunch of interviews with some noted poker pros. However, the information they give regarding strategy is pretty thin, and the video itself is poorly produced. There are other videos out there that are much more informative and useful. This one is a pass."
1,"Not a learning tool, just for the curiosity of seeing known players","I didn't learn anything from this dvd except during the interview with Daniel Negreanu--partly because he knows how to communicate in a down to earth manner, and partly because we have to respect his enormous accomplishments (that helps you pay attention).Scotty Nguyen was fun to watch, but it was more mild entertainment than educational.It's been 2 years since I viewed this, so if you want to leave comments I'll answer any questions by having another look at the DVD.Don't bother buying this. For improvement, you should go to various online sites which offer streaming video, but not for free.Even for beginners, there's not much here.Overall, this is the 4th most disappointing poker DVD I've viewed out of perhaps 30-35 I've obtained."
3,Not many secrets,This is a good video to watch your favorite pros interviewed but there are no secrets here.
1,This video is absolutely terrible,"With a title like ""Poker Secrets From Poker Champs"", you would expect for some good tips to inhance your poker game. Not the case. The discussions are so general that they provide no usefull information whatsoever. I can honestly say the only things I learned from this video were the name of some poker players I had not heard of before, and their own stories of how they got started as poker players. You do not see a SINGLE playing card in this video. The only thing this video has going for it is the big name players, but that does not make up for the lack of information.If you are looking to improve your Texas Hold Em game, I recommend ""Poker: More Secrets of No Limit Hold 'em"" by Howard Lederer. This video is very informative, and talks about many things such as which cards you should be playing, and in which position. He goes over betting, bluffing, and many more important aspects of Texas Hold Em."
2,complete waste of time,This dvd was supremely boring and only moderately informative. Don't waste your time or money.
1,I am disappoint.,"I purchased one of these as part of a Groupon Goods deal shortly before the Super Bowl. Though it appears to serve its purpose well, the colors of the mat themselves look very dull and the trademark gold of the Saints helmet looks more gray than anything. This is in complete contrast to the sample images I've seen strewn across the net which feature comparatively bright colors -- and it makes the mat look very cheap indeed.Would not purchase again, and certainly wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
4,Another great album from them,"I remembered when Troop put out Mayday in 1998. I still can't believe that Atlantic Records dropped them from their roster in the mid-90s. But they picked themselves back up and put their album on an independent label. They still sounded good on that album. And I liked when one of the singers mentions one of their past hits, Mamacita, in a song, proving that they remember their past as well as looking to their future. I wished this album could have been promoted more, but I'm sure that they were happy with how it came out. I like that Steve Russell produced most of this album and the members wrote the songs on here. They have proven time and time again that they are a fabulous vocal group!"
1,From Troop To F-Troop ( F 4 Failure ),"Let's be clear, Troop was a very high powered group in the late eighties, early nineties. And I brought pretty much all the albums they put out. So seeing this, I expected more of the same, but better because as a group they sustained the longevity of their careers, boy was I wrong. I'm not saying that the average Troop fan will not find something on this cd they might find pleasing, I'm saying that if you expect that Troop sound from back in the day, you won't find it. I give myself the F for purchasing this Failed comeback album! Waste of studio time & money, they probably owe their label for this, groups like Boyz II Men & Jagged Edge can't take off then come back with a banging cd to keep us waiting for that next album!!! For the record, Deepa was their outstanding album to date."
3,Intimate Obsession,"Follows similar films of this nature, was a little dissoppointed with this film but I will have a better look the second time around."
4,"Good and Bright, more than 1 set doesn't sync","I bought these last year, they are pretty bright. Many people commented positively on them. The blue in the LED is always blue and does not fade. The ""light show"" is the standard eight function you will find on these types of sets.The only caveat, with two sets, they both do not start at the same function. In addition, the white and blue lights seem to be wired exactly opposite in the two sets I have. I can live with this!Overall, a bit pricey, but in the long run, they will last a long time. Plus with LED lighting, there is no fading of the color of the light, or the bulb coloring failing and flaking exposing the ""white"" light underneath. I anticipate a long life from this set of sonwflakes."
4,Beautiful,"The snowflakes are composed of a very hard and durable, clear plastic which surrounds the LED lights. When the lights are on outside they are truly beautiful. Have received many compliments from the neighbors! They are very pricey, but I am hoping that they last for quite a while. They look great strung from a front yard tree and are the highlight of our blue and white display!"
3,Led Snowflake,"Works as advertised. Snowflakes don't have mixed colors inside: three are white, three are blue. I liked my original ones better: eight snowflakes with mixed colors inside."
1,Ghastly,"Nothing is more painful than fluff or camp that can't even rise to the level of guilty pleasure. Tyler's novel suggest a pilot for a gay Aaron Spelling TV show written by a smug high school sophmore who thinks he's sophisticated because he knows how to curse. The ""bitchy"" humor (oh so knowing, if you've spent your life under a rock) makes you wince, and the characters are totally cardboard. If you want to give a fun camp novel for Xmas, skip this stinker and give one of the Patrick Dennis reissues, Little Me or The Joyous Season"
3,Easy Read,"Not a great book, but an Ok one. Something you can read in a day. Reads like a gossip column or womans magazine. Not so profound, though there are two or three pieces in the book that provoke some thought, however the object of the book does not seem to be to do so. As the reviews say.... it is an airplane or beach read that will not take so long. You definitely need to be in the mood to read this though."
5,A Whole Lot of Fun,"Ben Tyler is coming along very well. When His first book ""Tricks of the Trade"" came out, I bought it right away, and read it within 3 days-- lots of fun with humor, lots of sex, and just the best beach read. NOW he come out with ""Hunk House."" With the reality TV shows becoming a mainstream genre, Tyler put it in with six gay men. And what a ride it is! Just like his previous book, fun, humorous, and more sex than the last book. Tyler to me is a FUN read. I am now an advant fan of his writings, and look forward to more books from him. We all need some fun gay novels, and Ben Tyler is the one! Definitely get this one, and his previous book too. Fun, sex, humor-- what more would you want in a summer book? :-)"
2,Great Mind Candy,"Not Shakespear, but if your looking for a fun raunchy book to take your mind off the stresses of daily life, this is the one."
3,Fun Plot,"Another gay themed book, if your looking for one I enjoyed it. It was a fast read, the story was engaging. all in all its a decent book."
3,Relevant,"A woman from ""the West"" describes what it is like to enter, in the 1960s, the Muslim world. She marries a Muslim and describes what it's like to try and adapt his ways in his country. Though I got the feeling that she was trying a little too hard to put a positive spin on things, it's informative and interesting."
4,Excellent - but not the best translation,"The other reviews pretty much sum up the qualities of Berlioz's writing. Like others, I find is prose more inviting than his music. Immensely candid, entertaining and wonderfully written, it would be a great shame if only musicians were to read it - it's enjoyable on so many levels. The only reason I decided to write this was to urge anyone thinking of buying it to get hold of David Cairns' more modern translation. It reads far more fluently and somehow seems to get inside Berlioz's character in a way that the older translation doesn't. It also has among the appendices a valuable dissection of the contentious points and parts where Berlioz was economical with the truth."
2,Replace the 2N3055,"I've got 3 of these supplies, with the digital meter option, and two of the three have blown their 2N3055 output regulator transistors when operated at a modest 10V at 1A for several weeks of continuous use. It's easy to fix but an irritation, otherwise this unit works well as a power supply for a constant temperature bath."
1,boring and lame...,"I had a lot of trouble get a hold of my copy of this book, and I can honestly say it wasn't worth it. The characters are weak, the plot is weak and the ending was well weak!The characters are always doing one of three things, either 'pissed out of their minds' (drunk), getting drunk, or throwing up over a toilet. Everybody sleeps with everyone else's love interest! Not for the sake of moving the story along but to fill time, in order to make this read last just a hair over 2 hours. Yes just a hair over 2 hours IF you don't toss it out the window in complete disgust.The ending well I won't get into to much; Lets just say the ending wasn't so much a surprise as it was a 'Huh? How did that happen?' kind of feeling. Especially considering that the main character ending up with a guy she had maybe a total of 3 very short 'do you have the time, and how's the weather been', sort of conversations.My advice don't waste your money on this book."
4,Amanda's Wedding by Jenny Colgan,What a great first book. It's funny & smart. You can hear each character's voice. Jenny Colgan kept me laughing and made me want to visit the British Isles. ---M. Vandercapellen
4,Another Bridgetish book!,"This book was just too funny, it was heartwarming and had tons of twists and turns. A great read!"
2,Fails in comparison,"In a vacuum, perhaps AMANDA'S WEDDING would be more interesting to read. Yet coming--at least in the U.S.--after a half-dozen similar novels, it seems boring and derivative. Oh, and predictable, too.BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY certainly is the best known of this genre of books. A couple of books by Isabell Wolff, such as MAKING MINTY MALONE and THE TRIALS OF TIFFANY TROTT, probably are better than BRIDGET JONES' DIARY. So AMANDA has stiff competition and, in comparison, she fails miserably.Having read all of these books and a couple of others, it is impossible not to wonder whether the women of Britain aren't far more self-absorbed, self-indulgent and shallow than their American counterparts. AMANDA'S WEDDING offers no new insights."
2,Cotton candy for the brain,"I thought the storyline was very compelling, though not as humorous as some of the other books of this type I've recently read. And I can't say I really identified with any of the characters - they were very over the top - a bit over done, really. The little bit about the psychic at the end seemed overly contrived, and cheesy, but the ending was comfortably predictable. It's a nice, fluffy-quick read, but I would put it fairly far down the list of recommended books."
4,Very much Bridget,"This novel reads very much like Bridget Jones (including the setting in England, the friends, the language). If you like Bridget, you'll like this one too.Very funny, easy to read, entertaining, the story surrounding the wedding of Amanda and the reactions from her friends and family. Whisk yourself away into the life of twenty-something in London and all the conflicts."
4,Melanie's World,"This was a fun, quick read....I loved each adventure that was hiding in the works for Melanie. She handled each situation with such flare.This story was about friendship, deceit, drunken nights and the like. I was a little disappointed with the ending. I was hoping for something different.....Melanie had trusted her boyfriend a bit too much. Alex was not to be trusted at all, but was given a lot of space by Mel. Unfortunately she gave him too much space and he taught her a difficult lesson.I was not pleased with how the author allowed Melanie to keep taking the stuff Alex was dishing out. However, it seems that a lot of authors do this.....??All-in-all, it was a fun summertime read. Glad I went on the journey with Melanie and gang....."
1,Boooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnng,"And I was looking for something like ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" I want more Bridget Jones! I didn't know where to find her. She certainly wasn't in this book. I can't believe there were any good reviews for this book. Awful, awful. I couldn't even finish it. Do not waste your time!"
3,Amanda's Wedding,"Another light, easy reading book in the Bridget Jones genre... Definitely not one of the better ones. I thought the book had promise, but never seemed to live up to it- the ending was completely cliche and it seems like the author was looking for an easy way out. This book was okay."
3,"Witty, but that's all","I suppose I'm biased, because I'm a hard-core believer in romance and all that, but this book didn't quite hit the spot. First of all, I couldn't really understand why so many people fell in love with the main character, since she really wasn't all that nice. I felt that everybody ended up with the wrong person. I thought at the beginning of the book, that I knew exactly how it would all end. The ending surprised me certainly, but it didn't satisfy me. Nonetheless, this book was quite well-written and fast-paced."
4,Great until the end!,"This book was an absolute riot-- I read it over the course of one day, ditching my friends at lunch to read it instead. I was laughing (out loud) all the way through-- until I got to the end!! The ending was so unexpected, so un-led-up to, so completely *wrong*, that I walked around for the rest of the evening with my brow unconciously furrowed. Take my advice and skip the last chapter-and-a-half!!"
5,Uproarious Look at British 20-Somethings,"I bought this book at a Heathrow newsstand prior to boarding the long flight back to SFO -- and had tears of laughter rolling down my face before take-off.The characters are rich and distinct, the dialog is incredible, and the narrative portions will have you rolling in the aisle of your plane, too.If you liked Bill Bryson's books, you'll love Amanda's Wedding."
4,Whimsical fun,"With the recent spate of novels of British 20-somethings (Bridget Jones, Confessions of a Shopaholic, Love:A User's Guide, Ralph's Party), I just had to check this one out. It's a fun novel, full of the usual girltalk over a curry and lots of shopping in trendy shops. This book, about the wedding of an annoying ex-classmate to a rich bachelor, has many funny moments, and the characters are charming. I especially enjoyed Mel's encounters with the over-large suitor. If you are looking for a fun, frothy read, then this one is for you."
4,A fun read,"I made the mistake of bringing this book on a business trip. Instead of doing my work on the plane, I read this book instead. It was fun and entertaining and had a terrific surprise ending. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoyed Good in Bed, Bridget Jones' Diary, or other comic novels."
2,Fell apart at the end,"Based on others' comments, I thought this would be a fun beach book -- and it was, until the end. The ending was completely incongruous -- without giving anything away, characters that have been building throughout the entire book suddenly change without reason, and you have no idea why she ends up with the guy she ends up with. It was as if someone else wrote the last few chapters, and messed it all up. Other little things, like sloppy editorial errors (main character Fran called ""Frank"", for instance), took away from it for me, but it was the ending that made me rate it so low."
2,Pretty Shallow,"I really thought this would be a lot better than it was. Once again, as with 99% of Bridget Jones clones, this book pales in comparison. The ending is sloppily tied together and completely unrealistic, and the characters completely flat. Does anyone really care about Melanie's roommate, or - for that matter - Amanda? If Melanie and Fran are too ""lower class"" for her, why would Amanda even bother and, not to spoil the ""surprise"" ending, but Amanda's sudden behavior toward Melanie at the wedding comes off as completely ridiculous. Overall - don't waste the money."
2,A Bridget Jones Wannabe,"I found this book to be poorly written and not at all clever. I expected to be an insider to the main character and read, as in Bridget Jone's Diary, about her inner most thoughts and emotions but instead got a very shallow portrayal of someone that I could not relate to. The plot is thin and uninteresting as are the characters. There are also holes in the motivation of the characters - if Melanie & Fran hate Amanda so much why do they bother to see her when she calls - why do they even care, let alone conspire to ruin her wedding. I am not at all impressed."
4,"Quick, fun read","I'm so tired of the brit romance novels, but this one actually held my interest and had me laughing aloud. It's not Dickens, but if you are looking for something fun and quick to read (or if you are tired of all the weddings as I was), it will give you another perspective. It will definitely have you looking at your next wedding a little differently!"
5,How Can You Not Love Lucy?,"This completes my ""The Lucy Show"" collection - five years of Lucy in color (the first season in B&W)! If you're a Lucy fan (and who isn't?) there's not much to say... You have to see the episode with Joan Crawford to believe it - this amazing legend seems so different in ordinary circumstances compared to the overblown dramas that shaped her career."
4,If you love Lucy,This show is solid....but sometimes painful. You are getting LUCY in her finest here - but the shows in this season were more about the guest stars. It is a fun ride seeing all the people she teamed up with!
5,The Queen of Comedy,I was looking forward to receiving this series. I enjoy every minute of it. I am a fan of Lucille Ball. She is amazing ...very funny.
5,A totally fun-filled adventure,"The Great Cannon Beach Mouse Caper is an exciting children's storybook about an adventurous pair of young church mice which is written by Peter Waugh for intermediate-reading-level children. A charmingly written narrative enhanced with black-and-white illustrations by Don Sunderland, The Great Cannon Beach Mouse Caper an especially recommended for both school and community library collections as being a totally fun-filled adventure that can motivate young people to improve their reading comprehension to higher levels."
4,"Perry Mason: The Seventh Season, Vol. 2","It wasn't as good as the previous seasons, but I enjoyed it! If you love Perry Mason, you will like it!"
2,Disappointed,"As an avid Perry Mason fan, I have collected seasons one through seven. I am not purchasing seasons eight and nine. The stories in season seven, especially the second volume, are often too complicated, too histrionic, and too grim. No one in the cast except the Paul Drake character is having any fun. Some stories do not have the Della Street character which really hurts the overall feel of the shows. Raymond Burr is clearly not enjoying it and has lost the ""spring in his step"" and his voice. I understand we all get older! And I understand the ""times they were a changin'"" by season seven. Still, I'm going to continue enjoying seasons one through six which still had a sense of humor and stories that made sense."
5,Did Not Disappoint Me,There is nothing like the old Perry Mason series. I do not even watch the garbage they have on TV today. I asked my son to give me Season 8 for Christmas!
5,Perry Mason fans... unite!,For the true Perry Mason fans.. this is merely the second to the last season of wonderful Perry Mason episodes. And I have to admit that I love watching them without commercials.
5,Great Unit,"As a pro musician, I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board, I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner, Digital Delay (2 of them), Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really, really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the ""On"" position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars, especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
3,More of a listing than an actual book on the subject...,"...but it does list a great deal of silent horrors both rare and well-known. A perfect book for those needing titles and plot descriptions to scour local video haunts, though not so much for those looking for any interesting stories or trivia on films of the time.Worth picking up if you're hardcore on silent screamers."
5,VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE!!!!! THANKS!!,I was very pleased with my cd. It was almost like brand new!! The c.d is in excellent condition. I have delt with other sites and you all are so far the ones I have had no problems with!! Thank you for making my shopping enjoyable and not riske' if you know what i mean!!!!!!!!!!!
1,What have they done to the Queen?,"And what has the Queen done to herself? Why must they try to make Aretha au courant or hip, and weigh her down with these sub-standard songs, sub-standard productions by marginally talented but hot-for-the-fleeting moment songwriters and producers.Please! Someone Save the Queen!"
1,Shrill screaming from a once-great artist,"I bought this cause I was told that Aretha had finally returned. I was sadly misinformed. She tries some vocal gymnastics but it's just very unpleasant on the ears. Save your money and buy some of her older Atlantic albums before her voice went south and when she recorded good songs.Disappointing, and I wish I had saved my money and bought a Jennifer Holliday CD."
4,"Hey, guys, this is REE we're talking about....","Aretha Franklin can do more with one note than most singers can do with a complete aria. So what if it's not up to her best, anything that she does is worthy of at least four stars...and this one doesn't disappoint."
1,And a Mediocre Album Is Still a Mediocre Album,"Other than the kind-of, sort-of ""hit"" title single produced by Lauryn Hill -- which is about the only reason it got the little airplay it did receive -- this is another perfunctory performance by the former Queen of Soul. Granted, she does sound a little better than she has lately -- not as much gravel and hoarseness -- maybe she really did finally give up them cigarettes -- but she's still a far cry far those wonderful mid-sixties and early seventies performances that earned her the title Queen of Soul. Now she's just an faded memory of what she once was and with no fire or excitement.Where's Ted White when you need him?"
5,If you can find this buy it.,"These videos are amazing. The live performances are great, I bought these videos back when I was in high school. I must say they aged very well. If you love Nine Inch Nails you will love these videos."
1,Bad Taste,"This is pretty interesting how Trent Reznor does his stuff, and the inspiration for all of it.After all he did some stuff in his house, which used to be owned by Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate. As we all know Ms Tate and four others were murdered (no, butchered) here by Charlie Manson's followers way back on the night of August 8th 1969. The house aint there anymore though. Hmmmm where did Trent get the inspiration for March Of The Pigs? Probably from the word pig written in Sharon's Blood on the front door.Cool you think? Tell that to the relatives.This is tasteless garbage."
4,"Great video, for the hardcore fans","There is a bit of flaws on this: the Self-Destruct tour is a dissapointment for those who remember it. Some little detail was shown on this (Trent smashing an exit sign, Broken songs should've mainly been live, because Broken is a lively set.)There's also ups: The video of The Perfect Drug, I get to see more on my idol.Now the live one: 3.5/5-- I hope when the Fragility 2.0 tour VHS/DVD/CD comes out it's more of what I expect. This video is okay but could've been better. But i don't dislike it.The music videos: 4.5/5-- Sin was a bit scary. Gay men smearing blood on each other. THe Perfect Drug is my Favorite NIN video on this, but I want to see Into The Void in the future.(afer all, it is my fave NIN video). Down In It is a bit like a story on this video. Exception is Burn from the NBK soundtrack.However, if you're not already a hardcore NIN fan, don't buy this. The NIN songs are good, but SD tour's a bit dissapointing. Otherwise, believe the hype"
5,Closure,"Closure was a great movie. It's suspense, videos and everything else is BEYOND belief. I really loved this video from beginning to end (except for getting up to change the videos)"
5,A Grotesque Masterpiece,"I recieved Closure today, but before then my older brother had said something about very disgusting backstage stuff. I found nothing of the sort. I suppose somethings could be classified as ""ew"" but the way it was edited made it so you really didn't see the details.I haven't had the time to watch the second tape, but i plan to tonight. I have seen the uncut Closer and Happiness in Slavery (those being the ones i was warned not to see, i just had to download them.)From what i have seen in those two videos have been grossed out but at the same time amazed. Though I had to cross my legs during Happiness in Slavery, i found the direction was marvelous. and the message. Closer is wonderful. even the edited version with the ""scene missing"" card is awesome.I suggest buying Halo Twelve. It's a grotesque masterpiece, the perfect collection to ward off your Good Charlotte friends."
5,A Masterpiece,"Trent really outdid his self this time. Anyone who has listened to music in their life would enjoy this one. As a lifelong NIN fan, i strongly suggest if you dont have this treasure, get it now!"
3,Closure and all that could have been.,"First of all I am a diehard nine inch nails fan. I was very excited to get this video, and it is good, but it has a lot of weak points that may sway some peoples interest. First off, the music video tape is completely fine, no problems with it whatsoever and am happy that it contains all nine inch nails music videos, uncensored, up to the release of the VHS. however on the documentary/concert tape at some points the audio gets to me. It sounds like you are listening through blown speakers. It is on and off however. The video is not too bad, I like the documentary footage, but some of the concert performances have sub-par video. All and all it is a decent buy, but I would check out And All That Could Have Been for a more accurate portrayel of what a Nine Inch Nails concert is."
4,Excellent video set,I've had this since the day it was released and it just doesn't get old. One video includes all the bands videos up through Perfect Drug (including the controversial Happiness in Slavery video!). The 2nd video is filled with live material and backstage footage. If you're a big NIN fan like me you should love these vids. I only gave this 4/5 stars because the quality of the live material isn't as good as it could have been (but its still good and not bad by any means). This video set was a great addition to my collection.
5,"Not a review, a message","I see that the reviewer below hasn't heard the news. Trent has planned on releasing this on DVD. There was some protesting from his ex-manager about it, but now that the battle in court is over, Trent can re-release this. The DVD should be out before too long, so anyone planning on buying this version should wait. It's rumored that the DVD version will include the Broken movie and the videos he's released since the VHS of Closure. Until then, you can watch most of the songs on NIN.com, albeit with crappy quality."
3,A must have for every nin fan!,"Conditions are good, a little booklet and an external cover are missing, but it is used...the price was very good!"
2,horrible transfer!!! UTTER CRAP! VHS is actually better-shame,I always enjoyed this video-until I bought this DVD. WHAT A HORRIBLE BLACK MARKET BASEMENT TRANSFER! I will never buy from this seller again. BLACK MARKET CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,See it with someone you love!,"Fantastic collection of nin videos as well as some good live concert footage. Also includes some backstage and interview scenes. If you're a ninnie, you MUST own this. In fact, you probably already do."
5,"Brilliant, Exravigant and Revealing!","Come on, you know you wanna see this sh*t. Otherwise why the f*ck would you be here? Trent Reznor diplays his professinal ability to the very extent. Not to mension his band, Jim Rose and his show, Marilyn Manson and live performances, as well as every video he made showable to the planet. So sit back, do whatever it is you do and watch this sh*t. If you're a Nine INch nails fan get it here on the internet at amazon.com (video) or go steal it at your local mall, or whoever the f*ck carries it. SEE IT!! Thats all I'm getting at. So go."
5,The Perfect Drug,"I had to give this 5 stars, I mean it is NIN and all of their awesome videos are on one of the tapes! This 2 tape set (depending on which tape you view first) starts with videos for Head Like a Hole (classic NIN) Wish, Happiness in Slavery (certainly NOT for the squeamish) March of the Pigs, Gave Up (featuring Marilyn Manson and filmed at the Sharon Tate house) to the 2 most brilliant works of art in music video: Closer and The Perfect Drug. The second tape includes concert footage and backstage happenings with Marilyn Manson, David Bowie and the Jim Rose Circus. I only wished that it had more of the backstage stuff and that the filming wasn't so distorted in parts, but Trent will do as he will and we will love it!"
5,A great NIN showcase,"This video is very well done, giving you the choice of watching all of NIN's current (at the time) UNCENSORED videos or their concert footage. The concert footage shows much more backstage footage than alot of other live show videos I've seen. It is all genuine, with no cuts to ""speak to the camera""on their personal philosophies. The footage is raw and showcases all of the antics of the NIN live band. Any NIN fan needs to own this video, and if you've never experienced NIN, it's a great introduction."
5,Essential for all NIN fans!,"This video rules! Ok vid1: Live footage (which rules) and a lot of backstage stuff, inc. Jim Rose and Marilyn Manson! See the band smash stuff! And then... smash more stuff... well anyway vid1 rules :)vid2: an almost complete set of NIN videos. It has all videos that I have seen (Up to the perfect drug)except for the broken set (which is kinda understandable, those who have seen it would understand :), and burn which is available on the Natural Born Killers directors cut. It also didn't include the Head Like A Hole or Down In It remix videos :( But these aside vid2 rules as well :)I have watched these videos so much it isn't funny. They are not just 1 watch and that's it kind of videos, which is good.5 stars! Although it still would have been cool if the Broken movie had been included..."
3,What A Truly Cool World,"I love this book and story. The book was more worn than I expected, so I was somewhat disappointed with the quality, but I am happy I made the purchase."
1,Not very funny and not very positive for our children.,"I was excited to pick up this book because the illustration is gorgeous and I usually like most of Julius Lester's books. Although I am not a parent, I have many godchildren, as well as nieces and nephews. I thought about buying this book for one of them, and thank goodness I read it in the store before I purchased. I did not like the story nor the dialogue (a little too colloquial for my taste). I would encourage reading before buying, or you may be disappointed."
4,The power of Story,"I was fortunate to attend a talk by Julius Lester just last night. His talk, titled ""Story: A Way of Self-Knowledge,"" describes the power of story in helping us define ourselves, our beliefs, our loves, our fears, our pain, and our joy. Story is done and experienced by all people everywhere and has been since the dawn of mankind. Every religion has its own creation story that seeks to define how we relate the divine. In this adaptation of an African creation story, Lester uses modern sights, sounds, and realities to bring families together in the search for how to make sense of God and make God's love tangible. He read the book in its entirety and the entire room laughed and nodded throughout, finally giving him a standing ovation when he finished. It may not be for everyone, but the point is that all of us have our own stories that give meaning to our lives. You must find or create the one that works for you."
3,Core Blast with Tracey,"Tracey will lead you and her team of 2 through a 50 minute workout using a variety of equipment: med ball or dumbbell, Swiss ball, Bosu, and step. Exercises are familiar ones with short reps: sit-ups, push-ups, planks. That being said, I'd recommend it for beginner-intermediate. It's not intensive at all, so if you want a light core focused workout day, this is an option."
3,They left one thing out!,"This is a nicely illustrated and written story about Ireland's Columcille, but the author left one very important point out--Columcille was a monk! That's right, a Christian leader in ancient Ireland. To read this book, one would only know he was a scholar & lover of books, but his claim to fame was as a religious man."
4,A PERFECT Back to School Book!,This book was read as part of the Catholic Mosaic program with our kids. It happened to be read around the first week of school and the subject of being a scholar and how important books are to EVERYONE was highly appropriate. Definitely a keeper!
2,Beginner Video,"If your a rookie this video might be for you. Otherwise if you've slid a rail or curb then this probably isn't. Arlo is on the cover, but I didn't see him anywhere in the video. Also now that I think of it they didn't have a half pipe either. See allextremesports.com for extreme sports action. This is more a fitness video than aggressive or extreme."
5,like a breath of fresh air ...,"a bare-bones, easy to digest commentary on one of the Buddha's cardinal discourses on meditation instruction. Bhante Vimalaramsi stresses the addition of a step of relaxing (tranquilizing) the mind/body that many other teachers seem to gloss over. recommended for those new to anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)or those struggling with their meditation that and want a new perspective on this timeless practice."
5,excellent blanket,"My son who is 3 1/2 received the blue blanket like this with the puppies on it as a shower gift before he was born. It, since his birth has been his favorite blanket in the world. He loves it so much, that we got 3 spares in case we lost one. We are expecting a little girl this july and the first thing he asked when we told him was ""Mommy, can we get a special blankie like mine for my baby sister?"" We made it his special project to select just the right blanket for her, and this is the one he selected (In purple) we hope she loves it just as much as he has."
2,You get what you pay for,Pay for real vice grips is my advice. The locking mechanisms on these is very cheap.
2,welding clamps,"While not a name brand I figured these pliers would still get the job done but that is not the case. There feel cheap, not very smooth in operation. The large c type clamp would benefit from swivel feet at the contact area. They are hard to use with one hand. I regret the purchase and should have went with a name brand."
2,"Never mind, there junk!",I originally had wrote a good review for this set but now im editing this review to tell u these clamps are not that great as I first thought. Better deal would just be a set of decent locking or regular c clamps.
3,It's just a welding clamp.,"The fact that your only using these to hold your panels to spot weld or plug weld makes these OK for that purpose but should you need to adjust them for thickness changes you will know right away they are without question NOT VISE GRIPS even if they look similair.. They are poorly manufactured, the adjustment bolts hang up making adjustments sometimes tricky the quality of workmanship just IS NOT there but they are however useable .. So OK is all I can give this tool..."
2,poor quality but very cheap.,These are the worst quality clamps I have ever seen.The clamping ends are not even straight. They were very cheap and I guess so was I.They will clamp but not what I was expecting.Buyer beware.
4,locking clamps,These clamps can be used for a variety of purposes. I used them to assist with completing the assembly of a storage shed. I was able to use the clamps to hold together sections that shoud have required a second person to hold. The clamps filled in nicely.
1,Poor Quality,I didn't expect high quality for the price but this was not even worth the time. Clamp broke at weld on first light clamp with minimal pressure. Very poor quality.
3,intersting angles,These tools have been very handy to hold weird pieces and angles as I weld. I need another set though as it seems for heavy stuff or long stock two is better. Grease em up though or keep em dry. Good price for what you get.
4,widely relevant,"i am not a christian, nor do i relate to the christian lifestyle yet i had no difficulty in recognizing the relevance and meaning in wallis's writing. the spirituality and morals he speaks of to salvage our collapsing society should be found in all humans, regardless of religious affiliation. he does a good job of including all walks of people. his focus on strictly black and white racism, however, seemed narrow-minded to me because it neglected the various other races and conflicts. he did get his point across, though."
2,Not Thrilled,"This video was shot very poorly for a bellydance superstars dvd, looks like fan footage. i had seen alot of these dance routines before, this is a good dvd if you do not own any other bellydance superstar tribal dvds, if you own most of them its not worth paying for a few new routines. sharon kihara and zoe are great in this though! kami also has a nice routine as well"
5,Great Dance DVD,If you like the best in belly dancing check this DVD out. Very professionaly done. Also great bb dance music.
2,Meh,"I am a Henry Green completist. I am wild about his novels. So I expected to like this, and I'm enough of an egghead not to bore easily. I also love history and biography and autobiography. But it's not at all compelling. He wrote it because he assumed he'd die in the war. He didn't die in the war. The most interesting part of his life and his most mature observations were yet to come. He hadn't really lived yet. This book is full of typically adolescent introspection: all molehills, no mountains."
2,Soul-less,"First off, let me say that the Trojan box sets are the greatest thing since gin met tonic. That said, I was very disappointed with this particular offering. The songs don't translate well (mostly), the singing was bad (sometimes mediocre), and, after reading the track list a few times, I realized that most of the original versions weren't that great to begin with. ""Rock The Boat""? ""Kung Fu Fighting""? ""T.S.O.P""? W.T.F.?Q: So why buy this set anyway? A: Because you need to get your hands on ALL reggae, good and bad. You'll have to look long and hard for these songs individually, so why not shell out the $25 or so and get 'em all neatly packaged w/ liner notes. If you're on a budget (like most of us), get something else, like the Instrumentals set or one of the Ska volumes."
2,close but no cigar,"After having the market flooded with nearly four thousand box sets, how is one to choose?I went with this one thinking it was going to be nice and funky interpretations of American soul songs, but instead am left with three cds of bland covers. It's like listening to a Jamaican wedding band. The tracks are just straight covers with a little skanky upbeat thrown in for the ""foreign spice"".The only cd worth listening to is the second one, devoted to 'funk'. This is actually pretty enjoyable. Disc one (motown) and disc three (love songs) are so boring I couldn't keep my finger off the fast forward button on my remote control.If you're into funky interpretations of American soul or soulful reggae, stick to the SoulJazz label's 100% comps or the Studio One Soul collections. Much more worth your money, even if you are only getting one cd for the one cd price."
1,Never received,I haven't received this book yet and I ordered it a really long time ago. I verified the correct address; I am just waiting.
4,Makes me wanna bounce,"Everytime I hear ""Too Close"" on the radio I just wanna start bouncin' wherever I am. This is a great smooth song that makes me smile when I hear it!"
1,Let's forget about their looks and look at the music,"This album is the most mediocre and half-assed piece of R&B I've ever bought. I'm a fanatic of all forms of African-American music, R&B is my favorite. Unfortunately, besides ""butta love"" with its clever lyrics and ""too close"" with its dance beat, this album is a goes down hill. The album as a whole has flat and unstimulating beats, hooks and lyrics. The focus is on sex. There's nothing wrong with having an album about sex, many artists write entire albums on sex, but creativity, ingenuity and diversity is breaks the monotony. Next would be wise to ride out the two singles for all they can get, and spare the public any of the other disappointing tracks."
5,Butta Love,I Love it!! Butta Love is so cool and buttery!! Almost all of their are awesome and too close is just thr right song to get you in the mood!!
3,Lacks Substance,"Next is a very talented group...lyrically. They harmonize wonderfully. Unfortunately, that just isn't enough to set them apart. Like many other groups, Next is caught between hiphop and R&B. Produced by Treach (Naughty By Nature), Next just can't seem to escape the roughneck style for the real substance you feel lies in their songs. Some good beats, tight vocals, and a couple songs save the album from being completely disappointing."
5,THIS ALBUM IS OFF THE HOOK!!! NO QUETIONS ASKED!!,"I heard the album at my mother's house and instantly won over. These brothers have a style unsurpassed. I like the music, the lyrics, and the vocals. I'm strongly looking forward to the second album,(I know there will be one). I mean I heard the album at Mom's house so if it was good enough for her, then I definitely had to have it. Peace to Next and much luck on all future endeavors"
2,Nice but clean it up for those that don't like smut,"I like Butta Love i'ts a very nice song then the rest of the album is just one big freak fest! Don't get me wrong the brotha's are fine and really know how to sing, but why so much sex? I know this is the generation where sex sells , but get a grip. There is more to life. The music and the beats are off the hook but there is too much perversion. I hope when Next come out with there next album (and I know there will be one because the guys are talented) I hope they clean it up. I think they are putting out the wrong message of sexual immorality to the youth, who are the majority listening to there music. I'm only 17 so that means alot coming from me. I like next but they need to get some respect if not for themselves than for the people who raised them, and if not for them , for all the young people out there."
3,The album was ok. Not what I expected!!!!!,"I was extremely excited when I got the Next album. I think they is so HOT!! (Especially R.L.)but as tragic as it may sound, I was very disappointed. Only 3 songs were worth hearing. What happened???"
2,Very run of the mill,Butta Love was alright but Too Close is the only worthy song on this disc.aside from that this is a Lame Album especially the vocals.typical 90's Lame R-N-Boring.
5,Next has a bomb album.,"I really dig the album.Besides having cool lyrics ,they also have good-looking brothers,especially Tweety.I've heard other songs they have done with other singers, and it is all good."
2,Needs work,"Sadly, the only songs on here that are really good are the songs they made videos for (Butta Love, Too Close, and I Still Love You). Everything else is pretty dull. That song with Adina Howard was terrible!!! They're trying too hard to be sexy."
1,Rated Tacky,Butta Love was okay.but the real and only Gem here is Too Close.the rest is pure current day Lame R-N-B.Boring and Bland.these cats are singing all out of tune.
5,NEXT IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I THINK THAT NEXT IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST GROUPS OUT THERE THEY CAN SING AND THEY LOOK GOOD. R.L. IS SO FINE AND I HOPE I GET TO MEET HIM ONE DAY. THE CD IS VERY ROMANTIC AND IT SHOWS THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO TREAT A WOMAN.
1,S-E-X,They actually made a song about making love on the dance floor with their clothes on. Nuff said
2,So-so,"It is good if you want to learn a wide range of things. It has lots of phrases, and the phrase book is small enough to carry around, and you can use the index to flip right to pages with sentences using the word you looked up. For actual learning i dont think it is that great though. The tapes only say each phrase twice, and not slowly enough. Also, this set is just words and phrases- there are no activites or anything to give you practice using the language. If you just want to pick up some words for a trip, sure get this product, but for really learning some of the language i would suggest investing a little more $ in a more educational product."
4,Good roadmap,This book gives you an insight into the complexities of building your own house. Organization seems to be key.
1,Not what I was looking for,"I was looking for a book that had information one needed to know about subcontracting. I bought this book, because the computer search stated that this was the best book for this information, likewise, this book spoke more to it's topic ""How to design and build your own house"". It is obvious that what this book is speaking to, and what I was looking for are two totally different things, but it's very good for someone who is looking forward to literally building their own home, and not subcontracting."
2,out of date,Many of the concepts are timeless but the edition I received was 15 years old and much of the technology and materials in house building have changed.
4,"Careful, it is an engineering book","I bought this thinking I'd give it to my mother as a Christmas gift... not a good idea. When you open it up and read through it, it is an engineering book with the formulas for structure."
2,I really wanted to like this *2 1/2*,"This cd starts out promisingly with the absurdist Pope John Paul but quickly goes downhill afterwards. Although songs like In The Valley and Rod Stewart are catchy, the rest of the songs either sound like blatant Unicorns rip-offs or annoying Weezer-esque whining. Also the vocal histrionics begin to grate by the time one gets halfway through the album."
5,stop reading reviews and just buy it.,"Honestly, if you are sitting here contemplating buying this cd, just do it. If you like the Unicorns, Olivia Tremor Control or basically anything E6, Broken Social Scene, Tapes n' Tapes, the Magnetic Fields, even Modest Mouse, then you should listen to this. Even if you don't like any of the above bands, I would still force you to listen to this. So good, one of the most mind-blowing things I've bought since Boys and Girls in America. Yeah, I know, HUGE, but I'm pretty pumped about this cd. You will be too."
5,utterly delightful,"I haven't felt this way about a band in years. Not the most consistent album, certainly, but I can tell already that it will be my album of the year. Funny and absurd yet somehow moving and heartbreaking. This album has made my summer marvelous. I adore them, truly."
4,One of the more under-rated bands,"Cumbersome is one of the bands better songs and definately one of the better known, but there are a number ofother great songs by the band."
5,Excellent,"The first in the series is so good , I ordered the other two installments and was not unhappy with those either. First class all they way. I like it so much much I have watched all 3 in the series again and again. The murder, mayhem, blackmail,and sex all seems so civilized somehow."
1,"Just rental only, no thanks, I will pass.","I would totally buy this, but renting it would rob me of the ability to savor it. No thanks. The material is phenomenal, a real British Machiavellian pleasure, a pity the price of admission is so exclusive."
5,"FU, The Greatest Villain in Television History","Because an exceedingly verbose (not to mention obtuse) review of this show has already been written, I'll cut to the chase: Francis Urquhart (referred to as ""FU"" by friend and foe alike in the show), brilliantly portrayed by Ian Richardson, is the best (or worst, depending on how you look at it) bad guy to ever grace the small screen. Never in your life will you loathe a character so much as FU. Never will you cringe as much as you will when FU turns to the camera and explains to you exactly what his dastardly plans are and exactly how he intends to carry them out. Never will you be more horrified as when you see FU's every plot and subplot come to fruition, despite being always on the verge of exposure. And never will you be happier to have witnessed such brilliant performances all the way across the board set within a complex, intriguing storyline. Buy this movie -- it will be the best money you spend for a long, long time."
5,WATCH IT,"THIS IS THE BEST THING YOU WILL SEE ON TELEVISION. EVER. NO QUESTIONS, NO FANCY WORDING. JUST WATCH IT. IAN RICHARDSON IS AMAZING, THE REST OF THE CAST ARE AMAZING AND THE STORYLINE IS AMAZING. WATCH IT, WATCH IT, WATCH IT.NOW."
1,Too dark to see what is going on.,"I don't know who came up with the idea of shooting this series in almost total darkness. I find it so irritating I can hardly watch it. It is dark at all times. Let us see what is going on. We know Washington is morally dark but you can turn the light on and let us see the characters. Walking down to the basement in the dark is nuts and dangerous. Everywhere it is dark, dark, dark."
4,Good start,"I really enjoyed this series and liked the ""all episodes at once"" format. I have never seen the British version so I can't compare them."
3,House of Cards Comment,"I try to stay away from very ""English"" stories because half the time I don't know what they are talking about -- sorry, that's just me..."
4,Quality,"One of the best miniseries of the 90's is as relevent today as it was then. The BC does what it does best, namely qulity drama with great actors. This tale of political intrigue is well worth watching."
5,Melodramatic and Funny,The melodramatic and funny adventures of a backstabbing British politician who schemes to higher office with unanticipated effects. A very creative and entertaining series with superlative acting and convincing portrayals. I used the closed caption feature to ensure that I fully grasped the British accents and pronunciations.
5,A beautiful book that shares Dr. Parcell's knowledge,A beautifully written book that captures the knowledge and magic of Dr. Parcells and shares it openly with readers. An imperative reading for all people wanting to live better longer.
1,Live Better Longer: The Parcells Center 7-Step Plan For Health and Longlivity (Purchased on 12/11/2011),I donated the book. I found the information to be very outdated. I have focused on this topic for quite a few years and find current information goes way beyond this.
2,Hocus pocus?,"I'm not sure how putting water contaminated with chemicals under the light would get rid of its chemicals. I appreciate the fact that clorox can clean the outside of fruites and vegetables, but I don't think it can draw out the pesticides. One thing that I thought sounded wrong (or different from what people say today) is that Dr. Parcells said it's unhealthy to have acidic body, which is contrary to the majority of articles saying acidic body produces cancer. I like that Dr. Parcells had a natural approach to healing, but some of the things the book says, I don't really belive in."
5,This book changed the way I look at health.,"I am a massage therapist -- and I thought I had read and learned just about everything important in the field of health and wellness. But this book opened my eyes! I particularly enjoyed the philosophy of healing that it espouses. We are not just physical beings, but we also have emotional, mental, and spiritual bodies -- and all of them (they are all one, of course) need to be healthy. This book taught me, through the example of Hazel Parcells, that we all have to take responsibility for our health. But the great thing is that we really can do it! This book should be sent to every health professional in the country. I've already sent it to a lot of fellow massage therapists. Great book!"
4,Dr. Hazel Parcells was one of America's Greats!,"Joseph Dispenza tapped into a real gem with Dr. Hazel Parcells - she was a wonderful teacher, a very alternative healer and she brought Medical Radiesthesia to an entirely new level. Many think of dowsing as being too wowo. It is an art form that has been practiced down through the ages. We ALL have the ability to tune into our higher energies, those of others as well as those of our mother earth - we just don't realize it and often we don't know how to do it. Dr. Parcells practiced a very high form of ""muscle testing"" and made it a practice of helping people detoxify and heal themselves on the cellular level. This book leads us through Dr. Parcells 7 step program of health building and detoxification. Hopefully Medical Radiesthesia will not become a lost art in America! It is an excellent way of finding problems that are often difficult to diagnose and then finding the solutions."
3,Inconsistent - Great - Bad - Great - Bad,"When I first bought this record I immediatley fell in love with how much Moist had evolved on their second record with songs like Resurrection and Tangerine. User's passionate lyrics, and the grinding guitars created some great mosh pit rockers. However, the rest of the album is burried under the weight of the bands lofty goals. Hate is an uneven, jagged rock song that just doesn't work and the title track's chorus is so ludicrous that is loses any appeal(plus, the horn section just doesn't isn't happening). The standout track though is Gasoline, a laid back break from the mosh pit madness that signalled the bands descent into lighter sounding fare."
3,"Good album, but not better than Silver","Although the album is really good... especially Tangerine and Leave It Alone... it just can't be better than Silver. I was lucky enough to see Moist in concert for free at the CNE in '94 before they were really popular. I bought Silver when it first came out, so I knew and loved all the songs on the album before I went, so I had the time of my life. Creature, in my opinion doesn't have as much playability as Silver, which I still listen to on occasion."
5,This CD ROCKS!!!!,"I'd been looking forward to getting this CD for a long time, and it has proved to be one of the most intriguing, fun, loud, etc. etc. etc CDs that I have! Although I've gone through it once so far, considering I got it about 45 minutes ago (the fact that I'm writing this now proves how awesome it is!), I already love all the songs, from the rocking, get up and dance songs (Theme From Cola, Resurrection, Shotgun); to the mellow, meaningful slower songs (Leave It Alone, Disco Days, Gasoline); to the dark, threateningly truthful songs (Tangerine, Ophelia, Better Than You). This album has a great selection of songs, and awesome guitar lines. Favorites include Resurrection, Leave It Alone, Creature, Shotgun, Disco Days, Tangerine, Better Than You...ok, almost all the CD!! This is a must-buy!! =)"
5,Moist really did it this time,"Being Canadian I take pride in Canadian artists. But I would take pride in this band whether I lived in Toronto or Hong Kong. This is a really great CD, definitly worth buying.... I beg you go get this CD, you won't regret it."
5,Domination Masterpiece,"The Domination of The Draka series is a true masterpiece. Marching Through Georgia, Under The Yoke, Stone Dogs and finally Drakon. The alternate reality concieved from 1776 to 1947 for the first two, the balance of the 20th century for Stone Dogs and the final intergalactic battle in Drakon is an epic achievement. It is a real pity Stirling only wrote 4 books, the timeframe would have allowed at least 4 more! I think the concept of the ""master race"" or at least a race of Masters enslaving the world in a ""Southern Plantation"" stlye found south of the mason dickson line maybe politically incorrect, but the beliveability of the small time line changes makes it seem so real as an alternate outcome that might have been... I highly recommend this series!"
4,not quite the same,"Drakon is deffinatly a different novel from the three making up The Domination. Generic dimestore sci-fi on it's own, but its connection to The Domination and its steady pace will keep you reading. Drakon is a much faster read than the other books without the abundance of slow moving chapters but at the same time does not hold the same rich characters and moods. A good quick read if there's nothing else in the house."
2,I just gotta say,"These Draka are really repulsive (tho' compulsive reading). So that must be the reason why I plowed through and read the whole series in a few weeks. Even though I felt like taking a shower after finishing each novel. Maybe it's also because I'm someone who has lived in South Africa (twice), both during and after apartheid, and I wondered how a talented writer like Mr. Stirling would handle apartheid and Afrikaaners run amuck. Well, I found out. Definitely not for the faint-hearted nor anyone who doesn't like reading about man's inhumanity to man."
3,A Little Too Powerful,"A bit of turn from his earlier Draka series, this is a great book so long as you don't really ponder the plot too deeply. Gwen is just too much the superwoman to be believed and the plot is simply turgid. After awhile, it really starts to drag a bit. Nice beach reading, though"
2,Lost touch with the former novels,"After loving the former Domination novels, I found this one disappointing, an obvious answer to the question ""Just how would a Draka do in today's society?"" While that question is good for discussion, it made a poor book. It read entirely too much like the script for Predator II and too little like Marching Through Georgia."
4,Good guys win? Come on!,"Did Mr. Stirling's publisher told him that happy endings sell better than dark, brooding ones? Then the guy (or lady) should be fired. As far as complaints go, this was the only one I had when it came to Drakon. Gwendolyn is just too awesome to lose, too beyond the unaltered humanity's ability to handle.Even though the plot is fairly predictable - the book reads like a combination of Predator II, Terminator, and Omen - the author implements enough elements from the original trilogy to keep the old fans interested and newbies intrigued. However, I still would have been disappointed with the ending if Stirling did not leave enough room in the end for the possibility of a sequel, and I have a feeling that it is going to be better than the original."
2,Disappointing.,The locking mechanism on this pair of tongs is very difficult to use compared to that of EKCO tongs. As a result I have barely used them.
4,Nice for Non-Stick,"When I bought a nonstick cookware set, I had to retire all my metal utensils, including a well-used set of tongs. I chose this brand of silicone paddles for the locking mechanism, which is secure & easy to use, and the 9.5"" length, which gives me more control in manipulating food in large or small pots and pans.Alton Brown taught me how to use tongs as a substitute for a cooking spoon, spatula, pasta strainer and more. These do the trick & protect my nonstick finishes."
2,I can see why this was the last season of Vega$,"I rented this from the public library and I am glad this was nothing I purchased. I enjoyed the first 2 seasons of Vega$, but the third season was boring and slow and Robert Urich/Dan Tanna had lost his sexy, even his body wasn't in good shape and the hair on his chest just laid there all dull. I can very well see why ABC cancelled this show after season 3. It was all but over."
5,Thank goodness vegas is back,"I have been looking forward to season 3 despite this decadent policy of splitting the seasons vol 1&2. Naturally you can only do so much with a series before it grows tiresome but in the case of Vegas and being an avid fan of the show there were changes to season 3, bad guys got more malevolent and sinister compared to the previous seasons. They definitely provide a challenge for our titular hero Mr Tanna believe me I remember the reruns on wwor TV 9. The Andreas connection is a really good intense episode in which a villain captures Tanna after putting in Valiums in his food and our hero wakes up in a dark room,getting systematically tortured. the two hr special where Tanna is in Honolulu is superb in terms of action and suspense.I don't totally believe it was coasting the way another reviewer did. Dan Tanna will always be the action hero better then TJ hooker. Fans seem to forget Michael Mann created this great TV show"
3,So So,"The first two seasons of Vega$ had excellent writing & acting. The writing & acting unfortunately went downhill in the third season. That first 2-hour episode (with Lorne Greene & Pernell Roberts guest starring) was especially silly; the plot, the acting & the lines just made me shake my head in disgust. Things got better with the following episodes but it was easy to see why the show was cancelled after that."
5,Great music,"When I first listened to this I thought Jean Leloup was very arrogant to pass this off as music. But I gave it a chance. Suprisingly, I only had to listen to it twice before concluding that I LOVE this CD. Some of is songs are subtly complex, others just have great melodies, and his singing always compliments his engaging rhythms."
3,Not as good as I thought,The rubber in goggle is too hard for toddler. And the head band is quite fuzzy as it keeps moving.
5,Avicakes,My lovebirds really like these but there seems to be leftovers that they don't eat. They get the seeds out of the cakes but not the pellety surroundings.
4,Fun Treat,"These are healthier than the Nutriberries, assuming your bird likes the pellets. They're not the best, and many birds avoid them. Nothing more than molasses sticking together seeds and pellets, these are far from a healthy diet (what the package advocates). In moderation they are excellent treats, and the healthier manufactured and readily available treat. They are stretchy yet easy to pull at so they can be easily crumbled if need be. Also, they seem to give my Cockatiel a good work-out and she plays with them as well as eats them. Making them crunchy only requires letting them sit out for a little, then they become more like Nutriberries in nature. The downside is (because of the pellets, I suppose) is that they smell like animal feed (and not in a good way!) Opening the package is like a stinky punch to my nose. The only reason I buy the dratted things is that my Cockatiel really seems to enjoy eating them (or at least tearing them apart so she can fling the pieces everywhere)."
5,Review of Square Root of Someone,"This was a very interesting read, particularly since ""Anne"" Brandt (who I knew as ""Kim"" was a grade school classmate. Another classmate renewed our acquaintance and in updating me on many of other classmates told me about Kim""s book, which I ordered and read. Based on this book, I would and intend to read some of her other works.Jack Landoltjack,landolt@suddenlink.net"
4,"A must-read, especially for those who don't want to!","I found this book to be the missing link between the pioneering feminist advocacy of yesteryear and today's female-dominated pro-life movement. It effectively challenges the notion that feminists must, indeed CAN, defend abortion as a means of securing women's full emancipation.The book's credibility lies in the presentation of the information. Rather than simply asserting that our feminist forebears believed such-and-such, the editors present these women in their very own words and in full context, leaving no room for speculation about exactly what they said and why.This book ought to be required reading in every women's studies program, though the challenge it presents to neo-feminist orthodoxy is the very reason why it probably won't be."
5,I hate to floss...but this makes things so much easier,"This works well, doesn't shred, requires little floss for each flossing. Fast, easy, strong, lasts a long time...can you ask for anything more from a floss?"
5,2nd GREATEST PAY PER VIW OF THE YEAR,"ALBERTO DEL RIO VS KOFI KINGSTON-4/5SMACKDOWN ELIMINATION CHAMBER WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH-5/5TRISH STRATUS RETURNS FEATURING BOOKER T-3/5WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP-3/5VICKIE GUERRERO TEDDY LONG CONFRONTATION WITH KELLY KELLY LAYCOOL AND TRISH STRATUS BRAWL-3/5THE MIZ VS JERRY ""THE KING"" LAWLER FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP-4/5RAW ELIMINATION CHAMBER #1 CONTENDER FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP AT WRESTLEMAIA XXVII-5/5THIS EVENT WAS PERFECT"
3,this is NOT the lamp you will get....,"....but the one you DO get looks MUCH more expensive than the price paid here. it's taller than a table lamp should be...and not tall enough to be a floor lamp; guess ""buffet"" height would be a good description. black base is 2 1/2""; from top of black base to bottom of ""U"" going up into light (the ""weave"" design): 20""; then there's the ""U"" of 6"", then the lampshade and finial...you get the idea. NOT as squat as indicated here: ""weave"" is only 4 1/4"" across. bottom line: looks VERY cool; if you have a low table, this will work there."
1,WHAT A STINKER!!,"I was a big Thomas fan, but this has got to be one of the worst videos ever and it's due to Diesel. I've never liked Diesel since he's mean and he's tried to trick the little guys which consists of Thomas, Percy, Oliver, etc. Pop Goes The Diesel is about Diesel popping up everywhere and giving the steamies sour surprises is what I assume. In 2001, I sold this to a little boy at my yard sale who was a four-year-old boy. Since I'm eleven and I still have the models of Thomas & Friends, I like Thomas a tiny bit."
4,Omega 3 Supplement Review,"I use [...] to evaluate the contents and quality of supplements. They break down the supplement in the lab and evaluate contents versus claims. Swanson's received their approval. It was also reasonably priced compared to the other approved supplements in this category. I have been taking it for two weeks. There is no after taste or odor. It is a fairly large capsule but I have no difficulty in swallowing it. It has a lot date (08/10) but no expiration date. I guess this does not really matter if I am taking one a day as they will run out in a couple of months. It also arrived very quickly. I will definitely order from this vendor again. I hope this helps someone.Update: July/2012: Well, here it is a year and a half later and I am still using this product. I think I am getting a very good product at a very good price. Thanks, Swanson...and Amazon."
2,Has an aftertaste,"This product gave me an aftertaste for quite a while. Other brands didn't have the same effect, but when I tried this one, it did. I had to throw it away because of the ""repeat"" of fishy taste."
3,The Good Old Days,Remember those long lazy Sundays from the early eighties? After the Raiders won a game you could surf to other channels in search of easy-listening concerts. This is that stuff. classy 97
5,Mellissa Manchester Mania,This is Melissa at her best. The songs in this collection are some of my favorites. Take a listen and thank me later.
4,The Essence of Melissa Manchester,Lots of music on this CD. Over 70+ minutes. Some classic Carol Bayer Sager songs.
2,More Recycling,"A shiny new cover on a bunch of old songs. The tracks, even the ""hits,"" sound dated. If you want early 1970s pop retro, here it is."
3,original melissa manchester albums due out this year,"great news for melissa fans.her ""MELISSA"" arista debut will be reissued on CD June 19.Arista/BMG has launched a new catalog reissue label[BUDDHA RECORDS],wich will oversee the reissue of many original Arista albums.Tentative plans for ""BETTER DAYS&HAPPY ENDINGS"" and ""HEY RICKY"" are in the works for late 2001. We urge all fans to write or call BUDDHA RECORDS to show interest in these future reissues.[They are located at BMG in New York]."
4,Melissa deserves better!,"Manchester's box set is long overdue. The ""essence"" of an artist of such enormous talent and capable of such incredible musical diversity cannot be captured in a single disc. That is why this collection is less than perfect. As one of the most gifted singer/songwriters of her generation, it is a shame that her classics have to share space with commercial trifles like ""You Should Hear How She Talks About You"" (which, thankfully, she did not write! ). There are several outstanding album cuts that are not included. However, there are definitely some gems in this bunch: ""Caravan"", ""Easy"" and ""Come In From The Rain"" are the standouts. Let's hope Arista has the good sense to put together a box-set that does her justice."
3,Does not have beep feature,"The price is right, but I assumed I would be able to ""beep out"" circuits with this. That was a mistake. It's really odd for such a thing to be missing from a multimeter."
1,Not whats in the picture,"I ordered two of these parts because MOOG is supposedly good stuff. One was similar to the picture but had no zerk fitting. The other was completely wrong. I sent the wrong one back and they sent me one that had a nylock nut instead of a castle nut and still no zerk fitting. Also the top nut diameter was much smaller. At that point Amazon gave up and I sent both back.I then ordered two more from another place. One looked just like this picture, with zerk and all. The other looked like the second one Amazon sent. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaH!!!!!!!!!!!All the boxes look identical K9011."
5,Excellent Resource,Well worth the money. It'll take months to absorb half the data and I'm sure it will become a trusted reference guide.
4,Rastafai liveth!!!!,"Beautifully done, nuff respec' to the masses. Glad to see Rastafari fire still burning in the music realm. Powerful vibes ringing in every note. Give thanks and paraise to Jah Rastafari for blessings that I and I have received from such musical upliftment.Recommended to the youths - continue to seek Jah, he will never hide his face from the I.Blessed Love to the World - Selah."
2,There are better Trojan Comps...,Buy the Roots Box Set if you want Rasta Reggae. This one's kind of boring.
2,Manure,"Sounds terrible. Earbuds fit terrible. Glitchy. Sometimes the music skips like a record player. Manual is unreadable. Noise is audible during music play. You might as well just send $25 to a total stranger. I should have known better. A CHEAP 1GB player should be about $40, not $25.Sigh."
4,Preschool Fun!,"Even though this Barney DVD is only 30 minutes, it is still a great DVD for kids to learn from. My son is on summer vacation from preschool and this DVD is perfect for him (and my younger son) to stay on top of his letters, numbers, and shapes. Barney and the gang, along with kids, make learning look fun and exciting. Barney is a classic in our house and this DVD features great content, lessons, and songs!"
3,Stories of georgia,It was good I would let others know that they are the books that can be found on this site are not allowed to be found on others.
2,Not the best of More.,"I purchased this collection thinking it was similar to a tape I had of More's best hits. It was a bit ironic to see that More's best hits are not in this collection.The only ones I really cared for are track 14 and 16. The rest are just too monotonous, although original.If you buy this CD and listen to More for the first time, you are sure to miss out on the best of his works--not included here!"
3,OK but not my favorite of Beny,"This CD is OK but I disagree with a previous reviewer (agree with another one); this CD is by far not the best of Beny. I recommend the BMG Tropical Series ""The Very Best of Beny More"", Vol. 1 and 2, not only in song selections but in recording quality. I grew up in Cuba in the 50's and playing those two CDs is like going back to my teens listening to Beny on the radio. WOW...."
5,Adorable!,"We own 4 Beagles and of course they are our angels! Some of time the anyway :-) This is an adorable and well made ornament we use on the tree every year and when Christmas is over, it stays on the mantel for decoration."
2,not accurate,"I've been quite disappointed with this thermometer. :( I can take my teperature 4 times in a row and get a different result each time. The difference is slight albeit important due to the whole reason for taking a daily temp. Although the backlight feature is handy, it takes a while to clear the last temp and get a new one."
5,i can't believe anyone would complain about the beeping!,"if this beeping wakes your husband up or prevents you from falling back asleep i pray to god you don't have traffic going down your street in the morning! a passing car would make more noise than this thermometer! great buy, i've checked it against my glass thermometer and it's very accurate and fast. highly recomended."
3,"slow, annoying",Maybe it's just me but I think this thermo takes for---ever to take a temp! I use it on my little baby and often end up pulling it out before it finishes because it will hover on the same temp for what seems like 20 secs before finally beeping that it's final. Other cheaper and more costly thermos have worked much better for us.
3,Decent product,"The thermometer works well and seems to be accurate. The only thing I wasn't happy about was that the battery died after only a few weeks of being used once a day. I'm not sure if it was just a cheap battery or what but I'm hoping the new one lasts longer. All in all, I'm glad I made the purchase. And really, the beeping isn't that loud, unless your spouse is a verrrry light sleeper."
3,Great minus the beeping,"This is a great thermometer besides the beeping every 4 seconds. It's probably as loud as a watch beeping but when you're trying to sleep (my husband) it is annoying. It's also annoying for me when I am half asleep and have to hear it over and over. I do cover the hole with my thumb, but that feels awkward and the beeping is still audible. If you don't think you'll mind the beeping, this is an awesome thermometer. I love it otherwise."
2,Not a Basal Thermometer,This only measure temps to 1/10 of a degree & not 2/10 for recording BBT for monitoring your cycle. Would not recommend for those trying to use for BBT charting.
2,Worked great until it died,"Battery died very quickly for me - within a few months. Not sure if this is the norm for basal thermometers, but I went out and bought a Walgreens brand thermometer instead of a new battery, and almost a year later that one's still going strong."
3,Works ok,"I'm not sure if I just had battery issues, but often I would take my bbt and it would shut off before I got a result. I ended up not really using it much though, since I got pregnant before I could really track an consistent pattern."
2,Not basal thermometer,"The one I received has model number 403001, which is the same as a ""BD Digital Thermometer"" I bought recently. However it came with a instruction manual of Basal Thermometer. There is no difference in the two thermometers appearance and feature, which I would not have found if I had not purchased a ""regular"" BD digital thermometer. The seller was BD MEDICAL SUPPLIES."
4,"Although this product was easy to use, the ...","Although this product was easy to use, the numbers were a little hard to read. It did, however, give a correct temperature."
3,Worked well while it lasted,"Lasted only two cycles. Did its job while at it. All of a sudden it just gave up. Just gives out a low beep while I switch it on, but no display. It's odd for the battery to last barely two cycles. For someone who wants to chart her temp everyday, that's a let down. My next one wont be a Nexcare!!"
1,Mine didn't work.,"My thermometer wouldn't come on once I received it. I took the battery out and could only get it to come on if the battery was placed just right. Once I got it to come on, it wouldn't work properly. It gave the finishing beep as soon as I turned it on. The F doesn't flash to indicate that its ready. It didn't beep as it took my temperture, and never beeped to indicate it was finished. If it gives a memory reading (rare), it is incorrect (106.4?). Quite disappointing to receive a dud and have to deal with returning it and getting a new one.If I get a replacement I hope it works better than this one.I did get a replacement, and it works perfectly. If yours seems to malfunction, definitely send it back for a new one!As for my new, fully functioning thermometer, it is easy to use, doesn't beep too loudly, and is accurate and reliable. No complaints this time."
1,stopped working within two weeks!,"As long as it was working, I liked this product fine but it stopped working within two weeks. Further, when I requested for a replacement, the company representative told me to return ship the product for them to ship me a new one. Hassle! Hassle! I instead bought a new one from local Ralphs."
2,Beeping annoying,"I dislike that it beeps upon turning it on, and beeps every few seconds while it is taking the temp, and then beeps multiple times to indicate it is done. All this beeping is annoying to me (such an annoying noise that early in the morning!)and to my husband who mistakes it for his alarm clock---it wakes him up and is thus disturbing his sleep. A quieter product would be more welcome to both of us!"
3,Works but seems poor design.,"This is made to take your temperature before you even move to get out of bed, so why they would make the results not be illuminated is silly. You have ot get up and put the light on after taking your temp. Also it beeps endlessly. I hate the beeping. Why does it need to beep every thirty seconds to tell you its working? Just beep when its done. The beeping is loud and if you have husband sleeping its annoying. Otherwise I guess it does what it's supposed to."
4,Great thermometer except for one thing,"I was very pleased with the price of this thermometer. Upon receiving it, I liked the size and the functions, especially having a backlit display and a memory function. I was afraid the beeps would be too loud but they are fine.What I DON'T like is that the recorded temperature is not as precise as a basal thermometer should be. A basal thermometer should record to 1/100th of a degree (e.g. 97.83) instead of 1/10 (e.g. 97.8). This thermometer only records to 1/10th of a degree. This thermometer would be perfect if it only used a more precise measurement."
3,Received the Wrong Brand,"I received a Nexcare brand Basal Thermometer instead of a BD (Becton Dickinson) brand. The Nexcare one is fine, but it's just not what I ordered. It also only tells your temp to 1/10, not 1/100, which I thought this thermometer did. Overall I'm happy with the product I received, but it just wasn't the one I ordered. I purchased this on Amazon via Mr. Medical."
1,Beware of Seller!,"I would make sure if you order this product that you do not order it through eSource Wellness. My thermometer was simply put in a thin oversized envelope with no padding or protection. When I opened the envelope, the box of the thermometer was destroyed, the plastic protective case was shattered and the thermometer itself was just loose in the envelope. The company's website was not working so via Amazon, I emailed them on two different occasions about my order. This was two weeks ago and I have yet to hear back from them.The thermometer itself is functioning but I'm suspicious about it's accuracy. Regardless of the time of day, the reading is always 98.2 or 98.3. I ordered this thermometer because the one I bought from Walmart (different brand) fluctuated so much even after consecutive readings."
3,Good quality but annoying beeps,This thermometer works well. It's just that it beeps so loud in the morning. I tried covering the sound and it was still too loud for my husband who was extremely annoyed.
5,EASY TO USE,SUPER EASY TO USE. SAVES THE PREVIOUS TEMP JUST IN CASE YOU FORGET TO LOG IT. COMES WITH A NICE LITTLE COVER. GOOD BUY!!
5,Great BBT for charting,"I have been using this thermometer to chart BBT for a few months now and it has worked wonderfully for my needs. I bought it because it was recommended by the book, Taking Charge of Your Fertility, for charting for health purposes, TTA pregnancy, or for TTC. There have been a few times I wondered if it has been accurate but over a few months is has seemed to hold up and be accurate- as seen over time. When I did wonder, I would retest a second time, and it would increase a few tenths which would seem normal since it has already been warmed up somewhat from the first reading.I take my temp with it every morning and have since July 2011 and it may be close to needing a battery change but has not showed the symbol yet- but then again who knows when my toddler has been pulling it off my dresser and pushing buttons so I think the battery has been pretty good since it is now October. Overall I think it is a great product and have recommended it to friends who considered charting."
5,Works great!,"Love using this product to track my fertility, I recommend it to my friends TTC or for natural family planning! Great item!"
4,gets the job done,"This BBT works just fine. I like the pink color and the backlight which enables you to read the temp without having to turn the light on (ideal for early morning temp reads). It also saves the last temp taken, so I can quickly take my temperature and turn it off without looking and go back to sleep without losing my temp. It beeps every few seconds to let you know that it is reading your temp, and then beeps quickly three times when it is finished, and for a long time when you hold the button down to turn off the thermometer. The beeping is very loud and annoying. My husband sleeps through it, fortunately, but the noise is a little straining on my early-morning ears!The thermometer only reads to the tenth degree and not the hundredth, which is a bit of a bother if you want a more exact temperature for charting fertility. If your charts are all over the place temperature-wise I would recommend looking for a thermometer that goes to the hundredth degree."
3,Does the trick,"if you're purchasing this to take your basal temp for fertility purposes (which is done first thing in the morning, while your husband may still be in bed sleeping next to you), I'd get one that doesn't constantly beep while your taking your temp... otherwise, if the beeping doesn't bother you (or your hubby), it does the trick and the price is right."
1,seller delivered a different item,The seller delivered a different item.the seller gave us a fever thermometer and when we contacted them they told us they will send us a label to return the item back.its been two months and we are yet to receive it.from the reviews i now see that this has happened many times.if the item is not in stock then why send us some other product???so now we are not able to return the item back and we are stuck with this item which we dont want.waste of money.if you are ordering this product to use immediately then please buy from some other seller because a lot of mixups are happening.so save your money and buy from some other seller.
2,Dissapointed,My thermometer came with either a burnt out battery or doesn't work at all - I'll find out today when I try to replace the battery. It's a pain (...) either way though.
1,"Beeping is annyoing, not effective!!","This thermometer should be simple, but it is not. The last tempeture remains on screen for a long time and you have to constantly keep pressing the on/off botton to erase it, then it is not inmediately ready to use. Do not buy, waist of your money!!"
1,Useless as a Basal thermometer,This is NOT a basal thermometer. It only reads to the tenth of a degree...my normal thermometer does that. Temping for fertility is only useful if you can get to the hundredth of a degree so that you can accurately gauge your shifts. Waste of money.
4,Much better than the basic Target brand,This basal thermometer is easy to use and seems to be much more accurate than a Target brand I bought first. I like that it stores the previous temperature in case I don't write it down right away.
4,Best one we've tried!,"We have used 2 other thermometers and this is the best one so far. The light alone makes it superior because you can actually see the reading in the dark. Also, it beeps to tell you it is working which is great because with the others, I would just sit there wondering if they were on and mess up the temp looking for a light to check them. Finally, the on button is nice and big so it is easy to turn on.The only downside is it would be great if it read to 100th decimal. But, this isn't a big downside."
3,Not always accurate,"I purchased this product based on the great reviews I read. After using this product, I find it not be very accurate. I take my temp 2 times in the mornings, one right after the other and always get different read outs. Also, the instructions say that you get 3 beeps when it's done taking your temp, but I don't always get the 3 beeps at the end, even if I leave the thermometer in my mouth is little longer to wait for it. The product is okay, but I use it in conjunction with a mobile app, to track fertility days and with ovulation strips. Let's see how it goes, it's only been 1 week since I have started using this product."
2,Beeping is terrible!,"Although yes, it does what it is supposed to do and takes your temperature, its continuous beeping every few seconds for over a minute is entirely unnecessary. It wakes my husband up and although he does not get angry and knows it is not my fault he does get annoyed at the product (I would find it annoying if the positions were reversed). I am going to look for another product that does not beep the entire time it is taking my temperature."
3,"Works fine, but it's NOT the item pictured","While this thermometer works just fine, it's NOT a BD, which is what is pictured in the product image. It's a Nexcare 3M product. A respectable company, sure, but it's a bit of false advertising. I advise changing the image and the title for the description."
3,Comes in a different box with a different name....,"I just got it so I haven't used it yet but I rated it as ""ok"" because the product come in a completely different box and with a different name....I thought that was odd and confusing. I had to hold off using it because I was trying to contact someone about recieving the wrong product. Then I was told it's the same thing. THEN WHY DONT THEY CHANGE THE PICTURE OF IT WHEN YOU ORDER IT?!?"
2,Broken after 6 months of use,Stopped working after a few months of use. I will not buy it again. It is also very loud and would wake my husband.
3,Not too bad...,"There is a lot of beeping. This thermometer beeps every four seconds to let you know that it is still in the correct place. It also takes a long time, so that is a lot of beeping, plus a lot of fast beeps when it is finished. The display lights up, but only if you push the power button when it is done. But if you push the button for too long, it turns off instead. It's an okay product in that it works and i don't have much trouble with the display. It could be better, but it could be worse, too."
5,a good thermometer,"I wasn't too picky about my thermometer - just wanted one that worked! It seems to be quite accurate, and I love that it retains your previous temp (my last thermometer did not do this). Also, once tge battery dies it can be changed (also not true of my last thermometer)."
1,Not Accurate at all,Product is not accurate. Had to return it. It kept saying the temperature was 90.4. I highly doubt that's anywhere near accurate.
5,Love it,I love that this bbt thermometer beeps to let you know that it is in the correct position. Way better than my old cheap-o thermometer :)
4,Recommended,"This is one of the best books that I have seen on the description and care of the most common corals for the reef aquarium. It gives information on each coral such as Common name, Scientific name, Lighting needs, Water flow, Aggressiveness and Difficulty of care. This is not a book on ""how to"" setup a reef tank book but an excellent reference guide on corals and the proper care of these animals. Many great pictures and short but very informative descriptions make this a must have to the Reefkeeper. By the way, Eric Borneman (a.k.a. Eric Hugo) is one of the best known most knowledgable contributors on the Internet and reefkeeping Mail and Usenet Groups."
4,Allmost all the information you need on coral growing,"This book contains almost everything you need to know about corals growing except for things like method of feeding , what to feed , preferred alkalinity , disease diagnosis and cure . It covers the basic survival criteria - light levels , water flow preferences , degree of difficulty . The photographs aid recognition . Best I have seen so far but not quite everything you need ."
2,This book is not easy to use,This book is not what I expected. I thought it would be a good quick reference but it's not. The pictures of each kind are limited and I find it difficult to use to identify anything. It also has limited information on each coral. I would not buy this one again.
4,A cornucopia of Indian delights,"The recipes are on point. If you're looking for a serious cookbook with Indian delights from all over the country - this is the one for you. Warning: if you're looking for a pretty, coffee table recipe book keep looking - there are no pictures !"
3,Great for non-desis,"I bought this book thinking it had all the traditional recipes made the traditional way. But this book is more targeted towards Americans who don't know anything about Indian cooking.So while there's a big collection of recipes, there's still something missing."
5,Best single Indian cookbook.,"Some time ago I reviewed ""Feast of India"" by Rani and said that book would be the book I would have if I could only own one. That is no longer true. Neelam Batra's ""1,000 Indian Recipes"" is now at the top of the heap. Comprehensive, does a good job covering the various areas of India, recipes are well laid out, and the index is much more sensible than Rani's book's. It doesn't have as much about technique as some of the other Indian cookbooks, but it's adequate in that regard. Of course, a major strength of this book is that it has lots and lots of recipes ranging from simple to complex. The things I've cooked from it so far have been excellent. Well done, Neelam Batra!"
5,Wonderful Resource,"I have tried six recipes from this cookbook so far and each one has been a winner. The recipes are well-tailored to be healthy and generally pretty convenient to make (with tips for using modern appliances and store-bought spice mixes for when you are in a rush). The glossary is extremely helpful and it is very well organized. I have no trouble finding the section to fit where my taste lie any given day (vegetable curries? dals? street food?). The only shortcoming is that the index does not include the Indian names for dishes, which made it a little difficult to track down specific recipes. Otherwise, though, it is an outstanding, comprehensive resource on Indian cuisine."
4,Very comprehensive and comprehensible,"Great book. I have only tried 5 recipes, but they all turned out good. The book is written for people with little to no experience with Indian cooking and spices. Everything is in English, and most things are explained.My only two problems with it:1. You need a steam cooker for certain recipes (I was hoping to avoid buying one)2. Sometimes there's no description of what the final product should look like (no pictures either).Otherwise, very good."
5,Great cookbook,"I love this cookbook! There are so many really good recipes in it, and they are not too complicated. It is the Indian cookbook I reach for first."
4,Excellent recipes for vegans,"My husband and I recently became vegan for ethical reasons, and were faced with that difficult question: NOW what do we have for dinner? Then we found this book. Out of the 1000 recipes, about one-third are vegan, and all vegan recipes are clearly marked in the index for easy access. While some of the ingredients are hard to find, and some of the meals take a long time, this has been an excellent find for us. We've tried so many of the recipes, and they're fabulous. A must-have for any vegan!"
3,Lousy index,"Although the recipes in this cookbook that I have tried from this cookbook were good, it is difficult to find them because of the poor index. In a cookbook with 1000 recipes, this is a fatal flaw."
5,"Yes, there really are 1000 recipes","Excellent, excellent cookbook. Every recipe I tried was delicious, and I really, really appreciated that there were many recipes for the spice blends rather than reliance on commercially prepared curry powders and masalas. The only thing that could have improved this would have been some pictures, but the book is already several inches thick as it is. A huge treasure trove of Indian cooking."
1,"Disgusting, dishonest, misguiding","I bought this appalling piece of academic dishonesty misled by its title, which made me believe it would be a serious, scientific and educational material. What I saw instead, and there is no way I'll ever have those 2 hours of my life back, was an ugly (in every sense) show of religious proselytism, poorly trying to pass itself as science. I am perplexed at this man's nerve, misusing serious, respected scientists' names and twisting their words in such a shameless fashion. I didn't even try to get my money back : I just took some sturdy scissors to each disc and threw the pieces in the garbage, where they belong. I am usually against the destroying or burning of books and other intellectual works, but this is neither work nor intellectual, and it embraces and encourages ignorant arrogance in such a way that it would probably have benefitted from the flames. At least they might have crept some light into this obscurantist, self-important and tacky piece of crap."
5,CHUCK FULL WITH SCRIPTUAL SIMPLICITY,COVERS ALL AREAS WITH SIMPLE BIBLICAL SIMPLICITY. SHOWS OBVIOUS TRUTHS WITH CLARITY.
1,Author is a Bullshitter,"Author is totally full of bull and should be ashamed at how he has tried to scam the public. In fact, he should be full of terror over one day having to stand in front of God for the nonsense he passed around in his book. If I can track him down, I'd tell him so in person. PASS on this book & anything by this author."
5,Reclaiming Surrendered Ground: Protecting Your Family From Spirtual Attacks,"Very helpful book. I especially recommend that Pastors read this book so that they can counsel members of their congregation that might be struggling with demonic attacks. As Christians, we are very naive to the wiles and working of the devil. We tend to ignore the fact that we are in a spirtual battle. Until we are knocked down by the enemy, we don't do anything. So we fail to live in the victory Jesus has won for us on the cross. Jim Logan educates on how to reclaim lost ground and how to live in Jesus' victory for us. I think this book will be an eye-opener for many readers. I highly recommended it to every believer!!!!"
1,Best Stencil Book,"This is a spiral bound book of about 14 stencils. It's great for the 3-6 set, and probably older, because it's stencils of cars, boats, dump trucks, motorcycles, hot air balloons...all things that go...and best of all, it's an easy book for kids to use alone. I would love to order more of these boooks. I hope Tormont still makes them, and that Amazon will start stocking them again.But it beats me how anyone could be trying to sell a used copy of this book for 75 to 100 dollars. That's just crazy! 12 - 25 is more like it. IN fact, when my son is done with mine, I'll be happy- to give it away."
3,Great show! Not so great DVD.,"I Love this show.I owned the VHS and I really wanted to watch this show again, so I ordered it.After I did it, I checked the other customer's reviews.Too bad.This edition is not the one to get. Buy the one that comes with the Documentary!This one, is not horrible, but it is not great.It has a VHS image quality and stereo sound."
5,"Fantastic, non-stop fun and adventure!",Susan Sweet has a wonderful grasp of mystery and suspense. She keeps the reader on the edge of their seat with this superb tale of intrigue from the land down under. The characters come alive and pull you into their world. This story is the best mystery I have ever read!
3,Good in its day; now 40 years out of date,"Published 40 years after the Great War, this volume stood as the definitive volume for decades. Now it has been supplanted by a new generation of historians with far more detailed scholarship. For instance, the British Empire ace list is only about 60% complete, and there is no distinction between ""kills"" and ""moral victories"" which were credited equally. However, collectors will value this book as a landmark of the genre."
3,A fly in amber,"Fifty years on this nice little book on the fighter aces of World War One is dated to be sure. The men who survived the war - just in their 60s and 70s when it was published - continued with their lives for many more years. In some cases. new information has come to light. But, as a quick reference guide to the subject - which is really the mission statement of the Harleyford/Harborough series of books - it remains a good starting point."
4,"ultimately, a party dancer","The cd is great, but the case is broken. I had not remembered that being mentioned in the ad. I do love my dance party as I cruise down the road!!"
4,Great for Cardio Workout,This CD is all the good music of 1998. Fast paced and full of funtime memories. It is just right for doing cardio on the equipment at the gym. Gives you lots of energy. Worth the investment.
4,A good way to get a party bouncin',A couple tranks puzzled me... I mean this is 1998 right? But overall a great CD to move to. You just can't escape Puffy!
5,A totally different kind of message,"It's diverse, it's fun, and it's inspirational. New Voices New World is filled with great music that is bouyant and interesting to listen to, but more importantly the lyrics are positive and empowering. I get so tired of co-dependent, blaming, self pity songs. This CD challenges us to take responsibility for our own lives and to celebrate what we have created and what we will create. Scott's music get's me thinking, feeling, and moving and that is the highest praise I can give an artist."
5,Music For A New Day,"It's so refreshing to listen to music that's uplifting and lyrics that allow you to realize life can be better at any moment. In each moment we have a choice between negative or positive thoughts and Scott's songs allow you to hold onto the positive ones and let go of the negative ones.The CD is beautifully composed and the vocalists have some of the finest voices I've heard. The songs cover a wide variety of music and each one is guaranteed to make you think about your life and the lives of others.So if you want to make positive changes in your life I highly recommend Scott's CD New Voices New World. When you change yourself, you change the world. Let's all do our part to make this a Grand New World!"
2,Too grounded in Marxism to be pragmatic,"The author, to her credit, does have good contacts and spent time amongst the traditional people of the Choctaw Nation. However, her unrelenting Marxist approach to American tribal life is very grinding and does not expand her field of inquiry beyond the simplistic ""US bad, Indians good"" model that does not adequately address the complexities of the historical relationship between the Choctaw and multiple colonial and post-colonial societies. One of my own works is cited in this book, inaccurately, in my opinion.But if Marxism is the reader's basis for political theory, it would be a good read and source."
2,Questionable quality in a junk ear clip,"I picked up this pair of Phillips ear clips, expecting slightly better quality than their lower lines of headphones/clips. I also thought the in-line volume control would be a positive thing. I was wrong. While the sound quality was decent, with somewhat good bass for clips, the overall quality of equipment was cheapo junk. The ""in-line"" volume control was shorting out, and slight movement of the cord near it caused sound to cut in and out. Not to mention I believe the ear clips may not fit most peoples ears. They were way off on mine, and I found it hard to get a good fit. Most other brands seemed to fit ok.These sound decent, but suffer from bad quality with cheap parts. I came to find Phillips doesn't even make these, some third party company ""Gemini"" does. YOu can do better elsewhere, I do not recommend."
3,"no Tori Amos, but still very good","i am a big Sarah McLachlan fan, but she still is no Tori Amos or Rufus Wainwright, as much as i hate to admit it. she is a great singer/songwriter, but not the *best*.surfacing, also, is not her most intersting or diverse album. with the exception of ""Witness"" and ""Black and White"", you can't compare the album to Fumbling Towards Ecstacy (which is my favorite Sarah album).i'm reading some of the bad reviews of the album, and the one complaint i can't understand is that her voice is awful. yes, on the Blockbuster-Sony Awards thing, her voice kind of cracked, but she still has an amazing voice which can express her lyrics like no one else.. which is what a great vocalist can do (again, you can say the same of Tori Amos and her AWESOME vocals, or of Rufus Wainwright and his great vocals). otherwise, i can kind of (?) understand where people are coming from. but if you want some amazing music, get Fumbling Towards Ecstacy."
3,Certainly not her best work,"Although this album is good, it certainly wont change your life. Definitely a downstep from Fumbling Towards Ecstasty. I used to be a huge Sarah fan until I heard Tori Amos, Sarah doesnt even compare. If you like this album you will love Tori's first album Little Earthquakes. At any rate, this is a fine addition to your CD collection if you are a big Sarah fan."
2,hmm...really?? I don't see what the hoopla's all about.,"After getting ""Adia"" stuck in my head, I bought the album, but it struck me as terribly weak. Her lyrics are rather generic and there seems to be very little energy behind this. My friend Taylor told me she loved Sarah before she commercially exploded--that ""Fumbling..."" was a much better album, so I ordered it. I guess the reason I took her up on that is because Taylor's a much better musician than Sarah, in my opinion..."
5,"Excellant, Terrific, Awesome....","I first really listened to her album with my boyfriend and I was so amazed at her. I knew her from the ""City of Angels"" soundtrack but this album can leave etars in my eyes. I can listen to this album everday without getting bored from it. My favorite songs are 1,2,4,5,7,&9 -Matter of fact the whole album is worth buying."
5,One of the most beautiful CD's I have ever heard,"I have been a fan of Sarah Mclaughlin for quite a while.She is probably got one of the best voices in the music industry.The CD Surfacing is a beautiful piece of work.Sarah's songs all sound simply amazing.How one person can write such beautiful and music truely surprises me.When listening to this CD I could tell that she was singing from the heart.Some artists go way over the top with heartbreaking songs like Sarah's,but Sarah does it very much right.If you do not own this CD yet than go out and get it.It is worth every penny you have o pay for.A must have for anyone."
5,Sarah McLachlan's breakout album,"This album put Sarah McLachlan in the music spotlight that she definitely deserves. I bought this album because I liked her previous one, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, so much. Surfacing shows her continuing growth as a song writer and performer. Simply put, she is one of the best female artists making music these days.Most people will be familiar with the singles ""Building a Mystery"" and ""Angel"", both which are strong tracks. But, probably the most impressive songs on the album are ""Sweet Surrender"", ""Adia"", and ""Witness"". Overall, the sound quality of this CD is excellent. I like to listen to this album with headphones to get the full impact of the songs.I highly recommend this album to any Sarah Mclachlan fun, if you do not already own it. If you are unfamiliar with her work, I would use this CD as a great starting point."
5,If this is your first of sarahs get it,This is a really nice album for a first album listener.This album will inspire you to go and purchase more albums of herand compare the difference of which you most find interesting.Every album has a different touch.I highly recommend to start off with this one then go to the other ones.It is a worth a trybecause this album happen to be one of her well known albums inthe whole world.
4,I only give this four stars because . . .,"Sarah McLachlan is one of my favorite singers, and I like most of the songs on this CD. All with the exception of ""Angel"". I used to like it, but now the radio stations have gone to over-playing it. That made me mad enough, but the final straw for me hating that song was at the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards. She sounded like a howling alley cat that was in terrible pain. Poor Sarah! She must have been lamenting her choice of dress and makeup for the evening (it was gaudy and awful!) Other than that song, I would definitely recommend buying this CD, because Sarah McLachlan is still my favorite singer."
5,The voice of an Angel.,I heard the song Angel on the radio and then bought the CD on the strength of this one song. I was not disappointed. The rest of the songs are all great. I can't stop playing this CD from start to finish very time.
1,Not worth the package it comes in,"McLachlan's nice voice isn't enough to save it from it's seemingly obvious flaws, I'll keep it simple: Stupid, annoying lyrics; boring, popy music; uncreative; just another tradgic case of a talentless women with no talent trying to sing the blues...Don't buy this album!"
1,yuck!,"Pure and simple, as bas as Lynyrd Skynyrd! (And that is bad!). Give me some real music like Tori!"
1,it's so wack it kept me awake,so there i am listening to this woman singing after i heard how talented she was at writting and playing the piano and then i'm at song 9 and mentallt numb from boredom.she is wack and her music has no feeling what so ever.me shall nde ocello would take her to school.this disc is good for playing frisbe.
2,"All voice, little music","Fumbling Toward Ecstasy was a good album featuring well written songs and poignant singing. The new material on this disk has greatly decreased the emphasis on the music and focused primarily on the artist's voice, which is not a very good trade-off. In particular, Adia is just an awful song - there is no tune or melody whatsoever - and it simply features McLachlan droning on endlessly and pointlessly. Unfortunately, Ms. McLachlan has let her success and acclaim get to her head and she now feels she is such a superior artiste that, by and large, she can dispense with quality songwriting and instead put out songs that essentially say ""Look at me - I have such a great VOICE that I don't need to be interesting or creative and all shall still love and worship me."" In this case, success + ego = banal music."
3,"Good Music, horrible recording","I've been a big fan of the songs on this album for a long time and finally got around to purchasing this album. I had never heard this music on any real decent system before I purchased it. I have been very disappointed with this cd because it has tremendous amounts of dynamic compression that render the music flat and lifeless. Maybe i'm being a bit critical, because I do have a pretty good system with exotic audio cables and a high quality sacd/cd player, but this music simply does not sound good at all when played back at realistic sound levels. Sheryl Crow's Globe sessions sacd is an excellent example of a modern recording of female voice, the cd layer is good, the sacd layer sounds live. Surfacing is a not a good example.Summary: Good songs, Bad recording. Cd sounds like bad 128kbs mp3."
3,Mediocre effort,"This highly-anticipated and delayed follow-up to the breakthrough 'Fumbling Toward Ecstacy' (1993) proved to be mediocre at best. Although the Grammy-winning single ""Building a Mystery"", the successful follow-up ""Sweet Surrender"", and deliciously-quirky instrumental ""Last Dance"" (also Grammy-winning) are notable entries in her catalogue, the rest falls short as a set of phoned-in piano ballads, which (with the possible exception of ""Angel"") are utterly disposable. Gone are the superb vocals of ""Ben's Song"" (from 'Touch' (1989)), musical experimentation of ""Black"" (from 'Solace' (1991)), the lyrical edge of ""Possession"" (from 'Fumbling'), or the sheer power of ""Fear"" (also from 'Fumbling')?"
5,A Phenomenal Album!,"With songs like ""Building A Mystery"", ""I Love You"", ""Angel"", ""Full Of Grace"", and ""Last Dance"" you instantly fall in love with her 7th release. Her lyrics are beautiful and haunting and her voice is so beautiful. Also check out 1991's ""Solace"". Much better than ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy""."
4,"Very creative, true, deep, and original","This album displays love and loss directly and without all the coating other artists portay it as. It tells about real feelings and real situations. Building a Mystery,for example, is written to show how everyone, in their own way, covers up their true self. That is so true because everyone is afraid that if they show their true self people won't accept them. All of Sarah's songs have these meanings. These songs say and feel what everyone at one time or another says and feels. Anyone can relate and appreciate this album."
4,AMAZING,"What can I say? This disc embodies an amazing talent - Sarah is a goddess. I love this CD and I'd tell anyone to get it. ""I Love You"" is simply it - its amazing. I love this CD!"
5,surfacing,"i beleave that sufacing is one of the best CD's that i have ever listened to. I love the songs Angel, Adia, & Will you remember you. Her voice is soo easy to listen to, very soft on your ears."
4,Surfacing is one great album!,"I was never a big fan of Sarah Mclachlan until ""I Will Remember You."" Then the song ""Adia"" nearly put me in tears. Talk about an artist that can make you cry with her music. Sarah has a great combination of writing talent and an angelic voice. Most artists don't have both. Angel is the best song on this set but don't pass up Do What You Have to Do and Full of Grace. I sing them to myself often. This is great music that I would recommend for anyone who wants to relax."
4,Surfacing (McLachlan),This is a nicely arranged vocal album. Not your typical elevator music. Quite an enjoyable album by a superb vocalist and composer.
5,McLachlan's rare lyrical and musical gift,"This album is not to be missed, and will be prized by those who recognize the rarity of a true lyricist and ballad artist whose gifts are on par with the best. Amazon's review states that McLachlan ""is not prolific,"" which leaves one wondering about the reviewer's private definition of ""prolific."" The musical range of the cuts on this CD alone rivals that of Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, and others among our finest musical poets. ""Angel"" is a diamond, a perfect song, perfectly executed. ""Building a Mystery"" has an upbeat confidence and irony that are irresistible. Overall, ""Surfacing"" is further testimony that Sarah McLachlan is one of our finest popular performing and recording artists, a songwriter with real vision and a rare ability translate that into pieces that radiate identity."
4,surfacing-sarah mclachlan,"This is an album which I had on tape. No more tape players in cars these days, so I replaced it with a cd. The service was very good, prompt, well packaged and in Australia within two weeks. A great album."
3,"Not NEARLY as good as ""Fumbling""","I know this is the album that really shot Sarah into superstardom, but I honestly don't think it's nearly as good as ""Fumbling Towards Ecstacy"". ""I Love You"" is about the worst song I've ever heard. High points are ""Mystery"" and ""Sweet Surrender"" (my personal fave). As for the rest - well, I can do without it."
3,"Great album, bad recording","I really like this album, and have the 200g LP. I'm sorry, but this CD just sounds really bad. I'm not sure if its because of the ""enhanced"" feature or if its just a bad transfer to CD, but I was disapointed in the sound quality, A great album like this deserves better."
1,"too ""breathy""","God-awful CD from Sara. She sings like she is gasping for he last breath of air before being suffocated. This is a terrible D from a mediocre lounge singer. Terrible, don't waste your hard earned Money. In fact, if you received this as a gift, go trade it in for some real music, this is painful!"
2,SARH Mclachlan cd,This was advertised with no box but when the print work and CD cames there was no try card. Price was right however.
3,"""It's better this way...""","Surfacing by Sarah McLachlan is a mixed bag, some songs work and the rest don't. There are only 10 tracks but it's a lovely collection of piano ballads but I have to admit Sarah's voice does irritate me sometimes. Tracks I do enjoy are Building a Mystery, Sweet Surrender, Angel, Full of Grace, and Do What You Have to Do. The rest of the tracks are bit of a letdown especially the smash hit Aida, I could never get into that song! This isn't Sarah's best album, I would recommend Afterglow instead."
1,God awful,"Listening to this CD is worse than Chinese Water torcher! Come one people, you hand out 5 stars like candy! Sarah needs to hang it up, she has no talent what-so-ever. Listen to something real for a change. Something real is something other than this!"
5,One of Sarah's Best Musical Accomplishments,Sarah holds to her own unique style with this record. It is easily seen that she has reached a point of clarity in her life and her music is sure to follow :-)
5,What a CD!,"She's done it again! With soul-stirring lyrics and haunting melodies, this CD is one of the best I own. Her voice has a beautiful hazy quality only duplicated in her first album, Fumbling Towards Ecstacy. All of the songs on the album are very thought-provoking, but at the same time very calming. It's like yoga in your discman!!"
3,"Safe, but lovely","Sarah McLachlan, for all her talents, isn't one of the great female artists of the 90's - she doesn't have the originality or impact of PJ Harvey, Liz Phair, Lucinda Williams, or Fiona Apple, and that's because, unlike those artists, she doesn't take much risks, push her boundaries much, or flirt with offending anyone in the attempt to get her work across. Still, Surfacing, while it's only a little bit of a stretch to say it could've been made by Celine Dion, is suprising comfort food. McLachlan, make no doubt about it, has the voice of an angel (that song, ""Angel,"" may be an easier swallow if it weren't so successful in its cherubic minimalism - it gets played everywhere). So, on ""Sweet Surrender,"" ""Full of Grace,"" and especially ""Witness,"" she proves her gentle purpose."
2,"Humourless, banal","Some of Sarah Mclachlan's melodies are pretty, and as a pianist she's competent, but her lyrics always make her albums disappointing she writes in the most horrible cliches, and is obviously unacquainted with such concepts as wit. ""We are born innocent, believe me Adia, we are still innocent"" - does anyone actually buy this pretentious, flossy-headed muck? Is it meant to mean something?On Building a Mystery, things get really portentious...voodoo dolls, vampires, and other assorted bits of juvenilia.Comparing Mclachlan to Joni Mitchell is a profound insult to the latter, who could never have made something as hackneyed, artistically lackadaisical and full of mind-numbing gibberish as Surfacing. An alternative way of scrambling your brain is to place your head in a food processor."
4,McLachlan's Journey for Inner Peace is Stirring,"The poetic and soothing first track, Building A Mystery, demonstrates that ""Surfacing"" is going to be one of those CDs you listen to when feeling thoughtful or wistful. The album touches everything lightly and deeply at the same time (though never quite seems to penetrate the matter).With this album, McLachlan muses over serenity- and achieves a pleasant listening experience for her fans, you can feel her every thought fully and each song can open your mind (within the limits).Some of the best tracks would be ""Building a Mystery,"" ""Sweet Surrender,"" ""Adia,"" and ""Do What You Have to Do."" The second half of the album seems to drag a bit, though there are some tracks equally as steller..It's admirable, but not her best. I prefer ""Stumbling Toward Ecstasy"" over ""Surfacing."""
3,"Nice, but Sarah has better albums","It is a bit of a shame that this has become Sarah's most popular album. Sure, songs like ""Building A Mystery,"" and ""Sweet Surrender"" do put a heavy strain on a CD player's repeat button. But neither of these songs are in the same league as ""Drawn to the Rhythm,"" ""Into The Fire,"" ""The Path of Thorns"" or ""Shelter"" all of which can be found on Sarah's best album, the long neglected ""Solace."""
4,"Great CD, but it could use more happy songs.","I love Sarah McLachlan. She is very talented, and I love this CD. She has a beautiful voice and excellent songwriting skills. Alot of people said they don't like the lyrics, but I don't have a problem with them. Just one thing: I wish all the songs on here weren't so sad."
5,Sarah McLachlan- Surfacing,"I must start out by saying I was never a Sarah fan until I heard Afterglow and Surfacing pulled me in further after. This album gives off such a wonderful vibe. Emotional and thought provoking. It is truly amazing how realistic McLachlan is through her musical talent. Every time I hear one of these songs my heart jumps because of the love I have for the awesome music and, more importantly, lyrics. Here is a breakdown.Building a Mystery- 5/5I Love You- 5/5Sweet Surrender- 5/5Adia- 5/5Do What You Have to Do- 5/5Witness- 5/5Angel- 5/5Black and White- 4.5/5Full of Grace- 4.5/5Last Dance- 4/5"
5,The voice of an Angel.....,"Sarah McLachlan is without a doubt the best female performer in ages!! Innovative and every note she sings is from the heart. I have listened to this CD..Surfacing, repeatedly and will never tire of it, as enlightening as it is haunting. This CD makes you think."
5,I Love Surfacing!,"I have never bought an album by Sarah McLaughling before. I heard the song Adia on the radio and I was instantly addicted! I bought the CD and now it's my favorite. I listen to it all the time, but I never get tired of it. Every song is terrific. I definitely recommend buying it."
5,For the Dreamers...,"This Cd is so wonderful. For anyone wo enjoys the sounds of smooth and gentle paino playing and the soothing none screathing vocals of Sarah will love this Cd. When I finnally got around to listening to it I became addicted right away. ""Angel"" and ""What you have to DO"" and ebn ""I love You"" are my current favorite songs. Tghis song is for the dreamers who spend most of there time in their emtion (Like me) I love this Cd like mad."
5,An absolutely beautiful collection of songs :),"Sarah McLachlan brings the words that mean the most....and puts them with music. This cd is one of the most beautiful cd's that I have listened to and have admired. I especially like the song, ""I love you."" This cd is beyond a 5 star rating!"
1,She needs new material,"How long has Sarah been plugging these songs? She seriously needs some new material. Why purchase the album when practically every song is a single? As for the actual songs, all of them sound the same and are rather depressing. Not what I expected at all... I would rather get my teeth drilled then listen to the whole song. Every time I hear any song by her on the radio I cringe and Gag. Don't waste your money."
3,CD Case cracked,The Cd was fine but the case is basically unusable. I would have to say it was an okay purchase
4,"My best friend was right about ""Surfacing""","My best friend made me sit down one night and listen to Sarah McLachan's ""Surfacing"". I'm glad that she did. ""Surfacing"" has a consistant type of sound but every song doesn't sound the same. You can tell by listening to the lyrics that every song was written by taking an overflow of a certain emotion and adding a mix of strings and rhythm instruments that sets the mood intended. If you just sit back, close your eyes and listen to the whole album, you can literally feel the music."
5,Mainstream Sarah,"Yes, Sarah Mclachlan goes mainstream without losing its soul and never sold out, coz she never will, this is difinitely her most succesful record to date, though not really as deep as ""Fumbling Towards Ecstacy"" but its still a great record. The only track that takes time to grow on me is ""I Love You"" but later on I found out that its one of the strongest tracks, you just have to be patient with that one.and here's my top 3 fav. on ""Surfacing""1. Building a Mystery - its a very scary song, but somehow she makes its sound beautiful and unscary.2. Witness - She really pours her soul out on this one.3. Angel - I'll be damned if anyone will hate this song,overall I give 4.5 stars coz this is not as perfect as Fumbling Towards Ecstacy........."
3,5 Years Without A Hit,"Hard to say who has faded the most since their 96-97 heydays, Sarah, Paula Cole or Alanis. Their feminist-flavored ballads and Lilith Fair concerts lacked staying power. Oh well, Sarah's ""Sweet Surrender"" is a timeless near-classic."
3,pretty good,This was the first Sarah McLachlan cd that I ever bought.I thought it was great.Then I purchased her previous cd's and Surfacing pales a bit.The songs on Surfacing are not quite as good as the songs on her previous cd's.Surfacing is still a pretty good cd though and I would recommend it to a Sarah McLachlan fan.
4,Music for an Angel!,"My first experience with this album was on the airing of Buffy the Vampire Slayer's episode ""Becoming"", Part 2. Following the scene in which Buffy must slay her vampire lover, Angel, the haunting lyrics of ""Full of Grace"" began to play. The depth of pain and dispair portrayed in this song took my breath away. Unfamiliar with either the song or artist, I resolved to track it down on the net. ""Surfacing"" is worth all the trouble I took to locate it with such beautifully painted pictures as ""Building a Mystery"" and ""Do What You Have to Do"". A powerful, emotional experience which I enjoy reliving again and again. Sarah McLachlan is an artist for the ages. All ages."
4,CD-Sarah-MC,I purchased this CD for the song Angel but fell in love with several other songs. It is dark and and lonely and I absolutely LOVE IT!!!!I love Sarah's music she ALWAYS knows how to write and sing exactly what you need to hear.
4,"great cd, though on the short side","This cd is one of the best cd I have ever heard, though I like Fumbling Towards Ecstacy more. The lyrics of the songs ""Adia"" and ""Angel"" are very touching. The reason why I gave this cd 4 stars instead of 5, is the unnecessary enhanced cd option, which doesn't contribute much to this cd except for some cheap commercials of those other cd's of Sarah. Pity."
5,Wonderful Talent and Music!,"This is the first Sarah McLachlan CD I've bought, so I'm pretty new when it comes to her music, but I've gotta say McLachlan is definitely an artist worth listening too. ""Surfacing"" is a mixture of well produced talent and heart felt notes. I found ""Angel"" and ""Full of Grace"" to be among the best songs I've heard in my days of listening to music. (And I listen to music a lot.) Like Jewel, McLachlan has an originality and charm in words. ""Surfacing"" is also a great album to fall asleep listening to. It was worth more than the money I spent on it...."
3,on the bright side...,"This CD is nowhere near as good as Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and you can tell that Sarah was just looking for a break. However,there are plenty good points; my favorite tracks are ""Building a Mystery,"" ""Witness,"" (the one I listen to the most) and ""Full of Grace,"" which I think is just beautiful, if not very depressing. All in all, I am very glad I bought this CD, but I can't say that the effort behind Surfacing exceeds that of FTE."
2,The mystery is where her talent went!,"This CD is at best poor, at least by the high standards that Mrs. Maclachlan has set in the past. There are only two songs on the whole CD that stay true to her roots of creative lyrics and beatiful music, Building a Mystery and Sweet Surrender. The rest of the songs range from poor to average. I will definantly be selling this one to the used CD store as soon as I can."
2,Totally Bland and Boring,"I only like 3 of the songs which are ""Angel,"" ""Building a Mystery,"" and ""Adia."" The rest of this album is extremely bland. Both the musical arrangement and vocals are unimpressive."
1,Only a couple of nice songs,I bought this c.d. but when I played it I was disappointed. The music didn't do much ;it was just very blase .The lyrics try but didn't succeed; and sarah was trying too hard to be profound ; it backfired. I don't recommend this c.d. buy a Celine Dion c.d. instead you'll be more fulfilled.
5,One of the greatest albums I have heard.,"This is definitely one album I could listen to over and over!! 'Surfacing' deserves MORE than 5 stars. From the first song, 'Building a Mystery', I knew this was something good. You've got upbeat songs like 'Sweet Surrender', 'Black and White' and 'Building a Mystery' to sadder ones like 'Angel' and 'Full of Grace', to those in the middle like 'Witness'. 'Angel' is the most beautiful song I have ever heard; I cried when I heard it for the first time. Sarah's songs struck me deep in my soul, and made me feel. I don't think I've done that with any other albums."
4,Surfacing is a GREAT work,"I was eager to get this cd. I loved building a mystery but with the song Sweet Surrender i wanted this cd badly. i am a big fan of up tempo music, but this cd is sometimes a little bit bland, but the great lyrics make up for it.when Adia and Angel became two of her biggest hits ever, i was so happy. No one should miss Sarah Mclachlan, she is a true genius. but i reccomend Mirrorball-it has all her songs, and i think she is almost better live than in the studio."
2,Not as good as Fumbling Towards Ecstacy,"What can I say? Being a huge Sarah fan BEFORE this CD came out, I expected something similar to Fumbling Towards Ecstacy. But this CD finds me a little upset that Sarah has taken this road of pop stardom only to lose the most captivating parts of her music to pop tunes. I think it's kind of sad myself. You should listen to Fumbling Towards Ecstacy or any of her previous stuff."
2,too sweet for my tooth,"Thank God my sister bought this CD, or I would have been 14 dollars lighter. Sarah McLachlan has a beautiful voice, but her lyrics found me wanting (Why does it seem that lyrics are just an excuse to show off a woman's voice?). For example, ""I have a smile stretched from ear to ear""? That sounds like the diary of a teenybopper. I bought ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy"" later on and found that it was much better than ""Surfacing"". Ah, well, it's bad but not as bad as Jewel."
4,Cd's content shifts from sorrow to an healing angel.,"The cd includes tracks that are depressing,uplifting,and healing.The song Angel expresses an special interest to me.No matter what happens,no matter what the world may dump on you...You can find your focus in the arms of the angel.She has an incredible mellow voice.I recommend it to everyone."
5,No one is allowed to talk to me when I play this CD,"I Love this CD, all fans will get their money's worth. Every single song is worthy. I love that woman's voice and ability to put great instrumental to her lyrics. Sarah, realizes that you don't have to shout to get attention or sing about every life experience. This CD reflects my current life situation and is very touching to me. My 6 year boy loves her music too in fact when I sing the lyrics too loud he tells me to be quite so he can sing them too. It is a very nice place to go. Excellent, I've been listening to this CD continuously since I purchased it last year."
4,"A good CD, but not as good as the ones in the past","I thought that ""Surfacing"" was a pretty good CD, but the best album of all is ""Fumbling Towards Ecstacy."" In ""Surfacing"" the best songs are ""Do What You Have To Do,"" ""Full Of Grace,"" and ""I Love You."" The other songs aren't as touching as those. Sarah did a good job, but ""Fumbling Towards Ecstacy"" will always be the best!"
5,She could do no wrong.,"Sarah McLachlan is a genuine talent- a spooky talent. Her voice in this recording is full of shades and depth, musical perceptions and melancholy echo. From the simple yet amorphous ""Angel"" to the bittersweet ""Adia"", her voice travels through this album like a tourguide through the inferno. This is a spectacular album, compulsively hearable, haunting and magical with mystery. A deeply felt triumph."
4,My Mystery is Built,"Ms. McLallan has proven to me that she is a true talent! I must admit I knew nothing about her when she first arrived on the music scene, but now I'm happy I got the chance to finally feel her music!Her words come from her soul on this one and it's plain to see that she feels every word she says and every note that she plays! My favorite song was Building A Mystery and from that song along I was hooked on Ms. McLallan like crazy glue! She is a true talent and if you get her c.d. it will shine brighter then the sun outside!"
3,"Lush songs, but not nearly as strong as previous albums.","I really love Sarah. ""Possession"" (from her breakout album *Fumbling Towards Ecstasy*) caught me and I've been stuck on her ever since. Her voice is one of the best out there, and one of the few female singers left that can (gasp) WRITE AND PLAY THEIR OWN MUSIC! I couldn't wait for *Surfacing*'s release. And...well, I was disappointed. It really is a beautifully dark album, but nothing here compares to the strength found in ""Possession"", ""Hold On"", and ""The Path of Thorns"". It makes for a lovely listen (with my favorites ""Sweet Surrender"", ""Witness"", ""Angel"", and ""Black and White"") overall, but it's not as good as *Fumbling Towards Ecstasy*...Besides, she used the word ""yearn/yearning"" just too many times in ""Do What You Have To Do""."
5,Magnificent CD,"I feel embarrassed to say I have never listened to a Sarah McLachlan CD before. But based on the reviews on Amazon I bought a copy of this CD. What a great CD. I can't play it often enough. The enhanced CD is great as you get 2 tracks off each of her last four CDs. Good marketing ploy, as I am likely to buy some of these CDs."
5,one of the very best,"Sarah McLachlan sings with unusual pureness. There is a sense that what she sings is something personal to us, which makes it all the more enjoyable. At times on this CD, there are literally moments of near musical perfection, where her voice, the lyrics and music all unite for something that is truly breathtaking. I love the songs and music. That she writes her own music raises her in my eyes above most singers today. She is a true artist. If I were sentenced to listen to one CD for the rest of my life, I dont know if I would definitely pick this one, but it would be in the running. That says a LOT."
4,McLachlan's Mystery,"Overall, this is a pretty weird album. But nevertheless, not dissapointing. ""Building A Mystery""'s lyrics are totally way out there, but the music's pretty cool! ""Sweet Surrender"" is my favorite song on the album. They lyrics are deep, and the music is fast paced and great for dancing. I feel that the song ""Adia"" is sort of an anthem for divorced housewives. It's a song about a failing marriage, but still captures innocence. ""Angel,"" my second favorite, is a soft piano tune about how you can find relief from the pressures of life in the arms of an angel. ""Last Dance"" is a perfect finale for the album. It sort of reminds me of walking through the woods on an Autumn night. This _is_ a pretty cool album!"
4,toe separators,I found them to be soft enough for between the toes. What I was looking for was individaul toe separators but I guess they are not made anymore. I took these and cut them into individuals. They work great.
4,they do,they are just like the ones at the spa. They do what they do with great colors. My grandaughters loved them.
2,edible pearls,"they are MUCH lighter in person almost like they had sat in the sun for along time,a dirty pale pink color.notat all like they looked on the website and so hard that I would be afraid of breaking a tooth on them!"
5,"Beautiful, quiet, and inexpensive","This really jazzed up my rig. I bought 4, and I'm impressed at their low noise level, low price, and beautiful green glow. I haven't taken any temperature readings, because I'll be honest, I just wanted them for the pretty lights!"
2,Good smoke generator while it lasted,This thing worked like a charm for about four months. The smoke was perfect. I loved it. Then it started feeding the smoke biscuits continually instead of one every 15 minutes. I took it apart and couldn't get it to stop. Probably a lower tech approach to smoke generation would work more reliably.I've seen a few other brands and models on the market so I'll try one of those.
4,It works!,"This is a digital delay. As such, the sound is crisp and clean. By twiddling with the knobs you can go from 0 to 800 ms in delay. I basically use it for two sounds: Rockabilly echo and spacey trippy. You can get it to do other things, but it does these well and I don't really use it for anything else. Sure it's not analog, but it gets the job done. I got it at one of the Amazon affiliates for a great price, so scout around before you pull the trigger.Overall, list me as satisfied."
1,Boss fails on warranty,"I bought the DD3 a few months ago. It worked OK for a few months, then the delay section just died. We have been using this unit in studio the whole time with controlled power input, so the only possible cause of failure is an inherent defect in an internal component. The unit comes with a 5 year warranty. I called the Roland / Boss warranty department for an RMA. Here comes the problem. The 5 year warranty is on parts only. You have to pay for labour at 40 dollars an hour plus shipping and handling both ways. So if they take 2 hours to fix the unit and add 20 dollars for shipping both ways, I would be paying 100 dollars under warranty to fix a unit that costs about that new.If you are contemplating buying a DD3, keep in mind that the supposed 5-year warranty only covers parts after the first 90 days and is in my opinion therefore worthless."
4,It does the job at a great price,"If you want simple delay and you don't need stereo outputs, this is the best pedal for your money--simple, solid, and virtually noiseless."
4,There are no 5s,"Awesome pedal. Must admit I purchased it after seeing Bonamassa's pedal board, and all the reviews were positive and true. Again, no real complaints here."
2,Failure After Infrequent Use,"I bought this about two years ago and then put it away as I didn't have a use for it. Pulled it back out this week to fire it up and the switch is broken, won't stay on. Less than 3 hours of use, and it's toast. Local Boss repair place quotes a minimum $95 fee to replace the switch. Nice sound, but inferior components. Burned."
1,Never Worked,I bought it and it never worked straight out of the box. The needle gets stuck about halfway.
3,"I have not heard this CD, but . . .","I have not heard the Lee Dorsey album WHEELIN' AND DEALIN': THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION. But, reading the song titles, how can a ""definitive"" Lee Dorsey CD exclude his original versions of ""Yes We Can"" and ""Sneaking Sally Through The Alley,"" which, years later, were hits for the Pointer Sisters and Robert Palmer, respectively?"
3,THE NOT SO PERFECT HUSBAND,"INSTINCT TO KILL is based on Lisa Gardner's ""The Perfect Husband,"" although in this film one would never guess that. Tim Abell plays and quite well, a psychotic cop who has murdered nine women, and who failed in his attempt to murder his wife (the lovely if challenged Melissa Crider), and has been sentenced to an institution for the criminally insane. Needless to say, he escapes and begins searching for his wife for ultimate revenge. Ms. Crider is referred to a freelance defense instructor, played by Mark Dascascos, and he agrees to help her ready herself to defend herself against this psycho spouse. Kadeem Hardison (who worked with Dascascos in the excellent DRIVE) plays the former partner of Abell, who helps in rounding Abell up.What follows is fairly predictable, and often times sadistically cruel.Abell is the real star of this movie; his cool abandon in the murders is chilling."
2,OH PLEASE,"Good? Not. Corny? Yes. Predictable plot holes? Yes. The scene where the star and his ""comedy"" relief (KAdeem HArdison) are handcuffed and then left to die by the cops, is excruciatingly long. Does it take that long to be left on the side of the road? Did the director need to strettccchhhhh the scene to fill out the feature length run time? The implausible escapes and awful scenarios are putrid. The star is likeable, and just needs a decent script and a director who has actually made action movies. Two chop sticks down, baby."
3,replacement,"Lenox charges $7.50 total for a replacement. This is not the pattern that was broken but since it is part of the 4 for 3 promo, it will have to do."
2,Why get Travel Size?!?,"There is really no reason to use this Travel Size version of the Glide Floss, when the Full Size version is just as space efficient, but is more convinient and less expensive to use."
4,satisfying album,"The best track for me was La Ritournelle, a piano and string baleric electronic round, fully orchestrated, perhaps a bit over-produced, but then listening to it at four in the morning it did not seem to matter. It's a good album to loose yourself in. Note that Tellier's work ""Fantino"" also appeared on the soundtrack to Lost in Translation. He was picked up by Air for their label."
4,La Ritournelle is the track of the year!,"I heard La Ritournelle at the Big Chill festival and it is beautiful. Smooth strings, hypnotic beats and eerie vocals at the end.It reminds me of similar material from Glideascope."
5,Outstanding Book....Great Inspiration!,"I first bought this book in paperback form at the PX while stationed at Fort Hood. It was a long and outstanding read! I understand that there are some things that Mr Mandela may have decided to leave out i.e.: his linking to various political uprisings against the aparthied government. I wish that he would have discussed that part of his life more. Nonetheless, this book tells the story of a man who came from humble beginnings to become the first black president of post-aparthied South Africa. I had to buy copy of this book for the Kindle. If you want a piece of modern history, and a good long read as well, get this book. I recommend it to everyone!"
4,great men can write!,"it is a very humourous and (I guess) honest book. He tells his tales as a child, and the innermost changes that led to leadership.Interesting AND entertaining!Greetings form Argentina!"
5,Inspirational Person and Book,"This is the type of book I could not put down. I knew only of Mandela's name and elementary accomplishments going into reading the book. I found his telling of his life to be exciting, for good and ill. Although I may be somewhat biased in my praise of this book, due to my lack of knowledge of any other view other than Mandela's about Mandela, it is probably safe to day this is a book well worth reading."
2,"Good Guy, Bad Book","Ya, sure Mandela is a great person, a personification of a accumulation of moral and ethical supremeness, but lets face it, this book sucks. I had to read this for a high school english class, and it bored me to death. So many facts, so many potentially useless information, its as if Mandela intentionally tried to put emphasis on the less entertaining portions in his life. Personally, I dont see how all the other commentors could stand finishing this book. Good story...badly written."
1,Very subjective and propagandistic,"For anyone who really wants to know the truth about the seperate development (Apartheid) concepts of the previous South African government, this is definately not the book to read. If you want to learn more about the man Mandela from the point of view of the millions so called oppressed people in South Africa, then this is it. It gives a very subjective view of the situation as it was at that time in history, but describes the man Mandela as the world sees and expects to see him - the smiling saviour of the South African Black people. The fact that he wanted to achieve his goals with terrorism and crime and that people still suffer today, after the creation of the so called democratic South Africa, because of his legacy of violence is discussed nowhere in this book."
4,Inspiring,"Here is a man who fought his entire life for the freedom of his people, including 27 years in prison. An inspiring story that I didn't know much about until I read this book. A little long and detailed, but I definitely have a greater appreciation for this man and his struggle. If you don't know the story of Nelson Mandela, you should read this book!"
5,"This is not a book about a man, but a Manuscript for Life","Please allow yourself a moment to Think before you turn the first page of this manuscript: Think about your name; Think about your family; Think about the warmth of sunlight on your skin; Think about the gift you have to think; Think about things you love and tastes you cherish most; Think about someone you would never wish to live without;and then Think for just a moment, about the cause for which you'd be willing to sacrifice all of the above and so much more for a period of indescribable sufference of spirit-breaking duress. Such strength of mind is perhaps too rare for most of us to even contemplate, however welcome now to the mind that could.This manuscript is one of the most important pieces of literature ever laid to ink - cherish it and use it to make your own world a little wiser."
4,The Nice Brisk Walk,"This book, A long walk to Freedom, was undoubtedly a very well written book. The life of Nelson Mandela appeared in vivid colors and it was simply amazing. I very much enjoyed the stories of Nelson going through schooling, and most of all I enjoyed the very ending of the book because it had the most amazing quotes to ponder. I wrote them down right away. This book is definitely one to recommend because it is real. The details add significance to even the littlest occurrances in Nelson Mandela's life. Simply it was a fantastic story about a strong man fighting for his freedom. He had the will to survive. What more of an inspirational book could someone ask for!"
5,The Best Bio Ever!,I can't say enough about this book. It is the type of biography you want to listen to over and over because it is so inspiring. Mandela showed great ability to hold to his vision of a free South Africa even while he was jailed for 27 years. Mandela writes about his whole life: the death of his father at an early age; his days as an intractable youth; his years of growing political awareness and activity; his imprisonment; and eventually his triumphant return as his nation's president. Danny Glover's voice only adds to the richness and largesse of the narration.
5,An Excellent Read!,This is an amazing book on survival despite overwhelming diversity. It helped my Godson tremendously. I recommend this book to everyone.
5,Inspirational,What an amazing life of dedication to humanity. Nelson Mandela is a true man of honor and strength of character.
5,"Fantastic, Fascinating","All of my students (all white, all American) love this book. Some say that they haven't read anything like it in the past."
3,My Nelson Experience,"It is tough to say whether or not Nelson Mandela's ""Long Walk to Freedom"" was a good book. It is mostly based on historical fact and lacks the intimate personal feelings that one would expect from an autobiography. Some chapters seemed to fly by while others were tedious to get through. It is probably not a book that I would have read on my own time (I was assigned to read it in school). I probably would recommend this book to people who have a strong interest in South African History (particularly in Mandela's sturggle towards freedom). Although he does a good job at explaining all the political organizations, I still found it difficult to keep them all straight.Overall, this was an ""ok"" book, but nothing extraordinary."
5,inspiring,Danny Glover does a wonderful job of reading Mandela's remarkable story. Excellent. It has soul.
5,Love buying from this vendor!,"The book I ordered, LONG WALK TO FREEDOM by Nelson Mendela,was even greater than I expected! It was in perfect condition,and was a hard back copy, which I had not anticipated! I will keep this book in my library forever!!"
5,Good Reading,This gives an insight into the South Africans struggle I respect Mandela more but I will like to read other books about him writing by someone with a balanced opinion. Then I can fully appreciate him. But his views and thinking are very clear and pure even reading what he wrote about himself you can see it clearly reading between the lines.I know that he sacrificed a lot I am not sure that there are many people that could do what they did. But like he said in the book maybe extreem hardship will bring out such character but I believe that you have to have it in you for it to be brought out. I think that all those freedom fighters have it in them. We have seen people that less hardship brought out the worse in them they became criminals we see it everyday
5,Absolutley brilliant,"We often forget that world can be changed and that we should learn to live with unfairness. This book it's a fun, interesting and learning experience, but above all, it reminds us of the cost of freedom."
4,History Made Interesting,"I have long admired Nelson Mandela - as a matter of fact, he is a part of the reason I started my charity - Building a Bookshelf. I have wanted to study more about his life for a long time, and finally got around to it. Although this book is by no means an easy read, it was consistently interesting and kept me turning the pages to find out what happened next. I learned a lot about both Mandela and the struggle in South Africa. This is history at its best."
5,Amazing book,"This account of Nelson Mandela's life is brutually honest. A complex and totally inspiring person.One for everyone's bookshelf. It really is essential reading for anyone in any country of any race, religion or political persuasion."
4,A Valuable History Book....,"As an American Teenager, I remembered hearing about Mr. Mandela being relased from prison. I remember thinking, ""wow, he was in jail a long time"" and that was about it. Many years had passed and I watched the movie, ""Invictus"". It was from this movie that a real fascination for Mr. Mandela had developed. So as I often do I looked to see if he had an autobiography and found this book.My first thought when I started this book is that I am going to get lost in the geographical aspects, tribal names, and the many associates of Mr. Mandela but I powered through. I am so glad I did. Not only is the book a good history book on the struggle of an opressed people but an entertaining story as well.I found myself taking notes on things he said that make great quotes for everyday life. That's what type of book this is. A book that you want to remember because you can use his wisdom in your life."
1,bad customer service,"I received a wrong kit, I called 4 deferent places to return or get to the right ket. Yet the order is not right. It is coasting me a lot of time and money."
5,Back Flow Rebuild Kit,The product was shipped on time and was exactly what was needed to repair the sprinkler system.
5,The Dictionary of Americanisms by Mathews,"This is the perfect book for the journalist or writer in your home. It will appeal to a wide constituency of academicians.In essence, the author shows how American linguistics contributed to the English language development over the years.For instance, the word alumnus is defined as a graduate of acollege. Its earliest use was traced to Sewall in 1696.There are pictures throughout the volume. i.e. the Baltimore Clipper fascia together with an extensive description.The work concludes with a fairly comprehensive bibliography.This would be a good purchase for the academician in your house."
5,SUPRA PLUS WIRELESS HEADSET WITH LIFTER,"Everyone in our corporation loves these headsets. The clarity and being able to walk away from your office is a definite plus.The only problem we are experiencing is on the lifter, the double sided sticky tape lets go.Outside of that, it is excellent."
5,QUALITY PLUS which is hard to find these days!,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZWBTE/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleIT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY, IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT, DON'T HESITATE ,"
2,"Uncomfortable, avg quality","This unit was too uncomfortable to wear for extended periods. It is designed for people talking constantly, not for someone in big phone meetings just listening in and speaking a couple times during an hour-long meeting. The mute button is a bit difficult to engage and the beeping when on mute is annoying if you stay muted for long periods of time. The sound quality is okay, but not fantastic. The range was okay - didn't have any problems within my building."
4,Does the job and works really well...,"I've been using this headset to dial into meeting every day since it arrived. I'm usually in these meetings in one (1) hour chunks and I attend two (2) to three (3) hours of these meetings per day. The headset is crystal clear and I can easily understand the conversations on the call. I really like the mute button on the side of the headset and the tone it provides as a reminder that you are on mute. Overall I find the headset to be pretty comfortable, very easy to use, and ergonomically the ability to adjust the thing is great. I had no problems at all connecting it to my desk phone and once charged it worked right out of the box. I'd recommend this headset to others who are looking for a reasonably priced solution."
1,So So BAD!...An Embarassment,"My toes literally curled as i read the awful, campy, porno prose the author cooked up for this pathetic All About Eve retread. Not a single interesting character, awful, awful dialouge (like listening to 17 yr old queens in a piano bar) and a clankingly unoriginal plot stolen from a great movie. Lots of typos too..as far as I read since I couldn't finish this tripe. What an embarassment that this is a ""gay novel."" Makes ya wanna go straight!!!"
4,Nice easy entertainment read,"Sometimes you read to expand your thinking and if that is what you are wanting then do not get this book. However, most of us love to read to take us out of the current world we live in for a period of time and just be entertained. ENTERTAINMENT is what this book is made up of. Ben Tyler is by no means the best author out there but does sweep you up in a story that you forget how long you have been reading. The images come to life in your head. Someone said they could not wait for the movie. I totally agree the images and events are so descriptive and come off the page.The story is written around the ice skating world. There is humor, steamy sex scenes and backstabbing bitchness around every corner and I could not stop from turning the pages. I would totally recommend this book for a good entertainment read."
4,Pure Trash,"I loved it. If you like mindless relaxing reading full of adventure and lots of hot sex, this is the one for you."
2,Tyler On Thin Ice !,"I had been looking forward to getting to this title, however, after reading it I was quite disappointed. It's just an ""All About Eve"" rip-off. Our lead character, Tag, will do just about anything or anybody to make it to the top...you can figure out the rest."
5,"good, solid, clothesline","I use it mostly for hanging wet quilts to dry and saddle blankets, and it is strong enough for that."
5,Great Clothesline!,"I Love the Clothesline! It's so nice to be able to go out, pull the lines across the back yard, hook it & hang the clothes out...I'm saving money on the elctric bill, doing my part to 'be green', killing any residual germs in my laundry while making them smell so good, getting fresh air & vitamin D and getting that much needed mini-workout...WOW! What more could you ask for? This is a pretty cool device...they've apparently gotten most all of the bugs worked out of this ones...I haven't found one yet."
3,Good!,"I didn't know before purchasing this book that it didn't come with a cover. It is a hard back, which is exactly what I was looking for. Other than the ""missing"" cover, the book was a great buy!"
4,Little Sarah,"My heart went out to little Sarah. Throughout the entire book I was hoping she would come back to the world and say what happened to her and what she has witnessed in that cave. The images of her following her older sister to that den of death are haunting to say the least. Sarah in her own little world seems acutely aware of what is happening but is powerless to stop it, although she is desperately trying in her own way. The Sarah character in my opinion is one of the BEST characters ever thought up in the world of fiction"
2,Great Story Until The End,This was the first Saul book I read and I was captivated with the story to the point where I couldn't put it down. Then I got to the end. Like another reviewer said absolutely nothing was resolved. Why bother telling the story at all if there won't be some kind of conclusion. To me it seemed as though Saul's deadline was up and he just wrapped it up. I've heard such great things about his writing that I decided to read another of his books....Punish The Sinners.....and wouldn't you know he did it again. I don't know if this is his sytle of writing or I just happened to pick the wrong books but they've sworn me off his writing for good.
4,Truly Frightening,"My first JS book was Punish the Sinners. It was a huge disappointment. I'm glad I took a chance and read this book. The plot is a bit confusing at times, but the fear factor more than makes up for it.It has been a long time since I have actually been scared while reading a book (The Shining, Salem's Lot), but this book gave me chills at times. The pure evil of the young girl, and the hopeless determination of her younger sister make this book a must read."
2,A legend without an explanation.,"I'm a fan of Saul, and I'm glad that I didn't read his first novel, until now. If I had, I might not have bothered to read any of his others. Suffer the Children is not a good book. The book's storyline centers around a legend about an old woman who slept and dreamed for two days and two nights. Her dreams told her who was going to die and how including deaths involved with a mysterious cave. Saul never really expands on the legend to help the reader to understand why the evil has returned to Port Arbello. He throws into the mix a Ouija Board and a portrait of a little girl, but once again, doesn't bother to connect it all up. My advice, try one of Saul's later books. Their much better."
2,100 years ago. . .,"100 years ago there was a very talented writer who couldn't sell his work to save his life. He died penniless in a seedy garret. His last words were, ""I shall return!' Fast-forward 100 years. Now, as then, there is writer, but this writer is very untalented. However, his work sells like hotcakes and makes him a lot of money. This bad writer is the reincarnation of the first one I described. But now he know what sells to an undemanding readership, so he uses the same plotline in every novel he writes: an unavenged century-old death, a young person who starts acting irrationally, animal deaths, etc. I guess he can't help it."
5,THIS BOOK IS THE ULTIMATE IN HORROR!!!,"When I was in middle school, I first read ""Suffer The Children"" and it was,no doubt, what got me hooked on the John Saul Fan that I am to this day. That book terrified, anticipated, made me wish there were more of it's kind. He has become a regular part of his world and I am so looking forward to the new June release of the next scary novel!!! John, YOU ARE THE MAN OF SUSPENSE!!!!Lenore@ Fmansearay"
2,Not One Of His Best,"I read the review before I bought this book and I thought I would enjoy it but I didn't.Saul tackles the controversial subject of child molestation in this one then branches off into a macabre story about a possessed/reincarnated? young girl that does horrible things to to other children.I was very confused by this book but I gave it the benefit of the doubt right up until the very disappointing end. My final word on this is, the book has plot holes so wide you could hide mack trucks in them.I couldn't identify with the characters either and I think that's an important element of any story.Saul I think you ran out of steam one quarter of the way into the book and rushed it off to meet your deadline. Don't do it again!"
3,Good book but Kindle version is full of errors,"I read this book as a teen when it first came out and loved it. Now that I'm an adult, it's good but not as great as I remember it. I must say though, the Kindle version is full of sentences without periods and some of the worst typos I have ever seen. I am shocked that this book could have made it to ""print"" this way. I was happy to see that John Saul's back catalog was finally coming to Kindle, but if they all have typos like Suffer the Children does, I may not read another."
2,Not Algorithmic Data Mining,"SAS is not the best system for data mining to begin with. R (or S-plus) seems to provide a much stronger framework and packages for Classification and Regression Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks etc. SAS cannot really do any of these with the base system.All of the techniques covered in this book are fairly standard statistical techniques that don't really match with what I consider data mining to be (i.e. regression, principal component analysis, discrimination analysis). There are better texts for these techniques that cover both the theory and code more indepth."
1,"Died, in spite of best efforts","I bought this from Amazon (not the seller depicted currently). The plant looked great on arrival, but it died with 15 days, despite trying very hard and following all instructions. I wonder if shipping in a box (and depriving light, etc for 2-4 days) causes such damage."
2,Really?,"Yes it came packed very nicely like the other reviews say, it even got here earlier than I expected.What I was upset about is really how ugly this tree is. I wasn't expecting something as perfectly manicured as what is shown in the picture but I definitely wasn't expecting the Hackjob that arrived on my doorstep. It looked like it someone had just lopped off about a foot in order for it to fit in the box... I just got it an hour ago and I'm seriously debating returning it because I don't know if I have it in my to make this look like anything other than a diseased, half-dead stick with some leaves glued on.The trunk is very straight which is nice, and even with the free shipping it still arrived with moist soil. The pot is also very nice. The reason for a 2 star instead of a 1 or less."
1,"misleading, inaccurate, poor choice for sympathy gift","Picture a straight stick, lopped off at the top, with a few bare branches a few tiny bits of green, and you have this ""bonsai"" plant. Very well packed, but pathetic when unpacked, the only resemblance to the photos on the Amazon page would be the pot, which is identical. We received this as sympathy gift after death in family. Hard to imagine a more absurd item. Noted this to the sender, who apparently complained and got a second sent, very similar to the first. Deceptive photo, this item needs a strong disclaimer against use as a gift."
1,Mine was dead.,"The tree was well packaged and came quickly, but was dead. I would have liked some written instructions about the tree rather than a recommendation to call the seller. I was also not sure whether the tree was dormant and was perhaps supposed to look the way it does (in December.) I'm still hoping it may revive, so I'm hanging on to it. It was intended as a gift to celebrate a marriage, but I couldn't give a dead looking tree in that circumstance."
5,Perfect,I got this tree in the Winter time and it was in great condition. All of the needles fell off almost immediately but they've all grown back now that it's spring. The pot is real ceramic and it was fully covered with moss over the soil. I've seen the pot alone for $30 so this was a pretty good value.
1,ugly!!,The tree is very ugly... was not cut in away to look like a little tree.. the tree is huge which is nice but has a very very ugly top.. looks like some one potted a bush.. Cheap to buy but nothing like a bonsai. Looks like my 4 year old made this. Sad this was a present. :(
3,It's ok,"The first tree I got, it wasn't looking like a tree, more like a branch. I contacted the seller, and ask to send me similar to the one from the amazon picture, is it so difficult?! New tree arrived few days ago, much large, older, but it looks like they chapped off the top of the tree just to fit in the box, nice tree trunk and the pot,but the top of the tree is a total disaster.So,if you decide to buy it from this seller,make sure you state exactly what you want. Seller responds very quickly and quite care for the customers and business."
1,worst amazon experience ever!,"I recieved this product from lou's bonsai and it was such a disapointment. First off when opening the box the pot was in pieces. I can understand that this happens, but the plant was in horrible condition. It looked like nothing in the picture. I understand that this was not the same tree but it was apparent that the grower just lopped off the top of the tree and grew it like a plant. It looks horrible. My roommate was against me displaying it in our living room because of the crappy look it has. I was so disapointed I am an avid collector of bonsai trees and it will take years for this bush to look like a tree again. I contacted lou who told me he was going to reship but that never happened. DO NOT BUY FROM LOU'S BONSAI. They totally ruined everything about this transaction"
1,Nice looking tree but it didn't live long,The tree was well packaged and came watered. I will say it was younger then what the picture showed.*updatI unpacked it and put in indirect sunlight and watered as suggested. All was going well but three weeks later it was dead.Tree traveled from across the country and I am not sure how long it was in the box as it was a gift. But I will say I am not sure this was a factor.Amazon wise I have one good tree still going and one dead tree......*update*Well now. I didn't dispose of the tree and found a new limb sprout. Will update as I try to recover this tree.
2,"Cracked, but Working","The tree itself wasn't as pictured, and the pot it arrived in was cracked. The company is working with us, but it's a slow process."
1,dead tree,"just like the review that i had read, came with the base wrapped securely, but that wont make up for the top being chopped off or the fact that almost all the branches were dead & the one leaf on it fell off before I could set it on my table. I am so disappointed. I dont know who to contact about this scrawny little tree"
2,Bonzai arrived looking terrible,"This bonzai arrived without a single needle on it, with an atrocious pruning job. I am definitely returning this tree."
5,BONSAI OBSESSION,THIS PRODUCT ARRIVE VERY QUICKLY AND WELL PACKED. THEY DID A OUTSTANDING JOB. RECEIVED 2 DAYS AFTER PURCHASING. TREE ARRIVED STILL MOIST AND VERY GREEN. WAS SOME LIGHT COLOR ON SOME OF THE LEAVES BUT THAT IS EXPECTED FROM THE STRESS OF SHIPPING. PLACED IN SHADE FOR A FEW DAYS AND GAVE IT A GOOD MIST EVERY DAY ON THE LEAVE AND KEPT OUT OF DIRECT SUN LIGHT AND ALL LEAVES HAVE GAINED FULL COLOR AGAIN. ANOTHER THING IS IT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN A WHILE SINCE LAST PRUNE JOB. SO I WAS ABLE TO PRUNE TO MY LIKING. ALSO THE POT IS AWESOME. I FEEL LIKE I BOUGHT A NICE POT AND GOT A TREE FOR FREE. RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE! JUST MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE ARRIVAL INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PRODUCT PAGE ON AMAZON UNDER SHIPPING NO INSTRUCTIONS COME WITH THE TREE IN THE PACKAGE EVERYTHING IS ON THE SAME PAGE AS THE PRODUCT RIGHT BELOW IT. HOPE THIS HELPS SOME ONE OUT.
2,maybe too early,not sure what to say just yet .the tree wasn't what i had expected it looked like they put a stick in the pot hacked it a little and sent it on its way . after 4 days the leaves all turned brown and limp . i am hopeing it is just a phase but i will wait it out and see. i have ordered many trees on amazon and all were great i just hope this one turns aroun
4,Hip 60s soundtrack tunes,"Easy Tempo has done it again with another great compilation! Lots of great stuff here, loaded with Hammond B3, Electric & Fuzz Guitars, jazzy brass sections & wordless vocals. The recordings are nice and clear and clean. Very enjoyable, great for parties."
2,Pretty Worthless - Very Disappointed,"These are very small, only 3-1/2 X 8 inches, and do not stay cold. Before buying, I checked several sites for the size, but nothing was listed anywhere (that should have been my clue). I need these for headaches and the back of my neck. Because they are so small, they do not stay cold, maybe 5 minutes on either side. I haven't used them warm, but I imagine the same would be true. I ordered 2, and by the time they added tax and shipping it was $38 for basically 2 worthless little beanbags. I bought one years ago that was twice as wide as these and was filled with cloves and spices. It was the best product I've ever used. Stayed cold for approx. 45 to 50 minutes. Have never been able to replace it with anything remotely close. But -- I'll keep trying!"
5,Beyond a flat wall,"This is a fascinating book that brings to life the evidence that is not only clear but fairly undeniable. One only has to look at the prophecy in Ezekial 38 and 39 to see that God certainly uses the ""weather"" to shake things up and put an end to anti-semitic/anti-Israeli behavior. It is very easy for a third or fourth party to say to someone 'give your land up to your certain enemy', especially when the third party has no vested interest. The blessed hope in the Faith and in this book is that one doesn't have to be a certain type of scholar to comprehend basic truth. They must simply look beyond a flat wall and see a vision of detailed structure. This book makes that very easy to accomplish."
5,Awesome book for bible-believing christian and jewish zionists,"Excellent book showing God's warnings to America regarding our treatment of Israel. Please read if you love the U.S., Israel, and the city of Jerusalem. The author also has an excellent news site [...]for those interested. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem."
4,Great summary,"Mr. Koenig puts everything down to minute detail. Too bad we don't have enough ""believers"" to see our country act accordingly."
1,serious allegations need serious support,"This book is very detailed (though not endnoted very clearly). In fact, I suspect the author may have been paid by the word...Unfortunately, it is not very cohesive. He makes a good case that bad things happen in the world, and that Israel negotiates often with US involvement, but I do not think he ties the two together into any sort of causal relationship, which is what the book promises. Just because two phenomena occur does not mean they are related to each other. I was hoping it could clearly make such an argument, and wanted him to succeed, since I know people who recommended this book. But he failed for me."
1,Poor description of product,"Description didn't state the edition. It is an older version of this book, missing important recent events and updates."
1,More of the Same,"There appears to be a culture in some religious circles that is so focused on being right and supporting tacitly held beliefs by any means necessary, that honest self-critique is impossible. For me, this book is symbolic of this phenomenon.The logic behind this book is no different than that of reading tarrot cards or one's astrological sign. It's a way to figure out that something is what you want it to be.Read a book on the historical perspective on Christian Zionism and Pre-millennial dispensationalism before digging into this kind of thought.A readable alternative if you're intersted in End-time events or the connections of world events with religion, try ""Rapture, Revelation, and the End Times"" By Forbes and Kilde."
5,Pretty Pleased,Eye to Eye is an eye opener. Israel deserves better treatment from all. That says everything in a nut shell.
4,EYE TO EYE,"I have not begun to read this book. I received two others in the same time period. However, the sub-title Facing The Consequences of DIVIDING ISRAEL. This title and the material in this book has historical, current and prophetic signifance as found in such Old Testament Passages of the Old Testament, i.e. the book of Zechariah especially chapters 12 and following.I want to thank you for carrying such books which are of great importance for the believer, the seeker and the unbeliever who is willing to explore some Eternal Truths.Thanks for this opportunity,Harold E. Grubbs"
5,Eye to Eye: Facing the Consequences of Dividing Israel,"I love this book. I saw it advertised on TV to order through the program, and I looked at several book stores and they didn't carry it. I ordered it through Amazon cheaper than through the program. It is an awesome book!!! Very informative, a real eye opener."
3,For the disciplined reader,"""Eye to Eye"" was a challenge to continue reading; its primarily a list of facts and associations, and while I agree w/ the theology and the associations, its still a little on ""the dry side."""
5,LONG LOST GOLDEN ERA CLASSIC!,"I NEVER HEARD OF THESE GUYS BEFORE UNTIL I LISTENED TO THE SAMPLES OF THIS ALBUM. I WAS AMAZED AND BLOWN AWAY. THESE GUYS WOULD OF BEEN RIGHT UP THERE WITH SOME OF THE ILLEST GROUPS OF THE ""HIPHOP GOLDEN ERA"" IF THIS ALBUM WAS COMMERICALLY RELEASED WHEN IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE. HAS THAT CLASSIC GOLDEN ERA SOUND ON EVERY BEAT. IM GLAD THEY FINALLY DECIDED TO RE-RELEASE IT THIS YEAR. FANS OF MASTA ACE, LITTLE BROTHER AND JERU DA DAMAJA WITH PRIMO ALBUMS WILL LOVE THIS JOINT. IF U MISS HEARING CLASSIC HIPHOP ALBUMS WHERE EVERY BEAT WAS DOPE THOUGHOUT THE WHOLE ALBUM, THEN THIS ONE IS A MUST BUY FOR YOUR HIPHOP COLLECTION. I ALREADY GOT MY COPY, GET YOURS BEFORE IT SELLOUTS."
3,Like it but too much filler,This CD has the Delfonics' hits on it but there's a lot of songs I didn't recognize in between them. Otherwise a good collection and I'm glad I got it.
5,Music,It was exactly what I expected and the quailty of the music on the cd is excellent. I am extremely satisfied with the product.
4,Album rating,I'm very pleased with my La La Means I Love You: Definitive Collection of the Delfonics CD...voices from the past!
4,La La Means Great Music Inside,"Delfonics fans-take a listen. Every track is here, excellent recordings, and still the lush group blend that takes you there and back. It's a smooth ride!"
4,Soul Heaven,"A great soul album. I missed out on the Delfonics in the 70's, but was alerted to what they were by the Quentin Tarantino film ""Jackie Brown"". Great songs, performed with true conviction and musicality."
5,best R&B group before the Stylistics,A very excellent group with very excellent songs indeed. The release of this cd was a great opportunity for a Delfonics' fan like me to acquire this jewel treasure of songs.A very nice cd for your collection.
4,Almost perfect...,"Nobody loves the harmonies, melodies and memories that these guys evoke like me...BUT, there is one glaring ommision...'I Gave to You', the Ultimate Slow Jam when I was in Jr. High School, yeah, knit just out of the cleaners, BRUT, 'Fro picked out to the max and that blue light in the basement at Felicia's house (she gave the BEST house parties). That Philly sound is timeless and priceless..."
5,Another Better than 5 stars,"Harmony, lyrics, singing, singing, singing, soulful, will make you think you can walk right up to the sun. Heck if I know what the young people are singing today, only it ain't about love. The Delfonics are right up there with Smokey in their hey day, only Smokey could make you really shiver!!! And he didn't sing nasty lyrics the way they do today. What's up with that? Can't they sing a song any more without getting nasty with it? Buy this cd, put it on for your baby and you will know what to do at the end, and if you don't I can't help you. Excellent."
1,"Shoe might be great, but Amazon and Shoemall cancelled my order!","There was a super-discounted price listed so I ordered two pairs of this shoe in different colors and a day later, Amazon cancelled my order. These might be great shoes, but I'll never know because I can't get them!"
1,Size Problem,Allen Edmonds Men's Conway Slip-onThe product was offered with free shipping. I ordered my usual size 11D and this came much larger than other brands and did not fit. I had to pay for the shipping in order to return the item and therefore did not order a size smaller as I lost my free shipping.
3,Good movie,Good movie. Once again the Chinese show the side of war that most movies do not like - senseless and futile.
4,Im a sucker for battles with massive human armies...,"This one is set in China in the old days where you had massive armies invadingor getting invaded. I was not dissapointed. But dont look for a Hollywood typeof storyline where all ends well ...bottom line..you know what will happen at theend before the end of the movie. This one keep you guessing. It takes in consideration not just the hero ..but the others..the good and the bad and howthe individual influences the storyline.Anyway i like it...like the ending...like the action...and because of that idid'nt mind reading the subtitles.I do recommend this to others that like this genre.Good action, costumes...pretty good acting and great scenery.enjoy."
4,Nice surprise,"I am not a fan of Asian movies, but I cannot do other than recommend this one to any one looking for a smart script, good acting, excellent scenery, action, and profound dialogs as well. This movie will refresh those tired of totally dull and totally superficial war stories that based their script on individual soldier histories that are somehow obligated to fight because they had nothing else productive to do somewhere else in the first place. Instead, you will see how straight and fair war morality collides against politics and selfishness. While you will not have tons of blood for nowadays war movie standards, war brutality is depicted to a good extent, so you will miss the blood shower. Good to excellent DVD transfer, English and Spanish subtitles provided, widescreen presentation."
4,measurements,"Great towel rack for the bath. We had to cut it down to fit where needed. Their measurements were off as stated in the item info. I just didn't read it until rack was delivered. Again, not a big enough deal to return it!"
4,a really useful one,This book is the best choice if you need to initiate in the use of java crypto API (as its title claims) and it informs extensively about Bouncy Castle crypto API (which I also recommend).Definitely a good book.
5,Very Helpful and Up To Date,"If you are just beginning Java this may be a little over your head. However, the concepts and sample applications are all relatively simple. The first chapter provides an excellent overview of why and how the Java crypto architecture works.I do not regularly keep up with crypto news so some of the tips in this book have been helpful such as not to use SHA1 anymore. It it helpful when the book goes into potential attacks on code as well in order to provide the reader with ideas of the best approach to building secure architectures.Prior to purchasing this book I had been trying to use several different online examples that did not go into enough depth. I would be willing to recommend this book to anyone trying to do crypto in Java."
3,Not enough Detail,"This text has a lot of code snippets. If you like copying code into an IDE, compiling and running with litle understanding of what the code is doing, this book is for you. This is an old book 2005 so the author had a superficial unnderstanding of cryptography when he wrote it. Terms just mysteriously appear with no lead in. Consider a newer and more comprehensive text."
3,Avoid this book if you are looking for details,"Before reading this book, I had in-depth understanding of cryptography.Based on my knowledge:PROS:-- Covers nearly all the aspects of Java Cryptography.-- Good for code snippetsCONS:-- Lousy or lack of explanation given. This is a major drawback I feel, because the main point is missing. If you dont care about the underlining working, go for this book, otherwise avoid this book"
3,not what i expected,i read some of the comments and they said things like heavy realistic. i bought this on impulse because how cheap the price was. its so (plastic) not abs but just plastic. it shouts pretty good fps(feet per second) is about 175. i don't like how you cant buy another battery at a higher volt for it because its special adapter. the scope doesn't work its to bright and you cant see through it. but the gun over all is great for the money. but one thing it said 3-5 day shipping it took about 12 that's it
4,Good Customer Service.,"Product arrived on schedule. However the gun's nozzle was broken when it arrived, and I called up the customer service center and they were fast and polite to respond by resending another package. The second packagearrived on its scheduled time and was in perfect condition.The red dot sights are like what most users had said and that it is too bright too see anything. But it's not a major problem. So far the gun does not have any major problems, but what could you expect for a $30 airsoft. haha.overall the product is good. Just don't have high expectations and you'll be fine."
4,Great gun for the money,Battery has a very long life. All accessories are as described by the seller. Only problem is based on the type of BB's used the gun may jam in full auto.
4,Good buy for good fun,"I'm a 16 year old guy and I like to shoot stuff. Given this, I took very well to airsoft games with my friends and neighbors. When we started we were all green to the game and 6 years later we're almost pros. having said that I'd like to add that this gun is excellent for beginner to intermediate players, it's a good addition to any size arsenal as both a primary and secondary weapon. My only complaint is with whoever put mine together, they left out the speed loader for the low-cap mag...sad, yet not crippling, the high cap mag is better anyway."
2,cyma mp5,"Watever you do do not get this gun if you are gonna do some backyard airsoft war. It is not recommended for outdoor. the BB curves up as soon as it hits the outside, i don't know why i got it i guess i was young, but avoid this gun. The sight's crosshair is way off, the mock scilencer is loose, the stock is about to break. The high cap. is actually pretty good. I've had this gun for about a year now, it jammed once. I would suggest going to hitguns.com, or speedytoys.com, hobbytron.com, airsplat.com . they have good guns there, but i found this gun in those sites too."
3,The mag release is bad.,"I was at my freinds house and it was hilarios he just got this gun and the mag release button broke off so now he cant get the mag out, but any way dont buy this gun the mag realese can easily break off becuse its just a bent peice of plastic then you push forward, for the mag to drop out."
1,Dont Buy Bad Gun,I bought this gun and i was dissipounted in it it sucked i wish i would have spent mu money on a real gun so i could kill myself insted of buying this piece of crap.It broke instantlly out of the box and its fps is like 150 not 200 and the low cap magizene runs out in secongs and the 110 round clip also blows so terrible gun over all DONT BUY PLEASE ITS IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,sucks,"This gun fired one clip of 20 rounds and did not fire another shot. This gun is not worth the money, spend a little more and go to a store or buy from a good site."
4,Pretty nice gun,"Warnings not in the manual: Be Very careful pretty fragile Solution: The gun strap. Do not put the mag in backwards! Solution: Get someone strong to help pull it out. Figure out how to use and adjust the hop well! Solution: Read the instructions and get a good sense of it.Cons: Weak scope, Weak silencer but its still good for the gun, keep it one it gives the gun a longer barrel so the bb will go straighter. The small mag dose not hold many bb's.Pros: Looks cool, Can shoot good once the hop is figured out. Big mag works good. Nice and hefty, just enough weight for the gun to feel good. Good strap and the speed loader works well.Pros and Cons: The small mag can be used and a gun itself just not many bb's.Overall good gun, for beginners you need to read up on it a lot."
5,Wow....,"When I first got this gun i thought it would be bad because my parents bought it, but then on the battlefield it pwnd about everyone. When I was shooting, everyone would be backing up. Very good accuracy and fps. All the other guns that i've had always flew to the ground or jumped before it hit the target, but this has the hop switch thing. 5/5"
4,this gun is good with other companys.,"this particular gun is not to good, but there is a relativly cheap marui version that is way better. it has a hi fps, which is above 300 btw, for all you researchers. the mag holds about 25 rounds, and it is not very hard to hand load. the marui version shoots incredibly far. i have a lake house, which has a cove that is about 350 feet across. it unbeleivably shoots all the way across , and still hurts when hit. i am not saying this brand isnt good, but this marui is not to expensive, and it is a lot beter. btw this is not suzie, its her 14 year old son."
4,Broken Battery,"This gun looks alright and weight basically nothing, only downside is that i recieved a broken battery so i just got to stare at it. had to shell out another $16 for a new battery, and i haven't got that yet."
3,"Gun looks cool :D,to bad both clips don't work -_-","So I finally get the gun ,only to find out neither of the clips work >:/ and I just took them out the box wtf ."
5,perfect submachine gun,"shoots great. no jam. 110 bbs in a clip. stings like a b*tch when you got shoot.the gun is all plastic and it feels lik it can snap easy, but i take care of my stuff so it hasnt broke."
2,this gun sucks,"it is weak, and too short of the clip. the boxy mag doesnt work. it takes forever to turn."
2,dont get your hopes too high,"well ok i got this gun with kida low hopes but still i wanted it to be cool and of course i take it out and it looks great and i kind of put it together and am messing around and the battery takes that first 12 hours. so the next day im all excided and i bring it out side and it shoots THREE times and stops and it dosent shoot anymore, if anyone mabe knows why... or if theres something that will make it shoot i would be extreamly thankfull"
2,what you need to know,"Ok, this is gonna be short.But this is a decent SMG, well, it's slightly underpowered, not a great idea if you're playing with serious airsofters with AEGs.Construction wise it's durable. except the selector switch doesn't seem to like going full-auto anymore.Ammunition wise it sometimes can jam.That's all"
3,ya its ok,"its ok it really only shoots about 120 fps, it would be cooler if it was not as heavy. the only thin good for the gun is to have a more powerful m4 and have this on your back for close range shooting to conserve amo on your other gun"
4,Great gun for close range and beginners.,"I just got this gun today and it works great. The seller is very reliable and shipped in a timely manner. I ordered this gun late night on March 18th and got it on March 23rd, keep in mind there was two weekend days when it was not in transit and took only 4 business days to ship. Now to the pros and cons.Pros-Has A Very Sturdy Feel In Your HandsGreat For Low Powered AEGNice Adjustable StockStock Has A Nice Rubber PadSelectable Rate Of Fire (Safe, Semi-Auto, Full-Auto)Cons-Plastic Gear BoxSlightly Hard To Put In And Take Out Magazines (Might Be Because Its Brand New)Short Sling (Just To Small For Me)Crappy Electronic SightSometimes Wont Fire (Might Be Caused By A Low Battery)Most of the Cons are fixable just by buying your own items. I would highly recommended this gun for anyone who wants a entry level AEG. Feel free to comment on this review for more info that I will gladly provide when I get to check out this gun"
2,needs better parts,after i shot this gun once today the mag release broke off and now i cant take the mag out of my gun and the scope wore out super fast so now no light goes out of it it was a fun gun but needs better parts
2,This gun is ok,The gun didn't even come with all the parts.This gun is ok and is cheap and it jams were you put the clip in and its impossible to get the fricken clip in. Its not powerful at all it doesn't even go through cardboard. It hurts my brother but he's a big fat wimp. Other than him it doesn't hurt anyone. its ok for starters but you start to want more power. Hope this was helpful.
3,Battery Burn Out,"As others have spoken about, the battery gets warm then hot if left plugged into the charger for more than an hour or two. Checking the chargers voltage you can see why, it reads 14 volts while the battery is only 7.2 volts. The manufacturer is destroying your battery by doing this. Over heating NiCad battery brings an early death. It turn you can do what I did. Find an universal charger (I had a junk one) that has an output of no more than 9 volts and no less than 7.2. Then cut the ends off both chargers and splice the guns connector to the new chargers cable keeping in mind the polarity (black wire with white stripe on the guns connector is positive +). I can know charge without overheating. As for the gun it is what most people say it is. For the price it an O.K. back yard shooter. My boys are happy."
2,Not a good gun,"The reason I rated these product that way was because at first, when I bought it, it was seemed to be a googd gun that has a rapid fire in the Automatic mode, had a good range, and it had a strong damage for it to be a cheap gun. Once, I was shooting in automatic normally(this happened 3 weeks after I bought the gun).Later, when I was running out of ammo, I don't know how, the trigger of the gun went out flying but that wasn't the problem because if it would, I would just need to open the gun and put the trigger in it's place. THE REAL PROBLEM WAS THAT ONE STRANGE PIECE OF THE GUN GOT DAMAGED AND I COULN'T FIND THE PIECE ANYWHERE IN THE INTERNET SO, AT LAST, I SOLD THE GUN IN EBAY."
3,Great Starter - Quality not excellent,"I think this is a great starter-weapon for your youngster who wants to get into air-soft. The quality of the product is not great. I ordered three of them and had the following various issues:-threaded barrel snapped off one while my son was screwing on the orange time-hop-up on one gun is unable to be turned off.Accuracy is suspect, but for $30, I didn't expect much. They shoot fast enough, and my 12-year old son is very excited to start shooting me."
3,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY THE GUN!,When i first got this gun it worked fine it shot every time and was easy to reload.But about 3 days later the black cord on the battery broke making the battery useless.The sights on the gun are pretty nice but a bit sensitive.The mag is pretty small so you might want to by extra mags.Its a nice gun for the price but don.t expect it to last over 2 years.For a good gun that lasts a very long time (over 2 years) get the Pulse R76.
3,Marui my ass,"Saying a gun is a Marui doesn't make it one. I've frequently shot the marui and I own this, and i can honestly say this is no marui. I don't know why they need the long NYPD fully auto blah blah blah title, this is called the CYMA MP5J and is sold on shortyusa as that name if you want better service and more info. This gun shoots about 120-130 FPS and about 60 feet. For more clarification, i can barely hit the house across the streeet from me. The capacity is all right, and accuracy is ok. IT shoots 550 rounds per minute.PROS:1) cheap2) good capacity3) looks coolCONS:1) low FPS2) not too accurate3) accessories are garbage4) plastic gears strip easilyOverall its about 6/10. If you like MP5's and don't have a lot of money to spend, get this. Otherwise get the CSI MP5SD5 from shortyusa.com2) not too accurate"
1,Defective Product - Do Not Purchase,"This gun has a defective magazine and Sellers cannot find you a magazine that works when you notify them of your issue. I actually had a Seller who offered to try out magazines so that they could ship me one that works and they couldn't find one that wasn't defective. Without the magazine, the gun can't be used. Don't purchase this product."
2,Not so good gun,"Gun jams too easily, cannot fix it. The sight is a 1/2"" off and you cannot adjust it. Silencer does not silence. Liked the size of the double mag, and the weight and design of the gun."
2,nice looks but crapy guts!!!!!,First off I like the looks but the inside guts suck! the shipping was realy fast but the first time I used it it worked for about 15 muinites than some thing went weird I was shooting it in semi-auto and it suddenly went into full-auto and didnt fire anything. basicly if you want a sturdy gun DONT BUY THIS GUN!!
4,GOOD GUN,"This is a good gun . First, when you look at the gun when your finished building it looks amazing. Next, the fax scope really helps . It also comes with two mags that is a real time saver . The reason I did not give this gun 5 stars is the first time I got it it was broken. If you buy this gun and it is broken please send it back. There is no argument if the gun is broken. They will just send you another one."
5,Amazing,"my friend has this and it is amazing, he put a 9 volt battery and it shoots like 450 FPS. Most of my friends use 500 FPS guns and 780 FPS sniper rifles and it still can compeet with them. I would buy a bigger mag (there is a 500 Rd magazine on amazon for $13. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Fairly worthless,"I FIND THIS FAIRLY WORTHLESS. THE MANUAL IS WRITTEN IN CHINA BY ENGLISH CHALLENGED PERSONS. THEY HAD TO ADD SOME CHINESE WRITTEN WARNINGS ON THE TOP OF THE BOX IT CAME IN. THE SCOPE IS DESIGNED TO FALL OFF, WHICH IS OKAY, SINCE IT HAS NO FUNCTION. JAMS OR MALFUNCTIONS CONSTANTLY. THE SPEEDLOADER (COMPLETELY INCORRECTLY DEPICTED IN THE ""MANUAL""), DOES NOT WORK WORTH A DARN. UNRELIABLE."
2,Save your money,"This airsoft gun is what is known as an LPEG, or Low Powered Electric Gun. Let me tell you, they were not kidding when they named it that. I actually used a chronograph to rate this gun at 60 feet per second. It is hard to feel shots from this gun at a distance of 10 feet.It was fun to mess around with, but I would recommend saving your money. A UTG Multishot Shotgun can be had for around 60 dollars, and it fires 3 rounds per pump at over 300 feet per second. Also try to get your hands on the Cyma Glock 18c AEP (Automatic Electric Pistol.) I have seen those for 50 dollars."
4,Fatigue Artist No Sweat to Read about,"I had never heard of Lynne Sharon Schwartz, but was sufficiently attracted by the title (reminiscent of Kafka's ""Hunger Artists"") to order the book from a remainder catalogue. It was a pleasant surprise -- not grim. not self-pitying, but lightly satirical and self-mocking, with a hard core of genuine sentiment. The narrator, in other words, is good company. I don't think this method of writing a novel -- lengthy, apparently purposeless diary-type entries -- is to be recommended, but Schwartz is such a skilled and elegant writer that she held my attention to the end. Verdict: very much worth reading, if you want something more than ordinary narrative fiction, though (speaking as a professional editor) I would have cut her text by about twenty percent and dumped the photos). And yes: I shall be reading more of her work."
4,The Skill of Intimacy,"I was introduced to Schwartz with ""Disturbances in the Field,"" which remains one of my favorites of all-time. She has a knack for creating intimacy; you're sitting in a friend's kitchen, talking over long cups of coffee. Lest that sound smarmy or banal-chummy, I hasten to add she is also an intelligent author. But it is her mastery of voice which draws you in so closely to the characters she creates, and you walk away convinced this is not fiction but some version of real life, told by a masterful storyteller."
5,So sweet you could cry,"There's so much sweet chimurenga-style guitar here tears of bliss could flow. Jonah Sithole shows here why he's the best guitarist of that style. So much melodic expression. The mellow vocals and singular yet crystal clear mbira provide nice backing. It's hard to pick out any standouts here, they'd all qualify, but tracks 2 through 6 I could play forever and not notice. The jit style is also showcased in the latter tracks. Chakafukudza Dzimba stands out for the guitar-work. Checkout the switch to Congo style guitar midway through. And Ereniya is classic Zim pop - tearjerk lyrics over lovely string melody and a driving rhythm. A must for any collection of Zimbabwean music, a classic of the roots styles. RIP Jonah."
3,comprehensive review of this most violent of organisations,The author has produced a comprehensive insight into one of the most violent paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland. He takes the reader through the many splits in the organisation and explains the twisted reasoning behind some of this group's most bloody deeds. A must for anybody interested in the history of the troubles in Ulster.
5,"Well, if ""Irish"" Americans hate it, it must be good!","I see the ""reader from texas"" didn't like this. Well, anyone who defends terrorism from the quaint seclusion of america, as opposed to my experience of every day life in orthern Ireland is entitled to their view... but they are talking through their rear end!I'm a history tecaher in Northern Ireland. Let me tell you this is an excellent study of a tawdry little band of thugs and murderers. t exposes to a tee the sort of lowlife scum they were, and details their many divisions and feuds when thankfully they exterminated each other.Come and live here, ""reader from Texas""! Come and see the pain these miserable cowards caused!"
4,Electronica DUB from YOUTH,"After settling into this lucid landscape of deep, theraputic bass and treated mindscapes into some real nice sound, I let myself really fall into Dub Trees' beauty. If you're a fan of the great 'Orblivion' from the Orb, then you'll understand this. YOUTH's compositions are truly mind delving. Imagine digging yourself out of a hole in the ground and appearing in the middle of nowhere with two GIANT speakers there to tell you their message. (like the sleeve illustrates)"
5,Nostalgic,"Anyone who hit the clubs in the early/mid eighties will want this album. It's great party music, and excellent driving music."
4,dancing with myself,"it seems that i have concentrated on the 6o'sand 70's in my cd collection. there was notmuch from the 80's decade except for talking heads,clash,pearl jam etc. this collection fills thathole quite nicely. it starts out with the romanticsand billy idol i forgot how much these two bandsrocked. you will also get flock seagulls, abc,duran duran alot of british new wave. the cutby the fine young cannibals 'you drive me crazy'is quite catchy & will remind you of why youliked it even if its been 10 years since you lastheard it. recommended"
3,Fine and dandy CD but mixing is a pain,"This is as almost as good a new wave hits cd as you're going to get... though ignoring two of the greatest artists, Tears for Fears and Devo, is a grave misstep. The segue between each tracks is, in my opinion, annoying and unneccesary. It makes ""Random"" mode and ripped mp3s sound stupid."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,[...] did NOT deliver this item. They did a BAIT-AND-SWITCH and sent another item that is NOT time release. This is probably the best that store can do. They also make it VERY VERY HARD to return anything. Clearly they want to punish people who want to return items they did not order.
4,Jurassic Park & other themes,I loved Jurassic Park and other themes except for the fact that there was a defect in the recording of the Jurassic Park theme.
2,The CD cover is worth a chuckle...,"I bought this for $1 in Downtown Manhattan (not that location's all that important, I just felt like typing Manhattan-- oh, there I go again!) just because the cover looks so hokey and 3rd-party... I just had to get it! Not surprisingly, several of the tracks on here sound synthesized, as if someone performed a whole orchestra on an electronic piano. But, I need to give it credit-- for the most part, MOST of the tracks are actually played by a symphonic orchestra. There's even a literal *LIVE* track thrown in somewhere near the end of the album, complete with a real clapping audience! (I haven't listened to it in a while, but seeing this album actually get reviews pushed me to write one myself!)So, yes. The album pretty much sounds as it looks. It's an identity-confused mix of synthesized, studio-recorded, and live tracks. But if you can get it at a clearance store for $1, that's worth it... just for the fake ""Jurassic Park"" logo & dinosaur on the cover!!!"
4,Great Read,"Wow...what a story. This book made my blood boil. Excellent read, bit heavy on the detail and it is challenging to keep up with all the players. Even so, highly recommend it."
4,Den of Thieves,"Transaction good. Book in good enough conditionn for a gift. Based on previous transactions, will be very cautious when ordering books online."
5,Excelent reading for those interested in investment Banking,"This book was really well writen and covers the breadth of what goes on in the investment banking world. I like the introductions on how the major investment houses started, and the roles of the Investment bankers, traders, lawyers, arbitragers etc. The central figure is Michael milken, who the book suggests is greedy and foul. The book is obviously on the side of US law enforcement, who some argue were biased and sought to destroy Milken for other motives. On the whole, I think it is a great book and it really helps one understand the whole finance game, and what happens (or used to happen) in wall street. Being from an Engineering and computing background, but with interest in M&A myself, I feel this book was really cool. I however reserve my judgements on Michael Milken till I read another book that is pro Milken. Taking away the crime aspects, I think Michael Milken is a genius."
3,"Reads well, but not very objective. Needs math lesson.","First read this book in college. Reread it recently have having spent the last five years in the finance industry, several in high-yield investment banking. As a narrative, the book is a nice read, especially the first half. But to say that it's not an objective piece of work would be hyperbole. Stewart does well capturing the flavor and the sensationalism of the times but his assessment of Milken or Drexel or the high yield market, is not a sober or accuate one. And his numbers didn't always add up. (Take a calculator to those pages explaining bond commissions.) In the end, Stewart comes off as just another conspiracy theorist, before the conspiracy theories were in vogue. Still, kind of a fun read."
5,"If you enjoy the investment world, this is for you!","This was one book that I could not put down. The book is broken into large sections, each dealing with a particular criminal and his corresponding activities. In-depth descriptions of what was going on behind the scenes at some of the most respected financial firms of the time--absolutely fascinating. If you were around in the 80's, and you work/participate in the investment industry, this should be required historical reading."
2,Difficult to understand for a non investment banker,The book takes you deep into the investment banking world . If you dont know your Morgan Stanley from your Goldman Sachs then this book will make little sense to you. There is a laundry list of investment banking firms and bankers mentioned hastily throughout the book. They all just blended into one thing since I did not have any deep understanding of what these firms actually do and how they are different from each other . So I would not recommend this for the layman.
3,no stone unturned,"overly detailed account of the rise of the junk bond world. if you want an exhaustive account of the events, this is your book."
3,A cluster of information and innuendo reporting,"This book is a useful source of what happened in certain corners of Wall Street in the 80s, whith an emphasis of only the bad and ignoring some of the positive effects that the same characters had in and out of the business community and while committing - and occasionally allegedly committing - crimes.Unfortunately, there are simply too many instances where motives or instances assumed to have occured in a certain fashion are explained as fact.I recommend that people interested in this topic read Predators' Ball first."
2,Den of Thieves,"This book was very insightful about the misgivings of some powerful financial magnates. However, the writing is poor and the author rushes through parts of the story that leaves the reader with more questions than answers. It is written by a professional journalist and not a novelist, so it reads like a newspaper article, which can be highly condensed for space. I would recommend the predator's ball. It is a much better account. And if you are interested in what Micheal Milken is up to these days check out The Milken Institute. The guy is still a billionaire."
3,Heavy going investigative journalism,"I liked the first 100 pages or so of this book because it had a very engaging style when describing the circumstances and characters of the biggest insider trading scandal. However, as the book progressed, I found it more and more tedious and full of small details and names which were repeated over and over again. Apart from a few interesting and particular passages, this book is like a treatesie on the events as it develop a mammoth compendium of dates and other historical trivia. Ultimately, the book will be enjoyable for those who have a bent for long stories rather than for those who are looking for a good non-fiction story."
5,a great read,"Back in the '80s I read James Stewart's Wall Street Journal articles on the insider trading scandals. Now, in 2009, I finally picked up his book on the subject, and I found that it's every bit as fascinating, and every bit as relevant, as it was when the scandal first broke. This is the story of Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky and the other crooks who believed that ""greed is good"" and the SEC is for sissies. In the age of Madoff, mortgage-backed securities, and other financial frauds and schemes, the book is a good reminder that there's nothing new under the sun.I recommend this book for anyone interested in financial fraud. That really ought to be just about everyone."
5,Easy Money,"I read this after enjoying Stewart's later book, Disney War. This one was more thrilling as it involved real crime but still written very well as if the author was in the room. The characters include bad guys, good guys that gave in to the dark side and a few good guys that felt strong about following the law. It was the beginning of dishing out real punishment for white collar crime although one can argue they were let off easy compared to today's convictions."
4,Good read,"'Den of Thieves' was sewn together by James Stewart from numerous Wall Street Journal articles he wrote on the M&A; scandals during he 80s -- and it shows. The story is very difficult to follow, not only because the fraud was so complex, but also there were numerous players; Stewart doesn't do himself any favors by jumping around a lot. Still, it was very interesting and the second half of the book, marked by Boesky's surrender to federal agents in September 1986, is nothing short of riveting! If you enjoy Kurt Eichenwald ('Conspiracy of Fools') or Bethany McLean ('Smartest Guys in the Room') you will like 'Den of Thieves' -- although probably not as much.Next release I suggest Stewart lay out all the Drexel, Peabody, and Boesky deals in chronological order at the beginning. The cast of players at the front was helpful, but not enough for me to keep up with some of it. Enjoy!"
2,"lots of facts, little story","James Stewart has done an excellent job of gathering information about the insider-trading scandal of the 1980s, so if you're looking for all the details of these events, you'll find them in this book, which is clearly-written and well-organized. What you won't find, though, is great storytelling. Stewart is content to recount one fact after another, rarely putting them in context or using them to build narrative suspense or to reveal character. As a result--and despite the inherent drama of the events it lists--the book is a rather dull read, especially for readers who have no familiarity with the world of high finance. If you want to read a masterpiece of writing about business, try David Halberstam's ""The Reckoning."""
2,biased hatchet job,"DEN OF THIEVES is a biased hatchet job against financial genius Michael Milken--a man who was a powerful force for good in American business and is, at most, guilty of the moral equivalent of jaywalking. For more objective accounts read Daniel Fischel's PAYBACK--THE CONSPIRACY TO DESTROY MICHAEL MILKEN and Jesse Kornbluth's HIGHLY CONFIDENT."
1,Journalistic Self-Promotion---Revisited,"I read this book when it first came out in the early 90s, the summer before entering business school. At the time I thought, like many who had recommended the book, that it was a first rate piece of journalism based on sound, unbiased research.I have since learned that this book is nothing of the sort. In fact, it is a summary of one erroneous conclusion after another, based upon faulty, incorrect, hearsay 'evidence' and a wanton disregard for the truth. Moreover, I now believe that such poor authorship can mean only one thing--that Mr. Stewart was never out to reveal the truth, but instead, to make a name for himself."
1,Awful and biased,"""Den of Thieves"" is an angry get-back at Michael Milken a man who redesigned business financing and got rid of a system on Wall Sreet that was ineffective and poorly thought out. We should never accept a book written by the lover of an anti-Milken Wall Street Journal reporter as objective--it can't be. This book is a disgrace."
