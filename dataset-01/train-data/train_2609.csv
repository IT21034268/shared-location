1,12 inch 256 threaded rod,To me threaded rod means threaded the whole length of the rod. This rod is only threaded for the first one inch at one end.If Amazon want to sell this product they should describe the product in more detail
1,Non existant Warranty Repair,"The LVM-37W1 Monitor failed one year from the date of purchase. (purchased June 6, 2007 - stopped working June 9, 2008)Merchant says contact Westinghouse directly for service, Westinghouse says to go back to the merchant for service.Very poor business choices are being made here plus after the fact I have learned from reading that Westinghouse HD Monitors have issues with the power module and Westinghouse has passed the buck to everyone who has reported the same issue as I have."
1,"This is not ""The Livid""","just thought i'd let you know that this is not the band that most people have been talking about ""The Livid"" (an incredable, high energy rock band from Mississauga, ON, Canada) go to their website for more about them: www.thelivid.comI really have no idea what ""Livid Eye"" sounds like, but chances are they are not what you are looking for."
4,Great source to find your next rental,"As a fairly new Chambara/Samurai film fan, I've found this book to be a great source to help know where to look. The writing is fun and informative, definetly from a fan's point of view. It is heavy on plot details with interesting history details mixed within, but this is in no way a critical/academic book. Its much more of a fan saying ""Let me describe to you about some great films and why I found them interesting.""The book is nicely organized by time frame and one can watch the evolution of the genre. An index is in back if you prefer to track down a particular actor. There are also plenty of aside facts about actors/studios and glossary terms that I found added a nice spice to the mix.This probably won't be of much interest to the already hardcore fan, but definetly a great starting point for the novice."
3,Very brief coverage,"This short coverage of ships of the line is more like a pamphlet than a book. It does have a few nice color plates, though the centerfold of the Victory has the gunroom labeled as an anchor."
4,The Basis for all Great Management Books,"Magic of Thinking Success is the continaul look and inspiration into the mind of Dr. David Schwartz. Written over 20 years ago, the concepts and recommendations in the business community are still relevent today and form the basis of other works such as ""First Break all the Rules"". What enjoyable about all Schwartz books is the simple lessons that are explained thru real-world stories and professional insight. At the end of each chapter is a recap that allows you to pick the book up at anytime, review the lesson overview and quickly be inspired again.If you have not read any of Dr. Schwartz's books, I recommend you start with ""The Magic of Thinking Big"" and then this book or his Dreams books.You will not be disappointed with the positive words conveyed by Dr. Schwartz throughout all his works. Truly an inspiration"
5,Very satisfied,This book arrive in perfect condition. It can in a very timely matter. I am very satisfied and have no complaints.
3,"NBC, third edition is better.","I really do like New Bible Commentary (NBC) for years. It has been my favorite one volume commentary thus far. So naturally, I was excited when they decided to update (or revise) the 3rd edition of NBC to 21st century edition. But when I got it, I was little disappointed. Compare to the previous edition, it lacked the devotional and spiritual emphasis. In review:1. This NBC is more updated due to recent archaelogical findings and newer intepretations.2. NIV version of the Bible has been used as main text. This can be pro or con depending on individual's preference.3. Type-setting is actually more bothersome to the eyes than the previous edition.4. While it is updated in scholastic area, but it has lost the devotional character of the 3rd edition.I gave away my 21st century edition, because I still use the 3rd edition. Since the 3rd edition is out-of-print, you have to find it in used books. Amazon.com actually carries sellers who sell used NBC."
5,Fundamental Bible Study in one volume,"I am a Pastor and have a Master's Degree and Doctorate. For my personal study, I use this commentary and have bought it for 2 people (laypeople) for their personal study. It explains so much and yet is to the point more often than not. It is the best out there if you want just one commentary for Bible Study/Sunday School prep. Personally, it is way below what a Pastor will use for full blown Bible Study. Professors would be bored with it. But for most church people, this book should be on their shelf. If you have a High School Diploma, you should be able to understand it. Not for youth, unless they are deep or exceptional. Then, they would really benefit from it too. Just my opinion to help you, dear friend of the Bible!"
4,Very accurate,"If you are studying the Bible, this is the perfect supplement book and is a must have. Especially when reading the ""Old Testament""."
2,Wasn't What I Excepted,"I thought the book would have more about individuals but it's a very board book, so it's good for general information but not detailed."
5,Cream of the crop,"If you love jazz, jazz singers then you must own this CD. Kellye Gray is the finest jazz singer I have heard since Billie Holiday and Ella. Her gift is truly amazing. She should be on the cover of every jazz publication to let the world know of her extreme talent. Buy this one today."
4,Round Pizza Stone,"My old pizza stone gave out after 15 plus years and I wanted to try a round one since I use it almost exclusively for making pizza, not bread. Quality is fine and my only gripe is this stone is about 1/2 inch thick while my old one was closer to one inch. Will it last? Time will tell."
5,Love Love Love it!,I recieved my pizza stone last week and made multiple pizzas this weekend. The stone came securely packaged so there was no damage to the stone. My husband and guests all loved the pizza and I couldn't believe how crispy it came out. Needless to stay we won't be needing to order form our local pizzeria as much anymore!
5,Couldn't be more satisfied,"I have had this stone for at least 6 years and use it about 6 times a year. It is large, thick and heavy...as a pizza stone should be. Lately, we've been using it on our outdoor grill (BBQ), placing it in the cold grill, turning on two burners on low. After 15 minutes, turning on the third burner and bringing them all up to high. After 15 minutes the grill and stone are 500 degrees and ready to bake. When done, I turn off all the burners and leave the stone in the grill overnight to cool. Scrape off any extras with a wooden spatula and store it in the original box. No issues whatsoever."
4,"Works Great on 21"" Kettle Grill For Pizza","I bought a 14"" stone for my 21"" weber grill to make pizza and bread. It works great. I was afraid it would shatter due to the heat - which is why I bought something relatively cheap - and I was not disappointed. To make it work, I put the charcoal & wood around the perimeter of the bottom and placed the stone in the middle of the upper grate. My digital thermometer only goes up to 450F and it was maxed - I estimate the temp was over 550F (great pizza temp). I only gave it 4 stars because the first one I ordered arrived broken so I had to order another one (return process was very easy). Also - this stone is made in USA - that's important to me."
1,Stone cracked,"Very disappointed with this product. After using just two times, the stone developed a hairline crack - rendering it useless. The stone was placed on lower rack of oven and increased temperature slowly to 475 degrees. When finished, the stone would remain in the oven until it was completely cooled. I've used stones for baking pizzas, breads, etc. for over twenty years at approximately four to six times a year. My previous stones normally lasted 5 years. I mistakenly expected high quality for higher price tag. The Old Stone Oven Corporation needs to address the quality control on this product as it did not perform as advertised."
5,Better than Bialetti,"I purchased this to replace a Bialetti-brand stone from Bed Bath & Beyond. The Bialetti stone was satisfactory until it broke apart while I was gently cleaning it. While the 16-inch stone is more expensive than the Bialetti, it's worth it. For one thing, the diameter is larger. The 16-inch stone has a higher density and is heavier, which lets it store more heat, contributing to a crispier crust."
1,Beware,"My pizza stone arrived very well packed and in perfect condition. However, what I did not realize about this product is that this is a stone designed to remain in the oven ALWAYS. You have to buy a separate wooden, handled paddle-type thing on which to make your pizza and then ""jerk"" it onto the stone waiting in the oven! You cannot get any fat on this stone, so the pizza sticks to the stone and makes a terrible mess. But, you are not supposed to clean it! Just leave it in your oven, always taking up a whole rack. And, if you do clean it and leave it in a cupboard like I did, you will find it MOLDY the next time you take it out! I really hated this stone and I wish I hadn't wasted my money. This is NOTHING like the Pampered Chef stone I used for so many years. It is thick, heavy and seems to be of good quality. Just make sure you understand completely how it is used and make sure you can live with that."
4,gift for a cook,"This oven stone was purchased as a gift for a relative, who was delighted to receive it. And I do have an oven stone of my own and understand her delight. The stone arrived well-packaged and unchipped/unbroken, but only time will tell as to its use-life."
2,Very Poor Packaging,"The product was exactly what we were looking for...unfortunately, the packaging was horrible (the box was much too big, with inadequate packing material). So, we received a very nice pizza stone - which was chipped. Guess we'll just have to make oddly-shaped pizzas, since we wrote to Amazon, but got no response. If you order this product, be sure to ask for someone with basic common sense to be involved in either the packing and/or inspecting of the box."
3,"Practical, but a couple of negative points","I have been meaning to get one of these for a while as this piece of cookware has been recommended to me often by friends. We eat a lot of pizza in my house, from take out to homemade to frozen. On that front the stone does not disappoint. It provides a crispness in the crust that was not there before. It seems to cook more evenly and thorough on the stone. It's also great for reheating leftover pizza. So all good on the usage front.Two negative points-- As recommended, I leave it in the oven all the time. The stone does not have a pleasant odor when heated. The whole house smells of it whenever we are using the oven. Take it out and store it when not in use, you say? It's huge and heavy and takes up a too much space in a cabinet.- Some pizza sauce spilled on it early in use. About 25% of the stone is now black. I know things ""season"" into it as they bake, but I'm now cooking over carbon in some spots, not over stone.Overall, it's just ok."
2,Pizza stone,Dont waste your money. We do not use it and just use the rack in oven Does not crisp crust any better than the rack
2,Old Stone Pizza Stone,"Recently my Pampered Chef pizza stone broke. I had it for over 10 years. I couldn't find the same one, so I tried the Old Stone product. I'm not happy with it. It seems to have a sandy surface. Particles come off into my food. I will keep looking for another Pampered Chef stone."
1,Barely gets one star,"Last year, I bought a Pizza Stone from Pampered Chef. It was a rousing success with my family. For the 5 of us, however, one stone was not enough and I wanted a companion that would help provide two delicious pizzas at one time. Sadly, the product did not come through. My pizza stuck to the stone and had to be scraped off. I tried going against the directions and didn't preheat the stone the second time. It stuck even worse! The pizza didn't get fully done in the middle, while the Pampered Chef pizza was perfect both times. I will be throwing the stone away and ordering the higher priced alternative from Pampered Chef. You get what you pay for!!!"
1,Stone arrived chipped,"Arrived with a large chip on the edge. Amazon's packing seemed adequate but the stone came in a cardboard box from the factory with no padding. I'm returning it for a refund since I have no reason to believe another shipment would fare any better, and I have better things to do than schlep it back and forth to and from the post office.Update: I purchased a stone at a local kitchen wares shop where I could actually view the item before purchasing. I got a decent stone at a reasonable price. Sometimes mom-and-pops are actually preferable to mail order."
3,baking pizza,"We had to return the first stone since it did not come with the cookbook that was to be enclosed. Received the second stone in a very short time. Was disappointed it only can be used in the oven and not on a grill, as we had wanted. It does work well in the oven though. Pizza does bake to perfect doneness so that was good. Still looking for one to use on the grill."
1,Very disappointed!,"Before buying this product I read other reviews and some of them wrote that it was broken when delivered.I thought that it wont happen with me.But I was very disappointed .I received the product in two pieces.It was so hard to manage that i had to throw it away the same day I received .When I received the packet ,I was surprised at the lousy packaging ,and immediately thought no wonder why the stone broke into two pieces.I would not suggest anyone to buy this stone."
5,"16"" pizza stone",We just received our stone and it came in good shape. It came in a box surrounded by peanuts inside of another box surrounded by paper and all inside a very big box :) I read the comments about broken stones but apparently they've addressed that problem. Our first pizza came out crispy and much better than any we ever made on our old (heavy duty) metal pizza pans.
2,disappointed,"After breaking my well weathered Pampered Chef stone, I did lots of research and decided to go with this product. The stone did survive shipping in one piece, and upon opening, the instructions provide the many ways that you shouldn't use this stone, mainly not cooking fatty foods and not slicing your pizza on the stone. I should have sent it back then, knowing how I cook the ingredients are rarely contained to just the pizza, however I decided to give it a shot.The primary drawback is the stone imparts its own flavor on the food you're cooking, not exactly a nasty flavor, but I expect a stone to cook without imparting flavor to the product. The cooking times and texture were comparable with the Pampered Chef stone."
2,Not impressed,This is replacing a Pampered Chef pizza stone which was broken. It is bigger than our old one but doesn't seem to do nearly the same job as the Pampered Chef one. Not terribly happy with the purchase.
1,"Size isn't exactly 13""; not for the Breville","I ordered this pizza stone from my new Breville Smart Oven. I needed a 13"" pizza stone, but not a larger stone. This product arrived in good condition and very quickly, and looks like it would be perfect. However, the stone does not fit into the oven. It just barely doesn't fit. Taking out a tape measure and measuring the stone, it is 13"" on the very top (surface) of the stone, but the thickest part of the stone is probably about 13.25 inches -- the center/middle of the stone. This was enough to make it not fit the oven; I couldn't close the door completely. Frustrating, because it was very close!The surface is 13"", but it widens in middle by just a few tenths of an inch before being 13"" on the bottom again. Close enough for most ovens if you are looking for a 13"" stone, but if you need one EXACTLY 13"" to fit a space -- this is not for you."
1,"Arrived broken, as with many other reviewers","I do my best to purchase everything through Amazon.com (I get points back from my Amazon Visa :)I had seen that some people complained that their pizza stone arrived broken. I rolled the dice and lost. It arrived cracked in half, quite useless.I'm curious what percentage of this item actually arrives at the customer in one piece. It looks good, and those who receive it seem to like it. I just suggest anyone purchasing it be comfortable with the idea of returning the item as well."
1,Arrived in pieces,"Like so many others whose reviews I should have looked closer at, my stone arrived in 3 pieces... how this company stays in business is beyond me.The item shipped in a cardboard box, unwrapped, no peanuts, no bubble wrap, no protection whatsoever... not smart."
5,Outstanding overview for the novice or those even curious about radio,"This book gives a very thorough overview of the world of radio. It discusses in detail the various radio systems in use and how to determine what radio fits your needs. There is a great deal of information on selecting radios for business use, as well as the expected discussion of Ham radio and the use of radios by government agencies and emergency services. The book can be a bit technical in some sections, but from cover to cover it provides a great overview for some interested in understanding a broad range of topics related to radios."
2,Very Elementary (written truly for the dummy),"I believe this book needs an edit to eliminate about 80% of the pages. The book gets to scanning in a very round-about way. Perhaps the book is meant for those who never took a high-school physics class; As an example, it is compelled to explain what a radio frequency is. If you just bought a scanner that can be programmed, you will note no mention of how to plan the programming for a particular interest or area. I suggest you buy the least expensive (programmable) scanner and one of several programming packages to learn from. I also suggest reviewing [...] which is a free web site listing most frequencies used in the USA."
5,Good Info,"Though I have'nt finished it yet,this book joins Ward's otherbooks,in being easy to read and understand.David N5SJS"
5,I loved this book!,"This book was a real pleasure to read. It is a wonderfully written account of one family's experience of raising a child with Autism. I love that it is written from the parent's perspective. I also liked that the book also included excerpts from other family members, friends, and professionals/teachers. I would recommend it to anyone!"
1,Where's the beef?,"Hi, I am a parent of a child with autism, also very high functioning. I thought this book might be insightful or inspirational. There is no real depth from the parents, and you get no real sense of the steps they took to help their child. I am thrilled for them that their son is doing so well, but this book is only good for someone who has read very little and/or has a extremely high functioning child. I would not recommend it."
5,A Real Pageturner,"Even though I have known Rhonda and Jordan for several years, once I started reading the book I couldn't put it down. It's a fascinating roller coaster ride through all the emotional ups and downs of family life with an autistic child. I knew Rhonda was an awesome mom but I had no idea how hard it must have been for her at times. I have the utmost respect for Rhonda and her willingness to share her story with others so they may benefit.What a gift she and Jordan have given to the rest of us. Thanks!!"
3,No more perhaps less,Revisited a product I have liked before. After first wearing the leather finish was flimsier and scratched off with absolutely minimal abuse. Price held steady over time but the quality suffered.Still comfortable and true to size.
4,Fingers crossed,"Had mixed feelings about ordering these, as they seem identical to the last pair of black Florsheim that I bought. Those, after very light wear (perhaps 8 times in the year I had them) had a broken sole.They do fit exactly like the Florsheims.The rubber soles are very slippery out of the box, but once they roughen up, normal traction.These are slightly stiffer than the Florsheims I've bought in the past, but not uncomfortably so.Time will tell, fingers crossed."
4,Good value,I always buy this type of shoe but this is my first time for Bostonian.They are very comfortable and at a decent price.
4,Sweet and endearing...a true love story!,"This is a touching story about two people who loved each other. Matera's journalistic style is fresh and wide-eyed, and the reader is pulled in from the beginning. Putting it down once started is not an option. It compels the reader to find out when they are next able to meet. Their joys and sadnesses are shared so vividly that they become real. This is not a book to be taken lightly. Curl up on a Saturday morning and spend the day reading."
2,Is it true ...??,"After reading this book, I am still wondering if its true. How can such a secret be kept by so many of Elvis' ""friends"" when they were with him 24/7? Until a DNA is proof, I'm not going to believe one word of it.I don't think he could have gotten away with such a secret for so long."
2,lonely book,"As an avid Elvis fan, I was really disappointed with this book. I went in very cautiously, not wanting to believe a word of it. The more I read, the more I started to believe Lucy's story. As the book went on I got bored with the same story telling, the same lines, the same everything. By the end of the book, I was still skeptical. Nowhere is Lucy mentioned in his life. Any other biographies omit her name completely. With that many people in Elvis' life at that time someone would know something more than what is told. I'm not sure of the story being true. I am sure of the story being pretty boring at times. Worth reading? Sure, if you can get it for a penny plus shipping."
5,The BEST book about Elvis,This is the best book I have read about Elvis and his true love and the daughter he never knew about. I have read this book over and over until the pages have fallen out. It makes me cry every time. I can only imagine what life would be like if he were still alive today. I suggest this to all Elvis fans - young and old
2,Needs Wall Power,"Do not buy this drive if you're looking for portability in the field. It did not mount on my Mac PowerBook G4 without an additional AC adapater, not included. LaCie tech service sent one at no charge, but this defeats the purpose of their ""rugged"" ""all-terrain"" product."
3,"No problems, process takes a while, read manual before starting","No problems. It does take a long time to back up though. I expected a quicker process, but it took a good 30 minutes. Maybe that's normal, I've never backed up a computer before. Be sure to read the manual too, it's not intuitive to figure out. I do like the spongy frame since we leave it in a drawer when not in use."
3,Does the job,"I've never had any major problems with this drive. I use it primarily to store music and so I play my libraries directly from the drive on different laptops. I never have delays when streaming music off, but when initially accessing the drive or hopping around inside folders there is always a slight response delay, hence the 3 stars. I've used other portable external drives with less downtime. The size and rubber edging is great- you can toss it around in a large bag without a second thought."
4,Does the Job,"My fiance and I bought this earlier this year with the purchase of our new computer and we're happy with the product. It's easy to use, copies files quickly and offers a safety option to avoid damaging your hard drive/computer when disconnecting. We also enjoy the distinct look of the hard drive, fitted with a shock resistant rubber bumper so you can take it with you, and it's compatible with Vista."
1,LaCie,"I was never able to download this drive onto my computer. It would not show up on the desktop as instructed. When I asked help, I was told to send it back."
2,paint ball pellets,"i am not pleased with this shipment. When I ordered them they came within the stated time but when I opend the box the paintball has some broke and paint was all over. most sticking to each other. the packing was nil and probably would have helped from the pellets breaking. I did call the company, they were very good at replacing the order. BUT again no packing and the balls came broke and paint all over. I will give them another call. I will be taking pictures and sending the package back. I will not be ordering pellets from them again. I have no problem with the price. JUST THE WAY THEY SHIP"
5,Great!,"Great Deal .. We haven't used the paint balls yet, but it was a great price. We checked some local stores and it was hard to find paint ball stuff were we lived. This shipped very quickly!"
1,Good read but,"""The Only Living Witness"" is an excellent showcase into the mind of Ted Bundy but this book is the worst edition to have come out..I have the 1983 edition and not only does it have pictures,it's also more detailed when compared to this edition..The latest edition of 1999 omits so much of information that it ends up making the book incomplete..Plus the spelling mistakes are irritating..No pictures!!So many things were left out that I regret even buying this edition..Ted Bundy was a very complex man to understand and if you want to really get a more detailed picture of the man,I would suggest the 1983 edition..I have ordered but not yet received the 1991 edition and I heard it's even better than the 1983 version.."
4,Very close to what might have happened. Great read!!,"Ive read many books about Ted, and this is one of the best. Second only to ""Hunt for the green river killer"" This books theories seem to be pretty close to what might have happened."
3,nice book,"nice book, but dont expect too much ""bloody"" details, the authors seem more focused on explaining the facts and prosecution then reporting about the murders it self."
4,"Fascinating Inside Look At ""The Entity""","This is a well-written and researched account of Ted Bundy's interviews given to the authors, who at one time assisted the defense lawyers in researching Bundy's crimes. Bundy, who refused to confess to the authors, spoke of the murders in the third person, as if he was trying to explain to the authors what kind of mentality would do these crimes and what actions and feelings the murderer would have.This fiction results in a devastating, chilling account from Bundy himself -- an obviously educated, intelligent and thoughtful person who also happened to be an uncontrollable mass murderer.I had trouble putting this one down."
3,Just ok,"I bought this violin after dicovering that my full-size violin was just too big for me. As a novice student, I practice frequently. I've only had this violin for about a year, and since the purchase I had to have the tail piece repaired after it fell apart and snapped off. I had to have the bridge recut and all the strings replaced to improve the sound quality.My instructor says it is a decent piece of equipment for the price, but I miss my full size Cremona."
1,Avoid anything by this Author!,"Any puzzle Solution Books by Karen Peebles, or the Association to Solve, or any other aliases that this person or persons are coming up with, should be avoided. They are all self published and offer haphazard solutions that are generally very difficult to follow. Read the reviews!"
5,Pass Me Another Piece of Cake!!,Excellent Blues. Great Harmonica riffs! Catchy lyrics. It will have you humming & uttering the words long after the songs have been played. It's music cake that sticks to your ribs.
3,Not as sturdy,"We have a big, heavy cabinet in the baby room and I am so paranoid about it falling on my baby that I bought three types of furniture straps. The idea was that I could be guaranteed that at least one of the products would work. Anyways Safety First product was better quality and sturdier than this one. This product is ok for a piece of furniture that isn't that heavy. Go with Safety First for %100 piece of mind."
1,Absolutely horrid,"I bought this CD hoping for something to alternate with my wonderful ""Sleep Soundly"" CD by Steven Halpern. What a mistake. In my opinion, this music can in no way be considered calming or sleep-inducing. From its very first track, there are irritating piercing sounds which not only grab your attention but are unpleasantly shrill. And as the CD plays out, the music seems to get louder. I'm not even going to pass this on to anyone; it's going straight into the trash can."
4,"A Good Overview of the ADA law, but there are some changes in the law since it was written","A Good Overview of the ADA law, but there are some changes in the law since it was written. For a lawyer not familiar with the ADA the article does provide some important traps to avoid. It has merit still, but you need to be aware of changes in the law since it was written."
3,quilting with strips and strings,The contents of the book was quite good but the poor quality of the paper and the lack of coloured pictures made it somewhat uninteresting.
3,Good but not enough,Explanations of stripping technics are good but lack examples of what blocks would look like in a quilt. This is a serious defect.
4,Swear by them,All i use.Sturdy construction and easy to see.Dont get thrown by the cheaper Polar brand of similar design.
4,Positive spin on Cheerleading,"My daughter really wanted a cheerleader Barbie for Christmas. I was thrilled to see a set on Amazon that included 2 Barbies! I couldn't find it in stores anywhere! The platform is pretty sturdy on a smooth surface. The instructions were simple to follow and my daughter really loves playing with it. I like that it shows that cheerleaders are athletic too. It's a stretch, but it demonstrates that it takes more than a cute face and outfit to be able to flip. Now she wants to take cheernastics so she can flip like Barbie."
2,"Okay, but...","As a brief, factual account of Islamic history, this seemed adequate. It's an easy read, certainly. But I found as I went on that the author occasionally makes sweeping, blanket generalizations that make less and less sense the more you think about them, such as the observation that ""agriculture-based empires had a limited lifespan prior to modern times."" (In fact, we have no idea about the lifespan of any ""modern"" regime, whereas certain pre-modern agriculture-based regimes, such as Egypt and China, are famous for their longeveity.)While I found no factual errors in the author's central matter, these sweeping statements do not lead one to trust in the author's interpretations."
2,Very basic,"Some basic, very basic information on the subject. Something I would feel proper for a teenager. If you go to wekipedia you might be able to get more out of it than from this tiny book. Sorry!"
2,"""Romantic"" Islam","Ms. Armstrong has produced what is undeniably an entertaining and encouraging (in that it presents a positive view of Islam)book. It must be emphasized, however that this cannot be seen as a work of scholarship, as Ms. Armstrong is content to accept uncritically too many ""facts"" from sources which are completely biased. This said, one is left wishing that the founder of Islam(If, in fact there actually was a historical Mohammed)and its subsequent propagators really were as Ms. Armstrong presents them. In any case, readers wishing to obtain a balanced view of the sociocultural phenomenon now widely know as ""Islam"", will find it useful to compare this idealised presentation with that of more critical treatments."
2,Biased,"A good short history but very biased. Armstrong concludes her book with: ""The West has not been wholly responsible for the extreme forms of Islam, which have cultivated violence ... But the West has certainly contributed to this development ..."" Give me a break! This does not explain why Muslim Sunnis kill Shii Muslims. ..... For a more realistic view I recommend ""Islam Unveiled"" by Robert Spencer."
1,Convent with a View,Karen Armstrong might as well have stayed in the convent. Her world view has not expanded much since then.She has used her freedom of speech and I support her in that. I would love to see her visit her friends in Saudi Arabia and try to exercise her freedom of speech there.
3,One-Sided,"Karen Armstrong's introduction to Islam is a quick, interesting read. If you are interested in Islam, it's worthwhile; however, do not make it your only source. Armstrong's facts are mostly accurate, but she glosses over the less pleasant aspects of Islam. Like any philosophy, religion, or culture, Islam has its good and bad sides. Armstrong focuses solely on the good. It's an exercise in tolerance, but not necessarily in truth."
2,"Great, short and well balanced","I congratulate Karen Armstrong on a job well done. I Agree with some critics that the book is too short, however, for a detail history one can read Bernard Lewis's ""The Middle East"".I think this is a great resource for Muslims and non-Muslims alike. There are large numbers of Muslims in this world thathave no clue of the history, politics and development of Islam, this book solve the problem in 186 pages."
3,You could skip the middle,"I read this book looking for a concise explanation of Islam. I found it at the front and end parts of the book. The author clearly tells you why she thinks that many people in the West have an incorrect view of Islam. I found that interesting. The middle of the book is mostly packed full of forgetable dates, names and events that I do not think will help most readers understand Islam any better."
3,TBT,"Excellent beginning and excellent ending, but the middle was quite dense and difficult to follow. I expected a short history to be more general, accessible, easy to read and obtain a broad picture of the religion. Instead, this short history seems to pack the data of a 700 page book into 160 pages. I would have liked more general commentary about development and branches of Islam rather than the dates and accomplishments of ever caliph in the middle ages. Still, I have a much better understanding of what Islam is, how it developed, why it is what it is today. I would recommend it to anyone will to devote the time to it."
2,Read the first half...,"I particularly enjoyed the beginning, as it outlined the establishment of the faith and Muhammad's life. It was very condensed, which made it difficult to follow in places, and I think that it could have been written in a more clear and straightforward manner. My biggest qualm with the book was that it seemed to me to be overly politically correct and preachy in tone. This was particularly the case towards the conclusion. It wasn't preachy in terms of trying to convert people to Islam, but the author seemed to take the view that the reader was predisposed to have a negative view of Islam. I got irritated by the use of phrases such as ""you must realize..."" and I wish the portrayal of the faith had been more unbiased, with no agenda, and purely historical."
4,"Short, but a good start for those interested in Islam","It is hard to put 15 centuries of human history into a volume this size, but for beginners it is a helpful start. Her wonderful biography of Muhammad is the next place to go, if the subject interests you. It appears some reviewers are so filled with hatred that they cannot even let a non-Muslim like Armstrong fairly describe Islam without screaming ""apologist!"" The reader below who equates Islam with Sept 11. and his experiences in Saudi Arabia would probably be unhappy with those who speak of Christainity in terms of abortion clinic bombers, or Judaism in terms of Meir Kahane's racism. Hate is always a sign of weakness and low self-esteem. As is evidenced by some of these reviews, hate is truly a worldwide disease that knows no religion but masks itself behind every one."
3,Tries to Cover Too Much,"Karen Armstrong attempts to cover nearly 1400 years of Islamic history in 180 pages in this wide ranging book. Perhaps too large a topic for such a short book, Armstrong takes the reader from the background of the Prophet Mohammed to a discussion of the Taliban and fundamentalism.Much of the book reads like a chronology, with little depth into the whys of what happened. While Armstrong does a good job of providing access to the Western reader on the basics of Islam and the history behind it - including the emphasis of the political-religious entanglement at its heart, the book feels like a fire hose or a ride through a flume - moving so fast that you never really get to enjoy the experience.If you are looking for a very basic history by an author well versed in comparative theology, you may enjoy the book. For this reader, it was too much history packed into too small a tome."
1,Politically correct lies,"Why defend a religion who's holy book hates and despises Jews, Christians and Pagans, and commands husbands to beat their wives.Of course there have been cases of brilliant people even under Islamic domination, e.g. Omar Khayan, but to attribute their achievements to Islam, is like attributing Galileo's achievements to Catholicism."
3,A Bit of Bias With Your Analysis,"Armstrong's book is interesting, providing some useful historical background for those who are brand new to to the topic and looking for a short primer on the history of islam. The problem, as some of the other reviewers have pointed out, is that Armstrong has clearly taken a side. As the chronology winds along and brings us to the modern era of radicalization and extremists, she asserts that it is the fault of the West that some Muslims have become violent radicals. That's just silly, of course, but speaks volumes about Armstrong's agenda. Not a bad book overall, but not balanced. If you want an introduction to Islam, you'll have to read more than this one volume to get a more even-handed assessment."
1,Like reading a 200 page speech,"My one star review is based on my feeling that this book is less a history than one woman's approx 200 page speech on Islam. It is a shame because the first pages which did straight forward recounting of history were very interesting, but then the author just begins opinionating. Even if you are sympathetic to her opinions it is still a very diffult read as any long speech becomes boring after a while. A real shame as this subject deserved a better book."
1,Not objective,"When I read a history book, I prefer to have facts presented in an objective manner. This book is seriously flawed by the author's incessant and often illogical opinions of why events took place. I prefer that opinion pieces [pro or con] be clearly labeled as such - to label this book as a ""history"" is a disservice to the reader. For those of us searching for a neutral, objective history of Islam this book is a disappointment."
4,good standard stuff,"Happy reading --- this is such a widely used book, it would be wrong to ignore it. It could do with a bit more freshening up so that it doesn't come across so densely but then I suppose, it would be a much longer book and that would reduce its interest or readership to people. To study this fascinating subject, you do need to have a lot of patience and to read lots and lots which is why I think a longer book is better.The last section of the book which is on suggestions for further reading will probably date quite quickly since so much has been published at the moment but nevertheless, almost everything else apart from chapter 5 (which is largely about the current and future situations) will stand unchanged for a long time. There are few better books on the subject and this is definitely a good start for someone embarking on this study."
1,a discredited author,"Cannot understand that anyone still wants to read a book so biased. The author is well known on prejudice and political correctness.If you want to understand Islam, first read books by the most authoritative scholar Bernard Lewis including ""What Went Wrong?"", ""The Crisis of Islam"", ""The Middle East"". Then, there are books by Robert Spencer, such as ""Islam Unveiled,"" ""The Truth About Muhammad,"" Especially in the last book, Robert Spencer pointed out Karen Armstrong's serious errors on key points.Just saw a news item: Afghan police say man killed wife for wanting job [...]"
4,A Good Intro,"Although this book covers a lot of material very quickly, I think it is a good place to start for someone learning about Islam. It gives general outline of the Islamic empire's history and also mentions many of the major Islamic thinkers and philosophers, such as Ibn Rushd, Ibn Sina and Al Ghazzali. It definitely gives a sense of the diversity in the faith, from Falsafa to Sufism, and gives the reader a chance to explore these other, less mainstream, sides of Islam. Not the only book you should read on Islam, but a good start."
4,Useful primer on Islam,"Christians become rightly perturbed when their religion is represented through the prism of the Spanish Iniquisition, the age of daily witch-burnings, the slaughter of Catholics by early Protestants, the slaughter of Protestants by Catholics, the slaughter of Native Americans by Protestants and Catholics, or, to give a more recent example, the Bosnian massacres. Christians rightly protest that their faith is best understood through their noble efforts towards peace and compassion.Karen Armstrong, ever mindful of the injunction to do unto others as one would have them do unto you, treats the Islamic faith just as Christians would like to have their faith regarded. In this spirit of even-handedness, she compacts a great deal of information into this small book, but leaves the essential historical outline clear. This book is merely an introduction, but it is a fine one."
3,Educational,"This book was already on the printing presses when Sept 11, 2001, attacks took place.By chance, it was timely, and for those with little time on their hands this is a good brief overview. I found it helpful but left me wanting to chew on more.An excellent starting point for someone wanting to learn about Islam would be to combine this small tome with a modern translation of the Koran, avalable on bookstores (and online, for free)."
4,An Outline History,"Truth in advertising: This is a ""short history."" For a brief introduction to the Islamic experience, I encourage you to peruse these pages. You'll get a whirlwind tour of 1400 years of Islam. The prose is serviceable, if sometimes dry, especially towards the middle of the book; you may get the feeling that you're reading one of those lengthy, well written articles found in former editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. For early twenty-first century Americans, this book should be required reading. Armstrong opened my eyes to a subject I know little about, and has sent me searching for further information on some of the important Islamic literature she describes--if using an economy of words."
1,A book that denies the suffering of Christians,"Denying the suffering of Christians under Moslem rule is what Armstrong wants the reader to do. The denial of Christian suffering by Christians who lived among Moslems is a phenomenon that is always overlooked. As Christians living in Egypt, neither Armstrong, if she were a man, nor I could marry a Moslem woman unless we convert to Islam; as Christians neither Armstrong nor I would be allowed entrance to some Arab cities; as Christians, neither Armstrong nor I would be allowed to build a church without permission from the President of Egypt. Why is Armstrong quiet about that? Why is she not admitting or revealing the prohet's persecution of pagans and other non-Moslems?"
2,"By all means a short cut history book, nothing more.","The author had just put the histories of all Islam related tribes, countries and empires into this single book. That's all. Very politically correct, resulting a very plain, and even shallow description of a ""seemingly"" loosely related group of people labeled as ""Muslims"", talking little about their religious beliefs and the driving force behind the many historical and religious events.In short, not recommended, unless you want to find a book that allows you to do some copy and paste for your secondary school history homework."
5,Now I understand,"Outstanding book! I thought I was a pretty bright guy, but I found out how little I really new about Islam and found out how much of what I thought I knew about Islam was garbage. I may not agree with what they say or do, but at least now I understand why they do and can understand the reasons.I think that anyone who thinks that they have an opinion about the Middle East should read this book."
4,Armstrong's Islamic leanings don't detract from the book,"Karen Amstrong remains ""free-lance"" in many ways. However, as far as I can determine, her research and presentation of the facts (dates, names, etc.) are - as usual - excellent. One finishes the book with the impression that Armstrong has strong leanings toward Islam; perhaps that is only my perception. One must conclude that the ""accretions"" (traditions not found in the Qur'an) of Islam today (in 2001) are as widespread as they are in almost every ""religion."" One must also conclude that there are as many divisions in Islam today (2001) as in any other ""religion"" on the planet. Read it for history; read it to realize how far many Muslims have strayed from the Qur'an (which is no different from Christians straying from the Bible, etc.); read it to learn. As ""Jerry"" once said, ""It's a good read."" (If you get the ""Jerry"" part, email me. It has nothing to do with religion.)"
1,Misleading,"For a true picture of Islam read""Thirteen Lessons in Political Islam""and""Sharia Law for Non-Muslims""by Bill Warner"
2,cute but not durable,"This drive, while it works well and is reliable functionally, is cheaply made and does not hold up on daily use. Perhaps its virtue is its main drawback: to make it so small, it has to be made of not-so-durable materials.To me, its small size isn't worth the significant problem it has."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I bought this exact home test. The morning of my lab test I tested at home first out of curiosity. It said 200. A week after testing at the lab, the results came back as 263! That is way off and products like this shouldn't be on the market. There are too many people that don't go to Doctor's and this testing kit is not accurate by any means!"
1,lancette sucks,"I bought this test kit to keep track of total cholesterol, but never got a chance to evaluate the results because the lancette device provided didn't provide enough blood (two tries) even though I followed the instructions to the letter."
1,Can I give this a Zero?,"There is absolutely nothing GOOD to say about this product.First Check Home Cholesterol Test, Two Single Use TestsI followed directions exactly - to the letter. Even using a countdown timer on my cell phone.I got no results. I tried it AGAIN (there are two test strips included). Again, no results at all. Not wrong ones... but nothing at all. And the kit isn't expired, and the testing strips were in their protective envelopes.My wallet is $20 lighter. I have two sore fingers full of holes and a bunch of nasty bloody things to get rid of.Sheesh, they don't even include an alcohol swab in the kit.And they don't bother to recommend that you sterilize your fingers or even wash your hands before you go stabbing yourself full of holes.Shame on you, First Check."
4,"Funny this test used to have a 4 star rating, what happened?",and test itself advertises a 97% accuracy. Would you be ableto sell such a product based on such a large misrepresentation?
2,1 out of 4,"This gives you total cholesterol, you need to get your total cholesterol, LDL, HDL & Triglycerides. If you don't understand why, then you should have your test done at your doctor's office.A little knowledge is dangerous; a little information and no knowledge is stupid."
1,I felt that this book lacks substance!!!,I just feel sorry for this lawyer who needs to attract attention by betraying his own people!
5,S100 Cleaner,"The S100 cleaner I bought works great on my motorcycle windshield, my riding glasses, my regular glasses, and my TV screen. I like all the S100 products for my motorcycle. The cleaners for metal and chrome leave my scooter lookin' GREAT. All I have to do is spray it on, apply a little elbow grease, and she just glistens in the sunlight!"
3,Alana's review,"I enjoyed this book. I found both positive and negative thngs about it, but would overall recommend it, because of the message that is sent about God.Initially, I found it to be somewhat dull at times. I didn't like the way it began because it didn't go into what happened to their son. Also, I felt more details were needed regarding Marvin's walking out on Shay. I wasn't completely convinced that Daniel was satisfied in his singleness and thought they left Vickie's issue of being single was left open. What did she do about being in love with Daniel?The positive side was that it reflected a good sense of a relationship and how hard communication can be at times. I liked the struggles that each character faced. Especially the dialog that took place between Shay and Vickie (when Vickie confronted Shay about her actions toward Martin)I thouroughly enjoyed the exhaltation to seek God, no matter what we feel or think of ourselves."
3,Officially released bootleg?,"It started out okay (maybe 3.5 stars), only to find the sound quality deteriorates gradually (ends with 1 star). The last and Bill's best tune Waltz for Debby is almost inaudible and doesn't even start from the very beginning. I also noticed that, as if to escape from getting caught, the microphone was moving toward the end of this CD, and the sound gets ""shaded."" This may suggest that this was an armature bootleg live recording. Unless you are a collector or Bill Evans freak, you'd be better off avoiding this CD, simply because it's not worth the money.There are much better recordings of similar tunes and periods available, such as Quiet Now and Serenity from Charly Records."
5,all on the real,"this book is the straight up Truth. i mean going to the doctors and whatnot and being Black its a whole different exprience. you get talked to first can you pay? then you get told what is wrong with you because you are Black and this and that. so much stereotyping politics even before you get into why you are there. of course the history of this country and taken care fo Balck patients is a Horror film all unto itself. Arthur Ashe spoke about being Black and dealing with the doctors and so forth in his Book and this Book goes even further. very well researched and put together and it is the stone cold truth. you ain't ever going to read this in Schools, go pick up a couple of copies one for you and the other for a friend and read it completely because this book is all on the real about what really goes done."
3,Good information.,"While I think the book was needed and contains some valuable lessons and truth--there are some things that the author asserts that are subject to debate.The author tries to equate medical students being photographed as the same as those persons who hunted down people and lynched them. While the method of obtaining bodies for research was truly sickening, the med students photographed are not smiling over their ""kill"". The comparison is just not there."
3,Interesting Subject...,"Interesting subject to write on, but in the end, this book just serves as another channel for the stereotypical black ""the world done me wrong"" mindset. Despite the endless stacks of literature on discrimination against black Americans and enslavement of them, there is relatively nothing about the enslavement of --and discrimination against-- Irish Americans. Despite there being more Irish slaves in the Americas during the 17th century, their history has conveniently been forgotten and replaced only with unrelenting grievance against black slavery. Now, even though Irish people were often given even less of a lawful backing in every area of social injustice, they've become the most educated class in the United States-- holding the highest amount of PHD and high graduate degrees per capita. Same/worse discrimination, x1000 success, without the endless NYT-lauded books/novels condemning any segment of society with light skin and/or money. Even if it was hard earned."
4,Scary read...How far have we truly come?,"This was a very comprehensive book. The author clearly states in the preface what her goals were in writing this book, which I think she does a great job of. However, being knowledgeable in the science field myself, I feel that there are a few flaws in her presentation of some of her research. I think at times it leaves one open to question the validity or the specific correlations of some studies mentioned.Overall, one does get a pretty good depiction of ""medical apartheid"" and it's definitely a VERY scary one! It really makes one question how far we have come from the civil rights movement.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the medical profession, African-American studies or just an informative, interesting read."
5,"Accurate, thorough, shocking.","It is clear from the thorough treatment of the subject, the suprisingly constructive conclusion, and the rich, powerful prose of Medical Apartheid that Harriet Washington is a genius. For dealing with such controversial and emotionally charged issues her tone is far more expository than accusatory, and she masterfully explains the history that has led our country to its current state of inequality. Her message is hopeful and clearly summarized. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in inequalities in medical treatment in the United States."
3,"Shocking -- but not really, given what we know of injustice in history","If your faith in humanity is already at an all-time low, don't expect this book to be in any way uplifting or to provide any hope for the future. It is, however, very worth reading, bringing to light the many, many medical transgressions suffered by African Americans in the US, from the medical torture of slaves who could not object, all the way up to pharmaceutical company experiments in the 20th century whose objectives, procedures and side-effects were not disclosed to (and, in fact, were purposely kept from) their subjects.While the subject matter was interesting and, at times, even fascinating, the author seemed to go in circles within the earlier chapters. By midway through the book she finds her stride."
5,It's always useful to be reminded...,"Although I would like to think that I couldn't be tempted (as a medical researcher) to break the rules and to impair human dignity, it was a very disturbing eye-opener to read this book! It made me remember a few events in my medical education when I saw my teachers cross the line, not as dramatically as most of what Washington portrays, but nevertheless the start of the slippery slope, and I know the temptations to ""cut corners"" in pursuing your goal of completing your research project. Once you give in to that, much worse can follow. I agree with other reviewers that this book has rendered a great service and should be required reading."
4,Basics of Video Lighting,"Señores de Amazon: Este libro puede ayudar a todas las personas interesadas en conocer los aspectos basicos de la iluminacion en video, tales como: las diferencias y semejanzas de iluminar en cine o en video, los tipos de luces,el balance, los filtros, iluminar de dia de noche y sobretodo como aprender a iluminar en estudios de tv. Parece un libro para todo aquel quiere empezar desde cero. GraciasDear amazon: I think this book will help us to know about the concept of lighting,video and light, and all about filters, white balance, day and light, and set lighting on TV. This book will be necessary to people who need general and basics knolegement. Thank you Miguel"
4,Good for midsize SLR.,"This bag is big enough for ONE camera with ONE normal zoom attached (I have the DSLR-A100 with 18-70 zoom). There is some sort of a ""lock"" to to hold the flap the being completely opened in ""auto"" mode when the zipper is not closed completely.Unless, if the bag is very stuffed... I think....Your bag will still look kind of lumpy with your SLR in, but since I don't want a HUGE backpack, the 212 works for me.I do not recommand this bag if you have something like a Canon 1Ds with a extended battery pack and a standard zoom."
2,Uncomfortable,"Although the bag itself is well made, the strap system is VERY uncomfortable. Looking at Kata's website it seems they updated the strap system to resemble that of the T-214. The T-212 I got from Amazon, however, had a different main strap and was so uncomfortable that I returned it promptly."
1,Kata T-212,I have this sling and don't like it. It ends up hurting your back and doesn't fit snuggly. I wanted a smaller bag to carry around my Canon 5d when traveling... while this sling can do that it ended up being a pain to carry around airports. This ends up being heavey and cumbersome. Look else where.
5,sockets,"quality construction comes in a nice case ,very inexpensive a nice produt .I needed something to have at work that would stay organized ,a very good buy."
5,Very fast paced and entertaining,"I was new to the punisher series...having bought the last episode of up is down and black is white i was a little curious about the title, so on my trip to the bookstore i picked up mother russia and bought it. It was an amazing read...garth ennis was born to write this book. Filled with action, humor...and in a weird way sentimentality...ennis's ideas sometimes feel recycled from preacher though...and its not altogether bad...but a little more would go a long waythe art was excellent....baithwraite's punisher seemed aggressive even in panels where there was no action...like a caged animal waiting to strike....there was a certain beauty to it, a certain grit to the faces and expressions...perhaps he is the best artist for this title after dillon. cant wait for more"
4,Into Siberia,"Great art hampered by a story that is an odd fit for The Punisher. Now not to say that the story was bad, but it just didn't fit the Punisher mold for me. The characters in the story were great though. I truly love the Russian General. The part about the Punisher killing Russian soldiers bothered me a bit. Not too sure how the Punisher would feel about that. Worth a read but not one that I will read until the covers fall off."
2,not enough info for a chicago fire buff,has a great bselection of rigs from all over the country. but I am a fan of chicagos f.d. and equiptment.
1,sticker fail,These stickers have amazing adhesive. Unfortunately it's stronger than the layers of the paper that they are stuck to. And the die that cut the stickers out seems to have gone too deep as well. The end result is that when you try to take a sticker off the page you invariably come away with the sticker plus a layer of paper which is nearly impossible to separate from the back of the sticker as it is cut to size. Very frustrating.I would not buy these again.
4,Stickers tear easily,I'm an addict who is trying to get off OTC sleeping pills. Each day I put up a sticker when I haven't abused any pills. I'm now at day 322. It is nice to see the sparkling colors on my calender to show my success.The only problem I have with these stickers is that it is hard to get them out of the book without tearing them.
1,When stickers go wrong...,The stickers won't come off the page. It was difficult for me to peel the stickers there is no way a child could do it. You are better off going to the dollar store.
3,"Nice Stickers, But Overpriced","I got these stickers to motivate my students, and it definitely worked. They LOVE these stickers. However, they are a bit overprice, and they don't come off the page very easily. After paying $8 for these stickers, I found very similar stickers (without the sparkles) for $1 at the Dollar Tree. The sparkles are nice, but if you want variety or need quantity, I wouldn't necessary stick with these."
2,Not worth it,These stickers would be great if you could peel them off the paper without them tearing.....it happended to half of them or more.

2,Wellll--,"This is great if you have all the time and money to spend on Hors D'Oeuvres--I would not buy it again, but it was fun to look at."
2,This one should be sent to the Scrabble graveyard.,"A friend of mine bought this version of Scrabble, since it was a bit cheaper than the Deluxe version. She would have been better off spending a bit more and buying the Deluxe one. The hinges on the Michael Graves board eventually separate from the wood. It's not as sturdy as a regular Scrabble board--even the cheaper, basic board.The other problem with the Michael Graves design is that the tiles are too small to fit the squares on the board nicely. The wooden tiles on standard boards will fit perfectly into their squares, but the harder plastic (?) tiles in the Michael Graves design are a bit too small, which means you have to leave small gaps between the tiles when you're spelling long words.Michael Graves is a good designer for other things, but the world of Scrabble would have been better without his contribution."
2,TROGGS - 'Live' (Rollercoaster),"Sorry to have to admit that I was pretty let down with this 2-CD release. Disc one is a forty-two minute live 1999 performance of the Troggs - with two original members, vocalist Reg Presley and guitarist Chris Britton. Even though the guys do their best on gems like ""I Can't Control Myself"", their Buddy Holly cover ""Peggy Sue"", ""Feels Like A Woman"" and ""Wild Thing"", it remains a fact that 'Live' [at least] on disc one just doesn't make the grade. Plain and simply, the live recording sounds weak and lifeless. However, perhaps all isn't lost. Disc two turns out to be a decent interview with Reg Presley as he covers a variety of subjects. Plus the cover is quite a piece of work. Strictly for British Invasion and Troggs completists."
3,Alot of non US releases from the Bellamys.,"This Cd is like an import. The songs are not old, there just not on any US release Cd, or Lp for that matter going way back. They have a huge following in other countries, so trying to stay up with everything they release is rather hard due to the fact alot is just released in other countries. Try one of the 2011 or 2012 Cds, they sound alot more like a rock band on those cds. But I've been a fan for 36 years, so I must like the."
1,Tabu by DANA,I received this product. I have been using it for many years. The product I expected to receive is the one as shown in the picture. That is not what I received. I received a different bottle. I did not check the ounces. I'm certain it's still 3 ounces. The content is still the fragrance I purchased.
1,Not the Same,This item did not come in the bottle described. The bottle is different and wasn't what I ordered for my friend.
3,Needs a moral at the end of each chapter.,"To really understand the true meaning of each chapter, not all people can fully understand or let's say read between the lines."
2,Rousseau once more,"Under cover of helping people know themselves and getting self-assurance, this book presents once again the old discredited thesis by Jean Jacques Rousseau: people are originally good, but society and its temptations (pride, ambition) make them bad. This is inserted in a new-age, Spinozian, Einsteinian view that God is the same as the Universe and you are one with the Universe. I disagree with this view, therefore didn't find the book as wonderful as others did. It may be useful for someone who has sank to the depths of desperation, but there are not so many of these. I think the success of the book is really related to the fact that it says, not what people need to hear, but what they want to hear."
4,The Jnight in Rusty Armor,This is a book that by reading it I was able to take a better look at my life and myself. I think that any one seeking to better themselves might be able to find some of the questions we look for...
4,"Introspective Message for men, young and old.",This is an excellant short read. We all need to re-examine our priorities and refresh our goals.
3,Thought Provoking,"I think this is an excellent book for the busy dad. It reminds us how our ""quest"" for success can cloud our judgement and blind us to the things that are really important. [...]."
5,Must Read For Spiritual Seekers With Very Little Time Or Children,"This book was recommended to me by my friend John after we talked about what it really means for a book or movie to be ""spiritual."" John's recommendation was right on the money, too.This was one of the few books where the character truly is on a spiritual path of self-discovery... of becoming one with his true nature. As a parent, my favorite element of this book was that it uses relatively simple language and easy metaphors, and is also a short quick read.Not only did I enjoy it thoroughly, I look forward to reading it to my son when he gets older. For anybody who has children that enjoy being read to, this is a must-have."
4,The Knight in Rusty Armor,"This is a very good, very easy read. I especially enjoyed the humor that accompanied the serious focus of the book. My son needed the book to write a reaction paper for a college class, and I believe it is a good book for new students to read and write about."
5,This one is a keeper to be reread again and again.,"Basic psychology about self awareness and love written in clever and witty style. Simple truth with a profound message that could be read to or by anyone of any age. Do yourself a favor, read it, you will be glad you did."
5,An easy read that carries a big message,"I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about themselves... the book is written on a child's level, and I think if all 4th graders would read this, they might avoid some of the common mistakes made by so many as we grow up."
5,awesome,"nice bright colors, it will make a beautiful afghan I love to crochet, and I could find this color anywhere, thank you"
4,Nine Strange Stories,"Nine Strange StoriesI first read this book as an early teen, and had to read it again as an adult. This collection of stories is TRULY strange...some very eerie, some unbelievable, and yet - could they be true? The stories stay with you for a long time. I got lost in the writing, as the descriptions take you right into the story and captivate you. Will definitely keep a teen's interest. I would say this book is for teenagers, as the words and writing style would not be easy for younger readers."
5,If You Are Searching/This Book's For You,"This is a great book. I find it so because I have come to the place of being dissatisfied with fundamentalist Christianity, and John Killinger has helped me see why and shown me a truly spiritual Christainity, the kind for which I hunger. If you are dissatisfied with your faith as it presently exists, this book will be an eye opener. If you are on the defensive and threatened by anything new, you will not like it. I, for one, recommend it highly for every sincere spiritual Christian who is dissatisfied with conservative fundamentalism and is spiritually hungry for the true meaning of Christian faith. Dr. Killinger really puts things in perspective in this book, quite courageously, I might add.Thank you John Killinger."
3,Baptist gone liberal,"The author writes well of his journey from a non-religious family and rigid church upbringing to an appreciation of the nuances which were actually in the Bible in the first place. Unfortunately, he still tends to view most church experiences in extremes; everything and everyone are either all good or all bad. His ideas are safe and threadbare. His style is easy to read but sloppy. The author is very self-centered in his presentation. He appears more of an ""Anti-Baptist"" than a Christian. He had enough ideas for 20 or so pages, and then the book got really predictable and boring."
5,Ahhh!,This is one of those albums you listen to over and over. It has a permanent slot on my iPod and is constantly on my playlists. Tommy Geurrero has incredible style to match his chops. This is laid-back at its best. Intellectually engaging and head-boppingly good. Skater turned music phenomenon! Great stuff!
1,Not what I ordered,I ordered this Sparky flag from SportsMagick. It was easy to order and was shipped promptly. I received it within two days. The item shipped was NOT the item I ordered. The item showed up and it was an ASU sun flag with Arizona State University written on it. It was a one sided flag. I will not order from SportsMagick again. How can you ship something that looks nothing like the representation on the web site?
2,I've had some problems,"I really like the design of this watch. It is a simple GMT watch at a good price. But I have had some problems with the watch loosing time. I sent it to Wenger, and the movement and battery was replaced, but then it got water in it next time I went swimmnig. I'm disappointed by these problems. I wonder if there are other problems since this model is now listed in the ""outlet"" section on the Wenger website."
4,This song is awesome!,"Very few songs out there can provoke a natural euphoria, but this single is one of them. The remixes are great, especially the first track. This song is not your typical trance song, even though it does have the peaks and valleys we all love. Its something different, and definitely something you'll hear at a club."
4,A Good Book,"I enjoyed this boook as a whole. It kept me instested. There were 3 story lines. 1. Mysterious ""asidents"" are happening to Seven of Nine. 2. A sociaty without warp is trying to escape there solar system because thier sintists said the plant was going to blow up.(It did) And thier two suns were going to colide and anything within the solar will decompress or blow up ect... They have been taveling 8 years? or so and are not on thier own going to make it. Voyager is trying to help. 3. A meterorite hit the conony ship and the section cannot handel the damage and wounded like it sould be able to. A mother tries to save her childs life. The thrid story line didn't seem to fit in although it was well writen and gave the reader an insite into the colony ship. In all the book is hard to put down."
2,Don't bother-very weak story,"Luckily each of the books in the Section 31 series from Pocket Books stands on its own. ""Shadow"" is the one I wished I had passed on. I thought the story was very weak. The other Section 31 novels drew me right in and were very compelling, ""Shadow"" however did not.Someone is trying to kill Seven.... That made me the plot very uninteresting. Add in the subplot of Voyager trying to assist an alien vessel and you get two week storylines that never really work.The characterizations weren't particularly well done either. I can't think of a single reason to recommend this book to any reader, star trek fan or not."
4,Interesting Voyager Novel,"Star Trek Voyager was a great television series, with the most memorable characters since The Next Generation series. The novelization of Voyager provides entertainment for grateful Voyager/Star Trek fans. Section 31 is the second Voyager novel I have read.The story is about Seven and how someone or something is trying to kill her. As she and Janeway try to get to the bottom of this, the second plot involves a planet-sized, Noah's Ark-type ship full of a race called Rhawns. The Rhawns are trying to escape the collision of their suns and save their race and their people. Janeway has to help these people, but trust and science issues get in the way - and time is ticking away.The first three-quarters of the book is immensely intriguing, but the final quarter does not finish all the storylines, or tie them together neatly. I felt some interesting characters were just cut off. Nevertheless, this is a worthy effort that is mainly true to the characters and the show."
5,its suspensful and will keep you reading for hours,this book is very cool! all i can say is that it will keep you reading! a foreign space ship the size of delaware and millions of people at risk is in trouble because an asteroid hit it. will voyager save them? and how will the do it when its thousands of times bigger. meanwhile 7 of 9 is trying to be killed by a secret attacker. but how do you stop him when you cant see him or have any record of him being on the ship or issuing an attack on seven? buy it and find out. i promise you wont be disappointed!
2,Cheap cop-out.,"It's just a cheap cop-out when the ""villain"" of the piece, the Section 31 operative, has been dead since before the story begins, and the plot involves nothing more than the crew having to thwart her programming of the ship's computer, thus averting having to deal with what, exactly, Janeway would have done with her if she was still alive when she was exposed.Other than that, the plot is at least mediocre, maybe a tad better, and the characters are handled reasonably well. Further, the writing is technically adequate, but overall, there's nothing here good enough to even begin to offset the cheap initial concept."
5,Pretty good Star Trek book.,I started reading this book and thought it would be just another Voyager book thats part of some new mini series. As I read the story gets better and the pace picked up. But basically the story is like this; Voyager finds two stars about to collide and go supernova. Then on sensors they pick up a huge pre-warp ship trying to get out of the system before the stars blow. Captain Janeway decides like all other captains to toss out the prime directive and save the ship because they know it will be destroyed when the stars go because it is to close. Voyager comes to save the day but they have a little trouble when some weird accidents start happening to 7 of 9. I will let you read the rest and find out what happens.
3,Best Volume of the Quartet,"This concluding volume to the Star Trek Section 31 quartet of novels was the best in the series. I can't be truly objective, as in many ways, Voyager is my favorite focus in the Star Trek universe. I enjoyed the subject matter of the story, and I love these characters. One small criticism would be that I hoped Seven of Nine might demonstrate more of the special skills she has because of her Borg heritage. This short book reminded me of all that I miss about this old television show.Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel ""To Be Chosen"""
5,good buy,I would have to say that i really enjoy this series i just need to get vol 3 and vol4 and arehoping that someone one sells them for a cheaper price everywhere i looked they wanted like$99.00 the shipping process to this move was excellent as well i got it very fast and it was in excellent condition
1,Don't waste your money,"Mine officially broke last night much to my dismay! My husband got this for me about a year ago and I would occasionally use it, maybe a few times a month no problems. I started using it more often a few months ago, and it would shut off after a short amount of time. Well last night it shut off and when I finally went to use it again, it is broken!!!! One side of the massager doesn't move, like it broke it's connection to the shaker mechanism... (don't know the tech term) We have not used this massager enough to warrant it breaking like this!!!!!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY"
3,Max Massager,"The massager wasn't as nice as I thought. It was bulkier, and heavier than I anticipated. The quality of the item was less than perfect. Luckily, I was able to return the item with absolutely no hassle."
2,Definitely not native speakers,"The male speaker is passable, but the ""native"" female speaker is absolutely atrocious. All of my japanese friends have deemed her a fraud. She speaks with a weird accent that seems to be chinese in origin. I wouldn't be surprised if she's a native chinese speaker.Unfortunately, this ""native"" speaker is the female voice for Pimsleur Japanese II and III. So much for truth in advertising.While she is absolutely grating to the ears, I still find Pimsleur Japanese useful. Luckily, I received Japanese II and III as gifts. I would feel cheated if I had paid."
2,Clunking squeaky junk,"First of all the term HEPA in its pure sense is a misnomer for electrostatic filters. . The squirrel cage blower is of the absolute cheapest plastic construction with very loose tolerances.It rattles, squeaks, and generally does the hula while moving the air through the filter. It is going into the garbage."
1,It sucks...,"Not a real hepa filter, plenty of dust gets by. It stoped moving 2 months after I started using it. Not worth the money. Get a real hepa filter."
1,Loud Rattle Noises After 2 Months - Unacceptable,"I bought this due to price and design - and brand: honeywell sounds good. I read people complaining about the noise, but when I got it I felt it was an acceptable level of noise.I had this unit running for two months now, and suddenly the noise became intolerable. The way I can describe it is as a vibrating rattle as if the enclosure holding the fan motor was coming apart.I am past my return period by a few days and would have got stuck with out of pocket shipping fees + 15% restocking according to return policy.To make matters worse, I took it apart to clean it and was not impressed with the little amount of ""dust and gunk"" that came out of it. Don't expect this thing to filter out as many pollutants as are claimed on the video! It's just a fancy fan."
2,ok air purifier,I think it works because there is lots of dust particals on the machine and on the filter.It moves the air thru the machine and that can be a little cold in the winter time.I was hoping it would help with cooking smells and make the room smell fresh but it doesn't.It can also be a little loud.I think I just bought a very expensive room fan...
2,"Not bad, but noisy","Works well, easy to operate.But started an annoying squeaking sound when swiveling, so usually only turn that mode on overnight.August 2012 update: had this unit since May 2011, had just cleaned filters- and the darned thing just quit! Won't turn on, is now just a giant door stop. Bah! And Kaz (manufacturer) offers a 5-year guarantee in which I would have to pay shipping both ways to get it repaired. Not gonna happen.Lowering rating to two stars because of the noise and the short life for a unit costing well over a hundred dollars.."
2,Honeywell HFD-120-Q Tower Quiet Air Purifier,"After reading reviews I felt like this was the product for me. I have sinus problems and thought this would help. I was very disappointed. Honestly, I can't tell that it has done anything. If it weren't for the popping noise that it makes when rotating, I wouldn't even know it was here. No difference in the air or my sinus problems. Very disappointed."
3,Thankful we found this...,"We are thankful we found this after our Sharper Image air purifier went out. No, it is not HEPA, as advertised, but it is helpful. There is more noise than with the Sharper Image, but more quiet than most air cleaner. We are pleased, over all."
4,"Effective, but certainly not quite...","This air purifier is very effective at capturing indoor allergens. Since I started using it, I sometimes forget that I have allergies until I step outside. In addition to being effective, I love that the filter is permanent ( I haven't needed to clean mine yet so I can't comment on that). I gave it 4 stars because it is not nearly as quite as advertised. Personally, I like white noise and so I am able to deal with it. But I must say that it's not always pleasant when white noise come from unexpected places."
4,my personal observation,"I recvd this product promptly, anxious I set up immediately, product had odd electrical type smell to it for almost a week, running for 24/7. After that smell went away, the product works GREAT and I am pleased. Cleaning is a breeze ( I use my air compressor ) Have owned several air purifiers in the past and this one seems to work BEST. The reason I purchased is for pet dander and it does work."
2,Started making ticking sound after 4 days,At first I thought this was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Then 4 days go by and it starts to make a ticking sound. I found online the HFD-110 model has the same issue. Apparently if you take it apart and clean a few parts the clicking will stop for a short period of time :-). I took the filter out and it doesn't seem to have collected much dust.After 4 days I'm not taking this thing apart like someone suggested here:http://www.fixya.com/support/p539850-honeywell_quietclean_hfd_110_air_purifieInstead I'll be sending it back. It's a shame because it really was quiet and I had high hopes for it. Maybe I just got a bad model.
4,Meets most of my expecations,"Great product. I used it to get rid of the smell of fire smoke in my house and it did and excellent job. A bit noisy when set to high level, but not a big deal."
2,Worked great at first....,In terms of the effectiveness of actually cleaning the air it's very effective as long as it moves back and forth. I've done some air quality testing and it seems far more effective when the unit oscillates versus when it's pointed in one direction. The unit worked great at first but after a few months of use it makes an annoying clicking noise as it oscillates. Sounds like it gets caught on something every time it moves back and forth. I've tried taking it apart and lubricating the oscillating parts but still makes the clicking noise. I would not buy again.
1,well made...BUT,"the unit is well made, relatively quiet...BUT...we live near Yosemite where the air is fresh and clean. The issue for us is pollen and allergies. When I came in the house from the fresh air outside, there was a horrible smell from the machine. It was like ozone or some chemical smell. I guess from the ionizer. That night my wife had burning eyes and nausea. I have never been bothered by allergies but by morning, after running the unit all night in the bedroom, i had a bad, deep and raspy chest cough.we feel we gave it a long enough run and test. And feel concerned about these issues.My wife yet has her allergies, but they are vastly reduced after a rain, not so with the machine...it seems to do nothing in her allergy reduction.So we will look to return the unit, and hope no damage to our heath has been done. My question is what exactly is the ionizer, is it something as in sharper image machines, with their negative reviews?"
4,No more medications!,"After doing lots of research, I decided to buy the Honeywell HFD-120 HEPA Air Purifier.I like that it's tall and thin as it's easy to put in the corner of the room. I also like the fact that it oscillates and doesn't just blow air in one area.I have to clean it out about every 2 weeks but I do have 2 dogs that are often in that room. Cleaning requires a quick vacuuming and a rinse of the pad. It takes no more than 5 minutes.It's a bit loud, but I keep it on the highest setting durning the day and the on the lowest at night. I am a light sleeper but on the lowest setting it's not that loud.The permanent filter is nice since filters can be so expensive!After about a week, I wasn't waking up in the morning with allergy symptoms. For that fact alone, I am satisfied with it since I no longer depend on medication to feel good."
1,Glad you asked.,"I was disappointed in this product and sent it back. It was advertised as HEPA but in fact does not have a true HEPA filter. Rather it has a ""HEPA like"" filter. Think you should change the misleading title of the machine. In going to the Honeywell site, I found that they do not title it the way Amazon does. dee gray"
3,Maybe for summer.,"I don't much care for this purifier. Maybe I will like it better in the summer, It really does blow cold air. My light has never come on, Although I have completely cleaned it twice in 3 weeks. not much stuff in it. The Filters are clean. Husband snores less,when I used in bedroom, but I had trouble with the so called white noise? I found it rather loud. I don't know if it was worth the money, I'll maybe like it better this summer."
2,Waste of Money.,I have had many air purifier's and filters and find this one to be a complete waste. Your better off spending a little more and getting one that actually purifies the air. this is literally a fan with a foam filter in it. It has horrible suction on the back and just pushes air arround.
3,Does the job BUT!!,Great Product Honeywell this unit does the job but its too loud feels like your sitting close to an 1940 car engine!!!
5,Works great as of right now,"Haven't had any problems yet, but will update if I do. Cleaning looks simple but haven't tried it so far."
4,"A little bulky, but good overall","I recently purchased this air purifier for my basement, and must say that it works well, especially with the oscillating feature. This unit can be an adjustment for those of of who've owned an Ionic Breeze in the past, as this unit has some mild noise with its operation. While this is minor, it can take some getting used to. Also, this unit is a tad bulkier than the standard Ionic Breeze units out there. Overall, it's the performance that counts the most, and so far it's delivering fresher, cleaner air throughout my recreation room in the basement. The cleaning of the filters is easy, and not time-consuming. I recommend this product for those who want a few more features to their air purifiers."
5,Awesome for the price!,Well i my opion i believe is really good for the price and some tests have reviewed this item as VERY good. i got this thru amazon cause they have it the cheapest and free shipping so thast good! it makes some noise but is good enough to sleep with. concerning the really micro dust that may go thru because they have no positive or negative charge well get a uv light in your ac and that will do it!this item is not for big areas!works great in room around 14*20.
2,average while it lasted,"Product worked well for 4 months, then suddenly failed to power on. Product shows no sign of life whatsoever- extended service is through a 3rd party vendor, so I am guessing that repairs or service will be hard to acquire.Summarized:-product produced cleaner air than no filter at all, yet air quality seemed inferior to other true HEPA filters-clean air produced by filter had a consistent faint metallic smell-product was quiet, providing great white noise at night-oscillations were fluent and gentle-brief product lifespan severely limits quality- I simply cannot recommend this product"
4,I can breathe!,"I've had this air purifier for 5 days so far, and I can already feel the difference in how clearly I'm breathing. I can actually breath through both nostrils, something I haven't been able to do for months due to dust and pet hair allergies. Another nice perk is that we don't have to dust the apartment as often, we usually dust every 2 days or so, and so far, I've seen no need."
3,Air purifier with IFD filter,"I ordered this unit last month and was surprisingly pleased at first because of the rotating fan feature, but after a couple weeks I didn't see much difference in the dust level( I live in San Diego area). I then started reading the more negative reviews and decided to return it; I figured $152.00 was a bit expensive for a rotating fan that might have serious problems within the first year. However, what really angered me was that I had to pay $52.00 to return this item. So, if you think you might send this unit back, think twice."
3,It's alright,"I like having this in my home. This is currently in my bedroom and considering getting one for the living-room. I can tell a difference in the dust and pet dander in the air and dust on my furniture. I am updating my information: I use it every day and within a few months it stopped rotating, it makes a clicking noise and keeps me awake."
2,Super noisy-low quality,"Length:: 0:21 MinsI heard this noisy sound 2 weeks after I bought it.Since I was busy that month, I missed the return period.I recently want to repair it my self, so I opened it.The result is I cannot do it my self: the sound comes from the motor, and the fan tube is not round'It's so frustrating."
1,NOT Quiet!,I received this unit with hopes of helping keep my Mancave in clean air. The first unit was noisy so it was returned for a second unit. The second unit was even louder than the first! Now a refund is the only recourse. I think Honeywell has some homework to do with the fans on these models since the noise originates there. Now back to hunting for something q-u-i-e-t.
2,Unreliable quality,"I own two of these units and the quality is hit or miss. The first one I bought runs fairly quietly and assembles/disassebles easily for cleaning. The second unit has a very noisy fan that sounds like it is out of balance and rubbing, the filters won't stay in position and the back panel has to be taped on to keep it from falling off. While the pre-filter seems to pick up a lot of dust I can't vouch for the two interior filters. If they filter out anything it certainly isn't much. Not worth the cost in my opinion."
2,Not good on dust,"I did a lot of homework before purchasing this product. I read glowing reviews on the this website, that convinced me to make the purchase. After having the air purifier for 2 months I can say with out a doubt, that it does a poor job filtering dirt and dust. My wife still has to dust on a regular basis, and our ceiling fan seems to gather more dust than this Purifier. The noise isn't too bad, and the air seems a little bit cleaner, but this purfier falls well short of my expectations."
1,very short review,Don't have much time to review. I took a gamble on this one and lost.This product isn't worth your money.On the very basic level it doesn't trap fine particles.Just a Chinese company buying up a US brand (Honewywell) and not delivering.
1,i regret!,"this air cleaner sucks! i just got this yesterday i thought this is quite and when i turn it on its like a fan, this is good for summer but for winter i dont like to use this."
4,Honeywell Air Purifier HFD 120 Q,Works very well - however it is not as quiet as advertised - it makes a constant thumping sound when in the fixed position. It HAS helped my allergies to improve. My lady friend has noticed an improvement as well. It is easy to set up and maintain.
3,Honeywell HFD-120,"The tower is well built, and the amount of air that it moves is very good, even for large rooms. It's also very quiet. But to be honest, I haven't noticed any difference in air quality, and neither has my roommate."
1,Save your money and please don't buy this,"I have been using this unit for around a year. This ""air purifier"" is actually an overpriced fan. The IDF filter is totally useless as it does not collect anything. The pre-filter collects some large dust over time, but the two IDF filter, the heart of this unit, is either broken or comepletely fake. They do NOT collect anything and they are as clean as new. Small dust particles bypass the unit and collects on the fan. Additionally, the unit makes annoying squeaking sound when oscillating, and the pre-filter warps over time. What a joke, stay away!"
1,Not pleased,"Bought this air cleaner sometime back and it quit oscillating shortly after purchase, then began to be so noisy, we couldn't use it. I sent it back under warranty and they did replace it and the second one has done the same thing."
2,Strange Smell Continues,"I know this had been said many times but I wanted to add one more testimony to the list. I have been running it for two weeks and it still smells like ozone. Maybe it is slightly better. Hopefully it is not dangerous. If anything, the smell is just plain annoying. I am giving it two stars because it is very quiet."
3,doesn't work for rooms with oil oders,"i just put in a new buderus 90% efficiency burner and ever since then, the stench of oil is stronger in my oil burner closet. i bought this to see if it would remove the oily oder from my oil burner closet and it doesn't work. based on the feedback/reviews, i thought it would as the room is very small."
3,its only ok..... read my review short and simple,the product is only ok for the price.after about 3 months of 24/7 rotating the machine starts to make a squeaky noise. took it apart and there is a lot of plastic shavings....this isn't a real hepa filter....the black mesh filter in the back is what catches dust and is probably the only thing catching anything. the comb filters on the inside catching particles is negligible. i do sit it in a bath of water it does turn very light gray but it doesn't seem to catch much.the fan is strong but that pretty much all it is. my room still gets very dusty.... my room is average size and the door is always closed. (live in a college house) the carpets are nice and clean and i use a great vacuum cleaner and i dust with a swiffer regularly.
4,Would recommend to people,"I bought this about a month ago and couldn't wait to clean it to see how much dust is in our house. Well, finally couldn't wait and tore the filters out of it and cleaned them. Wow, quite a difference. The day I plugged it in, I did all my dusting around the furniture and I have to say, I haven't had to dust furniture since I started it up. We have a gravel driveway and dust is a problem, but I think I've found a solution. This is also allergy season for me here in April/May, and although I don't see a significant change in my normal congestion, I'm hoping it will only improve with time. This is a good product and it does what it's advertised to do."
4,It works!,"I just moved from New Mexico to Austin. I have been in Austin for one year and this is the worse place to live when you get allergies because the Cedar is really bad. My boyfriend was really sick from Cedar Fever and once I got this in the mail, he started to feel better right away. I still get slight allergies but not as bad. I have this thing running 24/7 in a 809 sq ft apartment. It's certified for only about 108 sq ft I think but still works for the entire apartment! I am impressed. I could've purchased a $500 purifier that works for 800 sq ft home but I can't afford it so yeah it is worth the money... works very well."
2,still not sure...,"i bought this a little over 6 months ago and despite reading all the reviews of it making awful noises, decided to be stubborn and get it anyway. i cant have it oscillate anymore because it makes this horrid screeching noise now. and, last night it started rattling really bad. i dont know if a fan has gotten knocked loose or what, but i have to keep it on the low setting so i cant hear it. :-/it was great, until these problems started. considering that i paid over 200 (from a retail outlet) for this item, i expected it to work a little longer than 6 months."
4,It works!,"This purifier actually works. I noticed the difference of the air quality in my apartment within the first few hours of plugging it in. I was initially hesitant about spending so much money on it, but after cleaning it for the first time I noticed all the dirt and dust coming off the filters that would otherwise be on my furniture or in my lungs. (To clean, I shake out the foamy outer filter outdoors and run the IFD filters under the shower spray for a few minutes.) The manual says to clean the filters once a month (there's even a timer based on the hours it has been running), but you can actually tell when it needs it by looking at the back of the machine.The oscillator is great, the fan is good (though I wouldn't count on it replacing a normal fan in the summertime even though it's strong), and the white noise is also a bonus for all of you who like pleasant white noise while sleeping."
4,Works well,"Live in an apartment with smoker underneath us. Got the fan to help with stale smoke smell. The fan is very quiet, air smells cleaner and I don't notice the smoke smell as much when it is running. My apt. is 1350 sq. ft and I only have one fan which covers approx. 200 sq. ft. so i'm sure if i had more fans it would be even better. i just got the one fan for the living room which was the worst room and it seems to be helping. i would recommend it."
2,Just a fan,Not really effective. I used this in a very dusty basement and the filters never picked up anything. After about a month it became very loud.
2,"These air purifiers ran in some very dirty air,and arrived dirty.","The first thing I did after it arrived was to inspect the filters. The pre filter was clean but the insides, ionizers, and fans were filthy. They were coated with a very dark coloured dirt. Nothing like I've ever seen come out of my other air purifiers at home. They come our white from the dust they trap. One was also scratched up on the side. They did seem to run though. I'll give them to a friend that's a mechanic to use in his shop. A perfect place for them as they don't deserve to be placed in a home as dirty as the insides are from the ruff life they've been threw."
3,"Works great, oscillation stopped working!!!!","When I got this I loved it! It's almost like a really quiet fan, and cleans the air amazingly. I use it in my bedroom which isn't very big, and it's perfect. The permanent filters were the main reason I went with this, they're easy to clean. My one issue... the oscillation feature stopped working. I've read other reviews here where that happened as well. I don't know what happened but it just started clicking when trying to turn and won't go past that point. This REALLY REALLY annoys me as one of the reasons I got it was for this feature. Now I just have it sitting there, not turning. Of course this happened after I could send it back, so now I'm stuck. I've tried to get it to work to no avail. So bottom line, as a purifier, it's great. If you really want the oscillation feature, might wanna look somewhere else because this will probably break on you eventually."
3,Red indicator light never came on,"I was quite busy when I bought this, so I only glanced at the user manual. I saw that it said a red indicator will tell me when I need to clean the filters. Two years went by and the indicator never came on. I finally noticed degraded performance. I looked inside the filters and Ew! A layer of dust had accumulated over the years. Anyway, I cleaned everything last night and today it seems to be working fine again."
1,I DONT SEE ANY DIFFERENCE WITH THIS AIR PURIFIER,"I clearly have dust and pet hair in my home. I bought this with the hope that it will help clean the air in my home. I read the reviews and they were mostly positive - so I bought it. I have had this thing on the highest setting in the middle of my room for about one week now (and I mean I have had it ON non-stop.) I recently opened the back to see how dirty the filter would be, as proof that it is working well by catching/filtering dust from my room. THERE WAS NOTHING THERE! it looked as clean as it did the day I opened it from the box! There are clear signs of dust and pet hair build-up all over my room. It is an over priced, nice looking, and quiet functioning fan if anything. Certainly NOT an ""AIR PURIFIER."" I recommend you keep looking and find something else. I will be returning mine."
2,Worked well for the first year or so....,"When I first bought this air purifier, towards the end of 2009, it was absolutely amazing. It was extremely quiet and really made the air in my room crisp and fresh. Although it still appears to be cleaning the air, the noise has become just intolerable. It is not just a heavy circulation noise that you hear with some fans and or space heaters - it sounds like the whole electronic mechanism is just straining to make it work. And I'm really at a loss at to why this happened, as I've been extremely gentle with it and have kept the filters very clean. Unfortunately, since I refuse to spend another $200 on a new air purifier at this time, I will continue using it until the end of 2011. Just wanted to post this as a warning to buyers out there that this air purifier might age a bit quicker than you would like."
5,AMAZING!,The light just came on not too long ago to clean the filter and I was amazed by what was captured! The room smells clean all of the time and there is no dog smell! The fan blows hard on maximum and cools me down on a hot summer day! Great Great!
4,So far so good,Using in the bedroom. Makes air smell fresh. Haven't used it long enough to clean so not sure how easy that is. Best part is not having to buy replacement filters.
2,Not the best,I bought this back in April and worked great for the first couple weeks know its a lot noisier any annoying. Im calling the manufacture to hopefully get a new replacement.
1,emits ozone,"I do not own this product, but I refuse to buy it because it emits ozone from the ionizer, which can potentially be dangerous for your health overtime.Buy an air purifier that doesn't emit ozone. If you want a Honeywell, there are other purifiers under this brand-name that don't emit ozone.But, be sure to do the research yourself, don't trust these corporations.info: epa.gov/iaq/pubs/ozonegen.html"
1,DON'T BUY THIS ONE,"We have three highly allergic children in our house and have used the IONIC breeze for the last ten yrs. It was great!! Easy cleaning,no sound(unless it needed to be wiped out),no filters to buy,energy efficient and small. It did a great job but wanted to try something new since it had been awhile since we bought one. Bought this Honeywell and it is not qite at all. Even on low you can hear the fan. I put it on high it sounds like we have a regular fan blowing in the room!! If you want a quiet dependable no hassle air purifier get the IONIC breeze. I just ordered a new one. And I'm sure I'll be allot happier when it gets here!"
1,Died after a few weeks,"In only a few weeks, the oscillating feature stopped working. Then I unplugged it to clean the pre-filter, plugged it back in, and the power button didn't work. I bought 2 of these and had to throw them both in the dumpster after 3 months. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,breathe easy,"I purchased one and liked it so much, I got another. I use them in bedroom and home office during my allergy season in the spring. Had an old Honeywell round HEPA media type filter, which was loud and blew the dust off the floor. I noticed a big improvement in air quality. Maybe the old one needed a new filter or maybe the new one has a better filter technology. The tower configuration circulates room air smoothly without blowing everything off the floor. The squirrel cage fans in this new one are quiet and vibration free. Direction oscillation is good for cooling at night."
1,Buyers should know . . .,"Honeywell HFD-120-Q Tower HEPAQuiet Air Purifier with Permanent IFD Filter, BlackI received this unit yesterday, but didn't get to try it out. Hence, the one star rating. When I read the set-up instructions, they said the unit has to be placed 3 feet from the wall and any furniture. Placing it 3 feet from the furniture made it set almost in the middle of the room, where we would probably fall over it. I think that would be a hazard in any average size room. The instructions also said to place a small rug under the unit to keep it from staining the carpet. None of this information is included in the product description. I returned it today, but I have to pay the shipping and handling costs because Amazon doesn't consider it their fault. Maybe it's not, but if I'd known the above information, I wouldn't have ordered the product in the first place."
4,Honeywell HFD-120Q air cleaner,"We have been using the filter for about 3 weeks, pretty much constantly. It is quiet but produces some useful white noise. I am surprised the filter element hasn't needed cleaning yet. The unit has a reasonably small footprint, so it's fairly unobtrusive. Seems to be a good buy based on the results so far."
2,Okay until it broke after 14 months,"It was decent, not great. Got a lot of stuff out of the air, but didn't get rid of all the smell. It wasn't too loud but it died after 14 months. Just turned ""on"" but the fan wasn't running."
1,strong smell,We bought this room air cleaner to help with dust and allergies. after running the cleaner for a few hours the entire room had a strong chemical odor. The smell is worse than any dust. I did not expect this and after reading the reviews here I realized that is what the unit does. We are going to return it.
3,"Breezy, Cold for Cooler Temps","So, I just received the unit and planned to put it in our bedroom for us as allergy season kickstarted early this year. But, the first thing we noticed is it blows out cooler, breezy air. I'd like use this year round but it's going against our heating system. What's up with the fan and breeze of cool air? Hmm...may have to return as we can use this at night when we need it most."
4,good fan,"It is great to get air moving around my small apartment, and (by looking at the filter) seems to have removed a good amount of dust. the only thing is the inner filters are honey combed shaped, and are about 3/4 mm in diameter, and dont seem to have any purpose if the outer filter in so small it removes everything to tiny dust particles. it doest add up. my assumption is the honey comb inner filter uses electrostatics to capture particles much smaller than dust...?*~ summing up. its quiet, powerful, has three levels of power, and has a control for automatic pivot (90 degrees). i have had it on everyday for atleast 8-9 hours for just over a month and havent noticed a difference in performance yet."
5,Quiet and effective.,My wife and I are very pleased with this purifier. Extremely quiet and seems to be effective.
5,Perfect Purifer,"Excellent, quiet, small, air is visibly cleaner. A very worth while purifier for people with allergies."
2,Ecellent value,"I got this with a bit of skepticism but having used the product for a number of months now, I can say that it has removed it's fair share of air borne particles. While this is not something you should get if you want really complete filtering, it is perfect for those who want measurable improvement in the air. Its washable filters are just one of many convenient features that would make it a hard deal to pass up."
2,Worked great...for about a year.,"I really did appreciate this while it lasted. It was in my bedroom and served as a fan/white noise maker/air purifier all in one. I'd only turn it on while sleeping, but it lasted barely over a year before it started making a horrible sound. It sounds like there is a flap or rudder stuck in a fan blade or something. So, I'll be paying shipping to the manufacturer in TN, plus their $10 reshipping fee. Not what I expected from this price point and the frequency in which it was used."
4,good choice ~,"If you are looking for a decent air purifier with permanent filter(s), I would highly recommand this product. I've purchase 3 units and had to return one due to weird fan noise, but all units are working fine now. I would be bit concerned for the winter time use, since it does create bit of draft even at the lower fan-speed setting. I had the units running for 1 month now and air quality in each room got better. I do have seasonal allergies so it did help a bit not a big help."
4,"First one noisy, second one great",This air purifier is great. I so like the ability to clean the filters with just water. The first one we got was a bit noisy and seemed to be the motor rattling a bit. We requested a replacement and Amazon sent one out that day and the new one arrived the next day. I boxed up the old one and dropped it at UPS. So far this one is working well and quietly.
3,Nice but annoying clicking sound,"The purifier works pretty well. My bedroom doesn't smell like dogs any more :-) However, when I have it on the oscillator setting, it makes an annoying clicking sound as it goes back and forth. It is impossible to sleep with this click..click...click through the night, so I have to keep it stationary, which seems kind of like I paid for a function I can't use. However, it does look nice and sleek if you are concerned about appearance."
4,Good air purifier,"I have an apartment full of pets and I am very allergic to cats. So with 2 cats, a dog and fish in a small apartment, I really was having issues with sleeping at night. I can't say when I first got the purifier, that it was the most amazing thing in the world. I can say that I leave it on at night and I do wake up and feel 10 times better when I wake up in the morning. Not to say, that it has completely controlled my allergies, but I do place it wherever I am in the house so that they are controlled to an extent. I would recommend it because it has helped with some nights that were sleepless. I haven't cleaned it yet, but I have taken it apart and it seems like it should be a breeze to clean once it comes time. Also it is very quiet and it has an almost ambient sound for when your sleeping. I also will have the tv on from time to time, and it does not block the volume out on that as well."
1,JUNK,"Purchased this product on April 12, 2011 and it lasted not even 3 months. Operated the unit in a 10 X 10 room for approximately 5 hours per day until it burned out-can not be repaired-total loss."
4,Love it,"I love this air purifier, bought for the office, and it makes a significant difference. The air seemed dead in there, with the purifier, you notice the difference when you walk in the room. It also keeps the room cooler."
4,Nice Oscillating Function if you like Ozone,"I had the large Idyllis with carbon filter and it did not even work in combination with open windows so I replaced it with this Honeywell, which is moderately effective on pungent food/smoke smells but only on the highest/oscillating setting. I do not see much improvement on cat dander. The small non-oscillating Honeywell (near my laptop) is only mildly effective if you sit near it but it is also serves to slightly cool my laptop. There is a lot of negative energy (pun intended) surrounding Ozone emissions but this is the only unit that works in my smelly home. I also have the Ionic Pro Turbo but it does not seem as effective as the Honeywell even on the highest setting; yet it emits less ozone."
4,"Fantastic! Quiet, reduces pet, cooking and other odors!","This is our first air purifier and we couldn't be more happy! This product does all it says and more. We got the purifier to help with allergies and dust. I used to walk into the house and smell dog odor even after they were groomed- now, I don't notice any odor when I walk in. It has reduced cooking odors as well. Quiet and emits a small amount of cool air.So happy with our purchase - worth every penny!"
5,BEWARE,"Don't use this product if you can't handle looking 10 years younger within seconds of using it! Seriously, when you get yours, just do one eye and watch in a magnifying mirror and see the immediate difference! Soon as you see the awesome difference, you won't be able to resist hurrying to get it on the other eye. It's all handmade right here in the U.S.A. too! Don't see much of that anymore."
2,Can't stand the smell,"The product gets good ratings for lack of toxicity and the packaging is nice, but it smells so bad I don't know if I can use it. It smells like really strong insect repellent to me, absolutely awful. I can tolerate that if I have to but don't want to smell that way to others. I'm trying to find organic products that also smell good and this is coming off my list."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"This is also called Beowulf's Children, and deals with what happens to a future generation on the planet Heorot. They have some knowledge of what goes on around the planet now, of course, but they still have to deal with it, and keep trying to forge ahead and create a civilisation. Not as interesting as the first book."
5,Top notch memoir of a dancer turned bomber pilot,"I am grateful for Mr. Zellmer's detailed memoir of his life as a bomber pilot in the South Pacific. Although my own father served in the Army Air Corps fighting the Japanese, he never shared his frightening experiences with our family. This books allows the reader an opportunity to know the sights, the beauty, the fears, the excitement and the boredom of war in tropical lands. In addition to allowing us inside the cockpit during his first flights and later his bombing missions, Zellmer gives the reader a front row seat into the world he came from, the on stage world of Martha Graham's Dance Company. It's apparent that the author spent long years researching the era, as well as putting together his combat experience from letters written home to family and friends. I found this both a compelling and an informative read."
4,Big Boy Pete - 'London American Boy' (Raucous Records),"Didn't realize it at first, but judging by this CD's front cover, this particular Big Boy Pete title is a collection of the musician's tribute to '50's rock. Very well-done - I might add. Tunes that show just how diverse this UK veteran can get are the true '50's rockabilly ""That's The Way I Feel"", ""Hang Up My Rock & Roll Shoes"", the catchy ""Ballad Of A Teenage Queen"", his Willie Dixon cover ""My Babe"", the country-rock swinging ""I Ain't Givin' Up Nothin'"" and the early 1950's Leadbelly ditty ""Goodnight Irene"". Not only is 'London American Boy' very entertaining, I thought - it certainly showcases another side of Big Boy Pete that a lot of his (already existing) fans may have not been aware of. Overall, a fine piece."
3,So far okay.,"I'm just about 1/3 of the way through, and so far it's okay. Several of the stories are a little too much of a big ball of art for my taste (I like my horror in your face; don't really care for thought-provoking metaphor or mind-expanding symbolism, but it's still pretty good. I was looking for horror fiction (my favorite) with gay characters or some sort of gay focus; something that would speak to me. I'll review again once I'm finished, and I'll review the second book once I start. I would recommend it if horror is your thing, and you want to see some openly gay folks as main characters. It's not bad at all (so far)."
3,"Disappointing, but not a total loss","What disappointed me the most about Queer Fear was that the editor seems to think that ""gay"" and ""queer"" should mean ""gay male."" All but one of these stories are about men, and most are of the carelessly-written sort that one expects to find in anthologies of ""gay fiction."" There's very little that's frightening (or even interesting) here, more a preoccupation with sex than writing good stories. However, Caitlin Kiernan's ""Spindleshanks,"" the ONLY story in the book about lesbians, is, curiously, also the only story in Queer Fear that transcends the pulply, hackneyed tone of the anthology to deliver something of literary merit. I would have given the book one star, but Kiernan's lush prose and skillful characterization are worth a couple more."
4,great beach read,"okay, so as if being gay in George Dubya's America isn't scary enough, these stories - which veer away from politics completely - will keep you turning pages all the way. While the prose can get pretty purple sometimes, the tales are quirky and dark, with lots of gore, scares and even some humor scattered throughout. A previous reviewer wrote that one of the book's flaws is that ""faeries"" don't possess people - uh, get a life, dude....it's all makebelieve anyway, and these are almost all great fun and an excellent way to kill a couple hours on the beach."
2,A Weak Effort Of A Box Set By Any Standard,"Being a fan of pre-war old-time music and post-war field sessions by Lomax and other, I thought that this box, even though pricey, would certainly be worth it. I was, unfortunately, wrong. Though there are some mighty good tracks to be had with this set, it really could be boiled down to one or possibly two discs. Most of the material is tepid and folky and very affected sounding, completely unlike the pre-war material and and authentic field-sessions. Some of the guitar performances by Blind Thomas (Fahey) and B. Sam Firk (Stewart) are inspired but those with vocals by them are downright awful. Plus, adding to the unnecessary cost is the hard-to-read notes and the mysterious bottle-opener..."
2,Cute -- but the packaging is better than the music,"A lot of the performances are horrid, some of the arrangements are insipid. There ended up being about 30 tunes and songs here that were of interest--and over 100 that I'll never listen to again. In many ways, it's a beautifully packaged vanity project of limited interest musically."
3,Reading with Tequila,"The Alpine Christmas is the third book in the Emma Lord Mystery series, but the first one that I have read. The characters were interesting and the storyline mildly thrilling. The story flowed well, not too slow, but not frantically fast paced either. The murder mystery left me guessing, which is always a huge bonus. Everything about The Alpine Christmas was just right, but the book felt tired. It wasn't dull, but it didn't leave me wanting more, which is the key to any series book. I'm going to give the Emma Lord Mystery series another try in the hopes that the indifference I feel is more book based than series based."
4,"Save money, Almost as good as Peets","I was looking for small ways to save a buck and we found this coffee. tastes great, nice oily beans for a bold coffee. you get maybe 3 times as many beans but a few dollars more than you would for peets at the grocery store. use subscribe and save feature for a %15 discount.try it out."
2,Not so great...,"I really don't like this coffee. I don't know if this is true of all French Roasts and if that is something that others who like French Roast like, but this coffee tastes burnt to me. It even looks and smells burnt. The beans are black. I have had much better coffee and my husband calls me a coffee snob."
5,Great Coffee,"This is really a great cup of coffee. I've been searching for coffee like this for a while now. The coffee available at our local grocer is very typical. Expensive, corporate and definitely not as fresh. I use a stove-top percolator and the coffee smooth and rich."
2,Insulting to Intelligence,"The great quality and flavor of these beans is negated by the claim of ""Biodynamic"" growing methods. ""Biodynamics"" is a theory that holistic agriculture using homeopathy, shamanism, and astrology will harmonize nature to produce superior products. No plausibility, no evidence, just unjustifiable claims. Sell me delicious coffee, but leave out the nonsense!"
4,Good all around coffee,"Very good taste, not bitter. I like a rich dark strong cup of coffee in the morning and this suits the bill. I am also going to try more of their dark roast coffee. Will let you know what I think as I try them."
5,Excellent Coffee at a Great Price!,"This is a rich, full-bodied coffee. I drink at least a pot a day and I have yet to get a nasty acid kick-back. I am going to try some other varieties of this brand, but will always keep some of this on hand."
3,Average,"Good, but not outstanding, It does have a good and somewhat complex flavor, but it seems weak and thin compared to some less expensive coffee from local stores--I wouldn't buy it again unless it was a bout 30% cheaper."
1,Price is now ridiculous,"We have ordered this coffee for years on Subscribe and Save. There was a time when it was a good deal but those days are over. The price has now climbed out of the ""reasonable"" range and I will be canceling my subscribe and save on this item. It was under $20 for years now its climbed to over $26."
5,High Quality Full Bodied Coffee,"This is the only coffee I have bought for the last year. It doesn't seem to have high acidity and the taste is full bodied without over roasting the beans the way some others do (to mask that they are using low quality coffee beans). When the beans are over roasted the coffee tastes too strong, burned, and bitter. This makes an excellent high quality cup of coffee everytime. Make sure you are using purified water so that you do not introduce chemical tastes from tap water and to use the right size of grind for your method of making coffee. I use the pour over cone filter method. Enjoy!"
4,great book!,"Great book, clear and concise instructions and interesting to read of Kam Thye's journey. Essential for those studying the Lotus Palm Thai Yoga Massage."
2,Basics,"I've been practicing Thai Yoga Massage for the last two years and I thought the classic approach of Kam Chow was lacking. I felt as though the book would be great for someone completely unfamiliar with the practice but too basic to teach me anything new. As well known as Kam Chow is in the Thai Massage world, I expected a more comprehensive approach for beginning to intermediate Thai Massage bodyworkers. I found Kira Balaskas' Thai Yoga Massage: How to Use Traditional Thai Massage, Yoga, and Breathwork for Healing and Spiritual Harmony, refreshing, clear and helpful.Thai Yoga Massage: How to use Traditional Thai Massage, Yoga, and Breathwork for Healing and Spiritual Harmony"
3,This is a good book,"The book is pretty good, the cd is o.k. Most of the information in the book is not on the c.d., which was dissapointing. One this is to read it and another is to have someone show it. The book is clear and to the point, which is a plus. It's great for someone who is starting to learn about the poses and the energy lines."
5,This is the best tea ever!,I first tasted this tea in the U.K. and plan to always have it on hand at home. I love it!
3,Bruce Jones Mails It In,"The writing is the main disappointment in Hulk v. Thing Hard Knocks. There's not much excitement or tension and hardly any plot. Jae Lee's art differs from his usual atmospheric Milleresque-Sienkiwicz renderings.The art is the high point and saving grace of this work and justifies its purchase. Pretty pictures, petty plot."
5,From the best,"A book on cooking from the ""Chef of the Century"" ... what more needs to be said? The perfect gift for my master chef of a wife."
2,Very basic - nothing new,"If you're new to trying to organize your kids, this little book might be helpful. If you've ever read a home organization book of any kind, however, this one will offer nothing new. Out of the entire book, there's only one tip that I hadn't read elsewhere before."
2,Corbel,"It delated more than 2 weeks. I called the seller during the waiting time, they just told me that this item was out of stock, they were waiting for the shippment. I don't believe them, because it is not the first time happens to this seller."
5,Tango en vivo,the best music of Adriana Varela: wanderful! emotion for the soul. The rough voice of Adriana is truly magical and special!
5,Blues to Cubism,"As a starving artist in his blue period, Pablo Picasso takes in a cat from the street, named Minou. Unable to sell many of his paintings, Picasso and Minou scrounge the streets for food. In a part of Montmartre, Minou discovers a circus caravan. The acrobats and performers give him food. Minou takes food back to Picasso and leads him to the circus caravan. Picasso starts painting some of his new friends, selling the artwork, as well as some of his blue period paintings, to the owner of a gallery. With the money from the paintings, Picasso and Minou move to a larger apartment. Picasso takes off in a new direction of painting. Minou meows contentedly with his owner's growing success. This picture book story brings the life and artwork of Pablo Picasso to the child reader, ages 5-8, revealing his hardships, as well as his success."
3,you took more money from me than is the real price,I like it but the price. How can other people buy at $12 dollars and I bought it at $167 dollars?
2,CAREFUL of Fireworks,"I honestly cannot imagine why anyone, given a choice, would use Fireworks. The program is absolutely crawling with bugs. It's slow. It lacks essential tools. Even the much-touted ability to handle both vector and bitmap graphics is likely to get in your way as much as help you.To give an idea of the extent of bugs -- simple things the program can't handle -- if you copy a portion of a graphic and create a new file to drop it into, the new file will almost always be created slightly too big. Leaving you a one-or-two-pixel gap along a side.My advice is clear: stick to Photoshop. Fireworks is something to use only if you don't have the money for the real thing."
5,My mother convinced me to give it to her!,"When I showed this brush to my mother, she insisted that I give it to her. It feels sooo good on your scalp! Love it!"
5,great brush,i used to have the macadamia brush but it broke and this one is the replacement it feels great on my scalp like a massage
2,Are You Crazy!,"Are you people crazy! Who'd pay that much money for a comic book, at that price you won't ever get any buyers. I know I wouldn't pay that much."
2,not worth THAT much!,"The comics by Yumi Tsukirino are very cute and I would recommend them, but not for $300! If the seller isn't willing to part with it for a normal price (I see these books costing about $5 each!) then they shouldn't have it up for sale at all. That's ridiculous."
1,MOBILE 8,"My plan was to get a pocket size record of my customer's files to load on my Palm TX. However the FileMaker Mobile 8 only allows 50 fields to be used which rendered it useless for my purpose. Since I never loaded it, I don't know how it otherwise would have performed."
3,"The title has it right -- very, short, introduction","No book of such a short length could hope to give a full account of the history of capitalism, its defenders and its critics. For example, this book starts with an examination of european trading companies -- but surely this was not the beginning of capitalism.Regardless of any shortcomings, this book will not necessarily hurt the reader -- hopefully it will inspire more reading on this incredibly complex subject."
5,Great for parents,"I'm looking to join in with some family members to start a farm and thought it would give me a lot of great tips. It did in fact give me things to consider but it was more geared towards parents farming with their children, which was still beneficial. It was a good read. A lot of common sense stuff, which isn't so common these days, but plenty of moments that make you go ""ah ha"". Definitely worth reading."
4,garmin user,"Wonderfull training device, i have not started using the virtual trainer but can't wait to start."
3,Garmin 101,"Disappointed with the unit. It has great capabilities and the price was right, but the pace function does not work dependably, and the battery life does not appear to be the 14 hours advertised. I needed a battery operated unit so that I could use the Garmin while hiking peaks from a backpack/backcountry situation, therefore being able to replace batts and use it every day, and during the pack, to track elevation and distance, etc. I have the 201 for day hikes, which charges electrically. It could be operator error, but battery life should not be..."
3,You get what you pay for...,"This item is the lower of the Forerunner series and it shows.I wanted this item mainly for interval training and pacing. It is good for interval training and it is pretty easy to figure out the menu system. What I didn't like is the pacing information. If I went under a tree or a tunnel or anything blocking my view of the sky, the pacing would go out of whack.It does take a while for the GPS signal to synchronize when you turn it on. It's a bit heavy and feels cumbersome sometimes when running.I bought the lowest model and it shows... it does its job but at a mediocre level. If you want a more reliable training device, go with a higher model."
5,I'll never run without a Garmin again,"The Garmin is a great product. It is easy to learn (very ""intuitive"") and makes it so much easier to run new routes while keeping up with distance and pace.I ran a great time in my first 10k race thanks to my Garmin. I'm relatively new to running and therefore can't pace myself naturally. The Garmin allowed me to tell myself to slow down at times and to speed up at others."
2,This one is disappointing.,"The first time my son put it on, the band broke. That is no bueno. Enough said."
5,Garmin review,"It's nice to finally know how far each run is! Sometimes it's a bit of a bother to have to put the device out in the open prior to a run to allow it to ""find"" its bearings, but this usually takes about 2 minutes. Also, I have tended to go through the AAA batteries pretty quickly, so need to keep the device off when not in use."
1,Ripped Off!!,"When I placed the order for a used Garmin Forerunner 101 I expected to get that product even though it wasn't new. Imagine my surprise when that wasn't what I was sent. What I actually reveived was a Garmin Foretrex 101, which I have found is an obsolete item. So, here I am with basically a piece of junk and no recourse other than knowing that I'm out something over $95 for my trouble. So, I give warning to potential buyers of ""used"" merchandise. Think twice about ""saving"" money over the purchase of a new item."
4,Excellent tool for monitoring jogging progress,"The Forerunner 101 offers the ability to use replaceable AAA batteries. I use a set of NiMH rechargeable AAA batteries that last for about 1-2 weeks worth of running. The GPS takes awhile to lock onto a signal from a cold start. The longest it has taken was about 5 minutes! So I recommend going outside and stretch while the unit ""warms up"". Sometimes if I face Due West, the signal locks on faster.The Forerunner 101 does not work inside most buildings, but it does work well in a car to track your GPS speed. The mapping feature is an interesting tool, albeit crude.The Forerunner logs your mileage, calories burned, and average speeds."
5,Just as Ordered,This product was delivered in a timely manner and was just as the description had listed... Positive purchase experience.
3,Don't get this model,"I have the 201 model, and am able to re-charge the batteries. The 101 model requires separate batteries. You should know that this device eats batteries. It's better to have the 201 with the built in rechargeable battery (this gives you 11-12 hours of GPS watch time)."
2,"Great product, but only last for a few weeks.","I bought my first Forerunner 201 2 months ago. It had so many wonderful functions, I purchased 3 more immediately for our running team. After 2 weeks, one went dead. Then, one by one, three went dead. Amazon is excellent in replacing new ones. But even the replacement broke down after a few weeks. I really like the product, but now I am looking for other options - Timex Distance+time, or Nevman."
2,Garmin 101,"Well, it's a great idea, the main problem i've found with this is that it has a hard time picking up the satelite to use the GPS system, which stinks. I live right in the heart of madison, wi, so there shouldn't be a problem with this, but I find the GPS frequently loses the signal and will not calculate an accurate distance and speed. Also, if you stop during your run the device takes a long time to get back on track when you start running again. So, I really like the idea, but it's probably worth the money to get one with a better tracking system."
3,Very useful tool,"I use this device frequently to log my mileage and average speeds. I have found that I can only get about 2 weeks worth of battery life from rechargeable 750 mAh AAA batteries. It takes its sweet time locking onto GPS satellites during a cold start. I have had to wait 5 minutes in an open field and even had it flake out on me a few times, losing the signal completely. Once I even lost an entire run for no good reason.The positive aspects include good water tightness, flexible mounting (use the extension as an armband or wear it as a watch), and flexible settings. I prefer reading average speeds rather than minute paces and it allows me to do that.Another interesting use for this device is as a speedometer for a car. I have logged 60+ mph while driving and it seems to function properly. Theoretically you could check elevation and speed so it is useful on the track or dragstrip."
1,"Sold used item as ""NEW""","I paid over $200 for this item because I wanted to make sure I got a NEW watch. The order sheet says ""Brand New! - Box is Missing, Instruction Manual Included, Never Used, PERFECT! - Satisfaction Guaranteed"" The first time I turned it on I checked the history - 251 miles and 51 hours! How can this be a new watch? A Garmen cannot track satellites from inside a package! If I wanted a used watch I would have paid the lower price to get a used one."
2,a disappointment,"I was thrilled to get this gadget at first, as I find difficult to gauge how fast I'm running. However, I've had it for about four or five months now, and increasingly, I'm finding that the GPS function is not working (and no, it's not a battery problem). 80% of the time, when I'm out running, the watch face reads ""weak GPS signals,"" at which point, it stops working. This happens both when I'm running in town and in the country. I don't know if this has anything to do with where I live (Charlottesville, VA), but I'm becoming increasingly frustrated with this gadget!"
3,Too big!,"It works fine, but it's way, way, way too large! Who wants to run around with a gadget the size of a cell phone strapped on your wrist. I jog IN PUBLIC man! I just cut the band off and now I run with it in my cell phone case.If you buy it, be sure to get a cell phone case to go with it. Type this number in the amazon.com search box to get the same case I have (it's a perfect fit): B00024S92U. That product number should pull it right up."
1,1000% junk,this thing eats batteries every 4hours when it did work. now it only searches for signals and the only way to turn it off is to take out the batteries. i tried to get in contact with garmin but they dont respond. leave this thing a lone.
4,Sports Shorts Review,A reasonable price for good quality sport shorts. There's really not much sense in spending more for something to sweat in.
4,Dark Relic has finally arrived on DVD (Region2),"I originally viewed this movie on the SyFy Channel a few years ago. Lucky for me it just reaired and I was able to set the DVR. Atleast I have this on DVR until Region 1 is released. If you care for the genere then I recommend it. Its definently a ""B"" movie but its better than most attempts."
5,Best collection of her work,"Newly recorded for this CD, Gayle is in better voice than ever. Musicians backing her are so good that these familiar songs get new life. She also sings ""Always"" and ""For the Good Times"" If you only have one CD by Crystal Gayle, this is the one to own. END"
4,Amazing and troubling,"I was amazed by reading this little, choking pageturner. I am a poet, but never could write a novel. She did. I deal with modern Italian literature, she deals with ancient one. But she wrote a novel. A MODERN one.Who is Ephraim Levi, the blond-haired, fascinating dark angel she describes in the book? Maybe Achilles, or Alcibiades, or Alexander the Great? Not at all. He is a jewish piano player in Milan, Italy. Nowadays. He's sweet and terrible, languid and cruel, just like an ancient Eros. But he's awfully up-to-date.Maybe the man I would like to be. Maybe the man she actually is."
4,Bratty ska-punk at it's best,"Assorted Jellybeans are more fun than I've ever had in Riverside, CA. The bratty vocals are probably my favorite aspect of this disc. If you think you'd like the love child of Operation Ivy and The Toy Dolls, you'll like this record. The best track is Braindead. The bass player, Ricky Boyer, is an on fire fox on wheels (great bass player too)."
2,NOOO!!!!!!!!!,"Okay, first off, I'm not a kid, I just didn't want to make an account. The music on the cd is pretty cool, but there's a problem. You see, I heard AJB on Tony Hawk's Underground and I wanted one of their cds. Me, being the resposible guy that I am, (not!) decided to look up the lyrics first. (I do that before I buy cds) Well, EVERY SONG ON HERE HAS INAPPROPRIATE LYRICS!!!! They all either say bad words or talk about drugs. Why doesn't this have a parental advisory label?!?!"
3,LARGE GENEVA,its too large...over sized...heavy...lot of space to put your laptop and much more...I think this is not to use every day...
3,Really nice but rather large and heavy,"Bought for my sister and she loved it initially. After a week she returned it as it was cumbersome to carry and heavy. She is a small lady 5'2"". The bag itself was high quality and very nice. I think she needs to buy a smaller laptop."
3,Very Good Looking Tote,"This tote is quite heavy, and when you add the notebook it is a real brick. However, I have been looking for a nice bag to protect and transport my 17"" notebook for a while, both in stores and on line, and this was by far the nicest one I found. It is good looking and solidly built. It has a padded pocket to protect the laptop. It also has pockets and slots for cards, pens, cables and other accessories, and there is plenty of room. My only complaint, besides the weight, is that it is all black, inside and out. If the inside were a different color it would be much easier to find the cables, the mouse, the flash drives, and all the other stuff I keep in there. But for the most part I am happy with this purchase."
1,"Poor Release, especially on a Mac","There are a lot of neat-o features in this release, though unfortunately, they're overshadowed by the terrible sluggish performance on Mac OS X Panther (a very fast OS) and frankly, I'm shifting my web design over to Adobe software because of this poor release. Mac users - don't buy Macromedia software until they fix the terrible performance and many show-stopping bugs!"
5,Awesome!,"I love Opus Cuatro! This Argentinean quartet has been around since 1968 delighting their listeners with the blend of their voices in incredible arrangements of Latin American folk songs as well as Argentinean tango. You can hardly believe they are singing a capella. If you like tango, or if you are not sure but would like to try, I recommend this CD. It includes a great selection of all time favorites."
4,These guys rock,"A solid collection of songs from an under-known, under-appreciated band. These guys are lean and muscular, tight to the point of telepathy. Buy this album."
1,Who are you?,"Who are you? Our family history is very limited, we have never heard of you and would like more information. {:ease give us your genetic history to the Zempich name,"
2,Tabloid fodder,"Several of Miyamoto's (R.I.P.) points are relevant, but some of his broad generalizations border on the sensational. His obsession with the notion of Japan being one huge big brother unit is quite amusing. His blind assertion of Western cultural superiority is idealistic and mislead. Not to say that his arguments don't deserve any merit at all, but this is the type of thinking that will kill Japan in the long run (in fact alot of the recent proposals for ""reform"" run along these lines). That said, his sob stories about bullying sound more like paranoid delusions. The whole office trip bit was pure fluff, and lacks the objectivity and professionalism one would expect from a doctor. Should be taken with a grain of salt."
2,Warren does no wrong,"If you love(d) former Chief Justice Earl Warren you'll love this book. It's a PR piece and nothing more. Pollack attempts to glorify Warren without raising more than a sentence or two of criticism. If you would like to learn as much as possible about Warren, but don't want to read more than one Warren book, pick a different biography."
5,Awesome,"At first when I got this product I thought it will probably work if I scrub the heck out of my kitchen floor, I was wrong, I have never seen anything like it, my floors had about 6 years of wax build-up, it came right off, unbelievable, it was coming off as like a greenish black juice looking junk, then I had a little green scrubby thing and scrubbed lightly and it came off as like a white powder residue rinsed off and ding*****, shiny, clean, fresh floor, when I finished I was so happy to choose this product, will buy again."
4,It Does What It Says...,"I was a little disappointed that something that has 'Instant' in it's description really took longer than that, but if you follow the directions, it works. It's just a lot more work than 'Instant' would imply."
1,Don't waste your money...,"I had been searching for a product to remove the wax off of my tile floor and decided on this one based on the reviews. And guess what? It didn't work! I diluted it with water, just like it said do, and nothing happened. I tried it undiluted on a small area and it peeled up a little bit of wax in a spot no bigger than the palm of my hand. This product blows. If you want your floors cleaned like you want them, invest the money and call a place like Stanley Steemer. That's what I'm gonna do! I bet they can get the floor cleaned. Lol Chao baby. ;)"
2,Production not very Good,"If you want a Frau for the singing alone then buy a CD -- if you want something to look at you will be disappointed. This is very typical Gunter Schneider-Siemsen. If you like his productions you may like this DVD -- personally I hate his productions as he always updates something or makes it too modern. The best production on Video is one from Paris in the 1980's - the video is very dark, but it is a great production, very magical and captivating. In short it has everything this staging does NOT. Someone read the libretto and the state directions for the Paris staging, something not done for this version. Very dull and prosaic visually. The singing is good, but then for the singing you can buy a CD and not have to look at this terrible staging."
2,misses the point,"This book is literally for kids. Just by the cover you get a hint. Genghis khan was prominent for his blue-green eyes, long beard, and fair skin. The guy on the cover looks more like a turk than a mongol. For anyone serious about Khan i reccomend Conqueror of the World by Rene Grousset. its still the most definitive work on the mongol overlord."
3,Confused,"This was somewhere inbetween a history book and a novel. Its a quick read with some good info, but its more appropriate for entertainment because of its lack in depth. Because of these strengths and weaknesses that I give it 3 stars."
5,Spot on !!!,"Product arrived safe and on time. Quality/genuine time piece as advertised,I have had it on since then :).Will buy from Jacobtime anytime, they are reliable and keep you up dated. Many thanks."
2,"A political-financial history of the ""Dual Contracts""","Peter Derrick's book covers the ""Dual Contracts"" era of subway construction in New York, when numerous lines were built between 1910 and 1931 by the IRT and the BRT /BMT. Derrick focuses on the interactions between executives of the then-existing subway companies and municipal politicians. Only a few paragraphs cover the ""Independent"" subway system, which was built after 1931.Endnotes, bibliography, etc., comprise 155 pages of this book, or nearly a third of its pages. There are eight maps and 24 period photographs. There is nothing in this book about station design, track layouts, operating procedures, or rolling stock. In fact, the book ends when construction began. It was a worthy endeavor of historical research to document the political deal-making of this period, but some readers may be disappointed that the author's interest was solely in the back-room political gamesmanship that preceded construction"
5,Magnificent Music,"This CD is a true masterpiece. It is so difficult to tell which song is the best, but does it matter? Enjoy!!!"
2,OK,"This book was ok. I expected more sample letters, business cards templates and an actual plan or timeline as a guide. Also focuses more on military housseholds. It does provide good reasoning for businesses to use VA's and lists all the possible businesses that might utilize a virtual assistant."
5,A must have for all freelancers!,"The very best book on virtual assistance - hands down!I learned so much from the book and absolutely loved the way the authors made it an interesting read as well as great information.Like most people, I have a hard time getting through most business books. They are so dry that no matter how wonderful the content is they're painful to read.The 2-Second Commute was hard to put down. The self-assessments are wonderful. We (my husband and I) loved the Spouse With a Mouse section, and the marketing section is the best I've read in any book. Easy to follow and with a template for drafting your own strategic marketing plan.A must have for all freelancers!"
5,The perfect book for new VRA's,As a new VRA this book helped me the understand the community what virtual assisting is all about. This book can be truly read in just a few hours.
3,Helpful information,I decided to purchase book because I had seen it on military.com's military spouse career center. It does have quite helpful information for beginning a virtual assistance business.
3,yet another home / web based business manual,"90% of what this book covers appears in countless other books for small and home based businesses. And, I'm not so sure that the other 10% is really so revolutionary because the concept of working remotely has been around for several decades now. The authors outstanding accomplishment seems to be giving what they believe to be a revolutionary new job category a catchy name. Still, if you've been living on a distant planet, you may find their mention of the basic components, requirements and legalese of starting a business helpful."
3,not finished with it ... too busy right now,not finished yet ..... need more time for something like this ...have only briefly leafed ... that's how i gave it the three stars..
5,Powerful. Positive. Perfect!,"This book was perfect! The positive tone touched me and reminded me of all the good things in life and about myself. I had allowed myself to slip into a ""just a mom"" mindset and the authors nudged my morale - reminding me that there is no such thing as ""just"" when it comes to parenting.They showed me how we, as a family, could identify our core values and build a business that would accommodate and support them. My husband and I learned so much about ourselves as we worked through the ""spouse with a mouse"" exercises.The powerful information and tools provided in the book set me on the right course - emotionally as well as business wise - and helped me build a business that works around my children, makes me feel more complete, is already adding to our income, and has improved our overall quality of life.I cannot say enough good about The 2-Second Commute! Thank you for the inspiration, humor, and motivation!"
5,The proof is in the clients I now have!,"Before I read this book, and learned the importance of self-knowledge and focus in business ventures, I had so many ideas swimming around in my head and no sense of direction.The exercises and information in the 2-Second Commute helped me sort through the ideas and figure out which ones were most viable, which I was likely to be happy with over the long run, and which the marketplace is ready for.I also learned how important it is to find a target audience and tailor my marketing efforts to address their needs.Oh, one more thing, I learned what is't like to land that first client by following the advice in the book! I will always remember how good it felt when my strategic marketing plan paved the way for my first client. And my second! AND MY THIRD!"
1,Definitely NOT like Chamba Chai,"If you're looking for something to drink since Chamba Chai is no longer produced, DO NOT LOOK HERE! The tea flavor is MUCH stronger, the sweet and smooth quality of the drink is gone, AND this is not a low caffeine drink. VERY disappointing product of Big Train which is advertising this to be a replacement of Chamba Chai. Now I have to make my own chai blend of spices with decaff tea."
2,Pricey but fun,"I LOVE IT, but I got mine 3 or 4 years ago and I got her on ebay for about $60 and it was without the tag but still I don't go on the website I love playing with them I have all of them. I got my cheeky dog when it came out and it was like 15 bucks and my cheeky cat I bring EVERYWHERE and it annoys me that it is this much money come on make it 15 bucks again that's a pain I spent all my Christmas money on her and that's just 2 much!!!!!!!!!!!! I recommend to get it on ebay."
5,The Quintessential Punk Album,"I first heard Against Me! in the backdrop of my friends room, I thought, ugh, this aint that great please change it...but it didn't matter, the moment I went back to check them out to hear more I was hooked.Normally I would only honor an album w/ 5 stars if it was The Clash or Hendrix, but wow. I will not be the least bit surprised if I'm not listening to this album in 20 or 30 years from now. I'm not a punk, but my god, everything about this folk rock outfit screams (literally) for salavation in music. I really don't know what to say that hasn't been said, but buy the record if music means anything to you."
2,Nothing to do with Axl.,"I was on an Axl Rose kick one day and this came up. I thought I'd check it out and besides his picture on the cover and one song that mentions him, it really didn't have anything to do with it and I'm otherwise not interested in this type of music."
1,Barfaroo,"Absolutely terrible. Wow,a bunch of drunk guys holler and ""play"" their instruments. Listen to some real music you tasteless wannabes."
2,Torn,"On the one hand, I love the instruments on this album. On the other hand, the semi-coherent babbled screams they call lyrics cover them most of the song. I'd love to see a remix, though..."
3,Murder IN the Orient,"Nick Lamp, an American educated Chinese, is invited to discuss a business proposition with a Taiwanese underworld boss. When he arrives at the address he was given, he almost stumbles over the body of the boss who has evidently just been murdered.Nick finds himself caught up in an intrigue involving past secrets with former big time politicians and their female companions, and becomes an unwitting pawn in a larger game of international espionage. He is forced into a run and hide situation as the body count grows around him."
2,"Great plot, poor execution","I read the outside book cover description of this story and thought this would be a really great story! CEO's all over the US getting killed and the FBI tracking down the master culprit! Good set up, but, unfornately, the actual story is, well, kind of lame. None of the characters are interesting at all and you sure don't feel any sense of urgency to find the killer. I loaned this book to friend and he had the same opinion so it wasn't just me. I give it a 2 out of generosity."
4,real player from the dirty south,"many sides of a thug is a real underground project.its a real trill ass album about the south and nashville,tn.unfortunately he is incarcerated from law troubles but im glad i could write this review about a real ass ni##a from tennessee. please amazon customer,dont write anything negative about this album or review if so let me know how ya feel! listen to the album first! i hate a fake ass hater!"
4,ALL ABOUT DRAMA,"I THINK THIS GUY IS CURRENTLY LOCKED DOWN,CHECK OUT THE CD ghetto monster - the opening song (ghetto monster) IS ONE OF THE BEST RAP SONGS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!STEVE GREEWADE IS all about drama - he got diamonds in his mouth,cooking steak and lobster, DO YA -sitting in marble - FROM THE DAY THEY WAS BORN THEY WAS TRAINED TO GUARD."
2,Songs previewed are remakes from original. Not good.,"After previewing the songs on this CD, I was disappointed because they were re-makes from the original recordings from the 1970's and didn't sound as good. They tried ""updating"" them which didn't impress me."
2,Ditto,"Sadly, I must support the opinions of the reviewer who preceded me here. If you want to get into this material, you need to go with the recordings by the original ensemble prior to their break-up in the mid-30s. There are two or three tracks of interest here, but unfortunately the disc overall is a pale, limp imitation of past glory. I'm still looking around for a desirable first choice, but while I can't offer a positive recommendation at this point I can definitely second the notion that this is one to avoid."
2,BEWARE! BEWARE! Mostly COMEDIAN Harmonists,"The COMEDY Harmonists were the successor to the COMEDIAN Harmonists started by the three Jewish members who left Germany about 1935. There are only SEVEN tracks by the COMEDY Harmonists with the rest being by the original group and readily available in MANY other CDs so the title of this CD is VERY misleading and deceptive. Furthermore, the 12 by the original group are 12 of the least enjoyable or interesting of their recordings. So, you may wish to acquire this CD for the seven recordings by the Harmony Comedians but be aware the rest are just duplicates of slow, unfunny and somewhat routine recordings from the COMEDIAN Harmonists. An extra star deduction was given for the false advertising and the very poor choice for the recordings included by the original group."
4,Extremely Interesting,"It isn't easy to find music like this -- who knew? Some of the music is a little strange to our ears, but worth listening to for that very reason, for the sounds of the original and reproduced instruments, and for the simple insight it lends to history."
4,Soothing Sounds,"Purchased this CD to help my 6th grader with an Ancient Egypt social studies presentation. She played this CD in the background and it played well. Good for background music, soothing and melodic."
1,Not an honest translation,I nearly fall into the trap with Rashad Khalifa's ludicrous notions imbibed in his translation of the Koran...he changed numerous verses of the koran to suit his claims but I have verified with both Muslim and Christian Arab scholars and I justify that this translation is translated not according to the original text
5,THE ONLY TRANSLATED VERSION THAT I WOULD TRUST.,I HAVE READ AND STUDIED THE KORAN IN FARSI. THE ENGLISH VERSION BY DR. RASHAD KHALIFA IS REMARKABLEY SIMILAR IN DETAILS. THE FOOTNOTES HELP TO CONSUME THE VASTNESS OF KORAN. THE FINAL MIRACLE OF THE KORAN STRENGTHENS MY SPIRIT AND REJUVENATES MY LIFE. I LOVE GOD AND PROUD TO BE A MUSLIM.
1,Non-Muslims: beware of Rashad Khalifa and his translation,"Let this be a warning for non-Muslims like myself on Rashad Khalifa's translation of the Quran: it is inaccurate, agenda-oriented, biased, and heretical.I must admit that I was duped into believing what Khalifa had said in his so-called ""translation,"" but once I went look for sources on Islam other than his, I found that not had he done Islam's holy book a great injustice, but he also brought a greater injustice to Islam and its billions of believers. He claims that he is bringing authentic Islam in his translation, but he is briging lies and heresies to unknowning non-Muslims. This so-called ""translation"" should not be trusted and non-Muslims should look elsewhere for a better translation of the Quran. Avoid this translation and Khalifa's ""poision"" like the plague."
5,impossible to ignore,"the clearest and most detailed translation of the Quran with amazing statistical analysis of the text. For the first time in history, we have a built-in proof that the Quran is the unaltered, original and complete word of God. A proof that is verifiable by anyone. So powerful is the proof, that in a few generations it will become obvious, that any religion or any group of people(including the majority of so-called muslims), which advocates faith, as a pre-requisite or basis for belief will immediately be exposed as a false religion. Since we now have proof, blind faith is no longer valid. ""You shall not accept any information, unless you verify it for yourself. I have given you the hearing, the eyesight, and the brain, and you are responsible for using them."" (17:36)"
5,fantastic,The book is great for kids. I especially love that all illustrations are actually paintings!
4,very informative book,the most informative book about women in rock. it made me buy many great cds and that`s what is all about: to seek new music and to find new favorites.
1,Paper won't peel cleanly away from fabric,It is frustrating at $2-$4 a sheet to have the paper not cleanly come off the fabric. I followed the instructions and let the ink dry and then soaked it in cool water in hopes of softening the paper shreds left on the back of the fabric. It did soften it but then the ink ran!
2,old,"Product was old, material was yellowed. Was not what I expected, I expected clean white fabric on paper as when I buy it in a store"
5,Adds the most to the game,"This EP adds more options to the Sims2 than the others so far (not including Pets, which came after OFB). Player can create almost any business they can imagine. There are many challenges and rewards when running a Sims businness, as well as humorous things that can go wrong. In University, once a player figures out how to get a student through college, there's only so much left to do. OFB, on the other hand, offers virtually endless possibilities. I plan to get Pets, but will continue to play OFB, maybe even incorporating pets into some businesses."
3,"Love Sims, OfB is ok","It's a little harder to get going in Open for Business than I expected. I own Sims and several expansions and I didn't feel this one was as intuitive as the others to get started. Once I got going, it became easier. It seems to take a while to earn badges and I wasn't entirely sure at first how to earn them, but again, once I got going it wasn't too bad. Remember that if you open a business on your home lot, LOCK the house doors so that customers are not coming in whenever they please (very annoying). Also remember to buy an Open/Closed sign or people will always be coming over. In my neighborhood with 10 families, I only have 1 with a home business. It's taken time to figure it out, but it's working out. I wish there were a few more things I could do with the business, but this is a neat dimension to add to the Sims."
1,Skip this drive,This drive runs very hot with constant use. If you just need it for occasional use then you may be ok. I used mine everyday and after about 5 months it died.
1,"all show, no go.","perhaps lacie should work out the bugs on something like this. in their haste to launch a ""cool looking"" apple-esque product, they forgot to make sure it worked 99% of the time.my experience mirrored a previous reviewer who said it failed to ""recognize"" my mac. of course, it happened to me when i was working on a massive deadline, so needless to say it will be a cold day in a hot place before lacie gets any more of my money. it was all show, no go."
5,LaCie Rugged Drives,"LaCie Rugged All-Terrain 301015 120 GB USB 2.0/FireWire400/FireWire800 Portable Hard DriveI'm a video producer and use these for media storage and editing both at the office and on the road using firewire cords. They're bus-powered, so they run off our Macs with ease -- and we have zero latency issues...even with HD material.Phenomenal product. We've got at least half a dozen of them in varying storage sizes, and they're built for bear. They really are rugged and handle abuse -- drops, jostling, heat, cold -- on the road, in flight, in the field, etc.When we shoot our video in file formats and have to deliver raw HD material at the end of a shoot vs. editing it, we buy one of these for the project and just hand them off to our clients when it's all done. Never had an issue and always had good feedback."
5,Plug it and use it! it also looks so cool!,"I just took it out of the box, plugged it and instantly appeared in my ibook's desktop. The data access is really fast through the firewire and it looks so cool!"
1,DID NOT WORK! (DEFECTIVE) Return PAINFUL!,Have owned several WD external drives with no problems this one would not work...on the PC on the MAC etc.The package arrived quick enough...The internal packing list is so sanitized you dont know who or where to return the item to. The return is AGONIZING! came from BEACH Audio ...AVIOD THESE GUYS! Getting a return authorization number is a nightmare!@ Multiple e-mails and calls to them...ugggghhhhhh!Much better off getting from the MAC store! BUYER BEWARE!I totally expect NOT to get my refund!
1,did not work,"This drive has a great aesthetic design, but did not work out of the box when I received it. Amazon delivered promptly as usual, but quality of this product is definitely lacking. Look at the Western Digital... that's what I now have and have had no issues."
4,A fine book,"I just started my law school teaching career by teaching Torts, and I was a bit baffled at Cardozo's fame. Judge Posner explains the extent to which Cardozo stood head and shoulders above other jurists in notoriety, speculates why this is so, shows why Cardozo's reputation as a Supreme Court justice is dimmer than his reputation as a state judge, and dissects Cardozo's opinions. I thought that his discussion of Cardozo's literary style was especially masterful, as was his explanation of Cardozo's advantages in obtaining a great reputation.The only part of the book I found lacking was Posner's discussion of individual cases, which was a bit less exciting than the rest of the book. Before reading the book I was not convinced that the infarmous Palsgraf case deserved its notoriety-- and I still don't get the Palsgraf mystique that seems to entrance so many other law professors and lawyers."
4,Great General Information!,"Got my first computer (really) two weeks before Christmas. It has Windows 98 as the operating system. With the computer I received two books to help get me started. Win 98 for Dummies and The User Friendly Guide To Internet & Computer Terms. Both are great. Win 98 for Dummies takes you step by step thru the process of getting acquainted with a computer. The User Friendly Guide has a great dictionary along with tons of tips and articles about computers and the Internet. There's so much to know! If you need a great reference book, spend the money and get both of these."
4,"exellent, well written",The windows 98 for dummies got the job done. I learned alot from this book. This is a must book if you're just starting out. bob fav
2,It's a fair introduction but woefully inadequate.,While it does enable a beginner to get started in Windows98 it is hopelessly incomplete.It affords very little help when you run into trouble and is very poorly indexed. One could do with a little less cutesy language and a little more substance.
3,YOU CAN DO BETTER! BELIEVE ME!,"I did this whole tutorial book. So I am a little bit grateful. After you buy the book, throw away the CD. It's virtually worthless. Use it as a coaster for your drinks and freak out your friends. Now see the movie ""The Merry Widow"" (1933).Maurie Chauvalier: Don't I look terrific? Jeanette MacDonald: Funny, yes. Terrific, no!Well, that about sums it up. There are huge ""blocks"" in this tutorial. Like you are walking on a bridge and some of the planks are missing. And then you have to trace your way back and figure it out yourself! I had to do this 3 times. The book is okay, Just don't buy it. Buy ""Running Microsoft Windows 98"" by Craig Stinson. The doctors won't have to keep taking skin grafts because you keep tearing out your hair. And there isn't any phoney CD. Good luck!"
2,poor job,does anyone know how to edit location bar?Is there any way to remove this information? Maybe not.Somebody goofed!
3,Not a Desktop Reference.,"Do not buy this book if you want to use it for a Reference. At least 3 times, I have looked in it for troubleshooting certain PC problems and could find only a line or two, if even that, on what i was looking for."
5,An Incredible Delight and The Best Way to Learn Windows 98!,"The is THE book to buy if you want to learn Windows 98! Andy has an incredible sense of humor which will lighten the tension of learning this subject. But his teaching ability is even higher. How would you like to paint a camel with your computer? Or learn how to use Wordpad and Notepad. My entire text is underlined. It did not to be. But I make things hard on myself. Andy does the one thing that very few writers do. He makes what seems complex very simple. I have this book next to my college text on COBOL. Both books did me a great service. But I gave Andy a bad review. Why? IT still was hard work. But Andy made it easier. Now go paint yourself a camel with your computer. You can't, can you? Go buy the book. And this book has no CD as I stated before. That must have been ""Classical Music for Dummies"". Good luck!"
2,TOO MUCH 'FLUFF',"In reading this book, I was frustrated by too much unnecessary language. Having just bought my computer, and a total novice, I was anxious to learn every aspect of Windows 98. I was not impressed by the author's humor and feel it was a rediculous waste of paper. I didn't want 'fluff', I wanted 'meat'! It also didn't provide the 'in depth' information I was looking for. This book was far from meeting my needs. If you are serious about learning ALL of 'Windows 98' quickly, look elsewhere."
1,Shrug book,Not what I had in mind. I was looking for shrug patterns and there was about 1. Not my cup of tea.Teresa
4,More please,"Although they are from Europe, Gomez comes across much like a California band in possession of loopy optimism This five song CD showcases Gomez's ability to stray from the predictable. If it's about keeping it fresh then these boys nailed it. All five songs are tinted with unique sound. If heard on different days one might ask if this is the same group. It is such a good thing because so many bands rely on the same sound over and over again. Sometimes smooth sometimes not Machismo feels like an experiment and there is nothing wrong with that. These boys rely on curiosity rather that security."
2,WARNING!!! Do Not Buy! You Won't Get What's Advertised!,"I paid $18.00 for this item, then when it arrives, I get a Black Hole Sun single that has two additional tracks. A terrible live version of Jesus Christ Pose, and a great live version of Beyond The Wheel. I already have the Superunknown album version of Black Hole Sun, and the live JCP is bad. So I paid $18.00 for one good song. I really wanted to hear Soundgarden's version of Black Sabbath's Into The Void, but I guess that won't happen since I was a victim of false advertising. If this isn't the item that's for sale, why are they claiming it is? Bush league stuff man!"
2,Boring to Average Production,"There were only 4 good songs on this album. As for the rest, they left me feeling pretty neutral. That is, there were a lot of songs that weren't terrible, but at the same time, I wasn't really vibing with the production on them in the least.I'd definitely recommend listening to all song samples before you buy. There is just not enough heart in the production for me."
5,Old Faithful,"I purchased this cookbook to replace my old copy that had disintegrated from use. Pages were missing including a family favorite chili recipe. I am absolutely delighted with this collection of easy, dependable tasty recipes. This is not for gourmet cooks, but great for comfort foods and tasty family meals."
2,"OK, but there's much better","Probably would have been better if fresher. No ""head"" at all in my French Press. Not much flavor indicating it sat on a shelf too long.With coffee, fresh is the key word. For the freshest coffee and very good prices I recommend Coffee Bean Direct."
2,Weak - no flavor,"I bought the French Roast, which was excellent, and this one, which I found to be weak and watery. There was no flavor to it. Would not buy again."
2,"Ok, I'm not a coffee connesieur, but...","When I first opened up the bag, I didn't get that fresh smell of great coffee. It smelled like flavorless, strong coffee (which is, surprise surprise, how it tastes.) Plus the beans are really greasy... what does that mean? Not a fan."
3,Not Strong Enough,If you are looking for robust flavor and a darker roast this is not the one.Beans seem a little dry and maybe a bit old.
4,"Good, fast read","This book was really well written and a good, quick read. I enjoyed it from beginning to end."
2,kenneth is a wackadoo,"So this is the worst album ever made and shouldn't be sold in stores...it's pretty funny though. You need to keep in mind that Kenneth Keith is the same guy who appeared on the Howard Stern show tryig to blow smoke out of eyes. Another occassion he cut all his hair off and ate it on stage and then exploded a firecracker off down the frot off his pants! The guy is a little nuts and so is this stupid cd. As kenneth would say ""stalk""."
1,Barney?,"Really disgusting. (only morons-- or cretins??? like this.) Anyone with a real taste in music will listen toMetallicA's MASTER OF PUPPETS,the Greatest Metal Album ever made.'Nuff said."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this book and the ""Dummies Guide to 529."" I thought this book would be more informative given its Standard & Poor's association. Instead, much of the book was filled with lists of merchants (for upromise) and specific examples that did not pertain to me. I did not find any basic, straightforward information about 529's. I found better information using the internet! I wish this book had explained what to consider when selecting a 529 in checklist form. I wish I had not purchased this book."
3,"Spotless, Sinless, Christian, Virgin Chased by Gnarley Dude","My favourite part is when the crowd at a Roman arena yell at two scantily clad Christian women until they retreat and reemerge decently dressed. Then, properly attired, they are torn apart by beasts, to the delight of the crowds.It makes me wonder if this has any modern application."
1,Dreary Turgid Claptrap,If I could give this less than one star I would do. The only good thing is that I didn't buy it. A friend passed it on to me saying that I would get a chuckle out of it. I did - for about 4 pages.
4,The Martyrs,The Martyrs is a well written story of fantasy woven with a deep knowledge of actual historical facts. The authur slowly build on each preceeding chapter and captures the readers attention along the way. A very well written book. I enjoyed it very much.
4,Excellent resource for cold region herb gardeners,"I am new to herb gardening, and to the Midwest. This book has been an excellent resource. I've been herb gardening in Zone 3 for 3 years now.The only drawback I can see is that I would like more specific information on each plant. But it has a lot of information about herbs that grow here, plus tips on gardening naturally. It also includes interesting factoids on herbs throughout history.I highly recommend this to up and coming gardeners!"
4,really liked it,"This is the best album they have made. It is so much punkier than the others. The only problem is that the tracks are to short. But the tracks flow into each other so it really doesn't matter. The other albums they made are to slow, but this one has a lot of fast songs. When I first heard it I thought they were blink 182, but after awhile they came to have their own sound. Very good lyrics and tunes. Go buy it and support The Ataris."
4,LISTEN,"I know some of the people in this band, and although you might think that means I have to like them your wrong. I always told myself I hated their music becuase Jason had the hots for my girlfriend. After I stopped and listened I realized that these people are the real thing. Their music is lyricaly the most real I have ever heard. Listen to em' they are good."
1,WHAT?!?!?!?!?,"The average review is 4 stars?!?!?!?! What is this? What is this world coming to. Simple, the world is infested with wannabe punks that are too chicken to listen to the Misfits, Ramones, or Dead Kennedies. You guys are way too guillible. Just cuz they call themselves punk doesn't mean that they are. Anyways, most punk sucks besides what is listed above. Go listen to some Behemoth, In Flames, Black Sabbath, Megadeth, Exodus, or Slayer.Oh, this album...it sucks too bad to mention. about a -999999/10 not too bad compared to some Simple Plan but it does suck."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS BLUE SKIES,Well I got this cd about 2 weeks ago and I dont think this is as good as the old Ataris CDs. There are a few songs i like but if i were you i would just burn it from a friend.
5,It's Good,"This album isn't anything like the other Ataris albums that some people may be used to but that doesn't mean that this album shouldn't be thrown aside. This album shows the other side of the Ataris before they matured. The songs are short, fast, and loud and they can still pull it off. Well, Kris can still pull it off. You can't even compare this to the other albums because it sounds so different. I think that this is a great rock, punk, or whatever the hell category you want to put it in. Best songs are Hey Kid, Are We There Yet, Alone in Santa Cruz, and Make It Last."
5,*The Ataris* are the puck/ska gods of the world!,"This c.d. hosts some of the tightest tracks I've ever heard! They have killer lyrics, and a great sound. Every single song here is worth while, a c.d. you can play the whole way through without getting bored! I recommend it to anyone who loves fabulous music!"
1,Do not buy these!,"Terrible set of headphones. Uncomfortable fit, and they look really, really ugly and awkward. Mediocre sound quality, broke very easily. I would never buy these again. It was a terrible waste of money. I would much rather buy a slightly more expensive pair than go for these, because they broke and had to be replaced far too soon. I wouldn't recommend these for use with an mp3 player at all, because the cord is wayyyy too long for easy portability."
1,Crummy experience...,"Sent wrong battery first time, my spec was insufficient, shipper did not call for additional information, just shipped what they picked. Did not fit phone. Called shipper, gave them full details, returned first battery at my expense, they reshipped another which did not match my supplied specs. Battery could not recharge phone. Result: I tossed out both battery and phone...had to buy a new phone. Ouch!"
5,"Thank you, Colcannon","I concur with all the thoughtful and nice things written about this album and this band.For me it is a little personal. I lived in Boulder, Colorado about 15 years ago. I saw them, talked with some of the musicians on different occasions. Wonderful people, great memories or the James Pub where they often were playing.Great album, of course. For me, in particular, a very nostalgic, incredibly emotional tune, ""Stella Maris"", composed by Doug Berch, who left the band a long time ago, so they don't play it anymore on stage. Stunning beauty, magical inspiration. I am thankful for what Colcannon has done over the years."
1,It [stinks]!,"I listened to Go, Go and I liked it so I bought the CD. I soon found that the rest of the songs don't sound anything like I thought they would. I listened to the CD once and then abandoned it. It's the worst in my CD collection."
2,B4-4 is 2Late~ This CRAZE is OVER !,"Sure they really can sing, however, they're 7 years to late to embark on the music scence with a BOYZBAND musical format.I predict they'll be found in the bargain bins at most national music outlets beside other ""HAS BEEN boy bands"" such as ""ALL FOUR ONE"" and ""COLOR ME BLIND"" faster than these guys learn to spell the name of their group ""BEFORE FOUR"".What was SONY MUSIC thinking ? ? ? ? ? ?"
2,Possible choking hazard,"This is a very cute toy and tons of fun for my 7 month old. However, the balls present a possible choking hazard. They seem to be just the right size to get lodged in a baby's mouth. Ever since I realized this, I've only allowed my baby to play with the stacking rings."
3,cute,My 8 month daughter likes this toy but plays with the rattle balls more than anything else. It did not keep her attention that long and she did get her finger pinched by the door.
4,unusual and versatile,"My son, at about 6 months old, loves this toy. Even though he is not into stacking the soft rings, or dropping the balls into the center of the toy, he loves to play with the rattling balls (rolling them and picking them up) and chew on the rings. It is nice to be able to turn off the music for now. This toy is unusual-looking, but definitely captures my son's attention!"
2,"Fun toy, but not very durable","I purchased this toy for my 7 month old about 2 months ago. Like many 7 month olds, he loves to chew on anything he can get his hands on. Unfortunately, he has chewed a hole in the seam of one of the rings. Easily fixed with a needle and thread, but I didn't expect to have to do that with a 2 month old toy!"
3,The colors are nice.,"Santa brought this to our (at the time) 9 month old daughter for Christmas. Looked like it would be great fun. Not so much. So far she will only play with it if you don't have anything else for her to play with. On the upside, the cats absolutely love the balls. I don't have any problems with it...well made, looks really cute...nice toy...my child just doesn't like it."
2,Less than I expected,"For the price the toy is less than expected. I was disappointed. The real test was my grand daughter, who lost interest quickly. :("
5,Entertaining!,"This turned out to be my grandson's favorite Christmas gift. He received a large number of other toys, but he chose to play with this one almost continuously. He is 18 months old."
4,fun developmental toy,"This toy is colorful, fun, creative, soft, developmentally helpful. The balls are a safe size for a baby's mouth. It encourages fine motor skills and a sense of ""building"" within a child."
1,Video disaster,"I couldn't watch more than 60 seconds of this DVD without getting dizzy, and I actually got a headache from being stubborn and trying to watch a few songs. It's that bad. Maybe I'm getting old, but I guess that only teenagers on drugs will be able to stand the absurd and never-ending video effects... and I'm pretty sure not even they could stand watching the whole thing in one sitting. I love Joe, but I wonder WHY he let the director do this... do they REALLY need this to ""reach out"" for an audience of crazed teens? No sane adult is able to endure the screen flickering non-stop for 2 hours. The only way to watch this video is turning off the TV and just listening to the audio."
2,not a review! previously done!,"hi,on JOE'S website recently they did mention that they had re-authored the soundtrack on the dvd? i am not sure what this entailed,but there was an address for exchanging the dvd,listed on the website! regards map47"
1,Oh man oh man!!!!,"Joe is one of my all time guitar heroes. But yes, this DVD is unwatchable. Did Joe actually approve the horrific production. His playing is top notch but the bright efx and images are too much to bear. Just keep it a straight concert production will satisfy all this fans.Can Joe reissue the DVD with the efx all taken out?"
1,Yes..the title says it all,Yes Joe..you just wanna rock..but we just want to see you play the guitar.When a guitar god plays..we just want to see him shredding in realtime..nothing more than that.Who's idea is it anyway? Those cheesy effects just does not do justice in this DVD.What a dissapointment. I just decided not to buy this DVD after viewing the clips on you tube.Joe Satriani should release another live concert video in HD..this time on blue ray.We want to see his fingers sweat while its running up and down the fretboard...that's all.
1,Worst edited Joe's video ever,You would do better turning TV off and listening to Joe's concert if you have a theatre system with this DVD.You may love it if you like MTV style video edits. It really didn't serve the purpose of watching Joe playing those wonderful compilations. I have watched almost all of Joe's live DVD concerts and this is probably one of the worst amongst them. Concert as such is really good but the video editing has spoiled the show.
1,Extremely Disappointing,"Totally agree with the other reviewers. Cheesy editing and ruined by too many effects. I'll say this as well - WHAT WAS JOE THINKING? The CD version is EXCELLENT!!! I'm assuming the majority of people buying this are guitar players or people who appreciate great instrumental guitar. One thing we want to see is great camera angles, close-up shots of Joe's hands, exceptional video quality and great editing. This DVD has none. Buy Joe's Live In San Francisco or Satriani Live! DVD's instead."
1,Music is good....video unwatchable,If you watch this dvd with your eyes closed it is awsome. to watch it is a hugh disapointment over all the other dvd's he has done. buy the cd so you wont be tempted to watch it.
3,I'm so dizzy!,"What a joke? At least the sound quality of the concert is great. Very loud, and loud is good! so I'll give it 3 stars for this alone. But this band, they just play so FAST. Lightning fast fingers that never let up. Dizzying. My eyes need a rest. Don't you get tired, Joe? I get tired just watching you blaze on every song. You are WAAAYYYY faster than other guitar players. So I say stick to this talent, and save the spirals and acid trip stuff to the other guitar guys who play slower, and can't play as ferociously as you. Oh yeah, plus they can't whammy like you either. Just up and down for them. You rule with your high pitched whammy SCREAMS that sound like rockets shooting thru the sky. So insane! So too much!"
1,very bad image,very bad moviecolorful watches everything you......blurredbetter to buy the CDnot like the moviehopefully in the next Joe video shows only the filming of the show without inventing
1,Really? Joe Satriani should sue...,"I read the other reviews about this DVD and was curious, but no they werent kidding. I found out a friend had this DVD and i borrowed it, and MAN...it reminds me of the old 60's videos you used to see on VH1 with all the zooming around and the weird effects. This is a complete DISGRACE to such an awesome aritst...whoever directed/produced this should have a court order keeping them away from any further video work. I dont know if Joe just signed off on this blindly, but..WOW!"
2,Terrible video,"Like so many other reviewers, I am a long time Satch fan and was really looking forward to this video. I received it for xmas and was immediately underwhelmed with the editing. The music and quality is 5 stars. But WHAT WHERE THEY THINKING IN POST?As other posters had commented, it's like some giant MTV video gone wrong. I JUST WANT TO WATCH HIM PLAY! It's WAY overcooked effectwise and too jumpy camerawise. Really sad as it ruins it for me."
5,Thanks for doing somthing different,"I read most of these reviews but got this DVD anyway. If you're a Joe fan you will like this DVD. If you're a Joe fan you probably already have his other DVD's (including Chickenfoot) which gives one plenty of material to watch Joe shred. We all know Joe is the biggest cartoon character there is, and this is his feature film starting the Bugs Bunny of guitar players. The song selection is great and this is a totally different set list than the other shows. When he played Time Machine that put me on another planet in another galaxy, absolutely fantastic! This DVD is something different. Thank you Joe for pushing the boundary as you do, and doing something different."
2,Please re-release without visual effects!,"I'm a huge Joe fan hence rating the dvd with 2 stars instead of one, but the visual effects destroy this dvd! The actual footage of the show is awesome... when you can see it through all the visual noise. It's supposed to be a live concert dvd. If anyone from Joe's camp reads this let him know to please re-release it without all the visual effects that no one at the concert would have seen, the it would actually be a cool dvd!"
1,Unwatchable,"What is it with taking live footage and turning it into something that doesn't even remotely resemble what it originally was?The whole thing comes off looking like some sort of lame late 80's MTV video on a severe acid trip. It's not a concert at all, just a hodge podge of really lousy special effects.I could initially watch only two songs before shutting it down. Extremely disappointing, given the outstanding quality of both Live in San Francisco and Satriani Live.Stick with the CD version of Live in Paris, which is fine. Avoid this disaster at all costs."
1,No stars,This DVD gets 1 star only because I can't give it ZERO. The video editor should be shot for ruining what could have been an excellent DVD.
3,Editing,"Just wanted to say, thanks for the warning about the editing. This horrible trend has made many of the dvd's that I own unwatchable. It's usually done with metal (Motorhead's Stage Fright is ridiculous).The more rock oriented dvd's are usually not that bad. Hope it's just a one time thing with Joe. Satriani Live! is great, by the way. Haven't seen this yet, but you have to rate it, so I'll say 3 as a wild guess!"
3,"I see what they wanted to achieve, but......",I was very excited about getting this DVD and pre ordered it promptly. Having been a long time fan the wait was excruciating. Having now watched it several times I commend the atristic approach that was taken and applaud the creativity used to present Joe's performance but the 'art of Joe's playing' is somewhat lost. Like many I love to 'watch' his proficient fretboard skills but find that it is lost in favour of 'flashy' celluloid direction. Having said that I do like the way it has been 'created' to I suppose enhance or show Joe in a different way..... Would I have preferred a more straight forward concert production? YES. Would I show this to someone to astound them with Joe's skills? NO. Will I watch it again and again? NO. Just a bit to 'artsy fartsy' for me.
1,Joe never do this again!,"Buy the CD of this as there is a strong performance here. Instead of this DVD, buy Satriani Live!, Live In San Francisco or The Satch Tapes DVD's instead. As others have mentioned the video editing is horrible and it's like someone just got their new video effects toy and pressed every button on it. I don't think there isn't a second of video that isn't processed. Horrible compression artifacts also when the video goes dark. Lots of strobing, out-of-focus, split-screens, fades and wipes. This is the what not to do guide to making concert videos. I want to see Joe and the band play, but the effects prevent me from doing this. It was tough to watch this video. I'm glad I only paid $7.99 for it, but even then I doubt I'll watch this again. It really is that bad. The only good video part is the 40 Minute interview. I hope Satriani Live! gets released on Blu-Ray as that was shot in HD."
3,Watch This On YouTube Before You Buy,"Watch this on YouTube before you buy it folks. They have about every track available. It is indeed an eye sore and very disappointing for a concert dvd. It seems that whoever was in charge was trying to make a huge music video for MTV or something, NOT a concert dvd like Live In SF. I give it a three stars based soley on the band performance, which is outstanding. Buy the cd though and save your eyes."
1,HEY JOE!,"I hate when they make videos like this, all the stupid special effects throughout the entire concert makes this almost unwatchable. I wonder if someone was to take drugs that it might reverse these stupid video effects and make it a normal crystal clear video the way it should have been. I'm glad I only paid $7.99 for this. I have to say that the song selection and the sound and the musicians are all top notch simply incredible on this DVD. I will be picking this concert up on CD. Hey Joe I would buy this concert DVD again if you re-released it without the video effects and while you are at it put it on blu-ray."
1,Come on Joe...your better than this!!!!!! (I Just Wanna Barf!),"I've been a fan of Joe Satriani for years (back to when he had hair) and have gone to just about every show that he done in the area for 20 years or so. He has a history of great videos but this video of his latest tour is unwatchable! The music is great (only reason it got 1 star) but the video sucks big time. The solarization, jumpy, bad 60's or 80's video (your choice) makes this video horrible. What was he thinking when this was approved. This is NOT a concert DVD, it's a really really BAD 90 minute MTV video. I saw this tour and it was one of his best but this video is his worst! Thank goodness I only paid $7.99 for it. Maybe he will read some of his reviews and re-issue this as a normal concert DVD. The effects are overdone, bad, horrible,and you can add any other description from the dictionary and you won't adequately describe how bad it is."
1,CRAP,"Does any of the DVD Video editors ever read these reviews? If they did they would see people don't like this crap. I don't how many reviews of crappy effects are reviewed on Amazon. People don't like this kind of stuff. Ie cheesy effects, fast cutaways back in fourth audience shots, Fake applause. Just shoot the dam concert. Why don't they get it. It can't be money. How much does I cost to point the camera and shoot. I wish someone who really likes this stuff had the balls to speak up and see how they get blasted. or better yet one of these editors and explain themselves, and really pay attention and learn from the feedback they receive."
4,Not that bad!!,"The bad reviews people have been giving this DVD is unfounded in my opinion. What do you want the same old thing. It's different,it's unusual and it's good. I would have been disapointed if it was the same as Live In San Fran or JSLive.The music is Great and so is Joe, Be Thankful."
1,Unwatchable,Mmmmm. This BLOWS!!!!!!!!!!! Can't watch. Just put it on through your stereo and turn off the TV. Why couldn't they shown the performers playing? What is wrong with that. NO MORE QUICK EDITING!!! NO MORE SPECIAL EFFECTS AND HAND HELD CAMERAS!!!! NO MORE NO MORE!!!!!!
1,Disappointing,I too can't believe Joe would allow the release of this DVD. Overdone video effects are NOT what his fans want to see. The music is great however. Just don't look at the screen. Bleah!How come the editor didn't put effects in the Interview?
1,Cheesy!!! - Joe are you kidding?,"I have to agree with all the other reviews. I too have been a long time fan/follower and own the other DVD's and albums and have seen him in concert. I preordered both the cd and dvd just because I am a huge fan. Buy the CD version, the playing is awesome as usual and the Prof. Satch material comes over great sound wise. If you want an idea what the DVD is like check out the podcasts on his Satchafunkilus album website. The video has all kinds of crazy tripped out effects, and no solid video of him playing a song, it jumps around with inserted images, slow motion playing, different playing(different guitars)all on one song. The halo's, starburts and exposure changes make it seem like a bad LSD trip. It really is laughable and over the top cheesy."
2,Why oh Why?!?,"All I can say is what everyone else has been saying. Amazing playing, but sickening, annoying, and just all around bad editing. Go with his other two DVDs, which are about 2097230958 times better because you can see him play. If you ever read this Joe, I would advise maybe rereleasing this with one camera zoomed in on you for the entire thing, no effects."
2,Forbidden for those who wanna keep their eyes healthy.,"I don't want to criticize Joe as an artist, because I believe he is not the person responsible for this video mess! He is an amazing guitar player and I will be watching him closely next October. He is coming back to Brazil, with other two guitar heroes (John Petrucci and Steve Morse), performing his songs in the G3 project. So, just do as I suggest: Turn on the TV only for accessing the DVD Menu. After you choose your configurations and it starts playing, turn off the TV, as it doesn't make no difference whether you watch the concert or not! Any chance of releasing this concert with NO EFFECTS at all? If the answer is YES, please somebody tell Joe to do it!"
3,George Washington Young Leader,"This book is interesting from a child's perspective. However the vocabulary and many of the concepts were a little too advanced for my twelve year old students to grasp. I was disappointed that the focus of the book was only on the youthful George Washinton. Since nothing much is known about his childhood, the author took a great deal of liberty in fleshing out the story."
5,A mystical experience!,"This book seamlessly weaves together esoteric Christianity and Kabbalah, enhancing both and compromising neither. Well done! Reading it is a mystical experience!"
2,Binding fell apart 1st read,"I love the book's content (4 star at least), but the binding started to fall apart the first day of reading. Small sections of pages keep falling apart from the binding until I have a book in over eight pieces so far (2 weeks) held together with a rubber band.Great book poorly manufactured (unacceptable). I haven't tried for a refund yet."
5,Phenomenal!,"I was mystically drawn to this book. I found myself getting a tube train to Watkins bookshop in London. When I got there I was wondering which book to buy out of their vast stock, none really appealed to me at the time,until I walked over to the other-side of the shop and saw this book displayed. I knew straight away it was what I was looking for. And so I bought it straight away and left. The sales assistant kept looking at me as I had been in there ages looking through books but as I saw this I grabbed it, barely looked through it and bought it. It can be a little hard to read because you have to keep looking up unfamiliar terms in the glossary. But the actual teachings, meditations and chantings are phenomenal. This author is highly blessed to bring this rare gem to us."
4,great sticker book,"My 20 month old daughter loves the animals from this sticker book. There are so many stickers, we will be enjoying them for a while :)"
3,"The book is okay, the recipes are terrific!",The book is worth any price just for the blueberry pie recipe.
3,Good game marred by length,"This is a good action beat 'em up game, similar to old games like final fight, streets of rage, double dragon etc... with DC setting and flash of course.Good graphics, cool details. Music is good. Cool levels. Enemies show some intelligence. Gameplay is simple and fun. Only problem is the game is too short, only 1 or 2 hours to finish.If it had 2 or more extra complete level and boss then this game would be great. Maybe another usable player too.Overall a good very very short game."
4,Great sound,I gave this as a gift to my daughter and she told me the sound and quality was great. She had others in the past but this one was the perfect item for her Ipod..
5,Some Good Suggestions,I have already learned why I have always had such trouble with high C which is that I've always thought I had to stretch the upper lip of the embouchure(sp?) but instead i should have rested the mouthpiece on the lower lip so as to permit the upper lip to vibrate freely. Now I'll have to see if it works.
4,What this is...,"There were no customer reviews for this CD, so I ordered it not knowing exactly what this is. Now that I have listened to it - for other curious customers - this is a 2 disc audio biography that you might hear on a radio show, with a narrator describing, interviewing, and playing snippets of songs. The person who wrote, produced, narrated and mixed it is Ron Lyons and is obvious how much Mickey Newbury's music has meant to him. It is very interesting and I am not sorry I purchased it. However, it is not anything you would put in your iPod. I'll find some other people to share this with and it will end up shelved as an interesting item. There are a few songs in entirety but they are part of the band of narration. You wouldn't be able to just bring up that song. I will be on the look out now for Mickey Newbury's albums which seem to be pretty hard to find. I think any fan of Mickey Newbury would definitely enjoy this!"
4,Time to Win,"This is a classy and useful reminder of the 2005 Chicago White Sox World Series Championship. Hopefully it will be displaced by future world series championships in 2007 or 2008, but in the meantime is a nice collector's item of Chicago's first world series championship since 1917.It's also quite useful, keeps good time and has an attracive appearance."
4,I love all Joel Salatin's Books!,It's great! It is very informative. He explains his beliefs about farm food vs. big chain food. He's explaination of locavore is the most detailed that I've seen and he truely lives his beliefs on the subject.
2,Fair to Middlin',"There is some worthwhile information contained in this book, but not presented very well. Most of the book seems to be a rather bitter diatribe by a very disgruntled individual."
4,Can't afford Disney World? Try this!,"My children and I have watched these tapes over and over. We can't afford a trip to disney world, so why not do the next best thing? The children love seeing the rides and the Hall of Presidents."
4,Good book with a lot of info on Tigers career,"Tiger Woods: An American master was a great book with almost everything you would want to know about Tiger and his lifetime of golf. The only reason why this book didn't get 5 stars is because the author, Nick Edwards, kind of over-did what he was sayin about Tiger, and believe it or not, made Tiger sound better than he really is (my personal opinion, although some of you may think you cant say enough about the man). But a well- written book that deserves to be read."
2,Good in a cultural perspective,"This book seemed more informative in the Indian culture that included marriage and relations. It translated the text parts of the Kama Sutra as well as pictures. Except the text that it translated has absolutely nothing to do with the pictures. In short, the pictures although not of the orginal Indian sculptures, are good where the text is not. It does not give directions to how to obtain the positions, just fact. Historically and culturally though, the book is good."
2,Only good in a cultural perspective.,"This book seemed more informative in the Indian culture that included marriage and relations.

5,Instructions for running a workplace spiritual group,"Life And Livelihood: A Handbook For Spirituality At Work by Episcopal priest Whitney Wherrett Roberson (Associate Pastor of Grace Cathedral, San Francisco) addresses the necessity for spirituality in the setting where most people spend so much of their waking day -- their place of employment. Providing ""nuts and bolts"" instructions for running a workplace spiritual group, Pastor Roberson covers everything from forming a workplace group to facilitating a meeting, even to the pint of including detailed agendas for 45-minute meetings exploring such issues as to whether or not work can be sacred; the definition of real wealth, and how language shapes values. Thoroughly ""reader friendly"", Life And Livelihood is strongly recommended for Christians of all denominations, affiliations, and backgrounds wanting to instill Christian values into their workplace activities and relationships."
3,A So-So Work,"Lobby Hero is a ho-hum piece of work. While it contains its moments, there is certainly nothing here to knock someone off of their feet. As is per usual, Lonergan writes his dialogue well, but the characters are left a little lacking in motivations and overall arc. The lead character of Jeff is whom the author has spent the most time on, but the other characters fall by the wayside.What it all boils down to is that this seems to be Lonergan keeping in practice, not trying for greatness."
1,bad sequel,"this movie is probably the worst sequel that I have ever seen! please do yourself a favor, and stick to the original superfly. this film would have still been horrible, even if curtis mayfield had returned to do the score. pass on this one."
3,"Book, Does Anything Eat Wasps?",Strange little book. Something to pick up as you wish. Learn something new everyday...
3,Interesting Facts,"The purpose of this book is to bring to the general public the answers to those `everyday science questions' posed by readers of the New Scientist.Most people would be interested in the questions (yes, your bum is scientifically proven to look smaller in black), but some are just downright weird - one does wonder exactly why Ward von Norstom wants to know how fat you have to be to be bullet-proof.There were a lot of questions about alcohol. It might be interesting to students to discover the reason why darker alcohols give worse hangovers than `light' ones, such as vodka. Apparently, it's down to the different quantity of toxic chemicals called cogeners. Although the suggestion that drinking pure ethanol is the best way to avoid a hangover is perhaps best ignored.Overall, this book may not be for everyone but I'm sure there's at least one question you've always wanted an answer to."
2,Poor Quality,"Cheap, thin plastic. Flimsy. Foam rubber interior is lightweight and insubstantial. Hinges twist easily. Latches insecure. Don't use this case for expensive weapons."
5,Lorge Thorndike word book,"Years ago I used this book to compare ASL with English in the number of words used to communicate. Now, I'm teaching Japanese again and considering teaching younger students wanted to teach them the most used words by grade level and this was my resource. It is a tremendous work but slightly out of date as word usage in any language changes over the years. Still, it is a helpful start for my project."
1,GARBAGE,The Shades are plastic not glass and the color is electric blue not aqua. It looks every cheap!!!! I live in Mexico so returning it is not an option. Big waste of money!
2,A real let-down,"I am a big fan of J. Michael Straczynski & Gary Frank's SUPREME POWER series, so I had high hopes for the miniseries DOCTOR SPECTRUM: FULL SPECTRUM. But my hopes were definitely not met. Don't be fooled into thinking that FULL SPECTRUM provides essential insight into the events depicted in SUPREME POWER. Yes, it does provide background on Joe Ledger before the mysterious power crystal physically made itself a part of his life, but the events depicted in this story are fairly superfluous. Yeah, he had a tough life, and that's about it... well, gee. By the end of the story, I didn't feel that I understood anything more about Doctor Spectrum, the power crystal, or SUPREME POWER than I already did. Even then, it would have helped if Straczynksi and Frank could have handled this story, but they unfortunately farmed it out to Samm Barnes and Travel Foreman, who can't keep up with the standard set by the series creators. FULL SPECTRUM can definitely be skipped - you won't miss a thing."
2,Full Spectrum Was Empty,"All but a few pages of the story take place in Ledger's head while he is unconscious. I imagine parts of this story may become relevant later on, but unless you're a completist you can probably skip this volume in the Squadron Supreme pantheon."
4,Backstory,"This side edition to the Squadron Supreme rewrite, gives a good insight into the psyche of Dr. Spectrum."
5,Exciting and Well Worth Your Money. . .,"I am a huge fan of this anthology, particularly for the joy of spotting new authors that you are guaranteed to see again! This year's anthology does not disappoint. Order your copy today and support new writers!"
3,PS Retouching cookbook - quick and easy,"Good book but don't expect to learn photoshop from it.I would recommend this to someone very new to photoshop who may want to see a few basic tricks adn techniques that are available. Short adn quick way to seing that : this can be done! Buy a more detailed book afterwards but don't dissmiss this one if you are in the early stages of using PS, Lightroom or similiar."
3,Pillars of the Earth,"The story was interesting, but it had fairly explicit sex and violence which I did not like. However, it was in that regard true to the explicit violence and sex contained in the book, which I also felt was unnecessary."
4,Loved the book!,"I read various reviews of this series about how it might be difficult to follow, but having read the book, I enjoyed seeing the characters come to life. I was disappointed they made one female character merely scarred, but still beautiful, when she was described as the opposite. I think it was quite an undertaking to try to put this book into film, and I'm glad they did. Very worthwhile and I've seen it twice through!"
5,Pillars,This is a great DVD I would recommend it to others. We have shared it with family and friends and they all report it as being a fantastic video to watch. Ian McShane is incredible as always. It is not for our youth due to the language and content.
5,Excellent,"For a TV series they did an excellent job. Very high quality production, which my favorite book deserved. I'm so happy they didn't compromise. They did it right!"
4,the Pillars of the Earth,"The movie is a little different from the book. Some parts I felt was drawn out, but still enjoyable. All the actors did a great job in their parts. I especially liked Matthew MacFarden, what a wonderful actor. I wasn't prepared for so much nudity"
4,Pillars of the Earth,This DVD was purchased as a gift for someone who had just completed the 800+ pages of the book. He found it very true to the book and enjoyed seeing the book brought to life.
5,"Great book, great movie!","My favorite Ken Follett book has come to life with a great cast, wonderful scenery and a strong story. Wish there was more to the movie as the book had so much more action in it."
4,Just go with it,"I haven't read the story, so I watched this without comparing it to the book(s). I really liked it, it's not perfect but the acting is really good. There were only a few things that I couldn't help but notice which were pretty unrealistic... a small number of invaders comes to mind, aging, etc... but there's a super-sexy woman so that kinda makes up for all that... just wish they had shown more of her. :)"
4,Good series,"The first few series moved slowly, I fast forwarded thru most of the fighting scenes. The last 3 episodes were great, better than the book."
2,Actors retirement funds,"I have just finished watching `The Pillars of the Earth'. It was good to see distinguished older actors topping up their retirement funds. Being the true professionals that they are, putting their best foot forward they tried to inject some believability into the characters they were portraying by participating in this `Historical drama'. The performances of the younger members of the cast, with the exception of Liam Garrigan as Alfred, were underwhelming.The longer I watched this drama I had a constant impulse that was difficult to control, this was the desire to shout out loud, ""What a load of old codswallop"" as they say in the classics."
3,Not 1080p,"For all you interested in technicalities, despite the note on the packaging box saying 1080p; the video format of the Pillars of The Earth Blu-ray is 1080i/29.976"
3,Pillars of the Earth,"I have read the book. It is one of my favorite literary works by Ken Follet. I always thought it would be a fabulous movie. I suppose if it hadn't been a mini series it would have been. I found much of the plot to be left out. It seemed to be another renaissance movie much of the same of others. While the cast was fabulouso, the script left me cold. If I hadn't read the book, perhaps I would have enjoyed it more. Let's face it. You can't take a 600 page book and put it in a short version without leaving out important character building plots. I gave it 3 stars due to the actors and their performances. I am sure had the script had delivered 5 stars would have been obtainable."
5,renagirl,"I had just finished the book then got online to check out more books by Ken Follet. That is where I discovered that Pillars of the Earth had been made into a mini-series. I ordered the series right away. I figured that was one way for my husband to experience the book because he is not much of a reader. We both enjoyed the mini-series and it's cast of characters. The book is better but the mini-series certainly stands on it's own. Although everything may not be historically acurate, it is an interesting bird's eye view of what it is like to live in a different time in history. I will not soon forget the story that was told."
3,Oillars of the Earth,Read the book - great story - pity the film makers had to use their own creative writing. Otherwise very well done.
2,Bad DVDs,"This was a new product but two of the discs would not play properly. I have since heard that Sony DVDs often have this problem and I guess it's true. I am very disppointed in this product as I loved the miniseries, very well done, but the poor DVDs messed it up."
1,Pillars of the Earth (Blue-ray) A Bad Joke,"I've been around for many years and this is a first. Ordered ""Pillars of the Earth"" (Blu-ray). Much to my surprise when I opened the bad shrink wrapped case there were two (2) ""Memorex"" blank CD-R's. I'm wondering if this was a previous return where someone ripped off the two Blue-ray disks. Needless to say, I'm returning this for a replacement. Hopefully will have a more constructive review once I actually receive the proper disks.The Pillars of the Earth [Blu-ray]"
2,Very exciting but no a good moral of the story,"When I started to watch this miniserie I could help finish it in a few nights I wanted to know the end, sadly disappointment me.If you are the kind of person that likes to find a good moral of the story you will not like this. All the characters are evil even the 'good ones' do lie and cheat to archive their goals."
1,horrible,This was a horrible rendition of the book. The book was a modern day masterpiece. The film version is not even worth commenting on. Don't waste your money. We'll just pretend the film doesn't exist.
2,Good for a laugh,"If you have any interest in this story, read the book first! I think it's actually a really fast read, despite its length, and I am slightly dyslexic. The thing is that I've only seen the first episode, and I can already tell that the plot is quite chopped up, re-arranged, and butchered in the retelling. Also most of the acting leaves something to be desired. The sets, costuming and general art direction reek of fakeyness, and most of the characters are hollywood beautified. Just read the book, and maybe take a look at the miniseries later as kind of a fun jokey thing."
1,DVD does not work outside US,It would be a good idea to let purchasers from outside the US know that these DVDs are not compatible with their equipment.
1,Bleached teeth,"Why spend so much money on sets and costumes, and then show everyone in the 12th century with HOLLYWOOD BLEACHED TEETH???...Unwatchable!"
5,Love the series! this is my second copy as my paper shredder ate one of the disks from my first set.,this is my second copy as my paper shredder ate one of the disks from my first set. Glad to have it complete again!
2,pillars of the earth review,"have not seen complete series, but initial discs do poor job of outlining the story so characters and events can be understood. book made everything and everyone quite clear altho there were many characters and multiple events occuring."
5,A rough ride at times but very entertaining,"It's not as bloody and graphic as The Tudors but there are some rough spots at times that will be inappropriate for some potential viewers. The rest of us, however, can marvel at the production design and acting in this miniseries. I cannot compare it to the book since I have not yet read it.A large ensemble cast comes together in a portrayal of 12th century events in England, with both pure and corrupt priests, evil kings, struggling commoners, wars, and much more."
3,Just OK,"Scenery, costumes, actors very good; story moves too fast, disjointed; the book is much more interesting. The DVD is good to have for a collection."
3,Ok,I think the book was alot better. I appreciate the artistic nature of the this film but I wish they would have stayed more with the book.
4,Good - but liberties were taken,"It was a wonderful mini-series and since I don't get Showtime - I waited for the DVD. Actually loved watching it in quick succession. However, as much as they may have stayed true to the book - there was some changes made that I found disturbing. If you go to Wikopedia -they list the exceptions taken in the movie. I needed this since I read the book over 2 years ago - and thought maybe my memory was completely slipping."
2,A missed opportunity,"I haven't read the book, but having enjoyed The Tudors (the first two seasons anyway), I was looking forward to this series based on all the great reviews. Alas, I was quite disappointed. I don't know how closely the story holds to the book, but the failures of the series are almost entirely with the writing. The plot twists, which can be spotted a mile away, range from mildly annoying to outright absurd, and the characters' motivations are rarely fully (or sometimes even partly) justified. Political alliances and enmities often make no sense. The bad guys are so over-the-top bad as to be uninteresting. All of which is a shame, because the series has a lot going for it: terrific sets and costumes, a very good cast (especially Matthew Macfayden and Hayley Atwell), and the bones of a potentially engrossing story. Unfortunately, the series as a whole doesn't come close to that potential."
1,huge disappointment,"If the beginning reviews had not glowed I would not have wasted even six dollars on the first two discs.Read all the reviews. If you read Follet's book you may be very disappointed by the film which was a mockery of the novel. I realize that filmakers tend to embellish for dramatic impact but it was not necessary to do so with this story.The novel was so rich and dramatic that it needed no help at all. Staying true in every detail would have taken months of episodes but staying true to the story need not have been a stumbling block.As a matter of fact, the film inserted several dramatic scenes which never appeared in the book, wasted time which could have been devoted to the real story and was so fantastical that it was laughable. I will not watch the last disc as it is a waste of time.I am sorry that Follet praised the movie script, maybe,he saw it as a new story and based his opinion on that alone, because it did not do justice to his beautiful novel."
4,"The TV series is good, but the book is better","Early in the series, I was a 5-star fan, but I knocked off a star after there were a few deviations from the plot of the book. Obviously, nearly any book that's being converted to television/movie must be abbreviated or adapted in some way; Ken Follett's original work contained a lot of internal monologue that would have been difficult to translate to screen. The show's strengths are it's epic scale, incredible level of production (sets/costumes/etc.), and PERFECT cast. I honestly can't imagine anyone else as Prior Phillip, Jack, Aliena (although she took an episode to grow on me), Waleran Bigod, Remigius, or almost any other character. So, in summary:PROS:- Perfect cast- Amazing production design, locations/sets, costumes, etc.- Epic scaleCONS:-Plot differs from the book as the series goes onMy recommendation: enjoy the show for it's strengths, but do yourself a favor and READ THE BOOK. You will fall in love with this story and these characters!"
4,The Pillars of the Earth,It is one of my favorite books. I had read it 3 or 4 times. The DVD series follows pretty closely with the book. I enjoyed the Series
5,Review of DVD,The Pillars of the Earth was one of my favorite books so I was very happy that it became a mini series. It followed the book very closely and has a great cast.
2,Decent but far from the book,"If like me you're buying this after reading the book, prepare to be disappointed. It might be better to watch and then read."
1,Not Pillars,"Short and sweet. This adaptation is so different from the book, I'm not sue how Follett agreed to stand by it. I don't care how good McShane and Sutherland are. This is not Pillars."
1,Did not expect the crudeness,"I know this flick is not rated, but still ... My husband and I were looking for a movie at the local rental place and saw this. There wasn't any information on the box since it was just disc one of the set. We thought we'd give it a try and we're sorry we did.First episode was fine. A little violent but nothing to complain about.The second episode was a different story. All of a sudden you're bombarded by profanity, and I mean STRONG profanity (we're talking words that aren't allowed in R rated movies!). Not to mention a few scenes that were a little too graphic for us.So, I don't know much about the book and I didn't know anything about the series, but if you are looking for a story that doesn't make you cringe or reach for the fast-forward button, I would look elsewhere. The acting, from what we saw, was really good and we were just getting in to the plot. Sorry to the fans, I just didn't know what I was getting into!"
2,ALMOST what I ordered...,"Although it says blu-ray in the description, it isn't one. Which is upsetting because it is a gift for my father and I was very happy to get him a blu-ray. It took a while to get to me and what a shock when I see it's not a blu ray!"
1,pillars of the earth,read the book and was seriously disappointed in the TV series.It seems like the producers were trying to save money in not hiring children for the three youngsters at the beginning so thal left me cold. Ian Mc Shane is too short and fat for the role of Walerin and the lady who played Eiana is not that striking. I was not happy at all with the series and feel it could have been MUCH better
1,pillars of the earth,"I ordered this item as a gift for my girlfriend for Christmas. She was very excited to see it, as she had read the book and loved it! Much to our disappointment when we began to watch it, we saw that the frame rate was all screwed up.I'm not a tech nerd so I don't know why the disc's weren't being read properly. What I'm guessing is that every Other frame was being read instead of Every frame, I sent it back and ordered another set and had the same problem! It's obvious that there is a bad run or ""batch"" on the market and I am probably not the only one to have had this problem. My recomendation is to wait for a 2nd or 3rd run to be released before buying this series..."
1,Very Bad Recording,This is the worst video recording I have ever received from Amazon. The picture is grainy and the playback is extremely jerky. I couldn't believe this was a blue-ray recording. Too bad since I liked the series but will probably never watch this recording of it again.The Pillars of the Earth [Blu-ray]
5,great show,I read the book and love the show. stunning story line and visually breath taking story. I saw part of it on Encore but they never showed the whole thing Im glad i was able to find it at such a great price.
3,Not faithful to the book,"Pretty disappointed that it didn't follow the book more closely. Ken Follet himself says he's happy with the finished product and its changes from the book, but I was disappointed. The book is one of the best I've read, and perhaps expecting the movie/miniseries to compare was a little much."
3,Good,Where's the rest of it? I read the book and it was terrific! I was disappointed that the DVD ended before the book did.
5,Pillars of the Earth,This was a great movie to view. It is very long but engrossing. We have lent it to friends and they agree it is like a excellent book you can't put down. Highly recoomended.
4,Rated RRRRRRRRRR,"It is an interesting story, but there is too much bloodshed and sex scenes including a few rape scenes! It gave me nightmare for nights."
4,Excellent mini-series,"I had my reservations on a mini-series attempt at once of my favorite novels of all time. Starz knocks this one out the park. Cast, actors, acting, scenery, computer graphics are fantastic. This video series will not disappoint."
5,Pillars Of The Earth,"This is a fascinating look at the building of cathedrals in the 12th century. The book was fantastic and they managed to capture the very feel of this century with the sets, tools and costumes used along with a great screenplay. It was also fun to see the author in a cameo appearance as a shop keeper. It is an 8 hour miniseries - never boring!"
4,Well done -,"Many who read Follet's seminal work in the eighties have been awaiting the film adaption for quite some time. It doesn't disappoint. Replete with an all-star cast and amazing set designs, it is the epitome of all that the miniseries can be. Rufus Sewell gives a memorable performance as Tom Builder, as well as great work from Thomas McFadden, Haley Atwell and Donald Sutherland. But the true genius of the cast is Ian McSahne as bishop Waleran Bigod - who's deliciously evil embodiment will resonate with audiences long after they see the series. All in all, it is an excellent adaptation and though not better than the book (for what film adaptation ever is) it was a joy to watch. Now Follet fans can set their sites on the unofficial sequel - World Without End. Or better still, I would love to see Follet's latest phenomal work - Fall of Giants brought to the big screen. hope hope."
4,Pillars of the Earth DVD,The DVD was an adaptation of the book that actually clarifies some issues only implied in the book. A thoroughly enjo7yable retelling of the stories of the Anarchy period in English History and the building of a great cathedral.The Pillars of the Earth
2,Pillar Talk,"Lame adaptation of the beloved Ken Follett novel is redeemed only by Matthew Macfayden's performance as the persevering Brother Phillip. The usually reliable Ian McShane labors beneath risible hair and seems to give up on it all about midway through. Otherwise, a bunch a pretty, indistinguishable young actors sporting 21st Century orthodontia blunder about England, slaying and betraying. Thin mortar, this."
3,scratch this,"Great story. Kept our interest. However, there was a deep scratch that froze the picture around Episode 6 that caused us to have to skip some of that episode. How much we skipped I don't know. My rating of the company that sold it to us dropped from Excellent to a new rating of BELOW AVERAGE . They should have known better than to send a defective cd."
5,Can't wait,"This was one of my favorite books of all time. I loved it -sad that it is on Starz, too costly for us...but the cast looks amazing. Can't wait to get my hands on this DVD."
2,I wanted to like this miniseries...,"...but they left out so much of the plot just to put in lengthy violence. I've read the book twice and listened to the unabridged audio book three times. I don't remember it as a bloody, violent book. It was dramatic, moving and exciting, but this miniseries is just one hack and slash scene or general scene of suffering after another. And they even left out the part about the murder of Becket, one of the best scenes in the book. Disappointing."
2,Not the Book,"A loose adaptation of Ken Follet's novel that concerns the lives of various people involved in and around the building of the Kingsbridge Cathedral. Set against the backdrop of civil war in medieval England, the story includes elements that capture the violence and confusion of the times, including rape, murder, arson, war, and political intrigue.Despite its length (nearly 1000 pages) and minor imperfections, the book is far more worthy of your time."
5,A Classic telling of Classic novel,"The Pillars of the Earth has been one of my fovorite books of all time. I read or more correctly listened to it in 1995 and for years after when talking about great book with friedn this one always came up.I susccribed to STARZ on my cable just so I could see it.I have watched all of the episodes and once completed I wanted it to be released on DVD immediately so I could watch it again and to share it with friends who also have loved the book.The final two hour episode this past Friday Aug 27 was superb beyond wordsand the final scene summed it all up of what a wodnerful story this was and will be for a long time.If a Season 2 follows to the sequel ""A World without End"" then I will ready to watch it because if it anywhere near as good as the job done here then it will be something to look forward to very much"
5,Enthralling mini-series with superb acting,"Absolutely loved this mini-series and Ian McShane as a villanous character, so very different from his charming ""Lovejoy"" series. Set in the 1100s when treachery reigned supreme and wars to capture kindgdoms were the norm plus the era of the Crusades, some good characters come along whose only desire is to build magnificent cathedrals and sell there wares in an open marketplace. The sets, costumes, characters, acting, etc. are all first rate. Another struggle of the forces of Good and Evil set eons ago makes for royal entertainment."
3,Just OK,"Received the item in a timely manner.The first part was very convoluted and a little difficult to follow, after awhile you get sort of pulled into it.Of course the entire format is fight, build cathedral, fight,build cathedral.It's good for a rainy day when you have nothing else to do."
2,Not a great investment,Book does not have a lot of solid information a gardener can use. Lots of beautiful photos but not enough tips to succeed on creating a garden from seed.
2,Expensive Advice,"Other reviewers have commented that there is not enough information in this book to adequately prepare yourself for gardening from seed. I agree, and would like to add that Martha Stewart's advice advocates buying materials that you don't necessarily need. I do appreciate that she lists the pros and cons for different types of seedling containers, but she doesn't mention in that chapter that you can start seeds in recycled materials, like yogurt containers, cut-off milk containers, or egg cartons (for smaller seedlings).If you're looking for a more thorough book, see my review for Fresh Food from Small Spaces by R.J. Ruppenthal."
2,A poor reproduction of the original printing.,I sought to replace a previous copy that was purchased in 1981 from the original printer. This reproduction is poor at best. It seems that the photos and text were photo-copied: photos are grainy and washed; and the text print is not very easy on the eyes. I ended up returning the order for a refund.
4,Rottie dog,"The dog is much bigger than it looks in the picture, and is very lifelike. It even startled me when I left it in the car and then opened the car door. I jumped back thinking it was a real dog before I remembered it was my granddaughter's gift. I had her open the van door when I picked her up from school, and she also jumped back, thinking it was a real dog. Then her face lite up as she realized it was a toy dog and it was hers. She loves Rotties, and is very happy with it. It is a little hard to put it in a pose as the legs are quite stiff to move."
5,"Cute, realistic, loveable","After buying my baby this dog (we can't buy a real one), I am pleased with her reaction. She thinks it is real and calls it ""Nene"". She gives it hugs and kisses and tries to share her food and bottle with it. I may end up buying it a collar and food dish so she can learn about taking care of animals. In one photo, the dog is sitting down. Because of the durability and stiffness of the dog, this is not very easy to do. This toy is great quality and we look forward to many years of playing with ""Nene""."
5,Great for Training Staff and Dogs,"This toy has been great for training veterinary staff different types and restraint, as well as for use in training dogs."
5,wow,looks real. And is cute. i likie it more than some of my other toys because it is new and fun and has a lot of cool features. and is really furry and has good balance.
2,TILT,"This pool is easy to set up and fill ... BUT ... the thing won't stay upright. It starts to tilt almost immediately. Should an adult lean on the thing, or sit on the attached seat you're in real trouble.Great for kids, not so great for adults."
3,Seat didn't hold my weight.,"I bought this pool when my children were preschooler and toddler. I thought the seat was a nice feature, because I could get in and sit with them. The sides of the pool were high for them and my toddler couldn't get in and out by herself. The seat was very soft when fully inflated. It wouldn't hold my weight, which was about 125 pounds at the time. Since I couldn't comfortably sit in it, I just filled the pool with less water and let them splash in it. It was a good circumference for them at the time. They had plenty of room. The pool didn't last more than a season, but these pools don't usually last long anyway."
3,Need a new edition!!!!!!!!,"This is quite interesting as far as it goes but the title is misleading. This truly is a university or museum archivist's manual, not one for those in contemporary practices which also have avalanches of records needing care and handling. It's time for an update on this very important topic and I hope the scope will be broadened. I would like to see a couple of chapters on the current practical aspects of an ongoing design firm's liability issues with regards to keeping records and at least an outline on handling digital records. That would probably be an entire book on its own. Help!"
5,CCCCCOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!! BAND,Face to face live is definitly the best cd they have ever made. You must buy! Face to Face is the best band it always leaves you felling great and pumped! i glued this cd in my sterio and you should to its the best
5,The Tansu,A comprehensive history of the Tansu/dansu in the traditional Japanese society. It also give you some excellent examples of the varied uses for Tansu. It was lacking in the presentation of the Step Tansu which is very central to the Japanese History.
4,Great tansu reference,"An informative, interesting book on Japanese tansu at a price thats more affordable than some of the other out-of-print or premium reference books available on the market. Pictures show excellent examples. A good book for any tansu fan, beginner, expert. Recommended to any one interested in tansu's."
5,"A great present for most, especially elderly people","This was one of the best presents that I ever gave my elderly mother. It has kept her in touch with the members of her family who are scattered across three continents and bring them to her home. She loves it - once you have programmed it, it requires no maintenance, not turning on and off, nothing. It switches itself on automatically every day and displays anything up to 300 photographs in sequence or randomly. A great present. Only one small complaint - the device downloads images from a card onto its own rather limited menory in a rather unpredictable and uncontrollable fashion. I believe more recent models have fixed this problem. But don't let this put you off. You can give someone great pleasure by offering it to them."
1,Defective,"I bought this 12/3/06. Worked great; loved it until 2/07 when it suddenly went totally black and nothing worked. Tech support was no help. Took 2 months and about 3 hours on the phone to finally get a replacement. (Try getting a good customer service number for Philips; it's nearly impossible; all you get is the run around and people who will tell you anything to get you off the phone and then don't even apologize when they have outright lied to you) Finally got a replacement last month and it worked great...for 1 month then crashed for no apparent reason just as the first one did. Fortunately, I had saved the direct customer service number I had FINALLY gotten and called that directly. They SAY they will refund my full price (with the original receipt) in 3-4 weeks. I'm crossing my fingers. I see a bunch of these on Amazon selling as ""reconditioned"". My guess is these are the ones with the defect mine had and have been repaired. STAY AWAY FROM THEM."
4,Very Cool... a few improvements needed,"This is a very cool little toy, it is bright, clean looking, and impresses all the grandparents and friends ;)One thing I wish it had was a motion sensor so that it would only come on and turn off when the room was populated. I know it has a timer to do this but how do I know if I will be in a room the same time every day?!?!Another thing that would make it better is if it had a way to download pictures from the Internet as an option. I like the way it works now, it is perfect for me; but if I was going to give this to my mother then I would need it to do a wireless connection to her router and connect to the Internet for new pictures. For my mother in-law (who uses dialup) I would have to send her a few memory cards and teach her how to use it.The screen is great for me... but a few improvements would make it even better (I am going to figure out how to do a sensor on the power plug so that this works the way I want it to)!"
1,Misleading ad,"I just received this so called 7-inch picture frame and if it had been 7 inches, I probably would have been a little happier. If you read the print on the side of the box, the actual display size is only 6.5 inches diagonally (5.4"" x 3.6""). While half an inch does not seem like much, a 7 inch screen should be approximately 24 square inches. Having the screen 6.5 inches diagonal yields a little more than 19.4 sq inches for the display.I guess this will be going back.Update: Actually, I have to give this 3-4 stars. After looking at some of my photos on this, I decided that this was one nice device. The pictures are very crisp and bright. I did take the advice of one reviewer to download a program that will optimize the files for this device and I am quite pleased with everything.My initial comments regarding the screen size are still valid."
2,I expected better.,"I expected better from philips. First of all is you transfer many pictures the frame hangs. Secondly, the stand does not hold the frame stabe. The picture does not look good from all angles. Overall I was not satisfied with the product."
3,"Good product, but has a glitch","If you can deal with some trouble getting pictures to load, the end result is good. The reolution is good, the screen is bright, and it has some nice features like timed off and on. BUT - the picture loading software has a bug that causes it to hang if you try to load a series of pictures at once. This seems to happen with memory cards and direct download from a PC. I found that if you connect to your PC with the USB cable and drag and drop ONE file at a time, the bug can be avoided. Note that you must drop to the root directory (drop on the device name, not any file folder). Phone support for this product is a joke. A very cheerful representative read aloud all the stuff in the online manual, but had no knowledge of the product, computers, or digital pictures. Her final solution was to return the unit to Philips."
5,"Digital frame, Philips","Hit of our Christmas. Very easy to set up, in seconds. Picture clarity is great and program options are also great. All support documentation was excellent and product packaging was good. Had Christmas morning pictures programmed and playing as fast as we could take them! Highly recommended by all. My wife liked it so much she bought me one for the office and one for our mother in law!"
3,Rather Poor Directions,"The directions for this device are only on CD, and are not well written. Nowhere in the literature on the CD does it tell you which camera memory cards are compatable with the device. It will not accept the xD Picture Card used with Olympus cameras. I could not download from a memory stick, although the directions imply that should work. By accesing the device from my computer and finding that there is a ""Frame100"" file under the DCIM directory, I was able to drag-and-drop .jpg files from my computer to the device and then the device would display the pictures. This process is not described in the CD directions.The display is quite bright with a high resolution. However, I still have not figured out how to rotate a vertical photo to display properly when using the disply in the horizontal mode. The directions are pretty clear on how to do this, but I find they do not work.All in all, a good display device but the instructions need considerable work!"
4,Phillips Digital Picture Frame,Works and looks great. Very easy to use and load off of SD card. Recommend it highly compared to Tiga brand.
4,"A book for lovers of Franklin--Not a ""tooth fairy"" book","Franklin is upset when the tooth fairy visits his friends but not him. The book discribes a ""rite of passage"" for Franklin's deliema, not a tooth fairy story relating to an actual child's experience.As a first grade teacher, my children have enjoyed this book."
5,Am I Growing?,"Franklin doesn't understand why turtles don't have teeth. He thinks that is one way to know you are growing. Plus you get a present. He evens tries to give the tooth fairy a fake tooth. In the episode on tv they take Franklin for a checkup to show that he is growing. In the book, he gets a present."
4,Great Pictures! But the rhymes aren't complete,"This book is worth it just for the pictures--big, glorious, full-color pictures by one of the world's best illustrators. However, each page has just two lines per poem; I'm not sure why the entire poems weren't included (for instance, ""Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill came tumbling after"" is missing the first two lines!) There are ten poems, each with its own large, gorgeous picture. The last spread has some suggestions for activities that parents might do with their child. Examples: Hush-Bye-Baby suggests getting a library book that explains gravity, and thinking of other nursery rhymes that relate to gravity. Hot Cross Buns suggests visiting a website that has a recipe posted and making some yourself. Most of these seem beyond the toddlers that this book is geared for. I think the space would have been better used by including two more beautiful pictures and poems."
5,Fascinating window into L.M. Montgomery's life,"The difference between LMM's delightful work and her hard life never ceases to amaze me. This volume of her journals (the others are well worth it, too) highlights the changes in her life in her late years. During this period she wrote ""Mistress Pat"", ""Anne of Windy Poplars"" and ""A Tangled Web"" (among others); stories that are a little less idealistic, but the real-life situations have a bewitching ""tang"". The changes occuring in her personal life must have had an effect on her work. The aforementioned books weren't among my LMM favorites before I read this volume, but learning about her life during this period made me more appreciative of an author who was already my favorite. Who would have thought that reading a someone's personal journal could be so fascinating? I feel much gratitude towards her surviving family members for allowing her journals to be published."
5,Great read on a fascinating subject: moods,"I just couldn`t stop reading once I got started. Thayer`s concept of how and why moods occur is not only easy to understand but also absolutely plausible. So much so that I've tried out a few things and found they work. It doesn`t mean that I go on 5-minute brisk walks every time I feel low, but since now I know (most of the times) where that feeling comes from it seems a lot less disturbing."
3,Great content obscured by disorganized writing.,"If you dig hard, you can discover in this book that of the dozens of things people do to boost their energy, only four actually work (exercise, music, chores, social interaction). Similarly hidden in this book are four things that create a mood of calmness (meditation, yoga, massage, hot baths). The book would score an easy 10 if its factual message weren't randomly hidden in obscure sentences. The chapter headings, diagrams, and tables waste the reader's attention on speculative but wrong information. If Thayer writes a clear book, I'll buy dozens of copies and give it to all my friends"
2,Nothing but Common Sense,"I would suggest taking a pass on this book unless you are looking for evidence to support the common sense ideas that sleep and exercise will improve your mood. I didn't feel I had gained anything from reading this book. The ideas in the book can be summed up as: DON'T eat sugar, drink coffee, smoke, etc. DO exercise, eat healthy, etc. Nothing Earth shattering there.The author does provide lots of research and anecdotal evidence to support his claims, but I would compare this book to one written about how to control stress that covered the obvious things like not procrastinating, finding a balance between home and work, etc.Overall a disappointment."
3,Great value; terrible dubbing!,"Finally! Somebody in America releases these two early '90's films and on DVD at that! The plots of both the films are absurd, but so what? If you like G then you've got to see 'em both. I think neither of these films are as good as the as-yet-unleased-in-America G vs. Mechagodzilla (1993) but it's great to have them together with original Japanese trailers. One complaint: The dubbing is so bad that it often provides unintentional hilarity. It would be super if in the future, G DVD's provided access to subtitles. It would have made these films far more dramatically striking."
4,Godzilla - finally distributed in the US,I am happy these movies have made their way to the US and on DVD. They are definately worth having for any Godzilla fan!The only thing I wish they had put these in widescreen.Now if only G vs Biollante and Mechagodzilla would be put out on DVD.
2,Godzilla,"This is more a comment than a review.1. Many, many fans would like to see Godzilla in its original form - in Japanese w/subtitles & without Raymond Burr. Original title: Gojira.2. Many fans would like to see other Godzilla & monster movies in the original Japanese w/subtitles.3. For the price of a DVD, the customer should be given the option of Dubbing or Subtitling."
3,"Double Features, Yuck!!","Another double feature released by Tri-Star. Once more, the Japanese track isn't included, credits as well. A shame for two very good G-films. The menu is the DVD cover, surprise, surprise. Wait a second, all is not lost!! The DVD comes with the original Japanese trailer for both films! This saves the DVD from being a one-star, but still, Tri-star come on, you could of done better!!"
4,Godzilla in the 1990s - 2 of the better movies,"Godzilla vs King Ghidorah is to me the best of the 1990s Godzilla movies. A bit confusing with the time traveling and trying to rewrite Godzilla. The Effects are great. Godzilla is bigger than ever. Ghidorah is nothing like the 1960s in terms of voice or flying style (you cant bring back the 1960s) The score is excellent an update from the 1960s. Excellent Godzilla movie. Mecha Ghidorah is cool. There are a lot of twists and turns and which monster is the bad guy in this. Aside from the time traveling stuff which was a little hard to follow, this was a great film. The sequel is Godzilla vs Queen Mothra battle for the Earth which has the return of Mothra and the debut of Battra. Great SPFX, Mothra has new powers. Both start as larva and become moth monsters. Battra is like a dark Mothra. I found this to be enjoyable. The DVDs are full frame, and English dubbed,but who cares its Godzilla :) at least there is an official release of these 2 movies."
4,Heisai Value,"Getting two of the Heisai series in one package is a good bargain, though the time travel story of G vs KG is still something of a botch job, but the Big-G himself never looked better. If your going for all 28 G-films, this is a must have."
5,Godzilla vs King Ghidorah/ Godzilla Mothra BFE,I am going to reveiw both movies. Godzilla vs King Ghidorah: THIS MOVIE IZ AWESOME. This is one of my favorite godzilla movies and I haven't even seen them all ( I have only seen 9 and yes including the the tri star 1998 one too but that is still a good one )and this is one of the best godzilla ever after being hit by 2 nuclear subs his size doubled from 164 ft to 328 ft. Godzilla Mothra BFE: THIS MOVIE IS GOOD. The baby mothra in this movie looks better than the adult ( which looks like a giant puffball by the way ) but the movie makes up for it with the disasters and the fight scenes. P.S there are bonus monsters in each movie.
5,It was indeed a STONE BLAST!,"I purchased this DVD for my 70's birthday party. I had it playing on mute, for my guests viewing pleasure, while the rest of my guests danced and mingled. The people who were watching the dvd, while on mute, DID NOT MOVE from their seats! This DVD set was great. Great performances from the past. A great gift for you or someone else."
3,Promised so much but delivered so little,"In a nutshell, this is anything but ""the best"" of Soul Train.Sure, lot's of great performances, but so many superior performances left out and replaced with mediocre, relatively obscure performances.Repetitive Afro-sheen commericals, very few Soul Train line dances, and conspicuously left out legendary performances from The Temptations, The Four Tops, The Sylvers, Aretha, Gladys Knight, The Ojays, Al Green, Supremes, Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, Stevie, etc, etc . Perhaps 20% of what it could/should have been. Please, please somebody release ALL Soul train episodes in their entirety."
4,Come on watch the Train!,"Despite what some reviews say, this collection is highly enjoyable. There are Soul Train dance lines, commercials from back in the day, and a lot of great performances from some of the greatest soul singers. See the jackson 5 with Randy after their peak years perform I Want You Back, and songs from Lookin' Through The Windows, plus a solo performance from Jermaine. Many performances are lip synced, but some seem to be live performances such as Barry White and Sly & the Family Stone. It might have been better if it did not include the opening every time a new episode starts or if it was in chronological order. It's great to see the dancers and the performers, including James Brown."
3,very disappointing,this 3 DVD set was very disappointing. i like 2 see the full show with the Dancers and the dancers dancing in a line. someone needs to come out with the full shows not just half a the show like time life did. i rather record it on Centric. i never buy any thing like this from time life again. if i knew time life did this i would not have brought it from some else on Amazon.
2,Good . . . But . . .,"I was expecting more performances . . . but instead we also have the show introduction almost before and after every performance, it even included commercials. Good memories anyway and good interviews, good interaction with the public as well. Sound quality is just stereo, picture quality is good. If you are a collector of soul music, then is a good buy."
2,Half and Half ??,"While i would be the first to say anything bad about Soul Train as it was and still is one of the best entertainment shows all around,I must say that this 3DVD pk was not put together in a way to show case the artists that was introduced, Don Cornelius wouldcall a group's name but they were not on the DVD,all that could have been edited out.The interviews from the dancers was too long andsome to far out. We know all stars could not be in the pkg but single DVD of various artist have cost less and was a lot better."
3,Could be better but not bad,"This is a good collection but i would have liked it better if it had less popular artists and more people like Johnny Nash who sings ""I can see clearly now"" for example. And it's true that there are too many Affro Sheen commercials but at least you can skip them with your DVD remote. I found that i liked the 6th DVD better than the rest. This collection didn't blow my mind but it's quite enjoyable nonetheless."
2,NOT THE FULL EPISODES...,Just featured performances from the show...you're lucky if you run into a Soul Train line or a regular dance sequence from the show. I'd rather DVR a full episode on Centric! Very disappointed.
5,Awesome,"I received this set for Christmas, This is an awesome collection and will recommend it to anyone who love music and artist from the 70's, It does put a lot of focus on the performances and a lil on the dancers, but this is how this collection should be, You will never see artist like The Isley Brothers, Kool and the Gang, The Ohio Players, Barry White, Luther Vandross, Teddy Pendergrass and more on stage again, it has a right amount of time dedicated to the dancers and the afro sheen commercials..Christmas Day and we sat around all day watching the DVDs and everyone love them and a few of them went on line and ordered the collection while at my house.Can't wait tile they come out with the 80's Edition"
3,Compared to Newer Single and 3 DVD Set,Would be nice if somebody compared this to the newer Single and 3 DVD sets i.e. are all the performances on the newer disks already on this 9 DVD Set?
4,This book is great for all ages,"Myke Feinman, who has made an international reputation as a cartoonist, has turned his talents to writing a novel that all ages will like. From his legendary hidden lair on the lower east side of Streator, he has penned a novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and will keep your sides splitting from laughter. That's because it's hard to sit on the edge of a seat while your sides are splitting. This may be the best book about alien teddy bears from outer space invading the earth that has been written in 2004. It's frightening yet delightful,horrifying yet funny. His son, Anthony Feinman, an accomplished cartoonist in his own right, is listed as co-author. Yet it is the teddy bears who are the subjects of this book who are the real authors; I got this on good advice from a sci-fi website run by a guy in a comic book hero costume at the Chicago Comic-Con, and those guys have a code so you know it's true. Anyway, buy this book. You won't be disappointed."
2,Does not perform as advertised for Persians,"I was looking for something to add a little lift to my Persian's coat for show. The product states it will not build up; it will feel natural, touchable, and supple; it will not be tacky... You could definitely feel it in the hair, and it was in fact tacky, even after being completely dry. Even with the lightest hand, and only applied at the base of the hair it did not feel good and natural. I didn't feel like I got a whole lot of volume or lift by using it, either.That said, I have not found a leave in bodifier yet that I didn't notice. This spray DOES leave the hair very shiny, and it was a little better than sprays designed for humans. it could be very useful for other applications, just not Persians.I guess I was hoping for a miracle, I do like most of the CC stuff!=^..^="
3,Pink Diva,"This item was not used a lot because my daughter misplaced the key. Even though we realized that a magnet would still open the booklet; my 10 year old was too embarrassed to use a magnet in front of her friends. Very nice product, but the key is key!"
4,"Not the best, but good none the less","I felt that this was the worst of the BOTI series to date. The plot was good, but brief, and the new cast members were fun. The problem I had was Rin. While she has always been a little slow to catch on to the real world, she seemed almost dumb to it in this book, as if she could not handle the real world. After watching her slowly wake up in the previous episodes, that was a draw back."
3,"Good pictures, but does not hold up","This is a cute little book for very little hands. The bugs are fanciful but still real. Unfortunately, it has a total of about 7 pages and the bugs will soon leave them. These pop ups mostly come out of the page centers, and are easily torn off -- even by very young babies. This is a good book for a stocking stuffer or to tie on a present, but it won't last."
3,Just putt order in!!,I hope they wrk for me but some people say it didn't wrk for dem but sometimes things dont wrk on everybody but will c for me
1,I actually shrunk!,"I have been taking Breast Success religiously for over five months and have not grown at all! In fact, I have actually shrunk a bit since starting these! I am a 32A so not being able to fill my tiny bra anymore is disturbing. Waste of money! Don't get your hopes up!"
2,Don't know if it works,"I had to stop taking this product within a couple of days because it gave me horrible, painful gas! I am also taking a green tea supplement with caffeine in it, and since they recommend that you stay away from caffeine for these products to be effective, I am going to try again after I am finished with my weight loss program... with lots of Bean-o."
3,funciona?,"Es mi primera semana, si siento como que alguna comezoncita en el area de mis pechos, los siento raros, a ver que pasa en la segunda semana, estare actualizandolo cada semana o dos para ver si en realidad funciona. XOXO"
5,"Well, it does work!","This product works however I suspect to get more permanent results it has to betaken for longer than a month. It is primarily herbs though that you can getthrough herbal supplement suppliers much more inexpensively and get the same resultsor so I have discovered. The main ingredients which are saw palmetto and fenugreekcan definitely give you results! While I liked the supplement very much, I found thatjust buying the herbs and taking the supplements to be every bit as effective and a lot better buy for the money, however if your looking for the results and the convienence this is definitely a five star product par excellance!"
3,seemed to work at first,"I purchased 3 bottles and it seemed to work immediately. My breasts were heavier, fuller and obviously bigger within 3 weeks. However, results didn't seem progressive. I completed my 3 months supply. But my breast started to shrink back to how they were originally within days of not taking breast success. So I discovered 3 facts about the product: my breasts did grow but only temporarily with no lasting results, my sex drive went up the roof (also temporarily), and it caused my face to break out (which was a total deal breaker for me)."
1,seller makes fake accounts,Does not work :/ not for me anyway. Don't listen to the fake reviews on here you'll regret it... i sure did.
2,nothing!!,"i tried it for over 3 months, the first few weeks, i did felt a tingling on my nipples, but that was it, few days latter the feelings were gone, after i was done wt my supply there was no change in my breast measurement. not at all"
2,Didn't work,"I used this product for 2 months. The only difference I saw in my breast was that they were more round. They didn't increase in size.Other things I did notice:-Made me more sleepy-Calmed me down when I felt anxious-Killed my sex drive-Didn't mess up my menstrual cycleI stayed away from caffeine, chocolate, fats, teas, exercised less. I did everything the way I was suppose to. Yet, no growth.I have had more success with the Noogleberry Breast Pump. I've been using it for a year and went from a small A to a big B."
3,1 month,So far iv'e been taking bs for a month.They are slightly fuller now but i have yet to see any noticible change.I will continue taking them till the 5th or 6th month and really hope it works =]
1,Absolutely No Results,"I've been taking this pill for 5 months now. For the first 3 months I took it exactly how it said with absolutely no results, so I doubled to the dose the last two months...still nothing. The official website said that most women get full results by 6 months, so I'm thinking I won't see any change. Total waste of money and time, don't even bother."
3,this was ok,This product works well but not the best if you need a product like this one look around first and you will find the right one for you. The company that sells this product is very well stocked of some of the best products for your needs but this one is not one that I would use again but it might be the one for you.
5,Excellent!,"The product arrived ahead of ETA, well packaged.Installation for a Jeep Grand Cherokee took about 5 mins, literally. The support arms work great, really strong, even in freezing temperatures, no issues at all. No complaints so far. Recommend."
5,Ten Minutes Well Spent,"After about 10 years, the tailgate window on my 2002 Grand Cherokee had a nasty habit of whacking you on the head when you least expected it. Two of these replacement supports fixed that problem in about 10 minutes.I replaced these without any help, but there was still enough ""oomph"" in the old supports to hold most of the weight of the window, so it was pretty easy. The hardest part was digging out the collection of Torx bits from the barn. Not sure of the size, but it used the largest bit in my collection.A little dab of penetrating oil on the screw seemed to make life much easier. The replacement strut had a clip assembly on the top mount, which made installation even easier. No need to disassemble the clip, it just snaps right on. You can do it with one hand, allowing you to support the glass with your other hand.If you can operate a Torx driver, you can do this.Only negative- I shouldn't have waited so long."
3,Okay,"When I bought this book, I thought that I was going to learn about advancing my career further. Instead, the advancing is just a reminiscing on the concepts that I already know and use at work."
5,Updating your Career Path,"This book is a must for every person who wants to stay current and move ahead in the area of nursing. Looking for the current ""buzz words""? They are here. Definitely worth your time and money."
5,The sum of all my fears.....,".......great soundtrack for sure...this is a generation x movie led by Ben Affleck....I liked the movie though...he looked so funny with his NOFX albums and posters all over the room,and gibberishing some Bouncing Souls song....all that is great l..the only bad thing was that sorry movie...the sum of all fears....where he acted totally wrong....being a slave of the country instead of making fun of it like all good punkers....nice album anyway..."
4,Question......,"The song at the end of the movie was called ""Acetone"" and i cannot find it ANYWHERE....it's by Mudhoney....does anyone know where i can find it?? If so, please email me at BENZ007@aol.com Thanks Alot!"
5,CD evocation,"As a new student of classical guitar, I was really caught up in the way Karin brings out her personality in her music. I would recomend this CD to everyone."
4,nostalgia,"this toy brought back memories for those who had one of these when they were a child, to see the next generation having the same joys and expereiences as them is wonderful. my niece loved this from the get go. she recognised that it was a monkey, her eyes light up when it started clapping, she even experiemented with the clapper to see if she can stop it form clapping by putting her hands between them. or to see if it will hurt i could not tell. she was experimenting. she has fun with it up to today.great product, durable and reasonably priced, delivered promptly"
1,magic toy monkey,toy is not for young children. Got it for christmas. Slapping his hands together just didn't make it to the next day
3,monkey,"I wish it would stop automatically after some time. It gets annoying. Otherwise its ok. If your child likes noise making toys, you can try this one ."
4,Great Gift,"This was a going away gift for a coworker, and was perfect for the occasion. It comes exactly as it looks. Arms move, cymbals make noise. If you're looking for ""old fashioned charm"" without scouring antique stores for something that still works, this is a great alternative."
3,OK,"Even though the description of the product doesn't match the actual product received, it is OK. It doesn't jump or do any such sort. But it just makes a creeking sound and bangs the hands which attracts my baby."
1,piece of crap,"do not buy this piece of crap, cymbals in hands do not clap!!!!! just kinda jumps up and down then chirps (like a bird) - big big disappointment"
4,Made the BF very happy,The BF mentioned this toy while reminiscing about childhood and a TV show. Got it for him as a surprise and he loved it.
5,A Page Turner!,I couldn't put this book down! Highly relevant to current issues and full of suspense and action.
1,Caution,"I want to caution anyone looking for ""Mythic"" there are two groups with the same name. ""Morning In The Winter Solstice"" is a heavy metal group starring Dana Duffy. This recording is a Rap group not to be confused with the metal one."
5,"Great Taste, Fun to Collect, Hugh bubble!","Both my brother and I love these gums. Its taste lasts much longer than Bubblicious bubble gum. It tastes much much better than dubble bubble, which has a chalk taste when you just put in mouth. We used to like to buy Bazooka gum and collet its wrappers, but Bazooka gum is so hard to chew, always feel like stalled, we have to very careful with our teeth, special my brother's loose tooth..But these Tottoo gum are so much softer and easy to chew, we can easily blow a hugh bubble with them. It also has a fun wrapper with tatto. We already collect over 30 different kinds!"
5,"Well, it tastes good...","I bought this because I was curious about the flavor of coca leaf and its stimulant effectsIt tastes pretty good, as a tea it just sorta makes a grassy tasting tea similar to alfalfa tea, if a bit sweeter.Can't say it does any stimulating or invigorating but it's quite delicious and it was a treat to get to taste this uncommon tea.."
5,tasty,The fresh taste and smell was really unique you don't find in other teas. Although you can easily sip this delicious tea through the day because it has none of the negative effects of coffee and caffeine you will find that it will benefit you no more than drinking 2 or 3 cups. The only downside is the steep price which isn't too bad once you realize that this tea is more of a health supplement than just another beverage. Great healthy alternative to caffeine. This tea has been consumed responsibly in Latin America for millennia and only now are we starting to realize its great health benefits
1,Wonderful Saumell and Cervantes-Horrific Lecuona,"This CD presents a Cuban pianist playing Cuban music. One would assume deep understanding of styles, and conception. However, such is not the case 100% unfortunately with all the music here. Spengler plays beautiful Saumell, nice Cervantes (though not as good as some other Cuban pianists). The Lecuona however I must say, is some of the WORST playing committed to disk of these pieces. I am embarrased as a Cuban, that one of our own should not understand Lecuona's music, style, and forms better.Still the Saumell is really wonderful. Buy the disk for this music. However, Listen to Nohema Fernandez or Frank Fernandez Play Cervantes in their recordings for peerless interpretations of these works, who are also Cuban pianists.For Lecuona, once again-there is no competition in my opinion-get Tirino's complete series on the BIS label (who started the revival of Lecuona's music these days) and also get Lecuona's own recordings as a point of reference."
4,good but not awesome,"this is not stephen r. davis's best work, it just skims over windows programming, if you have a copy of MSDN, good beacuse your gonna need it. it covers MFC but that part isn't very helpful. there is alot of very help full information in there (i can program in windows now).BTW: the first example is missing a line wndClass.Size = sizeof(WNDCLASSEX); it won't compile without it."
1,This book title fits...,I initially bought this book for a friend but then used a couple of times for reference when the person I leant it to asked questions... After a couple of times reading sections I quickly noticed a style in the author I had seen before. Not realizing it was an author I had read before and swore I never would buy a book from again I missed it... but here he is again parading through the book like he is some programming genius and you are some idiot who should not be learning to program in the first place. The book title fits the way he treats his reader... I found his technique to be even more insulting and arrogant.
4,Refreshing,Personally think this is pleasant and refreshing. There is something here for everybody. I do think if you are really looking you would definitely be able to find it here. Thank you so much and keep up the great work.
3,Valuable,I found this publication to be very useful. The information presented is clear and well organized. As an experienced web surfer I found businesses in the directory that I had not found anywhere else. I recommend the directory as a reference guide to ethnic merchandise. I only wish it were larger.
1,Disappointed with this meager booklet,"If you are looking for a pretty concise listing of African and African American products go to the Internet and use a search engine, you will find more sources. This is a very small booklet with very few entries. I am very disappointed with this booklet. Ms. Kane has the right idea, this is something we need only more of it."
3,Not what yout think,This is not the Frank of the 11 Leahys that do CALL TO THE DANCE.But it ok fiddle music.
3,just one girls point of view,"I liked this book a lot. My mother and I read it during our free time and I think it was worth the trudge through the boring parts to get to the times when the stories were absolutely fascinating.Glover told about History, Recipes and many other things. I especially loved it when he would speak of his meetings with friends."
4,Back to Love,"BACK TO LOVE is one of my favorite Hed Kandi compilations. It takes club hits from the late 80s to the early 90s and has them unmixed on two discs. This edition happens to be one of my favorites in the collection. Disc one focuses more on the club hits. Highlights include Todd Terry's ""Weekend"", Slave to the Vibe's 12"" mix of ""Aftershock"", Ann Consuelo's ""Save The day"" (Stonebridge remix), and more. Disc two is more hip hop driven. Not as good as the first disc but it still has its moments. Overall a great collection that will bring you back in time and make you smile."
3,A little too open ended,"I bought this book for my 7 year old son. For the most part, we both enjoyed the book. But the ending was just a little too free to interpretation for my liking. I like the ending to be final for kids. They make up their own endings that are a lot more frightening to them."
5,A window into Chinese culture!,"If you want to find out the real story of Mulan and other Chinese tales, then this book is for you!"
2,Not what I want,"First I thought this book tell about the traditional tales of chinese.Endup I was wrong, and quickly returned this book.I find this book tell more about China history, and all in summary. SO, the story would a bit off for you if you totally do know anything about Chinese stories.."
3,Dissappointing,"It had a few things worth reading but not much. My interest is Jewish fiction of the type poblished free and complete online. My own for instance, [...]"
3,Neat invention and works properly but doesn't last very long,Item worked well but didn't last very long. I used it to hold a ladder on a truck rack and in about two weeks time the internal wire snapped and rendered it useless. I liked the way it worked and how secure the product held but it just works better to hold items that do not have to be constantly removed and secured multiple times in a day.
3,Nothing Fancy; It Works Fine (That is until you try shutting down),"I am E. Ridenour, Former CCNA, MCP, A+/Server+/Net+, APSx2(Compaq) and some other ones I forget. Anyways, I'm an Expert (I know silicon baby!), I replaced my previous GigaB Mobo because I D/X'd it as @Busted@ (you know). I replaced it with this Intel. No OC capabilities to be had, I knew that b4 I bought it, I slapped it all together, it booted right up no probs, but then when I goto shutdown for one thing the comp doesn't switch off auto like it used to (no matter which Bios/Windows setting I played with) and even worse if it did decide to turn off it would after about 2 mins of spinning, then it would go off for 3 seconds then come right back on again!! Yes, I tried every tech trick under the sun, even did a few dances to appease the Silicon Higher-Ups :>) I checked up and down the Net and this and many similar derivatives are indeed a problem at large in the community. That said, for the $$, I recommend this board.-EDR"
1,Damaged Product,"The first calendar was sealed with scotch tape on one side and was basically opened. It came crushed and bent, and was missing the pen. The box seemed old. It was in such poor condition that I had to return it.The replacement calendar came in a new box, but was again bent and wrinkled. I was so disillusioned at this point that I did not even return it."
1,the Beginning of a Bad Legacy; THIS ALBUM SUCKS!,"Not a single one of these songs has anything with any redemptive quality. Frankly, it is genuinely disgusting to fathom what began to pass for punk rock during the 1990's, as many of those bands (such as Blink 182) sound nothing like the old school bands. Punk rock died after the late 80's, and these newer bands are an insult to its great legacy. To all fans of New School Punk: do yourselves a favor and pick up the 1976 classic the Damned Damned Damned-- that's punk rock! Also, don't stop there; read up on the history of punk rock and continue on with the Ramones, Sex Pistols, Dead Kennedys, and Crass. As was mentioned before, this album sucks."
5,"Punk-pop- oh, whoops.... JUST STRAIGHT PUNK!","Great cd. Love every song. Fentoozler is really good and its a little smoother than Chesire's Cat's. Carousel is good, and this is also the better version of it. Case in point, this is punk rock at its finest. They've gotten more pop, granted but go ahead and check out their other albums. It's not as good as this in any way shape or form, but Enema of The State comes close. God Bless Musicians, George Bush and Johnny Ramone."
3,Not The Best,"The first Blink 182 c.d. isn't there best. some vocals sound just horrible, but some sound great. If your a die-hard Blink 182 fan you should get this c.d. if not you might want to listen to it first."
3,early blink,"this album was just a montage of blink in their early days. i think that they showed more musicianship here than in their later works. the sound quality however cancels out everything else. s lot of these songs are featured on ""Cheshire Cat."""
5,Buy this CD!,"Well, Blink 182 is a great band, i love their new and old music, this CD along with Chesire Cat, are really good. Its just such sketchy punk rock, its a lot different from the new albums but its great. Tom's singing is so off key it makes it more fun to listen to, but i think Mark's singing is great. Scott isnt as good a drummer as Travis (new drummer) but it makes the music sound more punk. Anyway if you like any of the other Blink CD's check this one out, its got some great songs that they dont play on tour that most people probably havent heard. If you like this CD definately pick up Chesire Cat, and Dude Ranch. If you dont like it just check out their new stuff like Enema of the State, Mark Tom and Travis Show, and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket..."
2,Not the best,"This would have been a whole lot better if there was better recording, and if they waited until Mark was better. There are some great songs on this though. Some of them are: Carousel, Point of View, and the Girl Next Door. It is kind of funny to see how goofy they looked in their older days."
5,The Best Blink-182 cd,"This cd is awesome. This is the best blink-182 cd ever. Songs like t.v., point of view, time, and 21 days is why this cd is the best. Buy this cd if you like good music."
3,good but not Blink's best...,"I baught this c.d. expecting to hear good punk rock songs which I did but they weren't as good as other recordings I've heard of them. The #1 reason it wasn't as good as their others is that Mark was sick when they recorded it so the vocals are...but in the song ""Girl Next Door"" Mark rocks. The songs are good but if you're expecting to hear good all around then I suggest to think about their other recordings. I think the best song is ""Carousel"" although the vocals are... (like i said before.) Well I geuss that's all I can say about the c.d. Buddha."
3,Worst Blink 182 cd,"This is probably the worst cd from Blink 182. If you like them only for their All the Small things stuff, this isnt for you. It is decent though. It's basically a good garage band cd. If you don't like it, then it's not for you."
4,The old Blink is just as awsome as the new Blink,"Blink 182 is awsome and even though in 95' they werent as good they are now but they are still the best band in the whole world. Buddha has some great songs. It has my altime favorite Blink song on it, Carousel. That song is awsome. And even though Travis kicks a** Scott is kewl too."
5,blink 182 the best band,"Buddha should really be considered to be Blink-182's debut album instead of Cheshire Cat. Although, buddha may sound only like a demo album, however, many of its songs contain very formal musical structure which don't sound like a demo at all. It's arguably the best album of Blink-182"
2,Interesting album,"This album sounds just like Enema of the State...It also sounds like Take of your pants...In fact it sounds like all their albums, because they all sound the same. The only thing different about this album is they don't have synthisised foices and mark actually plays good bass parts in this."
1,Nothing more than noise,"Completely pathetic. Not only does Blink 182 have nothing to say, they would lack the musical skill to say it even if they did. A friend of mine once defended it - ""C'mon, it's punk music."" Is that an excuse for it being bad music? Their drummer seriously needs to learn to depart from the one rhythm that he appears to know - the constant 1-2-1-2-1-2 beat present in EVERY LAST ONE of their songs. The guitar, bass, and drums always blend together into a rhythmless noise - the first trick in the book to hide the fact that you don't know how to play your intruments. As they demonstrate in every song on the cd, they have nothing to sing about and their popularity rests entirely on their shock value and obnoxiousness, a sure-fire strategy for roping in my fellow teenage boys."
1,this sucks,"this cd sucks hardcore, the first song is the only good one everyother song the guys voice gets so annoying you want to shoot yourself. if you like their more recent recordings don't buy this one."
2,Their early stuff. Not that good.,"Blink 182 is by all means a great band, but their early work such as Buddha, isn't that great. It seems more like random themed songs without any passion than the hard rocking tunes they have made in albums like Enema of the State."
3,Blink182's worst CD,"This CD is basically a [cruddy] version of Cheshire Cat. A LOT of these songs were already on Cheshire Cat. The songs that are not on Cheshire Cat aren't really all they great either. They are EXTREMELY mellow. I am sorry but Enema of the State sounds a lot more like punk than those songs do. To someone that doesn't have Cheshire Cat it would be fine, but if you have Cheshire Cat then only buy this CD if you are a die hard Blink fan like me and wants ALL the CDs. Actually ANYBODY that is not a die Hard Blink fan then just buy Cheshire Cat and skip this one. You will be happy you did."
1,It would be good if I was looking for pop rock,"Who ever calls this classic punk rock has got something wrong with them. If you're looking for classic punk rock than try the U.S. bombs, or Swingin' Utters. I'm sick of all of these little radio kids running around saying ""Oh Blink 182, Yea the're punk. i heard they were the first true punk band ever. Yea I have third eye blind, eve 6. They are punk also."" This CD would get five stars for classic radio pop rock, but as far as punk goes, this cd crashed and burned. Now if I were reviewing Enema of the State, by b-182, this would be a much more hostile lecture. Blink 182 sold out, and there is nothing else i can say. and for those of you who think you are blink fans, I have two words Cheshire Cat. If you have any comments for me, please email me."
4,Blink182 Rules!,"I am huge Blink182 Fan. I love Blink182, and I think they are the best. Even though I really love their music, this CD was not the best. It had great tunes like, ""TV,"" and ""Time,"" but I think Enema Of The State is better.If you really like more punkish kind, get Enema! That is total punk! Blink182 did better since they weren't recoeding in Tom's garage. But still this CD is off the hook, and if you a Blink fan, or need some new tunes to listen to, buy Buhdda and all the other CDs."
2,Don't waste your money,"This CD is basically Dude Ranch with lower quality. There are only one or two additional songs, so why waste your time and money? Go out and buy Dude Ranch instead."
3,i thought it would be better,i have been a fan of blink for a long time and this defently isnt there best. it would have been a lot better if they did it in a music studio then a garage. also that mark sounds kind of annoying because his voice. cheiser cat was a lot better. cause in cheiser cat they did it in a recording studio and mark was not sick. so if u dont have cheiser cat and ar thinking about getting this. GET CHEISER CAT FIRST. BEILEVE ME
3,Not good.,"The swear words aren't the bad part. Its the music and especially the vocals. Blink 182 was a new punk band though. They just had no experience. Well, look at 'em now! Awesome! Why did they have to break up? I reccommend any Green Day, Weezer, BoDeans, and any other blink except maybe "":cheshire cat"" and ""Flyswatter"""
4,"This is a good CD, not their best, but it's good","This is a treasure to have, since it's fun to see what Blink sounded like earlier in their careers, but they should have postponed the recording session until Mark was feeling well, because his voice sounds really distorted. Had they waited a week until Mark's condition cleared up, this could have been a 5-star CD. Other than that, it's a great CD with classic songs (early versions of ""Cheshire Cat"" favorites) but they should have thrown in the 2 songs on the original demo tape: early versions of ""Degenerate"" and ""Lemmings""... If you liked ""Cheshire Cat"" then you'll appreciate this. If you're a new fan (Enema of the State) you may be in for a huge surprise, as this sounds nothing like them. SO basically what I'm saying is this is more ""Cheshire Cat"" than ""Dude Ranch"" and ""Enema..."" You'll have to appreciate Tom's whiny, scratchy punk voice to appreciate this CD.... if not, you need not apply."
4,Straight Up Blink,"I wouldnt say this is Blink at there best, but it still is good and fun to listen to. Like most there albums it has the usual Blink trade marks such as catchy guitar riffs and chorus's (dont know how to pluralize that) along with immature lyrics. But what makes this album speacial is the fact that this is pure blink 182. No studio magic at all. Another thing that makes the album fun to listen to is Tom's young and not so innocent voice. This is definately a good album."
2,Blink 182 is one of my fav. bands but.........,i know i know they did this like 6 weeks/months after they got together but it still isn't that great but i still give them lots of credit. IM me at go69ess is you want.
3,Very old Blink.,This was Blink-182's first full length album. Releast in 1995 yull find very old songs that are on some of there resent albums like the song Carousel. And yull also notice that the boy's sound really young (tom mostly) but if your addicted to blink-182 this is a must have.
1,Blower.,"I am a huge Blink fan. However I must admit, Buddha REALLY blew the big one, HARD. It DOES sound like it was recorded in a metal box. And there is no stucture to a single song. You should, however buy Dude Ranch."
2,pirate copy??,"Vitas is a brilliant singer & the songs inside this CD are very good.But I think it's a pirate copy.The covering pages are very simple. The color changed a lot . It's reddened.(check with Vitas official website please)It's different from the original one.When I played it in the computer ,no name of CD & songs shown ....only unknown CD & track 1,2,3...(I got another Vitas CD, there are name of CD & songs shown in the computer in Russian language)It's not fair to get pirate copy here.Why did Amazon.com allow such business?I 've written this review once and it's missing the next day.I don't know why. So I do it again.BTW, it's a very good CD if I 've got a true copy."
1,Better try it with its follower game,"I accept bad graphics when the strategic aspect is well. However, the graphics of this game are just too bad. Furthermore, the entire game design of its follower, space empires 5, is more appealing.I would strongly recommend anyone to test the demos (for se iv whether the graphic is sufficient and for se 5 whether it functions probably (some windows 7 and vista computers have problems))."
1,Another rip off.,"Just another rip off. Ever since the company got greedy and screwed it's long standing fan base of shareware companies their ego and greed seem to have gone up while their ability to innovate seems to have gone down even faster.The old space empires was solid and had good ideas and expandability, since then all these guys do is put out also rans."
1,Horrible!,"I agree with the majority here, save your time and money and get one of the other series, NOT this one. The casting is horrible and the man that is supposed to be the leader of the family is a wife-fearing wimp and should be embarassed for the rest of his life to have acted like this. The people that chose these individuals should have reconsidered their choices. I, personally, would have loved to have the opportunity to participate in something like this, however watching these people make me wonder. If the real people back then had acted like this you can believe the the whole history of the united states would have been different (and not for the best)."
3,"Whiners, bitchers and moaners","Once again, PBS lets another exciting ""House"" premise get trampled on by the time travellers. It happened before in Frontier House and again here in Texas Ranch House. Some participants refused to accept the premise of living life as it was in 1867 and instead insisted on bringing 2005 sensibilities into play. The worst was Mrs. Cooke, who constantly bitched and moaned about how little women are respected. Wake up and smell the coffee, Mrs. Cooke, it's 1867 not 2005.The cowboys were whiners too, but at least they acted like men of the period. I kept thinking of how much better the British versions of ""House"" shows were. (1900 House, 1940 House)"
2,Disappointed,"I have thoroughly enjoyed PBS' prior ""Houses"" and have learned a lot about the times and customs. However, I wonder, after this one, how PBS vets their participants. It's always interesting to watch the dynamics between people, however, the only dynamics I could see here were so many negatives...lots of bitching, whining, bickering. Doesn't PBS tell their participants what its' going to be like? I'm getting tired of whining and cheating. It's interesting to me that of these types of series, Frontier House had two families who, at least, tried to live the life as authentically as possible. I wish I had rented this on Netflix first. I would not have spent the money to have it in my permanent collection."
3,Worth the watch,I've enjoyed the show but I'm so sorry for the poor women on this show. They really made themselves look like idiots. Check out Colonial House.
3,Time for a new edition,"I've lived in Alaska 21 years and found this a frustrating book. It was chocked full of information, but uneven. Although a second edition, it was rife with pathetic typos and mispelled names. The authors deal in authoritative (perhaps excruciating) detail with political haggling for landmark rulings such as the Native land claims and authorization of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Yet they omit any reference to arts, wildlife management or the way people's living conditions have changed. As examples of this patchy approach, they tell us exactly how many barrels of oil various wells produced in their early years, but never tell us how many Alaskans died in the 1964 earthquake. Also, the second edition is now sadly dated. This is a useful book, but it is about the Alaska of the politicians and fails to convey a sense of The Great Land and its pioneers."
2,The Dancer Takes Photos,"Eddie Murphy sings; Jamie Foxx plays piano; Bette Midler acts: many artists dabble in more than one genre. Here, the late Arnie Zane presents photographs. This book is really for Zane-Jones fans more than other people. It would make for a risque coffee table book. The photos of Zane with Jones don't appear until the end. Some of the photos were clearly too old to have been clicked by Zane himself. Unfortunately, unlike Kevin Aucoin who made diverse people look beautiful, this collection shows diverse people, many of whom look nasty. I didn't really need to see women in the nude missing THAT part. This book proves that Zane was a creator who will truly be missed. But I love so many more homoerotic and conceptual collections better than this one."
3,Enjoyable tale that leaves you waiting impatiently for more,This was a great first novel. Groell has an amazingly rich storyline and her dertailed descriptions of Ashkharon just paint a vivid picture. The only real weaknesses in this book were the characters. Thibault seemed a little to worshipfull of Jenifleur. While The Hound and The Falcon seemed at times like a bunch of bumbling idiots instead of the highly trained and experienced assassins they were supposed to be. Other than that this book was neato. Hopefully those characterization flaws will be cleaned up in the next book. I know I'm looking forward to it.
4,WOW - Riveting Read,I love this book! It's so good I planned to read the next one. I'll be searching for it. Jen and Thib are great characters and the story line twists and turns with the best.
2,"Very disappointing, buy it used if at all","I would give this book a pass had I to do it over again. The characters are more annoying than anything and so inconsistent its pathetic. Come on, the GREATEST assassin in the world (we are told over and over) is trapped that easily? Give me a break!! Also, the 20th century technology imported into the setting via ""the mages"": electricity, alarm systems, etc. as well as oil discovered in the desert is a very lame plot device and rather unoriginal if you ask me. All in all I was very disappointed."
5,Wow,"I thought this audio was excellent (BUT: it will only play on my computer, I tried every cd player in my house).Also, there is no chapter 5. So, I don't know if it was a verbal/written mistake, or if there is an actual chapter missing. But the info is great, it takes visualization to a whole new level. I recommend it for everyone- especially young people, so they understand early on- that you think about, manifests!"
3,Really small,"These are pretty and as shown, but really tiny hoops, got them for myself but had to gift them to my 5-year-old niece, dont think you can wear them as traditional earings."
4,my opinion,I'm a Congolese Christian musician and here in my contry people thing that I sing like Lokua Kanza but I have never discouvered his album till when one of my friends brought me his album titled Wapi yo . After listening this album I concluded that Lokua Kanza is one of the best african musician . Because his music style is a kind of a traditional music that takes care of how the world is changing .I want to say that I am very proud of him .(...) God bless Africa .
4,Love Capt Jack!,"I am not a big gamer, but love the POTC movies and so had to get this game. It is a ton of fun to play especially with a friend. You both get to play side by side on the same ""team"" . The biggest problems with the game are the poorly written directions..very hard to figure out how to use the game..what controls do what. Saving the game and starting where you left off, there must be a way to start where you left rather than havng to start over, but I have yet to figure that one out.The game play itself (once you figure controls out) is quite fun and to be able to listen to Capt Jack's(real) voice talk is truly amazing. I love being able to be capt jack and have a friend be will turner and both playing together towards the same goal and being able to help each other. This is more an arcade style game which I enjoy. I don't have to think to hard and I can easily figure out how to solve the problems and do lots of fighting."
4,This game cost me $50!,"My son loves this game and it is all he can talk about. However, the version I was shipped (twice) was not CD-ROM but DVD-ROM. Nowhere in the description does it mention that it is a DVD-ROM version and the picture even shows a CD-ROM version.We ended up having to purchase a DVD-ROM drive for our computer which costs around $50. As I said, my son loves the game and plays it everyday but I think the description should be updated."
5,tha game ..ffff its great but you will not be aple to walk free from missions,iv heard that the game is play in ship in you coomand a crew and you play capt jack what ever play the game its a littil fun
4,"Can't be ""beat!"" (aw that was a terrible pun)","The only thing not ""worth it"" on this CD is the price. Thirty-something bucks is a bit steep. (I got it at a Virgin Megastore for &10!) Otherwise, a great CD with Kerouac readings interspersed with bop's greatest hits. The excerpts provide a lucid yet credible backbone (assuming you can take them seriously, not as period-piece fodder) for the body of works. The essay is also transcribed in the hefty booklet. My only complaint aside from the price is that it's an oversized box which doesn't fit into a CD rack.But why complain when you have Dizzy, Miles Davis, Hamp, and Monk at hand!? You can't!"
1,Obsolete software disguised as new,"I can't speak for the efficacy of the material because I wasn't even able to get it to function. The product description deftly avoids mentioning that the program isn't compatible with anything newer than Windows XP, though it's plainly on the cover of the product itself. Of course you won't see this until you've already paid for it.Without getting the program itself to function it's possible to watch the conversational examples. The sound quality was very poor and made it more difficult than necessary to follow along.It's very disappointing that such an expensive piece of software doesn't even function on any computer less than 5 years old."
4,CD-ROM is a must-have but flakey on Windows 98,"If you are using Japanese: The Spoken Language as a text in first-year Japanese you should buy this CD-ROM. Unfortunately it doesn't work very well on my Gateway 500Mhz Pentium III with 128Meg running Windows 98. I was able to get the chapters to run on my machine only by copying all the files onto my harddisk. It is worth owning just to have the video, which you can run with transcripts in romanji or English - definitely a great aid to memorization. The primitive interactive features where you can supposedly play the part of one of the actors hardly worked at all. This may have been a Mac application ported to Windows 3.1. You should definitely buy this CD-ROM but be forewarned that you may need to do some creative hacking to get it to run on Windows 98."
1,CD won't run in current Windows OS,"The program specifies Windows 95, and won't run on '98, ME or XP, or using the win95 mode in XP."
5,THE CHRISTMAS TREE,"I AM SO GLAD THAT I FINALLY BOUGHT A COMPUTER. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND A COPY OF THIS MOVIE FOR YEARS. IT IS A LOVELY 4 HANKIE TEARJERKER WITH A BEAUTIFUL MESSAGE (ONE THAT YOU WILL FIND OUT WHEN YOU WATCH IT).I BOUGHT MULTIPLE COPIES TO GIVE TO MY FRIENDS. ALSO RECOMMENDED IS THE MOVIE BROTHER SUN, SISTER MOON (ABOUT SAINT FRANCIS OF ASSISI, PROTECTOR OF ANIMALS)."
3,not what I expected,"I found this cookbook very difficult to use. Although the author's background is quite interesting & he certainly brings an authentic perspective to the table, so to speak, he did die before 70 and the 40-day milk fasts seem like a bit of a radical idea. I also found it difficult to apply the recipes based upon the dosha type - which is really what ayurvedic cooking is supposed to be all about. All in all, a disappointment, although the author & editors obviously spent a lot of time compiling the contents of this publication."
1,Quit working after only 4 days,"I bought these gingerbread man lights because I thought they were adorable. However, only after a few days of working the whole set of lights failed, I have no idea why. I was careful with them so no reason for such premature failure. They were cute when they worked. Not happy, would not buy again."
5,Love That Gingerbread Stuff,"I collect all kinds of gingerbread things and these lights were just what I was looking for so that I could decorate my gingerbread tree for Christmas. I do believe that you can find just about anything on Amazon.com. They are a great company to work with.Thank you,Gwendolyn Johnson"
5,gingerbread theme complete!,I ordered two strands of the Kurt Adler gingerbread boy lights from Amazon as my theme is Gingerbread this year. They will hang or stand on top of the branches making them easy to work with. They complete the whole theme and will probably order another strand; very pleased.
1,Dollar store quality,"I bought this on sale because I loved the Kurt Adler teddy bear lights I bought last year. The difference is night/day. These are so cheap looking and onlyy light up the heads. They really look like something you'd get in a bin at the dollar store. I'm so disappointed. Unfortunately, it's as much to ship the return as the amount I would get back, so I'm just out of luck. Shame on Kurt Adler."
2,not convinced,"I was a little disappointed by the set. The heads are bright, but the bodies underpowered. Not really good value for the money, especially when you consider the shipping costs."
3,"The Script is there, but I paid too much money","I paid more than what is listed here for this book locally.The script is interesting because it has a few things in it that are not in the final cut of the film, but one can find them in the novel. The four introductions are all right, but I found only two interesting: the one by the director and the one by the writer. There are eleven black and white pictures (I read somewhere else there would be many more, including many backstage; only two of the included ones are backstage). I think I could have expected some colour ones for the price.It delivers the script, but is definately not worth the money."
1,Ambitious book title unjustified,"This book is a huge disappointment. There is only one interesting story; an engaging account by a survivor of an SR-71 crash. In its totality, however, the title ""Stories, Tales, and Legends"" is unjustified. I consider this book overpriced."
1,Decoration only,"I travel about 100,000 miles annually. I use luggage straps to help keep my bags closed and to aid in identification on the baggage carousel. These Samsonite straps just don't have what it takes. The snaps are loose, and the length adjusters don't hold."
2,loose strap,I could use this strap only once; it was lost during my first flight. It should better have a lock or a hook to fasten.
5,Belongs in Every World War II Library,"If you enjoy reading about World War II, then this book belongs in your library. Through the use of many period pictures, as well as modern pictures of the battlefield today, the author takes you through the experiences of the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment from training for the D-Day invasion through its first month of combat in Normandy. Highly Recommended."
5,An absolute lifesaver!,"This is the best book I've ever purchased! It is so easy to understand the directions and I love having my meals planned all week long. I go to her website and print off a copy of the shopping list for the week I'm using, adjust it as she instructs in the book and I'm on my way. My grocery bill is down, the time I spend in the grocery store with a toddler is cut in half, and we haven't come across one bad recipe in the five weeks we've done. We omit the chili flakes because we like to keep things mild, but the spices are so wonderful we don't loose any of the flavor when we omit the heat. We have recommended this book to so many people I'm thinking about ordering a stack of them to have on hand!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I should have known better to buy any product with only 5 reviews, but I decided to buy this anyway. It sounded like a great book from the description and reviews. I was a littled concerned that I couldn't preview the book at all but I figured it was because it was a cookbook. This book was awful! Be prepared to eat white rice 1-2 times a week! I have already returned the book but if i remember correctly, one of the recipes was chicken baked with Catalina dressing on it. I was seriously dissapointed. Every week you ate white rice and some kind of chicken ""burger"". The book talks to like you have no intelligence at all and like you have never made a grocery list in your life. This book is a waste of money and if I could give it 0 stars, I would. This is a book for somebody who has never cooked a day in their life. Don't buy!"
5,Tango Classic,"After receiving the CD and listening to it, I realized how many timesI have danced to and been inspired by many of the songs on this CD.This is a must have CD if you DJ at milongas, want to practice your dancing,and/or want to hear a great orquesta tipica with a great singer, all at the peakof their careers."
4,Penis Flytrap - Good clean fun!!!,"Being a huge fan of 45 Grave, I just had to get this! (because of Dinah Cancer)I was not disappointed at all. The only thing though is I wish this disk had more songs/time. Hope to see these fine folks come to my town to play. You can tell these kids grew up watching cheesy horror movies, as did I so I can relate and appreciate the tongue in cheek nature of this kind of music."
1,ugh...,"all I can say is : RETIRE.Although it fares well in the beginning, it then becomes very old. I give them 1 star for effort."
4,Great for historical research,"Great historical research on the ways of thinking of a culture's magical beliefs. Pyschological methods may be a bit antiquated, but the study was done from the turn of the century to 1950. Not for everyone, I needed it to study the history of the local Indian's beliefs for a book."
4,master of mystery keeps the hits coming again and again,"I have read many of Dean Koontz's books, my favorites being ""Fear Nothing,"" ""Sole Survivor,"" and ""Strangers"".I really enjoy how his hits are being published in sets of three now, and I recomend that more readers will start exploring these new sets.(except for those people who start reading and can't finish till its done, because they wouldn't be able to sleep for a while reading all three stories in a row) My favorite story out of this set would have to be ""HideAway,"" for I, like many people, have a interest in death and the power of love. The other titles, ""Cold Fire"" and ""Key to Midnight"", are intense and extremely ""well discriptive"", as are all of his books. I would recomend this ""set"" to any reader who has read at least a book or two by Koontz, for the newly-reads will need to have some experiance in intense/mystery. Well, i hope that this advice served you all well, and i wish the best for all of you Koontz readers, new and experianced!"
3,Mediocre At Best,"The original Disclaimer had roughly four good songs on the album. The alleged ""Remedy"" hit which I have never heard of until now is whiny at best. The album lacks a heart and soul, and the lyrics sound like something from the George Lucas love story vault. If you're a fan you'll learn to accept your fate that you've wasted $14.00."
3,No Disclaimer,"Album is good, but definetely tails off after the first 3 songs. Liked Disclaimer much better than this album."
4,"Pretty Good, They Didn't Change Too Much From Last Album","Good Cd. I'm Glad To See That These Guys Didn't Experiment With New Things On This Album Cause That's Usually Where Bands And Other Artists Screw Up And Make Weak Albums (Limp Bizkit - The Unquestionable Truth.) Some Songs That Stood Out To Me Were (Plastic Man, Gift, Remedy, Diseased, Because Of Me, Given, World Falls Away.)"
5,Awesome CD!,"After listening to Disclaimer II to the point that I've worn it out; I thought for sure that Seether couldn't repeat. Not only is this CD as good as Disclaimer II, it brings their music to a whole new level! This CD is already one of my all-time favorites!"
4,Better than disclaimer and worth the money!,"If you liked Disclaimer than I highly recommend buying this new release from Seether. I was a little iffy because I felt iffy about Seether's Disclaimer release. Some good songs and some I could do without. This one just smacks the other right out of the stereo. It is just so much better and pretty much sets Seether as one of the best new rock bands in recent memory (the only other bands I can even think of mentioning are Otep(so-so), Killswitch Engage, Bloodsimple(thumbs up), Flaw, a perfect circle(thumbs way up as hard as I can), and Atreyu). I'm not sure how many rock bands started out in the past 5 years (probably some myriad that I won't bother with) but one's NOT mentioned shadow in the path of Seether's Karma and Effect. 4 stars!!"
1,makes you accidentally think Creed was original...,"Seether deserves no attention, they're another grunge rip off band, totally boring crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Pretty good,"Karma and Effect was great, but not nearly as good as Disclaimer II, I love Remedy, I don't really remember any of the other songs that well though, I only bought it yesterday. The video for remedy is crazy."
1,This band will have you seething.......................MAD. FORGOT ONE THING.,"I know it's been said a couple of times but they sound like all of the bad aspects of the whole grunge period. Don't get me wrong I love AIC, the first Nirvana album, some of Soundgarden, and other Seattle bands like the Melvins and Gruntruck. But these guys are trully horrible. They make Creed sound like good musicians. Just kidding nothing could make Creed sound good. To quote my local corporate rock station."" the new rock alternative"" Wow I actually got through that without falling out of my chair. Prepackeged record company puke!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE LEAD SINGER SOUNDS JUST LIKE KURT COBAIN! YOU LOSER.................. AND TO BRYCE, NO EVERYTHING HASN'T BEEN DONE. IF IT HAD GREAT BANDS WOULD JUST GIVE UP. WHILE BANDS LIKE THESE IDIOTS WOULD CONTINUE TO MAKE MUSIC FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,improvements improvements,"seether have definately moved forward with this album. they are no longer the whiney grungey band we knew from disclaimer. disclaimer 2 was better because they remixed it to sound a little more hard rockish and that helped them. with this album they havent faltered at all. gone are the crappy 4 chord riffs that so many bands have nicked from nirvana (who are crap anyway). seethers guitarists really do pump up the power and add a superb backdrop for shaun to really push himself vocally. instead of whining which he did too much on teh last album, he starts to growl and his earthy vocals add to the mix. if you are interested in nickelback's more recent stuff (the long road mostly), some of stainds work also. but the band that these sound most a-kin to is soil. you can really hear how soil have influenced their sound. go out and buy now! now! now!Best Songs:Because Of Me: 10/10Remedy: 10/10The Gift 9/10"
5,Good Follow Up,Pretty Decent follow up! Good hard rocking CD! I think itll be the feel good cd of the summer
4,Quite a good album,"This sophmore album is pretty good.Many of the songs have catchy lyrics.The lyrical content is quite angrily sung by Shuan but not as angry as he was in Disclaimer.Some of the songs are soft.Many of the songs are good.In my opinion TRUTH is the best song these guys ever made.The chorus is superb.In the end this is a must buy considering some good tracks like 1,2,3,4 & 8.Rest are not that good but mainly act as fillers."
3,What Happened?,"I felt like the first one was theirbest album.This one has too many slowsong's.Not that slow is bad but whathappened to the hard rockin'Seether?Remedy is a hard rockin' song,I like thatsong.There are only a few other rockin'tune's on here,the rest is too slow for me.I do like Seether but the old Seether."
3,Pulled a Staind,Very dissappointing in light of Disclaimer. Only a couple of good tracks on the whole album.
3,Worth Listening To,"Though not as good as the first Seether album ""Disclaimer"". Karma And Effect is a tolerable album. All songs on the album with the exception of ""remedy"" make great background/work music."
4,Great blackberry flavor.,"This fruit leather was purchased by us sight-unseen, since there were no photos. It did not disapoint. They arrive in a box about the width of 5-6 CD cases, and about the height of 2 CD cases. The fruit leather is super-thin and VERY, VERY sticky. In fact, that's really the only negative thing I can think of. The minute you get some on your fingers, it's time to wash your hands.I think that the pack of 30 might be a LITTLE too much of just one flavor...I would like to try some other flavors!"
5,Great to read with a partner!,My boyfiend is not sure about all this hippy stuff I am learning! The good old Montana Man loved this book and his brother wants to borrow it when he is done! Great for all levels! Our friendship continues to blossom!
3,Okay,printing to slow and makes alot of noise. I will not order a cheaper calculator again. Our other Canon calculators are much better.
2,blues guitar,not much here only a half hour. no tab. small sections from other videos.the full length videos are recomended
3,Shipping and packaging problem,The cookies came crumbled into many pieces in 3 of the boxes I opened. Also the chocolate chips had melted onto the cellophane.
2,dark choc.-choc. chip cookies,liked the individual wrapping...the taste too much preservative or chemical taste. will not repurchase. you will have to try for yourself to see if you don't mind the extra taste.
5,The best cookie for dark chocolate lovers,"These are simply the best dark chocolate cookies I've ever tasted. This is one product where the hype equals the reality. Extremely intense dark chocolate flavor with high quality dark chocolate chunks. Every month I buy Ghirardelli double chocolate cocoa and these cookies to satisfy my chocolate craving and both are so much better than the waxy, overly sweet, bland chocolate you find at a grocery store. I discovered these when buying Christmas gifts for my mom who switched to gluten free, and I've been hooked ever since. If you love intense dark chocolate, these are your cookies. Keep them in the fridge in the summer since they are so packed with chocolate that they'll melt otherwise."
3,They melt in the heat!,"I really like these cookies. They are a chocoholic's dream. Just be aware if you order them when it's hot, get the fastest shipping you can or they melt inside their packages and make a tasty mess."
3,Fair,"These cookies would be better if the base dough recipe was the same as the Extreme Chocolate Mini Cookies with the addition of dark chocolate chunks. As they are, they are more sweet than chocolate, and shouldn't in any way be considered a ""dark"" chocolate. They aren't bad, they just aren't what is expected by the product description. They also arrived more crumbled than intact, a problem classic in gluten-free baked goods that can be easily corrected by tweaking the recipe. This is not one of this line's best offerings."
4,Insanely Good !,Like others have said - these are really decadent and GOOD. They are very small and most of mine were crumbled up in the package - but if you can overlook that part you won't believe what a decadent delicious chocolate morsel these are! I don't know how they do it but these are actually better than any chocolate cookie I've ever had and you would NEVER know these are gluten and everything else free!
2,How can dark chocolate disappoint?,"I was really disappointed with these cookies. I love anything dark chocolate, and the fact that they're organic was a big plus when I was contemplating the purchase. However, some of the previous reviewers were right - they are over the top sweet (and I've never felt this way about any other cookies, especially dark chocolate ones). I've never tried gluten free cookies before, so maybe that's why they don't taste as good as I expected. Usually chocolate cookies go very fast at our house, but I still have most of the box sitting around."
3,A Dentist's Dream,"I have a sweet tooth or two and love chocolate....but despite that I found these cookies to be over-the-top sweet. (Sugar is the first ingredient on the package.) I will stick to a chocolate bar to satisfy my gluten-free chocolate cravings after these are gone.If you plan to buy these, you may want to know that there are 9 cookies in each box. All of mine arrived broken and crumbled (not sure why since no previous problems with having food shipped to me by Amazon) but still taste good."
3,Good choco flavor; otherwise lacking,"As a gluten-free chocoholic, I will say that these are the best mass-produced, gluten-free chocolate chocolate chip cookies I have found. The quality of the chocolate is very good -- a nice, rich, bittersweet flavor. The rest of the cookie, however, is disappointing. The cookies are very thick (more than 1/4""), dry, and brittle. That's rather surprising given their fat content: a whopping 9g per serving.If you're a baker, you're better off making your own. But if you're not a baker and you love dark chocolate, these might be right up your alley."
2,"Taste Great, Sugar Content TOO HIGH, First ingredient","Sugar is the FIRST ingredient on the package (Organic Natural Evaporated Cane Sugar), however, when Amazon lists the ingredients they do not list them in the order on the package. Shame on Amazon. I love Amazon and order from them frequently every month and love their service. But regarding this issue I think THEY ARE WRONG not to voluntarily do the same thing. The government requires manufacturers to list ingredients in the order of largest content first. I had ordered this as part of Amazon's Subscribe and Save program because it sounded like a great product after reading the ingredient list on the site. Wrong. I had to relunctantly cancel it.They taste great. No wonder with sugar as the largest ingredient."
4,"Pamela""s Dark Chocolate Chunk Cookies","These cookies are fantastic! They are very rich and tasty. Each cookie contains rather large chocolate chunks. As Tony the Tiger would say, ""GREAT""!!!"
5,YUM!,"These are the best chocolate cookies, bar none! Even though they're Gluten-Free, they are SO tasty! VERY chocolate-y. A little crumbly, so you have to catch the crumbs, but SO well worth it. And nice to know ""Gluten-Free"" doesn't have to mean ""taste-free."""
2,tasty crumbs,"I bought these cookies as a dairy free treat. The flavor is good, but almost every cookie is in pieces with some reduced to crumbs. They came in a sturdy box, but they were destroyed somewhere in the process. I'm still eating them, I'm not crazy, they taste great, but I probably wouldn't buy them again.I found Divvie's cookies at a local store. They were super-good and not crushed. They are dairy, egg and nut free. I would probably try ordering from Divvie's to see how their cookies hold up during shipping."
2,would not buy again,Crumbly texture and they taste like they've been sweetened with stevia or some other artificial sweetener. I would definitely not buy these again.
2,"Dry, Hard, Bad","Very disappointed in these cookies - I was hoping for a something great and ended up with extremely dry cookies, some were already broke on arrival and others broke by just opening the individual bags. The cookies are small - the image here makes them look a decent/normal size but they really are a bit smaller. Case they are shipped in is great for storage, in fact that was probably the best thing about the purchase. Look elsewhere for Dark Chocolate chunk cookies though...unless you like dark, crumby hard ones."
1,Not That Good,Not very good at any price. You can find better cookies baked by your local grocery store in their clear plastic container.
1,Melted chips!,Cookies arrived with all the chips melted out of the cookies. The only way we could eat them was to crush them into crumbs and sprinkle on ice cream or pudding and even then they were very hard and not tasty.
3,Interesting and well written,Interesting stuff. The book is more of an overview of the methods that different cultures and sects have used to contact the dead rather than a book of technique. It's very readable and the text is clear and well written. There are interviews with practitioners of many methods and the overall effect is objective and well rounded.An excellent introduction into the methods of contacting spirits.
3,Pretty good.,"I purchased this DVD for my 18 month old daughter. She likes it and has learned several of the signs. What I don't like about the video is the woman in it is bland and robotic. My daughter enjoys it, but not as good as others I've bought."
2,A lot better available...,"My two y.o. had no patience for the slooooow nature of this DVD. She has Baby Babble DVDs, and all the Baby Signing Time set. Both of these products are much better than this.The person performing the signing in this DVD seems to be in super slow motion, with no enthusiasm. My little one lost interest immediately."
5,Great for my Autistic son!,"My son is Autistic and is going to speech therapy twice a week, these videos have helped him grasp his language exponentially!!"
5,Great video,"My 18 months old son loves this video, he learned to say some new words by just watching the video."
4,Signing for babies,"A good group of words of interest to an older baby. Even a few I didn't know, plus variations of some I knew. My babe liked it and she signs the words back."
5,Greatest dvd for babies,"I got the first two My Baby Can Talk when my grandson was about 6 months old. He loved them. He would sit in his highchair and watch them over and over. He is now 22 months old with a 6 month old sister. I got the third dvd for him and he loves it as well. He can sign over 100 words, and although he does not talk very good right now, he signs and says the word at the same time. His sister is very much interested in them as well. She sits and watches and studies them just like he did. Would not take anything for them. They have really helped him and his parents and me with understanding what he has to say."
2,Very disappointed,I read all the reviews before buying and couldn't tell if we would like it. What I was really disappointed about is that the person doing the signs is not saying the words. We have another sign video (Talking Hands) that the person signing is the one speaking the words so my toddler can see also how to say the words. We started watching this video when he was 1 year old and I noticed immediate progress with his signing AND talking and I attribute it to him being able to see them say the words too.To me this video is more like a baby einstein video where it just runs through lots of pictures and sounds but I don't see that this is a valuable signing video. I would probably not reccomend this.
2,Loved the first two DVDs...,These signs aren't as applicable as the first two. Still the same style of presentation but just not the same usefulness.
1,Sheds terribly,Very stiff & constantly sheds. Little stiff bristles track everywhere. Can't use it as a doormat since it creates more problems that it solves. Bought it for the boat but it sits on the dock for the birds & seals to use...
1,A few gems surrounded by Duh!,"I was given this calendar for Christmas last year and it seemed very promising - it's exactly the sort of thing I go for. There are some entertaining entries, but I think the author ran out of good material.The entries consist of stupid things people have done or said, as well as famous quotes about human stupidity, and the author's own thoughts on human stupidity. Most of the first three are ok, producing some real gems occasionally, but the author's own thoughts on stupidity are simply awful - they lack cleverness, insight, and sometimes even sense.The calendar is a great concept, but I can't recommend it. The really entertaining bits are balanced by the painful bits, and the rest is just filler."
1,Never received product,"I Purchased a book for my 4 year son. He was so excited that we found the book we had been looking for. But we waited and waited, but it never came. We e-mailed the seller twice to asked what happened, but they never responded."
4,Listen While I Tell You a Story!,"As background music while I tell the story of the hidden symbols and meanings in my Underground Railroad Quilt, this is the best collection I have found. I was pleased with the sound quality and clarity of the words. My only complaint was the unevenness of the volume. Perhaps I can adjust the timing of my story so the lower volume sections of the music correspond with the more somber parts of the talk!"
5,Great Movie--why not on DVD?,"I just bought this movie on VHS recently. This a great movie, has a lot of great actors--Sam Elloitt and Farah Facett and Katherine Ross. Although it is from the seventies it still holds up and I question why it is not available on DVD. It should be. It is a TV movie but it is really a great one. I know it would sell on DVD --needs exposure. While you can, purchase it on VHS---well worth it."
5,Remote Keyless Entry - Excellent Service,The keyless remote was received a few days after placing the order. The remote was programmed at the GM delaership and works as intended.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CHARGER,This charger does not charge! I have left mine charging over night twice and the battery symbol was still not even halfway full both times. That is like 8 hours charge time!might as well just charge it through your computer and forget about the A/C adapter.
1,ADG SPORTS SILVERSIDE TAKEDOWN GUN CASE,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.BUY A DIFFERENT BRAND! When I recieved this gun case in the mail I took it out of the box and opened the case and as soon as I did the two side straps that keep the top from floping open pulled right out.The only thing keeping them attached to the case was a little hot glue.I would have returned the case then but I figured a little hot glue and all would be OK.So then I custom cut the foam in the shape of my gun so it would hold the gun firm with no sliding. When I was done and tried to close the case I realized the latches do not really line up and you have to play with the lid to line it up to get the case to close. With the foam cut there was no return of the case possible.I emailed ADG sports with no responce.This review is only to let others looking for a good case to consider another brand. NEAL
1,Not helpful in the Least,"Too amorphous and self-referential to be helpful. The author emphasizes extreme subjectivity instead of a more useful, systematic framework for reading photographic text.There's no room for aesthetics here. Finn implies that the act of looking is so highly personal as to preclude the use of any criteria in evaluating art. Not only an intellectual dead-end, but also a justification for mediocrity. And, no offense to Mr. Finn, but his own work appears just that: amateurish compared to the included ""masters.""Skip this one and check out ""Criticizing Photographs: An Introduction to Understanding Images"" by Terry Barrett."
1,Worst Photography Book Ever,Finn has nothing to say. This is a terrible book. In no way does the author provide any insight to analyzing the content of a photograph aiding the viewer to appreciate and understand the artist's work. I cannot believe the publisher allowed this material to be published.
1,How to Look at Photographs,"I found the book nothing more than a forum for a mediocre photographer to convince an unsuspecting reader that his less than acceptable photography be considered alongside the work of great photographers like Siskind, etc. What a rambling. I forced myself to read the entire book expecting to eventually stumble on something of value. Wow...What a waste of time. I found the inane use of poetry offensive. I think an appropriate title for the book would be, ""How to Get People to Look at My Photographs."" What a dirty trick."
1,I had to put it down,"This book so thoroughly misses the mark that it's laughable. After a while, I gave up reading the author's inane babble and thumbed through the pages in search of an image that actually had text referring to it with a critical eye. Alas, it was not to be found.Once I'd seen what other titles this author had produced, the penny dropped. Finn is taking his zest for the beautiful things in life and trying to give it different titles, all the while failing to actually address the topic in an even remotely considered or generally plausible manner."
3,"Por vos, yo me rompo todo","For fans of Canaro, and /or those interested in the evolution and variety of the ""típica"" orchestra - in which Canaro tried to introduce the cornet during the 40's (listen to ""Por vos, yo me rompo todo""). It is a pity that the words sung here by Famá in ""Por vos"" are a slightly watered down version of those he sung in those times (""... Por vos, yo seré ladrón / guapo y compadrón / malo y atrevido..."")."
4,Early Canaro,"This tango great CD is from the early years of his long years of great music, I find this some what softer than some of the later work but pure early Canaro. Good for those of us who dance the tango in its older rhythm styles."
4,Movie too short,"At two hours in length, this beautifully photographed biographical film is still not long enough to flesh out the underlying story we are encouraged to imagine. The movie makes a good companion piece to The Last Emperor, as a record of pre-WWII China. But I do not know of a movie that fills in the psychology of the starving boys orphaned and raised wild by older boys -- their dreams, their fears, their codes of honor. The civilizing work of George Hogg and his allies, and its unexpected consequences, amount to another movie within a movie. And then there is the arduous long trek through mountains and out into the high Gobi desert, which tells yet another story of courage and perseverance that could have been expanded to satisfy my curiosity about the journey. How many animals did they lose along the way? Did their provisions last? Did the vegetable seeds and rice and grain they took with them do as well in sand as in the lowland mud?"
5,Children of Huang Shi,The DVD that I ordered was on time as promised. The DVD was in good condition and we enjoyed the film. The film illustrates interaction between Chinese boys and a westerner who with time and patience won the kids over to his side. Thus the long and dangerous journey began.See it! You will like it!
3,"Ok, Not A Great Movie",This had potential to be a very good movie. The material was interesting. It just fell short of my expectations. It was downright boring at times. Felt more like a made for TV movie.Rent it don't buy it.
5,Wonderful story of love and sacrafice.,"The dedication of principles who took responsibility of orphans and sacraficed themselves for their safety is a great 'good guy"" story."
3,"A smaller variation of ""Schindler's List""","""The Children of Huang Shi"" is a smaller variation of ""Schindler's List"". Based on a true story, a young British man travels to Japanese occupied China in the 1930's and goes to great lengths to protect a large group of Chinese orphans, just as Schindler fought to protect a group of Jews in Germany. This is not a sweeping big budget war movie, but rather a smaller drama about the young British man and the Chinese orphans he saves. As such, it's fairly well made, but rather cliched. Leading man Meyers is okay, but leading woman Radha Mitchell does a bad job of acting, looking stiff. Maybe with good supporting actors Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeoh, there was no money in the budget for a better female lead. If you're looking for an epic war movie, this is not it, but it is an okay drama set during a war. Reviewed 4/29/2009 after watching on DVD."
5,The Children of Huang Shi,This movie is a must see for the educated person. The reality of the story and the wonderful scenery makes the movie enthralling. It is a true story .Thanks Amazon for having it in stock.
5,Children of Huang Shi,"My DVD arrived in perfect condition and was well packed. It is a sad but very good movie, regards Carmel"
5,Great read,Captivating and insightful study on an Aymara community. Very relevant to those interested in the modern situation of individuals and communities in the altiplano of Bolivia.
1,"The ""new Breed"" of Missionary","All I can say about these Catholic priests is TOO LITTLE,TOO LATE. Here is a parable about this situation. Suppose you had a Labrador retriever that you owned for many years and really loved. Now suppose some stranger came along and before your eyes beats your dog to death, ""for your own good"". Now 5 years the same person comes along and says ""Hey, I should not have done that. Here take this Jack Russel Terrier."" Would that make the stranger a good person? Would that make up for what he did to your dog.Can a new dog of different breed make up for the brutal destruction of the one you had and loved for so many years?"
4,"Complex, diverse and often compelling........","Wendy Bucklew is one of those rare female artists who can mix emotional subtlety with straightforward honesty and create a listening experience that is both comforting and bracing in turns...Wendy's songs are complex, diverse and often compelling.... describing a compassionate but uncompromising engagement with life's relational vignettes and sagas.....she also displays her acoustic guitar chops on several songs, most notably on the final cut, the instumental ""Different Everytime,"" which is turning out to be one of my favorite songs on this album--puts me in the mind of Dick Rossmini, a 12-string acoustic virtuoso of yore.....if people are still selling this disc for around a buck (or less), it not only is a shame, it's an absolute steal, and no way you should pass it up....I'm sure that you will find that one--or several--of the songs on this disc will turn out to be worth that much (and more!) to you.....stone guarantee!trust me on this one........"
3,bandsaw book,"This is an OK book. Basic info, but dated. If I remember correctly, all pics were black and white. Guess you get what you pay for."
5,"Thorough, exhaustive, fascinating!","Superb book on the machine. Full of ideas, tuning, adjustment, basic and exotic types, etc, etc. I read it cover to cover (and it's a thick volume). Really excellent!"
5,"Worth having for ""tune-up"" instructions alone","If you have a new bandsaw (or you have an old on that's not running perfectly), this book will tell you how to set up and tune the saw. The writing is very clear, the steps are logical and the illustrations are useful (even though they're not in color). You can find bandsaw tune-up instructions on the Web -- for example at Woodcraft's site -- but nothing is as complete as this book.Beyond the tune-up/set-up guidance, you get excellent advice on blade selection and some useful ideas on how to take advantage of the bandsaw's versatility. You may want to skip the first part of the book, which describes the history of bandsaws and the types of saws available. That section is interesting but not particularly compelling.One thing I like is that the author doesn't bash Asian imports (Jet, Ridgid, Grizzy etc.). And the tune up guidance helped me get the saw I bought from Home Depot running smoothly."
2,I guess its ok if you don't know much about bandsaws,"I bought this book because I wanted to learn something new about bandsaws. Mind you, I have been using bandsaws for years, but this book told me absolutely NOTHING new. A good book on bandsaws would include other uses for the saws than just cutting wood and such. For instance, in my years of using bandsaws I have found that bandsaws are good for cutting large pieces of meat, even frozen (except sometimes it breaks the bandsaw and once I hurt myself quite badly). No mention of that in the book! Bandsaw blades make excellent plates at ""MANLY"" dinner parties (again, one injury once) but NO mention of the book. Plus the book fails to mention any novel bandsaw techniques, even for wood. No mention of the ""zen fruit"" technique a lot of builders are using now, and scarcely a nod to the ""all thumbs"" method pioneered by sweedish bandsaw enthusiasts."
5,Recommended for Native American dance costumes,"Bought it as a Christmas Gift for son that's in Order of the Arrow/Boy Scouts. This is going to help decide on his regalia and help me to get it put together. The color photos (no all photos are in color) are vibrant and the text interesting to read.This book, along with The Modern Fancy Dancer (Native American Dance Series), are ""better together""."
4,Alternative housing ideas,"I have been casting about for alternative housing ideas for a few years now and have read several books concerning building your own. This book covers, not in great depth, several related building techniques that are valuable for those of us interested in other than stick (wood) construction. I highly recommend this book as a good starting point to those who prefer NOT to pound nails in wood!"
3,Preview!!!!!,"I dislike the format and the information presented is WAY too much for my child, at least at the recomended ages. It would be a good refrence for parents to prepare for answering some of the questions themselves however."
5,we recommend it,we have appreciated the insights and approaches this book (and the others in this series) have given us as we teach our children and the youth and families we work with.
4,Give a gift that matters,"I bought this book as a gift for my 9 year old grandson. His mom recommended it to me, and I bought it. I only glanced through it before mailing it to him in England. I cannot comment further on the editorial content. The outside appearance of the book was pleasing. The small size will make it easy to hold in a small hand. My grandson told me just the other day that he had started reading it, and had some questions. I referred him to his parents."
3,Incorrect age ranges,"I think the information in this whole series of books is wonderful! However, I think the age ranges are a bit off. I don't think a 5-8 year old needs to know the details of sex. I just shared the 2nd book in the series with my 10 year old because she started talking about the word ""sex"", not knowing what it was. There are some topics in the 3rd book that I didn't feel she was ready for yet, so I will wait a few months. I will certainly give her all that information before she enters middle school. However, I want her to absorb the Godly intention for sex before she has to begin absorbing the ways in which the world has distorted it. That is truly my only suggestion - wait till the kids are a bit older than the book suggests."
3,Don't go just by the age range on the cover,"My husband and I read the book all the way through first, and we've decided to get the first two in the series before we share with our 8 year old. She's very intuitive, and has already been exposed to some inapproriate talk from school friends, but this book is a bit too much to start with. I did just start reading the American Girl, Care and Keeping of You, with her and she is excited about learning how her body is changing. We definitely want her to learn about sex from us, and with a God perspective, but we will definitely get the earlier books first."
2,shirts without a champion logo,i bought two of them in white one XL and one XXL because i wasn't shore about the quality which wasen't as neer as champion ones and doesnt have a logo outside and i was surprised about them one was made in Mexico and one in Honduras for me that is imitation of champion and i think i could spend 5 extra dollars and bye an original one from champion catalog
3,Disagree,I wholeheartedly disagree with the reviews I have read of this book. I felt that it was an interesting character study and almost frightening at times in the madness and passion exhibited by the main character. While the book itself was thin on plot the details of the characters are fascinating.
1,Contrived and Melodramatic.,"Coetzee is without a doubt a good writer and he has written many fine novels, unfortunatly In the Heart of the Country is not one of them. Not a author known for fast pacing who has made up for that with eloquence and interesting caracters without being boring. In this book he fails on all accounts. To enjoy this book you would have to be a absalut diehard fan Coetzee."
2,The Air compressor is lacking,"The Jump-starter works fine, but the air compressor is cheaply constructed with plastic gearing. Inflating a tire that is completely flat causes the pump to get very hot, the hot metal part melted the plastic gears in my pump. The pump will stop working when it overheats, but the damage will be done. The jump-starter and light will be the only thing that will function afterward."
1,Battery Doesn't Last,"My particular model was the Vector Veco105 but is nearly identical to this model in appearance and function except for the compressor, which it does not have. My experience has been similar to that expressed in other reviews, unfortunately. The DC charger broke after a few uses. Attempts to use other chargers have produced three green lights indicating full charge, however the charge was not maintained for long and the unit could not start my car. I have concluded that the rechargeable battery is extremely poor quality. This was discovered a little after the warranty expired however and so after one use, the unit is worthless."
3,Vector VEC012c by DeWalt Tools,"The compressor on this unit, like so many others this small, is really only made for pumping up toys or bicycle tires. So don't buy this unit for that purpose. Go to a gas station with quarters and use their air vender.If, like me, you bought a used unit, you will need to get both the manual and the charger. Do a search on servicenet dewalt to find the owners manual. The manual is a download pdf. Charger model number is 514005-42.Hope this helps. It's really a neat little device to have around. I especially like the built-in LED flashlight.You really NEED to read the manual all the way through. The special sealed type battery requires charging at least every 60 days or it WILL go bad quickly."
4,Jump start,"Excellent jump starter. Packaging for it was poor. A heavy item like this should have had styrofoam around it to protect it. Box it was in was almost open when it arrived. The dc charger was broken because the item was not properly packaged. But the dc charger is practically useless anyway. The jumper itself is a good, sturdily built item."
5,Great helper,"This portable generator does everything I need it to do. Before I got this, I lugged around a battery charger and a portable compressor, but this has saved me space and energy. It's a great product!"
2,2 and 1/2 really...,"i wouldn't pass this on. read, 'the late great planet earth' by hal lindsey instead. it's much better. this outline's weak."
2,Keeps adults out too!,"I'm not liking these. They are difficult for me to remove once they are in place. Also, since the plastic has a big gap versus being one continuous circle/oval, a good yank can take these off the door knobs. I bought some other ones from a different company that are continuous ovals and easy for me to use! I'd recommend something other than these for your own sanity. We need as much of that as we can get after a long day and just wanting to open the stinkin' door to the trash can! :-)"
2,"Terrible design change, but cooking oil helps.","I had a couple of these that I purchased about 7 years ago, and I liked them a lot, they were very effective for keeping our toddler out of cabinets, and they held up well. Unfortunately they got lost when we moved, so I was happy to see these available from Amazon. However the design on these has changed (why do they do that?), now they are much more difficult to open and close - by me! I have a welt on my hand from trying to open the darn thing...I did see a review suggesting the use of cooking oil on the little teeth, and I tried that, which helped. I have placed it on a cabinet that doesn't get opened very often, fortunately that was where I needed it, because it's still awkward and not easy to use. Boo on Kidco for wrecking what was once a good product."
2,Very tough to open,"I was surprised how tough this is to open. On my cabinet, the two connections almost touch each other, and the cabinet knobs create quite a mechanical interference so that my fingers can't reach in to the proper handle area where you need to lift and pull. Other than that, it was fairly easy for my 1 year old daughter to bend the plastic back to the point where she could rip it off of the cabinet."
2,Good if you never need to open the cabinet,Bought this cabinet lock and the Safety 1st SecureTech cabinet lock to see which one I liked better. I bought more of the Safety 1st locks and put the KidCo lock away. The KidCo lock works well but it is very awkward and uncomfortable to operate. My lock seemed to stick and I had to pull hard to get it to open. The result was much frustration and sore fingers. I would recommend this lock if you want to put it on a cabinet you rarely open.
4,biggest reach,"compared to the other lock, this one has the farthest reach between knobs.good for when there is a vertical piece between doors like the picture.a little harder to work, but you get used to it."
2,It's OK if you don't need in your cabinet often,"This definitely works at keeping the little one out of the cabinet, but for us was nearly impossible as adults to remove when we needed in! I want to keep my child out but I want to be able to get in! All in all I wouldnt' recommend to others unless you hardly ever need to get into the cabinet you are locking. I ended up usingSafety First Cabinet Flex-Lock 2-Packand I like them MUCH better."
2,useless,"i got this because my 9 month old daughter is really into opening up cabinets. well, as soon as i saw it, i knew it would be useless. the OTHER thing my daughter is really into is CHEWING (like most other babies). well, the teeth on the end of this thing are VERY sharp. my daughter might not open up the cabinets, but she would shred her gums. i'm going to try and securely put something about the end of the lock so that when (not if) she does start chewing it, she doesn't shred her gums. but other than that, this thing is useless."
4,"does its job, kind of a pain though","if you want to use this cabinet a lot, its a pain, but it does work to keep my kid out."
1,Very difficult to remove,"Unfortunately we had to return this item, as it's almost impossible to remove! The problem is that you have to squeeze both sides of the lock to release the ""tooth"" to slide it off -- but with the lock pressed up against the cabinet, it's very hard (if not impossible) to get it off. My husband came up with an alternative methods or removal by pushing down on the ""tooth"" with his thumb to get it to disengage, but I felt like I was going to rip off my thumb nail doing it and still couldn't get it to come off."
1,Worthless,"My 1 and 1/2 year old daughter easily removed this lock. It's not worth the money. I threw mine in the trash.A great alternative is the ""Safety First Slide cabinet slide lock""."
1,Crap,"Sent it back, it's flimsy, Any kid can break it off. The unhooking mechanism sucks. Pls don't buy this piece of crap"
1,Adult Proof Too,All I can say about these child locks is that they are adult proof as well. I had a difficult time simply opening them to get them onto the cabinet and once on....oh boy. Removing them to gain access was super difficult and not worth the hassel. I'm returning these and will be looking for something else.
2,Go Supra!,This model is great i colect al kinda models and dis one was a great replica of the one in da movie the only problems is dat it isnt dat detailed but its all good. this collectable is a collectable i dont thinkt it would make such a good toy but it would be a great model for ur room or watever. anioone dat likes tuner cars would like dis supra model...i think....
2,"Not bad, not good",I'm getting sick of Goosebumps! These books are mosly the same. The only thing that changes is the characters and plot.
5,A Spectacular Story!,"It was a story simular to ""Little Women"" to me I liked it because it was funny,scary and a mystery.Let's Get Invisible is a very good two thumbs up book it has suspense,comedy and horror."
5,Always a favorite,This will always be a favorite. So exciting and fun to read! I've read it at least 4 times. Incredibly imaginative story and well developed characters.A Goosebumps classic!
3,To Be...Or Not To Be...,"On the day Max turned twelve he, and his brother ""Lefty"", found a mirror in the attic. When the light on top was turned on, the person in front of the mirror turned invisible. The problem is that after a bit, a funny feeling comes over the one invisible.Max, Lefty, and some of their friends take turns playing tricks on each other. After awhile, they began to change. As if they were no longer the same person.***Starts out fun and normal, but soon shows oddness. It is not long before chills will run down your spine. No bad language, no violence, and no gore. Just fun chills. Perfect for children and teens.***"
1,Slow to turn on,This TV takes 4-8 minutes to turn on.Would you wait that long? I have to.Panasonics's service company did not fix it during the service call.The service tech said that if the LIFI bulb is replaced there will be no more factory warranty.Panasonic has yet to replace it.No returned calls. no more service appointments. No ANYTHING.I like the picture and the design otherwise.I have a MS in engineering. I'm not just being picky.Get real 6 minutes average to come on.!?!?
1,panasonic pt-56lcz70,Purchased this Tv at Best buy and after getting it home found that the remote would only work if you were directly in front of the tv and close. Spoke to Panasonic several times and they were of very little help. After dealing with them I carried it back two days before the thirty return ran out. Best buy tryed to be very helpful.They ordered me another one from another warehouse and we plugged it in and found out it was the same way. Its a big screen tv and made to be aways back. The remote would only work if you were within ten feet and directly in front. Bottom line is the tv has a good picture but is useless with the remote. I have three other Toshiba tv and never had this problem. I will be looking for another brand besides Panasonic.
1,Forever lamp my A##,Bought this from best buy and had to have the lamp changed 4 times in five years. After the last time it was under warranty from Panasonic I tried to buy a lamp myself to fix it since I am now a expert after watching a there tech guy change it 4 times. The cost is a joke you can't find one under $500 so I went out and bought a new TV for that price. P.S. These TV's claim to fame were that the lamps would last a life time NOT!!! I call that false advertising and there should have been something done about it.
1,Lamp Issues - Not Worth the Value,"I purchased this TV in December of 2007 and have since had to replace the lamp 4 times. These lamp replacements have been covered by a Panasonic warranty, but having to go through this process every year has been a tremendous pain. I saw the price point and ignored other comments, please don't do the same."
3,Bad Lamp,"Purchased our Panasonic HDTV PT56CZ70 in 2007. We love(d)the quality of the TV until we began having lamp problems. The lamp went four years later, 7 months before the extended warrenty we bought was up. That was last May 2011. The lamp just went again last week, almost exactly one year later. Supposedly the lamp is supposed to last 5 years. Panasonic is going to replace the lamp, I'm not sure if we will have to pay for labor. They offered us $350.00 to buy it back. I thought that was odd."
4,"Great Price, Great Set!","I bought this set from Sears during a day after Thanksgiving sale. My wife and i mulled over whether to get it or not to get it. We had checked out plasmas and lcd's that were starting at $1500.00 or more. After comparing its image to several of the 1200.00 to 1700.00 plasma sets that we could afford we decided on the Panasonic lifi. We found that the picture quality was as good as many entry level plasma sets for nearly half the price!!! I have owned the set for 2 years and am very satisfied with it.PROS-Great picture for the moneyEasy setupNice elegant looksThough it is a rear projection fairly thinCONS-Internal speakers not the greatest (would rec surround set)Calibration needed to pull out best pictureAgain, I am very satisfied and would point friends in the direction of this set!"
3,"Great TV, while it lasts...","I bought my Panasonic in 2008. It was a great TV, quality of picture and sounds were great. Then in 2009, the bulb died. I had the bulb replaced, then the following November, it died again. Again it was replaced and it worked fine again until about a year later. To date, i've had 4 bulbs burn out on me, this time for the last time. All in all, it's a great TV, but the bulb lasts 11-14 months and costs roughly $215 dollars to replace. At least for me, this is unacceptable considering, I do not wish to pay what equates to an annual fee of $215 dollars per year to have a TV. Yes, yes, they say the bulb lasts for 2 years, but that's BS. My TV is in free open space (nothing to prevent good air circulation) and is watched perhaps 4 hours a day...IF that. If you do a bit of research, you'll find that this is a widespread problem and panasonic has done nothing to fix the issue. I will be buying a different brand of TV next time."
5,"Clinical Microbiology Made Ridiculously Simple (MedMaster series, 2004 edition))",This is a must for any microbiology class.You wouldn't think a book giving only facts could be fun ... but this book has done it.
3,depends on preference,"First of all it depends aon preference to determine if this book is for you. IT contains alot of pneumonics and diagrams, which helps in remebering stuff. however it does not have immuno. IT is not detailed enough for the classroom and too detailed for the step 1.I think there are better alternatives. You can read ""review medical micro and immuno"" for the classroom and use first aid for the shelves and the step 1. I tried using the former for the step 1, but it was too much info, so i switched to first aid.i ended up makin a 229/95 on step 1."
3,Not extremely useful for clinical laboratory scientists,"I am reviewing clinical microbiology for the medical laboratory science (MLS) board exam. This book is minimally helpful for my purposes. It has very limited information about clinical identification of organisms (biochemical reactions, growth media). It has plenty of information about disease states and treatment. This may be enough for medical students, but just is not very helpful for MLS students."
5,Amazing,"This book is exactly what you expect, an intuitive approach to grasping the basics of micro. It gives the reader an excellent visualization and platform to help congeal more complicated lessons and texts together."
4,Quality Micro Review,"This is one of those review guides that's just dumb enough to be useful. Rather than give you a dry and crusty review of microbiology (which can be quite the crusty topic), this little text uses cartoons, pneumonics, and mildly off color jokes to cram facts into your head. I used it for the microbiology component of my medical school education, and then reread it with excellent results while studying for my step I examination.It's nothing too dense or difficult, and you can easily read this and retain a lot of the information in a short period of time. It's not the be all and end all for micro, but it isn't meant to be. As a quick review resource, this is absolutely priceless, especially as this is a high yield topic on both the Step I and IIck examinations."
5,Very good review of microbiology and entertaining to read.,"This is a good source to help make microbiology easier. The words are easy to understand, to the point, and clear. It is refreshing since it is not boring to read. Actually, it keeps your attention and makes studying more fun.In addition, I also used Microbiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers by Patrick Leonardi. This study guide helped prepare me for the type of questions that were asked on my microbiology exams in med school. I even used it to study for my USLME Boards. I passed the boards the first time. This says something about both these books."
3,Micro biology made simple,"Micro-Biology is not simple no matter how you cut it. Depends on the professor and if you are going into depth of Krebs Cycle, DNA RNA, Transcription, Translation. This book does not help you there but helps with general knowledge of bacteria and is easy to read and understand."
1,Talks about diseases in nurse talk,"I love this book. The pictures are great. It is really written for medical students, but I am using it to study for my RN. It uses common medical ease conversation--just like discussing a case at work. I highly recommend it for nursing students."
1,Clinical Microbiology Made Ridiculously Simple,"It is not Ridiculously simple, it is simply Ridiculous book"
5,Fantanstic for Learning Microbiology,"I found this book to be fantastic for learning microbiology. It goes over the information in a simple way, not too tehnical but not too simple. I like this funny way of studying micro.This book is excellent along with""Mircrobiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers by Patrick Leonardi. This book has tons of questions that are helpful for learning microbiology.Studying anatomy, I also recommend Netter's atlas."
4,Classic Collectable,Looks very similar to the actual Cadillac. A classic collectible for any fan of the Cadillac. It looks very nice next to the real car.
1,The Complete Oracle8 DBA Certification Training Course,The CD that comes with this book is incomplete. Plus the book is not helpful!
1,Save your money,"This is a very poor indication of Curtis's photography. The amateurish production is wrought with lame special effects that get in the way of viewing the actual works. The narration is informative at times, but redundant and often needless. I was hoping just to see his remarkable photographs with accompany score as it was originally intended. This is not the original slide show that stunned and amazed audiences in 1911. Save your money. A much better documentary on the life and monumental works of Edward Curtis is ""Coming to Light."""
1,Sorry purchase,"I bought this television a week ago and I hate it! The picture is constantly blurry, both on cable TV and DVD's. Movement blurs something awful. Images are so often out of focus that everytime I watch it for a couple of hours my eyes are blurred up from trying so hard to focus on the screen. I've tried every adjustment there is and nothing improves it. Another negative fact that you learn as you are setting it up at home is that if the light bulb it uses to project the image onto the screen burns out within a year they will replace it. If it's after a year it is your problem - cost of the new light bulb? $299.99 plus shipping Not something to look forward to. I am so sorry I ever bought this thing!"
2,I am pretty disappointed in this TV,"We purchased our Panasonic 4 months ago. Two weeks ago the Lamp went out. Luckily it is under warranty because the service call came to $529.94 ( this total included the labor and lamp)I was completely shocked. I think this TV is good if you are planning on keeping it until the warranty is up, but not long term.What happened to good quality products. My daughter has the 13 inch panasonic that was mine when I was a kid. It still works and has NEVER been worked on....Go figure!"
1,Good picture BUT...,"The TV has a great image but if you buy this TV expect to pay at least $300 for a new bulb EVERY year. There are many people with this experience. This is a Panasonic design flaw. Yes, I do have surge protection.If the bulb was $25 I would rate it higher, but as it stands I would recommend you look elsewhere for a TV."
1,Good Picture - Terrible Reliability,"BEWARE!!! This model, the PT-50LC14 and the previous model both use the same lcd lamps. They are faulty and cost $300 a piece. Do a search online for Panasonic LCD Lamps - there are literally thousands of people who have experience multiple lamp failures in the first year alone.Panasonic claims the expected lamp life on their LCD televisions is 10,000 hours. I've had my television for 3 months, so maybe 300 hours of viewing time - the lamp just BLEW. I thought I maybe I just had a bad lamp, but upon doing some research, this is a rampant problem. The first thing the Customer Service person did is have me look at the lamp, before troubleshooting anything else.I do not recommend you purchase this TV unless you can afford to buy at least one $300 lamp every year."
1,NOT THE OPERATOR. It's the equipment !!!!,"I've had my set for 3 years now and I'm replacing the 3rd lamp now. It cracks me up hearing some of these reviewers saying ""operator error"".If it was operator error the problem would be more wide spread instead of localized on one model. Plus the T.V. is set up to cool itself down. You can't turn it off and turn it right back on. It will cool off first automatically.I do love the picture ( when its running ) and it sounds great , but a $300.00 a year operating cost is ridiculous !!! I'm lucky becuase I went ahead and drop the loot for the extended warranty. But as soon as the warranty is out this suckers going in the trash..."
3,Panasonic PT-50LC14,"I have had this television for about 14 months. With the exception of fair picture quality on non-HD channels I have been very satisfied......until this week. After only about 1000 hours of use I now have to purchase a $300 bulb. I was careful about use, careful to follow instructions about allowing the bulb to cool down, did everything I was supposed to. Now after searching for a bulb I see that the problem of blown bulbs is quite common. There are even petitions that one can sign to request action from Panasonic. I have even read about a possible class action suit against Panasonic.Bottom line is that I will replace the bulb and then sell the set for the best price I can get and purchase a new set from a different manufacturer."
1,Panasonic PT 50LC14,"I purchased the Panasonic PT 50LC14 projection TV on Jan 28, 2005. Was very satisfied with the overall picture and the features built in. At 5 WEEKS old, the set went out, took 4 days for service tech to check it and found it was the lamp. The tech service was very good and informative (Sears). The lamp was ordered from the manufacturer as the tech was out of that bulb.He felt sure it was the lamp but said it could be the ballest causing it, we would have to wait and see. When it didn't arrive 3 days later as promissed I called tech support and they checked with Panasonic, they had 200 bulbs in stock and the oreder wasn't posted for 2 days and it would take 7 to 10 working days to recieve the bulb, on a TV that's 5 weeks old.(I felt next day air would have been nice). I have to say, Sears was exceptional in their service to me, I returned the set for a full refund."
1,Do Not Buy Unless You Want to Pay $1500 to Fix,"This is a HORRIBLE TV and I would never buy another Panasonic product for the remainder of my life -- nor would I ever recommend anyone else do so. If I could've rated it ZERO stars I would've... this TV is nothing but a problem -- bulb replacement, ballast problems, and so forth. And Panasonic customer support is pointless. I am awaiting the day a lawsuit is brought against this model as it was with the PT-50LC13. DO NOT BUY!"
3,"Good, non-technical history of collapse","Coleman has written a good anecdotal history of the last decades of the Soviet Union, and for those interested in the subject, but not in the technical details and statistics of the Soviet collapse, this should be an informative and enjoyable read. His years of experience in the USSR serve the reader well in understanding the fundamental shortcomings of the Soviet system, and the struggle that kept it on the world stage for so long. It must be noted that the book does not prove any theses regarding whether the West could have accelerated the collapse or not, but it does give the interested reader food for thought, especially in light of the simplistic claims by some that increased US defense spending ""won"" the Cold War."
4,Really Cool Book,"This book succinctly and accurately describes the basic clinical assessment of spinal cord and nerve root problems in 121 pages. The fundamentals of the peripheral neurologic examination havn't changed much since 1977 when this book was written; there really isn't a need for a new edition. It has served me extremely well for 22 years and I highly recommend it. What is even better, I paid $22.40 for it in 1986!Also highly recommended is Hoppenfeld's ""Surgical Exposures in Orthopaedics"" book. I am somewhat less enthusiastic about his ""Physical Examination of the Spine and Extremities"" (the ""green book"")--I prefer Bruce Reider's physical exam book."
4,INTERESTING,"I thought the book was interesting. It explained everything in detail. I was very dissapointed by the previous reviewers comments; a personal attack on Dr. Hoppenfield. I read this book because I was a patient of Dr. Hoppenfield. I must say that if it wasn't for this great Doctor and his knowledge, I would not be walking today.Dr. Hoppenfield, you gave me my life back!"
5,Talisman 7...please give us more!!!!,"The future of Talisman is potentially in the balance and this is a shame as they are trully one of if not the best melodic hard rock bands to come out of Sweden. With Jeff Scott Soto seemingly pursuing a solo career with the impending release of his solo effort ""Beautiful Mess"" due for release later this year, and Frederik Akesson now churning away melodies and crunch riffs in Opeth, Talisman may be a thing of the past. Nonetheless, we were trully blessed with this, their 7th release and it is by far their best effort. Once again it begs the question, how do these guys write songs like this? Melodic textures entwined with crunching guitar riffs and song structures to die for. Just check out the sublime ""On My Way"" or album opener ""Falling"". These guys sound so good, it's amazing that they never really made it outside of the melodic rock market and onto commercial radio and no doubt, world domination. They deserve it. Buy at all costs...Melodic Bliss."
4,Puzzle it out!!,"Most maze books are boring, black and white and either too easy or too hard. These are all in color, all are fun, all are challenging (but suitable for ages 3-13) and best of all, doing these mazes will increase your kid's logic skills, hand-eye coordination and (eek) make them smarter! Good for airplanes, sitting in airport, doctors offices, or even at church. I don't hink they're suitable for car trips unless you have a Rolls Royce because kids would get really frustrated by going out of the maze tracks with the jiggling of the car."
1,Stealing for a Living,"This is my first (and last) Naomi Rand novel. Without all of the extraneous excursions into the land of descriptive retoric this book would be a solid 25 pages long. Besides a weak plot development Ms. Rand could not resist adding descriptions of everything from a brightly decorated Christmas/Santa Clause house in a Jewish neighborhood to a freeway backup and her reliance on NPR to inform her as to how to get home.I mean, come on! Get on with the story. I decided to force myself to the end only to find a weak, off topic conclusion to an otherwise dull book. The one star rating is for the Award she got for writing, not for this book. Don't waste your time!"
5,Einstein's reflecting,"While I was working on my Master's, I had a poster of Einstein. It truly inspired me to continue my studies with my tuneup.for my intellect. I misplaced that one and found this one at Amazon, it has been framed and posted in my office."
5,Good Product!,I love the Ponds' towelette. They are big enough and takes off all my makeup. I have tried others but Ponds is the one that really works for me and leaves my skin very soft and smooth. I hope this helps.
1,May scratch the violin,When I was a kid I had a shoulder rest that looked like this one and it scratched the violin. Do not get this shoulder rest.
1,Don't Waste your Money,"This is one of the worst violin shoulder rests ever. My students who come in with this shoulder rest hate it. It always falls off the violin and we spend half the lesson picking it up off the floor. Sure it's cheap, but you will either hate your practice time and put up with it, or you will immediately purchase a more expensive and higher quality shoulder rest. Save yourself the step and buy a Kun, Wolf, or Bon Musica shoulder rest instead. It's best to try it in a store so you can see how it feels with your unique body shape and then shop around online for the best price."
3,Works OK providing...,"Used these for the past 37yrs! Never thought to buy anything different! They work OK if you position them in the correct place, bend the legs to suit you and the violin and use carefully so as to not scratch your violin with the ends. When the rubber perishes (takes MANY yrs) you can replace it cheaply with insulation or medical tape. They are inexpensive, simple, don't break, last forever, have worked fine for my students (who may not carry on with violin) and do work OK if you use them properly but maybe there are much better and dearer ones available?!!"
3,Get your needle nose pliers out,"I'm a novice violin player and I bought this rest because it was cheap. The moment I tried to put it on my 4/4 violin, it fell off. It was about 2 centimeters too wide. I took my needle nose pliers and did a little (and I mean very little) bending of the metal. Now it fits perfectly and comfortably. If I didn't have to custom bend this thing to my violin, I would have given it a higher rating."
1,Buy something better,"I agree with the other negative review. I bought this because of the low price but as it has been said you get what you pay for. The shoulder rest doesn't stay on! It also scratched up the sides of my violin where the legs hold it on. I do not recommend this one. I will be ordering a better one soon, as I only used this twice and it has been in the closet ever since!"
5,Works,"A co-worker has the Weller battery powered iron and while it works ok, it was not comfortable to use because of having to hold down the ""safety"" switch to keep heat. Having found the Hakko online, I thought I'd give it a try, and was pleased with the results. I changed out a bad switch (with 4 22 ga wires) that wasn't worth the trouble of running an extension cord for a solder station, and it soldered very well. My only complaint is the tip goes from pointy to fat a little too quick, but this is a very handy tool for small jobs."
3,"Hakko Iron, Soldering, Cordless, FX-901",The product should have been designed for cadium or MH batteries that are rechargeable. When using these batteries they produce 1.2 v per battery instead of 1.5v for the alkaline - this makes a big difference in the temperature at the soldering point.
5,Very nice!,"although I am returning the coat because I ordered a size too big, it is a very nice looking and warm coat. The faux fur is very nice and not cheap looking. I ordered it in brown. Despite my mistake, I believe it fits true to size."
1,Then or Now?,"In this book, Mark Felt denied being Deep Throat. Now he says that he was Deep Throat. So I pose the question - was he lying then or is he is lying now? Either way, we now know that he's a liar. And on his word, the media overthrew a duly elected President of the United States!"
4,"A Good Read -- No ""Ambeer"" In Your Eye Here!","As a young country boy of only twelve who grew up in a family of coon hunters from Appalachian America, I found this book in the local Bookmobile that ventured out to our elementary about once a month. I was fascinated with the visions of the Ozark Mountains that this book conjured in my mind, and I felt a kindred spirit with the main character as he spit tobacco ""ambeer"" into the eyes of youngsters who taunted him for his crude mountain ways. I recommend this book to any young boy who likes the woods or likes to hunt or likes to sleep out under the stars. I also recommend this book to any young boy who loves his dog -- especially a coon dog like the one described in the book -- a dog named ""Boy""."
1,GARBAGE!,these things are junk. weak fastening system does not allow you to fully tighten them or adjust them resulting in a constantly wobbly light. i wound up giving them to my brother who put them on his tractor. they lasted half a day before eventually falling off. do not buy these. oh yeah...the instructions were in french.. WTF>?
4,Better than expected,"I wasn't expecting much for the price. But these guys are bright and quite focused. The mounting hardware is not the best. the bolt is not held at all to the light (spins freely) so while tightening you have to hold the bolt with pliers to tighten. To give it a sealed mount I coated around the mounting hole (.310 drill) with rtv and it helped solidify the mount from wiggle or movement. I suspected the dimness complaint is from the wiring it looked to be 18-20 awg. I used 14 Awg to be safe and it is bright. So I'm pleasantly surprised with the result. Just throw away the wiring(save the switch) and be cautious not to overtighten the bolt, it is plastic after all."
2,Horrible Mount,"The Fog lights didn't seem to be to bad but it's one of the worst mounting options i've seen. Can't give it a good review because of that. Plus there isn't any directions in English, but you can figure it out."
3,Driving Lights for boat,"The case is a lightweight plastic. I think the plastic case will serve me well because they won't rust, but if I were wanting a more durable light, these would be too lightweight. I don't think they could take the day to day abuse of a truck."
4,Sweet Album,"I'd have given this album 5 stars, no problem, but there's one thing that holds me back from doing so...the mixing. The musicianship on the album is friggin tighter than yer drawers, but it seems like someone mixed the album with the low frequencies turned all the way down. There's no bottom to it, which sucks. You can feel the groove emotionally (which is definitely most important), but you can't feel it physically. Very little kick drum, and more importantly, very little Oteil. All you can hear are his high-end pops and slaps, and it just kills me. The album just delivers no shake or rumble to the speakers.As for the music, yeah it's awesome, no question. For the not-as-nitpicky-as-me, this album will blow your head off. And I mean that in a good way."
4,Well done!,"A biography filled with wonderful detail, even though centering on Linnaeus' economic program. At times the author appears to be making fun of Linnaeus' odder ideas rather than attempting serious historical analysis, but in all a good job and an interesting argument."
3,Very early De Lint intended for YA readers,"I picked this up reflexively, thinking that I had found a new De Lint. I had not realized that I had found a re-release of his second book, nor that it was intended for a YA audience.For serious De Lint fans (me!) it is interesting to see how his themes have developed over the years. This is much more representative of his later work than something like Wolf Moon. Unfortunately it is nowhere near as polished as something like Forests of the Heart or Moonlight and Vines and the age is visible from the state of the craft. The plot is overly complicated for the length of the book, and the character of Minda is a shadow of the female characters who appear in later novels.First time readers of De Lint probably want to begin elsewhere. De Lint fans should expect an enjoyable read, but one not quite up to the level that his work normally achieves."
2,I didn't make it past chapter 5,"Apparently, this is one of de Lint's earliest books and BOY does it show. I read The Dreaming Place and thought it was okay, so decided to try the other de Lint YA I had lying around. First of all, it's the same basic story as The Dreaming Place. In the back of the book de Lint admits he wrote the same story over and over again for a while. I must concur. And even though The Dreaming Place had it's bad moments, they weren't all crowded in front like in Wren.The book opens in some sort of vaguely English/European small town in the vague past. Sometime after the middle ages, perhaps. But I cannot tell. The clumsy way de Lint introduces characters and sets up the conflict aren't really indicative of his later talents. And he has issues with how to use secondary characters effectively.This is very clearly an early novel. I'm sure some kids will get some enjoyment out of it, but anyone over 16 or so should probably just move on to de Lint's later, adult novels."
4,"HAL is obnoxious, funny and very interesting.","I always enjoyed HAL's obnoxiousselfconfidence. His insistence that- No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information.That they are foolproof and incapableof error -is funny, absurd, very human, proud and down right crazy.But at the same time intriguing.The book look at the issues and technologiesthat would be critical if we were to build HAL.And the book let us in on some of HAL's secrets.In the process it just all becomes even more intriguing.An excellent book for anyoneinterested in artificial intelligence, cognitionand Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction.A must have book!-Simon"
3,not as expected,"My daughter and I have been reading this series about the Casson family and loved the quirky characters in this family. We really enjoyed reading Saffy's Angels and Indigo Starr together but Permanent Rose seems to be written for a much more mature reader. I felt that this was not an appropriate book for a younger reader and might be better for 12+. Too bad, prior to this my daughters favorite character was Rose - who she could identify with and now she has lost her interest."
4,Nearly likable Rose,"It seems that once I began this children's series, I couldn't stop. I'd be embarrassed if I didn't enjoy them so much.I enjoyed Rose in the previous books. I found her 8 year-old honesty refreshing and charming. Until I was faced with it as the focus of an entire book. Yes, I understand she's 8. Yes, I understand all that being that young encompasses. However, there were times when it was simply too much!Rose basically used blackmail to get her way, and the fact that she was a little thief was never fully explored. The ending felt very rushed, and David's inclusion (Indigo's friend, and another example of how poor Indigo can't keep friends for himself because they all feel some connection to Rose) was fine, yet seemed trite with the ending.All in all, I still enjoyed it, but would have liked more of the already established things from the previous 2 books. This one seemed to skimp on what makes the Casson's such a wonderful (if slightly odd but not quite dysfunctional) family."
5,A lush journey through aurel space that truly warms you!,"Lucias trilogy is really astounding in terms of the amazing range of sounds, textures and rythms the artist blends together. The artist takes us on a journey through spiritual space, sound is our visceral guide. This music is truly healing and sounds new with every listen. Give it a try and find yourself feeling refreshed and healed!"
4,No battery included with car,"Even though the picture shows a battery, there was no battery included with car.That's my only complaint with this product.The car works great; great control, excellent range.Very tough; I've flipped it several time learning to control it,yet the car comes through with no problems whatsoever.I'd recommend this product to anyone; just don't be fooled by the picture.It's >NOT< ""ready to run"" - you still have to buy a battery pack."
1,Old Technology!!,"The Tamiya Hornet is good for a nostalgia piece, and that's about it.This buggy is a very old design that has been re-released by Tamiya (along with the Frog, Vanessa's Luchbox, and a bunch of others). If you've been in this hobby long enough to remember the original and want to own a copy, then by all means, buy it. If you're new to this and want a durable, good handing vehicle, spend your money elsewhere.This buggy is very outdated and uses friction front shock absorbers that are basically worthless, plastic bushings in the transmission and wheels (seriously, Tamiya? WTF?) a weak hard plastic chassis, and a cheap, slow RS-540 motor. For the money, I'd recommend a modern buggy such as either the Traxxas Bandit or the Duratrax Evader BX (which is actually cheaper and much, much better). You'll have a far more capable and upgradable buggy that you can actually find parts for.Note to Tamiya -- Take a look around."
5,Turning the macho adventurer into a human being,"Cahill's wry juxtapositions, his diffident styleand his (on the whole) unjudgmental descriptions make him a pleasure to read. The fun in his books are from all human frailties, including his own. He clearly loves to learn new things and communicates that wide-eyed interest to his readers."
2,"Don't pass the butterworms, please!","I was quite disappointed with this book, after Pecked to Death by Ducks and A Jaguar is Ripping my Flesh which were truly rip-rollicking great fun."
4,Mystery and history,"Forrest combines history with suspense and comes up with an interesting and very readable instalment in the Kate Delafield Mystery series. An unpopular tenant is poisoned in a slightly seedy apartment block peopled by Hollywood employees of the forties and fifties. These eccentric and enchanting characters bring to life the era of McCarthyism and the House Un-American Committee, as well as nostalgia for the glamorous Hollywood of that time. Of course, lesbian detective fiction wouldn't be complete without romance, and Kate Delafield finds that in the Beverly Malibu. This novel has a strong story line and keeps you guessing until the last moment - I recommend it."
4,I have told people to buy the book!,"This is a good collection of stories. I liked 'Aeroplane Tonight'.... it did not agitate me like some of the others. It was clever and I had not read anything like it before. I liked ""South Side"". It just hit me right. I thought about ""Buck's Back"" days after I read it. Liked the style, but I am a wimp these days and the topic was disturbing. I would read ""Aeroplane Tonight"" again...I don't know if I would read ""Buck's Back"" again -- good but too disturbing. Some I do not even remember now and some I can recall well... I remember ""Red Mercedes"" and ""One Mississippi."""
2,Enjoyable but not enough pictures!,"The stories were great, from the red woman to the creepy slave dealer who takes d-marks for young girls. The cover photos rock, just more pics! Please!"
5,Great print.,The product arrived on time and the condition is great. The print is also great.The product arrived on time and the condition is great. The print is also great.
2,obsolete,"I've had this manual for years, and referenced it when taking the 18D preparatory course. Problem is it's obsolete. Get the Special Operations Forces Medical Handbook, 2nd edition. Available from Government Printing Office for $60. Up to date and excellent format."
4,OK book.,"I got this book in the mail yesterday. The book is full of great information that could be useful when a hospital or doctor is not around. The only this I would say is that for the person who has no medical knowledge and picks this book up, the illustrations are very primitive and there are not many of them. For something as important as locating a nerve to numb a site, there is only a small stick figure type thumb nail size drawn image. Other than that, take the time to read it, and learn a lot."
2,Not Loussier,"I appreciate Bach played by Argerich, Tureck, Manze, and even Loussier. I took a gamble with this one, but it sounds like Bach by Lawrence Welk. Not much depth."
1,Wastewater Injection,"I hoped it would provide timely information for injection wells in the fracking oil and natural gas industries. It reads more like a journal, and is unfortunately, dated."
3,ill-fated tom jones,"Alexander Serov used to play sax in a sleepy southern Russian town before he jumped on the wagon of Gorby's Perestroika and made Moscow, early 90's. Beefed with thick rhythm section and full orchestra onstage, he cut impressive figure - gold chains, black suits, stately physique et al. Serov succeded in homing in on Tom Jones' ever attractive persona. If anything, he beats the original in sheer decibels, urgency and immediacy. His English is awful but, fortunately, he knows better than meeting Jones on his native ground. He gives Jones... a twist of America. It's hip nowadays to immitate American phonetics (and everything!) in Russia, and Serov, for once, does so with great poise."
1,Save yourself some money...,Type in (or cut and paste) the ASIN number B0000CFYPA in the search field and it will take you to the EXACT same Amazon item that sells for $120 cheaper AND comes with a free adaptor!! Both items are the PSRK1 - Yamaha Karaoke 61-key keyboard. Save yourself some money AND get a free adaptor!!!!!!!! That's the only reason I gave this item a low rating - great product - buy it for less!!!
4,"Want a hilarious, off-your-rocker fantasy story? Read the following!","I LOVED this book! Most of the time, the plot is pretty random, but it still makes sense. This book is hilarious (of course, since it was written by a teenager *wink*), and some of the jokes will keep you rolling for a couple of minutes.The book starts off in the court of Lord Bugle, the guillotine-happy master of the main character, Jason. Jason is not very different from the average teenager today, except for the fact that he lives in 14th-century somewhere, goes off on a quest, and finds himself in all sorts of crazy circumstances, from a gnome companion posing as a human and memo-writing corpses, to a troll named Dr. Jorf Riceman and a mysterious letter that Jason and Chris (the troll) must carry to the next kingdom.A plot twist at the end of the book startled me, but the book seemed to end as it should.My rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars. Just one last thing: Never try to rescue a 90+ princess named Bagerta."
2,so-so,has an abrupt ending and the story never explains itself. Why does the monster exist? The story reads as if it were part of a series that perhaps I have missed. I am glad I only spent 50 cents on this book.
3,Out there,"Written in 1960's far out language, and at times Frank gets off track, but a good read written by a real Hells Angel who tells it the way he sees it. This book helped me understand why Outlaw Bikers are what they are. Freewheelin openly talks about his upbringing and relationships and its not hard to understand his outlook on life."
4,Far out,"I am about half way through the book and it has been enjoyable, but its written by a Hells Angel in 1960s jargon and its sometimes hard to piece the language together. It does nothing to soften the image of the Hells Angels, but I think that is what it was designed to do. There is no doubt that the Angels are bad dudes, we all know that now. But in the 60s, they were establishing that fact with these kind of Public Relations. I am not sure that everything is factual, but I am a Biker and love to read about the Outlaws, so I am having a good time with this book."
3,pro stroke golf,"The game is just ok! I find that if I turn the controller 90 degrees, I play better.definately not a tiger game!"
2,Catch 22?,"When the used copy of One Woman, One Vote arrived, I saw that it had been underlined and did not meet the vendor's claim of ""like new."" When I contacted the vendor they apologized and said if I did not give them a bad review, they would make good on the order and to contact Amazon. Seemed fair. However, when I applied to Amazon I was informed that refunds come only from the vendor. I won't deal with the Chips Used site again."
5,"Haunting, breathtakingly beautiful","Lucia brilliantly uses keyboards and synthesizers, with exotic percussion, bells and flutes collected from her travel in Tibet and elsewhere, and while maintaining an interesting balance between sensuousness and a kind of Goddess-like otherness, invites us to explore the hidden-most recesses of our hearts and souls. Lucia Hwong - Celestial Realms is an essential recording for anyone who treasure this kind of haunting, ethereal music. It is touching, lifting, mind-expanding music that will brighten your day and make the stars shine with greater luminosity in your night."
5,A sensual sensation that soothes the ears of the soul!,"After giving Ms. Hwong's first LP a spin, it was wonderful to find out that there was more where that came from! This second part brings you to the after hours lounge of the soul. It is deep, dark, yet so softly textured that it feels uplifting in a very dark sexy way. Worth a spin after 3AM! It works!!!"
3,"Good , not great .","Not a bad CD for background music but not much variation in the tracks , when you've heard one you've pretty much heard them all ."
5,ONE OF FOUR THEMATIC COMPILATIONS,"DANSER,UTILE,AIMER and PARTIR are four greatest hits albums covering all of JULIEN CLERC's output from 1968 to 1997.Great for fans who don't want to spend for the whole collection.DANSER like all the others has songs from all of JULIEN's lyric writers:RODA-GIL,McNEIL,PLAMONDON and also one from GAINSBOURG:the delightful MANGOS.JULIEN's most celebrated lyric writer is ETIENNE RODA-GIL who has 8 songs here including C'EST UNE ANDALOUSE and ADELITA.PLAMONDON has 4 songs including the big hit COEUR DE ROCKER.After many years of working with others ,JULIEN and ETIENNE have decided to work together again in 1992 for a complete album.Fans won't complain since they were born to work with eachother ,and they really put their respective talents in celebrating FRENCH popular music."
1,One of the most rediculous books ever written... and a total hoot!,"We rate this book 1-star for its pompous absurdity but 5 stars for unintended humor. We laughed all the way through! The author (a ""wimmin's studies"" graduate) seems determined to suck all life out of our language. If a word bears even a hint of sexual bias -- or sexual acknowledgment or some gender based source somewhere in its root system -- then it must be excised and replaced by a ""gender neutral"" term. Examples: Don't say ""hangman,"" say ""executioner."" Don't say ""mannequin,"" say ""display figurine."" ""Master bedroom"" should be ""main bedroom"". ""Patriot"" (with its PATernal connotations, which we were not previously aware of) should be ""nationalist."" However, ""vampire"" is okay, since it is gender neutral, as is ""mummy,"" as long as it is referring to the Egyptian kind. BUY THIS BOOK if you want a good laugh at the author's expense. It is better than James Finn Gardner's ""Politically Correct Bedtime Stories"" because it is REAL."
5,Better than what I thought,"I purchased a pair of these to replace the ones on my 89 Camaro. I wanted something for the looks and didn't expect much performance from that price. But these actually produce decent lighting. The only thing is that the screw on the back and it's housing is a little weak and may not hold tight after you play with it a few times. Either do it right the first time or just change the bolt in the back. These are the same found at Autozone for the same price. I am over all happy with the purchase, and specially the price."
2,not thought out very well....,"the mounting bracket on these is terrible. its a slot cut into the plastic housing with a screw comming out. the slot is way too big with no protection from water. it seems like this product would break within a week of driving in some rain. the picture of this product on amazon does NOT match the actual product. besides the huge slot for the mounting, the glass is held on by two cheap peacies of plastic that also do not seem to seal the light housing.Long story short, this product is very cheap, and does not seem like it will last. I am pretty upset about product not matching the picture. if i had seen this type of mounting style, i would not have bought this product.I recommend spending the extra couple bucks to get a product of better quality."
1,No returns,I wanted to exchange for a bigger bottle and they would not let me. Had to keep the smaller bottle for way...to much money!
5,"Great band with solid base playing, strong lead vocals","The Grapes make music fun for listening and fun for dancing. Strong songwriting, vocals, base and keyboard contribute to an enjoyable cd."
2,Anti-Catholic Propaganda,"If you are truly interested in the history of Hallowe'en, this isn't for you. It's basically a ""history"" book as written by a fundamentalist christian. Sort of a ""you'd better be good or else"" book. So it's full of anti-Celtic, Anti-Catholic jibes. It actually offended me. But everyone is entitled to their opinion, I guess. I just don't have to buy it. I sent it back."
2,Very interesting book,"Overall, this was a very musing book. I did like the the subjects mentioned, they peeked my interest. But I believe the main problem was that the subjects never made any valid arguments toward their case. This made the entire book present itself as a fallacy, which is the absolute opposite of what Mr. Uselton was trying to do. I really would have enjoyed the book a lot more if it was in much fuller detail of the history of halloween, and the motive for its concern and darknes."
3,He said/ she said seems to be the review discussion point,"If you are looking for an in-depth study of the history of Halloween, then this book is not for you. However, the author has tried to remain objective (despite his Christian background) by quoting secular books to make his points (I liked this feature of the book). I have noticed in the reviews that many self described pagans take offense at the way he presents the information, but they do not refute the information with facts, just rhetoric. Anyway, even if 1/3 of the information in this book is accurate, people who are Christian should think twice about celebrating Halloween. Maybe they should celebrate in a manner less pagan such as; celebrate the harvest time or the fall season."
2,disappointed - simple prose with difficult tabs,"My 4 year old son and 1 1/2 year old daughter are McDuff fans, but I bought this book for my daughter. While the prose is age-appropriate for her, manipulating the tabs is too difficult for her. At first, she wanted to pull on McDuff or the bunny, but when I showed her she had to pull the tab, she tried that and couldn't do it. My son has trouble with about half the tabs in the book, but the prose is far too simple for him. He knows it's a baby book.The book would have been much better with just lift-the-flaps. In that case, I could leave the book on a low shelf for my daughter to read any time, along with her other lift-the-flap books. Instead, I have to put it up high. I don't like doing that, but she will tear it in frustration if I don't.Save your money for other McDuff books. You can't go wrong with the original McDuff books, and I saw the McDuff touch-and-feel book which looked fine for babies."
5,Our Daughter's Absolute Favorite!!!,"This is our Daughter's ABSOLUTE favorite book...she wants to read it every night before bed. Perhaps she has a preference for this book because we have a westie just like McDuff, and we replace the name McDuff with our dog's name, Bailey. Regardless, she loves the flaps and ""helps"" us to pull the tabs. Given the fact that we read this so often, McDuff has only ""needed one repair"" so far, he just ""jumped off the page."" I recommend this book to everyone who can supervise the reading time until the child is old enough to respect books on their own."
2,Kinda short,The book is cute but a little on the short side. I was a tad disappointed when I got it.
4,nice stakes,got these last year and they still are being used in the garden. Best price i found on the net!
4,3 Foot Plant Stakes,Great stakes for the price...good shipping seller ..recommended.Just make sure youorder the right height
2,"I agree, not comfortable.","I ordered this set before any reviews showed up and am very dissapointment by just how stiff the sheets are. They are not soft in the slightest, it's like sleeping imbetween large sheets of paper. I wouldn't recommend them at all, and plan on returning them or religating the to the seldome used guest room. That is all they may be good for, I certainly wouldn't buy them again for personal use."
2,Shabby Color Scheme,"While quality is ok, the color scheme on this set is really ugly. The pic is much prettier than the real thing. Avoid it."
4,A good introduction to the topic,"This slim, amusingly-illustrated book introduces perspective concepts in an entirely unintimidating way. Lightweight, but still useful. Though it is printed as part of the somewhat lowbrow Walter T. Foster How-to series, the author is a true authority - he also wrote the article on perspective for the Encyclopedia Brittanica"
3,"Good design, However...","The Forces of Valor Toys (military miniatures) are very good in their level of detail. Often though, they require a fair amount of time to piece together, instructions are vague, and delicate parts are weak, eg, plastic gun barrels often are slightly bent."
1,This is the worst math textbook I've ever had.,"I took a Real Analysis class at Cal. State Univ. Long Beach a year ago. William Ziemer's son, William Ziemer, was the professor. Even that didn't help. This book is impenetrable from every angle. It's good for stopping bullets and flies across rooms rather well, but that's about it."
4,A decent collection of horror stories,"Well this book is a mixed bag. Some of the stories I really liked and were really well written, yet others I just didn't like at all. I loved the chilling story of ""Canavan's Back Yard,"" and I thought ""The Rubber Room"" was an interesting tale of a paranoid man thinking Jewish people had a conspiracy against him. Also, ""Out Of Sorts"" is a clever werewolf story. And as other have mentioned, ""Down Among The Dead Man"" is an excellent WWII vampire story (while that may sound bizarre, it is written so well you won't even notice just how odd this seems). However, like I said, I did not like some of the other stories. Like ""Death To The Easter Bunny,"" for example. I just found this story repulsive (if you've read the book, you'll know what part I'm talking about.) And ""The Crazy Chinaman"" also seemed very out of place in this book. But in this book, the good outweighs the bad. I would recommend this book to fans of horror in general or fans of any of the authors."
3,A strange collection,"This book has good stories and bad stories. No, there is no bad written story. There are some stories very difficult to believe, like ""Death to the Easter Bunny!"" By Alan Ryan. At least, I can read another Stephen King, ""Nona"". But it is not enough to get a 10. Paulo Sunao"
5,Fantastic !,"This book is great! I bought it because other data architects at a conference recommended it. I'm a data architect and after reading it, I am recommending it to others. It is very easy reading and also an excellent reference guide. By showing others chapters in the book, it has helped me explain XML and how it affects our company. I recommend it highly for all those involved in information technologies."
2,This book is not ... a lot of things,"The content of the book is very appealing, but I found many problems:- a good knowledge of XML schema is required- a good knowledge of data modeling topics is requiredIf you have the required knowledge, you will find a lot of obvious things, that you maybe already know. Some hints and methodologies are useful, but they represent only a small portion of the book.If you don't have the required knowledge, you will find difficult understanding the ""big picture"" from which the ideas in the book are derived.I don't suggest buying this book."
2,Meagre content disguised by vague writing and padding,"There isn't much real content in this book and you have to trudge through a lot of vague and cumbersome writing to get to it.Here's a representative extract:""What should be obvious to any practitionaer is that effective engineering of a schema requires expertise with metadata and related data archtitecture disciplines. Wihtout a metadata and data architecture focus, the broad proliferation of nonstandard and ad hoc XML transactions and schemas will be seen, resulting in increased data disparity, integration complexity, and a failure to reduce related technology costs."" (page 197)It also has a very poorly produced index, which makes it far less useful than it might have been as a XML schema reference book."
5,Hilarious and sweet!,"There are so many ways this and other Gaspard and Lisa books are a wonderful treat. What an original fresh way of telling a story, conveying the characters personality and sense of humor and adventure. You and your children will delight in finding the funny little details. You cannot go wrong with this or any of the other stories in this series."
4,Autozone Lights,"These are the exact same lights they sell at autozone. I really like the look of them and the case is decently sturdy. They definitely aren't as bright as more expensive lights, but I bought an HID replacement kit off ebay for 50 bucks and these things are brighter than any name brand light you could give me."
4,Good bang for your buck,"What can I say, you get pretty good stuff for 25$. Theyre no Hella 500s, but they have only 9 amps draw total, so I didnt fry Another alternator! They have about 120 degree light bands, but they focus in a beam/line down the road. Im not particularly fond of this effect, but I just angled them to the side slightly. Had them on 2 weeks so far, and no complaints. They light up pretty good alone, but my HIDs still dominate.So, I reccomend these as a great starting point for off-road mods/looks without burning a hole in your wallet. 4/5Word of caution: follow the directions, and run it straight from the battery. Dont do some fancy relay work and integrate them into an extra fuse so they shut off automatically. Believe me, you will either blow some random fuse, or roast the alternator. Did this on my toyota, and the computer is extremely touchy...... Please follow manufacturer directions!"
3,Good Product Adequate Light for Price,I installed these lights for my Polaris Ranger for overhead beams. Included were nice lens covers and the installation kit included had good instructions but cheap hardware. The light output is fair no better than the headlights on a UTV. For the price the lights are a fine addition for any price conscious buyer looking to get a type of placebo effect from a set of off road lights.
2,not so hot,"short and sweet, this item is no more powerful than stock headlights. I put them on and they put out less light than my bright headlights. Do not bother with this item unless you want to use it as an ""alley light"""
3,"Not a true ""fog"" light","These lights are marketed incorrectly. They ought to be labeled ""Driving"" lights and not ""fog"" lights. They cast a medium distance, narrow beam. A true fog casts a short-medium distance, wide beam.Further, I feel the wiring harness is not usable. I did not use included harness. I used 10 Gauge wiring with relay to prevent voltage drop at the light. They are bright when wired in this manner.So, if a medium distance, narrow beam is your goal, then this light will suffice."
1,didnt work right,i ordered these lights thinking hey these look good and are cheap and are on the top of the serach list of amazon for fog lights plus it had alot of good reviews but these did not work right for me they were very dim and when you would unplug one the other would get a little brighter but still not like a fog light should. and i had them hooked up correctly also
2,They were nice when they worked.,"I bought these not expecting a whole lot, I knew they were cheap, but I wasn't expecting one of the lamps to go out within a month of ownership with minimal use. Not to mention, they can be QUITE difficult to mount and keep in the position they were originally mounted. But, I suppose this could vary by vehicle."
3,"Not bad, but nothing special","Spent about $20 on these at a local store on sale. decided to put them on my truck for added light. they dont really give off much light at all, but for $20 im not disappointed in them. but im also not amazed by them. all in all, they will be good for small items like law tractors, and things like that. i will mount these facing rearwards for loading and unloading stuff from my truck bed. they will be great at that.also, does anyone know what the bulb type is? i am wanting to replace the bulbs in these with something brighter."
4,Ketchum doing what Ketchum does best,"While not his best book, this one certainly keeps you amped up. The premise reads a little like a LIfetime Televsion movie script...If Quentin Tarantino got his hands on it. Some guy kidnaps a woman and her husband and makes them drive him around while he goes in a killing spreee. Sounds weak? It's not. Ketchum has this amazing way of tortuing people that just makes you loathe the antagonist. By the end of this book you will be routing for revenge. And you will squirm and grit your teeth as Ketchum continually throws you off course into some new realm of mayhem. Very good stuff."
3,"Definitely not as good as ""Girl Next Door"" and ""Off Season""","After reading ""The Girl Next Door"" and ""Off Season"", I can only give this book 3 stars. It's good, but it's not his best, and it gets a little repetitious at times. After what one has to go through to find themselves copies of Jack Ketchum's books, one expects no less than the best."
2,Somewhat Disappointed.,"I assumed this DVD contained episodes from The Berenstain Bears that is currently shown on PBS. Well, it turns out it's episodes from the 80's, so the quality is fairly poor. The stories were fine, my daughter watched all the episodes, but I'm somewhat disappointed."
3,cute and my kids love it,"This video is cute and my kids love it. It seems a little outdated since it is from the 80's, but the lessons are still true today and my son has really taken an interest in hockey since watching this one! Although, Mama Bear seems to need a little more patience with her kids sometimes! Definitely from a few decades ago :)"
2,These are old-school!!!!,"The ""episodes"" on this video are not like the others we have. They have very old looking animation and the voices aren't the same as the newer ones. In my opinion, they really aren't done very well. There are some good lessons in them, as like in the other videos we have, but there are also some quite mean characters that say things I wouldn't want my children to say. I really like a lot of the other Berenstain Bear videos, and have a number of them, but this is one I wouldn't recommend. I think it's more about being rude and than about kindness and caring."
5,I love this lock / key system,This is a great childproof lock / key system. No unsightly plastic and locks visible to the naked eye. I don't ever use the holder for the key b/c it actually just attaches to our windowsill (magnetic). I love it.
1,Does not work,"This is just the key for the locks but the system does not work well. Our first attempt with swinging doors required them to be closed with enough force (but not too much) for the latch to catch. This would require way too loud bangs than what we are used to and wish. Most of the times the door would remain unlocked.We then tried using this on drawers and the same thing happened. The tolerances are too small for it to be easily installed. The latch moves on gravity and so it is to weak to catch and stay put. We abandoned this product and whilst the sticky portion is ruined, we will try to get a refund."
4,Makes your cabinets kid friendly and neat looking,These are great products to make your kitchen and bathroom cabinet kid friendly and clean looking. You will no longer have to stare at kid locks again. Heres my summary of the product+ Clean look and feel!+ No more visible kid locks+ No Drilling holes unless you want to!- Sometimes the plastic end of the magnet falls off. I have gone through three magnet now.Overall I love these and have them in all rooms of my house and I am really happy with the solution.
1,Piece of junk.,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! This product does not work and it leaves a terrible sticky mess behind. This products only works in theory but not in actual life.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Just buy the Safety 1st old fashioned ones and they come with stickies as well.
1,These didn't work for me...,"I was not a fan of these at all. First of all there is a huge chance I'm going to lose the key at some point. Also, for many of my cupboards they would not fit together properly to lock (I followed the instructions well)."
1,This item is made cheap,They do not stick long enough for any child. They do not help even if screwed into the wood. Don't purchase this item!!
3,"THIS IS A KEY ONLY, NO LOCK!!!","I purchased this item labeled ""KidCo Adhesive Mount Magnet Lock-KeySet"", reading it as Lock-Key set(Lock & Key) as listed in the title. The description also reading ""THE ONLY MAGNET LOCK that installs with out tools or drilling!"" and that it included a key and key holder. Reviews also were for the lock's effectiveness.Upon receiving it I found that it was ONLY, which was disappointing. Had I known that I would have ordered the locks as well.Review is not for product per se, but more to warn buyers so they don't misinterpret this as I did."
1,BEWARE!!!,"BEWARE...IF YOU HAVE METAL HARDWARE ON YOUR CABINETS, THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THESE LOCKS WILL NOT WORK. THE METAL HARWARE INFLUENCES/SCREWS UP THE MAGNET IN THE LOCK THAT YOU ATTACH TO THE CABINET DOOR, THUS NEVER ALLOWING IT TO GO INTO THE LOCK POSITION. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. NO WHERE WAS THIS STATED THAT THERE WAS EVEN A CHANCE OF THIS HAPPENING IN PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS ONLINE, ON THE PRODUCT PACKAGING, OR ON THE COMPANY WEBSITE. I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONSUMERS TO KNOW BEFORE BUYING THE PRODUCT!!!!"
2,not that impressive,loved the I dea of them not having to drill. My son pulled the cabinet off of one so it appears we have to drill.
4,Another great Turner work,"As usual Ms. Turner has captured the mind of the reader. For a beginning author her work is exceptional. A fast paced mystery that is hard to put down. Looking forward to more work from her.Her other work, The Desk, is in the same caliber, set in her home town of Memphis, Tenn."
2,You have to be curious about one room schools,"I bought this book for my mom who went to a one room school in rural Wisconsin in the 20s and early 30s. It took her a couple days to read (she reads a LOT!). When asked if she liked the book, her reply was ""ehh"". Translated from ""mom-speak"", that was ""it was better than looking out the window""."
3,Nice Nostalgic remembrance,"My country school was not featured/mentioned in the book. No matter which country school one attended, the things that took place were the same, no matter the part of the country you were in. The chores students did, the lunches, the teachers, the special programs, the recesses with each season. I am proud to have been in that elite group of having attended a country school, Park School, Clark County, Wisconsin. I took the book along to our last school reunion for people to look at."
4,Excellent Photos,"I am in agreement with the above review, with the addition of recommending the book for its fine collection of photographs of various styles of both ancient and modern phurbas. No other book on the subject comes near to the collection of phurbas displayed. Unfortunately it's marred by the lack of real understanding of the practice itself."
5,Ragman,Read this years ago -very well written-honest. If you like this type you will love the book Harpo Speaks -6 stars.
2,"I wanted to like it, really","Unfortunately, I found the book to be lacking in substance and almost obsessively fawning of some guy called Lewis Bostwick of the Berkeley Psychic Institute (which I never heard of).This book was a waste of money; I personally got more out of, say, Sonia Choquette's bookThe Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul."
2,You Are Psycic: The Art of Clairvoyant Reading & Healing,"I purchased 3 of Debra's books and I am not impressed with the first one that I have started to read ~ You Are Psycic: The Art of Clairvoyant Reading & Healing. Very disappointed and unfortunately if it does not get better, I will be returning the other two for a refund."
3,Ok book ....I've read better....,Ok book ....I've read better....I donated it to my local library. There are so many books on this topic this one was not anything special in my opinion!~
2,NO GOOD!!,"i bought this book for my girlfriend to help her understand and strengthen her abilities. we quickly discovered that it is mostly nonsense!debra katz obviously has very specific routines that help her tap into her psychic self, but that doesn't mean those techniques will work for everyone. she attempts to teach these almost obsessive-compulsive rituals but she goes off on tangents and often does not make much sense. also she talks about god a lot - which is fine, if that's what you're into; but we were looking for something based on fact and science rather than religion.she did, however, give some helpful advice on the business aspect of things (how to go about charging for readings, etc). other than that this book was pretty disappointing.if you are truly interested in learning about your abilities and how to use them, i would highly recommend the book written by Pete A. Sanders by the same name You Are Psychic!."
4,True expressions of what it means to pastor,"I heard Michael Lindvall read some of these stories before the book was published and I'd been waiting over a year for my copy.The stories are a little uneven and none are as funny as some in the first book, but I'm very happy to have my copy and I'll share it with others at my Presbyterian Church.The very best story is Our Organist. I cried when I first heard it and I cry reading it. The whole world needs to know of the openness of many churches.It is not an easy job to pastor especially in the small, rural church. Michael Lindvall expresses some of the doubts and triumphs that a minister feels."
3,Nice Dream Book,"Amercian Wooden Runabout was simply a nice dream book. It had some good background and historical information regarding the various boat producers which I found interesting. I noticed that most of the photos had apparently been taken from several boating magazines and inter-spursed throughout the book.It was as, I have said...""a nice dream book"". It should be re-formated with additional photos for a larger coffee-table stlye book to enhance the boater's interest and morning conversations over a cup of hot coffee and scone."
3,Head Ti.175 XL Disappointed,"I have used my racquet for four months or about 16 times. I'm an intermediate 50 year old player and I do not intentionally bang the racquet against the wall or floor. Last week the strings broke during a volley rendering the racquet useless. For the money, I would have expected a lot more durability. Regarding the $69.00 I spent, I feel that it was a complete waste of money. Now I have to spend another $40.00 to restring it - making it a $109.00 purchase. In hindsight, it's not worth $20.00 let alone the original $69.00 spent.Update: After getting it re-strung through Sports Authority (Boulder area) the racquet has held up very well even with some rough and tumble volleys. The frame is mid-weight and much stronger than I expected."
3,It's okay,"This racquet is a good beginner racquet for the price. The guard on the outer edges seems to be a little week. I recommend using a dampener with it to avoid a sore arm.For the price on Amazon, you cannot go wrong with this racquet. For a more experienced player, something a little more high end would be in order."
4,Great racquet!,The Head Ti.175 XL is a great mid-level racquet. My husband and I both have one and our game has greatly improved!
2,Faulty racket guard,"The top guard/the cover that protects the racket from scratching and bending broke after couple games. Even though it is a decent racket, the once i got was low quality."
4,Great Racquet,"This was my first racquet, and I have been very pleased with how it has preformed. Ive never felt any type of soreness after many games. The outer plastic guard is VERY weak, and after 5 months of use I need to replace it, its cracked in multiple places; but it has not effected the effectiveness of the racquet. Although anyone who has held my racquet has told me how amazed they are with how light it was."
4,Great racquet -- terrible frame protector,"The racquet is really great -- light weight, high power. The only defect is as has been mentioned where the frame protector strip is perforated on top and breaks easily."
3,This is not a book for an average reader.,"This is a book for an Engineer, Chemist, or Scientist, who knows a great deal about chemistry. It is very technical, and the ordinary reader would put it down quickly. It is very informative for the one who knows chemistry, mining, and geology."
4,"Excellent photographs, but...","If you are a stickler for proper spelling and grammar, this is not the book for you as there are countless errors. There are also instances where the text is describing a photograph and abruptly ends without the sentence being finished. That being said, if you are interested in the FFL and like really good photography, then this is the book for you. Despite the errors I am happy I purchased the book."
5,FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION EXCELLANCE,"THIS BOOK IS A DEFINITE FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR GREAT PICTURES AND GREAT INFORMATION ON THE 2 REP OF THE FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION. IT WAS A PLEASURE TO READ, AND I'M SURE THE FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION AND THE ELITE TROOPS OF THE 2 REP WOULD BE PROUD OF THIS BOOK."
1,Lauren Wood,"If you liked the cool jazzy sound of ""Please Don't Go"" and ""Fallen"" from Lauren Wood in the 1980s, you probably won't like the standard rock 'n' roll instrumentals and lyrics of this new album. The bonus track of ""Fallen"" simply doesn't belong with the twelve new tracks. I'm sad to see such a bendable voice as Wood's get lost in all too familiar rock licks. She can do so much in modulating her voice, that to hear thse songs indicates a loss of direction for her. I hope she'll return to what made her distinctive."
2,Fallen and she can't get up,"I love Lauren Wood. A deep voice, clever lyrics, very listenable, kind of a smoky, cool feeling to her music. I caught that feeling on previous releases long ago, and the magic is just not here. How many times will Fallen be on her releases? This CD sounds like one long song with a few breaks. Nothing jumps off the disc. Missing energy, action, the excitement I think she's still got. Let it out! Incidentally, if you like Lauren, you'd love Jann Arden. Give her a listen, too."
3,Lauren Wood,Bought this CD for a special song and loved hearing all the songs Lauren sings to on this cd. It's great to play during a dinner or when some friends are over.
5,The lost art of Popsong crafting,"This would be Lauren Wood's fifth album outing, if you count the Chunky, Novi, and Ernie LPs in the late 70s. She's always written highly listenable, sometimes incurably infectious melodies, and worked with some of the best producers in pop music. This time she's at the helm, and as always, has worked up 12 songs that only grow more listenable with each play. There is a conceptual late 60s feel, recalling the Beatles at their most creative, that becomes evident when bass riffs, recording techniques, East Indian influences, playful lyrics and lush harmonies work their way up from the always sweet, sometimes plaintive melodies. There is no finer composer/lyricist/performer in pop music, and this CD deserves attention."
5,A juvenile mystery of intrigue and suspense,"When their father, falls ill with debilitating depression, and their mother needs to leave town to be with him, Noel , Clara and Bosie move in with their strange grandparents whom they have never met before.This is a hard enough adaptation, but real difficulties arise when their mysterious cousin,David, their grandfather's grandchild from a previous marriage comes to stay.David is clearly a sociopath, and after briefly befriending Clara and Bosie, keeps the whole family as virtual hostages, under threat, while he takes on the roll as master of the house, in a macabre game of ""happy Families"".His abuse of everyone grows, as things become more and more tense, towards the final climax.The children cope as best they can with this frightening ordeal as their grandparents seem unable to act, and their parents know nothing about the bizarre situation.A thrilling juvenile mystery. Touches on issues such as mental illness, control, and abuse."
2,No time to waste....,"All I have to say about this book, is that you shouldn't waste your time trying to read this boring story. I couldn't really indulge it because it was so slow and boring, and not at all scary. I wanted something good, something to chill me, but I guess not eveyone is as good as Ira Levin or Stephen King. Avoid this book if possible."
2,Too many plot twists,I loved the first half of the book... but when things start to get good everything goes horribly and unfix-ably wrong. For the second half of the book the hero and heroine barely see each other.
5,Love Love Love it,One of my very favorite books by Karen Ranney. It's from her early books and is a must read if you like her books now.
5,A Keeper!,"This book is what historical romance is all about. Passion, love, redemption as well as the pain of war are all included in this book. Reading this book can bring tears to your eyes and laughter as well. Hard to believe this is a first book."
3,.,"There is nothing really wrong with the book, it's all good but it just isn't that fun to read. Ranney tells you the story instead of letting you experience it."
5,A must have book for the writer and teacher,I have been writing and teaching writing and workshops for 12 years. Michael's book is one of those I can't get by without. Simple enough for kids and as valuable for beginners and advanced writers. I love it!
5,Yummy! Yummy! Yummy!,"The packages are very convenient for travelling -- just through a couple in the suitcase. The taste is suberb, a really guilty pleasure, and the price is good as well."
2,Alterations included,"While the visual aspects of these episodes appear true to the original series, the audio tracks appear to have been redone, updated. If, like me, you were looking forward to seeing (and hearing) the original unadulterated versions you saw as a kid, then I think you would find this a disappointment."
3,"old cartoons, that look good still today","Astro boy, is as great as old cartoons from the 60s, up to the year of 2009 animation I hope never changes, super heroes in this world today, we need them, I hope it never goes away, Good luck Astro boy in your new movie coming out in a movie soon, GOOD LUCK"
4,Dramatic story of the Texas Black Widow,"The story of Betty Lou Beets, the Texas Black Widow was a thrilling and interesting book. No detail was left untold, and the author seemed to describle the Black Widow for who she truly was, a cold-hearted killer. The chilling story of how she conspired to kill her husbands Jimmy Don Beets and Wayne Barker, each buried in a sleeping bag captures the readers attention from the very beginning. It is truly a book that you cannot put down. I reccommend this book for every fan of trhe true crime genre."
2,Not for starting. Only for Power Developers,"I paid $64 (with taxes) for the latest 3rd ed of this book. And I have been cursing myself for that now. I guess I didn't check the title keyword ""Handbook"". This book is only for Seasoned Access Developers who want to top off with tricks, tips, secrets and reusable code. For someone like me, who knows zilch about Access, this is not the starter book, that I thought it would be.I have now bought Alison Balter's ""Mastering Access97"" and in a few months would be somewhere so that I can go back to read Litwin's book."
5,Excelente! El mejor libro para desarrolladores!,"Tengo 2 años de Desarrollar Sistemas en MS Access 95 y 97. Compré la edición anterior de este libro (sobre MS Access 95) y le recomiendo comprar este libro a cualquiera que desee desarrollar aplicaciones profesionales en Access 97. Cuando salga la nueva edición (MS Access 2000), les aseguro que la compraré!"
5,Mammoth achievement,"The first edition was a landmark when it came out almost thirty years ago, setting new standards of comprehensiveness, clarity and readability. Now the fifth fully lives up to those standards. It manages to incorporate the thousands of advances that have taken place and the additional complexities that they entail, while remaining approachable and comprehensible. It is a fine tool for updating one's knowledge of the field."
1,Below average,Did not say product was being shipped. Gave no essential information when emailed. . . . . . . .
4,"Great, but Last 5 Chapters are Electronic","GREAT book, but the only problem is that the last 5 chapters are in PDF format on an attached CD rather than in print (they did this to make the book more portable). If you want the full print version, buy the Reference edition."
3,Cheaper than school's book store!,"This book is cheaper than the one at my expensive bookstore, so I found it here and purchased the book and also it is heavy and I take everywhere and its a great way to stay in shape."
5,Bruce Alberts THE CELL,"In my opinion, this book is the ""bible"" of molecular and cell biology. The two main advantages I found were the easy way of reading and a good design and pictures."
4,"Not really, but acceptable","The book arrive on time. The condition was great, however, the seller describe the textbook as brand new. When thinking of brand new, I am expecting Shrink wrap new. This textbook was indeed an open ""used"" new book. What I mean is, the book itself is in new condition with the exception of page fading (the paper was not pure white when compared to my buddy newly bought bookstore edition), but was already opened and the dvd separated already. The page fading I am ok with as well with the whole book, but the description should have been written as the book stands. Hence the 4 stars rather than 5.either way, book is great!"
5,GREAT BOOK!!!!,"yes, at first it was hard for me to understand, but that's only because i didn't understand the basics of biology yet. Trust, this book is amazing!!! Its so easy to follow: they don't jump from place to place like other books erm...microbiology (cough, cough)"
3,A Respect For Faith,"I have a great respect for the faith and belief systems of others. I also have a great respect for those so willing to layout their life story and aspire to reach for their life's ambitions. That is essentially what this story is about. Personally, I wasn't inspired so much by the story or the miracle of Avalon. While I can appreciate the soul put into writing this book, I can't in good conscious, say that I was inspired.~Bobbi~Just Us Girls[..]"
3,Not bad,"Not bad, but I have read better. It does have a lot of good pictures of the effects they are teaching and all in all this book is not bad, there are just so many others that I feel are better. Check out The ""DV Rebel Guide"" by Stu something or other or ""101 Digital Video hacks"", both I feel are better than this.Enjoy!"
5,Dig It,"This book is full of great ideas for conveying your vision to it's fullest extent. Some techniques could use a little bit more explanation, but all in all a great outline for imaginative capture and edit techniques."
2,Take a pass on this one,"There are a view techniques described in this book that might come in handy someday, but the descriptions are not particularly thorough. The bottom line: this will make a good coffee table book but don't expect to learn too much."
3,Oh .. OK .. another one of those books ..,"I had great visions and expectations of sugarplums dancing in my head when I bought this book about the governess, but ... unfortunately I was rather sorely disappointed ....Well, the first thing is that the heroine of the book Miss Hunnicut ( don't ya just love those names ) is really the governess of nothing, as there are NO young people in this book. She gets hired by a recluse couple living in that ubiquitious English mansion, on an island no less, in Scotland, and, I could only imagine they made it an island to avoid having to explain why the governess couldn't escape ......The story is actually quite simple as Miss Hunnicut gets used and abused by not only her employers but also some ephemeral, whatever that is, spirits ....I gave the book 3 stars since I guess it would be a good book if you really don't want to think while you read..."
5,An unforgettable read from the FemDom genre,"The story involves a young man who comes under the control of a sadistic Governess and her total subjugation of him over a period of several years... It is filled with tales of his punishment, humilation and torture at her hands. A truly wonderful read and one of the finest examples of this genre. You won't be disappointed with this book."
4,Establishing your own foundry,C. W. Ammen has done an admirable job of condensing the three foundry trades apprenticeships into a paperback. If ever a live steamer or inventor wanted to set up a small foundry this would be the book to buy.Mr Ammen knows his business and how to teach it but he is not a technical writer. You will have to live with the book's faults. It's poorly edited and there are a good many clumsy sentances and examples of bad grammar.Do not let these faults distract you from the narrative. A good industrial craftsman with little knowledge of foundry practice can follow the instructions given to ultimately produce practice sand castings of most any metal of good quality.
2,Justryin,"This book seems to spend more time relating the authors knowledge of the matter and never conveying that knowledge to the user. He goes on about all the sand that can be found naturally but I didn't get the impression I could go to a creek bed and find anything appropriate without a lifetime of practice. As I was interested in doing this as a beginner, I found this book to be much less than helpful."
4,The Complete Handbook of Sand Casting,Perhaps not totally complete but more complete than any other sand casting book I have read. This stupid box requires four more words so these will do!!!!
1,Poor Job,Tried to extract diesel fluid on various ocassions. System failed to do it's job. Very disapointed.
1,Overpriced underperformer,"I bought this locally, after trying a much cheaper siphon system that was even more useless. As others have mentioned, this item will not consistently hold a vacuum right out of the box. Without modifying the unit in such a way as to make it unreturnable (and making it even more expensive), this item will not function.Save your money and time, either buy something metal, or continue doing changes the same way. Unless you have a vehicle with a top-mounted filter, you'll be getting underneath the vehicle anyway."
3,Good Stories by a Popular Writer,"The book arrived promptly and I am enjoying the stories, but the pages of the book are very yellow and aged. Also the print is small and difficult to read."
5,"Roberts, Three Complete Novels",I am a Nora Roberts fan and was not disappointed with the enclosed three novels. Good reading for a summer afternoon.
5,Very Good Reads,"If you are an avid reader as I aa and a Nora Roberts fan too, you can't beat these three great books combined in one volume.I am certain that you will enjoy these three earlier works by Nora Roberts."
3,Nice cover material. Needs more material.,"Nice to find a cover for this large grill.Only wish it covered more deeply, so it would also cover the spatula and other tools I have hanging from the grill. As is, they get dirty. Just look at the photo, and decide if it works for you."
5,Excellent product,This product was not available at any local stores so I ordered from Amazon with overnight shipping and it arrived on time for my contractor to install. The shower curtain rod is heavy duty and should last many years. I would suggest also purchasing the upright bracket as it is necessary for holding a shower curtain.
4,a great cd,very atmospheric. trancelike. reminiscent of the really good nico albums. believe it or not.
5,Fascinating!,"Interesting book about a globe trotter with the nose for frauds who may have found the real thing. Used, arrived in expected condition."
1,The biggest NON-BUY ever!,"I did not like this book at all. Shields had a very good idea when he went into the season for writing this book. A little info, I am a basketball PHANATIC (I mean it!) and I live in Seattle, not to mention I am very intrigued by the relationship between race and the NBA and sports in general. I would have liked to give this book 0 stars but this format is too generous.What started out as a topic that I was excited to read about quickly turned into a horrendously slanted, overly cluttered and boring book! One of the worst parts of this book is the fact that it has some of the most random blips that you will ever read! To think that the author is a professor at UW is scary, as he is much more suited to be a Marxist theorist in the Sociology department.If you read the book and like it, good for you, but I was not a fan at ALL. 0%."
1,Racial Paranoia!,"I found this book to be pure garbage. Shields manages to find racial conflict in every mundane situation imaginable. A chronicle of the Sonics? It seems to be a homage to Gary Payton. Like I care if Shields has a fantasy in his bedroom of being Payton while he is making love to his wife! It only gets worse from there. Save your money, buy a ticket to a game, and if everyone is lucky Shields will give up his dream of being a quality author! It would be a stretch to give this bomb zero stars, but a one is the lowest choice I had."
3,WHAT THE NBA&SOCIETY AT LARGE ARE AFRAID OF,THis is a Very well Done Book.I've felt Like The NBA Has Been one Big Plantation just Like Hollywood&The Entertainment Business.Why? Because While Many Will Say Black Atheletes are The Majority on The Court or Field it's The Same in Manegement&Ownership.Master To Field Worker Mentality.when Coaches with Experience get Jobs or who have never Played that's a Hook Up.but for the World that's True Affirmative-Action.the way it is Played Out in The Media.Look out in The Stands that is Very Telling.Shields does a Good Job Here.It's The Same Old Same Old Good Enough Too Entertain in the Buliding but not Good Enough Too Own it.
2,Some real insight into white male thoughts on black men,"I found Mr. Shields' journal irrelevant at times, and the mixture of his personal life and basketball was not a good one. What I did like, however, was the real insight into what is going on in a white man's head when he's watching, in awe, black men he has very little respect for off court. He reveals how black athletes are objectified by the media, while being ridiculed in the ""secret media club"". It's sad, and sadder because of the tone of the book. Perhaps the author's inclusion of his ""family life"" was an attempt to make him seem more ""human"" to his readers."
1,David Shields' Opinion.. Why Should I Care?,"It's hard to fault someone for their opinions.. but reading Black Planet had me doing just that. Shields seems intent on viewing a very complex issue in the simplest of terms. Whites are bad. Blacks are good. He dotes on Gary Payton for chapters.. yet turns down the chance to attend several Sonics games with another fan.. simply because the man works at a bowling alley. I'm not exactly sure why this book was written.. or published for that matter.. but if it's helped David Shields get over his feelings of guilt for being born white, I'm glad for him. Too bad the rest of us were subjected to this mindless piece of claptrap."
2,Nice in theory,"This lock is great in theory. If it clicks into place properly, it will keep your child locked inside, while still permitting entry from the outside. HOWEVER, on my door handles (which look just like the picture's)when you disengaged the lock, pushed the handle down, and pulled the door towards you (to open it), the lever part of the lock would slide towards you and the lock usually didn't automatically reset afterwards (defeating the purpose). It was quite annoying. They do provide foam for the inside to get a better fit, but even using that and stuffing part of a paper towel inside, this kept happening. Eventually, it pulled the top part of the lock (which adheres to the door itself) off the door.I never review any products, but I felt I should for this one since I bought it based on relatively positive overall reviews.Too bad there don't seem to be more options out there.Now to see if I can get a refund..."
4,"Works great for us, but may need additional padding inside handle cover","This item has worked very well for us to keep our 20 month old from opening several doors. However, if you have very thin door handles, you may need to tape some cardboard around the handles to pad them up enough to make sure this snaps back into place.It only took me about 30 minutes to install 6 of these, so I'm not so sure about the other reviewer's comment. We always open these one handed, so that our son doesn't figure out how to open it -- his hands are too small to do it with one hand. If he saw us do it with two, he would probably figure it out!The reviewers who wrote that this won't work with left-handed doors or who think it will lock you out from the other side are clueless. This item can be used with either side door, when installed on the side of an interior door without a lock it can be set up to allow access to the hole for unlocking a locked door, and it does not lock the door from the other side."
1,Lock is easily defeated,"You definitely can't rely on it keeping a child from opening the door. Our 21 month old simply puts her finger into the bottom of the handle cover and pulls the handle down. It isn't the ""official"" way to unlock the door but no one told her that."
1,Not worth the effort,"What a piece of junk! It installed quickly, but my two year old opened it within one minute of seeing it. Blah."
2,30 minutes to install 10 seconds to defeat,"It took my 3 1/2-year-old 10 seconds to defeat this. It took me about 30 minutes to install it.Pretty ineffective, as far as I'm concerned. Your mileage may vary."
5,Lever locks work great!,"Great product...easy to install, keeps the kids out of our pantry and the closet where we keep the toys with little pieces! My kids basically ignore them. If they wanted to get in badly enough, though, they probably could figure them out. But for now, they are at least a deterrent. We are very happy with them."
4,it works...,"I installed this using the adhesive, and it works. It looked confusing to install, but it wasn't that bad once I got started. It's the only thing I have found for this type of door handle.You do have to make sure it relatches after you open the door and sometimes the lock will twist in a funny way, but that is easy to fix."
1,can't use,my door handle was to the left and therefore could not use although product said that this lever could be used on all lever handles--shipping costs were more than item purchased so it would cost me way too much to try to return
3,Fits door but locks you in,"We wanted to use this to protect our baby from the basement door. However, it prevents the door from being opened from the other side. There is no way to temporarily disable the mechanism, so anyone venturing down the basement could become trapped. Be careful!"
4,Works great if your handles are exactly like the picture!,This would be a great item except it isn't clear that it only works on handles that are pointing to the right. Our doors have the handles going to the left leaving this item useless for us.
2,only works on some levers,This didn't fit on the levers on our home. I wouldn't recommend this product unless your door lever looks similar to the one pictured.
2,It's alright,Product works great as far as the nechanical function. The only bad part is my 18 month old figured out how to operate it and can now get into the bathroom.
5,Excellent child lock for lever type door handle,"I tried a few different level-door locks to prevent our two-year old from gaining entry into unwanted places. This was truly the onlydoor lock that worked. The fact that it looks nice is a bonus. I highly recommend this door latch. The others for lever handles, simply do notwork. I give this product 5-starts! Good job!A Father and handyman."
1,NOT child proof!,"My two year old figured out how to open within minutes. Now we have 2 doors that she can still open, but now we have holes from the screws we used to install the ""no tools needed"" product. Do not purchase!"
1,Disappointed in this lock,"While it only took my husband about 10 minutes to install, it took my toddler about 45 seconds to figure out how to open it. Plus when you pull the door closed the bottom housing slips towards you and then the lock doesn't drop back into the track. So you have to close the door and then push the whole thing back together again to get the lock to engage. Maybe I should ask my 2 year old how to close the door with it on, since she is so adept at opening the door with it on!! Too bad, it was a good thought, but we'll have to try something else."
2,My 2 year old defeated these locks.,"As many other reviewers have noted, once the child is tall enough and have seen how to defeat the door locks the product becomes useless. Once they become coordinated enough they will open the door faster than an adult who has never seen the lock. Save your money, as this will only buy you a few months before your smart toddler figures it out...Also the adhesive on the backing will eventually give out to the Toddler trying to yank the handle down... so Save your money and buy your cute kid some Ice cream instead. 8-)"
1,Garbage,Not worth the money unless you just want another handle and lock set up. Thought this would be different but it requires use of its lock part to keep kids from opening doors. Wasted money on the product.
2,ProTools LE CSi Starter,"Warning: this turorial is primarily created for MUSIC recording, mixing, and mastering. There is nothing here for editing or mixing to picture. The pace of instruction is so fast that the beginner will be constantly stopping play back to digest each process. Plugins and patching are delt with in a very superfical and rapid manner allowing little time for the viewer to recreate the actions on their own ProTools sessions."
3,"Conspiracies, Secret Societies, Macho Cops . . .","David D. Ross looks at a near-term future. Written towards the end of the cold war, he envisions the United States is now Fortress America, an increasingly isolationist and technophobic state. Resting on its existing technological base, it innovates just enough to remain superior to the cunning Soviets. While certain high profile scientists are assassinated, a mysterious blight threatens the South American food supplies, and there's no reason why the blight shouldn't move across the border into the fortress.David D. Ross's novels relies on a few too many hoary cliches, and it feels like he tries to throw in every science-fictional idea that he can think of, so a lot of it seems like overkill. But you can't go too badly with a plot that's this thick with assassins, intrigue, politics, core-taps, mega-corporations, and drug-addled saboteurs."
3,Everybody Makes Mistakes,"Even executioners have bad days. Though I would hardly call many of these blunders ""ghastly"", the stories do reveal that accidents happen even when the goal is to end a life.The book begins with a handy explanation of the types of executions employed throughout human history. After this, sections are devoted to mishaps in the specific types of executions. Whether it is modern technology or focus of the author's research, most of the executions documented seem to be pre-twentieth century. Since beheadings and hangings were far from an exact science, it would be logical for there to be a large collection of these mishaps.Perhaps the stories that are most entertaining are the tales of those who eventually walked away from their own execution after being thought dead. Read over a series of a few days, the book is rather monotonous. The book is more informative than entertaining."
3,Mr. Abbot does it again,"Another book of appalling anecdotes, about executions gone dreadfully wrong. Mr Abbot demonstrates that even something as horrific as burning at the stake can be screwed up-- and made worse!"
4,Great Club!,"I have used the Texan Titanium 3-wood, and it has proven to be a very effective club for me. I like its balanced weighting."
3,Comprehensive But Laborious Account,"This is a comprehensive account of much that is known about British children evacuated to North America during WW11. It is, however, very laborious reading, probably too dull for anyone without a special interest in the subject. For a more entertaining account of one boy's experience, read AMERICA LOST AND FOUND: AN ENGLISH BOY'S WARTIME ADVENTURE IN THE NEW WORLD BY Anthony Bailey."
