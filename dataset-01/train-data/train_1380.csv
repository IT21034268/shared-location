2,Flat Matress,"After comparisons between Fat Mattress and some favorite groups, I bought this disappointment ""in the blind."" Playing it once, it's kind of like Bruce-you-know-who's last album, with every song sounding almost exactly the same. I think I'll opt for something more honest, like John Mellencamp's latest. This one was not a winner."
4,From Geek to Writer,"Just A Geek, written by Wil Wheaton is a wonderful read. Whether or not you are a Star Trek fan, I feel Mr. Wheaton has something to offer every audience. This book is not about Star Trek, or Sci Fi it is a book about a young man's struggle as a young actor, through adolescence to adulthood, to find himself and begin a new chapter in his life. It is a feel good book, Mr. Wheaton just grabs your mind and your heart and pulls you right in. Cons: A review of his entries from Mr. Wheatons website, if you are an avid reader of his website you have already read half the book, but he does add background for each entry which makes the book so cool. So if you want to laugh, cry, or chear someone on the Just A Geek, by Wil Wheaton is a great read."
4,Touching and insightful,"I truly enjoyed Wil Wheaton's unwavering look at his life post Star Trek The Next Generation and how he eventually relearns to love trek and himself. There were many parts of the book that I found myself touched and close to heartbreak when Mr. Wheaton goes back and rereads parts of his blog only to realizes just how insecure he was.A story about growth and accepting who you are and your past. My only critique is that there are large sections of the book are taken directly from his blog. I wish all the material was new; however, then you may not have had the insightful feel of the novel. Either way, a great read and definitely recommended."
5,Happy Just A Geek Reader,"Wil has written an absolutely excellent autobiographical book. The vulnerability of his frank honesty and foibles had me hooked from word to word, paragraph to paragraph and chapter to chapter. Bill Clinton (and nearly every other famous/celebrity autobiographer) needs to take ""how to write about your life"" lessons from Wil Wheaton!Trust me, don't try to think of reasons not to read it. Don't limit it to Star Trek TNG. Even if you are a WWDN weblog fan, don't think you have already read this book through Wil's blog. Trust me, you haven't. JAG is much better!"
4,"Good stories, not enough details...","Wil is all over the map in this book, but understandably so since it's mostly expanded versions of posts from his blog and his commentary on making them. It's good material, however it doesn't go into deep enough detail in many of the stories, leaving you thinking ""That's good, but is that really it?"" The material could use more spicing up, or at least some deeper thoughts on the subject. He could have made the book twice as long and used smaller print without it seeming like too much, really. A for effort, B- for execution. Still, very much worth reading."
4,As smart and funny as you'd hope,"I have read Wil's blog and listened to him play D&D;, but I haven't been able to find one of his books locally. I asked it to be made available on the Kindle, and lo, it has come to pass.I was impressed with Wil's honesty and openness in his writing, and in his early chapters the insecurity that he felt after leaving TNG is well expressed. One thing that I see in his writing that I'm really pleased with is how he respects his past and can see how it influences him, and he also looks ahead and shows hope in the influences he can give his stepchildren.I don't want to use the words ""reinvented"" or ""matured"" to describe what happens in this book as much as ""evolution."" Wil 'the actor' becomes Wil 'the writer', and I think we are richer for it."
3,Poor Wil Wheaton,"Well, I read this because I've always felt that Wil got a beating from fans of Star Trek for things that weren't his fault--people identified him with his know-it-all, annoying, whiny character on TNG.Well, I'm starting to think they might've been on to something.""Just a Geek"" seemed to me to be nothing more than Wil Wheaton wallowing around in his own self-pity, exposing his ""journey of self discovery"" to the world so that we can all appreciate how hard stardom has been on Wil. Yes, child stars do suffer--but as child stars go, Wil has suffered a lot less than most.Over all, I came away from ""Just a Geek"" disliking Wheaton a lot more than I did."
1,This one is headed for my trash can!,"Wil who is a prolific blogger and self-proclaimed geek obviously could not transfer his talents to this dull and prosaic volume. I found the writing obvious and pretentious. If you are a fan, then you don't want to read this or you just may find yourself questioning why. Pass this one up!"
5,Amazing!,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. It's honest and heartfelt, and through it all tells the tale of what it's like to be a real person under the ""actor"" title. It brought a friend of mine to tears, but expect to laugh as well."
5,Worthy reading from Uncle Willie,"Read all the other reviews and all I have to say is ""what they say""...And something else > this is a potent read for anyone who has ever wondered about the past, the voices in their head, the visions in their heart and perhaps, just maybe, what they want to do when they ""grow up""...Great Work WW! - you is the beacon man!Peaxe,Rev. D."
3,Hubby liked it..,"Picked it up for my husband to have something to browse when he wanted to take his mind off of work. He read through this book pretty quickly. I personally am not a fan of Will Wheaton but in the 'tech / geek' world he's apparently pretty important and that was the reason for picking it off of his Wishlist. He claimed he enjoyed it, but it wound up at the bottom of the book pile so I can't say for sure how much he actually DID enjoy the book."
4,a good read,"when you have some free time or when you just like to read, this is a good book to have. I recommand to all the geeks out there."
5,Positively wonderful,"Finished this book last night. I don't know how he does it but when I was reading this book and his other book ""Dancing Barefoot"" I felt like I was a fly on the wall, seeing what he was seeing and I enjoyed every minute of it."
5,A truly unique perspective,"The reason I love Wil Wheaton's site and books is that he lays it all out there. It's like listening to one of your close buddies tell you a frickin' unbelievable story. He's a normal guy who's lived an extraordinary life, and you never have the feeling that there's something he's not telling. I highly recommend Just a Geek, Dancing Barefoot, and his website!"
3,You've gotta be kidding me!,"One question I'd like to pose to Mr. Wheaton is this:What is the purpose of this book and why?The book tries to read like a self journey but it falls short. I know my saying this will probably upset those who worship at the temple of Wil but it lacks so much. I understand the attempt here, this poor kid is trying to reclaim what is rightfully his but refuses to accept that it's gone and will never come back. Wil Wheaton is a tragic character, trying to hold on to the last vestiges (if there are any) of a career and life that will no longer exist for him. This is a man who constantly needs reassurance from others when he simply needs only to look within himself.JAG is a so so read but like his fans, I expected rapture but no such luck. I don't know who to feel sorry for: Mr. Wheaton or the trees that made this drivel possible."
3,"Nice red and intresting life story, but nothing more","Wil Wheaton has made a greate work to write this biographic book. it is a nice read, if you have time for it.However this bok not directly about to be a geek. This book is about a life some abit geeky person."
5,"FUN, FUN, FUN!!","I homeschool ALL my 7 kids (4 are through college & grown, 3 remain, ages 9 -15) My 9 year old is in Algebra 1, & my 15 year old is in Calculus & physics, so they keep me going looking for ways to incorporate ""learning"" new info or reviewing ""past"" studies, without it being sooooo dry & boring! Let's face it some things just are tedious!! You would be surprised at the people who cannot name all the states! So this is a remarkably refreshing way to ""review"" or learn the States, almost effortlessly! A friend suggested this book, & we were very pleased with the results!! Give it a try, you should be delighted, as was I! I just left it in trhe bathroom & REMOVED their current issue of ""outdoorLife"" Ha Ha, they actually had NO other choice, but to peruse or NOT!!!! :-)"
1,Fighting Mad Peter Fonda,"The movie I recieved had Peter Fonda's picture on the packaging and CD. However, once I played the movie it had some other movie in it. Peter Fonda was not in the movie I recieved. Bad move, I would not recommend this seller."
3,A letdown,"I understand that artists need to evolve; there's no point in being formulaic. And obviously, the title indicates that Neil Hannon wants to move in a new direction. However, I found myself bored and disappointed with this album by The Divine Comedy, especially after the sardonic and intelligent chamber music I fell in love with on albums like Promenade and Casanova. If you're new to this band, be advised that they didn't always sound like a decent (but dull) alternative rock group, they produced some very witty and memorable songs about foreign films, books, seafood, meeting God while stuck on a ferris wheel, and, of course, love. Granted, this isn't a terrible album, but it didn't do for me what my first listen of Casanova did. I will miss the old Divine Comedy."
4,"Oh, Neil...we didn't need more Radiohead","Like lots of good musicians with slightly eccentric styles, Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy has made the grave misstep of trying to make a more conventional album. On this outing, Hannon has trimmed away all the flourishes, winks, and lush orchestration that made the Divine Comedy such a pleasure, replacing it with Radiohead-haze tinged with Pulp-y trip hop. That said, this is a very good album, for what it is. If you like things like 'OK Computer', you might like this.That said, pick up any of the other Divine Comedy albums if you want to see what the cult of fans is so taken with."
4,I Am The Author Of This Book,"From the back cover blurb: ""In 'Blue Notes' Martin Farkus comes home. Home to the Twelve Step movement that saved his life in 1981 and again in 2004. In his first book, 'When You're A Fool,' he was estranged from the movement and therein lies the weakness of that work. Here, in the tradition of great works like the 'Pensees' of Blaise Pascal and Thoreau's journals (though Farkus would never claim to be worthy of touching the hem of those authors' garments...) are a compendium of thoughts on a wide-ranging field of subjects. And just thoughts from everyday life. Comedy, tragedy, the quotidian, something for everyone. Original thoughts and remembrances and thoughts of great writers of past and present. A book of thoughts meant to enrich the life of the reader. Dedicated to his own mother, Dorothy Farkus, and to his heavenly Mother, Mary Immaculate, the Lady in Blue, the Queen of Heaven. So come to the feast! All are invited."""
4,"medium to medium fast, tite & clean as usual minus the mush","A favorite amongst my ""songs to hear before i surf collection"".Hot Rod Lincoln, Mary, Box, Bubblegum the whole album's pretty good. It came out a decade ago and to me is still stronger than most of the albums produced by the punk rock starter kit's of today."
3,Disappointment,I am a big Will Rogers fan but found this book quite boring with few memorable quotes. I did get a bit more insight to his character than I had known but found myself skimming through most of the passages looking for something entertaining. There are other Will Rogers books that are far more interesting and entertaining.
3,Dissapointing,"I'm still wondering why Ben and Virgin are re-releasing so many tracks. Strawberry Fields has now been released on several different cds and singles. The Amen Omen has now been released on two or three different singles, and I'm clueless as to why anyone would be interested in a ""radio edit"" of Diamonds on the Inside.That said, the two live tracks (which are essentially the only ""new"" material on the EP) are very nice. Is it worth $22 for two live recordings? If I were you, I'd just save your money and buy the new Hollywood Bowl DVD that comes out this month."
5,Extremely good book!!,"The Death of Innocents is really one of the best true crime books that I've read. It is quite detailed and complete, while the science presented is neither too dumbed down or above understanding. I highly recommend this book!! It is also a VERY interesting look into the workings of science when money is a motivator."
4,A marvelous picture of medicine and murder,Not exactly easy reading. The whole section on the rise and fall (or at least questionable) of the apnea theory was a little bias to me. But a great narration nevertheless. The care taken and amount of research done certainly made this book a model of `journalistic-novel' committed to exploring the various sides of the story.
3,"A compelling story, and another, and another and another","Firstman and Talan are obviously very talented and thorough researchers, but I was left wishing their editor had taken a little heavier hand and trimmed the book by about 30 percent. The excruciating detail of who said what to whom at every medical conference could have been pared and the discussion of Steinschneider's scientific fraud could have been streamlined quite a bit as well. This is the authoritative work on a sad chapter in pediatric medicine, but it's also a courtroom drama, a hospital drama and a psychodrama. Too much of a good thing, I'm afraid, but I did manage to plow through the whole 600 pages."
4,kinda flimsy but works great,"The metal tabs last and last and thats whats important. With the oher ones , the metal tabs break off after opening and closing a fe times. These are good."
2,not microwave safe,"I love the look of these mugs so I purchased a large set with dishes at TJMaxx. I see these mugs there frequently for $3.99 each. They are a good size and wash well in dishwasher. They are definitely easier to chip than my Chaleur mugs I've had for 15 years.I give these mugs, and dishes as well, only 2 stars beacause it is impossible to microwave with them. There must be some metal in the glaze, as if you try to make tea in one of these cups, it will get so hot that you will not be able to pick it up. Same goes for heating up anything on a plate. This is a really bad feature for dishware and I'm sure it's not good for your microwave.I've been regretting buying these for a year now, and hope I can save somebody else the mistake. I actually get excited when one chips as I don't feel so bad about tossing it in the garbage. One day ,soon, I will have had enough and the whole set will go to the curb..."
3,Be careful of manufacture,"Just a warning--not all mugs are made the same. Some are made in Spain, others in Germany. The Germany makes, in general, are a bit more delicate/finer. Personally, prefer these. The Spanish ones are less refined. I didn't know there was such a huge difference, but the mugs really are different. I only wish there were some way of finding out where the things are made before purchasing."
1,broken cups arrived,i bought a set of 4. two of those arrived broken to pieces :( which makes these cups SUPER expensive ...
1,Profoundly Disappointed,"I bought four sets of these for the office. The color is great, and the build quality is German.But they are a disaster! If you put one in the microwave for one minute, you will get second degree burns, the color turns brown, the glaze cracks and some bad tasting white cruft comes through the cracks.Now I ask you, isn't it a fair assumption that a coffee mug will be used in a microwave? Is it a fair assumption that the brand and cost of these would lead you to believe they can actually be used?"
2,Not Microwave Compatible,I bought eight because I liked the colors and the lightweight feel. But ... I tend to reheat my coffee in a microwave and discovered that they're too hot to handle after microwaving. I tried the microwave test (i.e. place empty mug in microwave along with a pyrex beaker filled with water and zap for one minute). The mug was hot indicating that it's not microwave compatible (metals/water in ceramic and/or glaze?). Two of the mugs spontaneously chipped as well.
5,Quality mug!,I ordered a 4 piece set of these mugs and was so delighted I ordered four more.They are well made and comfortable to handle...and the nice color is great!
5,Mugs with color,Searched forever trying to find plain mugs that had the perfect color for a Christmas gift. Finally found these. They were exactly what I wanted!
4,Would have loved to give it 5 stars.....,"But, some of the people who wrote earlier are right, there is ""something"" missing, although after listening to this record umpteen times, I can still not put my finger on it. I think it may be the fact, for me at least, that the first half of the album is really dry, and just does not have a Intolerence or eulogy to get the album rocking. The Grudge attempts this, but the song loses me somewhere. Ticks, Lateralus, and Reflection are by far the strongest tracks, with Triad right in there. Ticks has the power, Lateralus has the riff, and Reflection hass that sonic ambience that I love, much like 3rd Eye (3rd Eye is a better track though). Still the more I listen, the more things I discover. This album may hold me over for the summer......"
2,Not quite what I expected,"I got this disc the day it came out. I can honestly say I haven't been able to sit down and listen to it all at once. The songs are dragged out and indistinguishable from one to the next. While not expecting Tool to sound like they did in the past, I did think that there would be a little more. I fully support their development and growth. Musically, they tried to polish it too much. It sounds very thought out - but lacks any sort of passion."
3,CD doesn't play on my machine,"I had to reburn and shorten the CD, change the track order to make it play. I tried it on 2 other players and it wouldn't play."
2,Horrible,"By far the worst Tool album ever. I have been a Tool fan since their first EP, but this is the biggest let down I have experienced in music. There is no passion in the lyrics. It almost seems like this album is B-sides. You are paying for three to four songs at the most. I think Maynard put more effort into A Perfect Circle and eating his cereal than in this album. I have had it since the release date and I still don't like it after days of usage. This is the first Tool album I have to turn off. I can't listen to it from start to end. It is pretty much an instumental album. Hardly any voice at all."
2,DISSAPOINTING!!,"DISSAPOINTING!! I CAN UNDERSTAND THE HIGH MARKS FROM OTHER TOOL FANS. I MEAN THE ANTICIPATION FOR THIS ALBUM WAS TREMENDOUS, HELL YOU COULD OF PACKAGED THE BACKSTREET BOYS IN A TOOL COVER AND MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAID ""UH YOU HEAR THE NEW TOOL ALBUM ITS KIND OF DIFFERENT BUT TOOL ROCKS""!! YES IT IS DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS TOOL ALBUMS I MEAN WHERE IS THE ANGER THE AGRESSION THE TIGHT RIFFS, WHERE IS MAYNARDS ABSOLUTE POWER IN HIS LYRICS. HALF OF THE TIME YOU CAN'T EVEN HERE HIS VOICE OVER THE SCATTERD MUSIC! THIS IS NOT THE TOOL MUSIC YOU HAVE GROWN TO LOVE FOLKS. THIS IS A LOST VERSION OF A PERFECT CIRCLE, WICH ACTUALLY SOUNDS MORE LIKE TOOL THAN LATERLUS. ALL SAID IF I WANT SOME SMART ARTSIE ROCK I""LL THROW IN SOME PINK FLOYD OR RADIOHEAD. AND IF I WANT SOME OF THE GREATEST HARD ROCK EVER MADE I""LL LISTEN TO TOOL MINUS LATERLUS!!!"
2,Five years for this?!,"Opiate: Raw, jagged, fresh. Undertow: More refined, the band gets their legs. Aenima: Brilliant!!! Salival: Cool No Quarter re-make, KILLER DVD! Ho-hum other than that. Lateralus: WTF happened? I hear nothing new here. Lots of instrumental [stuff] and disjointed noise. The case design is innovative, but that is not always a good thing (anyone remember Pearl Jam's vs. case?). I'm sure it will grow on me with more listening, but this is a step backwards IMO. Five years to record an album breeds laziness and complacency.(sidenote) A Perfect Circle: Brilliant side project of Maynard IMO. Fab!!"
2,Dissapointing.,"Basically this sounds like Tool doing some rehashed versions of their previous songs with a boring squeaky clean production throughout which totally sucks the life out of this record.There is no way this album can stand up alongside ""Optiate"" ""Undertow"" or ""Aenima""."
3,NOT THAT GOOD AT ALL,"IM KIND OF DISSAPOINTED, TOOL USED TO BE A GOOD BAND, I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM WHEN THEY RECORDED THIS CD. I NEED TO LISTEN TO IT A FEW MORE TIMES TO GIVE A BETTER REVIEW. EAF"
2,2 big *Yawn* stars!,"Wow, what a tiresome 80 minutes that was. Tool have gone for an ambient approach on Lateralus. Stretch out about 3 minutes worth of music into about 9 or 10 minutes of tedium. None of these songs have any hooks nor do they have any mind blowing instrumentation. They are just................long...............and...bland. It's like they are just jamming in slow motion. Hit a tom there, strum a chord here, pluck a couple of bass notes. Maynard asks ""Have we reached 10 minutes yet?"" ...Adam Jones looks at his watch. Maynard sounds like he recorded the vocals in about 15 minutes in between touring with A Perfect Circle. Ok, maybe i'm being a bit harsh, Tool are still alot better than most mainstream music but this album was so uninspiring. ""Parabola"" is the only song that redeems this boring pretentious affair."
1,Help me out here!,My sister loves tool. but I'd never heard there music before. Then I heard Schism on mtv (I'm really not a fan of mtv but it was 3 in the morning) and I loved it! I just want to know if this is a good album and a good band. Can you all help me out? I really don't have a rating for the album since i only heard one song.
2,Decided I only hate it a little: a retraction.,"I suppose you can call this an addendum to my earlier review...Lateralis does grown on you to a point. It's apparantly one of those records that you really have to listen to again and again in order to appreciate. This doesn't excuse it from the monotonous and useless transitional tracks, or the fact that none of these songs are good enough to have been on either of the first three albums, but songs like Schism, The Grudge, Parabola and Lateralis make this album worth borrowing (still not worth buying yourself). Still a fan, but this album was definitely not worth waiting 5 years for. At least the pitiful and shamefully commercial Salival had all the videos on DVD as reason to purchase it. This record has no such redemption."
1,Over 1200 5 star reviews? Really?,"I don't get it... over 1200 5 Star reviews? I just don't get it! Would you say their review's were not that of the album itself or, more that of dedicated fan ferver? The only thing that really impressed me on this album was the packaging. Maybe that's what the over 1200 5 Stars were for . . . No?!"
1,BIG DISSAPOINTMENT,"I like tool's music, i'm not a huge fan but i have the albums and was genuinely looking forward to hearing the new album. I like a different sort of tool to most people - i like the tool songs like 'Crawl Away', 'Sweat', 'Intolerence' and 'Eulogy'. I don't like the songs like 'third eye' or 'disgustipated'. What i am basically trying to say that i am unnapreciative of ...their new album. It's boring and there a basically no proper songs on there there is now 'prison sex' or 'stinkfist' on this album. ....If you're new to tool, buy 'opiate' or 'undertow' instead...."
1,Justification for (...).,"They were once great, but, this is a joke. Where are the songs? This CD contains barely three or four songs! The rest are just random sound effects/noise and song ""fragments"", that's not ART, that's unfinished work! Tool has now joined the ranks of those talented bands who have turned their backs on the roots of their success. If you don't believe me, listen to Ticks&Leeches again. They're yelling at the Record Execs and Producers! This CD is just a vehicle for their angst against the record company. If Tool set out to make a junky, unfinished, unlistenable record... they've Succeeded! I say DON'T BUY it, and maybe next time they'll have to return to making real music (or they won't get a contract). We certainly don't need more releases like this."
1,Weak a huge dissappointment,"The only reason to buy this cd is for its booklet, it is the only good thing about Lateralus. As for the songs, they are all a letdown. The lyrical content drops from the previous albums greatly, and could have been written by anyone over the age of 7. As for the music, what was once innovative has been traded for repetitiveness. A prime example is schism, which is like 6 minutes of the same sorry guitar riff on repeat.Tool peaked at aenima."
1,Maybe I'm just not smart enough to enjoy this,"I don't see how so many people love this band. I've tried so hard to get into this band because people praise them but I just can't make it through the whole c.d. I'll admit they are very original, nobody I've heard really sounds like them , but I just can't get into them. The songs are very slow and boring and really drag on. Maybe you have to get high before you listen in to it to really understand."
5,My Favorite Album,"Individual summations of the songs on this album can't even begin to describe the magic of Lateralus. Saying that songs are ""arty"" or whatever is silly because this whole album is a piece of art. Not only is it art, but it's also an enlightening, intense, smart and most of all sacred album. The messages in the songs are mostly derived from the eastern Religions (Hinduism), and are just so well written and profound that it simply innihilates everything else.This is the only album I can think of that actually changed my life. The lyrics are just so meaningful and beautiful and the musicianship of the brilliant band members takes you to levels other bands haven't even touched. It's that kind of album where you can listen to over and over again and still find something new, and even though it might take a while to completely sink in, if you wait it out, the loving emrace will see you through."
5,"A softer, more composed version of Tool","I knew from the first time I heard Tool that they were going to be a band to invest money in. And man was I right! I'm not really into music if its not heavy or doesn't make me bang by head, BUT, this cd is VERY easy to get into, if you're patient. These songs are longer than older Tool songs, but I'm a patient guy. This cd is a MUST-BUY for almost anyone REMOTELY into rock music. Tool are themselves, though. Don't put them into any genre of music. Tool, keep it coming with some of the best and most beautiful music I've ever heard."
5,A Perfect Tool,"This album is so impressive that I find it hard to believe that this is only the third studio release (minus side projects and live material) from Tool. Instrumentally, this album is heavy, yet maintains the melodious nature that fans of Circle will enjoy. Good to see that intellectual music is still being created in the world of metal. I won't even go into a track by track description; this is the type of album you should just flat out buy and listen to without any preconceived expectations, and let Tool simply amaze you."
5,Classic Tool album,"i must say that this is definately tool's best album to date. the music is tight and intricate and splashed with vivid color and beautiful lyrics. most listeners won't get it the first time that they hear it. for most it just goes over their heads and is too much to take in- preffering shorter and more radio friendly (catchy) songs to enjoy. for anyone wanting to take a trip beyond what is considered ""music"", i highly suggest this masterpiece."
5,"Beautiful, dark, ethereal perfection.","Another perfectly flawless album from the greatest band ever (imho), it will take you places you never imagined going. Rip a bowl (optional) and listen to the album from beginning to end without skipping anything. This album is BEAUTIFUL. Utter genius."
3,inovative eh,"let me just say thisall the songs on this album give off the same mood. that depressed suburban nu metal kid vibe. ya they have some long 'epic' instrumetals that the mtv kids arent used to.. maybe thats why theyve been labled so inovative? im not saying the lyrics arent good [they are :O] i just wish all their songs didnt give off the same vibe.its the same fanbase as [korn] and [disturbed]. if you like bands like that, u may like this cd. but if you like bands like sabbath? and classic rock stuff i doubt u will be satisfied with this. they arent the 'new zeppelin' theyve been labled.i suggest u check out the white stripes! ^^"
4,lateraus,"I got this cd for christmas, and still i'm listening to it.Although it does get kinda boring and repetitive in some songsthat still doesent make it a bad album. first off you get intothe grudge whicth is a pretty cool song. then it fades intoeon blue apocalypse, imo should of been longer whicth would ofmade it more of an intersting song but hauntingly beautifullwith its finger picking. now on farther with the rest of the cdI personaly like the slow soft parabol fading into the hardparabola. now imo one of tools worst songs to dat is ticks&leeches, NOTE: maynerd, what were you thinking? the rest of thecd is for you to jugde."
5,Tool's last CD,"I know Tool for about 6 months now, and in that time I only listened to this album.And I must say I haven't heard such good rock in a long time!"
5,Incredible!,"As I listen to this album I can't keep myself from smiling. Unbelievable! The passion and purity of the music is so amazingly powerful words can't even begin to describe. Lateralus has its own sound distinct from Aenima and Undertow, with a more personal, poetic theme in the lyrics. The ideas are less abstract and more ""human"".After nearly 79 minutes of intense musical poetry and emotion, I will listen it through again. There's nothing artificial or manufactured on this album; each moment has a feeling, each song is completely authentic and original. For Tool fans, purchase of this is absolutely necessary.Tool has again birthed something which will last for many years, a work of art so very rarely attained in superficial modernity. Five stars is far too few."
5,Moving Music,"There are many words I could use to describe the Lateralus experience. Heavy would be one. Driven another. Hypnotic and gripping two more. Intense and... need I go on? Tool has done it again with another strong release. Many say that this is their best album. They sure set the bar high with Undertow and AEnima, so surpassing those two would be a tremendous accomplishment. It is hard for me to pick favorites out of the Tool albums I own, which are Undertow, AEnima, Lateralus, and 10,000 Days. I would say if you are a Metal or Progressive Rock fan you need to have some Tool in your collection. AEnima is where I started, and it is truly a great album. It sent the message home that Tool was a great band worth looking into. If you know you like their sound already, any of the four albums I mentioned would be safe choices, although I am leaning towards the former three. Enjoy your selection(s)."
4,Still the best,"It's funny to read reviews of Tool by people that don't like them or think they haven't progressed. They haven't progressed??? Get Opiate and compare it to Lateralus, there's a huge difference. I've listened to the ""other"" bands. Neurois?? Please, yelling in yours songs doesn't make you brillant. They do have some good drumming and musically are on the same level as Tool. But Maynard's voice is far superior. This CD is smooth, not as great as Aenima. See these guys live and you'll see why they have such a following."
3,It doesn't suck. Download first.,"I bought this when it first came out, listened to it like 10 times, and put it on the shelf. I don't think I've listened to it in over a year. It doesn't suck, and some of the songs are the best of Tool's career, but I'm just not excited about it. If you're a huge Tool fan you already own this, and if you're not you should start with Aenema."
4,It rocks !!!!!!!!!,"Lateralus is so nice... A cross between 70's King Crimson, Rush's Cygnus X-1 and 70's Black Sabbath, this album will stand for years... Why? Cause the sound is excellent, Bottrill's production is top notch and the songs are so progressive... Highlights: The Grudge,Parabola and Thicks and Leeches... Dany Carey is a hell of a drummer who play odd rythms like you and me are writings our names... Adam Jones' guitar sound is so heavy and crystal clear... I my opinion, the Perfect Circle influence is not a bad thing cause there is much more musical details on this record than on Aenema... I like the soft parts of Lateralus as much as the heavy parts... The band did a lot of research for cool sounds... Try listening this CD with Headphones, it's a must!!!"
3,decent follow up,"Good record, just doesn't compare to Aenima. I recently rated this record in an ecstatic way and i was really wrong about giving it 5 stars and it is nowhere near as good as the previous record. Still good though and worth purchasing if you are a fan."
4,BEST IN SHOW,"While maintaining their overt 20's something sensabilities, Keenan and Co. are actually producing real rock. Haunting, surreal, and full of surprises, Tool stands nearly alone as a sunspot in the otherwise blightfully bleak soundscore of 21st cen. rock. The plasticine liner presentation is a bit atavistic, but few of the fans will even know what I'm talking about. I used to have one of those skeleton books too! I look so forward to seeing them live! Cool."
3,"Hey, it IS Tool ? but wheres the trippy soundscapes?","I like this album because it combines UNDERTOW and AENEMA to a degree but then it expands on that idea. Some of the dynamics seem odd even for Tool. I really dug Opiate when i was 13, got Undertow and fell in love with that and Aenema, well that album is their masterpiece. But I feel somewhat let down by this CD, I expected more from the premier band in rock n roll. Contrary to what the band themselves will tell you, it seems they've almost rested on their laurels and just decided to throw together some songs that they had sitting around. Anyone else get this feeling? now dont get me wrong I love Tool and all their previous works made me see them live 5 times in my lifetime but I get the feeling that this album is missing something...."
4,Amazing,"(I would really give this 4.5 stars, but ...doesn't allow half stars, so oh well) I've been waiting for this CD for so long, but it was worth the wait. Lateralus is such a step from nima. Everything sounds absolutly huge. Monstrous guitars, amazing double bass, and complex basslines often give way to quiet, psychedelic interludes. Adding to the music, the CDs packaging is very interesting."
5,Tool delivers,"I have been a devoted Tool fan ever since I first bought Aenima when it was released in 10/96. From there I discovered Opiate and Undertow and became, on my music-listening level, totally consumed by these guys. I waited patiently for 4 1/2 years for Lateralus to be released. Tool is a band who refuse to conform. They prove this in Lateralus. It is a work of art. Like each of their albums before, this one is different from the last, by taking different twists and turns that they have never done before. The first single released to radio, ""Schism"", is almost 7 minutes long, and they leave nothing out. Tool is famous for keeping their sound interesting, not annoying, in any song, all the way to the end. Track 11, ""Reflection"" is 11 minutes of mesmerizing drumming and middle-eastern influences, which leads into track 12, ""Triad"" which is an instrumental that simply put, kicks butt. For those like myself who are open-minded devoted Tool fans, you will not be disappointed."
2,Tool fails to impress me...,"What can I say? Lateralus simply bores me to death. I used to be a fan of Tool's. I loved AEnima, so i was pretty excited to hear that the band was releasing a new cd. Schism was a decent song upon first listen, and i was expecting better with the rest of the songs. I listened to the album a few times, I WANTED to like it. But alas, i didnt. It's such a shame. The only reason I gave this album two stars is because i like Parabola. Too bad Tool has become a victim of overhype."
4,nothing new,"ok, i've listened to two songs and already it sounds just like nima. that's ok. i like nima.what i want to know is...how can the art work matter? is this empty-v talking here? thinking artwork will make music better is like thinking robert smith's hair and lipstick somehow had anything at all to do with the cure's music all these years.ahhh...poor children, products of too much empty-v watching. try to just *listen* to the music. don't *look* at it.anyway, this album is a bit more dreamy than nima and the mix seems kinda...weird. mjk's voice isn't as prominent. mantra is great, seeing as i'm a big fan of lustmord/köner/robert rich type music as well."
3,Worst Tool Album but still good...,"I bought Lateralus at the midnight sale when it first came out...this is a very good album but its missing something that every other tool album has...Something about the sound is off.M Missing some energy or something I like it for what it is, and if it was any other band it would get 5 stars. But this is Tool, and this album doesnt measure up to their other work."
3,"Huge fans will like this, i dont.","I gave this album 3 stars for the redeeming moments (""The Grudge"" and ""Parabola""). This album seems to be stuck back at where Tool's last album was, only they expanded on the boring non musical tracks. I laugh when Tool fans tell me they dont forward through Disposition because I know they do. If you're a big Tool fan you may like this. But if you want better songwriting and better lyrics i suggest the previous release Aenima."
3,Not Bad,"This is the first Tool disc I've heard and bought it because many reviewers proclaim this to be a progressive masterpiece. This is a good disc but far from a masterpiece or progressive, it is more in the nu-metal style.Pros: The drummer grounds the band with very intriguing syncopated beats that groove well with the bass player. The guitarist plays only what is needed, the singer is decent and the engineering is good. Song highlights: ""The Grudge"", ""Parabola"", ""Ticks & Leeches"" and the title track.Cons: There is too much noodling and many of the songs are quite monotonous, for example, ""Reflection"" clocks in at 11:07 with nothing more than a trance-like repetitive groove/bass line played over and over... granted the dynamics increase but the tune never develops. The disc at 78:50 is way too long and could have been trimmed down to 50 minutes easily. By writing a less than four-star review of this disc I'm sure to receive many ""not helpful"" votes."
2,bravo,"This is the first album of it's type I have ever purchased. It's an amazing album. I'm 47 years old and never thought I'd like something like this. The album is most enjoyable as a whole. It looses something listening to individual tracks.Something about this album touches the dark side of my soul and it feels good. It's a perfect mixture of anger, testosterone, melody and power; and it's put together well. The melodies are carefully constructed and there is just enough harmony to add a gentleness to the composition. Just like The Verve and Urban Hymes, I will enjoy listening to earlier stuff."
5,Still just as good.,"4 years after its release, and 4 years of playtime in my CD player and I still only have one word to describe every single track on this album.Awefrickenperfectsome.Yeah... that's not a word... but it's THAT good."
3,takes some getting used to,"When I first got this CD, i didn't particularly like it, as I had been spoiled by AEnima and undertow. After having had about a year to listen to it, i've changed my tune. The songs have very complex structures and are very catchy. Maynard's lyrical genius once again shines thru as he writes some of the most complex poetry i've heard. Very abstract and calculated."
2,What Happened!?!?,I guess I expected too much after listening to Undertow and Aenima. I found this cd to be very bland and too repititive. It sounded to me as if they sampled parts of songs from their previous recordings and stretched them out for 8 minutes. A little to ambient for me. I hope they get back to kickin out jams like Intolerance and Stinkfist on their next effort.
4,great but...,lost a star for to much weird noises! most tracks start with nonsense noise that you have to skip through to get to the actual song. the actual songs though are fantastic! this is not entirely new for tool however it is over the top on this album. aenima at least has some of the weird noises as separate tracks so it's easier to skip them.
2,A great album on a not-so-great-medium.,"Lateralus is my favorite rock/metal album of all-time. I thought it was about time to get a vinyl version. However, I was extremely disappointed with the sound of this album in picture-disc format. There is an extreme amount of surface noise on the record which includes a constant background hiss and way too many pops and clicks for a new record. In addition, the more complex passages of the album (heavier, louder and layered) sound distorted.It was only after I listened to the record that I really started to research picture discs. In general they are thought to be sub-par sounding and only meant for display. I would agree with this assessment.Do yourself a favor and go with traditional vinyl whenever possible."
5,I love this album,"I usually listen to music that makes me feel good. I also listen to music that describes my personality. But Tool (which is my #1 favorite band in the world) music describes my inner thoughts, feelings, and personality..I think it's probably why i can get enough of tool.I've first heard of Tool through... the Parabola video that they showed on MTV's All things that Rock in the summer of 2002, and i have never left the since. But.., this CD is truely a masterpiece and i would advise anyone to get this album to listen to be ""enlighten"" by some ""Genius Album""...I love this CD........Great music........Every song is my favorite off this album, but My favorite track may have to be.""Lateralus""....It's truly the inner core of this album....EVERY ROCK FAN SHOULD GET THIS ALBUM BECAUSE......IT'S JUST ......PERFECT....(My opinion)"
5,I Cant Get Enough...,"it doesn't matter how many times I play this CD, I can't seem to leave it alone for more than a week. I enjoy all types of music so the supposed change that took place in TOOL has not affected me in the least. It seems softer than previous works but fairly unnoticable when really taking the music in. It's definitely a CD that takes a complete listening to, otherwise songs and idea's are taken out of context and it gets ruined. If you really like music that is layered (like Pink Floyd) this will not let you down."
5,Understand the Musicality,"If you are anything of a musician, you will love this CD. It has some of Tool's best instrumentals. From the changing time signitures of The Patient and Lateralis, to the beautiful bass/guitar lines of Schism, to the complexity of the drumming in Ticks and Leeches. You can't leave out Maynard's strangely perfect voice out of the equation either. Without him, the band would not be the same. While other's may say Aenima or Undertow are Tool's best work, I can see that only as being the fact that they have more catchy metal songs on those. Lateralus is a genious album, and I highly recommened it, as I found it superb."
5,"Tool's ""Best Yet""","Tool are talented musicians, confident in what they do. The new album couldn't really be anything other than what it is, because Tool is Tool and the music that is Tool seems to emanate autonomously from the band members. It is natural, this album, and can be described no other way. I believe Lateralus is head and shoulders above Aenima, but of course that's just me. Progression is natural when a band is artistically unpretentious...Lateralus is alive as opposed to stagnant and reified. Lateralus is becoming as opposed to become. Also, the liner notes in my copy smell GREAT."
5,Don't listen to the bad comments!!!!!,"People are gonna say,""That's not like the old Tool!"" No it isn't, but it's still as musically great as any other Tool release. Best for die-hard Tool fans, and best for new-comers to the Tool scene. Fans of Staind and the like will be pleased with this release. I got this album as soon as i could. The packaging is very strange, no lyrics or liner notes, just pictures of the human anatomy on that clear plastic sheet stuff. I said it once and I'll say it again, BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!"
4,Amazing Yet Dull,"Finally Tool's new album arrived, and as kick as i got i put it on and listened to it. It left me with a sense of dissapointment and disbelief. It is very similar to ""Aenima"", very similar guitar sound and song process. I fell that Tool have felt the need to try and write an epic album which will live on forever, and concentrated on length not substance. A couple of songs htey seem like that they are trying to just prolong the end and get the songs past the 6 or 7 minute barrier, that the album losses something from this. ""Schism"", should not have been the first single from this album as it is probaly one of the worse songs on the album. I think the thing which keeps ""Aenima"" ahead of ""Lateralus"" is that ""Lateralus"" doesn't have that killer song, where other great albums do have this. This album stands out ahead of all the rap/metal...around nowadays, but i must say that i was a little dissapointed."
4,"moments of joy and moments of bordom, like always with Tool",my title should say it all. Tool love the gimics and they they ever use them to their full extent. this is an entertaining cd just nothing to write home about. personally i enjoy a perfect circle much much better.
4,Tool Refocuses,"It seems that Maynard's time away from Tool to do 'A Perfect Circle' has done the group some good. This release finds them focused and pouring out some of the best music of their career. It's a great mix of the light/heavy style they have brought back into vogue, without too many of the insane diversions that earlier albums took. There are a lot of interesting sounds in here that form new musical textures for them to play off of. They have wisely chosen to keep pushing the edge as they go forward and not just rest on their laurels, which is always to be commended. Go buy it!"
3,I was honestly not too impressed,"I really love Tool- they have a great sound and they are excellent musicians. I read the online critiques of Lateralus and judging by the rave reviews, I figured it was worth investing in buying it online myself. But really, I was not impressed. The songs have little to distinguish themselves from one another, and the CD as a whole lacks the energy and direction that Tool can usually deliver. If someone said ""I absoutely ADORE track 5, I would have to say ""which one is that?"" because really, they all sound pretty much alike to me.On the plus side, the CD moves very easily from one track to another, giving it a very unified and complete feel for playing from beginning to end, and you won't be forwarding past certain songs if you like the album as a whole.Overall, great band, so-so CD. 3 stars."
2,Progressively worse,"A much better band before they could afford 10,000 hours of studio time. Overproduced, meandering and lacking that hair-raising Tool crunch of old. Hooks are sparse, crescendos abandoned, more and more like Yes every album. MJK isn't into it anymore, and it shows; there's enough dull introspection on this one to fill 2 Perfect Circle records. Take me back to Undertow for the love of god. Yeah great cover."
5,Tool: a positive force that keeps growing,"I really enjoy listening to this album. Tool are adept at creating emotional, powerful, and challenging music that focuses on a central theme without being repetitive.Maynard's lyrics on Lateralus are openly confessional and direct, and therefore beautiful. His willingness to share himself through his lyrics puts him in a vulnerable position, and he deserves respect for such selflessness.""Reflection"" is a great example of Maynard's ability to communicate something many would be unwilling to share so freely.Close examination of the album reveals a focus on positive messages; tolerance, communication, and selflessness are encouraged throughout.Tool and especially this latest offering are a rare gem in today's musical scene. They demonstrate that anger and strentgh are not to be confused with hate, and also that thinking for one's self and being a positive force in a turbulent world is what is really important."
5,3rd quarter,"the album gets better and better after many listens. if you dont like this album or tool, that is fine. but if you listen to collective soul, nickelback, linkin park, well that speaks volumes in itself. lets be realistic here for a moment if we can. there is not another band out there as thought out, original, deep, dark, mysterious, brilliant as tool. show me 4 band members who have as good of chemistry as these guys, you cant do it. those who judge negative, have you seen them live? probably not is my guess. and dont classify ""tool fans"" into some big dumb category, for tool itself cannot be categorized. unfortunately, most people just dont have the attention span, its a serious issue. think it over. if you have time. peace."
5,start with one track,"how many people actually love anything they hear at first? i bought the album and listened to it a few times. to be honest, it took me an effort to get into...just like other tool stuff. over the next few weeks i would focus on one song and seek to understand it. i realized what a great album this was when i delved into the track lateralus. the verse is in a captivating 9/8, 8/8, 7/8 pattern that amazed me. the next part that blew me away was the build-up. listen to the explosive change. it is just one of those...musical moments. i'm proud of an album with an 8 minute avg. track time. seek to understand....."
3,All I have to say is...,"If the purpose of this CD was to put me to sleep, it has fully succeeded. Much of the singing is monotone. Overall the CD is mellow, and cleaner sounding than Opiate, Undertow, and Aenima. Anyway, I personally don't like music that puts me to sleep (3 stars), but I guess that's just me (from the reviews so far)."
3,Cute (3 & 1/2),"This is WAY too long and has its boring stretches, but it's surprisingly quite enjoyable. The graphic design is interesting, although it's just as ""no fun"" as always. It's interesting that the singles from this record, while melodic and interesting OUT of context, turn out to be so weak as pieces of the whole.The lyrics are still relatively meaningless and the album still succumbs to its own indulgence more often than not, hence the rating. This is Tool's best album, I'd say, which makes it all the more interesting that all the Tool fans I know seem to despise it!"
2,Not what I wanted,"I think AEnima is a really terrific album, five stars all the way, and I really like the first Perfect Circle CD, but this disc I just did not like. I know that's not a popular position, but this disc just lacks the great wicked hooks and action of earlier Tool/APC stuff. I like my rock albums to, you know, actually ROCK. And this album simply does not.It's like Tool started to read and buy into their press clippings; it's contemplative, self-indulgent art rock, almost totally edgeless. Because I liked AEnima so much, my expectations were high and this disc just completely disappointed me."
2,Not their best.,"This is Tool just losing soul or melody in their music.""Aenima"" is light years ahead of this."
5,Tool's best,"I had been looking forward to this album sense January and I wasn't dissapointed at all. This is truly Tool's best album. From the moment you hear the The Grudge tell Faaip De Oaid is over your sucked into this CD. Most bands couldnt do an intresting 9 minute song but Tool can easly pull it off. After this came out alot of Tool fans where complaning about how Tool had lost there touch and blah blah blah "" it's not like Aenima.."".....Aenima came out almost 6 years ago, I knew it was going to sound diffrent but i knew Tool would come through. Tool isnt some angry metal band. They produce Great art. Tool is the Pink Floyd of our time."
3,It's not a -bad- album.,"Most Tool fans won't like what I have to say here. This is an album with a much more accomplished sound than previous works. The vocals have improved, and to some extent been influenced by Maynard's first outing with A Perfect Circle. I just didn't care for the pretentiousness. Tool started out, with a silly, angry sort of album with Opiate. Undertow, was the same sound, but dealt with more personal matters for Maynard. Aenima, was just wierd as hell. It didn't really make any sense, but it sounded cool. The deal with Lateralus, is the entire thing is just so pretentious and overproduced... I can't stand listening to metal like this. Even their most recent ""10,000 Days"" actually makes sense to me. It doesn't seem as overdone. Lateralus was most people's favorite tool album, it just didn't do it for me the same."
5,"Not an album, an experience","This album is not really an album, it is more of an experience. The guitar riffs are great (as with all Tool albums) and the vocals are equally good. However, what allows Lateralus to transcend most other rock albums is the feeling throughout. The album all fits together with an interesting New Age theme. Tool manipulates the emotions with their music, and this is what makes it so amazing. Some of there songs exude peace, like The Patient, while others stir up terror. Let me warn you: the album ends with a track called ""Faaip De Oiad"". If you buy this album, do not listen to this track alone at night because it will scare the crap out of you. It goes to show how powerful the music is. If you are seeking a great album to make you think or to meditate to, then Lateralus is a great choice."
4,NOT THE BEST TOOL ALBUM OUT THERE,"There are better albums by tool than this like undertow or aenima. This cd isn't bad at all, it just isn't really the tool I know and love. ""The grudge"" is my favorite song on here. The cd is still good but don't get it unless your a realy hardcore tool fan."
5,Completely awesome,"This was the best album of 2001. That is pretty clear.This is also Tool's best album. That is also pretty clear.Actually I think this is the best album ever, but you mightdisagree on this point.For me, the album is basically the interplay between Adam'sguitar and Justin's bass. The drumming is very complicated andspectacular. The vocals are somewhat subdued but they arealso great.The most inventive song I think is Schism, for its weird rhythm.The prettiest song is the Patient. There is a great guitarsolo in Parabola. The pinnacle of the album is the end of thevery long Reflection, whose lyrics have a deep meaning.Some advice: Go get yourself a guitar or bass, tune the E stringdown to D (except for Parabola, where you need a low B), get anappropriate-sized pick, et bonne chance!"
4,Great and challenging record but...,"Of course it's the best thing to come out of the mainstream recording industry since AEnima but: where's the rage? As much as I enjoy it (I've listened to it no fewer than 25 times), I do miss the anger at ""the man"" and the intelligent-rage that characterizes all of Tool's other records. Even ""Ticks"" seems to come up short in the rightous anger department, compared to, say, ""The Bottom.""Maynard seems to be at peace with himself and falls into flights of Whitmanesque fancy, dealing with the sacred nature of the profane, etc., and that's good for him personally. I guess that's a product of becoming incredibly wealthy. But I still like to hear some F-Us being screamed. I want to hear the hypocrisy of religion exposed and expounded on. I look to Tool (MJK) to sing about and convey through sound the anger and healthy cynicism that I feel about America in this modern age.Still, I'd say you'll find no other record half as good until Tool releases their next one."
5,Spiritual Rock,"I don't like putting labels on things but when the time comes to describe this record to someone unfamiliar with the music of Tool I say ""spiritual rock."" As a student of philosophy I can't say enough about the poetic, yet explicit descriptions of the human struggle laid out over hyptnotic riffs and primal drumming. To listen to this cd without paying attention to the lyrics though is bordering on self imposed intellectual malnutrition, it cannot be appreciated fully without taking the time to work throught the dramatic poems to find the deeper meaning. I hope that one person can read this, buy the cd, listen to it and identify with the songs about love, patience and awareness. If you can do that you will realize why this album has been anticipated by so many people for so long."
4,Pretty good,"Lateralus is great and all, but only two or three songs really hook you and make you want to listen over and over. I think its really one of those albums you have to listen to over and over to appreciate it. Don't get me wrong - MJK has come a long way since Aenima, his singing has greatly improved, but it could have used some more memorable tunes. Still, a great CD. Not as good as Aenima though. Schism, Ticks & Leeches and Lateralis are must-listens."
1,Grimmace and Wince,"Bloated bombastic flatulent nonsense for all the tough-guy mascarad drama-queens of the neo fad age. The musical equivalent of an airport newsagency pulp fiction novel. My life and awarenesses are none the better for this pointless exercise in stadium melodrama. For crissakes, it's just pop music, a trival inconsequential side annexe of the global corporate entertainment industry - hardly Revelations. Why blow it out of all proportion? Tool fans must lead sheltered shallow miserable lives. Wake up, team, and smell the roses. Get out of your sad dog boxes and go camping or fishing or something. Make a fresh fruit salad or an exotic coconut cocktail - do ANYTHING except wallow in this morose pap."
2,Come on...they're not that good.,"This band just came to my town about 6 months ago, and everybody here likes them now, and it's making me sick. Let's not forget the fact that MTV and all the ""rock"" radio stations ran Schism into the ground. They really don't sound as original as most people think. I mean, sure they have that ""freaky"" sound, but Marilyn Manson has that sound too, and he is so horrible I'm afraid I would have to pick 3 Doors Down over them. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because of Danny Carey. He is one of the better drummers I've heard recently. But, I would consider buying Mudvayne or System of a Down (one of the greatest bands ever) over Tool."
1,"A true Tool fan, a true person could not give any thing less","I've noticed the constant ""its not like thier other album which spoke to me"" if you'd learned any thing from Tool it would be to open you ""Third Eye"" and see some thing new and different, with its own, not the one before, art work.Tool is not some thing you just get into because it sounds good, I like that guitar part and I like that drums part.""Tool is what you soak into your brain which opens it to what you don't see and don't want to, but its there""Maybe I didn't give it a 5 put thats because I'm being different as is this CD which very well is ignored, just looked at with ""Undertow"" and ""Aenima"" glasses that you put on that Tool never created.""Tool is some thing that you can listen to, and not even understand the words to but you get a feel, you know its art and beyhond"""
1,Your a tool if you like tool!,"This is by far ? The most boring bullsh*t i've ever heard in my entire life, period! I wonder what kids be thinking when they weare tool t shirts to metal concerts in the first place ?! Korn t shirts,mudvayne,tool,linkin park...Don't wear that to a real metal concert!!Anyways, i gave this retards known by tool a listing and did i like it ? No! It sucked so do not bother and for good music don't look for tool or any nu-metal cd in that case."
2,Tool is the greatest band ever!,"OMG, Tool is so intelligent with their 20 minute songs and subtle lyrics and crazy time signatures I could cry! And since I like Tool that must make me really smart too! OMG, I'm going to run around all day wearing Tool shirts and give off smart vibes. People who like songs that last less than an hour can stay away!!!"
2,Brilliant Heck NO?,"This is Tool's latest album. It is perhaps one of the most unique albums ever made, but that does not make them so great. Tool is one of the worst Progressive Metal bands to walk on the face of the earth. Heck, they are not even Progressive Metal, more like Pseudo-Progressive Metal. The guitarwork in this album is terrible and the drumming is way too unpaced and random. Maynard's vocals are terrible and hardly shows much talent. My point is that Tool is one-terrible Metal version of Pink Floyd. Don't buy this album. Instead pick up one of these cds: Dream Theater- Scenes From A Memory Pain Of Salvation- Remedy Lane or The classic Pink Floyd- The Wall. Tool is a bad waste of time and definitely a waste of talent."
1,Woah.,"Woah. Tool. Dude. This ""C-D"" is a metal band trying to be intelligent. It's an interesting combination. Kinda like Spinal Tap trying to be college professors. But it works, in a solar-powered flashlight kind of way."
5,BEST TooL CD EVER!!!,This CD happends to be my number one all time favorite CD by Tool or any other band out there. Maynard knows how to sing. His voice is scary yet soothing and teh music itself is heavy yet relaxing. They're are one of only a few bands that could pull off a son gin 5/6 time.(Schism) Parabola is the best song on this CD. Buy. Listen. LOVE IT!!
3,not worth 5 years at all,"If they had been constantly working towards writing a great record over those 5 years maybe this album would deserve 4-5 stars, but I really think they didn't put a whole lot of effort into it this time around. It's either that or they just ran out of ideas after the last one which truly was a masterpiece. Still worth checking out, but not their best."
2,"Great Album, quality problems","I have heard this album many times. I have to say, the vinyl release sounds incredible, its mixed and mastered very well and the music is very 'present' with great soundstaging. There is one major issue though..My 2nd disc is defective. It sounds like it is made out of dust, even after mutlitple thorough cleanings. I have tried listening to that disc twice now and it sounds like it is made of dust and held together by static cling...highly disappointing for a $43 album to have so much white noise its not listenable. I promise this isnt my gear...other 'new' vinyl plays and sounds fine with only very occasional and minor white noise.I'm not entirely sure how to proceed. The 2nd disc sounds absolutely terrible! I hate feeling like I've wasted money."
5,tool rules,Yes we all know schism is a great song but as an abum lateralus delivers a pretty powerful message. You will bang your head one song then ponder your existance the next. Great for everyone even if its not your usual cup of tea. Great buy!
5,latest from tool (not exactly new but im alittle late),ok here we have the latest from the greatest badn ever maynard has the same great voice danny carrey is still pounding those war drums and yes adam jones and jason chancellor are still bringing the whole experience together. this is one of the best from a great band pick it up if you like to jam out
4,whoa maynard,"This CD is packaged beautifully, well All Tool Cd's are unique, but this one takes the cake. Much like Jack Osbourne, my husband listens to this CD non stop"
5,Amazing.,"These guys just don't quit. Consistency, dignity, and superb musicianship coat this disc like syrup. Equal to and different from their previous outings and still rocks the house like a motherf!*ker. The best band and one of the best CDs ever, period."
5,"tool is back.. older, wearier, wiser","like one of the many fans of this band.. i have been waiting in anticipation for this cd, and.. today i bought it.. and was just silenced. this isn't what i'd expected.. this isn't what i'd hoped for.. but.. this is tool.. and it is good.the songs are wrapped in a more melodic density.. heavy.. and..intricate.. i've listened to it at least 6 times already today.. and each time i find myself captivated by a different track.it's not undertow.. it's not aenema.. it's not what you think.. if you like tool buy this cd and make up your own mind. this cd returns to us, tool, as a living, breathing BAND.. and not just a sound from the past."
5,Lateralus is just the beginning,"Not only is this album Tool's best and most complex album, but it is by far the best album i have ever owned. I have Tool's Aenima and Undertow CDs and they are five stars too, but if i could Lateralus would get 10 stars. Plus Tool is coming out with a new CD sometime this spring. For more information go to tool's ""nearly official site"" (go to google and type in ""tool"", you will see it)Oh and the song Lateralus is the best song i have ever heard."
4,a very interesting album,"i was never a big tool fan.this is the first tool record i bought.it took some time to grow on me and i find it very amusing.the way maynard uses his vocals and the guitar is really heavy with the crazy bass drums in the background.i bought it because i was looking for a good meatal cd since i'm a metal fan.i picked this up because i like the radio hit ""Schism"" and i heard good things about it.pick this record up next time your checking out the metal section.it's good for your money.good songs are ""Parobola"",""Ticks and Leeches"",""The Grudge"",""Lateralus"",and of coarse ""Schism""."
3,Didn't I just listen to this song?,"I have been a tool fan for a while now and their first CD's are great, but this one just doesn't live up to their standards. ""Schism"" and ""Parabola"" are the best songs on the CD, but all of the songs on this album sound alike. It just doesn't compare with their other CD's and maybe they should find some new sounds for their next album. Tool is still a good band and anything they do will sell good."
5,They did it AGAIN!!!,Words definitely can not describe this cd. They are by far the best rock band or band for that matter ever. They go where no other band will dare to go. They like their music different and so do I. I'm tired of one band sounding just like the last one. TOOL is definitely genuine with every song they make. It's never been done before...unless you want to talk of Pink Floyd.
5,kick the wannabe's down a notch,"So many bands (too many to list) used the past 5 years to try to imitate Tool's sound. With this latest release Tool proves again that the 'formula' just isnt that easy to recreate. Another complex, dark and engaging recording from the masters and originators of the genre. Too bad Im at work and have to use the headphones."
5,An Incredible Cd!!,"This is my first cd by Tool that I had bought. I bought it after I heard Schism on the radio. At that point, i wasn't completely impressed, but I thought that it was cool enough. I took it home and listened to it a couple times. I Was Completely Blown Away!!!! The songs are all, in a way, beautiful, yet at the same time they are full of anger and despairity. I kinda thought that the band had spent more time on this cd than on their previous ones, even though I like them a lot. My favorite songs are ""The Grudge"", ""Schism"", and ""Ticks & Leeches"". I greatly recommend this cd to anyone who likes music in particular. They would enjoy it just as much as a hard rock lover, like me, would."
4,Maynard does it again.,"With albums like Aenima and Undertow, I didn't think tool was going to be able to make it back. But to my suprise Maynard and the boys are back and have something to say. The guitar playing seems to have become a more powerful and intense part of the song. Maynard's voice and lyrics though in my opinion still make the whole song. All I can say is it's worth the buy if you liked any of the past albums you'll love Lateralus."
5,art rock?,"Well some say it isnt the same as the old tool, but who wants to dwell in the past? This cd goes through signifigant emotional changes from double bassed anger to loving guitar riffs to hypnotizing words. This may be the beginning of a new era of music with this cd, because their talent is overwhelmingly addicting. They took they're time putting this together, cause you find yourself lost in the music when you close your eyes. If you are looking for something new and intrigueing, Pick up the laterus cd, and I promise you'll find yourself bobbin your head"
4,"Really good, but it's not that amazing","Since I never had Tool's older albums, I'm writing on neutral lines. The first 10 songs are all great and give them a very rich and diverse sound. Songs like The Patient, The Grudge, Parabol+(a), Schism, Ticks and Leeches, and Lateralis are definite standouts and some are long pieces that most bands could never produce. But tracks 11-13 are throw-away tracks. 11 goes on forever with the same boring arabic beat with a small element being added every minute. 12 is just too chaotic, and it has no substance. 13 makes does not fit in at all and could be recorded by a 3 year old. Some Tool fans will say the cliched ""this guy can't comprehend Tool."" To those I say SOME Tool fans are blindly obssesed and if Tool recorded their music through a plunger it would be an epic. This CD should be in anyones collection for the first ten songs alone. But it is by no means perfect because of the sloppiness of the last 3 songs."
3,Could've Been Better Though I'm Not Sure How,"I picked this album up the day it came out, and i was really somewhat disappointed though i wanted to like it. I think Aenima was edited better, and that a lot of the material included in Lateralus is excess. I didn't have the patience to listen to the entire album in one sitting. It seemed too much like a continuation of Aenima, yet at the same time it felt like Tool had regressed. This new album isn't whole. It seems like they wanted to say more, but crammed what they did have onto a single disk, resulting in a prelude of sorts."
4,Happy,"I'm pretty happy with Lateralus. The CD was in perfect condition, but the case and artwork was used at best."
5,"A different breed of ""progressive.""","If you say ""progressive rock"" these days, almost everyone thinks of Dream Theater. Yeah, I like them, but their emphasis seems to be more on instrumental prowess than creating moods. Tool is more the latter kind of band, sort of like a modern-day Pink Floyd.Lateralus is a great record to space out to, but I did have to listen to it a few times to really get the most from it. There are entire tracks on this CD that I can't hear in my car! It's best to sit down in your home and put it on your stereo, or even listen to it with headphones. This disc displays a lot more emotional depth than previous Tool albums, and Danny Carey's percussion is amazing throughout.There are a few spots where they seem to be doing weird stuff just for the sake of doing weird stuff (""Faaip de Oiad,"" for instance), but overall this is Tool's best work to date. My favorite tracks, pretty much in order: ""Reflection,"" ""Lateralis,"" ""Schism,"" ""The Grudge."""
1,oh dear,"19 minute songs? horrible vocalism about being patient and human dna? i think not. want real music, go to radioa@aol now go to pop their ya go! theirs yer music or go buy all the good charlotte cds, listen to limp bizkit's break stuff that song has inspired me to play the turn tables"
5,Unbelievable,"This record is the most beautiful, creative, and entertaining pieces of art ever made. If you love music, this is the album to buy. Words cannot describe this. Totally different from any other sound around, this cd will draw you in. I predict this will win album of the year in several venues. Please go out and buy it."
2,Tool fans beware!,"This is not a Tool album. It should have been made under the name of A Perfect Circle. Technically, this is a very good album. The sound is high quality, and the musical ability of the band is top notch. However, it isn't a Tool album. The songs are much too peaceful for Tool, and almost all the songs lack the haunting darkness of previous albums. ""Schism"", the first radio hit, is about the only song that is reminiscent of previous songs. A good Perfect Circle album, but a poor effort by Tool."
2,What is the hype on this extremely BLAND album???,"There is all this hype about how good this album is, this CD is terrible. I have listened to the album a good 20 times or so, and I just cant bear to play it any more. There are some tracks on the album that you would wonder why they are even on the disc! The Grudge and Schism may be the only 2 highlights of the disc, and the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because the album cover has some of the coolest artwork ive seen in awhile on it. Otherwise, the disc itself is mindless, repetitive drivel."
3,i love tool but...,"this album really lacks the usual puch that tool delivers.Its not that im not open to new sound but its just that tool watered down their sound and made it last longer. The album didnt even rock out till parabola and it wasnt even that great..i gave this album a full on chance, i really did, but it just didnt do it for me...."
1,NOT PROGRESSIVE,I GUESS PEOPLE ARE REALLY DESPERATE FOR MUSIC WITH MEANING...THIS AINT IT...NOT PROGRESSIVE AS EVERYONE TAUTS THEM TO BE...RATHER BORING MELODIC-LESS NOODLING...MONOTONE DREAM THEATER... SCREACHY SCRATCHY THROATY HOARSE CHLORASEPTIC NEEDING VOICE...MOST GOD AWFUL VOICE ... INSTRUMENTATION THAT MEANDERS...PROG METAL WANNABES...METAL THIS AINT...MUSIC THIS AINT...SOURED ME FOR WEEKS....RUN AWAY!!!!
1,Better than Aenima!!!!,I have listed to this album...it is the achievement I'm proud of...this album is full of music straight from HELL!!!
3,Most Tool fans least favorite album,"There is a reason most Tool fans cite this as their least favorite album...Its a very good album, but compared to other Tool it just isnt as good... Aenima, Undertow, and even 10,000 days are far better. If youre just getting into Tool, dont start here. Start with Aenima..."
5,Lateralus rocks,"This is the best album of the year and a truely great addition to hard rock. Although, slow at times, great songs like The Grudge, Schism, and one of my all time favorite songs Parabola really make this an excellent record. I would advise any fan of hard rock to purchase this album."
5,What about the transition tracks?,"I wasn't going to write a review; heck, there are hundreds already. But the people saying it doesn't live up to nima in part because Eon Blue, Mantra, and Faaip De Oiad aren't real tracks, meaning that there are only ten ""real songs"" on the disc are having some proplems with basic math--and they're annoying me to no end. Have they listened to nima lately? That album has 6 non-musical tracks! (i.e. Useful Idiot, Harry Manback, Intermission, Satan--instruments and vocals, yes, but like Faaip--Cesaro, and (-)) Meaning only nine ""real songs""!That all said, I think nima has a number of better songs, but Lateralus is a better compleate album.Bah humbug! Buy it now!"
5,These people are real!,"Unlike Korn,Limp Bizkit,Coal Chamber,Spineshake,and Slipknot who's albums are very poorly written Tool is the real deal.If you like Radiohead or Depeche Mode you will most likely love Tool.At first it is about a minute of music that makes you feel confused and makes you wonder what the song is going to be like then when the words come in you are just blown away.Some of my favorites are ""Schism"",""Lateralis"",and ""Reflection"". Tool's ""Lateralus"" is the album of the year and i highly recomend this CD to you."
3,Had to change my rating,"Salival was an indicator that they didnt care much anymore. I prefer a perfect circle, this album is stuck somewhere between undertow and a perfect circle, but it still cant touch Aenima, its good. But After listening a couple of times I realize that its not their best. Not that it has to be. Just that it could have been better, it sounds like a b side compliation. Awesome b sides, but still, something is missing."
2,Get *Undertow.*,"Unnecessary repeat of the Aenima and Undertow sound, but without the hooks. Very mediocre effort.*Undertow* is a great cd."
3,Does this Album Ever End?,"ok so the album begins. You're expecting alot. But YOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE NOT MET. Honestly, this album drags on and drags on, and then when it's over you're feeling pretty depressed. The instrumentals go nowhere, and sound like a band who wants to be Pink floyd, but desperately, desperately fails. They're just sound that they probably made just to take up time; not that they needed to do that because the album is long enough. The songs are long. And not for a reason; they drag on for minutes upon minutes, building you up with expectancy, then they end. The whole album leaves you hanging in the dark corners of space hoping a ship comes to get you. Why be lost when you don't need to be. A pointless 80 minutes of weird, dark, pointlessness."
2,intelectual music,"Had the lateralis copy and could not wait to listen to it, then when listening to it I thought to myself intelectual sounding music--loved though the song watch the weather change. Sound was too techie, had all these formats, but one thing only was that it lacked to me the driving bass lines of paul d'amour so out with it to have maggots somewhere."
2,They've lost their edge,"Yep, fraid so...When I first saw tool I was impressed. They seemed to be offering something new, dynamic and impressive.But really, there are only so many mysterious songs about taking it in the arse you can write before you bore your audience silly.A few albums down the track I'm bored. If you've never heard tool much and like their sound, give yourself a couple of albums before finding something else to get into...these guys are too much of a one trick pony. Sad to say, but true."
5,Quite a CD!,"The first full-lenghth album for Tool in five years since Tool's 1996 release of Aenema, you should buy this CD if you don't have it! I have three of their albums), there great! Wonder when they will release a new one?"
2,Something lost.,"The thing i liked about Tool was their originality. No other bamd ever sounded like tool, even though some tried (earshot anyone?)With this album Tool pretty much ditched heavy metal altogether... It's not a bad album, just not up to Tool standards..."
2,Unbelievbly dissapointing!!!!!!!!,"hello....my name is jack and im probably the biggest Tool fan in Massachusetts and what i have to say may freak the fans of tool to death when i tell them them that this is the a horribly annoying album.....it seems that Maynard had rushed it alittle with his songs that are just plain boring and repetitive.......Although ""The Grudge"" and Schism"" are pretty good songs everything else on that cd is just plain worthless....it kills me to say something like this about my all time favorite band but theres no denying the truth to this one......to all you tool rookie's pick up undertow,Salival and AEnima before you go near this one or this album may scare you away from tool's real talentthank you and a good night to all"
5,Spent Nuclear Rocket Fuel,"Tool Lateralus.I'd describe it as a harsh, inventive, angry yet solemn funeral dirge sung by aliens from the planet ""Anvil"".The drum work is deceptively awesome - and if you have the patience to listen to the whole thing from beginning to end, it pays off in the same bent way as an ice cream headache, or the way you felt when you realized your pet parakeet 'Tookey' wasn't really playing the stiff-quiet-birdie-haha game.-Dan P Los Altos, California"
5,great buy!!,"if you are a real rock fan and enjoy bands such as Deftones, Spineshank, Staind, A Perfect Circle, etc. you will love this new cd. Leteralus is a breath of fresh air and a slightly different sound for Tool that new listeners and die-hard Tool fans will appreciate. Most of you with a halfway descent radio station in town have probably heard ""Schism"" which is most like Tool's sound on their other cd's but songs like ""Parabola"" and ""Mantra"" are good examples of the new Tool sound so please download the free samples and definitely buy this cd!!"
5,What did you expect?,"This is just the next step in the progression of Tool. I haven't gotten this excited about a cd since Fantastic Planet by Failure was released. The thing is, I wasn't all that excited about it till I heard it. It just plain blew me away. I've had it for about a week now and I still haven't listened to anything else since. This is a very MOODY album. You will be shocked at the ease that Tool speeds up and slows down 3 and 4 times in the same song perfectly. This is a masterpiece that will be appreciated for a long time to come! Enough said."
5,Worth the Wait,"It's been 5 long years, but this album is worth the wait. Buy it now, support the band, they deserve every penny. Every song is filled with vivid emotions, each lyric has it's hidden meanings. It's simply a brillant album."
5,"Way to go, Tool","This is what I expected from Tool. The music is much like Undertow and Aenima, with a slight difference. I don't really know what the difference is, but I like it.Many people have been thinking this new album was going to veer towards the style of A Perfect Circle. While I admire and own A Perfect Circle's Mer de Noms, it just isn't Tool. Laterlus isn't Mer de Noms. It is Tool. Pure, plain, great Tool.All the Tool lovers out there, if for some reason you are contemplating buying this album, you need to get it. It is moving, emotional, and just awesome. Everything you have heard from Tool, and everything you think to expect from Tool, is in Laterlus."
5,No AEnima but a good album no less.,"Tools most recent album that includes the overplayed hit Schism is a good album regardless of what others say. See it in concert and you will know what i mean. This album sheds light on the other side of Tool. Some people said they sold out. I must ask to whom. This album was different from the others in the aspect that Maynards lyrics changed somewhat from blasphemy to another type of intellect. This album has some mathematical terms both as lyrics and as titles but it in no way is a nerd album. Maynard himself said that it is about time we differentiate ourselves from our surroundings and intergrate our problems into our lives. I think this album is great, perhaps not as good as AEnima but a great buy."
5,Tool's 4th Triumph,"Lateralus continues Tool's legacy. Maynard sings as he never has before, reaching new heights of vocal perfection. The album is a work of genius, and well worth the weight. Some choise picks: ""Schism"", with its fast, terse, scaling vocals, ""Ticks & Leeches"" which shows off Carey's skills as a drummer and Maynard at his most aggressive, and of course ""Lateralus"", which begins with about a minute of slow building, then explodes into an incredible orgy. Five thumbs up for Maynard, Adam, Justin, and Danny."
5,Sweet,"This is by far there best album, it seems more grown up and alot better done, there alot of tracks that are long but it is very good A++++++++ Buy this CD"
5,Oh....My.....God,"I bought this album not being a huge Tool fan and just buying out of curiosity. What I didn't expect was musical genius. It is a difficult album, but it will grow on you I'm sure if you don't like it. Buy this masterpiece. Support Tool. My favorites are: The Patient, Parabol/Parabola, Lateralis (intentionally spelled wrong.), and Disposition/Reflection/Triad. WARNING: Faiip de Oiad will make you fear for your life :) . Lateralus Forever!!"
5,Progressive Metal Landmark,"Progressive rock/metal is one of my favorite genres and Tool's Lateralus is up there with the best albums I have experienced. Some of the best progressive music out there along with Queensryche's ""Operation: Mindcrime"" and Dream Theaters ""Images and Words"", possibly even better but I'd rather not compare albums. Their sound expanded from Aenima a lot along with a more structured sound and cleaner production. The songs are so different from each other such as heavier tracks like ""Ticks and Leeches"", the disturbing and intense ""Faaip De Oiad"" and the epic 3 track song ""Disposition"", ""Reflection"" and ""Triad"" which is one of the greatest songs ever recorded. Lateralus is a lot different from the bands out there today, it shows how Tool are unique and write intelligent music."
5,Lateralus or Aenima!,"Difficult to say which I prefer, Lateralus or Aenima. I don't know but I'm sure It's one the best band I've ever listen to. All is perfectly coordinated, sounds, voice of Maynard.... I like it and I almost regret there's only three albums."
5,One of the best CDs I have ever bought!,"I think that this album is the best one that Tool has put out yet! From the very beginning this CD grabs you and doesn't let go until the very end. It is amazing how Maynard's voice can sound so soothing at times, and other times sound so intense. The bass riffs that Justin goes into still have me blown away after almost 2 years of listening to it. Adam is by far one of the most talented guitarist today. And the fact that he directed almost all of their videos is very impressive to me. Finally, the drumming on this album is AMAZING! Every drum beat that Danny does sounds absolutely amazing, I have never heard drumming quite as good as his. All in all, I think that this CD is a must have for anyone that likes music!"
2,"Radio Rawk, nothing more.","I dont know what the hype is. So they can play in 7/8, whoopee. Its basic radio rawk. If you really want to to hear adventurous challenging heavy modern music pick up some Spiral Architect, Martyr's ""Warp Zone"", or ""Led Circus"" by Simon Steensland! The best part about this CD is the cover."
1,this is boring as donkey poop,Oh my god if you buy this listen to it in short bursts if you try and listen to the whole thing in one go you'll fall asleep trust me.Not only is it mind-nubingly boring it stinks too repetitve irritating guitars and vocals.
1,SNOOZE FEST,"This album bores me to death. No kind of excitement or catchy riffs, nothing. It reminds me of some kind of Hindu meditation music. I'll stick with Slayer, In Flames, and Slipknot."
1,what a horrible album........,"not only was it incredibly neanderthalish lyrically, but the music took a nosedive as well. carrey's drums, once one of the mightiest, have become a complete and total joke. what a pity. save your money........"
1,Nothing worth the wait,"waiting for the new tool album for like 5 years you can imagine the complete bitter dissapointment when I heard schism the first single and absolute crap song that needs to be half as long sure long songs worked out on aenima because it was an amazing album but this album is listless trash. Probably one of the biggest let downs in the last five years in music. Tool became pretty much nothing more than sellouts. By the time you hear tracks like ticks and leaches or lateralus you'll plead for the horrid music to stop, tool's creativity has run it's course, every music video is the same claymation etc... If tool would've left it with just aenima and undertow they could've went down as one of the best bands of the 90's as well as respectable, but now with lateralus they've destroyed any credibility they had as musicians, even mer de noms was a better album."
1,The Second Coming of Yes,"My theory is that Rick Wakeman (frontman of Yes and public enemy #1) is the bassist for Tool, and he writes all of the music. It is seriously that bad. I've never really liked this band but before my biggest complaint was the childish anti-christian lyrics. Now I dislike them for all the same resons I dislike Yes and the Alan Parsons Project. Maybe next they'll do an album about stonehenge. That'll be rad. In the meantime all you sheep-like drones can sit around and pretend that time signature changes constitutes ""brilliant music""."
1,urg,"Remember trhey days when metal was actually quite fun when bands like Iron Maiden, Cradle of Filth and Metalica rulled with songs about...........well it never really matterd you could go to a concert fully aware that you never really needed to care about the lyrics and you just had to bang your head too and there was always a giant skull to be seen.Ah but then nirvana came alng and everything changed these days tool and their like rule their world of metal and without any of the fun that their the old guard possesed you now really do have to think about the lyrics because the music is so unlistanable its a shame because metal should never be like that hopefully another spinal tap will come along and expose this music for the sham it is."
2,Tool in a not so interesting jam session,"Some people are into this style, I personally am not. That is, songs that are not catchy, do not have very interesting melodies or arrangements or discernible parts (verse, chorus, bridge, etc). The songs on this album come across more as a jam session that Tool is meandering through. It just sort of goes on and on and there are few memorable moments. As I said, if you're into that, as it is clear that many people here are, then this may be your thing. I prefer the Tool on ""Undertow"" (Prison Sex and Sober both being standout tracks on that album)."
3,"No longer ""prime"" material","This cd is DEFINITELY NOT worth all the rave reviews it has been receiving. A TOOL fan since the beginning, normally their music leaves me hungering for more. Not the case with this cd. The songs lack those intriguing intricacies and deep meanings that tend to replay themselves in your head. It seems that everyone has jumped on the bandwagon and has given it a 5 star rating simply because it is a TOOL album. Don't be so hasty. There is not a single song that even remotely resembles masterpieces like ""Third Eye"". If your looking to be awe-inspired, search elsewhere within their collection. This album just doesn't quite cut it. A disappointment after waiting eagerly for 5 years. Thank God for limewire."
3,"ok . . not terrible, but come on, they can do better.","I had written a pretty harsh review of this album about a week ago, and I just wanted to change a few things and restate some others. First, I still think Aenema is a better album . . and I don't think they were taking it in a different direction, as far as the album title, or the song titles, they're just the same old TOOL, I don't think they're in any 'different' direction what so ever. The album still sounds like what didn't work for Aenema, and by saying that I mean it just sounds TOO MUCH like Aenema, but not as good. I still say it's a dissapointment and that they can do ... a lot better. Come on, we've waited like 5 years and this is the best they can come up with? I'd save my money for the next A Perfect Circle record, atleast we can guarantee it will sound original and new."
1,album is horrible,"this isn't music, and either is the other tool albums. i'd give it 0 stars if i could"
1,BOO,That Schism song sucks ass its easily the worst song I've ever heard. When it came on the radio I wanted to rip my ears off!
1,masterwork??? I think not.,It's amazing how people overrate this band so much and use words like masterwork to describe this album. They obviously don't listen to anything else so there is nothing se for them to compare it too. There is way better music out there then this crap.
2,One Great Song among many bad ones.,I bought this CD thinking I love the song Schism so even if the rest of the CD is just OK it will be worth the money. I was wrong. The CD is just boring. With the exception of Schism the entire CD is forgettable. This was the first Tool CD I have ever bought and it's also the last.
1,is this it?,"The only good songs are the grudge and schism and the rest are slow, boring and forgetable."
1,Wow,"I can't stand bands that try desperately to be ""deep."" Sure the complexity of the meanings of the songs can be deciphered by an eight year old, but on top of that the music quality is terrible. I can't believe I spent money on this CD. At least it will make a good frisbee, but not as good of a frisbee as those free AOL CDs."
3,Hauntingly surprising.,"At first I only bought this cd for ""Schism"" when I hear dit on the ... music awards ... I later saw the music video which also haunted me. This is a good cd for anyone willing to try something different. The words are very meaningful also as well as the tone. I give this cd 3 stars for its ingenious use of imagery and beautifully structured songs."
3,"Not bad,not great",Evidently the metal darlings have been listening to some Moroccan stuff recently. They dilute it and throw it in here. The drummer still can't finish his fills and has very stiff hands. Typical metal in your face bass line and truly lousy lyrics. Better than most in this genre but nothing really interesting.
5,TOOL fans rejoice,"Having to wait 5 years for this album, it definately is worth the wait. Something that is quickly noticable is the heavy ""surreal"" aspect of the album, not unlike 'third eye.' Instead of having only 15 min of this, we basically have a whole album. Not only are they able to pull this off well, they have been able to combine the feel of opiate and undertow with this surreal imagery, coming out on top with a more emotional (but still TOOL) sound. This is their most abstract release, so those 3 1/2 min radio fans out there, it's probably a good idea to stay away."
3,disappointed,"I just got the cd today and listened to the whole thing through. This CD isnt as good as Tool's other CDs. There arent any pure, clean, heavy tool songs on the album. Every once in a while you hear something that sounds like the classic Tool sound but most of it is slow drums and synthesized noises. I cant believe they spent so long in the studio with this almbum and did not live up to our expectations."
3,Pretty neat!!,"This is a pretty neat album, one for music lovers of the world. Tool have a pretty keen musical sense, too; I wish them luck in the future!!!"
4,Be patient,"I've had this album almost 3 years now and I continue to enjoy it. There are alot of heavy songs and alot of soft songs, which I think are perfectly balanced out. Even though ""Disposition"" only contains 2 lines of lyrics (repeated over and over), its one of my favorites off here. The guitar line in ""Lateralis"" is phenomonel, the song starts out with it and then the band comes in... wow! Alot of people might not think this as their best album, but I think it's pretty damn good. The band has yet to disapoint me and hopefully their new album will be just as good!"
4,"Complex, challenging, and rewarding","It's obvious Tool has always striven for complexity, but this time they've nearly outdone themselves. Staccato drumming, surprising song structures, tempo changeups, power chords that appear out of nowhere; even Maynard's vocals get lost in the chaos sometimes. The plaintive melodies so apparent in much of Aenima are hard to find here -- maybe Maynard used them all up in his A Perfect Circle project -- but if you're looking for music with strength, conviction, and integrity, you could do a lot worse than Lateralus. The music is dense and relentless and may take a few listens to fully appreciate: keep this in mind. But all in all, well done, Tool. Thanks for another great album."
5,Phenominal,"A mixture of grudge, metal and alternative rock, this album reflects what rock should be: loud, hard, fast, but soft in the right places, with those pleaserable little tweaks in between like 'Mantra' and 'Eon Blue Apocalypse' and 'Faaip De Oiad' that calm you down before the next song. The title track is awesome, building up and up into a driving cresendo that blows the listener away. Not frightening, like their last album, but not so comforting either, as we learn when the album ends with 'Faaip De Oiad'. It's as if Tool picked up where Zeppilin left off: this is what Led would sound like now, if John hadn't died, and they had lived to be a hundred years. Music at its strongest, and I eagerly await their next album, which should be coming along in five more years,"
5,Give it a break,"I know some hate Tool...But I don't think Tool's intent was to make themselves a metal band....it's jus the notion everyone has about them. If I remember they always thought of themselves as a form of art. True the music may not be really upbeat, and they definitely don't have a billion solos lol, but that's not the point..you have to listen to this music, open up and let it take you somewhere, it DOES take a few listens though..cuz most albums this long do jus ramble on and on and on...but you can't expect this to be your master of puppets, justice for all, or any metal album seriously..so if you like metal..fine, but Tool is not thatttt bad and this album in it's on right deserves recognition. It's rare that an album this inaccessible becomes a commercial success"
5,Classic Tool,"Many have been waiting since '96 for some new Tool and here it is. And its for real, no hype. You will not be let down."
5,Great band,"Tool is a rare occurrence in today's music environment of simple lyrics and uncomplicated sounds.Their music is extremely nuanced and intricate and is a pleasure to discover and listen to again and again. The lyrics have a profundity that most musicians today only dream of attaining, and they address a wide variety of human thought, emotion, and experience. This, along with Aenima, and most especially Salival will bring you hours of listening enjoyment."
4,Good Stuff,"I'd heard a few of the songs on the radio and thought I'd give the CD a try. Good, strong music; I'll probably buy more of their work later on."
5,Best Tool Album,"Opiate, Undertow, Aenima and Salivla are all awesome but Lateralus is the best. The bass, drums and guitar are much better on this cd than any other tool cd. This is an incredible cd and everyone who likes Tool should get it. Tool sounds like no other band and this cd proves it the best. A 5 out of 5. A much better buy then the horrible new weezer album."
4,Not the best TOOL album,"Not what I eagerly expected after the long wait. While this album has it's moments, it doesn't come close to Undertow or Aenima. Not even close. Obviously each member of the band has enormous talent....but the songs don't give you anything to grab onto and listen to all day. It's just not there. I know all of you diehard TOOL fans give it 5 stars just because of who they are, but face it, this album is just a little better than Opiate, if at all. Not that topping their last two would have been easy, but c'mon....this is the best TOOL could do after 5 years? Did Maynard spread himself a little thin??? Only gave it four stars because compared to the other music out there, it's good."
3,good but not great,"All the people who say that this is better than Underthow or Aenima are stupid. This cd is good but not great. Their previous cd's were heavier and better. Tracks 1,5,7,8,9 are pretty good. #8 is the best (more like the old stuff). The last 3 songs pretty much """". If you wanna hear real Tool, buy Underthow or Aenema."
3,Proof that music is not as good as it used to be...,"Now I've listened to this album many times, have had it forced down my throat many more times, but I still come to the same conclusion: It's not up to the Tool standard.The most amazing thing about Tool's previoius albums were how much each instrument (including vocals) were integral in each song. Stand alone, each part is interesting; As a whole, it's phenomonal. On Lateralus, however, many things fall apart. Most notably are the lead vocals in my opinion. Many times I find Maynard just singing what the guitar is playing...Schism being the most obvious example of it. Are there moments of Tool Genious? There sure are. Does anything on this album compare to the feeling you get after listening to all of Undertow, or the amazement in your eyes after lying on the floor listening to Third Eye blaring out of your speakers? Not for me. My expectations were high, but not unreasonable. Tool has fallen from being an experience and is now a mortal band."
5,A Disappointment,"Wait, Why did I say a Disappointemnt if I gave it five stars. Simple. This CD while compared to Aenima, Opiate, and undertow, is just that. However it says nothing bad for this CD only good things about their previous work.This stands as one of my favorite Albums, From Lateralis (spelled that way becasue I have a typo'ed copy I bought the day it came out) to their scary Ticks & Leeches, it is amazing.This CD is awesome, but listen to their previous work first that will open your minds eye, only then will you appreciate this.My third eye is open."
4,Good but not great,This Tool album was a bit more abstract and industrial then some of the other albums. I don't think it was as ground breaking as AEnima or Undertow.
3,Tool Have Stagnated...,"Okay, this is the album that i thought would renew my faith in 21st Century rock. I thought that after 5 years Tool would come out with with something fresh and devestating... but they didn't. People are so full of praise for tool because they have 'their own sound', the problem is: that it is their only sound. Tool have become their own worst enemy as far as creativity goes because here is an album where the same guitar tones, the same chords, the same song structures occur over and over... Even the most fluid songs on this album seem forced, it's almost as if Tool have to keep reminding themselves ""We're an intelligent rock band"". This is a very subjective topic I know, but I like a band to evolve with every album to the point where after 3 albums they sound sonically and emotionaly detatched from the band who made the 1st. Others like a band to stick to their guns and essentially that is what tool have done here. The trouble being , it's just getting a little trite."
5,Best CD of All time,"Lateralus by TOOL is quite possibly the best rock album of all time. The music is so layered and deep, I can't even begin to describe it. Lateralus is much like Aenima, but is a step above it, musically. I've been listening to Aenima for years now, usually a cd spends a couple months at most in my CD player and then I don't pick it up for a while. But I've been listening to Aenima since 1997, and i think Lateralus is even better. As far as I can tell it's impossible to get tired of Tool's music. I can't pick a favorite Tool song because every single one is incredibly good. However when it comes to the albums, I would say they've been getting better and better. And if you don't have Lateralus get it NOW."
5,Weeping with joy,"It makes me almost come to tears. To hear such passion, thought, effort, etc. Why must we compare things to their predecessors? This is the logical progression. Come along and study this album. Quit worrying about what Maynard is wearing and go inside yourself. Gain experience, re-evaluate, etc. The album is superb. Own it."
5,"Um ah, yeah its Tool","After listening to the band since their beginnings I say they really developed into a consistant hit-machine. Not that they have gone pop but the music sticks inside your head.They seem to have shed off some of the old influences for prog bands such as King Crimson, and Yes. The opening figure a 5/8 groove with a ascending 3rd motive where each note enters on beat 4 of the groove when finished its statement creates a overall feeling of 4/4. They are a band where the music is built of layers of ideas. Harmonically the are not as adventrous as they are rhythmically; still dealing with the consistant harmonic language almost all heavy bands use. With all that aside the music which is most important sounds great, though I cannot help get the feeling that they have been listening to Tortise an awful lot(not that thats bad). Great music! long live Tool (or until they suck)"
3,Maynard is a funny guy...,"Yes,Maynard, you have to go to the bathroom. So why did you write a song about it?! Oh and tell your fellow bandmates to write songs in different keys instead of D Minor and E Minor all the time!!"
2,"Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of ""music"" ....","I bought the album this morning, and I've been listening to it most of the day. It's loaded with repeated rifs and heavy guitar and continuous and monotonous ""songs"". They all seem to blend together and relfect a lot of the same sounds of the last album, AEnima. I loved AEnima. But, Lateralus doesn't even come close. It's kinda like a really poor re-mix. It's just endless, repeated sound. After such a long delay between releases, I would have expected something a lot more unique and desireable. It sounds like they put out this album for the sole purpose of putting out an album. Unimpressive at best."
2,Schism is good - The rest is uninspired.,"Schism is an excellent track, but unfortunately the rest of the album is a series of uninspiring, unmelodic songs that drone, for the most part, in E-minor. Tool put alot of time into the song Schism and the album cover, but needed to pay more attention to making a complete album. I was dissappointed."
5,Hauntingly Coincidental,"First: as far as concept albums go, this one is tighter than anything from Rush or The Beatles. The mood that Tool creates -dark paranoia- is held and developed throughout. It's not for everyday listening, it isn't background music. This album is a feature in and of itself.Second: these guys are so technically correct and intricate in their arrangements that even the snootiest poseur will have to admit that this album has admirable stature. I am a musician and find myself challenged to even identify the structures used.Third: It's scary how circumstantially appropriate this album is; i.e. when listening to it, I have found the words to be eerily applicable to the situations/mind set that I am in too many times to call it coincidence. Very powerful throughout."
3,"No masterpiece, but still worth a listen","Through it all Lateralus isn't a bad listen. It's very interesting at times. At times it's difficult to tell if Lateralus is nu-metal masquerading as prog rock or if it's prog rock masquerading as nu-metal. Overall, though, I think there's way too much filler on this album posing as art. Most of the songs are very simplistic (although the drummer manages to beat out some interesting rhythms at times). And nearly all of the times Maynard's lyrics remain in the realm of pseudo-intellectualism. He's definitely a competent vocalist but he's definitely no Yeats or Dylan Thomas when it comes to lyrics. This album is worth the purchase, but just barely."
4,"This is what you wanted, this is what you had in mind?",Well this is what youre getting. This CD is tight. Its more like one long song. Maybe 2. Its hypnotic. Youll find yourself listening to it at all times. You will find yourself talking about this cd at all times. Youll find that its a lot like their second cd. Youll make a mix tape with the best of their last 4 releases and youll be happy.
1,Substandard Text or Reference on RF Electronics.,This is a required text for a graduate level RF electronics course I am taking. I am very disappointed with this text. There are multiple mistakes and misprints throughout. It seems that the book was proofed by someone who is not familiar with electronic symbology and notation. There are many instances where inconsistant notation will be used within a single example problem! The author is very short on many subjects and longwinded on others. This book makes for a confusing and frustrating read despite the distinguished IEEE brand on the cover. My professor even commented on the sloppyness of the author. I have had to buy additional books to suppliment my studies. This is not a good reference or text book....Coming from someone who has read multiple technical text books...Beware of this one.
4,model airplane kit,I was dissapointed in the fact that this kit was a used kit. It had been opened and a few of the small parts are missing. I don't think I will be buying any more kits from you.
2,Regret that i bought it.,"Stock made from cheap plastic. If you want to install it in a5 2011 and newer, you must to find o-ring that did not come with this stock."
1,disapointing,"My son asked for this for christmas...he was excited to get it...while putting it together as he screwed in the screws, the plastic snapped...very poor item .disappointed...i sent it back"
2,looks cool but broke,came pretty quick and very easy to install but yesterday i went playing and it broke off on the third game it brokebuy at ur own risk
1,Junk,"This stock is a dangerous piece of junk. Do not buy it!My new stock (less than an hour of use) broke at the pin connections and flew off the gun allowing the spring and pin to fly out of the gun. The person firing the gun at the time was hit in the cheek and injured! My A5 was at proper pressure.UPDATE: Tried to get this item replaced or refunded through ""Ultimate Paintball"". Each time I called I was told they would look into it and get back to me. Nothing was ever done. Do NOT buy from them."
4,Decent - I like it,"Some of the more hardcore scenario players - or those that are turning their paintball guns into realistic looking weapons (which I feel is totally unnecessary) - probably won't be crazy about this stock. Personally, I like it a lot, it is extremely easy to install, fully adjustable for close quarters and standard play, and although it IS a LITTLE wobbly it feels very sturdy when in the firing position.I only gave it 4 stars because it is made of a hard plastic and composite parts (which isn't necessarily a bad thing because it's light BUT it won't hold up to as much wear and tear as an aluminum or metal one would)."
4,Great Value,Very pleased with quality. I think this is as good as you can get without spending a lot more for a stock made from aluminum. I am ordering a 2nd one for my son.
5,Great Stock,Installed easily. Isn't loose and does not wobble at all. It makes holding and aiming the marker so much better. Also looks great on my A-5!!!
4,ehh ok,The stock was ok nothing to special the only thing i didnt like is after installing it to my A-5 it was wobbly but its not to noticble
3,ok its on,"the thing fits and does the trick but you have to keep hand tightning the screw at the bottem of the lever that you use to adjust the stock, it doesnt feel cheep or anything but doesent say tippmann on it eaither, if you dont want to pay the big fees that tippmann suck outta you that already spent like 400 plus dollers on their products anyway then buy this just to piss them off. but if your looking for top of the line then buy the tippmann one from their website you will be happier with it."
4,Great stock for the money!,"This stock works great for the price you pay. I mean really, its only 15 dollars.. what do you expect? Its sturdy, has a good feel to it, and instantly makes the A5 more comfortable to hold. It was very easy to install, only took about 5 minutes. Yes, there is a SLIGHT wobble, but really, it is hardly noticeable once you have the gun on your shoulder, and will not affect the performance at all. I love the ability to adjust the length of the stock too. I would definitely recommend this product for your A5. A cheap, easy way to upgrade its looks and performance."
1,TERRIBLE - DO NOT BUY,"If you value the safety of yourself and those around you, and the well being of your gun, DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAPThe connection points snapped within literally, the first couple of shots fired (within 3 minutes of it's first use). The stock fell to the ground, along with my entire bolt assembly. Fortunately, I nor anyone else was injured from this accident, but I pray that every one else unfortunate enough to buy this stock experiences the same luck.DO NOT BUY THIS STOCKPLASTIC CONNECTION POINTS FAIL VERY EASILYLOOK ELSEWHERELOOK FOR STOCKS WITH METAL CONNECTORSFOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT BUY THIS STOCK"
1,Cheap stock,I used this stock one time and after an hour of use it snapped where it connects to the gun. I would spend a little extra money to buy a more durable stock.
1,Review,Birthday present for Grandson. Broke first use. Seems like the attachment was really poor. Mounting brackets where stock attaches to gun very small.
1,"Do not buy, it will break","I should of known better, but I thought I would give it a try and I am sorry I did. Amazon and the suppliers should pull this off the site, it breaks just like all the reviewers said it would. Please view the picture I uploaded, this happened before I even used the marker in the field."
1,"Don't buy, check for heavy composite plastic product.","Don't buy, check for heavy composite plastic product. Broke 5 hours into the game, was able to save rod and spring."
1,this item brakes very easy,i suggest that you do not buy this stock for the tippmann a5 because the stock comes completly off the bar and it brakes very easy
2,Waste of $12,"Bought this stock thinking it was a great deal and ""HEY! its prime also!""There is a reason its discounted so much...Broke within the first 2 minutes of use. Literally crumbled apart. The problem was the connection point is really bad plastic and crumbled like a dry cookie. Would have returned it but the return window is very small....So now I'm out 12 dollars...DON'T buy this!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,Its pretty good actually,"First off, I got this stock from Academy in January, and I paid roughly $35-$40 for it. I've been using it on a 2011 A-5 marker that I bought the same day, and I haven't had a single issue with it, with the exception of its REALLY hard to remove if I need to take down my marker for cleaning etc. the stock (for me at least) is rugged and can handle abuse. you can't ADS(Aim down Sights) with this stock on if you have a mask, which would make it difficult if you have it on a sniper rifle, but otherwise its really not that difficult to take shots without the sights, just watch where your paint is going and walk it in."
4,Pretty Good!,"I got this at a store, and i took it out into a few big games. for plastic it is really sturdy. Easy to install. i wish it was made out of metal, but it still is really tough. people who say this is bad are idiots"
1,Garbage!!!!,"Bought this new from Amazon. Received adjustable stock on Friday Aug. 5 2011 and used it the next day. It only lasted about 700 rounds, until the front of the stock that connects to the marker broke at two different locations. Lower mount where pin goes through broke in half, which caused upper mount to flex and crack. The price for this item is very reasonable, but the quality is also very cheap."
2,You get what u paid for it,This stock had an amazing look to it but it isn't as durable as the gun. Depending on your style of play this may not be the best choice for you. My first time using it it broke when I was running and took cover next to a tree the stock hit the tree and it cracked. So if you are a run and gun type of player I don't recommend this for you.
1,Piece of junk,"The first time i took this paint balling, the rear square connector piece snapped. Piece of crap. I VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
5,its all not the descendents,"its a great album full of poppy songs like pretty little girl and sex in the way, which are typical all songs. however they sound nothing like my world and bikage, some of the descendents signature songs.just because they have similar members does not mean they have similar sounds"
3,Too repetitive spacesynth,"I really can't understand why Michiel and Erik didn't use a little bit more imagination when they were making this album. I heard that Technological Mind was produced very quickly and unfortunately it shows. Okay, there are some great leads and chord melodies. Sound quality is better than on previous albums but all the tracks are *very* similar. Those same song structures and drum sequences keep repeating all the time and the album gets damn boring after a few tracks. Can space synth music actually get any simpler than this? Technological Mind would be one of the best Laserdance albums if it had a bit more variety. It's a little bit difficult to name favorite tracks of this album because they all are so similar but I like 'Warriors', 'Dead Star' and 'Sky Orbit'. 'Technoid' is good too although the three mixes are an overdose."
3,Can space synth music get any simpler than this?,"Basically there's only one track because they all sound so similar. However, if you like straightforward synth music then you may like this."
2,Estuche de utilería,"El producto no fue de mi satisfacción. Es verdad que es muy económico, pero de haber sabido lo endeble que era no lo hubiera comprado. Parece un estuche de ""utilería"", como para usarse en una obra de teatro y no como protección para un instrumento musical.Aunque suponga una mayor inversión, les recomiendo adquirir un producto con estructura más sólida."
1,"Nice pictures, but where's the information","This book is great to look at, but that's as far as it goes. I know a picture says a thousand words, but not in this book. For a person travelling to a country for the first time, I want to know as much information as possible about each place that I may go. This book only briefly covers the big cities and main ""tourist"" places, which is a shame because there are many tourist places that are not even mentioned. There is no guide to the animals you could see when on safari or drive by on a tour. Kwa-Zulu Natal should not be referred to as Zululand due to the Theme Park feel it gives to the traditions of a culture. I found that I used other people's Lonely Planet and Let's Go! guides and after awhile I took this guide out of my day pack."
5,Very good single,"Another very good work from Iron Maiden. If you like Iron, you must have this one. It has two previously unreleased tracks that are Blood Brothers (Orchestral Version) and Pass the Jam. The orchestral version from Blood Brothers is amazing, and Pass the Jam is a very good B' side, one of the best in the last years, that show that Iron Maiden do more good songs than the ones released in studio albums. Indicated for any Iron Maiden fan."
4,wilder,"the band sounds like they got their battery recharged with the welcome return of Dickinson and Smith on the Brave New World album; and this new song from the Dance Of Death album finds Maiden in fine form. sounds like they are getting a little more comfortable with the three guitar set up and utilizing a stronger sense of melody and a more anthemic approach to songwriting that harkens back to the band's Powerslave album. the glory days are back again, so it seems."
3,a miss,"though a spanish modern movie (which are generaly very good), this one fails.story line is a litle pale, and the overwhelming tango parts are too much for my taste."
5,Wonderful,"Carlos Saura strikes again with an Argentine version of his ""Carmen"". Great dancing, great music and a dialog that wraps the whole thing in an interesting enigma."
1,"Great film, bad DVD","I originally saw this movie in the theater and loved it; unfortunately, the DVD was defective - I could not, however hard I tried, eliminate the commentary. I had originally purchased ""Tango"" in 2007 and that DVD, too, had the same problem. Maybe Criterion can come up with a better version, in which case, I'll give it 5 stars!"
1,Disappointing Tango Movie,"An acquaintance knew of my passion for dancing Argentine Tango and recommended this film. Unfortunately, I could hardly stay awake and even if I could've, why would I have wanted to? Different strokes for different folks, but I found the movie utterly boring and disappointing. But then, I don't like Les Miserables either."
1,DVD,The DVD that was sent to me was not as advertised. It was a different cover displaying Japanese/Chinese words.This version was made for the Oriental marketQuestion :- Why was I sent this. ?However....I have got a refund....but I am still left WITHOUT the English subtitled version.What do you suggest ??
5,Fantastic,"The story develops through beautiful tango dance and music. It is about a love affair between a director and a tango dancer. A director assigns a young tango dancer a role of his work. Through tango, they gradually be in love. The development of the story does not depend on a lot of conversation. Rather, the story develops with tango. Such expression style is unique, interesting, and attractive. The movie include a lot of dance scenes and beautiful tango music. You must see it. It is fantastic."
3,Very arty,Really watched this for the Tango dancing which was very good. Very simple story line so could follow it with my reasonable Spanish. No good if you dont speak any Spanish.
2,No talent movie,"This movie is supposed to be about Tango - a dance! Yet is has no talented dancers in it. Juan Carlos Copes is all washed up. Thirty some years of same old steps and same old music and same old tricks. Cecilia Narova is a worse female dancer than Julio Bocca as a female dancer. Mia Maestro is nice looking, but that's about it. Carlos Rivarola has nothing to offer, zip, nada. He is there because the producer used him in the ""Tango Bar"" movie a few years back. Carlos Saura obviously knows nothing about Tango, otherwise why would he ignore the best tango dancers in the world, who were there in Buenos Aires, right under his nose, but are not seen on this no talent movie."
1,Tango,I was extremely dissapointed - there was NO movie at all - just dialogue about the scenes in the making of the movie - a total waste of money!
1,A major snooze,Pretentious fare perfect for the artsy-fartsy crowd this film has no plot to speak of and is memorable only for one of two modestly intereting dance sequences. Problem is there are far too many of them. A tango instruction video would be better.
1,at best a disappointment,"This film was described by the NY Times television section as ""transfixingly beautiful"" and indeed it was in its original and uncluttered version. I could hardly wait to order my own DVD to watch at leisure and enjoy the gorgeous dancing, exquisite music and beautiful people I had seen at my first viewing on PBS.The version I received from Amazon has a horrible voiceover by the producer and starring dancer. It was like listening to a concert with somebody coughing next to me all night. In short the voiceovers destroyed the mood of the film, made the music almost inaudible, and the movie was so annoying that it bacame impossible to watch.Don't buy this DVD. It is awful."
3,"Good, but not great","This film was good, not great. Also, the all-encompassing title ""Tango"" suggests a historical account, which the film mostly is. However, it neglected to credit the Afro Argentinian and Afro Cuban contribution to this Art form, apart from a fleeting suggestion that greatness in dance, music, and tango dancing might necessarily be the result of African genes.Film makers who claim to document events or art history have a moral obligation to give a truthful and accurate account. Thus, to leave out the contributions of Africans, African dance and music, especially because Africans were brutally treated and continue to be severely oppressed, is unforgivable."
4,Learn to dance Argentine Tango from this movie,"Beginners - you will have troubled following most of the material even with the rewind and slow motion buttons.Intermediate/Advance Dancers - you will get some good ideas.Accomplished Amateurs - you will see nothing new.As a movie, the story line is very simple and not particularly moving, but it was beautifully done."
3,"Great moments, no story","I don't really understand why so many tango movies seem like they would be better as a series of short films. But I have yet to see a decent whole one.This is the most extreme of the lot: some gorgeous and touching scenes (I especially like the girls-only scene, and the old musicians jamming), but on the whole the movie is ridiculous and immature. It looks like it should be ripped for MTV."
1,Tango,"Where is dancing? Where is tango dancing in this movie called ""Tango""? Where are the beautiful ladies dancing tango? I mean, Julio La Bocca is good, but he is not my type of a lady. The choreographies are the worst. Most of the music is boring. There is no story. Dialog...enough said. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Not really a movie,"The dancing can be quite captivating at times, but this movie really needs some major work in the script department. By and large this is a series of dance sequences loosely (very loosely) tied together with pointless and dull dialogue spoken by uninteresting characters. Plot? People dance in Argentina. That's about it."
5,Un derroche visual sin paralelo,"Un derroche visual y auditivo sin paralelo, como solo Carlos Saura sabe hacerlo, te atrapa en la butaca e inunda tus sentidos. Merece estar es cualquier colección que se precie de respetable. Una de las mejores películas del año."
2,poor,"Horrible letdown. Just voiceovers, and very dull ones at that, of a 'guide' and a dancer. The beautiful shots of Buenos Aires can't save this dismal attempt at presenting the mighty tango. Can't hold a candle to Saura's CARMEN."
5,"Excellent cinematography, a motion picture art piece","Tango is an amazing movie in its exceptional combination of dance, music, camera technique, color, mirrors, and lighting.At several points in this movie I thought to myself: ""Wow, this lighting/camera perspective is perfect, why don't we see more of this in movies?"" After watching the movie once, I found myself immediately going back to re-watch some specific scenes just like one may be drawn back to an especially interesting piece of art.The plot of this movie *is not* what makes this a great picture, although it does effectively tie together the various scenes and the overall context of the film. What makes this a great film are the actors/actresses, dance numbers, music, and cinematography.The english subtitles were clear and easy to read at all times.Overall a very different and entertaining movie... Recommended."
5,candy for the eyes and ears even though the plot is dry,"I could not get enough of this movie because of the way in which the dancing, lighting, music blended beautifully. I have never seen anything like it before. As a matter of fact, I thought it was so invigorating that I watched it three times in a row. As soon as I finished watching this movie I went out to buy the soundtrack because of the outstanding work that was done by Argentinian musician Lalo Schifrin. The only thing that needs work in this movie is the plot. It is not a very good one and leaves you wondering why they paired Elena and Mario in the first place. Nevertheless, the artwork ( choreography, music, and cinematography) of the movie speaks for itself and therefore I give it 5 stars."
2,Whats the point.,"Why do they keep making these films? Plot Summary for ALL Witchcraft movies. Hot girls are introduced early on. Then the ""magic user"" shows up. This person is either a shirtless stud or a female acquaintence (like a neighbor or tour guide). The ""magic user"" is always trying to free a demon or possess a unborn baby. The director pumps a bunch of fake smoke around the set and then they roll the credits. Kinda like a softcore porn with some fangs. The End.This opinion is of the author only. It does not necessarily reflect the views of the Ligonus International Media Corporation or its affiliates."
3,decent game,the darkness is a pretty cool game for some one who doesn't know anything about the comic
3,This game is fun for people who hate fun and have fun hating things.,"I wanted to like this game, I really did. But I didn't. The graphics were fine, the story was good and controls were okay and all that crap but it just wasn't fun. Thinking about stubbing my toe on the coffee table the other day brings back fonder memories than I get from recalling this game, but like Kunta Kinte says ""you don't have to take my word for it."" Now let's be clear, I am not advocating either your purchase or rental of this game. What you need to do is hype it up to a friend of yours who happens to be a little slow in the head. Make him buy it, then just borrow it from him. Then sell it on ebay. Once it's all said and done you will realize that the only value this game has is whatever bidding ends at. There is no non-monetary value in this game, and even that isn't much."
2,Not great,"I enjoyed the demo a little, but not to really make me want the game REALLY bad. Found this one sale, and figured I would give it another chance, and I didnt get really all that much farther than I did with the demo.Some nice visuals, but I couldnt really get into it otherwise."
2,Better on PS3,"Not a bad game, but looks alot better on the PS3. Buy it if you only have a 360 and you dont get a multi choice."
3,Pretty good,"This game was good but I can't take it into the great category. I enjoyed using The Darkness' powers. My biggest issues happen in certain levels when you go into an alternate universe and your fighting Nazis. These levels sometimes got really dark and confusing. It was hard to tell where you were supposed to go sometimes and frustrating because you couldn't see who was shooting at you half the time either. A lot of this seems to fade away when you start gaining abilities like impaling unsuspecting mobsters with your darkness tentacles or picking up a parked car and throwing it at a group of scumbags across the street. Still, something was just lacking from this game. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it and felt it was worth my time."
3,Hoping for something better,Wanted to play this game since it dropped - glad I waited.Gameplay is less than desirable.
3,decent game,The 2nd one that just came out is MUCH better but wanted to give this one a shot. Not so glad i did
4,A Very Unique Game 4 1/2 Stars,"I just purchased this game the other day and so far I'm glad I did. First off, the graphics are amazing. The gameplay is really exciting. Its not your typical shooter where you shoot everything you see. You speak to people and your responses affect the way the game turns out. The demons are nasty, devouring hearts of all the people that you kill. You can also use the demons to find secrets or passageways that your character would not fit in. The soundtrack sounds excellent on 5.1 surround sound. I tried playing versus on xbox live and was a little disappointed. It lagged pretty bad, im sure they will fix that soon. My only other disappointment was that it seems pretty easy so far. I recommend renting this game at the very least. Definitely not as good as Gears of War but I think it's the next best thing."
2,Just couldn't get use to the lighting,"I started playing the game the day it came in, but the lighting in this game is just so dark or murky. I know the game is called the darkness, but does it really need to be so dark you can't see the gun you are carrying or so bright from just one room light that you get a headache. That aside, the gameplay was decent considering the age of the game and I can see why they would make a second one, hopefully with better contrast. It plays well, past the intro where you can't skip it, but heck, who cares, you only gotta go through that once. On top of that, there isn't many games out there where you get to play a mob hitman with inner-issues. I probably would have rated the game higher if I could get past the simple fact that I couldn't sit down and play this game for more than 15 minutes at a time without wanting to shoot myself from the migraines."
3,Fun and fun but don't expect good replayability.,This game is very fun and violent. The first time through was a thrill. The second time through i was able to pay attention to small details and enjoyed it again. Now it's going on my shelf and will probably never be played again.
3,Not great but it had its moments,There were parts of this game that I loved and some that I hated so much I wanted to break the disc. Overall it was a brainless hack-and-slash that was fun.
4,"Kids loved the game, I loved the price!",Video games and kids; an expensive mix. This game was less than half the store price. My son loves it and I saved money. No brainer.
3,my ears,The darkness is a fun and good game you play as a guy named Jackie who on his twenty first birthday finds himself in a world of trouble with the mafia but fortuently he is helped by a demon that calls itself the darkness. The game has an interesting a long story that seems to put to shame many other fps single player games with three different levels of difficuties. The biggest problem I had with this game was the language. While you could turn off the blood and gore the game dropped the f bomb in almost every sentence. The multiplayer is okay as well but you will probably want to play through the story mostly.
4,Good Game,"I enjoyed the game very much. The graphics are very good and the gameplay was consistently entertaining. Considering you can get the game for under 20 bucks, I think its an awesome deal and I highly recommend it."
3,More like Donness,"Great story and great game play, though i didn't care for the aiming in the game. the powers were cool and like i said really good story just not a good game as far as replay value goes."
3,"decent game, under appreciated","While some game flaws kept this game from being great. It is fun to wreak havic with Darklings and the dark powers but controls are not that great. But there is a lot here to enjoy as well, and I got the game for 19.99 so it was well worth the pick up. So I suggest you check it out and I think you will enjoy it."
4,"More action, less talk and travel!",Awesome theme / mechanics / ideas. If you like eating hearts and summoning the dark forces. I think storylines (in general) are overrated. This has too many breaks and jumping around. The mob angle doesnt fit.If you like DARK horrific themes u cant go wrong
3,"Seen, Played Better","What game doesn't look good now on the next gen consoles? Sure, this looks pretty sweet and has some nice supernatural features. The gunplay is pretty average here, and it seems like the whole game was talk to people, take the subway, kill some people. Repeat. Maybe because I am not into the comicbook this was loosely based on, I missed some of the enjoyment. There were some fun portions in this game, but sometimes objectives seemed unclear and the level design questionable(where am I supposed to go?). The game controls fine and has no major problems, but just seemed very average to me. In fact, near the end I was just waiting for it to be over so I could move onto something better. But it sure looks purty."
3,"Average, But Had Some Great Unique Moments","This is an average shooter, but has some fun unique aspects. You have 2 deamon arms that you bring out to do special abilities and eat the hearts of fallen enemies. There are a number of exciting moments, very unique & strange settings, and more. It is fun to play through and see all the sights.Some of the side missions seemed a little tedious and slightly boring. But you always have the choice. It has a very immersive feel in some settings.It isn't a blockbuster shooter like some others, but if you want a fun averge shooter with some unique dark settings this does a good job to fill in between other games."
4,Shattered idols,"XPlay gave this game a horrible rating. Complained how the aiming was done wrong, how some of the missions were based on the first person template and a poorly done story.Thankfully I only watched that review after I bought it, played it, beat it, and was on my way to pick up all the 'side quests'. Thankfully.This game is a lot of fun to play and a story that did not let itself to be known until it was all over. The main character's voice, I felt, was all wrong but did not distract from the fun.During load sequences he talks about the story, the other characters you meet, amusing anecdotes, or just shows him wandering around or his guns. The timing was great since once his story was over, so was the loading time.Not the greatest game of all time, but it does happen to be a lot of fun."
3,Entertaining read....but sketchy research,"Many of the claims made by Knight and Lomas in their book the Second Messiah, gripped my attention, and caused me to read on, but I felt as if some of their connections were loosely drawn and pretty much unsubstantiated.For one thing, they come up with something Rex Deus hypothesis in regards to modern freemasonry. The Rex Deus hypothesis argues that those in the know so to speak in modern freemasonry are direct descendants of the bloodline of Jesus through his brother James, but they make this assertion based simply upon hearsay. I doubt whether many of the claims made in the Second Messiah would hold up in a court of law, although the book does give its readers something to think about."
4,good history,"The book is one of the best when it comes to the history of Freemansonry and the famous Knights Templars. It does give you an excellent detailed account of the fate of the Templars on those fatal nights and what they where accused of. I also liked their account of the Jewish war in 70 AD. The authors argue persuasively that the Rosslyn chappel was built by the Templars and could be housing the invaluable scrolls excavated by the Templars from the Jerusalem temple. The book also covers the mystery of the Turin Shroud. They argue that the image on the Shroud is Jacques de Molay, the last leader of the Templars! Yet, I was NOT convinced by their conclusion that Jacques de Molay was the Second Jesus Christ or Messiah."
2,Interesting,"Seems the author likes to daydream and believes his random collection of information somehow adds up to indisputable proof. Fellow needs to read a bit more on scientific proofs. Other than that, well the book was interesting and entertaining. But should be on the fiction or UFO shelf."
3,Who are the Defenders of the Grail?,"This book confuses the whimsy of LEonardo with reality. There are other books on this subject and most are more revealing. Why have MAsons repudiated this mystical heritage> even GEorge Washington, slaveowner? You would be more stimulated by reading Ken Agori, the Defenders of the Holy Grail.It is TODAY that matters to us!!"
2,"Entertaining, although not really history","While this book is fairly enjoyable as a read, as a piece of historical reporting, it's pretty weak. The authors tend to jump to conclusions based on largely anecdotal information and then treat these conclusions as facts. They're definitely fans of ignoring facts which don't fit their thesis, but then most conspiracy theorists are.Read 'The Monks of War' by Desmond Seward to get a clean, clear historical account of the rise and decline of the Templars, Hospitallers and other military orders. Read this if you like historical conspiracy theories."
1,Shoddy research work,"What could have been quite a good read is spoilt by evidence of shoddy research work. There are several anachronisms which irritate the discerning reader. Examples are the reference to ""the Vatican"" in connection with the Templars' excavations c.1100 (the Pope only moved to the Vatican in 1871), and the setting up of the Hospitaller Order of St John ""of Rhodes and of Malta"" (this Order moved to Rhodes in the fourteenth century and to Malta in the sixteenth). The translation of ""Rex Deus"" is a howler which has already been pointed out by another reader. The vow of obedience taken by the Templars (which aroused the authors' suspicion) is a customary vow taken by all entrants into Roman Catholic religious orders. A cursory query would have shown as much. Otherwise passable."
2,The title is misleading,"It would be nice if Knight and Lomas' supposed findings were true. One would expect then that they would also be more widely reported, especially by the anti-mason press. As they aren't you have to read the book knowing that you're skimming around the edges of conspiracy or what is known as fringe or speculative masonry. I had the distinct impression that the authors were hoping for some masonic recognition and were snubbed, thereby fuelling their conspiracy fire even more.Nevertheless it provides an otherwise enjoyable read and does renew an interest in taking a trip to Rosllyn. However, the title is misleading as the authors try to fashion their 2nd messiah to be like Jesus, forgetting that divinity pays no heed to history, however tenuous the links."
1,Esoteric and Occultic balderdash,"One of the unfortunate aspects of Masonic history is that just about anyone with an opinion can, with the blessings of some publisher, ""discover"" the lost secrets of Masonry, and more often than not, these ""secrets"" lead to an apology for all manner of occultic and theosophical twaddle. The authors of THE HIRAM KEY waste little time getting on to the task of making Freemasonry the implict enemy of the historic, orthodox Christian faith. Fortunately, the Craft has been blessed by the earlier efforts of sound scholarship and research, such as that of Henry Coil, the late John Robinson, and the time honored work of Robert Freke Gould. Anyone interested in learning the REAL history of Freemasonry is encouraged to spend his time with these brothers, and place THE HIRAM KEY where it belongs: in the ""Fantasy and Science Fiction"" section of the library. Aleister Crowley would be most pleased with this book."
1,"Not bad, if it was satire","This book is an essay on the ridiculous connections that can be created when ""it seems reasonable to assume"" and ""it seems likely"" are treated as fact. If it was satire parading as history, I'd have to say it was brilliant. As a historical work, it holds water like a cheese grater.It is pretty entertaining to read if you can get past grinding your teeth over the amazing leaps of presumption."
5,The First Sensible Explanation for the Turin shroud,"This book is the first time I have seen a sensible scientific explanation for the Shroud of Turin. It takes the known facts and fits them together within a logical framework to explain just how the shroud of Turin could have been created, what's more it shows illustrations of similar images created quite naturally by other living object. This plant images from the Science Museeum are not thought of a miricles because they don't look like the western iconic image of Jesus.A really good read, I recommend it for anyone who wants to really understand the Shroud of Turin and its mundane origins."
1,Not believable,"I started to get a bad feeling about this book already on page 8, where the authors cite Hugh Schonfield's off-the-wall book, The Passover Plot, as if it were a standard reference work on early Christianity (they also seem to think it was published in 1993) ... and things go downhill from there.The authors believe that the crucified figure on the Shroud of Turin is not Christ, but (pause for drumroll) Jacques deMolay. The problem here is that while deMolay was certainly martyred by the Inquisition, there's no indication whatever in the historical record that he was crucified. The detailed and gruesome description of this ""event"" is presented as narrative fact, but is actually pure speculation. Bah! If you're looking for a book about goofy theories on the history of Christianity, I recommend Holy Blood, Holy Grail: it's much more readable and sometimes is almost convincing."
2,too many secrets,Cass was Maximos mistress for several years when she decides she wanted more. It was not the plan so they part ways. Six month later she shows up to a wedding with Maximos slimy enemy. My first take of Cass was that she is pathetic and a lunatic to show up just for closure. Maximos had his own secrets too that just keeps unraveling. The dialoge was repetitive in regards to how she should of expect more from him and how she was leaving when she never does..I am partial to books where the heroine has a backbone. At the end the Maximos cries to keep Cass that made it better considering she was the one pleading and crying throughout the book...
1,Missing pieces!,"The throw back arrived with incorrect pieces in the box. The poles were not the correct part and would not go together. There was no way to request replacement parts, can only send it back."
2,NOT A GREAT VALUE,This pitching net wasn't as good as value as I'd expected for the money. First the directions were impossible. Next it came with missing parts. and last..the red center of the net is connected by cheap plastic snaps that kept unsnapping whenever the ball hit it. Also I am still waiting to hear back from the company to see when I will receive the missing parts.Keep shopping folks..but don't stop at this one.
2,crazyhorse,"very cute and roomy. The heels are a cheap light plastic with very slick smooth bottoms... Be careful !!! Appears BASS took a cheap way out with the shoes, a little better heel would had gone a long way As cute as they are can not wear them on anything but carpet."
2,"Looks good, works good, doesn't last long","It looks good, works good, but the plastic corners clips break very easily. Even the company admits it is a problem."
3,I was happy at first.....but not at last,I bought this fire pit 3 years ago and burn on an average of 2 to 3 times a week even through the winter months. Being that hard on a fire pit I figured it would be worth it to invest in a good one so I shelled out the money and it was great until recently. It is literally falling apart. I can no longer use it and feel safe. The legs are disintegrating and so is the bottom. I was truly hoping to not see wear until about 5 years for that price. I only burn seasoned wood in it and have been known to keep a fire going for a couple of days. It was setting on a base of pea gravel and properly covered with the cover provided when raining or sub zero temps hit. With all the rah rah about the Sojoe I just figured it would last a bit longer.
5,Not the cheap sheet metal,"We love this because you know it isn't going to blow away! Be aware that is does have a rustic/rusted look and will leave marks on patio, but for our environment it is great. Well made and won't tip over if you use the foot rail."
4,I could have died laughing,"I was tootaling along in my car listening for the first time to an audio tape of Stuart McLean reading his Stories from the Vinyl Cafe. I almost ran off the road because I was laughing so hard.Every time I hear the story of the jock strap I start to howl all over again. And so it is with so many of his stories.I want to send the tapes to my children and friends and particularly, my enemies. I am sure they will not think so badly of someone who sent them such merriment.[...]"
5,Great Movie,"This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Very well acted, good plot line, simple but not silly. It delves into how easily gambeling can become an obsession and the consequences that result. Fine young cast along with veteran character actor Charles Martin Smith make this a great ensamble movie. Katharine Isabelle is her usual standout and might I add beautiful actress in her role as a graduate student trying to make enough money to finish her degree.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a simple, well acted, ensabmle movie. If you are a Katharine Isabelle fan, this one is a must."
4,"Last Casino, But 4 Stars","I wanted to see this movie because it had Katherine Isabelle in it from the Ginger Snaps trilogy. I think Katherine and Emily Perkins did such a wonderful job in those movies. So, after watching this movie I had to buy it. The characters are all played out very well and there is humor and a little bit of action and suspense in it. You may come to the same conclusion after watching this, like I did. But I think this is the basis for the movie 21, that just recently came out. What do you think?"
4,WWE Fan,"My son is a huge WWE fan, I did not even know who these guys were. He loves them and plays with them all the time."
1,received wrong merchandise,"I wish I could give the proper review....but I ordered 3 wrestler action figures for my Grandsons (rewarding academic achievement)ages 8 & 10. 2 from the same vendor were wrong. Upon complaining was told I would/could be sent a shipping label to send them to the correct customer and they could do the same. I needed the toys to present, also did not feel it was my responsibility to ""ship"" to their customer. It was a VERY disappointing experience. In the future I will go to the stores..!"
1,unhelpful,"I bought this book as it was required for my Masters program. Initially, the book sounded interesting and could prove to be helpful in my daily life at work. However, the book felt as though the author was being paid by the word. While I appreciate examples to help cement an idea, this book has to many. For each bullet the author would provide,there would be no fewer than three examples. If the author cut down the examples to only one or two per bullet, this book would be half as thick.As a professional who has gone back to get a masters degree, I would not recommend this book to an active practitioner, nor would I recommend the book to anyone who is looking to get started. I would recommend the Harvard Business Essentials series for anyone looking for information on how to initiate and manage change."
5,"A refreshing, yet, thought provoking view on change","Being a full time conference interpreter, I've had the inmense fortune of hanging around great thought leaders and change gurus. What DeBrabandere explains in this great work is a reality few have seen before: you need to be re-born twice to really change. He goes on citing many great examples, old and new alike, about what it takes to change. One of the many quotable passages I remember was about bad decisions not being caused by mis-information, but rather by the way our minds function... I'm down to the second reading of the book, and still can't get my eyes off it! Great read, simple, but very profound."
5,Great Book on the Inner Workings of Ads and Copy,I don't have a really in-depth review. Just wanted to say that it's one of the more helpful books I have on the topic of ads and copywriting.
5,the kid's love it...,We bought this and other dvd's for our church's youth program.We have a varied age group that we expose this dvd to and we would highly recommend this to you or your church program.
5,Excellence in a small package,"At first glance, a book of thirty haiku wouldn't seem like serious reading material. But to embrace only the most superficial analysis of the text would be to miss out on a treasure trove of great writing. This is because each haiku is really a succinct vignette of life, each statement a piece of a moment in life, frozen in time. Moreover, every single line of haiku, read aloud, has many extremely different yet concordant meanings, all depending on your intonation, pauses, and pacing. This turns thirty haiku into hours, days, and maybe even years of pondering the subtle meanings every second in time carries. The Haiku in Mr. O'Connor's book capture moments from everyday life, both mundane and exciting, but all captivating and beautiful. And, most importantly, all worth your time."
4,Interesting read -- but defensive of government actions,Delivered on time & as advertised. The content was interesting and presented in an entertaining way. Relates to miners' strike in England. Ian MacGregor was the head of the British coal production company; and he presents the story from his point of view. So he is (somewhat naturally?) defensive of the government's actions. Good reading.
5,Ramones Greatest Hits,This is an excellant compilation that definitely includes all of theair best material. I would totally recomend it to anyone wishing to check out the Ramones for the first time .
5,Classic,"Its a classic disk, and any good collection has to have it. I will bet that it makes you smile when you play it."
4,Love The Ramones,The Ramones are Americas first garage rock band. They were indie before there was indie. They were at their peak when I was a kid and I had a couple of their albums. As I got older I kind of drifted away always planing to tune back into them someday. When I saw this offer and started playing some of the cuts it brought back alot of memories for me. Now to their music. This is an important band that needs to be remembered. Their music holds up even more when compared with all of this auto-tuned pop biased drivel prevelent today.
3,Good enough for this casual Ramones fan,"The Ramones are an acquired taste and in many ways you either love them or you hate them. Ironically however I'm sort of in the middle. There's a lot of their grungier, punkier songs that just don't do it for me but just about every one of their songs that I do like is on this album and I even found a few new ones that I enjoyed. Out of the 20 tracks on the album there's about 8 or 9 that I like and that's enough to justify buying it for me. It's not particularly expensive like some huge Greatest Hits compilations so it really was a painless purchase on my end.I won't pretend to know much about the technical side of things but all the tracks sound fine to me and the CD played well out of the case. That's all the production value I really care about.Good enough for this casual fan. Die hard fans might have a different opinion but if you're like me and there's a handful of Ramone songs you enjoy then chances are they're on this album."
5,Perfect present,"I bought this tee for my 14 year old daughter and she LOVED it. She says all her freinds think it's ""cool"". Fast ship, and product just as described."
1,NOOOOOOOOOOO,"This is horrible. ok, 1. There are already like 3 greatest hits packages and an anthology. There's no need for more. 2. If you are a true Ramones fan(like me), you buy the albums, not greatest hits. Very disapponting."
3,Not Her Best,"This story has an excellent premise and does a good job of illustrating just how helpless a woman really was in terms of rights in the 19th century. However, it is very preachy, most of the characters are two dimensional, and I found myself skipping large portions of the text without feeling I was missing out. (I later went back and re-read it, and discovered my initial impression was correct.) The hero especially is a pale shadow of the irascable yet tender man that Michaels usually writes so well.If you are a Barbara Michaels fan already, you will probably like this book. I am, and I did. However, if you are trying her for the first time, I recommend ""Shattered Silk"" or ""The Wizard's Daughter,"" both of which are superior in terms of writing quality and suspense. I suspect Ms. Michaels was hard at work on her Elizabeth Peters books when she took time out to write this novel."
5,Couldn't Wait To Get To The End,"I buy these books to read on my lunch hour when I'm working, in order to pass the time. I usually don't read at home, because my time is so limited. Greygallows is the first book I've read by Barbara Michaels, and after the first 150 pages, I brought the book home and finished Greygallows that night. I couldn't put it down! Full of suspense!"
4,Not Her Best - But Not Bad,"This was not one of Mrs. Michael's best works, but it still wasn't half bad. I enjoyed it, even though it was a slow read. I found it interesting, but didn't have any trouble putting it down. The ending was very climactic, but after the slow pace set in the previous pages the ending felt way too rushed."
3,"Good author, plodding book","This was my first time reading a book by Barbara Michaels. I thought the basic story was good, however the book read very slowly. I certainly wasn't kept in suspense. The characters really didn't flesh out well until very far into the book, just past the half way through point. Once the seemingly endless process of getting Lucy married off is over and the story focuses on Greygallows, the pace picks up and the plot of the story takes form. I will give the author another try, but wouldn't recommend buying this book. It was just ok, nothing special."
2,Disappointing at best,"I buy these books to read on the beach or on airplanes, so i am not expecting anything other than an entertaining read. Even with these low standards, I found this book derivative and not even a very good copy at that."
3,Vo-Toys is my Dogs favorite toy!,"These are great squeekie toys, they hold up well and my dog doesn't chew them up right away..Haven't been able to find them in stores anymore, and was delighted to find them here! My dog is happy too! Vo-Toys gets 5 stars.UPDATE ON This ITEM!!! The toy I received wasn't made by Vo-Toys...the tag says 'Diggers', and the squeekie part only lasted a few days. It wasn't the same and now doesn't squeek, which was the whole point. The toy itself will probably last a long time, but no squeekie. Only 3 stars for this item."
2,Far Memory Lacks Story,"Although I wanted to like this book, I didn't. There is no central narrative here to tie one anticdote to another, and when something interesting does happen, it is usually described in an off-hand way. Things happen, but the characters (although Joan is really the only one) show no growth."
2,A combination of the mundane and fascinating,"Joan Grant was born into a well-off family and this book describes her childhood and young adulthood mainly in terms of nannies, holidays, parties etc. I didn't feel particularly drawn into the narrative - we rarely get to know the characters she introduces. The discovery of her past lives is of course interesting, so for someone who's already read about them, it's nice to find out who she was. However, as a piece of literature, I don't rate this book very highly (it's nothing like Winged Pharaoh)."
5,A Musical Masterpiece,"This is far the best Focus album. The song ""Anonymous II"" is a musical masterpiece. ""Sylvia"" and ""Answers? Questions! Questions? Answers!"" are also great tracks. I am surprised that they left off the last track again even on the remaster. It's nice to hear this once double album in full without having to get up and keep turning the record over. Especially ""Anonymous II"" which was originally on two different sides of the album."
5,Review,"This book has really helped me increase my knowledge and ability to recognize different kinds of rugs in a dealer's showroom. There are good color photographs, many diagrams about motifs and descriptions of features that rugs from various locales have. I keep going back to the book and re-reading things I didn't pick up before. It is definitely a buyers' guide."
4,Very Helpful Book!,I bought this book a couple of years ago and it has been very helpful in studying the Bible. Easy to use and has the scriptures printed right beside the reference making it easy to look up. It can be used to reinforce the promises of God and help in lifes daily stuations. I would highly recommend this book for anybody that studies the Bible.
2,Not so good,"I gave this CD to a friend of mine and he didn't care for it much at all, he still watches it. I asked how he liked it and he said ""eeh it's ok,"""
2,"Frommer's Santa Fe, Taos and Albuquerque","I found good restaurant reviews but the directions, especially the important High Road to Taos, were very lacking in specifics. Lonely Planet is far better for details like this.Frommer's Santa Fe, Taos and Albuquerque (Frommer's Complete)"
5,Better than Fodor's Guide,"I used this book for almost everything we did in Santa Fe and Taos. It was complete with excellent detail and a wide range of information. I liked it much better than the Foder's Guide, which I barely used."
4,Looking for the best buy?,"Just check the Product Descriptions for the $49.95 Completer Set and the Deluxe Completer Set for $79,95, and you will find that they are exactly the same list of products. So you get nothing extra for the extra $30. Are they crazy???"
2,Canisters Don't Hold Seal,One of my canisters have NEVER held a seal! Poor quality control! What a waste of money!
1,The canisters are junk,Do not buy this the canisters crack after a few weeks of use. They would not honor the warranty because I can't talk and they would only resolve the problem over the phone. That is a violation of Federal law. It's not bad enough I was disabled when I was shot in the face but these jerks are taking advantage of that.
2,fence is nice but rails shipped damaged twice,"The fence is nice, no complaints there. However, twice they shipped me rails that came damaged. At first I blamed UPS but after the second time I figured the problem is how they package the rails. They bolt them together with two tiny bolts in a box that is slightly too loose. By the time it got to my shop the bolts had broken off bending the rail around the holes and stripping them. The first one that was shipped had some pretty serious dents in it despite the fact that its a thick piece of metal. I kept the second one they shipped me but I had to re thread two bolt holes. I would rather have paid more money and not had too fix a brand new tool. I will say Grizzly's customer service was good I just don't have time to ship things back and forth or fix brand new tools."
3,inaccurate,"I agree with other reviewers that the idea is quite nice, but the research has been very sloppy. As a native german speaker, I found that he got about 40% of the German examples wrong. For instance, the word 'scheissbedauern' simply does not exist in German -- as one might verify by picking up any German-English dictionary. (Upon googling, one finds that this word has appeared in the literature -- but only in the American literature.) Hopefully, some later edition of the book will fix these kind of problems."
2,Overrated,"As a native speaker of one of the less familiar languages mentioned in the book, I found the glosses to be oversimpilified at best and completely wrong at worst. It seems the author wanted to make a point and to do so, resorted to making the facts fit the explanation. Since the facts of one language have been distorted in this fashion, how is one to know that the facts of languages one has no knowledge of have been similarly distorted?Reading about languages and their peculiarities is fun, but if the facts are not accurate, then the whole book is quite suspect. I do not recommend the book, unless you want to see how your language has been distorted."
3,"Not bad, bad far from good","After all those reviews from native speakers of different languages, I felt I had to give my two cents in.As a native speaker of Croatian/Serbian/Bosnian, I must correct the author on two occasions, and that is a lot of corrections, since he did not use many words from these languages.First of all, ""trg"" does not mean ""market"" as he wrote, but ""square"". Perhaps what confused him was the word ""trznica"", which indeed means market, and has its roots in the word ""trg"", but nevertheless.And second, ""zrtva"" is not ""winegar""! Far from it, the word means ""victim"", while ""vinegar"" is ""ocat"" in Croatian ""sirce"" in Serbian.That was a serious miss."
5,A Gentle Reminder,"This book didn't impart any great wisdom, nor did it give me the answer to the mystery of life. However, it provided -- in one gloriously illustrated and simply written volume -- a gentle reminder for how I want to live my life: gracious, mindful, natural and simple.I was already familiar with much of the material, but it was nice to be reminded of it... how to eat ""properly,"" basic yoga poses, practical advice for communication and relationships, beauty from the kitchen, facials, steams, pedicures, home crafts... there was even a section on how to save you sanity by deletating chores in your house -- and a bit of very useful advice on how to get your spouse to contribute his fair share.I keep this book on my coffee table and page through it when I'm feeling depressed or stressed out. It never fails to remind me of how simple it is to attain happiness."
4,not bad,"Berserker is one of the better science fiction novels that I've read in recent years. It deals with a futuristic war between humans and gigantic starships named berserkers, whose orgins are not revealed in this volume. While the plot may sound like a cliche, the writing is crisp and original.The best part of the novel is the lengthy chapter in the middle that covers the climactic battle between humanity and the berserkers. It's a scene of high suspense and excellent descriptions of the action. Afterwards, there are several chapters pertaining to other incidents that are only loosely connected to the main storyline. These chapters aren't quite as entertaining, and some of them are downright silly. It would have been nice if the author had stuck to just one single plotline. Even so, the overall book is highly original and well worth reading."
3,Juanita Brown ...the story of a talented actress.,"Juanita Brown was a very good actress in the 70's exploitation realm and it is too bad that this movie is the ONLY chance she got to act beyond the usual supporting roles she was casted at that time.......don't get me wrong....the movie is not that bad (for b-movies standards of course), but I still think that her best role is the portrayal of the troubled mom-turned-prostitute Claudia in the most touching scene of FOXY BROWN........that scene alone shows that with slightly better productions values and with the support of a good director (like Jack Hill surely is) that actress could had much more to say than the handful of b-movies she been part of in the first half of the 70'sif anyone has more info on her please share with us as well"
3,Yum but ouch,"I love chewing on these things. Like, really chewing. Gnawing them to bits. I'm using them to cut back on my gum-chewing, because I go crazy without something to chew on all day.The cinnamon flavor is pretty strong. I've found that it even burns my lips a little sometimes, so I try to put on chapstick before popping a tea tree stick in my mouth. My only complaint is that these seem to splinter very quickly, much more so than the Preserve brand. If you're a gnawer like I am, you might find yourself with unpleasant splinters and wood bits floating around in your mouth. Be careful! I do really love the flavor, but when I run out I might try a different brand to see if I can avoid the splintering problem."
1,WAY too strong for me and I'm no tender foot with flavors.,"I wanted to love these. I read how great these can be as chewing sticks. I am cinnamon addicted so I thought it would be perfect. Wahooa, are they strong! Toooo much tea tree. If you know tea tree at all it has a smell of road tar. Very good for being an anti bacterial but this is too much. The cinnamon tries to drown it out but doesn't. I find it burns my mouth. I try to get some of the flavor sucked off slowly but you can't really leave it in your mouth until some of the flavor has died down some. It really isn't worth the effort of the burn and bad taste."
3,So so,When I first got these the flavor was great. However the plastic holder they come in will not stay closed and pops open constantly. This has caused the sticks to loose some of the flavor to them. It is a real shame as they had such great flavor in the beginning and was a nice size to carry in my truck.
1,Trite and Superficial,"I was unpleasantly surpised to be disappointed by this book. I found it to be superficial, trite, and too reductive. There are a lot of better management books out there, even one much better one about pretty much the same subject."
3,Tony's Coattails Show Some Wear,"A great idea: get an immediately recognizable character in memorable situations to illustrate leadership principles.Where does it break down? When you have to stretch to place thoughts into the fictional character's head that might not be there. When you have to overlook inconsistencies and deviations from your theory in use. When you have to apply cute language to charm the reader into ignoring a terrible truth: you're saying the same old stuff with new language.Tony studied Sun-Tzu - you should do the same...if your opponent is choleric, irritate him."
5,What an Interesting book!!!!,"What a fresh approach to leadership! It uses a fictional character and real examples from real companies to illustrate the points. I was impressed by the wealth of knowledge of the show, as well as ledership theory and practice. The author has, indead, done her homework!While some of the points of the show may be made with a wink, the applications are real. I walked away with at least 5 points I can put into action tomorrow. Thanks---Lyn Ginsburg."
5,Leadership Book of the Century?,"Is this the best leadership book out there? I think so. Let me tell you why! It is original. It takes the actions of a character from popular fiction and draws leadership lessons we can all use to improve our skills. This is not just for CEO's--even though some have endorsed it--it is for everyone. Yes---IT does not discriminate! Deborrah Himsel draws on a wide range of experience, humor, espertise, and good old 'horse sense' to apply these lessons. She doesn't discriminate. She thinks we can ALL learn these leadership lessons. So do I!"
1,contrived and kinda dull,"I bought this book thinking it would be a fun, satirical look at business, with a few useful pieces of advice thrown in. Kinda like Dilbert. What I got instead was a dry recitation of generic management advice written by an Avon lady (really). The references to Tony Soprano are completely contrived, and embarrassingly serious. They made me want to yell, ""Hey, he's a fictitious character, created by a roomful of Hollywood writers!"" If this book were written 30 years ago, it would be called Leadership Captain Kirk Style. It's a prime example of borrowed interest, and should wind up on remainders tables in about three years."
1,Italian-American Bashing,"Stop the stereotypes of Italian-Americans! This book relies heavily on the same images as 'that show'---big-bellied guys from Jersey who whack people who disagree with them. I don't know how anyone can read this stuff and take it seriously. There are so many lessons to be learned from great Italian-Americans who are law-abiding! What about many the firefighters and cops in the WTC? We should be holding them up as examples of heros, not this guy!"
3,There is a much better book,"This book has some old hack ideas and stereotypes. If you want to read a very interesting book about Italians and Italian Americans, read ""The Golden Milestone: Over 2500 Years of Italian Contributions to Civilization."""
5,Well crafted and informative!,"I thought this was a great book! It was well written, structured to facilitate understanding, and chocked with ways to apply what I learned along the way. As a fledgling manager, I know I have a lot to learn. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see how easy it was to apply the principles Ms. Himsel set forth. It was also good to know that she had used them successfully with her people. Much more real than theory. Thanks much!"
5,horslips at their best!,"This album is Horslips' most electric and hardest rocking album. Johnny Fean's guitar work is fast and tight. The songs are all great and performed almost flawlessly. This album is as good as a live album gets, the live versions of the songs on this album are played better and have much more emotion and energy than they do on their respective studio albums. ""The Belfast Gigs"" is a much better example of Horslips live than the ""Horslips Live"" album. If you were to own one live Horslips album, this should be it. As a matter of fact, if you were to own only one Horslips album, this should be it."
4,Horslips - The Belfast Gigs- original CD release on Outlet/Homespun records.,"Horslips - The Belfast Gigs- original CD release on Outlet/Homespun records.Tracks are:1. Trouble With a Capital T2. The Man Who Built America3. Warm Sweet Breath of Love4. The Power and the Glory5. Blindman6. Shakin' All Over7. King of the Fairies8. Guests of the Nation9. Dearg DoomThis is the original and out of print older release of this album on CD. A nice collectible piece for the Horslips fan that has everything, but for a first time fan I recommend picking up the newer remaster on Demon records which was released under direct supervision by the band after they reacquired their back catalog."
2,The emperor`s not wearing any clothes...,"I am au fait with all of this band`s albums and I can assure anyone unfamiliar with Horslips that, as an earlier reviewer stated, the studio versions of these tracks are far superior to the live versions on either the double album ""Horslips Live""(from 1975) or on this later effort, ""The Belfast Gigs""(their final album, released in 1980)which, although better than the earlier live album, which was appallingly bad, fails to do justice to any of the tracks and makes up with noise and improvised sloppiness what it lacks in substance and musical dexterity.I never saw these guys play live but I suspect that there was more than a little truth behind a contemporaneous music critic`s claim that ""Horslips couldn`t really play...""The fans who rave about ""The Belfast Gigs"" are those fans who think that Horslips could do no wrong and are therefore not prepared to be objective and realistic about how good, bad, or indifferent Horslips really were, at different times."
3,Go for the 2-CD version!,"Consumer Alert - the Razor & Tie label put this title out twice; there are two versions. The earlier, 2-disc version is the one mastered by renowned engineer Steve Hoffman, and that's the one you want to look for. The front covers are identical, but the back cover clearly lists either the song selection you see above, or listings for 2 discs worth of 70's oldies. There is a sound quality difference."
2,Why was this redone?,"I have the earlier two disc set, which is awesome. And everytime I rip it, this one comes up and names the songs wrong! I can't believe they've redone this CD and left out some of the best songs. Ok, I don't miss King Tut but Seasons in the Sun and Walk on the the Wild Side and Miracles, shoulda left it alone. Maybe you can find the old two disc set used, but I'm not parting with mine!"
4,A moving and tender novel,"This is a incrediblebook. The images she creates through her words are not just heartbreakingly beautiful but the anguish of love is something we can all relate to. It's all consuming nature is well explored here with the story gradually proceeding through this woman's life and the effects this one man has had on her. A definite must read, especially if you liked ""Like Water For Chocolate""."
3,I was not impressed,"I don't think this book is that incredible. It starts off interesting, but the end is wrapped up much too neatly. Also, I don't think the focus of this book is the love affair between the two main characters, as some reviewers have said. I think it is more about the narrator's exploration of herself. I like reading Sandra Ciseneros or Cherrie Moraga much better."
4,Be prepared,"This is absolutely one of the most grotesque movies you'll see. I can handle a lot, but had to turn away many times. No it's not the highest quality film, but that's not what it's supposed to be I imagine. Take it at face value. I tend to like twisted movies and this certainly fit the bill. I did enjoy it overall and am glad I bought it."
4,Oh...wait....don't....stop,"This movie made me want to stop it and take a shower on more than one occasion. Keep in mind, I'm a Clive Barker and Scott Sigler fan, so the truly violent and grotesque is what I eat for breakfast. This movie? This movie put them all to shame. It made the first Human Centipede seem like child's play. I was physically ill and my sense of common human decency was attacked on every level. The mindless brutality, the profane indifference to human suffering, and the utter lack of a fracking point to it all was offensive and intriguing all at the same time.This movie should be watched as a challenge between friends. Who can watch it the longest without demanding that it be turned off. Be warned, the friend of yours that's grinning like an idiot at the end of the movie should be shunned."
3,Gore filled!,"For those complaining about the first one not having enough, watch this one! This was just so distasteful. It was a good movie if you plan on being a stalker/killer. The ending has many questions to it, but I guess we will find out in the third movie. As they say for the sickest movie ever, for me yes, but I doubt that it is the sickest ever."
1,Worst movie,Every scene was wild. From doing his business with sand paper to his mom stabbing his bed. Worst movie i have ever seen. Period.
1,The poster,"I watched because I was totally confused by the poster that was released. Poster apparently was another movie LOL. Same ole, same ole as last movie, a couple more gross scenes but not worth the money."
3,Definitely for certaIn tastes only,"I purchased this (along with The Human Centipede) at the recommendation of a friend. While he was very enthusiastic about both movies, I found them to move along somewhat predictably and slow."
2,Serious Disappoinment,"We purchased this movie with great anticipation after seeing the first installment. Let me start off by asking the question WHY BLACK AND WHITE?...In my opinion this really detracts from the enjoyment of the graphic nature of the flick, which was supposedly its calling card. This movie has no coherent plot and almost zero dialog from the actors. The main character does not say a word almost throughout the entire movie. This flick exists for the sole purpose of gore and it does not even do that right. Save your money."
3,my point of view on this sick movie.....,"The human centipede 2 is the sickest movie I've ever seen...... If you're into sadistic crap, you'll be into this... The ONLY reason I rated it 3 outta 5 is because I like the human centipede 1, atleast the doctor knew what he was doing lol"
1,One of the most POINTLESS movie ever made,"Having seen the 1st movie, I wasnt sure what they could do in this one...this one was made to be a nauseating excursion and it succeeds...it was pointless and so over the top, I see why it was black and white..nobody could stomach it otherwise. Its a movie that served no purpose in being made and all it was made for was to see how truly gross they could get."
1,"""And then there were twelve...""","Whereas the original HUMAN CENTIPEDE had a mere three unfortunates joined together at their rectums, this smash sequel ups the ante -- or is that centi-ante? -- by nine for an even dozen and succeeds in making an ass out of everyone involved, most of all the ""filmmakers."""
3,Film was good but doesnt beet the first one,"The Human Centipede 2 which is about a mentally retarded man who doesnt speak and gets abused by pratically everyone he knows is obsessed with ""The Humans Centipede."" He is obsessed with the idea and the stars themselves calling there manager and telling them a director wants them for a film. Even though he doesnt talk. The movie is in black and white. Not even ten minutes into the movie the man shoots someone and hits them. This movie had it all The mans mother hates him and tries to kill him. His therapists wants to do him. A mother just had a kid and smashed the newborn face in. This movie is good but not as the first"
1,worst movie ever,Let me just say the first movie is a classic. This movie is a massive come down from the first. Has an unbelievable plot with an unbelievable character. Let me warn you this movie is morbid gross and uncomfortable. I like sick movies but this one is just perverse and disturbing. Definitely the worst sequel ever. This movie will make you feel uncomfortable. Its to bad Tom Six had ruin a good thing with this idiotic no intellect piece of crap movie. Horrible!!
1,Disgusting!,If you want to watch a movie about people getting their faces stapled to another persons rear end and feces flying at the wall.. You have major problems. This is the most disgusting movie I have ever seen! It makes the first one look like its rated PG. watch at your own risk and keep a barf bag handy!!!!!
3,Not as good but not a complete let down.,I would have enjoyed it better if it didn't show so much of the sweaty villain. I was not a huge fan of the way they did his character or focused so much on close up shots of him. Aside from that element (which was most of the movie) I think there could have been a really good and creepy movie. The main guy really ruined it.
4,Crazy movie I wish it was not b&w :(,"Very strange, crazy entertaining movie. Would of gave 5 stars if movie was in color. Definitely twisted and parts were comical even."
4,Wow!,This is the sickest movie I watched so far this year. Would have got a 5 star instead of 4 from myself if it was in color. Starts out boring but by the middle it is good and last half hour is brutal. Another great IFC to add to my collection.
1,You will be on a government list,"I like moves (sometimes) JUST for their depravity. Not this one. The sequel was originally banned in the UK. From the report about the first movie, ""Although the concept of the film was undoubtedly tasteless and disgusting, it was a relatively traditional and conventional horror film and the Board concluded that it was not in breach of our Guidelines at `18'."" About the second, ""The explicit presentation of the central character's obsessive sexually violent fantasies is in breach of Classification Guidelines and poses a real, as opposed to a fanciful, risk that harm is likely to be caused to potential viewers."" I concur.I would say that if you watch this movie you should be put on a government list, except I just watched it myself. Maybe if you watch it twice. Definitely if you watch it twice, you deserve to be put on a list."
2,dumb movie,"i thought this movie was going to be super scarey. i was really disappointed.there was one part that made me cringe, but thats it. the first movie installment was better."
2,Disappointed,Well after watching this I am very dissappointed in the lack of story and acting. I loved the first one it creepied me out and showed a few gross things that helped tell the story. This one just threw tons of gross things in and it looked like all they wanted to do is make you sick. If it would have been in color then maybe it would have made me sick but in black and white everything looked gray and not gross.
4,If you like gross here it is !,"Perfectly cast mad ""doctor"" is an overweight psycho whose fetishes break all barriers. Not to be seen as a ""first date"" movie. Think you have seen it all? This movie makes ""Night of the Living Dead"" look like a smurf movie."
3,Feeling mighy unclean now...,"Okay, I was properly warned... advised... notified in advance, or whatever... ""The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence"" was disgusting. I have learned to appreciate horror films for what they are and for the message they are trying to convey. HC2 had no real message, however; it was just another bloody romp. YET... I still kind of liked it. Is there something wrong with me?!?"
1,not worth watching,I saw this on Netflix and watched it with my eyes closed during the graphic scenes. It was sick and disturbing. I will not watch it again. It's a goood thing it was in black & white. It was worse than the first film.
3,Disturbing and utterly disgusting.,"This movie was painful to watch at times. The gore is taken to a new high in this sequel. The disturbing concept of this movie is how you can see when loners take things to far from what they've watched in the movies and try to recreate those events in real life. This movie entails rape, torture, and mutiliation. Enough said."
2,Not as good as the first sequence,"""The Human Centipede"" sequence one was by far one of the more disturbing and horrific movies I have ever witnessed [or likewise will for that matter] and I can see why it one a slew of awards back in 2009. Excellent, but very grotesque film. I think it is hard to top any original movie with a sequel. Sequence two for me did not live up to sequence one. It was just as graphic as the first, but to me the second seemed dragged out and the story line just was not there. I am interested to see how Tom Six pulls how off the third installment [or better yet where it's filmed]....maybe here in the US?"
1,"If I could give it a -5 stars, I would...","This will no doubt be the most disgusting, disturbing, repulsive movie I will EVER watch in my entire life. Out of all the movies I have watched in my 23 years on this earth I can honestly say that I have never been as disgusted as I was while watching this particular movie. Whoever wrote this can't be all there mentally. Something has to be wrong with them. I watched this movie on Netflix, which means I viewed it for free. However, I still feel robbed. Bottom line is... IT SUCKED!"
2,shocking gore,"there wasn't much of a story, just gore. i don't recommend this to anyone unless they are ok with gore. i can tolerate it. not my favorite."
3,Human centipede 2: Full Sequence,Im a huge fan of Human centipede. I went to Texas Frightmare(aka a horror convention)last year and got to meet Dieter Laser. So I was super excited when they were making another.But this fails in comparison to me. The effects were great and it was creepy but there were just plain boring parts.
2,Don't believe the hype!,"When I first saw the first film I was indeed shocked. Great acting and seriously twisted villain. Very disturbing and sickening images. Loved it! Now seeing the second I am very disappointed. People calling it the most grotesque film ever made haven't seen enough gross out films. Sure it has moments and it is twisted but much more boring than the original. Zero character development. I am sure that was the direction Tom Six wanted to go but it didn't work for me. And the whole black and white thing? An artistic statement? Why??? I like my blood red! On a shock scale this rates way beneath Cannibal Holocaust. See it because you have to, but don't believe the hype!"
1,Barf Barf Barf,Horrible. This movie was a waste of time and money. Absolutely disgusting!!! There were several parts in the film that I actually had to fast-forward through because they were so gross. Don't waste your time.
3,It's ok,The first one was better. This one is just as gory. I don't think this story made that much sense.
2,seen one seen 'em all,the shock factor and potty humor is what made the original so memorable. Adding parties to the centipede does not make a better sequel. Very disappointing. This is something even netflix should be able to provide their streaming customers; if they still have any. See the original and don't bother with the part 2. I barely chuckled at the potty humor in this one.
5,"an original dark ""cartoon""",funny but not to be taken more seriously. if you hate shock sequences don't watch it. this is the uncut version
5,I love this dvd!,"I really love this dvd. It's definitely one of my favorites. Easy to follow and love the music, feels like I am at the club! Ariellah is beautiful. I highly recommend this."
5,Awsome,Awsome Awsome Awsome.Great amount of Yoga and bellydance moves are broken down so well.And her performances are beautiful to watch.
3,Less than Expected,"I got this based on the unusually high number of rave reviews.The yoga section is too long and slow (for me), but it is relaxing. The workout doesn't move along at quite the pace I like. But definitely read a lot of reviews: it could just be my preferences."
3,Still Not Integrated,"Comparing this DVD to Rachel Brice's yoga/belly dance combination, I have to say that Ariellah tries to INTEGRATE yoga and belly dance, but with limited success. If I'm going to practice with a tape, I'd rather go with Brice's separate drills until someone comes up with a workout that combines the two elements better than Ariellah does."
3,contemporary bellydance by ariellah,"I was pretty dissapointed with this dvd, actually. It's pretty boring. I can barely get through about 15 minutes before i have to stop watching- her voice is boring, and I expected her to have a lot more energy on this one. I gave it three stars because there is a lot of drilling and yoga, though I don't really like the yoga sets myself. Over all, I would not buy this one."
2,Disappointing,I'm not clear why this video got so many 5 star reviews. I have been a yoga practitioner for many years and Ariellah's style of yoga is really just not very good. The belly dancing doesn't really make up for it.
5,wonderful,"I love this video. Her tribal bellydancing is beautiful and very inspiring, I find that if I need help getting into ""bellydancing mode"" watching her choreography gives me the inspiration to keep going.Her drills are very tiring, but very beneficial, she constantly reminds you about your posture which is very good for a beginner.The music isn't distracting and neither is her voice.I absolutely love this DVD and it will be one that I will continue to use in the future."
5,Suprisingly good,"I had been interested in doing tribal belly dance for a long while. I bought this video, about a month ago, after looking at the reviews and the video trailer on youtube. I suggest you check that out if you're interested in buying. I love her style and she is a great teacher. I've purchased a few other belly dance videos that haven't inspired me or taught me a thing. This makes me want to purchase more and eventually perform!The music is a little silly at times (the Gregorian chant to techno beat made me laugh a little), but it's all very palatable if you're open minded.At first it's all very hard. You're going to be burning in your legs and arms, and your body's not going to want to bend in certain ways. After a month of just drilling the first set, I find myself able to do everything so far and come as close to fluid movements as possible. The second set of drills is alittle more intense. Take this video one step at a time and you'll love it!"
3,It's ok if you like gothic/contemporary bellydance,"I was a little disappointed in the dvd because I thought the title was misleading. The title needs to include ""gothic"" in it so customers don't get something they aren't looking for. Her performance dances are set to music that I didn't particularly like. I totally agree with her that yoga can only enhance a person's bellydance experience. She is an awesome bellydancer but I personally don't like the gothic style. I guess I learned that if it says contemporary rather than traditional, it may need more scrutinizing before I buy it."
5,My Bible for every trip to NYC,The 'List by Item' at the front of the store and restaurant chapters is invaluable. The boxed tidbits make this guide book easier and more enjoyable to read. With the changing of NYC the author's suggestion of calling a business before a visit sure makes sense.
1,this is awful,"This is well written, but he plays favorites. I went to Village a place that he said was awful and it was the best meal I have ever had in a long time. It was well priced too. So my conclusion is that he should go there again with an open mind and enjoy!"
3,Overrated,"We bought an early edition of this book, and have found it wanting. Yes, there were some good shopping recommendations. But the ratings for restaurants and many other points of interest are just not that good.The newer editions are also poor, given their inclusion of establishments long since closed, or destroyed by terrorists.The Blue Guide to New York is a much better bet, for my money."
5,"A Complete, but General Introduction","One thing I really like about this book is that each section starts off with a little introduction that gives some background on that section. Things like how and why it came about, what it is supposed to be doing. A lot of books start out with something like: To Install GNOME.... This one starts out: GNOME is.... And it gives you a web site where you can go get the latest version. Sure GNOME is on the CD included with the book, but versions change frequently in the open source community and if what's on the CD does happen to be the latest version, it won't be for long.The other good point about this book is that it is a complete reference. In one book it covers the whole system. This means that it cannot go into as much depth as a dedicated book, but here is at least a start on everything that you're likely to need to know. And if it isn't here, there are references as to where to go get things."
4,SLASH!!!!,"Wakeboarding at its best. Byerly doesnt impress like i hoped he would. Considering this is a hyperlite video and scott is hyperlites signature rider and probably the best in the sport today. The rest of the riding is spectacular, especially the wakeskating. The filming is also very good."
1,This DVD has a TRT of 16:12,"Yes, that's right. Despite Universal's desperate and shameless marketing attempt to make this package appear somehow extensive or definitive, they were still unable to get around the fact that, no matter how you slice it, Smashmouth only has about 16 minutes and 12 seconds of presentable material. And, frankly, I think they stretched it pretty thin."
4,"For What I Paid, I Can't Really Complain.","You Get Five Videos, All Star, Walkin' On The Sun, Why Can't We Be Friends, Then The Morning Comes And Pacific Coast Party. Yeah, Know That's Not Alot, But I Only Paid 4 Dollars Total, So I'm Not Gonna Sit Back And Bitch About It, Plus This Is The Only Smash Mouth Dvd Ever Relased. Just Buy It As Long As Your Not Over Paying For It."
2,"Barely good, but interesting enough","Well theres alot of good reveiws for this book.a few things I didn't like about Paragon Lost:-Beau is more than slightly unbelievable in his planning of ALL the events of the Novel. He seems to be in control of almost every event that comes his way.-The moral laws of Duncans laws are quite pathetic and absolutly unrealistic. He seems to imply that sexual relationships shoud never be questioned, and if questioned, it is wrong to do so, which does not add up to reality as every sexual relationship has in itself a consequence involving not just the participants but all those arround them.-The magic is a wee bit too easy, unexplained and quite boringwhat is commendable:-Intersting political intrigue.-Some very memorable characters-Great swordplay"
5,One very very good book.,"I have been a fan of The King's Blades series since it's start. The characters are very real, and the plots are a few notches above the plots in most of the fantasy books on the market. In fact I would say that the plots are better than just about any book out there. The wind and turn and keep you guessing.And this book sets itself apart from the others in the series with the creation of a truly likeable hero. The kind that makes you cheer outloud. Sir Beaumont, the best swordsman in the world. And yet, he never resorts to the sword but his cleverness and, yes, more guts than any human being has any right to have. This is fantasy after all. The type of guy to walk right into a trap the villains have set. And make it work against them. And above all, a man of his word. What more could you ask for?"
3,The Ending?,I plowed through Bambara's huge book on the subject of the Atlanta child murders - and I stuck with it out of a loyalty to two of my favorite writers: Bambara and Toni Morrison. It was beautifully written in parts and very tedious in others. My question is this: what happens at the end? I don't get it. Whose voice does Zala hear inside that causes her to rush into Gitten's house. I really have puzzled over this. Clues?
4,Hocus Pocus,"Progressive rock. How else could we describe rock songs that still sound futuristic so many decades after their release?I initially wanted to write a review about the whole of this album, but it seems I can't. Whenever I want to listen to it, I just get stuck on ""Hocus Pocus"". What an unbelievable song! Rock music has never since produced a more exciting, self-confident, timeless representative of the kind. The word ""masterpiece"" is used too often by too many people to describe too many songs. But if I was to use it just for one rock song, ""Hocus Pocus"" would be the one.Focus is not my favorite band, and I 'm trying to be as objective as possible, through my puny English skills. But this song! Oh, this song..."
5,Where's the Focus box set???,"Ok, there is a box set for every group on the planet except for Focus. I grew up listening to Jan Akkerman play burning, completely original guitar. Their music was melodic, innovative, moving, interesting and without fad or trying to appeal to a younger audience. I would love to see a comprehensive cd box set of all the albums plus some unreleased material. That being said, i'm sure there are many others who feel the same way. Paying $35.00 for each import cd is a rip!."
3,Don't need anything else.,"If you know of Focus, and are just a casual fan, then this is all you need. They definitely have more depth than just ""Hocus Pocus"" but in reality this is a good overview of their career."
3,Delivery Issue,"The product was fine, but I was disappointed in the amount of time it took for delivery. I received the item only after being contacted by Amazon informing me that the item had not shipped and I needed to contact the vendor directly. It shipped the day after I sent them an e-mail."
3,"Bueno, pero solo eso...","La primer vez que escuché este grupo fue en vivo, cuando se presentaron por primera vez en la ciudad de Valparaíso, Chile, en Octubre del 2002. La verdad es que fue un concierto espectacular, realmente quedé sorprendido por el virtuosismo y la creatividad de los temas (dos caracteristicas dificiles de encontrar en un grupo). Desde ese día comencé a conseguirme algunos temas, y no me defraudaron: temas espectaculares en que la conjunción de los instrumentos relamente impresiona: especialmente la combinación flauta - guitarra.Al escuchar este disco esperaba encontrar aquellos temas en que se mostraba la creatividad y el virtuosismo, pero al parecer seleccionaron los temas más comerciales y digeribles, y no es en ese plano en donde la banda se destaca por completo. De todas maneras se cumplió el objetivo de un disco de grandes exitos: te gusta porque es bueno, pero te das cuenta que lo mejor esta en los discos originales..."
3,Hocus Pocus by Focus,"A first hearing, Hocus Pocus is not a regular ""rock and roll"" song. Possibly a precursor to groups like Queen. Unlike Queen, Focus is a one trick pony. Every song on the album is a theme on the one track. That's it, Focus is a one ""track"" pony. Find Hocus Pocus on a various artists album and don't bother with this album The recording quality is a masterpiece of LP or analog tape hiss. After the second cut, it becomes irritating. If you like rock with a cerebral flavor, go for Queen or Yes,or King Crimson but don't bother with Hocus Pocus by Focus"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"This has never appealed, I can never quite pin down why, and recently having delved into Fiends of the Eastern Front again, I have nothing against tank battles, or anything like that, in general, whether in prose or graphic novel form. Just one of those things, I guess."
3,Not too bad.,"Overall, The Return is an okay Bonanza to have. It's about a murderer, who claims to have shot someone's son is a fair fight, who returns to Virginia City to get settled. Nobody cares for him nor likes him. But the Cartrights hire him and try to help him out. Then he tries to run away with a girl he loves, the man who's son got shot's daughter. How bad is that? But it has a very surprising ending. So if you really wanna see a great Bonanza, I suggest trying to find The Flapjack Contest, Woman of Fire, Springtime, The Smiler, or The Wooing of Abigail Jones."
3,It was a good family movie,It was a good family movie. I liked it though it is not the future I would foresee for the Cartwrights.
5,McKeown's Price Guide To Antique And Classic Cameras.,"Much better than we expected. The best camera price guide we have seen. It is complete, well presented, easy to use. Well worth the money."
4,woods ball,i would give it a 5 star but the only bad thing is. Its hard to keep in good shap and im all about making all my things look nice and new.. but the plus is its compact and hold the bigger HPA tanks! and 2 full size pods
3,"decent harness, belt sucks","The belt is thin compared to others and slots through a much wider hole. If the belt was as wide as the hole, and made of a sturdier fabric it would work much better. I wouldn't recommend this, get one with a wide velcro band instead."
4,decent,"This harness fits well on your thigh. The belt could be a little better, it tends to slips a bit, but overall a nice product."
2,Not my cup of tea,"The main problem I have is that three of the nine files are damaged, and have glitches during playback. I re-downloaded the files but they are the same. I am not sure how to go about getting this fixed.That said, I am not a big fan of the music either. I was curious to hear these concerti in full, as I am familiar with a rather cacaphonous rendition of the Toccata movement of No. 1 by Emerson, Lake and Palmer. I thought that the original version played by piano and orchestra would have to sound more melodious (it doesn't). I am not a real fan of the ""postmodern"" classical music style which disdains melody and structure, and strives to assault the ears. It is always a bad sign when you can't tell whether the orchestra is still practicing and tuning up, or whether they have begun to play the composition."
3,Mairin,"Saw her live when I was in Ireland. She's great, very talented, as is her sister who appeared with her. But I would have liked more jigs and Riverdance type of music."
2,use the shaker instead,"a cool idea for someone who likes to try new things in the kitchen. Bought this item for a gift. The grater came with rust on it, and the packaging was all scratched up so you couldn't even read the description of the salt. Amazon sent me another one and the 2nd package was just as bad as the first. Needless to say, I repackage the salt and had to buy a new grater."
1,hard to use,I found this very hard to use. The grater is sharp and therefore grates your knuckles when it slips from your grip because you have to push the salt so hard into the grater. You also have to grate A LOT of salt to get enough to taste.
5,Ready to go,"After reading this book I am inspired to make my own journey. Just me, my bike, and no place to go in particular. Beautiful writing."
1,guilty liberal goes on a ride,"It doesn't take very long to realize you are reading a book by a Republican hating lib. The author drones on about the bad rv people, snobbish and drunk males, and really captures our interest by describing every granola bar and cup of tea she has on her ""journey""....the trip itself is suspect as there are many descriptions that don't jibe with reality. All in all, this is a quick read, one that you will put away and wonder why you wasted good riding time reading this dribble."
5,Tidy and Attractive!,"Very nice large Hebrew ""letters"", with the correct English word right under it. Fantastic learning tool for me, who am teaching myself the language. Neat and tidy volume, very attractive, about the size of the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer."
4,Ballhawk,"Christopher has produced an early reader for children to begin reading chapter books (something they are usually very excited about). This one centers on a 9-year old boy trying to become a great hitter to win his father's love. The whole time he doesn't realize that he is an excellent outfielder and his father would love him anyway. A touching story and quick read.Vocabulary is kept basic, and chapters are kept short. However, the amount of baseball knowledge and terminology is incredible. This book may appeal to many children due to the topic, but if they are not prepared for the explanations of baseball plays, they will lose interest.Why 4 stars?:This book was well constructed as far as vocabulary and chapter length to be a beginning chapter book. However, I had to take off one star due to the amount of baseball vernacular that is used and may not be understood by all children. It gets very heavy."
1,Literally pocket-sized,"Despite my one-star, there is nothing wrong with this as far as it goes. But it doesn't go very far.The first page spells out that it is intended as a convenient reference to slip into your calculator case and not as a replacedment for your handbook (which is what I wanted as my hanbook is lost).The booklet seems very straightforward and does not purport to be anything but what it is. All very well once you can see it.I don't think it is worth the cost."
3,"Wonderful Vocals, BUT","BUT why the fake audience applause? This CD is a collection of some of Mario's Coca Cola Show songs. That program was recorded without an audience and had added canned applause. The same sounding fake applause after every song is very distracting and takes away from complete enjoyment for me. In my opinion the English companies addition of the canned sound seriously detracted from this CD's quality. Of course, nothing could ever take away Mario's wonderful sound that I still enjoy in spite of the dumb applause. I have a large collection of Lanza's music that I've purchased from Amazon and continue to be thrilled that I have access to a wide selection of his music and DVDs from them. Without the annoying applause this would be a five star CD."
3,Not Worth While,"This book has a cool premise - but it fell pretty flat. I personally liked the way `Witch Child' ended. This book introduces Mary's descendant, Agnes, a modern-day college student. Instead of getting to know Agnes at all, we're pretty much stuck in flash-backs Agnes has of Mary. In these flash-backs, the great life Mary seems to have a chance of at the end of `Witch Child' unravels. It seemed like most of this book was just thrown together to make a sequel. It wasn't that gripping and it didn't make you care much about the characters, especially the new ones."
2,A so-so sequel...,"This is the follow-up to ""Witch Child"", exploring what happened to Mary after we left her. I almost think it would have been better if the author had left the story of Mary open-ended then tried to connect it to Agnes, a modern-day Native American girl who has visions of Mary's life. The book jumps around a lot, often leaving whole chunks of time unexplained. It also was a bit annoying switching back and forth between Mary and Agnes. I did find parts of the book focusing on traditional Native American life interesting though."
2,It was ok I guess,"This was a huge disapointment after Witch Child. First of all, I did not like the way the story was broken up, I always wished I was reading a different part of the book. The author did not use magic well at all, I liked it much better when it wasn't obvious if the character was a witch or not. I think Witch Child should have been left by itself, it leaves the reader the imagine the ending, and the plot in this book seemed to drag on and on."
2,Not the best,"I really enjoyed Witch Child and was very glad to see that there was a second book ""Sorceress"" but was deeply disappointed by it. I haven't even finished it yet. The second book is written from todays time and from a different girls point of view. I just couldn't get in to this book. It wasn't as exciting as the first one and was kind of boring."
2,Very dull sequel.,"""Sorceress"" was very, very disappointing. ""Witch Child"" was interesting, mystifying, and intriguing. This book held none of those qualities, and I just felt obligated to finish it. Author Celia Rees should have just made a sequel to the book, without using Agnes and Alison. Those two characters made the story stop and go, ruining any and all flow. The conclusion of Mary's life was mundane and boring - nothing at all like the rest of her life. What a letdown. I do not recommend."
2,Very low quality gel pack,"The brace works perfectly and I find it really comfortable; I've used in on my knees and ankles so far. The gel pack, on the other hand is complete rubish; it only stays hot/cold for about 5 minutes. I've decided to keep the brace and use it to hold a standard ice bag (so far it has worked). I DON'T recommend this product, there are a lot of other similar braces with gel packs that actually work."
4,Finally music that is approached for the art it is!,"I popped it in as soon as I got home, and from the first track, I had a grin and a chill up my back as if i was 8 years old again and listening to my moms' Bowie albums. It's not for everybody, but that's the idea. If you are a fan of Gary Numan, or Portishead, this debut will not dissapoint. It takes about a dozen listens to get it all in and that's it's charm."
4,A great start,This is a pretty hard to get out of print disc. But it does rock if you can get it! Very rough and atmospheric. It's a really interesting sign of what was to come. Add N to X have become one of the most creative and insane groups to come out of electronic music.This disc is not as strong as the others but is an important buy for fans. I like it!
2,the package had a Hole in it,the package had a Hole in it and I am missing the short brackets and the long bracket and I'm not sure on the Bolt and not they were scattered inside thank you Stan
4,breezy read,"Only about a third of this volume is alloted for Monk's life--which is not bad; the rest is about the various recordings he made.You get enough to wet your appetite. Makes you want to look for something more indepth, etc. Worth buying, though, as it is written by a genuine fan of Monk and the whole jazz scene. I don't regret getting it."
3,"Stiff, but useful","I got these gloves because I have teenagers who are learning to cook. They're afraid of using just a hotpad or smaller cloth gloves when reaching in the oven. I think this is good for them, but I find it too stiff to manipulate my grasp when I'm cooking. Overall, good protection, but experienced cooks may want something more flexible."
5,Bird's Beak Bravo,"Great for radishes and small items where the accuracy and control of the reverse curve blade are required. Also dynamite for removing the lead seal on wine bottles. ""Sharp as a Shun"" should be part of the vernacular. I love this bird's beak and use it more than I had imagined I would."
4,bolster edge to sharp,the bottom of the blade is to pointy near the bolster & you can cut your self real easy .I like all my other knives very much . They hold an edge for a very long time.I only buy Shun now .
2,YUCKY,"I was so......disapointed when this was delivered. It doesn't look anything like the picture. The colors are absolutely horrible, especially the background, in the picture its a light color, in real its dark. The only good thing about this is the quality is excellent. Much like a $300-400 cost. I sent mine back. I was very sad about it because the price was ever so right, the picture was just so right, the reality it sucked"
4,"Started out a little slow, but................","I did enjoy this book, so much that I ran out to by the second book in the series Bubble in Trouble. As you get into the book and start to know the characters it is very amusing. If you enjoy Janet Evanovich books about Stephanie Plum, you will also enjoy Bubbles!"
4,Loved it!,"What a great book! I got it to read on vacation and was actually laughing out loud on the plane. I found Bubbles a refreshing character and her adventures entertaining. Can't wait to read more about her. Being very familiar with the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, I enjoyed the local references."
1,Bubbles is no Stephanie,"What a disappointment! Strohmeyer is trying to be Evanovich, but she fails in every respect: character, romantic interest, eccentric family member. She would have done better to be herself, instead of being such an obvious copy. Maybe someone who hadn't read any of Janet Evanovich's books could enjoy this, but I doubt any true follower of Stephanie, Morelli and Ranger could."
1,"Don't be fooled, this ain't the real thing","I know Stephanie Plum, and Bubbles, you are no Stephanie. Try as I might, I couldn't warm up to this dopey, pale imitation of the truly hilarious Plum books. This book didn't elicit so much as a half-hearted smirk from me. Not funny, no plot, lifeless, unbelievable characters--what a waste of time. The Bubbles in this book are flat, flat, flat."
2,Who wrote this book? Sarah or Janet?,Very sad imitation of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum stories. I looked for this book all over the place and was so excited about finally finding it. Was I ever disappointed....This book was neither a mystery nor a romance - it was just plain stupid. I certainly won't purchase the next book.
4,fun romp,"I admit, i was reluctant to read about the barbie doll/teen mom/hairdresser detective, but I am converted. Bubbles is a similar character type to Stephanie Plum and fun to read about. I have one big HOWEVER (which also applies to Stephanie): why does the author want to describe her as dumb? Obviously, she isn't, and obviously, the author isn't; and obviously, she would be boring if she were really dumb. So why tell us that she barely made it out of high school and flunked every course but one at the community college? A character like Bubbles would really be ashamed of such a thing, unless it was explainable by deep post divorce depression, or revenge or something. In short, I am not dumb, the author is not dumb, the reader is not dumb, why try to paint the character as dumb?"
2,Bubbles Unbound - Poor Man's Stephanie Plum,"I don't like to be mean right off the bat, but I cannot hold my tongue on this one.This is just another version of the Janet Evanovich series staring Stephanie Plum, except that series is well written, funny and far superior. The similarities are astounding and I am actually surprised that this series could be published since it is so much like a whole other series.See below:Bubbles, hairdresser to reporter - Stephanie, from sales/marketing to bounty hunterBubbles wacky mom - Stephanie, wacky grandmother and friendBubbles hot guy - Stephanie, two hot guysThe list goes on and on.The big difference here is in the writing. I have laugh out loud moments in my Stephanie books and none in this one. I care about Stephanie and have a hard time caring about Bubbles - she just seems ridiculous.The story is not good, the wit is not there and it was hard to finish this book.I wish only good things for this author, but I cannot recommend this series."
4,Bubbily fun,"Many friends suggested the Bubbles series and I took the opportunity recently to try it out, starting at the beginning. It was very enjoyable.Bubbles is a hairdresser, she's also got a model's figure and she's blonde. She also has taken the opportunity offered her by her ex-husband trying to take away her allowance (after her supporting him throughout his courses to become a lawyer) by inventively doing as many courses as she can in the local community college. She thinks that she's found her role in life in the Journalism course, but she's still doing hair in Sandy's House of Beauty, after all she does have a daughter to support.She gets drawn into a murder with the delectable Steve Stiletto, and her vow of celibacy and her very life is in danger.It owes a lot to Janet Evanovich but is quite a fun read. It kept me enthralled throughout. The Twists that the story took weren't very unexpected but did add to the enjoyment and kept it from being stale."
1,Not even a good Summer reading,"The characters and plot were very weak. I found the name ""Bubbles"" to be very annoying and made the character hard to like and the story even harder to believe. Strohmeyer's characters was obviously very similar to Evanovich's (love interest, crazy family, etc.) -- which could be a good thing. But it wasn't even as remotely entertaining in it's own right."
3,"Entertaining, but not deep","One of the worst things a book (or movie) can do IMO is be boring. This book certainly kept my interest. I enjoyed the characters and the funny things they did. Yes, there is some similarity to Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series and, no, Bubbles doesn't hold a candle to Stephanie. But, hey, Bubbles is still fun. I kept reading, turning pages, and wondering what would happen next.That being said, I did find Bubbles a little dated. For example, the author has her wearing hot pants and halter tops with big hair. Perhaps if this book were set in the 80's that would fit, but in the year 2000 (when this book was published), try low riding jeans and tummy-bearing tanks. Not to mention that super straight hair has been in since the 90's. Also the music Bubbles listens to (Earth, Wind, and Fire for example) would be too early for what someone would listen to who spent her teens in the 1980's.That being said, overall, Bubbles was pretty likeable and down to earth."
1,I just don't get it.,"I purchased the unabridged audio version of Bubble's Unbound with the understanding that this novel was supposed to be humorous. Boy, was I disappointed. Bubbles is just another sad Steph Plum knockoff, but worse, Bubbles is even more inept than Plum. If such a thing can be believed.Worse, this novel isn't particularly funny. Bubbles Unbound was like a bad episode of Lucy... But with a silly ex, and a teenage daughter instead of Rickie. I found the humor in this novel cringe inducing. (The scene with the 'jumper,' the long and sad back-story about the main character's lack of education and compulsive community college course-taking).The characters names (Stilleto, Bubbles), were off-putting and too 'cute' for my taste.Overall, I found Bubbles Unbound to be a waste of time. It didn't even produce a chuckle."
2,Bubbles is NOT even close to Janet Evanovich's Stephanie,I was really hoping for another type of Stephanie series. I've only read this one (but purchased the others) and I'm sincerely hoping they'll get better. I don't like the way the author has made Bubbles an airhead. One can be a hair stylist that enjoys nail polish and have brains on top of that. She's written as if she doesn't have a clue to what's going on and doesn't really care.I prefer my heroine's to be a little stronger
1,not really that entertaining.,"I like to read a book when I work out. The measure of a good book is one that makes me forget about working out and that I want to keep reading when I have finished the work out. This book failed on both accounts. Of course I will have to admit to comparing it to Evanovich's books, and this frankly isn't even in the same ballpark, I am sorry to say. I really wanted to like this book. But the ideas were not really new, the characters seemed to copy that of Janet E, and the lines were not as humorous. Stick with Janet."
4,Super fun!,Bubbles is so much fun. I loved reading this book because it made me laugh and it kept me interested.
3,Passable,"I am being very generous by giving this book 3 stars. The mystery part was pretty good. But the atmosphere was bad. This was suppose to be a cozy mystery, but I couldn't find anything cozy about it. I did not like the language, personality, choice of words, attitude, or style of dress of Bubbles. The only good thing about her, is that she had a good relationship with her mother and daughter, and loved them dearly. In the end, she solved the mystery of 2 deaths.But I am not encouraging anybody not to try these books - I know someone who absolutely loves Bubbles books after having borrowed my copy of ""Bubbles Unbound"". I'm just more conservative than Bubbles, so I could not relate to her."
4,Bubbles' the BOMB!,"I just ""found"" Bubbles, and what a great find it is! I enjoy the ""light"" reading and the humor intertwined with crime and mystery.Keep it up, Bubbles Yablonski, hairdresser/journalist!"
5,Good Service/Quick Service,"I found this vendor to offer good, quick service with little hassle.Love the book, I had never listened to the first book in the series on Bubbles Jablonski."
5,What the heck? This book won the Agatha Award!,"It's no wonder this book won the Agatha Award for Best First Mystery. It's fun, fast-paced, well written and even has a deeper message that gives the book some depth. I'm looking forward to her next one, Bubbles In Trouble. If you like Grafton and Evanovich, like I do, you'll like Bubbles Yablonsky."
5,I wish all mysteries were this good...,"If you like Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum, you will love Bubbles Yablonsky. (Horrible name, but great book) It is a laugh out loud mystery. Run, don't walk and get this book."
3,Does Bubbles Keep Her Effervescence,"Bubbles is indeed a marvelous, believable creation. However, the blatant imitation of Janet Evanovich (the master) is annoying. As one goes on, an occasional line is so well written that one is forced to continue. Overall, Strohmeyer has a long way to go to catch up to Evanovich. The same scene written by JE would have me laughing out loud, but with Strohmeyer it just does not peak dramatically. It is rewarding to see Bubbles ex and his preppie, lying 2nd wife get theirs in the end. And Bubbles does prove to be intelligent, diligent and likable. I will try the second, but not before devouring Evanovich's soon-to-be-available Eighth."
2,Wannabe Plum,"This book is entertaining, but what takes away from it is the fact that the entire time that I was reading it I kept thinking of Stephanie Plum. Bubbles' mom reminds me of Stephanie's grandma - Stilleto is obviously a copy of Joe. Even Mr. Salvo has similarities to Vinnie... same story line. Not perfect Jersey girl finds herself in trouble that she's not cut out for, in love (or lust) with men she shouldn't be, and surrounded by kooky characters.It's worth reading for the fact that it is an easy read. However, I would suggest if you're looking for a good book of this nature, read Janet. If you've read them all already, read them again."
5,OUTSTANDING FILM - One of the Best Yet!,"This movie is absolutely one of the finest films I have watched in a very long time. Though the subject matter is ""taboo"" this film does it with such class and style, that it just seems natural that these two ""Brothers"" were destined from birth to be ""together"". This is NOT a pornographic movie... it is a true ""Love Story"" in the most wonderful of ways.I was completely taken by it and enjoyed it. You will too!Love like this, should never, ever be denied.Buy this movie... you'll want it in your collection! I know I am glad I did!"
5,Fan-flipping-tastic,"Although I was squeamish about the taboo nature of the story, I quickly overcame my reservations. These two characters were in love from the day the younger one was born. The love affair is apparent when the characters were five and 10 (ish). Even the mother sees it. The father recgnizes it. The stepfather is aware of it. When adults, and just after the death of their mother, the two brothers explosively unite in what is one of the most beautifully acted love scenes ever recorded on film. The actors are so believable in their love for each other--in and out of bed--that it is impossible for me to say anything remotely negative about their performances. The movie is a visual treat. These ridiculosly handsome guys, and the beautiful home where the characters grew up in affluence, are magnificently filmed. Am I gushing too much? Not a chance."
1,SKIP IT SKIP IT !!!!,The most boring dvd I now own. It was a waste of the camera crew and the actors and the writers. I may toss this into a donation bin somewhere.
2,Not really reflecting the struggling love between brothers,"I was quite disappointed after viewing this movie. I was expecting to see the struggles when older brother realizes that he falls in love with his younger brother, but this part was totally skipped. The movie portraits that the parents found out the unusual intimacy between the brothers when one is 16 and the other is 10 years old. I think this is ridiculous. That kind of intimacy to me is totally normal. And therefore the transition from brothers to lovers is kind of strange to me. If this intimacy happens between two brothers both in their adolescences, that will be something to worry about. Many other books I read to talk about this kind of forbidden love are hundred times better than this movie."
3,So much potential...,"Touchy subject, but not so much an issue since their characters were not fully explored leaving their relationship as brothers not so believable. I really wanted to give this film a huge thumbs up, but I felt the storyline was thin in a few areas. I also had issues with continuity and how the adolescent years were skipped entirely. The relationship between the two brothers could have offered us better treatment if attention was given to character development during those all-important teen years; yet we are jolted by the swift jump from boyhood to adulthood. Also, portions of the film were crossing over to soap opera mode, including the repetitive music score. Given the disconnect I had with identifying them as brothers throughout the film, I did find the chemistry between Cardoso and Vasconcellos very engaging, and dare i say, almost distracting since they are both incredibly handsome men. Kudos to casting for pairing these men together."
5,"Interesting, and again a refreshing change","Yes a refreshing change of pace for a gay film, so I really liked it enough to buy it later after I rented it. Two good looking guys staring in the roles and so good writing to top it off I recommend it for sure."
4,it is a great movie but a little disturbing,"It is great to see the love that can keep people together but when it is brothers it dose make this feel wrong. but the movie is great and has a good plot,"
4,From Beginning to End,"This was a beautifully filmed story, and very sensual. The entire cast was terrific. From their childhood to adulthood, the brothers' character development was excellent, and I really cared about their relationship. The story itself was unusual, but it was handled with outstanding sensitivity. And I must say I was a bit surprised, yet pleased with the ending."
3,Interesting,I thought the subject was interesting and the movie was good..but nothing spectacular. Lead actors are handsome and they seemed to really connect in their scenes.
2,Surprisingly (not in a good way) like a 1980's movie of the week,"This film had so much potential but simply did not live up to it. First off the musical score is the absolute worst, like something from an early '80's movie of the week. Next too much time was spent in childhood with emphasis on the parents, who have little to no impact on the incestuous brothers in adulthood. So one has to ask why such time was spent on them in the first place.The subject matter of the film could have been really interesting but in that this film exists in some bizarro-world where pretty much everyone involved in the brother's lives seem just about 100% ok with their relationship that shatters social mores of both homosexuality as well as incest. That alone makes it seem too unbelievable, especially all the family members.Of course some of this can be forgiven whenever the two incredibly attractive leads romantically cavort, but overall does not make up for the films flaws."
1,dullsville,"I love films with gay theme, can be positive affirmations. This however was a who cares regarding the story. Poor quality disc from vendor, skipped at times but didn't matter as didn't feel was missing anything important or interesting."
1,Spare yourself!,"If the write-up on this film leads you to expect an interesting story about a quasi-incestuous relationship between two half-brothers, spare yourself. Spoiler alert: the boys love each other as children, as teens and as adults. Period. There's no story development, just tedious sequences of the boys swimming together, then kissing, then swimming. It has all the drama of a 4-hour commercial for speed-o's. To paraphrase a critic's assessment of Poulenc, this director had absolutely nothing to say...and he said it. If you want really soft-porn, but have a heart condition, go for it."
2,deceiving reviews,"The movie was at best a gay soft core porn. Its acting was awful, the editing was choppy and story line was artificial. I never really comment on movies, but before you spend your money, reconsider this one."
4,Emotional and Moving Movie,Some people may be turned off by this sibling romance but it was very thoughtful and well executed. It was a joy to see something this beautiful brought to life.
4,Unlike Anything You've Seen Before,"I think the mere premise of this movie is enough to award it some positive feedback. It's a movie that's heartwarming and uncomfortable at the same time. I recommend it for someone looking for something different and someone who has a very open mind. As some reviewers have noted, there's a certain lack of depth in the film... and especially in the last half, it's especially cosmetic. A lot of skin (not always a bad thing), but not much substance. I recommend it, though-- you will never see a movie like this in the U.S. ... which is an unfortunate reality."
4,Too much swimming! in movie.,"I thought there was too much swimming and not enough intimate gay love making. I did enjoy the music in this movie and the friendship these two men had as a kid. That was wonderful. But I would of liked to see at least ten more minutes of intimate gay sex love making (that is why I watch this stuff.) That would of been enough to upgrade my rating to five stars for this movie. Despite this deficiency, this movie was very excellently made."
1,Boring,I expected more from this movie. The storyline could have been expanded on more and the music score was just prosaic.
2,Boring.,"The movie did not connect with me on any emotional level. I Kept fast forwarding to see if it got better - it did not. I got that the brothers were in love and found it difficult to be apart. I got that the parents identified that the bond between the boys was very strong - maybe more than brotherley love. I did not feel any emotional connections with parents, children, situation, NOTHING. To me it was a waste of money and I will not be sucked into believing the blurb on a cover, ever again."
1,Boring,I couldn't get through this incredibly boring film. Not worth watching. Most of it is just showing 2 children playing. Worst movie ever made
4,beautiful,This movie is a beautiful love story. I am going to recommend this movie to all of my friends. I didn't even mind that it wasn't in English :-)
4,you will never want it to end,"This is a wonderful movie that involves what others might consider taboo. While the movie does not actually deal in depth with issues of love between brothers or being gay itself, it has been written well to make the audience love it. the writer has perfected(almost) the world to make the movie more light and not too serious(like Big Eden). first half was awesome showcasing the intimacy between the boys. second half was all lovey dovey with scenes that will make one melt. both cases, the chemistry was awesome. there is no comparison to that. at the end, it just makes one want the movie to never end. could have dealt with the issues a little deeper. thats why one 4 stars. overall, great concept made light to melt and keep the audience happy till the end. have seen it 3 times so far and still want to see it again."
3,Not value for money,"Acting was good, story line only fair as it was predictable, hardly a memorable movie, probably only worth a $1.99 hire fee rather than the $3.99 I paid!"
4,"Not entirely as described, but the contents SUPERB!","The cover of this biography shows more wear and tear than was described; however, the contents are remarkable. Superb writing and a bonus of illustrations and photos. If one really has an interest in knowing the life of the remarkable composer Beethoven, then this is THE book for purchase."
5,Wonderful,"It was love at first sight for Reverend Dougal MacNab when he met Elspeth Cameron and he lost no time in trying to persuade her to marry him. Elspeth, however, was convinced she would never make a suitable wife for a minister. Dougal didn't agree -- but he didn't know of the scandal that lay like a shadow over her past.This book is connected with My Lady of the Fuschias."
2,Not what I expected,I was not thrilled with this purchase. The water is not bad but just not what I had expected. It is bitter unless you serve it cold.
2,Healthy but not tasty,"My neighbour recommended me this product. He told me about the health benefits of drinking coconut water and how much he liked it. Yet, when I tried it, I did not like the taste. I literally had to swallow it quick so that I did not feel the taste."
4,excellent packaging for an essentiatial rehydration solution,"Coconut water is an ideal natural rehydration solution -- much less sodium than many commercial sports-drinks, and plenty of potassium to keep the electrolyte levels humming.Zico has done an excellent job of packaging pure coconut water in convenient, ready to use packs. 11oz is perhaps a bit more than one would expect to get from a single coconut (so seems like a very generous size to those of us who are used to getting coconut water from the source!). The flavors are quite subtle, so much so that they seem unneccessary -- my favorite, by far, is the plain."
4,Very good coconut water,"I've had fresh coconuts from every continent they grow on, and as it doesn't taste as good as a fresh one, it is hands down the best packaged coco water I or my wife have ever had (we have tried at least a dozen different packaged ones). They go down too quick for the price; maybe 3-4 good swallows when your thirsty."
5,Packaged with aluminum,"To the reviewer who commented that the tetrapak contains aluminum:The inside panel of aluminum is sealed between two polyethelene sheets, so I doubt there is any risk of contamination/exposure to the aluminum.Apart from that, these are great (and cheaper than buying them directly from the company).Don't assume it's going to be some super sugery sweet taste. Drink one after working out and you'll fall in love with them. You'll never drink another gatorade."
5,Best Coconut Water Ever!!!!,I have tried most varieties of Coconut water and this one is by far the best. My wife is the pickiest person I know and even she loved them. I know they are slightly expensive. But when you wife is Pregnant and wants Coconut water you had better get her the best.
3,Not a Complete Concert!!!,"This CD - Live At The Rainbow, used to be a double album in the seventies, I bought it back then for proof. It is missing a couple of tracks, namely; Anonymus, but other than that it is a good CD. Because it is missing a few tracks, is why I give it 3 stars. I hope it might get reissued properly, the way it was originally,the way it was released for the U.S.A."
5,Focus at their best,"I remember hearing Hocus Pocus for the first time as a child and being blown away by the sheer imagination and BLAZING guitar work in the song. This live album captures the band in superb form. ""Answers Questions: Questions Answers"" is the highlight for me. The guitar work is so far ahead of it's time. It sounds almost vocal in textures. There is even a wholetone scale he does in the middle of it that just screams. Originality pervades every song. And the version of ""Hocus Pocus"" is hysterical. ""Sylvia"" is another gem. It should have been a hit. Definitely a must have in any CD collection."
4,Great example of local history,"This book answered a lot of questions I had about 'The Wally' and my hometown history of Loudonville, Ohio. Good source of past railroad lore, also."
5,Horse Dreamer,"I found this book to be a wonderful example of historical fiction. The author obviously has a deep interest in Minnesota history, particularly the period of the Dakota uprising. I found his main characters lively and charismatic and his account of the time to be an accurate one. I look forward to reading another book by Mr. Homstad!"
4,A Very Good Read,"In Horse Dreamer, Homstad effectively weaves a compelling story of torn identities into one of the darkest chapters of Minnesota history. If you're a histoy buff who also likes a good novel, this book is definitely for you."
4,"Pass the bialys and lutefisk, please","Foodies who travel a lot are always on the look-out for local or regional specialties when they visit a new area. Like Ropa Vieja or a Cuban Sandwich in Miami, or Cincinnati-style chili (always ""five-way""), or a Garbage Plate in Rochester, or a Beef on Weck in Buffalo, Hot Brown in Louisville. I think I would argue that some of what the author considers ""local cuisine,"" though, is too widely available to qualify -- like Chicken-Fried Steak (which originated in south Texas but you can get it anywhere in the western half of the country), or breakfast tacos (now ubiquitous, even in supermarkets). She organizes dishes by courses, but there's a regional index in the back. Each recipe is introduced by a sometimes lengthy sociological essay. I have to say those for gumbo, muffulettas, and king cakes were pretty good renditions (though, naturally, everyone has their own ""best"" version). I believe I'll pass on the ""prairie oysters"" and the Hangtown Fry, though."
3,Just a valve tool,"At the time, I was not able to find a valve tool for my autococker.I give it a 3 because it just does it's job and nothing wow about it."
2,A bit of a rip-off,"The book looks big but the trick is that only some of the pages actually have names and the rest is fluff. Plus, it's bilingual - you flip it over and the same stuff is repeated in Spanish to make a small book look worth the price. You can find the same names for free on the internet..."
1,Lacking....,"I ordered this book and Nombres Exoticos Para Bebe. At first glance this book was 5 times thicker then NEPB, but upon futher review it lacked substance. It is a nice setup in the way they have the meaning of every name both in spanish and english. The problem was the names where mostly common spanish names such as Roberto or Alejandra and even some stranger names that just sounded funny. I still haven't finished going thru the whole book mainly because of the the lack of nice names. The type is small and I found myself squinting to read some of the meanings to my wife. The biggest disappointment was the book was split into half. Meaning from page X to X the meaning where in Spanish and from page X to X they where in english not sure why use this approach and waste ink and paper instead the meaning should of been together first in one language and then in the other not print the name twice. Maybe they where trying to make the book look big.?"
3,Can't get the full swing,"Fundamentally, the concept and mechanics of this game are great. However, due to the short plastic club that is provided, you cannot duplicate your real golf swing. So, the true value of it helping your ""real"" golf game kind of goes by the wayside. Being able to swing- and have it motion-captured- is cool because you really do control the action."
3,Damaged,The box was crushed on the right side! May have worked but I was scared to open it with the side being damaged.
4,"Interesting piece, nicely performed","Most people, I suspect, are familiar with Gorecki through his 3rd Symphony. His 2nd is not quite as accesible as the 3rd, but is quite rewarding in its own way. A touch more dissonant, perhaps, but it contains a lot of the same slowly building sequences and gradually increasing dynamics. It's definitely music that should be paid attention to as opposed to played in the background. The performance is quite competent and somewhat idomatically Polish. Although the sound is not always perfect and the performance is occasionally shaky, this disc is great value for money and an excellent choice for people interested in further exploring Gorecki's orchestral writing."
1,disappointing,Górecki: Symphony No. 2 Copernican; Beatus VirI did not like this CD. Some parts of the music were so inaudible the volume had to be turned way way up just to be sure that it was still playing. Then suddenly you get blasted into the next room. I could not suggest anyone purchase this.
2,Much too watery,"Had previously purchased Boucheron body lotion and loved it. When I got low I wanted to make sure I had a replacement, so I ordered the 6.6 ounces from Amazon. The new purchase was watery and I was very disappointed. I have decided to go elsewhere to get my next jar of Boucheron lotion. My guess is that it was watered down to look like the bottle was full."
1,Rusting,"The metal parts on the front side of the filter were rusted, God knows how long had this filter been waiting in warehouses before it was shipped to me.I bought it thinking that the brand was respectable and the product should be of good quality. The paper element is a kind of thin cardboard, the foam gasket is uneven, the metal parts are rusting. It was not made in the USA.I had to return the filter, and order a Denso First Time Fit filter."
2,Disappointed,"Since I assume someone will be looking at this, here is my problem: I heard Carl Day's piano version ot ""All I Ask of You,"" (Music by Candleligt), loved it, wanted to buy the CD. Turned out there were 2 CDs, and ""All I Ask of You"" was not on the one I ordered.Then someone told me about Carl Fried's CD and I ordered that. I didn't care for the way he played his flute (tremulo style), or whatever the instrument was. My son told me I should never have paid $25 for it, there were less expensive versions available. So I now have 2 CDs that I never listen to in my car.Sorry to be so negative. The disappointment is probably my fault. I am in my 80s, and walking is uncomfortable or I would go to a store that sold CDs and ask for help.Sincerely,Barbara Malley"
2,Yes this book is aptly named &#65533;,"or perhaps we could also have called ita cheap read .....Tesser, a young American, can we say totally bohemian, is living in London trying to make her mark both in the world of cinematography and also in her world of sexuality.Although our heroine tries very hard to build up her self image as a serious filmaker and a hard hitting expose reporter she finds her libido overwhelming. As such, what we do have in this book is a lot of sex but little erotica ...For me ... I didn't like it but it gets a whopping 2 stars cause of all the sex that Tesser seems to have enjoyed ....."
5,Love all her books!,Love all her books. Her sense of humor is refreshing! She is a new author for me but very glad I found her. All her books have been great. Wedding the highlander is one of many.
5,Fascinating Look Into the New Buy-Sell Culture,"Nissanoff is on to something big here. The global consumer is undergoing an evolutionary transformation, and this book nails it.The book talks about how the auction culture is reshaping the very definition of ""consumer."" We're shifting from a mass-marketed-to culture to a participatory buy-and-sell culture. Nissanoff considers this shift a huge opportunity for all kinds of business people, calling it an ""economic juggernaut."" Businesses like I Sold It On eBay and Trading Post help facilitate this new buy-and-sell culture. All kinds of analytic services that help people figure out what to buy and sell (and when) are cropping up, too.Nissanoff explains, ""anyone who understands how to maximize the value-to-utility life cycle of their possesions will be rewarded with a more prosperous but less costly lifestyle."""
4,"Interesting premise, could have organized better","While the main ideas in the book are not novel or ground-breaking, the author sustains the reader's interest through a very simple, ""anecdote"" based narration and some observations. The discussion focusing on the specific domains of a wide variety of mediums ranging from thrift shops to the auction houses of the world is very interesting. So is the discussion on future value and opportunity cost. The excellent premise(s) of the book gets lost in somewhat a rambling organization of thoughts and anecdotes. There is seemingly no real transition from chapter to chapter, making the reading somewhat annoying at times. Other than that, a good read. One wishes the author abstracted the examples (all or most of the examples are from his own or his friends) to more well-put observations. Anyone who has read any book on the impact of E-bay will easily relate to the topics, but not necessarily gain very new perspectives."
1,Garbage. A TOTAL EGO TRIP !!!,"Self-serving and repetitive. Author loves to talk about great he is. Seldom has a book left such a lingering bad taste in my mouth.If you love to go into Tiffany's and have your overpriced jewelry presented to you in a little blue box, this book may be for you. Yawn. (It's actually one of his examples... need I say more.)If you're status-conscious and will pay 20 times what a product is really worth this book may be for you. Or maybe: if you're a status-conscious (lesser) sucker hoping to buy it (slightly used) for 5 times what it's really worth. Personally, I can only hope that the days of such hyperconsumerism are over.You can buy this book for a penny on Amazon. Not that it's worth it - but I'd call that TRUE ""Future Shop"", folks."
5,Excellent Reading,"Donald Hilliard, Jr. gives excellent advice on how to seek God's guidance and mercy in everything! Wonderful reading!"
3,"Great story-telling, though no true epilogue","This is a great story with well developed characters. This is a major accomplishment, if you consider the story itself has no compromise with spacial or even temporary boundaries (at one time Ryder, the main character, is miles distant from the hotel he left hours before, and suddenly he just opens a door and there he is back in his hotel).This amazingly well-crafted circular motion permeates the whole story. The only caveat is that all this great array of movement that ends up making the story so uniquely peculiar and interesting leaves little room for closure. So, if you like closure, as I do, you may feel a little disappointed with this book, since Ishiguro conducts a circular ride back to where he started from. Still, I couldn't care less. All this movement, motion and travel made the book unique and amazing. In my opinion the best book by a great author."
3,An Absurdist's Nightmare,"The author does a wonderful job of weaving the mystery of dream, nightmare, and absurdity into a work of prose. I was unable to completely finish the book, because it was too-dreamlike for me. I actually became bored, because the tone was too obvious. It's intentionally filled with questions and mystery, but for me, the lack of direct storyline made it so rambling, I eventually stopped caring what was real and what was not.People who don't want a direct line, but who are in the mood for a mysterious weave, will likely enjoy this tale. That I didn't like it, is really more my problem than the author's."
4,"A tremendous book, but not for everyone","This book has never received the commendation it deserves. I was riveted by the story's dream logic, which seemed to me to be a perfect evocation of the life of the celebrity. In addition, I can't think of a book I've read that is more suffused with a sense of grief than this one. I read the bk back when it was new in paperback (1996)& there are images from it that I still flash on now & then. However, the bk is not for everyone. I'm also a David Lynch fan (""Lost Highways"" is my favorite movie of the 1990s), I think Denis Johnson's ""Jesus' Son"" is one of the great bks of the late 20th century, I relish intellectual puzzles, and I have a lot of patience for an author who's willing to go out on a limb to tell a different kind of story. If this sounds like you, then you'll probably devour this bk; otherwise, you might find it hard going."
1,painful,"just painful. i read it until the end just begging for some redeeming quality, but never found it. very happy to be through the book"
1,Faint praise,"Ishuguro does a magnificant job of creating the sense of frustration that one experiences in a dream, simlar to the ""old hag"" - dreams where you can't run, or can't get where you want to go. But, frankly, who wants to experience that? It created a sense of pent up irritation in me as I read. What's the point? I"
1,Impenetrable,"I adore Ishiguro. I was bereft when I finished The Remains of the Day. Thought A Pale View of Hills was fabulous. I absolutely abhorred the Unconsoled. I confess, I read to enjoy myself. I have a degree in English literature. I don't have a problem with analysis, but this was too much work to get any enjoyment out of it at all."
5,An Incomparable Read,"I hurled this book across many a floor on many occaisions in complete frustration, but it never laid low for long. I'm still desperately seeking something as original, as engrossing and as memorable to read (to no avail).I remain unconsoled. of course."
5,brilliant,"I loved this book so completely. It is so devastatingly tragic and beautiful.It tells the story of a renowned pianist making a stay in a small European town awaiting a performance. The drama that unfolds is sometimes surreal, but once you let yourself get swept into the rhythm of the book, it starts to make sense, and be meaningful.So many characters who have led lives of timid desperation, looking for a saviour of some sort. The role of the celebrity, of the artist, is also questioned here, as is the religious observation of art.Truly a mind-bending read. Read it and weep for the heartbreak that is humankind. Weep for the wounds that we create for ourselves."
1,"An ""unconsoled"" reader !!","This book just plain ... I'm sorry folks... doesn't measure up!! What an incredible waste of effort on Ishiguro's part and of time and money on mine. I wouldn't give this book to my worst enemy...unless I wanted to bore him to death. I can appreciate the Kafka-esque quality about it but that's it. What leaves me more perplexed then trying to figure out what Ishigura is trying to achieve is attempting to fathem how on earth this thing got published in the first place and unleashed on a well-meaning, unsuspecting reading public."
1,Couldn't finish it,The book never gets anywhere. I kept waiting for something to happen and finally gave up 60% of the way through it. I think this is the only book that I have stopped reading.
1,Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?,"Somewhere around page 120 I made the horrible decision to commit to reading this entire novel. I told myself that I would be rewarded with some insane twist that I could never envision at this stage. I joked, with my friend who recommended Ishiguro, that I had no clue what was going on.Halfway through, I convinced myself that the prize would come in the end.Three quarters of the way in, a momentum began to build in my mind that the surprise was imminent.With only a few pages left, I thought it would be an even bigger twist; Given that there was such little room left. How could it be possible to pull off such a feat?There is no prize.Do not listen to those who are afraid to sound ignorant or unenlightened, this book sucks. This book is so bad, it motivated me to write my first ever internet review of any product. The only reason that I am not furious, is because I borrowed this waste of time from the library."
5,Loved it - Hated it.,"I finished reading this book over two weeks ago and I still can't get it out of my thoughts. My thoughts specifically are, ""WHAT??"" Even though this book is frustrating to a degree where I would have liked to have chucked it out of a moving car, it was far and away one of the better and more memorable books I have ever read.I'm glad I didn't read the reviews prior to taking on this challenge, I may not have done so if I did. While I kept hoping that all of the issues presented would tidy themselves up in neat little packages, I then realized that this is not a Hollywood movie and I needed to relax and enjoy the very bizarre journey.There is a story to be told and, you may end up hating every one of the characters at some point, but it is well worth every minute of your time."
2,I am unconsoled with this book!,"I read 300 pages of Ishiguro's ""Unconsoled"" and had to give up. The novel is set up like a dream or nightmare, depending on your point of view. Me I just wanted to wake-up! The dream state that Ishiguro had his main character Ryder in becomes a vehicle for any indulgence or mistake by the author. Kafka summed up the absurd in quite fewer pages and much better in The Trial. Kafka keeps your heart beating with K.'s breathless anxiety. The Unconsoled is a page turner, but dead-pan, emotionless, and lifeless. No doubt Ishiguro intended this since he is working with the dream state. I kind of felt like a zombie turning the pages after awhile. For me it had me wondering why I was making the trip and spending the time to read it, not a good sign. The only person unconsoled at the end of this novel is the reader. That being said, Ishiguro's ""The Artist of the Floating World"" was very good."
2,"Frustrating, yes. Unique, yes. Like it, not so much.","It's interesting to read the glowing reviews of this book. I almost feel like I missed something. I don't think I did.Mr. Ryder is a completely unsympathetic character. There is nothing to hold on to and no reason to care about him. If this were a character study alone, this might be enought to move you through it, but as the protaganist within in a maze of metaphor, I needed him to pull me through. Someone that I at least had some interest in or found at all redeming. I kept thinking ""who cares what happens to you in your shallow self-centered world."" And that made it very difficult to ""get"" the book as a whole or even make it to the end.I found it wholely unsastisfying and much because I had the feeling that Mr. Ryder was nothing more than a terrible cad."
2,I didn't get it,"Whatever you want to call this one--dream fiction, surrealism, or Kafkaesque--the twists and turns fail to inform the reader of anything significant except for the fact that the main character always manages to forget the most essential questions about life. Yes, I know we fail to communicate in day to day life... but isn't there something more? I found this book to be an empty exercise of prosaic tricks."
3,Hmmm...,"This book left me scratching my head. Of course, I'm sure that it was meant to. It's a puzzling story embodying the concept of alienation in a very modern context. Ishiguro is no doubt a great writer. His language is interesting and attractive, pushing and pulling at the reader and really making one think. I had to read sentences and whole paragraphs over to catch everything that he was doing, and I'm sure I missed out on a great deal of it.That said, I didn't think too much of the Unconsoled. It was interesting and enigmatic, thought-provoking, blah, blah, blah...but I was kinda in the mood for a story, and you don't really get it here. I would definitely recommend the book, and I'm sure I'll read it again, but the reader should be prepared for some mind-numbing mental gymnastics. A spotter would be helpful-- if I had someone to discuss this book with, it would've been much more interesting. I'm going to have to read The Remains of the Day..."
2,A Very Dreamlike Novel,"In fact it was so convincingly dreamlike that it put me to sleep. That said, read some of this. It reveals what happens when people become so obsessed with artiface that they lose themselves."
1,Put downable,"After reading 'Remains of the day' - a masterpiece, I unfortunately embarked upon this tale. If you like Kafka, you'll like this. Unfortunately I HATE Kafka - I mean who cares, and I found this completely boring. It's noteeven a good size to support a wobbly table. If youre into dream stories which take a lot or working out, read this. If you're looking for something as beautiful and poignant as remains of the day you'll be dissapointed"
1,A bad dream&#65533;,"Without peer, this is the worst book I have ever read. Comparisons to Kafka are an insult. That Ishiguro got this book through an editor and publisher tells me that it exploited an opportunity to make money based on the author's previous reputation.I did two things I absolutely NEVER do: I skipped to the end to attempt to figure out what was going on, and I did not finish the book."
5,Cautionary tale to those who are selfish,"Without spoiling the book, I will just say this: it is a cautionary tale for those who are selfish - for those who have no time for anyone else but themselves. Read the first chapter over and over until you can see where Ryder is and why the narrative reads like a bad dream..."
5,unconsoled,Only at the end of the book you realise why it is titled 'unconsoled' - its the most amazing and original book that I have ever read - pure surrealism in an apparently normal environment. It adapts to your reading mood as you go along with it - one of very few books that you can read more than once and each time will be different. Hoorah! Kafka-esque even more than Kafka but not quite nabokov. William Burroughs would be envious.
2,quite a disappointment,"being an avid fan of ishiguro's works, after reading this book i felt compelled to write a review. i have read all of ishiguro's works and until i started ""the unconsoled"", i waited eagerly for each of his new novels to appear. however,i have to admit very reluctantly that this latest is definitely a disappointment. perhaps having reached a certain point in his writing career the author feels he should try his hand in a different direction. gone are the haunting characters, the restraint, the subtlety and the beauty of his previous novels. here one finds repetition upon repetition of tedious dialogue and annoying circumstances, on top of which one never quite sees the point of any of it. i still think mr. ishiguro is one of the best writers in the english language, however i do wish that he does not make further forays into this new genre."
3,"BAD DVD quality, BUT a collection item:)","...not even 1 star for the quality of DVD:both, the picture and the sound are HORRIBLE!!!! BUT, if you like underground music from one of the first singers in this category:NICO ,then go for it! WARNING: this is only for die-hard fans of Velvet Underground/NICO!"
3,Rather boring & kinda rediculous,I have to tell you that the Hap-Hazzard way that this Coroner Novicely disects this cadaver makes me wonder how good of a surgeon he would be in the event of an emergency.... I would not want him to touch my Turkey at Thanksgiving...that's for sure~
1,wheres my scribe CD,I ordered this CD about a year ago now and never got it I was so pissed. thats all I remember for this situation cuz it was so long ago it slipped my mind. SUPER PISSED! >:/
5,The best EP ever.,"All's effort after ""Allroy Sez"" is just awesome. It has the same really poppy style of ""Sez"", yet less of the so called cheesy harmonies the band claimed to experiment with.Dave Smalley really is an emotional guy on this record with songs like ""Wishing Well"", ""Wrong Again"", and ""Daveage"". Karl Alvarez's(""Skin Deep"" and ""I hate to love"") and Bill Stevenson's(""Just Perfect"" and ""Postage"") songs are even better and still tackle the subject of girls and break ups. I won't forget Stephen Egerton's instrumental ""Son-o-Qua"", they jam on this one ALLular style like on ""Uranus"" or any ALL/Descendents instrumental.So if some girl wounded your heart, buy this. Even if they haven't, this is essential ALL and if it had more songs and continued the cycle of no filler, this would be my favorite All record. This is how pop/punk is supposed to be."
4,CLOSE TO PERFECT,"I had heard a few ALL albums and was unimpressed , i had thought CHAD PRIce was the lead singer all along and i sort of hate that guy, i'm sorry but he's got to be the worst vocalist in punk. Then i heard that ALL had two previous singers before Price and that both of the were better. So i saw this album for 5 bucks so i said what the hell. Man i was blown away by how perfect almost every song is , this album rivals I dont want to grow up by the descendents it's so catchy and Dave Smalley gets exactly what he's supposed to be , he sound slike a tamer Milo which is cool and fits with this music perfectly. ALL the songs are awesome except maybe the instrumental which is kinda lame."
4,"For the money, way too little music","This is typical pop-punk, of which All/Descendents are the true masters. I think Dave Smalley is the singer on this record, who I consider to be the least of All's three lead singers. Nevertheless, he is adequate. And those songs are catchier than a nice fat worm in a fish hatchery.Personally, I think it is outlandish that this record retails for so much, when it is described as an EP."
1,weird dance and not a good workout,"I don't really care for this workout DVD. The style of dance is very different and not something that I'm used to. It's not the typical dance where it breaks down the steps for you and, you follow along and then put it all together at the end. It was more unstructured and you were following her weird dance movements and wasn't even a good workout, you won't break a sweat. I also didn't find the music and costume appealing. In fact, I found the costume so awe full that it distracted from the workout. So far I have done only one workout and probably won't again, I don't recommend it."
5,Im now a lips fan and I love this video collection!,"so what if the vids are a bit low budget? that the charm of the lips and their music is just so much better than most other music out there now. if you're a lips fan, buy it now!"
2,Dissappointing,"For such a creative band, most of the Flaming Lips' videos are incredibly boring. A few are cute, most are lame and cheap, and not worthy of the songs. It's also interesting to see the band using the same tricks throughout their career - hey, let's film a video where we walk through a field at night with a spot light on us. The only difference is that now they have hot chicks hanging around them.So yeah, good songs, bad videos, nice bunny costumes."
1,Dumb,Cool band. worst videos ever. ever. makes me like them less. Fearless Freaks is good. This is garbage....
1,Not what I thought it was going to be.,"This book is not entirely about Diana. It's more about royal princesses in history including Diana. She is mentioned here and there throughout the book, but the cover is deceiving. Too much money to spend on a book that you think is entirely about Diana. Unless you are a history buff, forget it. Diana fans may be disappointed."
5,Django Swings!!,"I didn't think it could get any better then the first JSP boxed set, ""Classic Early Recordings in Chronological Order"", but this new 4 CD Set, ""Vol. 2-Paris & London 1937-48"", takes off right were the other one left. You still get the nice combo of Django's guitar w/ Stephane's violin on a handful of tracks. But with the fresh sound of Hubert Rostaing on Clarinet, your treated to a whole new dimension of Django's music. As a bonus, Django plays solo on a few tracks and his new ensamble with reeds, brass, harmonica and vibes really hits the spot. Tremendous sound quality and clarity. Another great remastering job by the crew at JSP. This collection belongs in everyone's Jazz library, right next to volume 1."
3,just what i asked for!!,book listed as USED AND IN GOOD CONDITION which is just how i received it. no complaints on the product at all.
1,Don't buy this edition!,Detecting Women 2 Pocket Guide (1996) is the older version of Detecting Women Pocket Guide 3rd Edition (1999). Buy the 3rd edition. It's fabulous for keeping track of what you've read. I highly recommend it.
2,Bad user experience,"The package came without a 9V battery or a case. Worse is that the unit displays 000 or 001 no matter the setting of x1, x10, x100... too bad as I needed for my daughter's science project..."
2,Light Meter LX1010B,"Light Meter LX1010B poor tool, not affordable. Arrived used without box and original manual. Useless item. I don't suggest to buy"
4,"Good, But Lacking On The Low End Of The Scale","I found this lux meter to be completely satisfactory in general. What I did not understand from the description is that the lux scale is an integer scale, and the lowest that the meter reads in 1 lux, which is still pretty bright. This is through no fault of the product, but I had hoped for a meter that read fractional lux."
2,Missing items,"I know that a carrying case isn't that big of deal when it comes to a light meter that has a sensor cover...that's not what I'm worried about. I got this product since it was eligible for Prime shipping and needed it the next day, which I got. However, the claim that there would be a 9V battery included is a lie...those things aren't cheap and easy to come by these days so I thought I was getting a good deal. No such luck! Do NOT buy this product."
1,Item didn't work,Item doesn't work.It came in a box shipped from China. The display remains stuck on the numbers 000 or 001 lux.Poor instruction manual and no technical support numbers to call.
2,Stopped Working after 4 Months,"Worked great until it didn't. We used this to check lighting levels in a home. Used it ~ 4 hours one day (Oct 2010). A week later, we used it again for ~ 1 hour. Now, four months after I bought it, I pulled it out and it has stopped working. No screen images, no nothing. I put in a fresh battery, still nothing. Dead! I will buy another brand this time around. Also, I will get a unit that measures in foot-candles, not just lux / lumens."
4,Grow Room Testing ...,This come in handy to check your Lights Patterns and Strenths ...Comes w/ a fairly Nice Carring Case ...
3,It's not the same,"This album isn't bad, but it's just such a tremendous step down from Space in your Face and the debut album that it can earn no more than 3 stars from me.The Galactic Cowboys are an original, talented, and entertaining band, but they've proven that they can write far better material than this. Get Space in your Face first and foremost, and wait on this one unless you're convinced that the Cowboys are for you. They can do better."
4,Another high quality release from an underappreciated band,"GC seem to never get the press they deserve. There are very few bands that mix hard rock with soaring vocals to create the effect that this band does. This disc is one of my favorites of the six I have by them. It took me a while to get into some of the songs, but in retrospect this is one of their most solid releases. ""Evil Twin"" is very typical of the GC sound post 1993. Heavy, singable, very catchy. For me, ""Ribbon"" and ""My Life"" stand above the rest as powerful songs, the latter for some reason reminding me a bit of the last track on the King's X cd ""Ear Candy"". Very introspective and powerful. ""Oregon"", ""Tomorrow"", and ""Mona Lisa"" are also exceptional. Highly recommended."
4,great,"Although i love the entire record, i just have one comment. If you don't start jumping up and down during""Tilt-a-Whirl"", you need to be revived."
4,Solid Effort,Some great songs on this one. Good solid rock band in the style of King's X. Love the song Oregon- awesome.
4,good material bad stitching,"the material is very good cotton, but the stitching of the sweat band is very bad, wasn't worth the trouble of return I could probably stitch it myself and keep it."
2,Disappointed,"I bought these for workouts - keeping sweat out of my eyes. These looked good when arrived and fit nicely. The band is padded, not a feature I really wanted but could deal with. After the first washing/drying in cold water and low heat, these drastically shrank. Now they are a tight fit on my size 7-1/8"" melon, and the tie strings are just barely long enough to tie a shoelace knot. Why wouldn't the manufacturer wash the fabric before assembly? I'll be chucking these and seeking replacements."
4,very nice... love it,"riding in the winter months down in the south east of our fair nation, i use a balaclavato keep my head and neck warm and have gotten used to the fit and feel of something onmy head under the helmet... the helmet feels a little looser with a naked head underthe helmet... tried just using an old bandana i had and it just din't feel that greatplus ya have to muck with the bandana little too much when yer putting it on after havinghad it on, reshaping it and all... so thought i'd go on a search for a 'head wrap' andcame across this and others on amazon... put my decision on this one and another... thisparticular one feels great under the helmet and no big deal taking it off and putting itback on... highly recommend!"
5,Great!,"I wear this almost every ride. I'll look for one with a POW or Freedom flag on it. Fits perfect, remember to tie it tight for the side gusts of wind!"
3,Not really one size,Maybe elastic will make this truly one size. If you have lots of hair like I do and wear a poony tail it does not fit well and slides off when removing my helmet.
3,Decent Material but poorly manufactured unit,"The material seems heavy weight and strong, the product itself though is poorly stitched and is actually not symmetric. It is quite a bit lopsided.It does not matter under the helmet, and the product performs adequately although I doubt it will last very long."
4,Still worth reading,"I wanted to get the book mostly because of the interesting title, but found it very thought-provoking, still, after some 20 years since it's written. Many things that I have read in other writings by Doris Lessing, but still, very much worth reading."
2,This is a very boring book,"Although this book has some decent thoughts about humans, and how we act in our daily lives, it is VERY VERY BORING. She repeats the exact same thoughts over and over again, using some in all of the five lectures. I found myself struggling to stay awake during my reading."
4,A must Read!!!,"I love Doris Lessing! I have read many of her works of fiction but, I am new to her essays. I was blown away by her honest ""bird's eye view "" of our world. She has the insight to look around us and truely see what the world has become and how we got here. Her points are simple yet, seem to escape most of us. Reading Prisions will give a first time reader the oppertunity to experience the witt and prose of a master. After finishing try The Fifth Child!"
3,"Streamlined Look, Same Rice Cooking Functions","The sturdy, stainless steel appearance of this model hides some design flaws. Foremost, the glass lid is ill-fitting on the base pot, providing lots of leeway for steam to escape during cooking. Secondly, the bell mechanism is, frankly, an overrated feature here. The sound produced is far too quiet for it to be practical in a busy kitchen. Despite these two shortcomings, the two stainless steel steaming baskets are very useful, and the Breville RC19XL succeeds best in its most important task: cooking rice to perfection. Overall, a not-too-pricey cost for a modern design and general practicality."
1,Burnt Rice,I purchased this rice cooker about a year ago & ever since then we have been getting burnt or crunchy rice. I've followed the directions several times still with the same results. I've even had my mother-in-law see if she could get it to work and still no luck. So she went out and bought a tiny Rival for cheap at wally world & it works WAY better then this one. Which was just a tad more expensive. Soooo I'll be looking for a different. Sigh
3,Burn me baby,"This cooker cooks rice but has a tendency to slightly burn the rice. If you cook partly milled or brown rice you will have to adjust the amount of water added. All these ""features"" I can deal with, but the warm and hold part is not good. If you try and keep the rice warm, it will burn after a short time. I have seen other rice cookers that will hold the rice warm for several hours without burning."
5,Excellent for sensitive skin!,"This is the only brand of bandages that doesn't irritate my sensitive skin at all. They still stick just as well as the other guys, too."
3,"Part 1 fabulous, Part 2 disjointed","Part 1 of this episode is classic Indy. It has intrigue, Indy's unique problem solving, historic accuracy, and a wonderful sense of humor in its representation of the spoiled aristocratic brothers. Part 2 is set in beautiful St. Petersburg Russia and captures the excitement of the revolution (reminiscent of Reds) but is either not as well written or not as well edited as it could be. The course of Indy's relationship with his revolutionary roommates does not develop naturally and left me feeling that there must be important scenes sitting on the cutting room floor."
1,don't waste your money,"Really disappointing and total waste of money. You'd do better not testing at all to be honest. The color change is so hard to see. With the failure rate, there is almost no point to use this test because you have to wonder if your results are in the failure rate or accurate.Go with a professional test or hope scope instead."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"Ok well I was lucky enough to purchase this product on clearance at Walgreens & after reading the reviews I can see why it was on clearance!!I did the test EXACTLY like it said, no mistakes....but the color came back NOTHING like it was suppose to be (teal???)WTF!! Very hard to read & believe!!! I really dont think this test is accurate & I think its a waste of money & time...Save your money & have the doctor do the test if your concerned about your partners sperm count cause this test will NOT give you the answers your looking for!!!"
3,only checks count,"other issues may be there like motility (more common than count).Better off just getting to your Dr, unless you wanted a prep run."
2,breaking the surface,I am having a hard time finishing reading this book. How can a superstar athlete be such a wimp?It just turned me off. I hope he has turned his life around.
5,One of the most heart-felt and sincere books yet.,"Greg has written a book that is touching the hearts of so many people. As a young college student, I myself have had to overcome my sexuality and my HIV status. I finally met Greg on February 15th at the University of Miami, and it reinforced the idea of what a wonderful person he is. Greg's book is definitely one in a million. It's a must read for gays and straights, and people who are HIV positive and negative. His strength is capable of helping all of us live a more productive life... and to be happy with ourselves."
5,I cried.,This has to be one of the best books I've ever read. The honesty and the detail is amazing. If we could all be as honest and open the World would be a great place.
5,a heart-wrenching account of one of America's Olympic heroes,Greg Louganis should be applauded for his autobiography. With each word he portrays his turbulent life that no one even could have imagined during the Olympics. This book is definitely one of the best autobiographies I have ever read.
3,Very interesting,"Easy read, but at times I thought... did he invent the internet too? Seems he has done everything including moving an Olympic Volley Ball Site. But a good look into his life which was not always the mose pleasant."
5,Archos 504,"Purchased this item as a storage solution for digital photos. The item is easy to use, allows easy acces to all photos, and provides a large viewing area for the photos. It is large enough to view the pictures without a magnifying glass, yet small enough for a woman to carry in her purse. It raises the term ""Brag Book"" to the electronic age."
5,One of my favorites!,"Super versatile. Awesome feel, control and rebound. Of the many sticks I own these are one of my faves. Just awesome."
4,Nice sticks.,"I like these sticks and there is not a thing wrong with them. They just don't feel as comfortable as some of my other sticks, but you will never know until you try something different."
1,Jesus would have been appalled,"This book celebrates conversions to an organization that oppresses people every day, cutting them off from essential parts of their nature and advocating covert hatred of anyone not of the same beliefs--and all this in the name of quite probably the greatest, most accepting sage of all time. Not acceptable."
2,"Readable, but not entirely convincing-Vol 1 is MUCH better","Okay, I admit it, I was taken in by the advertising hype on this one. They made it seem as though it was just like volume one.It is NOT anything like the first volume.The stories are not written (or edited) very well. But what is worse -- the reasons for converting to the Catholic Church are NOT presented in a convincing manner, except maybe for one or two chapters.If you purchase this book, PLEASE DO NOT SHARE IT WITH NON-CATHOLICS. Not only will it leave most of them unconvinced, even worse, it will make it easier for them (and anti-Catholics) to explain away conversions to Catholicism in purely psychological terms.The problem with any sequel is that it invites comparisons. In this case, unfortunately, that bodes ill for future volumes. Do us all a favor, Mr. Madrid, and cut your losses."
2,Disappointment,"Although I am a Catholic, I found this book to be a bit disappointing. There are a few good sections but overall it seems to lack depth into the conversion stories - I suppose I was looking for something closer to Born Fundamentalist Born Again Catholic by David Currie."
4,Great,"This book is really good and will help many Catholics become stronger in their faith and will really surprise Protestants. (It also has an former poor-choicer, a Jew, and a Wiccan.) It lost 1 star because most of these stories you can find for free on the web, and I had read about half of them without knowing it before buying the book."

5,solid and stylish turner,nice thin edge on this turner so that you can flip your eggs without tearing them.
3,"It's ok, but........",my wife hates it. It is too long for her and the head of it is wider than we though. She is looking for a smaller one so I am keeping my eyes open.
5,All - Descendents style punk,"Melodic punk from SoCal. Similar in style to All or the Descendents. Snotty vocals. And a fixation on porn stars. In fact, these guys did some soundtrack work for the Dark Brothers that is fantastic! Fuzzy instrumental rock. Check it out !"
4,Nice but...,"I bought this watch in 2006. I fell in love with it, but it was way too small. Just like the previous reviewer mentioned - you kinda need glasses to know what time it is. I had to give it away to my kid sister."
5,The most comprehensive/user freindly telephone triage book.,"When it came time to select a book to use as a guideline for triage assessment, I searched through 15 books and a couple of computerized systems. This book is the easiest to follow, without being too simplistic. The format is exceptional and key questions are clear, concise and still open-ended enough to prevent ""leading"" your patient. There are cross-references for each complaint, as well as home care measures for each ailment. The final points are the blank formatted pages for writing your own protocols, and tracking charts to complete QA. 5 stars hardly seem enough!"
5,Excellent Book,"If the armed forces uses it and bases their clinical practice guidelines on it, it's got to be good, right? It is. I use this book in nurse telephone triage for a military pediatric clinic with 2700 patients. The book is spiral bound and easy to flip pages, and the pages stay open to the topic you are using. Topics are alphabetized which saves time when searching for a certain topic. There is a very useful table of contents at the front. The home care instructions are straight forward and acceptable to our parents. It doesn't have all the topics you would need (that's what pediatricians are for), but tab topics you use most, add a drug book and a pediatrician, and you're ready to go."
5,"Spectacular ! A ""Must Have"" Reference !","This book is exactly what every health care professional needs when performing a quick yet thorough triage assessment. When telephone triage phone time is limited and you need information FAST .... this book meets the demand for knowledge. You just can't pass this one up .... can also beneficial to those performing ""face-to-face"" triage assessments. The author did a GREAT job with this !!!"
5,A Superb Alien Conspiracy Film,"The dramatic story of intelligence officer Jesse Marcel's controversial quest to determine if a UFO actually crashed outside of Roswell, New Mexico, in the summer of 1947, and whether or not the government engaged in a massive cover up.This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I would not even bother renting it. For (very little) you can own this spectacular documentary that will keep you guessing at what really happened in Roswell. It's a must see film."
4,Great movie!,"Although I haven't read the book, I think this is a very good movie. It was well written and Kyle MacLachlan has a great presence as Jesse Marcel. I just think the make-up, trying to make Kyle look older, could be better."
3,THEY'RE OUT THERE,"The Roswell story has been an interesting piece of ""urban legend"" for some time now. Did our government conspire to cover up the supposed crash landing of an alien spaceship? We'll never really know the truth, I'm sure. ROSWELL is an intriguing movie, although it lacks any real suspense and since we know how it ends, one is left with what is basically a character study of Jesse, the soldier who was humiliated and promoted in order to keep his mouth shut. Kyle MacLachlan, one of our most underrated actors, gives a solid, sturdy performance, even though his makeup conjures up images of Brad Dourif. Martin Sheen's enigmatic character makes an appearance at the end of the film, but we never know who he is. Dwight Yoakam does well as the farmer who first discovers the wreckage. However, only MacLachlan's character is developed fully enough to care about. A clean, clinical and provocative movie; just not a great one."
5,RVD is the whole F'n' show,"enough said just watch this dvd and you agree too this must have in your collection of hardcore wrestling fans,"
4,"Great DVD, but where is RVD?","I love this DVD with a great hardcore matche with Sabu and Jeff Hardy. I also loved his match with Evil Chris Jericho at the VERY LAST King of the Ring. What I mean by ""where's RVD"" is that RVD has been gone since Januray 2005 and he hasn't been seen since (Well during the ECW ppv and as the Last RAW draft pick). Last time we saw him was on SMACKDOWN when Danny Basham hit his ""So CALLED"" bad leg with the steel steps. He's had worst injuries then that. Every RVD website I go to doesn't have any updates on RVD's (so called) bad knee. Anyway this is one of the coolist WWE dvds."
5,Amazon Release TNA!,"Total Nonstop Action Wrestling has made some amazing ppv's like Victory Road, Turning Point, Final Resolution, and Against All Odds. Amazon I'm begging you to put TNA DVD's on your site as well as WWE DVD's."
4,Great DVD for wrestling fans in general,"The other reviews here have match listings and basic summaries of this DVD, so I'll just skip over that. If you enjoy Rob Van Dam's matches today or during his ECW stint, definately buy this DVD. A lot of these matches are very good (vs.Jerry Lynn, vs.Sabu, vs.Jeff Hardy), but there are a few that are nothing special. The two WCW matches are certainly not cant-miss material, though they are somewhat entertaining. The extras are also fun if you haven't seen them before, or want to revisit those segments and promos. The only wrestling fans I wouldn't recommend this DVD to are the ones who don't like hardcore wrestling at all. This DVD is full of that, especially in the ECW matches."
5,Do You Have Time to Burn?,"As an embittered ECW fan, I don't watch Raw or Smackdown so I haven't seen an RVD match in a few years. But watching this DVD, I was taken aback at how insane the WWE crowd is for Van Dam. And I'm going to love it when his underpromoted DVD (it's nowhere to be found in ANY store in Los Angeles!) outsells that of every other overpushed wrestler in Vince's family circus. What will Van Dam get for his efforts? I'm guessing a year long feud with Rudy Diamond -- where he loses. And we'll get more diet books from Triple HGH. BTW, The Rise and Fall of ECW is going to pass WMXX as the best selling DVD in WWE history. It's these small victories that keeps me from swallowing a gallon of Liquid Plumber . . . . Super Strength."
5,Cyan cartridge for the Epson 3800,"Since Amazon's description is too abbreviated, this is the Cyan cartridge for the Epson 3800."
2,Oh Where's My Money?,"Saints and Friends, after listening to this project I've been asking myself questions. Why do I do this? Why do I buy worship CDs and expect them to be good? I assumed anybody named DeAndre would know how to take me higher but this CD does nothing but leave me flat and wondering if I can sell this on eBay. I'll give props for the Mama June medleys and maybe one other, but that's just 'cause I'm being polite. Save your money and buy this used."
4,I had my doubts but ...,"I suffer from back and neck pain and working 10 hours a day on a computer does not help.I do agree that the first 20 minutes in this chair are very uncomfortable.But I chalked that up to years of sitting in correctly and my body not liking how it issupposed to sit. After a few days of getting used to it, I will never use anything but thistype of chair. My neck and back feel great!"
1,AWFUL PRODUCT,"After a few weeks of using this product, the 'foam' totally flattened, so all the pressure was up against the wood directly. To add insult....the product snapped and broke, pinning my ankles under the chair...very painful. I would definitely not recommend buying this product."
1,Great way to waste money,"I agree with the other reviewers - this chair will fall apart within a couple months. You will have to keep tightening screws, etc. so the pads stay on, and in my case, the bottom part for the knees simply snapped. So now I have a useless piece of junk. I ordered from Cross Country Furniture - and I absolutely DO NOT recommend them as a party to do business with. Slow, unresponsive, and very unfriendly... Plus, they're selling junk products like this chair. Save your money."
2,Bad business people,"I am a teacher and work in the Suburbs of Chicago. I thought it would be helpful to be wheeling around the classroom inbetween the kids while we would be in reading groups. However, the chair was cracked. So I called and sent it back. But never received a penny for my return. I even PAID for the return shipping.I spoke with the old man several times and he never did keep his word to return the money. Oh and get this there was a ""20%-30% return fee"" on something that was broken in the first place.I do not recommend doing business with this company.Highly dissatisfied teacher!Clara"
4,Pleasant enough,"Another wonderfully written book by Barbara Bretton. The storyline is about a mother (Rose)-daughter(Maddy) relationship that is fraught with misunderstandings and distance. Despite having lived apart for many years now, Maddy moves back to her hometown and takes a job working alongside her mother. The story follows the two women through this transition and we see Rose and Maddy get to know each other once again, partly because of Hannah, Maddy's young daughter. Instead of a romance taking senter stage, the relationship between the mothers and daughters is at the forefront and th romance is slim to none, really. The book was well-written although a bit far-fetched in terms of realism. Maddy and her family are linked with another local family, the O'Malley's, through a teapot and a dying matriarch. There was a bit of supernatural involved with tat part of the story and that detracted from it somewhat, but overall it was a good read and well worth the time."
3,A good tale that ended too soon,"I read ""Shore Lights"" on the suggestion of a friend. The book sucked me in and held my attention right until the end ... and at that point I wondered what happened to the rest of the story. Throughout the book, Rose makes many references to all these ideas that she has to share with her daughter Maddy, and that just never comes to fruition. The book ends on a happy note, but I just felt it wasn't finished. The author alluded to much more. I was left wondering if there was a sequel (and hoping that there was because I liked the characters and the setting very much). I would recommend this book to other readers (it's great ""beach reading""), but don't be surprised if you're not disappointed at the abrupt end."
5,Outstanding!,"If you are looking for escapism, this is the book for you! The development of characters and story line made this one of the best written books I've read in quite a while. Could hardly put the book down. Have ordered the follow-up book, ""Chances Are"" on Kindle and can't wait to start reading it tonight."
2,Not her best,"I have enjoyed reading Mrs. Bretton in the past. Her work can bring tears and smiles. BUT I have to say that SHORE LIGHTS was not her best work. I was expecting to read a story about Maddy and Aidan learning to find love again. Maddy and Her mother finding each other again (or maybe for the first time). Sadly I found the start of the book to be really slow and full of tons of information that in truth just took up space. Once the story starts to pick up and all the characters are dealing with all these new feels and learning to trust and love again the story takes a really weird twist. Maddy's daughter is some how connected to Aidans 101 yr.old grandmother and the connection is a Samvar.I will read Bretton again, but this one will be on my 'miss' list. If the idea of a 101 yr. old women speaking through a four year old by magic powers of the tea pot then you might want to hold out on this one as well."
2,Most songs are not the original studio recordings,"I think this CD collection is a gross misrepresentation of the songs contained within. Nowhere is it made clearly obvious that the majority of the songs are RE-recordings. Only once I began playing the CDs did I realize something wasn't right, and upon looking at the list of tracks on the CD, I noticed a tiny footnote indicating that certain tracks (at least one third) are RE-recordings or LIVE recordings. When one buys a CD of ""popular music"", one expects to hear the same songs they were accustomed to hearing over the radio. To me, the few original tracks in this collection don't make it worth purchasing an entire 8-CD collection, so I ended up returning it for a refund. As a footnote, this could explain why the collection is relatively inexpensive, since most of the recordings are not the original versions...."
4,Best of Mona Van Duyn,"I picked this poetry collection to read for a class I am taking. At first I dreaded this because I dislike reading poetry, however I found myself hooked. It was very interesting to see how Mona's writing changed from her first collection in 1959 to the collection written in 1993. You can see the changes in society, from society's view of being very conservative to discussing the issues of abortion and homosexuality.I live in Missouri, so I found it easy to relate to her discription of the environment and of her garden.Her words are beautiful and I highly recommend you read this."
3,mixed emotions,"The DVD would not run in my DVD player but it would on my PC's DVD player. On my computer screen the resolution was pretty poor. I could not see the strings Dan was playing - also partly because he is holding his bass somewhat sideways. You will also hear airplanes taking off during his lessons. Mmmm, would you record music in a place like that? However, the content of the DVD is surely complete. You'll start with scales and go from there. Pretty dry really especially compared to the Murphy method which does work on my Tv's player and also is better presented.The first section could have been better by taking the video of the tripod.My recommendation would be to get several videos on paying bass and if you want to start playing pretty much right out of the box the Murphy method is going to get you there first, but the are lots of things on this video that are not covered on the Murphy video so get both."
3,If you have a good sense of humor about Lutheran theology . . .,"A humorous and somewhat irreverent look at theology, with a particular poke directed toward Lutheran theologians. Martin Marty, a highly respected scholar and Lutheran, started the ""Bibfeldt Tradition"" with classmates while a student at Concordia Seminary, St. Louis. While enjoyable, the reader needs to meet several pre-requisites to best enjoy (understand) the Bibfeldt Tradition. First, the ability to read out loud without embarrassment; second, a knowledge of theology and theologians; third, knowing at least one academic theologian; and fourth, an ability to enjoy theology with a rib (not the bones, either)."
1,False Advertising,"First off, THERE IS NO FULL FRONTAL MALE NUDITY in this movie none WHATSOEVER so don't be fooled by the tag! Just a navel gazing exercise! Four people EXPLAINING sexuality. (I get all that even whilst FForwarding through the entire film!) It's that boring! But then again how often does something like ""Another Gay Movie"" come along? If the cover makes you curious rent it and do same - Fast forward through. Not even worth the time."
4,Lovely Book for Children of all ages,"This is a lovely book about the wonderful world of ballet dancing. Exploring all aspects of going to a professional dance school and clearly illustrating the hard work involved and all the joys that go with it. Nine year old Jennifer desperately wants to dance at the National Ballet School in Toronto, Canada. Though she is rejected, kept on hold and told she won't make it, she is persistant and comes to surprise everyone by making it in and becoming a very accomplished dancer."
3,get to the point,"I was a little disappointed as I felt the explanation part of the DVD went way too slow and long to keep my interest, and by the time it got to the point of just doing the whole routine with no explanation interruption, it only took about 10 minutes and it was over. I was hoping for a little more fun and excitment, I was a little bored. I'll probably pass it on to someone like my mom, who would probably get some fun out of it. Also, it was difficult to determine what chakra we were working on at any given time."
4,THE OUT TAKES FROM MOTHER FOCUS,"IT IS APPARENT THAT JAN AKKERMAN WAS LEAVING FOCUS. THEARE SOME GOOD TRACKS,BUT WHEN YOU LISTEN AS WITH MOTHERFOCUS IT IS ALL JAN AKKERMAN. THE U.S. VERSION OF HOCUSPOCUS IS A TOTAL KNOCKOUT! WORTH BUYING FOR THESE RARE TRACKS. RECOMMENDED."
5,In a word-Amazing,This is one of the funniest and best of CDs I have been privilaged enough to own. I would recomend this band to anyone who likes a bit of offbeat humor with their rock.
5,Sound choice has the BEST Quality karaoke tracks in my opinion!!!,This is a multiplex CD with 2 versions of each song.

5,Many Features,"Length:: 1:51 MinsThis is a short video that will help you to understand & appreciate the effort and life that was poured into making ""Spirits Among Us"" via cut away stills and video clips. I think the info in this video review will be helpful in deciding whether to purchase this DVD or not. This is one of those DVD's where the bonus features are just as interesting & entertaining as the film itself! NOTE: Because there are scary elements in this movie, it may not be suitable for younger audiences (elements explained in video review).Check out this reviewer's other video reviewsWhat IfStanding FirmPilgrim's Progress: Journey to HeavenBandslam(may have to scroll down thru other reviews)"
1,spirts among us,very bad acting. very difficult to set thru because the movie was so slow and not interesting. not scary. not worth buying
1,the worst spirit movie on dvd,"This dvd movie is so stupid, I rate a grade F if I was grading it like homework. This movie put me to sleep it didn't keep in suspense and the actors need more trainging on there acting careers. This move wasn't worth spending a penny on it but there will be other people who will like it but that is ok I don't care for this and I felt I waisted my money"
4,Wonderful Collection,"This book is definately worth owning. It is a collection of all Dorothy Parker's short stories and poems. The book itself is a wonderful value, being hardcover, and containing so much of Parker's work. The poems and short stories are cunnignly written, with a sharp sense of humor and reality. A common theme in these stories is the battle of the sexes, where Dorothy Parker's unparalleled sarcasm brings lighthearted humor to the quarrels between men and women. Always she writes with quick wit and stunning realism. The poems are meant to be read again and again, which is why I reccomend buying the book instead of renting from a library. Enjoy!"
3,Best for devoted fans and scholars,My 3-star rating reflects an attempt to average the very uneven contents. Some very excellent pieces contrast with others that have not aged well. The monologues and soliloquies in particular among the stories read today as rather quaint; far from their contemporary impact as so very original. Some pieces have mainly scholarly interest; fewer hold up to the standard of being entertaining to a modern audience. The poems are more successful in this regard. Although the poems are best sampled in small nibbles as there are very many and by-and-large very much like their fellows.
4,Good book,I bought this book so that it would help my son who just started learing french. But I totally missed a point. My son asked me how is he going to sound the words and I had no clue. Do not buy it if you are beginner as an audio version would be better.
5,Rabbit in the Moon,A fascinating first hand account on just what it must have been like to be in an internment camp. I had no idea of the scope of this and how many were interred. Needless to say it wasn't talked about much in school in the 60's. What an embarrassing mark on our history.
2,Misleading advertising,"The product description is inaccurate. It should clearly state in the heading for the ""Bronze Storm Window Clamps"" that they are made of plastic not as is implied bronze metal."
3,Meh.,"The only drawback for this mattress as stated in previous reviews is that the pump has to be charged before use, which sucks the spontaneity out of having an air mattress around, but I've had mine for 4 years and its just now starting to leak a bit. This is after years of extended family visits in which everyone had a good nights rest on it. My husband and I have slept peacefully on this thing and for the price, its a good deal. However, now we're ""upgrading"" to an Aerobed since having an extra bed around has been invaluable for us and we've decided it was worth the investment. But for occasional, PLANNED visitors, I say yeah, buy it."
1,"Can't review, I never got the book!","This was my first disappointment in dealing with Amazon. I oredered the book (used) and it never arrived. I never recieved notice that it was unavaliable or not being sent, only a refund on my credit card. I realize that Amazon isn't responsible for second hand sources and this will certainly not deter me from ordering from Amazon in the future, but I needed the book and was disappointed that it never arrived."
2,not great,I can't say this really works. I seem to have the same amount of dust as before i purchased this.
2,"Not Quite ""State Of The Art"" As I Expected","After sampling their ""All Creation Sings"" tune from the Numavox website, I thought that the AD album it came from would have more of the same kind of energetic rocking style that was put into that one song, but unfortunately it doesn't: the other songs sound painfully weak and don't really measure up to that one track which is the opener of this album. That's really sad, considering that in 1999 another former member of Kansas would have a Christian rock album that truly sounds like it belongs in the 1980s in a very good way, alongside acts such as Yes, Asia, Boston, and Pink Floyd to name a few popular rock bands of that era."
1,Art of the State,"I bought this CD after reading the many glowing reviews on Amazon. What are these people smoking? This is the most gawdawful piece of crap I have ever listened to...and coming from an individual whose work I deeply respected and utterly adored in Kansas. Boring composition, unimaginative playing, whining amateurish vocals...just stay from this stinker!!!"
4,"Packed with information, but difficult to read","David Healy obviously knows a lot about antidepressants (and about psychopharmacology in general). However, he apparently doesn't know a lot about using clear, straightforward, unpretentious language.This book badly needs an editor. Healy's writing is far more difficult and opaque than it needs to be.Nevertheless, I'm giving the book four stars because of the excellent content."
3,History and Hysteria,"I wish I had done better in Symbolic Logicbefore drawing conclusions from this book.Fortunately, my experience and that of myfriends', has been an adequateguide in the midst of political, socioeonomic, andideological wars that his work inspires.I am a pragmatist at heart. Dr. Healy is a good historianof psychiatry. This is a very well-researchedbook on the evolution of antidepressanttreatment. But I think I would rather haveDr. Healy as a professor than as a doctor.Squiggles"
4,Cool dope music,"I love the movie and like the rap songs on this album. R&B songs are not so good. I was hoping to hear ""Good Girl Bad Guys"" from DMX on this album, but it was not there."
2,A little too long,"I am a fan of Donald Harington. That said, this book was a little too long and drawn out. It borders on boring. I must be spoiled on the ""Stay More"" series. They are great and this is not. I will stick with ""Stay More"" only."
5,My favorite ghost story...,"My favorite ghost story is SOME OTHER PLACE, THE RIGHT PLACE. It is sexy, funny, sad, and wise. The story is about a college girl who happens reads a newspaper story about high school boy who, under hypnosis, has been channeling a ghost -- the ghost of her grandfather! She and the boy begin an odyssey, visiting all the ghost towns where the ghost used to live. Naturally the boy falls in love with the girl -- but she falls in love with the ghost who emerges in the boy when he is under hypnosis, so this becomes one strange love triangle. This book and THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE ARKANSAS OZARKS by the same author are the two books I most often give away to my friends."
5,Oldie but Goody,"I read this book when it was first released in 1972, and recently reread it. In my opinion, it help up well over the last 40 years."
5,Suhwanging,"Hell yes. This is music to make you wish you lived somewhere other than Oregon. Severely swinging, grooving, moving. Big ups for the piano player."
2,Wamble is the Real Deal,"Having been enjoying Country Libations for the month or so I had the pleasure of hearing him live. Doug is one of those players that it will take a while for it to sink in as to how great a player he is, only because we had so much fun listening to him.I picked up the CD because I heared Doug was a wicked slide guitarist and I found out he is much more. Doug's leadership and songwriting brings together players, Roy Dunlap, Jeff Hanley, and Peter Miles (all players who stand on their own) and exploits his and thier strengths in an Ellinton-esque way.If Doug sticks to the original way he fuses (without being fusion) styles that emerges with a style of his own all good music fans will be blessed forever.Let it be, Doug strong debut is just the surface of a deep journey that jazz, country, gospel, blue and etc fans will have the pleasure to experience. So much invention, soul and passion in an accessible sound. Support great music, and buy his CD."
2,not impressive,"I bought this CD because its on Branford's label. the best part of the CD is Branford's soprano sax solo on Walking on the Moon, which isn't the greatest song to begin with and doesn't really go anywhere. Wamble's voice is not impressive. At best he sounds a little like Col. Bruce Hampton, at worst like a white guy trying to sing blues. Wamble's guitar playing is OK, nothing incredible. I do think this artist has potential to eventually develop something unique. I don't think he's there yet"
1,Not Much,"I would say that if you like this cd, you should check out Leon Redbone. He does the traditional stuff in a much more personal way, and for my money, is much more of an artist on the guitar, and his sense of humor and knowledge of the old make him a one of a kind."
2,"Little less singin', a little more pickin'","Doug Wamble plays pretty good guitar, but somebody apparently told him he could sing and he believed them. As a singer, he's a dandy guitar player, and ought to stick to that. His vocal tone is whiny and wavering, and he frequently sings out of his natural range. The album is an odd blend of jazz, blues, and gospel that never quite gels into a solid whole. The sidemen play well, though I'm not enamored of violinist Charles Burnham's scratchy and restricted tone. All in all, this is a disappointment primarily due to the preponderance of sub-par vocals."
5,hot damn!,"if you like the works of daniel clowes then this graphic novel will have you flipping page after page. this girl (fabulously named ""bee"") lives in brooklyn and works at a photoshop developing pictures. one day she gets a batch of suspicious pictures from a famous russian photographerand soon she is hot on what seems to bea murder case. jason little pours some of his best skills into the one. definatly something to share with your friends."
4,Click Click,"A graphic novel, but for an older audience. About a gal that works in a photo developing place who gets involved in a mystery when she develops some pictures of dead people. I liked it. You can check out some of Little's work online, just google him."
4,Excellent classic Christmas music,"If you like Emmey Lou Harris, Dolly Parton, Neil Young or Ricky Skaggs this is a must-have holiday music album! Recorded in the 1970's I cannot believe I didn't hear this earlier. The vocals are out of this world! Thanks to Public Radio, this may become my favorite Christmas music."
2,What Went Wrong?,"I LOVE the Great Songmistress; who sung well here. As to everything else despite all the obvious care for inputs, the product misfires. Some odd material of a vanity nature as well as melodic innovations. Too shrill--unlike Blue Kentucky Girl of the same year or so. Accompianying singer on the left side had a broken microphone--or the entire remastering was done from flaky tape--making for annoying high pitched sandpapery grinding ruining duets and intruding throughout. Tape was oversaturated maybe from the beginning? Rhino Records has fixed these kinds of problems in the past, but in its decline did not here. Nobody listened to the pre-release. Off to where disks go to die, the Tin Ear Bin of a charity."
3,Can't seem to decide if it is haunted or not.,"I love Barbara Michaels but this isn't one of her best efforts. Andrea inherits a run down old Victorian mansion. She is almost broke and responsible for her youmg adult brother who has just lost a leg in a car accident. She decides to turn the house into a bed and breakfast to support them. Jim, the brother, forms a strange attachment to the house. Is there a presence from a past resident or two interacting with them? Seems to be so, but they don't mean any harm, do they? The ending may surprise you."
2,Depressing,"I usually enjoy this author's work, but found this particular story depressing. I favor light books with a sprinkling of strife, not the other way around. It is seldom that I wish I hadn't wasted my time reading a book, but this was definitely a waste of time for me."
1,Awful!,"I was halfway through this book and wanted to throw it against the wall, it was that bad. I have read her works before, and they were very good -- but not this one. It was not scary at all. The heroine was very unlikeable--in fact everyone was. I was definitely very disappointed in this book."
2,Satan. What a funny name for a cat.,"After having read the book's synopsis, I thought that it sounded terrifying . . . BUT ALL WASN'T AS IT SEEMED!! I hate Ms Michaels for misleading me to believe that the book was scary. I would hardly call a FEW ODD MOMENTS scary. Please fellow readers, don't read this book if you're looking for something frightening, rather read it if you want to witness how a newly disabled brother (Jim) copes and relates with his overprotective sister (Andrea) and a newly found friend (Martin). If there was anything I liked about the story, it would have to be the constant bickering between Andrea and Martin.And Jim's verbal lash-outs at Andrea just adds to the turmoil of the story."
2,SLOW,"I'm sorry, I don't like giving negative reviews, however this book is so slow. I am halfway through and still waiting for something to happen.? There is a hint of a ghost story barely forming around the edges, but at this point I have lost all interest. And as mentioned by another reviewer, the main character of this story is stodgy, annoyed by everyone and everything, ungrateful and just put out in general. She treats her 19 year old brother as if he were a 10 year old. I'm unsure why he tolerates it other than he reads like a young teen?.This book might have a good ending, just not sure if I will bother finding out."
2,Eh...,"I read this book a long time ago when I was just a teenager, and now again at age 32. I liked it a lot better when I was young, before age and experience honed my tastes for good novels. My latest read brought forth much that was lacking in this novel. For a woman who is running a haunted Bed & Breakfast, her attitude is horrible. Come to think of it, her attitude is horrible throughout the whole novel. Perpetually feeling sorry for herself, jealous of her brother's friends and against most of his ambitious undertakings, nasty to her most dependable customer (and most likeable character, I might add) who is there throughout the story, and finding most of her customers disagreeable to some extent (even the nice ones!). I agree you have to be tough in business, but I think she takes it to the extreme. I was disappointed in my second read - as I had, until now, fond memories of the book. Hopefully this won't deter me from reading other books from my past."
2,Defective merchandise and customer service,"I purchased this item from Polstein Home and Beyond. It was defective upon receipt, only one side of the breaker had any continuity. I called the merchant and explained the situation and the fact that I have no heat or air conditioning until the breaker is replaced. I was assured that a replacement would be sent right away and a FedEx return tag would be emailed to me to return the defective unit. The return tag was received, I boxed up the defective merchandise and sent it out, anxiously awaiting the replacement. Approximately one week later I received a notice that my charge card had been credited for the return. I never did receive the replacement and had to purchase one from another vendor."
3,Smooth Bossa,"This group is new to me, but their music speaks for itself. Nice, smooth bossa-nova rhythms is great background music for any occasion."
1,DBZ hits rock bottom...,"The movies peaked with Brolly - Legendary Super Saiyan and have sharply declined in both story quality and action ever since. I only finished watching this film out of sheer morbid curiosity and was sorry I did so. This movie did not add to the series in any way, shape, or form. Yeah, I am aware that it is supposed to be funny, but they usually balance comedy with action, but this movie just stunk. Trunks and Goten are ok in small doses, but this was just too much. Fortunately there is a light at the end of the tunnel - Wrath of the Dragon is awsome (I have seen the Japanese version) and I look forward to them ending the US release of the series on a good note."
2,well it was short,okay umm what the hell broly movie part1 was the best i got this when it first came out i have all the dbz movies but this one was too short just like the second part. But why could'nt they put more action in it and the ending in this one sucked when i saw it i was like what thats it evan if the dbz movie is uncut its still a little to short like bio broly broly second coming lord slug and coolers revenge i have them uncut and they were great but a little to short but otherwise this was not really great.
1,Bio awful,I found this movie rather weak. I was expecting alot more action from this movie especially with the Dragon Ball Z series. I strongly recommend to everyone and anyone interested in buying this DVD title to save their money and purchase something worth the cash. I honestly can't describe the depth of dissapointment with this movie. You'd think with the legendary super sayian there would be more intensity to the fight.
3,2nd worse of the lot,"What happened? Broly went from being one of the best Movie Villians to this garbage. It boggles the mind why but lets continue.Bio Broly is about Mr. Satan having to face an old martial arts buddy from his past. 18 follows to collect from the World Martial Arts tournament as does Goten and Trunks. One of the Bio Warriors is Broly (who is only 1/2 done) and decides to destroy them. Goten, Trunks, 18, and Krillian battle him and eventually get the better. In the end they find Bio Broly 1 weakness, and well it was pathetic.I know most fans probably would have prefered a movie that revolved around the events in Hell at the end of the movie (Goku and Pikon go down to stop him but we don't see that) but sadly that is not the case.Worse only beaten by Super Android 13."
1,Definitely a Rental,"Simply put, this movie shames the Dragonball Z genre.This movie has a very poor plot, uninspiring music, lacks drama or emotion, and could be entertaining to only the youngest of children at best.Avoid this film and, perhaps, send a message to funimation to stop putting out garbage."
2,Not a good Movie but is bearable,"I watched the japanese version of movie and there is no Goku,gohan,trunks,piccolo etc except #18, Krillin , Chibi Trunks and Chibi Goten.Script is simple with the blood that fell from broly's body during the last battle scientists were able to create a clone with the help of a millionare who wished to defeat Mr. Satan and the end is pathetic and moreover u dont see the face of Broly in the whole movie except for start as he's covered with mud and green leaves all the time.Also its bearable only if u are a real die hard DBZ fan otherwise better than this movie are the upcoming movie 12 and 13 I recommend buying them rather than this."
3,medium well info,"I am enjoying the cookbook very well. There are a few hints that are somewhat new to me. The recipe that I purchased the book for, did not work well for me, not the recipe's fault, it just was not a success at my house. Very good cooking instructions."
2,Ariat Women's Heritage Western R Toe Boots,"Love the way this boot looks, but the calf part of the boot is super wide and the fit wasn't good at all. Too much room in the calf area. Don't recommend ordering cowboy boots online. You need to go to a store and try them on.I sent them back."
5,These are the boots I have always wanted...,These boots are made by Ariat. I have had shoes by this maker and ordered because of the quality of my other shoes. I was very pleased to discover that these boots are even better than my previous shoes. The boots came more quickly than promised and very well packed. I have worn western boots my whole life and these are the best.
3,Uncomfortable inner seam,"I had to return these boots because of the unfinished inner seam on the shaft. It rubbed my ankles adn felt uncomfortable. Thicker socks helped, but then felt it too tight in the foot. Overall, the boots looked great and were otherwise well-made. Would probably work well if you can wear with thick socks."
5,We love this collar!,We have a lab/pit mix so he is a big strong boy.. We have had choker collars which I don't like so much because I don't want to chain choke him.. And we have had regular buckle collars and he eventually breaks the plastic buckle. And it doesn't put the right pressure on his neck because he is so strong. This collar seems great so far because we still get the tightning action with out the chain choke..
4,well built,"This was not an ideal collar for my pooch. It triggered fight or flight response from him. However, the collar is well built and stylish and I used it until he out grew it for his various tags. we moved to a cheast harness for training."
1,Disappointing,"The smallest collar was too big for my 14 pound pomeranian. She chewed through the nylon collar the first day we had it. After hearing what a great product this was and searching for this collar, then waiting 2 weeks to receive it, what a disappointment!"
2,Poor quality.,"While this type of collar deserves 5 stars, this particular collar seems poorly constructed. I had a previous martingale from a pet store that my lab pup grew out of, so I replaced it with this one. The collar material seemed cheap, the chain leaves residue on my yellow's neck, a grayish stain that is hard to remove. I'm suspecting this is classic Chinese Craftsmanship. Throwing mine away once I find a nice replacement."
4,Interesting book - Mankind's is a little better,"I've just recently become a wrestling fan so I couldn't wait to read both Mick Foley and The Rock's book. I just finished ""The Rock Says"" and thought it was really good. If you are a fan of The Rock, then this is definitely a good read, you will learn a lot about Dwayne Johnson, the person and just how The Rock came to be. It's very interesting but I thought the book was a bit premature in being written. After all, he hasn't been in the business all that long. I found Mick Foley's book much more humorous and fun to read but The Rock Says was a quicker read."
4,Good Book,"The Rock is a really good book. The first half of the book is the most interesting. It is the story of the real Dwayne Johnson. The only part of the book that disappointed me was that he went into character in the book. If he would have just stayed Dwayne Johnson and told us how he had felt during those matches he describes, it would have definitly gotten 5 stars."
4,Know Your Role,"I was very excited to read Rocky's book, after Reading Mick's (Foley). It was a surprising insite to his family and career, but I guess I was expecting another literary piece of genius like Mick's book. I did however enjoy when The Rock took over in the middle of the book; his personality really shined through. I remember Dwayne Johnson from his playing days in the Orange Bowl in Miami...and I have followed his career in Mid South and the WWF and he is one very ""Electrifying"" entertainer."
1,BIG DISSAPPOINTMENT,"EVEN though I am a one of the millions and millions of the Rock's fanz, i truly did not like this book. It clearly shows that this book is not Rock's own words nor was it interesting. Unlike this book, Mankind's was a classic. I think that the Rock should have waited at least till he became a legend to ""write"" this book."
5,The Great One's Tome,"This is the most electrifying book that I have ever read, except for Mankind's book. The Rock exhibits much poise and talent for his young age. His parents raised him well; he obviously loves his family-he dedicated the book to his mom. Do you like pancakes?"
4,Page turner,"This book was hard to put down. It started off slow but picked up when he started to talk about himself. Great description of life thru college and afterwards in the WWF, also growing up in the wrestling family lifestyle."
2,Buy Mick Foley's Book Instead!,"I have read both this book and Mick Foley's book, and Foley's is much more interesting. This book is boring, and doesn't have the heart that Mick's book had. My advice to you: skip this book, and buy ""Have a nice day""."
5,This is a Great book,This book is one of the best books I have ever read! The Rock is truly the most electrifying man in sports entertainment!
1,bad,im a big fan of the great one but after reading the rock says it turns out to be not the great but the bad one . i'd hope that the rock says would be some what like mankinds have a nice day but it wasn't i think the rock should stick with wrestling and leave the books to people who could write
1,Know your role and shut this book,"Good god, where do I begin? This book is awful. Between reading about his boring college days, his being handed a wrestling contract because of his family, and his attempts at being funny I actually feel stupid for hanging with this travesty until the end. To make matters worse, he starts writing in character and to call it annoying would be like calling world war II a minor scuffle. If you value your time, money, and sanity, just move along."
2,The Rock Didn't Say...,"Unfortunately, the biggest problem with this book is that for some reason, the ghostwriter of this book decided to write this as The Rock, with his referring to himself in the third person. It makes the book incredibly difficult to read, and quite annoying, especially when it switches from third to first person references.The history portion of the book is great, with talk about what it was like growing up with Rocky Johnson and Peter Maivia as father and grandfather and having to defend pro wrestling growing up.Unfortunately, this book suffers from over-editing and political correctness, where he is very pro-WWF in every situation, which makes this book seem very contrived, with the WWF hype machine and PR machine guiding his opinions, and making it appear as if The Rock has no opinions of his own.Get it for historical purposes, but for entertainment, stick to Foley."
4,The Rock Says,"This is a great book. Everything was awesome. This book told about the Rock's childhood, his football career, and him in the WWF. I would totally recommend to buy this book. This book also tells about his first matches and how he learned. It tells about the famous manuever ""Rock Bottom"" and ""People's Elbow"" The only thing that I didn't like is that he wrote a lot on one thing and then skipped to much. In two chapters you cover 2-6 years. But otherwise, a great book. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,The Rock Says...,"This is a very good book. In it, Duane Johnson talks about growing up in the sport of professional wrestling. He also talks about what it's like to be the ""most elctrifying man in sports-entertainment today."" I like it when he talks normally in one chapter, then in another he goes into character. Another thing I like are the in-depth matches that he talks about like WrestleMania 15 and the Royal Rumble. The Rock is the only man who can boast being a third generation superstar in the World Wrestling Federation. His father was Rocky Johnson and his grandfather was High Chief Peter Maivia. The best part about the book is when he talks about his football playing days at the University of Miami. How he bonded with his coaches and won a national title. If you buy this book, you won't be disappointed!"
5,IF YOU SMELL WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKING....,This book is a 10 if amazon had a rating system Finally wrestling fans get to know about the other side of how our grappling heroes live their life. ROCK is a great example to me that he can achieve so much and be the #1 man in the business in what is still a white male dominated industry.If you smell what the Rock is cooking.....
5,Too bad you can't put 100 stars instead of 5 for this book!,"WOW! Mick is pure genius! This is easily the best book that I have ever read, and I think that I only put it down about 6 or 7 times while reading it. I couldn't stop reading his stories (most of which were hilarious), and I never got bored. This is a great book that EVERYONE sould read, wrestling fan or not."
4,Now here is an ex-CFL Lineman / former Pro Wrestler I can look up to...,"Bill Goldberg, you musclehead, this is howit's done! Former CFL Lineman and WrestlerDwayne Johnson, black, Hawai'ian-Samoan, isone of the up-and-coming action screen heroesthat has made it. I can't wait to see hismovie about King Kamehameha, when it gets done.Johnson, unlike Goldberg, is grateful for eve-rything he's achieved and not being selfishlike Bill, who it's all about him, is givingback. Also, unlike Goldberg, his movie rolesare getting better! Way to go Dwayne!"
1,Good but too many pictures,It was a good book but for one too many pictures for two Mankind's book was much much better and for 3 Rock didn't write it.
2,The Rock Says,You think if he was going to have someone pen the book for him that he would actually find a ghost with some talent.
3,Not as good as Foley,"This was an easy decent read but no where as good as Mick Foley's book. The Rock simply does not have as much to say. I grew up watching his grandfather and dad wrestle in the bay area, so I was interested in reading about them. In parts of the book he writes as if his character. If found that very annoying."
1,The worst piece of Trailer Park Trash I ever read,"It's a shame when you read this book to actually find out that The Rock was handed a career to him where as wrestlers such as Mick Foley had to earn his career. This book was written well, because it was not written by the rock. I was surprised when I started reading it that it had more than just the 5 or 6 catch phrases that the rock uses day in and day out....If you want to waste your money and some brain cells, be my guest and go get it, but otherwize, spend your money in a better way....This book deserves to be burned"
1,Not worth the money,This book was a huge letdown. My advice is to read something else instead of this book.
1,Terrible,"This book was nothing compared to Mick Foley's. Johnson plays himself out to be Saint Rocky. I like the Rock alot as a wrestler, but he's only been in the business for 3 years. THREE! The purpose of these books is to tell about their wrestling career. Mick was in for 15 years; compare that to the Rock's 3. And it is poorly written and much too short."
3,The Rock,"Now, I havent read the book but I HATE THE ROCK. If you have something wrong with that e-mail me. Undertaker2022@hotmail.com"
1,blech!,People who refer to themselves in the third person should not be allowed to inflict their pompous drivel on the rest of humanity. Yuck.
5,Whatever,"Okay, you people say that The Great One is a phony, SHUT YOUR MOUTH! Yes, Mankind's was good, and so is this. And those of you who say that it's bad because he's in wrestling, DON'T READ THE BOOK OR WATCH WRESTLING! Don't ruin it for us Jabronis! Go back to reading your boring books and leave the millions and the millions of The Rock's fans alone to bask in the glory."
2,How much of this did the Rock actually write?,"I enjoyed Mankind's book, so I bought this one. This one was quite different. It had a ghost-writer, which is an immediate red flag. It's quite evident too, since some of the happenings in the book are out of sequence.The way the Rock talks about losing his virginity at an early age, he makes it sound like it's almost a good thing. Man, don't promote sexual activity to young kids.I haven't read a wrestling autobiography since this disappointment. My advice is this, don't buy this book, don't buy Chyna's book, don't buy Lita's book. Buy Mick Foley's book if you must read about the life of a wrestler."
4,Electrifying,"First- This book is not as good as ""Have A Nice Day"" but it is close. He describes his days as a football player to his days as Flex Kavana all the way to The Peoples Champion. He describes how he got interested in the buisness and how he became a top star. This book is suitable for wrestling and non-wrestling fans. If you liked Mick Foley's book, you will like this book. Also if you like these books watch out for Steve Austin's ""Cause Stone Cold Said So""."
4,Plain honest,"""The Rock says"" is a vivid and honest passage of the Rock's life, from his earliest memories of childhood, to days when he had to rough it out to make ends meet and finally his rise to stardom. The Rock expresses personal accounts of growing up in a family that held much respect; of a Father that turned towards alcohol which threatened family ties; a Mother's strength in keeping a family together; the Rock's admiring love for his wife , her faith in him and his courage and will to succeed. The Rock goes on to explain how the business of wrestling really works, how is life had changed dramatically to face a new, demanding career and the fine line of traditional wrestling and sports entertainment. This book is a must read for fans of sports entertainment wrestling and for anyone who wants to take a peek at the life of a professional wrestler, told simply and honestly."
4,An Inside Look at Pro Wrestling,"I read this book right before the Rock had his big Iron Man Match with Tripple H at Judgement Day. The Rock tells it like it is in his own words, giving readers an accurate insiders look at pro wrestling. A must for pro wrestling fans, but his profuse use of foul language makes this book inappropriate for younger readers."
1,This Book can't hold a candle to Mick Foley,"All the rock talks about is football....football.....football.....I bought the book to get some wrestling insight from the man who is the supposed wrestler to lead us into the new millenium. Dwayne Johnson didn't pay a goddamn due to get where he is today and I hope to never pick this book up again. The only reason he got one star is because I can't give negative stars.Steve's Rating for ""The Rock Says...""negative ten stars"
4,The Rock Says,Many of the superstars of the WWF have written biogrphies on themselves. One of those people were Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock. This book was a great book for a person who really likes the Rock. It gives you background information on the life and liberty of The Rock. It's a really good book for anyone looking to become a WWF superstar because it tells exactly what it takes to become a superstar. I espcially like the tribute to Owen Hart. I also liked the way they went through some of the major events he was in. It told me what went on before the match and how they went through designing the match. It went through the big match at Wrestlemania with him against Stone Cold Steve Austin and just how many times they went through the match together. Int the book it was wierd the way the Rock talked in first and second person back and forth. This would be a great book for anyone who wants to get a more in depth look at the most electrifying man in sports entertainment today The Rock.
5,The Rock Says : The Most Electrifying Man in Sports,I have given The Rock Says five stars because it is very detailed and it also answers a lot of questions I had about wrestling and about the Rock. Also he told great stories about his life it was very interesting. since the book is so good I would argue that this book is one of the best autobiography.
3,the people's champ,"This book offers an indepth look at the early days of the wrestling superstar, the Rock. The book is a nice combination of in the ring stories and outside the ring stories. The book flows at a decent level, but I would like to have read more about experiences with other wrestlers, and how the rock views other wrestlers. Overall, this book is worth reading if you are a true fan of the rock like myself!"
4,Shut your mouth and read this book!,"Admittedly, I'm a fan of the WWF. I'm not goint to say that this book will appeal to everyone, because it probably won't. But Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock, writes a very entertaining, well put-together book. It gives a lot of insight into the world of professional wrestling, peppered with funny anecdotes from his early days. I throughly enjoyed it...."
2,A Crumbling Rock,"After having read Foley's book I was quite disappointed with the book by ""The Rock"". Seems he is walking that proverbial fence between what is the politically correct thing to say and what he really wants to say. Is he afraid he might anger the management and tarnish his image? The book is not as ""hardcore"" as Foley's. He does present the reader with some interesting behind the scenes look at pro-wrestling and I did enjoy the sections about his family, upbringing, and his meteoric rise to the top of his profession.I am however left with a void or empty spot. I think I expected more of the character ""Rock"" to embody this book and what I got was the real person, Dwayne Johnson."
4,The most electrifying book on a sports entertainer!,This is a book that all wrestling fans should get their hands on. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because some of the book is in his Rock character. But writing in his character was also very entertaining! I have not read Mick Foley's book but will now because of the great job The Rock did on this book. Johnson is very different than his Rock character in many aspects.
3,This book was a bit of a Roody Poo,Don't get me wrong I love wrestling and I love the rock but I felt this book has been written way to early i the rocks carrer. The WWF are trying to get more moneyby getting fans to buy all the WWF biographys but the truth is half of the biographies they are going to briong out aren' going to be that good.THE ROCK SAYS.. was a major let down after Mankind: Have a Nice Day. The Rock is really to young and hasn't been in the sport long enough to have a really good impacting book. The section on Owen Hart was an extremely touching tribute which I found extremely hart warming.If you wanna buy it buy it but I suggest you wait a few years for the good edition to come out
5,the rock says read this review......,This is one of the best books that i have read maybe i feel this way because I am one of the biggest rock fans anyone will ever meet. But this book was really written well and it told a very good story describing the rocks(Dwayne Johnson)life story in its entirety. From his days growing up watching his grandpa and his dad compete to where he is now as the most electrafying man in sports entertainment. The one thing that I do believe is that this book could have waited a little bit longer before it was written simply because he has accomplished so much more since then. Other than that it was a great book and i reccomend it to anyone with an interest.
2,THis Book Is Good For Non Wrestling Fans,The Rock Says Is Not So Much Of A Good Book For Wrestling Fans. Not A Lot Of It Is About Wrestling. Mankinds Book Was More Interesting And Exciting Than This Book.
1,Not fit for human viewing,"This book is not fit to be read by anyone. If you feel you must purchase it, please keep it out of the hands of children. It is a shame that someone who is so visible to children has to publish a book full of foul language and degradation. I wish I didn't have to give it any stars at all!"
4,Its O.K!,"Let me get this straight, if you like the Rock, and you like reading stuff like WWF Magazine - type articles. Then you'll love this book, because anything in this book could have been written in WWF Magazine, if not the RAW magazine.But for the wrestling fan that wants to go into more serious issues, then this book is not for you."
3,He is human!,"When watching WWF wrestling, it is hard to believe that The Rock is a real person. He seems more like an idol who's name is chanted by thousands. I wanted to learn more about him. It was interesting reading. He was a kid, like most others, who had a dream of being famous. He went to college, fell in love, graduated, and got married. He even suffered through the hard times that most of us every-day people go through. It was refreshing to get Dwayne Johnson's view on things. He is not the same guy as he protrays. He readily admits that wrestling is ""entertainment"", and that there is a script that they follow. He will also admit that there is real pain involved. It was a very refreshing look at a sport many call ""fake"" and it left me with a new found respect for those who enterain millions of people every week."
3,I'm going to be perfectly blunt.,"This is NOT AS GOOD as Mick Foley's ""Have A Nice Day! A Tale Of Blood And Sweatsocks"". At least his books is penned by him. Here, Mr. Dwayne Johnson dictates what he wants written, and it doesn't seem as if it is his own words.Plus, about 1/2 way through, he breaks into character, and guarnteed, you'll start skim reading, 'cause you'll have heard it all before.Having said that, the first half is an interesting read, but it's more about college football than pro-wrestling. If you want to read a book based purely on the sport of kings and how to pay your dues in the buisness, get Foley's best seller. If you want to find out about the People's Champ, then go ahead. But don't get your hopes up."
1,Good grief,"I've never read Arn Anderson's book, but I did read Mick Foley's. This book here, ""The Rock Says"" comes no where close to Foley's, and I'm pretty sure not as close to Arn's. Maybe if Mr. Johnson had written it himself, instead of letting someone else write his memoirs, it would have been better. In Mick's book, he talks about what it's like to fall off a cage, to wrestle for 200 dollars a week. In Duane's book, after the first couple chapters, he turns into The Rock, and wont break character. And after listening to him spout catch-phrases for over a year now, it gets old, and this book is no exception. A waste of money and time..."
2,No Mick Foley or Ted Dibiase,"If you want to be inspired, read ""Every Man Has A Price"" by Ted Dibiase. For behind the scenes info, ""Have a Nice Day"" by Foley is okay. Dibiase's book is the only one suitable for young readers. Many times, especially when Dewayne kayfabed, I didn't care what the Rock was cooking!"
3,Average,"After goin through Mick Foley's book, you'll probably give the Rock credit for his book. And it seems you should because neither Mick or Rock have a background in writing their own biographies.In short, its an easy read, not much depth, but straight to the point nevertheless. The book goes through the routine of explaining the Rock's life from young in the Rock's own words. But as you progress further, you'll realize that its starts to get rather shallow. You'll get more info on his matches and promos towards the end of his book. The Rock obviously has more wrestling years left in him, and its hard for him to say much during this time..... give him a few more years, and maybe if he writes another book, it will allow him to cover more ground in greater detail.My recommendation is that if you're a true Rock fan or WWF wrestling, its a good pickup but don't expect too much, esp if you've picked up Mick's book first. I'll say, get this first, then Micks."
4,A New Literature,"Those giving this book an unfavorable review fail to understand that it's for the victims of the breakdown of public education. Like the readers of an earlier, literate age, these unfortunates feel an instinctive yearning for communion with the written word. The Rock Says splendidly fulfills that need. Aimed at an audience uninstructed in logic and rhetoric, and unresponsive to nobility or beauty, The Rock Says relies instead on the menancing catch phrases that increasingly compose the lingua franca of a society addicted to TV to convey its message of bestial rage, occasionally tempered by cloying sentimentality. The author brilliantly appeals to the reader's fulsome worship of grotesque comic-book figures, and generally stays within the limits of the modern reader's circumscribed attention span. I would recommend this book to anyone tired of TV or with a broken Nintendo."
2,Gimme something I don't already know,"The Rock says......nothing that I haven't already read in a quadrillion (don't know if that is a real number, but you get the idea)other places. The WWF prides itself on dishing the dirt, but the Rock had few revelations. The guy's not old enough to be very interesting, but I was hoping for some behind the scenes happenings. Some of the chapters ramble instead of rumble, and the writing style is more like a stream of consciousness. The sad thing is, I watch wrestling and the Rock's Dad was one of my favorites. Maybe if the Rock would have written more of his father and the olden days,there would have been something to read about. I prefer Hulk Hogan vs. Roddy Piper, but then, I am just a rambling accountant....."
3,IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT I THINK,"This book was much better than I expected. It was no mick foley, but it was still ok. The parts written in 3rd person were silly and strictly for marks but the actual bio parts were interesting. Who knows how much Johnson actually wrote though? Also it glosses over too much background (especially Memphis). Johnson obviously got a LOT of breaks because of his connections, but he has produced great results when given the ball."
5,Awesome,An intriguing look into the life of the most electrifying man in sports entertainment. The Rock Says surf the web as you normally do and make money! This is a great way to easily earn supplemental income to your regular job.
5,TO THE JABRONIES NATIONWIDE HATING ON THE GREAT ONE!,"First of all I have to say the book is the most interesting piece of literature I ever picked up! If your a true fan of The Rock you will love this book. It is a good book because he tells the truths about himself, unlike other celebrities that wouldn't reveal half the things he did. The punch line is he is a real person who went through real life problems,he started from the bottom to the top, and I think he is a very strong man as well as athlete. Just from reading his book, I found out things about him I didn't know before. You get to really know who Dwayne Johnson is. For everyone who said that the book in terrible, I think they are jealous of his talents and accomplishments. He seems as if he is a very nice down to earth person. All I can say to him is good luck with life and your wife she is a very lucky women! Have some kids soon to keep the name alive, from Peter Maivia, to Rocky Johnson , To Dwanyne Johnson, to Rocky Jr.!"
3,"Almost, but not quite","This book was going great, then The Rock drops into character to describe his matches. I was really enjoying this book up until then. It was well written talking about his childhood in a wrestling family, but once he started throwing his catch phrases into the story it went down hill. The part he wrote about Owen was touching, but he was quick to get back into the character of the Rock. Almost a good book, but not quite."
3,NOT A REVIEW...............BUT PLEASE READ (disregard rating,"Hello, I'm a big wrestling fan and am interested in purchasing The Rock Says and Have A Nice Day. However, I'm having a tough time choosing between the Rock's and Foley's books so I decided to check out the reader reviews. I figured the reviews would help, but from what I see, nearly all are EXTREMELY BIASED(I apologize to the sincere reviewers out there.) Nearly every review is either 5 stars or 1 star from Rock fans and non-fans, respectively. I know of us fans out there just want to help out the Great One, but the people who check this page when contemplating a purchase would really appreciate an unbiased review. Thank you"
2,The Rock says...,"...very little of note.This book is relatively short, and a quick, fly-by read. It's a good thing, too, as if it had been written at any greater length I may well have not bothered to finish it.Let me just explain: I'm not intending to put down Rocky, but this book is the most awfully written of the WWEs 'series'. It feels horribly superficial, and at the end of it I was left with the very unpleasant realisation that it had actually made me dislike him.It has the feel of a school essay that he was forced to write; there is no humor, no real insight, just a run down account of his life. The language is unemotive and bland. You don't much feel like you get to know him, or gain a greater understanding of him. You do, however, get confused and annoyed when he starts writing in character.I only recommend this book to die-hard Rock fans but I warn them that, if they're expecting a book on par with those by Mick Foley, they will be sorely dissappointed."
2,AWFUL!,Let me tell all of you who watn to buy this book: IT STINKS! All it does is tell you his life.
1,No...No...No,"This book is too bad for words, the people before me are either brainless marks or people who don't read many books. This book doesn't come close to mankinds book, for that matter it doesn't come close to Arn Andersons book. The only good parts are all in the first few chapters then it's a hard read. Buy this book if you like the Rock thats it."
1,NOT The Best Rasslin' Book....,"Let's be truthful and honest with ourselves and have a grown-up reality check-The Rock Says is simply not a good book.It is an overrrated,dewy-eyed,ghost-written pamphlet for the racist (all black men are Huggy Bear style pimps) and sexist (bare naked ladies!) WWF,and does not really goes deep as everybody thinks it does.I do not care about The Rock's wedding and I certainly do not care for the politically sinister Nation Of Domination storyline back in 1997. Buy Bret Hart's book,watch the new era Nitro on TNT,and stay lucky."
1,Ripoff!,"Oh, I think this book is great because you know it has never been done before and I am sure The Rock didn't steal this idea from anyone. I'm also sure that it's just a coincidence that this book is published right after Mankinds. And I'm sure all you Rock fans are saying, ""But he has good catch-phrases"". Well Mankind is the Hardcore icon, a great author and a great wrestler who can make himself look good as well as others while The Rock just talks in 3rd person."
1,The only reading pro wrestling fans will do this year!,"This is just what society needs, another inspiration for mentally challenged cavemen who enjoy vicarious beatings and profanity. It's nice to see that some wrestling fans can actually read..."
1,Give me a break....,"Ok this book was not even close to mankinds. All the rock talked about was beating up older kids, sleeping with older women, and how great he thinks he is. Then he goes on about collage football and again how great he thinks he is. And when he finaly started talking about wrestling he did it in charachter...how many times have we heard all those catch phrases. The thing I dont get is how anyone can give this book a good review its horrable. I think they just wanna swing on dwane's johnson. Just because the rock HELPED write this book does not mak it good. I tell ya dont buy this book its not worth it, but if you wanna hear the rock go on and on about himself and toot his own horn for 283 pages. Then By all means waste your money!"
3,A Good Read 4 Those Who Enjoy Wrestling & Behind the Scenes,"This book starts out when the Rock is young and covers his early days in high school and college. This was by far the best part of the book. Then the early part of his WWF career is the subject. Once the book gets to the actual ROCK character the text changes to in-character dialogue with no personal insight into Dwayne's mind. Finally there are some chapters about the Rock's feelings about the business and a heartfelt chapter about Owen Hart. Overall this book isn't nearly as good as Mankind's book, but that would mostly be due to the ghostwriter that was used and the fact that Rock's career is 1/3 of Mick's in length. I must say that this is a must buy for ANY wrestling fan because of all the behind the scenes and insight, but for those trying to get a real grasp on the industry, check out Have A Nice Day! instead. Oh yeah, there are some pretty good pics throughout the book if you are into having that kind of stuff in an autobiography."
2,Shine it up real nice but don't read it,"The Rock is a great deal better in person than in print. Perhaps this should have been a book on tape. Even still, the Rock at only 27 years old doesn't have a great deal to tell. Even though he's a 3rd generation star, and possibly the biggest star in the biz, there are no real tales of suffering in the wrestling business and getting screwed over like Mick Foley's book. It's a nice souvenir to have but the book is basically a white wash with the Rock often in character and little to no inside information or stories."
2,Rock vs Sock,"After reading ""Have a Nice Day"", this book was a serious disappointment. I'm fairly new to the squared circle, so I didn't know just how few years the Rock has been in the business. The interesting stories and anecdotes that kept me going in Mick's book just weren't there. He hasn't yet had the time to acquire any yet. ""The Rock Says"" just wasn't all that interesting. Much like the character. Mankind's book will have an honored place on my bookshelf, ""The Rock Says"" will be going to the used book store."
2,Not Written By The Rock = He's an imposter!,"Now, I am a big fan of The Great One, but when I learned of his book being not written by him I was a bit upset. I have read Mankind's book and I would give that a 6 STAR rating, but the Rock's book -well- really isn't THE ROCK'S BOOK! This book might be written well, but you can tell by the words, the phrases, and just in the writing that it's not the true Rocky words. When you read Mankind's book you almost feel like you know him, but, in ""The Rock Says,"" that is all but gone."
2,His matches are better than his Stories!,"I'm a Rock fan, but that's the only reason I feel even slightly favorable about this book. Don't really see any difference in it and most of the other ghostwritten sports autobiographies I've read--really, Johnson's too young and his experiences are too limited for him (or his ghostwriter) to be writing his memoirs. Also, the switch in character from Dwayne Johnson to The Rock makes things quite difficult for the reader. I wish I'd kept my $!"
2,Only for the fanboys,"I read this book with little expectation because I had already heard less than sterling reviews from friends. It lived up to my low expectations. This book is great if you are just looking for the Rock in character and spouting his catch phrases. If you are looking for anything more than an overlong magazine story, stay away or wait for the paperback. This book feels false and rushed. While the Rock is no doubt a great talent, it's a little early in his career to be publishing a biography at it shows."
2,So the rock says,"Very Disappointing. Especially for those that have read Mr. Foley's fine tome. It is not that Dwayne Johnson doesn't have an interesting story to tell it is that he does not tell it well. Consider the great life he had growing up among all the wrestling legends, as evident with a picture with Andre The Giant, yet he rarely writes of those moments. His book is merely a good start at a rough draft up until his The Rock phase. Then the book is lost. Over a hundred pages ghostwritten in his brash, arrogant, vocal personna. Oh the humanity. Actually his story due to his youth would better fit a Rolling Stone type in depth interview. Don't buy another wrestler's (auto)biography unless they have been in the business for 15plus years or is written by Vince McMahon"
3,Small,"This is a lot smaller than I expected... The picture made it seem like there was going to be more substance. It was okay, but I ended having to get another present for my Dad to go along with this. I wasn't pleased."
4,Good Product,Excellent quality product and very durable. Only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is..what's up with the case they give you for the tweezers? Way too small and the tweezers can barely fit in there.
3,Not Worth the Price,"As I've said elsewhere, I was attracted to the Tweezerman brand because it exuded a high level of craftsmanship... but the reality doesn't live-up to the hype.It's hard to make a tweezer badly, so Tweezerman didn't fail me, here... but the heft of the product doesn't really justify the higher price -- and I wish the width of the slanted tweezers was greater, and that the flat plates that come together to grip whatever it is your tweezing was larger, as well."
1,worst tweezers ever,"These are absolutely, positively the worst tweezers I have ever used. (the point tweezers, to be specific). It is nearly impossible to get the tweezers right at a hair you need to tweeze without a microscope. The tip is that tiny and it is sharp, so sometimes if you grab a hair, it will cut it when you pull out instead of pull the hair out. I'm definitely returning these."
2,Not for professionals,"These are not good quality for heavy use but work in a pinch, I only bought them for the pinch so I am somewhat satisfied but they do not close tight enough for full use on smaller clamps. Anyone looking for a full use tool I would not recommend these pliers. For the price they do what you pay but don't get your hopes up because they won't stay up. Hope this helps"
4,Teaching for Meaning in High Poverty Classrooms,"This book was able to put into words, with the backing of research, my philosophy of teaching inner city children. I found the book exceptional insightful about giving children the meaning for what they are learning and eliminating all of the basic skills ""drill and kill"" that is found in so many classrooms. We, as educators, must remember to motivate and make personal the learning experience for these children. This book is a must read for many teachers and administrators in these schools that are failing our children."
3,"flawed, but worthwhile analysis","The book has its weaknesses, notably that it's not especially well-written. And her analysis of the West's role in Zaire, especially the IMF, is very shallow. But it is an eyewitness account of a fascinating and tragic story, and that compensates for a lot.."
3,Not as great as King Leopold's ghost,"Wrong's book was great for giving a glimpse of the last days of Mobuto's Congo.She was a guarded in discussing U.S. involvement in the days that led up to Mobuto's taking power. Her description of events is shaped by the interviews she conducts and obviously there are many interviews that she simply leaves out.It seems she was inspired by Adam Hochschild's KING LEOPOLD'S GHOST. She makes strong connections to his book throughout IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF MR. KURTZ, but she is more like Hochschild in her use of sarcasm than in her arguments and her presentation of the facts."
2,Disorienting,"I am only half way through this book so I can't be sure it won't pick up some momentum, but I have to say that so far it has been disappointing. The author glosses over such vital information so casually that the reader not only misses her point but later on in the book when she refers back previously mentioned events and people, you're left entirely disoriented. I will keep reading it because the topic is interesting to me, but I don't think the book is well written."
2,Michela is Wrong,"The CIA, Belgium and the IMF are indeed responsible for the tragedy which is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, it is totally wrong not to implicate the United Nations in the death of the democratically elected Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, and hence take blame for the disastrous and chaotic events that followed. In not honestly dealing with this tragic episode and the UN's history, Mrs Wrong book shows how seemingly honest writers on the modern history of Congo still have not decided to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."
4,Starts off great but somewhat loses momentum in the middle,"The first half of the book is a great story of how Belgian rule prepared Congo Mobutu's atrocities and how CIA helped him get to power. Around the middle (as it gets into 80s and 90s) the book gets a bit repetitive and loses momentum. About 2/3 into the book I decided it was time to move on to other things. However, the first half was well worth the money, since I got the book used."
3,"Somewhat interesting, but poorly written","A number of the reviewers sum this up quite adequately. The is not at all scholarly and is a jumbled mess of vignettes. I give it 3 because there are so few books written on the subject and because she tried to be balanced in her reporting. This seems to be a very long winded news article with little depth and real insight. Just a mass of reporting on insignificant experiences she encountered rather than a serious recount of the history. Dissappointed and trying to slog through for any nuggets of insight. Even the brief recount of Congo/Belgium in ""The Scramble for Africa"" was a much better treatment of the subject, albeit solely focused on Belium's colonial period."
4,Behringer comes through again...,"Needed a mixer and figured it was worth the risk to try this inexpensive mixer. It is limited in what it can do but it does the job. I'm rapidly becoming a behringer fan. The three points mentioned in another rating (Inputs should be out the back, needs rubber feet, and the led) are spot on. I'd also like to see another set of outputs on it as well. It could also use being a tad bigger, they jammed everything into such a small area the knobs are a little close together. The LED for the power on this thing is so bright it's obnoxious, it almost blinds you. Other than that its a great and affordable little mixer that does everything they advertise..."
2,No support from behringer,"Hi,The mixer is good, is small and convenient, good price.The powercable plug is quite special and delicate, it has little weak pins that in my case bended. Honestly, I didnt push it they are just that bad.No problem you'd say, buy another power adapter...well there are none !! there is not a single power adapter anywhere in the world, I dont know why but it seems that they dont produce them anymore.From Behringer directly the power adapter costs 28 USD! thats more than half the price of the unit so beware!If you already bought, be very careful because this thing is delicate"
4,No Power Button?,"What were they thinking when they left out the power button on this unit. This unit is great but for this one glaring detail. I use this thing a lot but it runs a bit hot and I would prefer to turn it off and on with a switch. I am afraid I am wearing out the power connector in the back of the unit which is like an S-Video connector. Sometimes it is hard to line up the pins and I think they might eventually get damaged by my constant inserting and then pulling it out.Other than that, this unit really does deliver a lot for the money. I use mine for podcasting on a weekly basis."
3,"Good Sounding, But...","This unit sounds great and does exactly what I need to do for my Total Babble podcast. It gets 3 out of 5 stars because of one weird issue…The bottom of the unit, with plastic feet, is not even. So when you sit the console down on a flat service it wobbles. Because I have a mic right near the console, that doesn’t worked. This was true in the case of all 3 units I tried through both Amazon and Guitar Center locally.I fixed it by buying some of those stick-ons they use for furniture at the hardware store to balance one corner.If you can live with that, you should be happy with this inexpensive, but good sounding mixer."
4,It works and is a great value.,"I use it to connect my Sirus/XM receiver, a microphone and my iPod Classic to a set of Genius speakers. It sounds good. The equalizer feature is a plus as compared to other mixers in its class. It priced right."
5,Behringer 502 Mixer,"This is an awesome unit. I HIGHLY recommend it! Quality is supreme! I'd say the quality is on par with Mackie! The 1/4 inch jacks are rock solid, the metal frame is extremly sturdy and it is dead silent. This is one of the best purchases I've made for my home studio. I'm sure it has the quality to handle gigs as well with no problem. It's 'beefy' and solid in every way. I cannot believe this was only $45. I don't know how they do it for that price. I run my guitar in stereo, my keyboard in stereo and the stereo tape input lets me run my PC into it as well, and I STILL have the mic input if I need it! Just great! Highly recommended! Well done Behringer!!!"
4,Highly Functional,"It's small, it's compact and it works! And what a bargain price..I actually when back and bought the 802 for the band rehearsals and use the 502 for the recording studio. For amateurs this is a good starting point of getting familiar with using mixers. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the instruction are poorly written; it's like two pages..I just had to experiment. Yet, it's a bargain and I'm pleased."
4,Phantom Power,"Most of the 502 units being shipped out now include a Phantom Power Supply. Which for the record a Phantom power supply costs nearly as much as this unit it self. The main thing to remember is that the power is not on the 3/4 but only on the XLR. This unit was simple to use I just wish they would have marked that the XLR was the powered port I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was going on. The sound is amazing I am outputing to my computer for some sound tests and it is flawless great bargain I only gave it 4 stars because of the lack of notifications of which port was powered.Enjoy,"
3,No Phantom Power,"This mixer did NOT come with ""the new addition of +48 V phantom power"" as stated in the Product Description section so I had to return it."
3,No phantom Power,I had to upgrade to the one with it because I needed it for my mic. Otherwise great unit. Solid Construction! POWER LED VERY BRIGHT on all the units!!!!
2,noisy to the point that it is useless,"I used the XLR input mainly, I just can't work with a device that produces so much noise. I wish I knew that before I bought it, but now you know."
2,Low Quality,"I bought this mixer a year ago -- I used it as a headphone mixer for my computer workstation.Even though it lived in a low-stress environment, it stopped working after 6 months.I bought a Mackie for $100 as a replacement. The Mackie is a much better mixer, the knobs move smoothly and it sounds better."
1,Wrong power supply. Blew it up.,"The item I recieved from Amazon was shipped from America to Australia, the power adapted that came with it was the wrong one for australian voltage. I recieved the BEHRINGER PSU MX3UL instead of the BEHRINGER PSU MX3EU...This caused the item's power adapted to short cirut, and I'm not sure if there is any problem with the mixer it self, but this should not have happened. It would be greatly appriciated if you could ship the BEHRINGER PSU MX3UL power supply. This was confirmed by a certified electrician.Thanks. Jessie Thiele"
1,breaks a lot,Bought one and the Phones output broke in three months. Replaced it and the same output broke in two months.I've had enough.John
1,Sounds as good as another mixer... yeah right!,A mixer is a mixer right? I got this and used it for a few years with my little recording desk... I just used it to feed signal from my computer or mbox or ipod or sometimes my pod to my Alesis M1 monitors. I got a bigger desk and was still using the Behringer. One day I needed more inputs and brought out my mackie 1202. WOW the sound improved SO much!!! I was amazed at how muddy the Behringer was making EVERYTHING I ran through it. I'm not saying mackies are the best - I'm sure there's many other mixes that sound better or as good but I would NOT recommend the behringer to ANYONE.
4,im so excited!,"ive just ordered this here on amazon last tuesday. i guess ill have it on the mail by friday or monday then. im just so excited. this is my first mixer. ill be using this for my karaoke software on my laptop and hook it up with my home theater 7.1. now, the whole family and friends will be singing all weekend long while waiting for alabama football. Sweet home alabama, Roll tide roll!!!!"
2,"Not the best, but does the job",i use this mixer for tracks with my band. the only thing i dont really like is that the click always bleeds through the sound system no matter what i pan or tweek on the mixer. does anyone know how to fix this problem?
3,"Misleading specs, but still good value","The 502 unit supposedly has phantom power for mics, according to this amazon page and a few other, but mine came without this option. I have yet to see an image of one that includes this feature, so buyer beware. I'm also a little confused by the headphones routing. I have yet to figure out how to hear the inputs 1-5 through the headphones without turning the ""main mix"" up. When you have monitors connected to the ""main mix"" this is an issue! I'll keep messing with it.Power LED is ridiculously bright. I'm going to have to tape over it. Simply terrible.Quality seems very good so far, excellent audio and good sturdy feel."
4,must have for youtube gaming video's,this was just what I needed easy to hook up easy to use one negitive no on and off switch works great !
4,works great simple to use,I used this one time so far w/my fishman stick and it served the purpose just fine. am looking forward to using it in the future
3,Noise in mic input,"I get some noise from the mic input as well (also, I have the no phantom power*), which is really annoying for trying to record, so I've repurposed it to mix the music coming from my computer,TV,and record player (and microphone, I guess) out to my speakers+headphones/line in/other speakers. It's surprisingly good on its new mission, otherwise it would be a 2 or 1 star for the noise.Stuff I knew about which is only slightly annoying:I taped some paper over the blue LED and put a bottle cap on top of it, but it's still glowing through the tape and cap. I can't believe no one in QA caught this.No power switch is also a pretty bad design decision.Only the mic/line in/#1 input has EQ, and there are very few mixing options for tape in/out (so if you need to mix those, examine the schematics/manual to see if this will work for you).* my microphone is a dynamic microphone, the SM57, which does not require phantom power."
3,Great entry level product,"I had read lots of reviews about Behringer, some people had buzz and noises, etc but this is not my case. I'm not a professional and I just wanted a good mixer to connect my guitar/pedal, my tascam DR-03, my mobile as sometimes I use the Tascam to record, the mobile to reproduce and my guitar to follow.This mixer works great, NO noise, NO buzz, NO nothing but working as expected. Great product for entry level and great price for what you get."
3,Pente is a great game this is a good version.,"Well I love the pente game and this new version does a fine job. It is everything pente should be. It is a great game for stimulating the mind it is more complicated than connect four, but not as complex as chess.The game is awesome!Pros:The game itself is awesome, and I think it is still better than the board version.Cons:I have a couple of grips regarding this version. The travel tube end cap doesn't stay on and all the marbles fell out. I had to tape the end of the tube on to keep it from falling out.The second thing is the game board is like a big mouse pad with a thick rubber undercoating. Which is ok, it is just a little thick and feels like a cheap mouse pad.Conclusion:It is still worth the money."
5,A great family game,"My daughter and grandchildren liked it so much, that I just purchased antoher for their home. Not as difficult as chess, more challenging than checkers. Fast paced so that you dont get bored"
1,Warning: Major mastering blunder,"Great music, but the entire second cd has been mastered at the wrong (slower) speed, making the Au Pairs sound like Flipper. The original RPM CD reissue didn't have this problem. For instance:Instant Touch (this cd): 3:00Instant Touch (RPM): 2:43Shakedown (this cd): 4:22Shakedown (RPM): 4:04Caveat emptor."
5,love this band,"A nice collection that brings together all my vinyl - albums and 7 inch singles. What a great time for music back them and one of the best was the Au Pairs. Love the scratchy guitars, thumping bass lines and fantastic drumming. Let's not forget the excellent vocal interplay between Lesley and Paul, and great lyrics to boot. No slouchy band were The Au Pairs. I still remember seeing them at the Pep in NYC, it remains one of the best gigs from my youth."
3,second rate,"Honestly thes guys sound like a baby Gang of Four with female vocals. It seems as though they know how they want to sound but the delivery of the songs are somewhat bland. Except for a few: Obvious, Dear John, and my personal favorite Domestic Departure. All these songs are from the first CD. The songs on the second are even more dull. A person would probably like the Gang of Four or the Fall better."
5,classy watch,I wanted a watch that was dressy but I could wear everyday and this watch is it. I love the 2 tone as it makes it more versatile.
2,Disappointing..,"I wholly agree w/Deadhead's assessment. I've been a fan of LOS since I first saw them play the cramped Ballard Firehouse in Seattle in 94. I've gone to see them whenever they've come to Seattle since 94, and my enthusiasm for this uniquely talented band has slowly waned as they've continued to move away from the high-energy wholly unique jam music which had made them a must see. Each successive album is more bluegrass than the one before - no doubt the influence of Drew E. who is an obvious a fan of the pickin' and grinnin'. It is severely disappointing to see they've abandoned their roots as a jam band in favor of bluegrass obscurity.Nothing against bluegrass, but this is like having to listen to Jimmy Hendrix play country-western.I too believe it is time to wave bye-bye to the glorious LOS jam band of the past..Bluegrass'ers enjoy."
1,Wrong description,"the product description in subtitles : French, English, Spanish. There is no spanish subtitles in this product !!! Please correct this error."
5,growing pains season 2,season two of growing pains is a really funny one. i have always liked this show very much .still a great show.
5,Great S,I really love the growing Pains. It sucks that there are not many shows like this anymore but at least we will always have this in our memories.
3,Fun for all ages,"Great show, good season. I grew up on this show and love rewatching old episodes when ever I want to. I just wish they would release more seasons, and hopefully in the future they will. Show me that smile again!"
5,Absolutely Fabulous!,"I've reviewed various books for learning Macromedia Flash MX 2004. This is the best. Along with this is ""Sams Teach Yourself Macromedia Flash MX 2004"". They are both wonderful and each have their own purpose. I started with Sams Teach Yourself Macromedia Flash MX 2004 in 24 Hours and use ""...At Your Fingertips..."" for an excellent reference guide. I recommend both books."
2,"Huh? Beautifully written, but weird, with a screechingly abrupt ending","I really enjoyed the writing in this book, and the characters. However, the story got strange halfway through, and ended abruptly, leaving nothing resolved at all, to my mind. I was left scratching my head.Maybe the book is just too ""smart"" for me, and I didn't ""get it"".Were it not for the fine writing and characterization, I'd have considered my time wasted.This was sort of like a David Lynch film, the way I see it, except the characters were more likable. It had the same bizarre, disconnected quality to it. (I hate David Lynch films, in case you didn't guess that already.)Finely honed characters and prose that are sadly wasted on a stunted, bizarre, truncated storyline."
2,"Too, too . . .","It's much too ""post-metafictional"" for me, this Elizabeth Costello character who knows everything about our main character. I waited for her appearance with bated breath, having read other reviewers here and hoping her arrival would give the narrative a much needed jolt of electricity. But no.I miss the South African nuances of the old Coetzee.The new Coetzee writes about -- a man who is losing his physical and emotional capacities and imagines he is in love with his caregiver? Hello? Have we not heard this plot 10 million times before? Or did it just start with Anna Nicole Smith? Endlessly ruminating about one's sad fate is also not a new thing."
4,an unusual story that eventually hits the mark,"'Slow Man' is a decided unusual story about a lonely middle-aged man who loses a leg in a bicycling mishap and subsequently reflects deeply on his life as he interacts with his Croatian caregiver, her family, and a strange character (Elizabeth Costello) who shows up out of nowhere. The story is decidedly morose and slow moving. And why the author brings in this Elizabeth Costello character, who seems to have surreal knowledge of our main characters before actually meeting them. Clearly the author has special place in his heart for Elizabeth Costello since he had previously written a book all about her, which I found to be horribly dull. Thankfully the strength of the characterizations and the satisfying conclusion saves 'Slow Man' from a similar fate. But note to author: please dump this Elizabeth Costello fetish, okay?Bottom line: certainly not for everyone but it works overall. Mild recommendation."
2,Slow Man - Annoying Novel,"I tend to agree with many of the individuals who rated this book with two stars. Like most, I found the first 20-30 pages of this book enthralling. However, as the Elizabeth Costello character was introduced, I lost interest and just wanted to finish the novel so I could move on to something else. Had this book been longer than 262 pages, I would have given up 1/2 way and moved on. I think what I found most irritating was when the Elizabeth Costello character would go off on these rants that would last for pages, which were generally covering the same topics as previous rants. I haven't read any other works by Coetzee and even though this book was painful I could definitely recognize the talent of the author. I trust the author, but this particular story just wasn't a win for me."
2,Utterly Pointless,"First, let me say that I regard J.M. Coetzee as one of the best craftsmen of literary fiction alive today. One would never know it, however, if this novel were the only work of Coetzee's that one had ever read. Though the prose is well-written in the usual Coetzee style, there is no real story here, only a somewhat bizarre, meandering (and dull, to be frank) interaction of characters whose purposes and motives are never fully revealed or explained. I was ultimately left with a bewildering sense of not knowing exactly what it was that I had just read after all was said and done. If judged on story alone, I would only give it 1 star but Coetzee's style begrudgingly earns it another.For Coetzee fans I'd recommend that you skip this one. For those unfortunate enough to have had this novel be your sole Coetzee experience, I suggest that you read the Booker Prize-winning Disgrace and allow Coetzee to redeem himself."
2,Coetzee and the annoying Elizabeth Costello,"Coetzee is a really wonderful writer and every line reveals as much. He puts his protagonist in a situation that is bound to bring him trouble. Unfortunately, he does meet trouble as does the novel when Elizabeth Costello arrives. What was a bit depressing and contemplative turns at first intriguing then annoying. Costello has the ability to know things that she shouldn't, but very little is given to examining the cause of this, let alone the necessity. She fiddles around, pushing a course of action that neither the protagonist nor I want the whole thing to go. Again, it seems that a novelist has run into trouble and has thrown in some other complication to hopefully enliven the book. I'd have been happier if Coatzee had confined her to her own novel."
3,motivational novel,"The novel begins when an Australian photographer who is riding his bicycle gets hit by a car and ends up loosing one leg. It begins very well, but as the books name says it, it then begins a slow , difficult to read novel.I think one should look at it as an inner reflection of what happens when an way of life is changed. Our identity changes, and this is what happens to the main character in this novel.The reader should think of this novel as more than just a novel but as a meditation on what we have and what we can loose and how to cope with it"
2,Pointless,"Not sure of the point of this novel. Paul loses a leg in an accident and must hire a nurse. OK SO far, so good.He falls in love with this nurse and tries to help her family. Then Elizabeth Costello turns up (Why?) Out of the blue. No explaination as to why she is there, her purpose or even why she is in the book at all. How does she know things about Paul Maryna? Did I just not get this book??? Forget it and get a different one."
2,"Slow Man, Slow Read","I think Coetzee has gone down hill since he migrated to Australia. I loved ""Waiting for the Barbarians"" and ""Disgrace"". But this, and the one before that introduced the character Elizabeth Costello were disappointing to say the least.Who IS this Costello woman. She is neither likeable or unlikeable. She is a bore.Don't get me wrong, I am an Australian and there are some wonderful Australian writers, but JMC will never be one.The storyline is simple. Sixty year old migrant loses leg in bicycle accident and gets depressed. Falls for his Croatian nurse. Is rejected.Into this scenario comes Elizabeth C who is supposedly a writer who has 'imagined' the hero (the amputee) and wants him to change in order to make her new novel interesting.She fails. He doesn't become interesting. Neither does the book!"
1,Dreadful reading!,"I continued to read this book because I read good reviews about it. But once I finished reading the book, I was upset that I wasted my TIME on this book."
2,Glad that it's over with,"I am a fan of Coetzee and have read many of his previous works and loved them. Disgrace is one of my all-time favourites but this one left me feeling cheated. The book began with promise and I loved his characterizations of Paul and Marijana but with the introduction of the mysteriour Elizabeth, the book began to spiral downward and didn't bounce back. I had to struggle to finish it and felt let down. I wouldn't recommend this for my book group, which is why I wanted to read it. We loved discussing his other works.Maybe I wasn't in the mood to delve into the inner psyches of the characters but this one left me cold."
5,Wonderful,A wonderful book unlike Coetzee's other novels. Even after two Bookers awards and the Nobel prize he is still taking his craft to new levels.
4,seen better form Coetzee,Magnificient as usual in Coetzee but I prefer Disgrace or waiting for the Barbarians
1,its not what i wanted,this is not what i wanted. the pot is not nonstick so my rice stuck to the pot and was hard to clean. the thermostat doesnt work well so the rice didnt cook well. it is absolutely not good.
1,Horrible Book,"My family and I listened to this book on tape on a family vacation because it sounded pretty neat. Boy, were we wrong! This book is one of the worst things I have EVER listened to in my life. Zindel was extremely gorey when this fish attacked people and many things happended in this book that never would happen in real life ( coming back to life by being shocked by in electric eel? ) Some parts of this book just went on and on about nothing in particular, and I would say only the very beginning of this book gets the one star that I rate this book. Sorry if you like this book, but I really do not recommend it at all."
4,Reef of Death,"The Book starts out in Austrilaia in present time .I thought this book was not the best I ever read but one of the best books. I would recommend this book because it has alot of action and mystery. Right in the very beginning of the book there is an attack on a scuba diver and they keep happening through the book. The characters of the book are PC (Peter Collins McPhee) Cliff , Helen (the grandmother), and Maruul. PC , Maruul, and Cliff wanted to stop the fish creature from killing more people so they set out but will they be able to stop this thing before it kills them too?, find out more of the details by reading this book."
4,Another good book by Zindel,This book was exceptional and very difficult to put down. There is constant surprises and you never know what is going to happen next. Defiantly worth reading.
5,GREAT BOOK,"I loved this book so much, It did take me a while to get into it. Finaly i started all over and tried again. I read the whole thing a in 1 day and it was great! I loved it so much! Wally was cool!"
5,Reef of Death another thriller!!,"Paul Zindel has written another suspenceful book. I liked how the story had some great twists, but a happy ending"
4,review for reef of death,"I recommend this book to anyone who likes horror and action. An example of horror is when the sea creature has killed Arnhen and is now ripping him to shreds. ""It snapped at them as the girl saw Arnhem's torso float up to the surface, saw the white flash of spine and the circle of shredded, raw flesh."" An example of action would be when Dr.Ecenbarger put a guard in the torture chair. A crab was put in a cage and then the cage was put on the guard's head. ""The guard was dead only moments before the crab began the feast on his brain."" In conclusion, I think anyone who likes horror stories and action, should read this book."
5,THIS BOOK ROCKS!!![.],"I am a HUGE Paul Zindel fan, and when I picked up this book and started reading, I almost fell asleep! I mean, a kid gets invited to look for treasure with his uncle. Sound familiar? I mean,how old is that? But after the first 20 pages or so, this book gets good.Really good. People geting eaten, torture chambers with people inside (That was REALLY gory)and an evil, man-eating fish. I mean, what more can we ask from life? HOW MUCH BETTER CAN A STORY GET?!?!?!?![.]"
5,AWESOME!! Kicks,"I have recently gotten into Cryptozoology (study of still unknown animals.) When I read this book, I was thinking ""Finally, a good book about undiscovered animals."" Zindel was very creative coming up with these animals. I thought the torture tank scenes were especially gorey. Well done, Zindel. Your the next Michael Crichton. I am very into stories with animals, action, and of course, gore. Kids need a book like this. Adventure. It's a nice big juicy way of flipping off all those media people that say kids should be sheilded from action and adventure stories because of every little piece of content. Any ways, this book rules. Read it."
4,Northern POW Camps for Southern Civil War Soldiers & political prisoners,"Hard to read because it is too true. A very informative and nothing held back look at the way that Southern POW's of the Civil War Era were treated. In a time of plenty in the North, retaliation caused these men, women and children to be starved and frozen to death as a matter of policy. I had no idea our America was ever capable of such acts of barbarism. But there it is, in black and white. Even though the South had no food and less medicine, their POW death rate was LESS than the Prison Camps of the North. It was a pitiful example of what happens when your brother becomes your enemy to the point that he is no longer human to anyone. Including the US Government."
5,BEST BEST DANCE ALBUM EVER!!,I heard the first song and said that it cant get better than this!! this double CD album is by far one of the best dance albums i have ever heard! every and i mean every song is better than the other i dont know which one i have to switch to when i listen to it..i play the whole thing nonstop!love it..GREAT!!!
2,plastic differential,"I have seen that several responders state that the plastic gearbox housing on Agri-Fab spreaders can not be opened for maintenance. Observe closely that there are three end caps, one for each axle entering the box, that keep the housing closed. This is easily popped open by sliding off the end caps. It can be done with fingers and some force. The bad news is that there isn't anything to be done in there except grease. The housing supposedly keeps the gears in contact, but with some wear to the housing holes, axle shafts, etc. the whole thing gets loose. The gears per se show no wear. It truly is a piece of sh??. I would point out that John Deere spreaders come with a lifetime gear box guarantee. Yet, I just ordered another Agri-Fab."
1,Gearbox is garbage,"The whole machine is well enough built except for the most important part... the gearbox. Mine is plastic. I'm not sure if they have changed the design at all (it looks like it might be different in the picture), but the gearbox in the one i bought a few years ago is all plastic. It very quickly wears out if you put even 60 lbs worth of stuff in the hopper, never mind 125 lbs. Then you are left with a piece of junk that doesn't work very well because the axle is no longer straight. It also is not made to be serviced at all. No screws or anything. Just throw it out and buy a new one when it stops working after a couple seasons. I'm looking for an alternative with a properly designed gearbox."
4,very good so far,"only used once so far. it worked very well. only drawback is the lever for the flow control. it does not close completely, and you must play with it to get the right setting."
2,not suited for even medium use,"this spreader has all plastic gears. this is good for not corroding but the gears are easily stripped if a clump of fertilizer gets to the mixer pin. mine is less than 6 months old and is now usless. the flow rate lever is also very ""iffy"" at best not very accurate due to the fact it has a tendency to move when in use. and where did they get the 125 lb. rating from. most fertilizer comes in 50 lb. bags. my advice ... pay the extra and get a professional model. this one looks cool but just cant handle the work load.one year later:i have now replaced the transmission on this thing twice, also had to replace the wheels due to the CHEAP bearings they used. i put no-flat tires on it which are now worth more that the unit itself. this thing just cannot take the kind of work it is perported to do! AVOID at all cost! mine now has less than 25 hours on it and the gears are strippe out again. i parked it and bought another brand."
1,Very short lifespan,The tow behind broadcast spreader has been used for only a couple of seasons to spread nitrogen sulfate fertilizer twice a year on four acres and otherwise stored indoors. In this short time it is already completely worn out. The zinc plated hardware and drive shaft are corroded. The broadcaster split in half. The plastic broadcaster bearing seized and spins in the plastic holder. The plastic door binds and doesn't shut off the flow entirely. Worst of all the soft aluminum sprocket on the axle that drives the broadcaster is so worn out that it no longer meshes with the drive gear and just seizes. On top of that it is difficult to operate. Don't waste your time and money on this poor quality spreader.
1,Piece of junk,"When it works, it works great. But the gears that turn the broadcaster jam easily. At least the thin tires that go flat when you roll over briars can be fixed; the poorly engineered gears can't. Don't expect more than a few hours of use from this spreader."
1,GO TO THE OUR HAPPY,"Don't buy Arm 04. It suck, I am hate WWE and JBL to cause UT lose. On, RR 05 please WWE make UT win from Heidenreich in a casket match because UT 2-3 on RR.

1,"Seriously, STOP IT WITH THE STUPID REVIEWS!","Ok, I watched Armageddon 2004, and it was a decent PPV, but definently not as good as the other Armageddon's (EG: Armageddon 2000) but I go on here, and all I'm seeing is a kid writing stupid reviews on how good Armageddon 2005 will be! IT's STILL OVER A MONTH AWAY AND SURVIVOR SERIES ISN'T HERE YET!!!!!!!! Seriously, who would want to buy a PPV from this site if a kid keeps on writing annoying and pointless theories to a PPV that isn't even out yet?And even if they are true, a lot of people wouldn't want to know what happens if they haven't even seen it yet!Quit writing those stupid predictions of what you will think will happen at Armageddon 2005, who ever you are, cause no one cares, and you are wasting your time since Armageddon has not been the best PPV from the WWE in the last couple of years."

4,To J.Levyn,"To J.Levyn. The reason why Big Show did the F-5 was because he's a dumbassed immitator who has no brain cuz god forgot to grant him one.I want to take this opportunity to say that Big Show has no carisuma, and is too fat to wrestle. When I found out that Big Show was the 4th pick of the Draft, I was PO. I can't believe he has been a WWE/WHW champion for 3 times!! If he deserves to be 3 times, what about Kurt Angle?! He should be like 6 time. And this week's SmackDown!, if Big Show were to win, I would want Muhammad Hassan to win rather than him.Big Show's DVD is coming out at January 2006. It's one dvd, but it will tell you how much he sucked from the beggining to the end. I bet this dvd's profit will be lower than the dvd ""WWE Viva Las Divas"". Lol.Did I tell you that Big Show has no wrestling skills? He only slaps, does a lift up slam, and does chokeslam."
4,Fatal Four Way,"1. Rey Mysterio and RVD vs Dupree and Suzuki for tag titles- Great Match. Very long match for a tag match. 10/102. Puder vs Mizzanin- This match was a dixie dog fight. Lots of punches in this match. Not bad. 5/103. Holly and Hass vs Basham Brothers- Bad match very boring. 4/104. Cena vs Jesus in a street fight- Cena controlled this match the whole way. Good match. 8/105. jackie vs Marie- funny ending with Hass calling Marie a slut. 7/106. Big Show vs Angle, Jindrak, and Reigns- A real letdown. This match could have been good But they make this match sucky. Worst match of the night. 3/107. JBL vs Undertaker vs Eddie Gurrero vs Bokker T- A great match with Jbl retaining! Undertaker got screwed by Heidenreich which really is good. 10/10"

2,Smackdown puts on another bad show,"Armageddon 2004 isn't worth it to buy; maybe a rental if you're really bored, but only to watch the opener and the WWE Championship match.The opener was Kenzo Suzuki and Rene Dupree vs. Rob Van Dam and Rey Mysterio. These four just seem to work well together, and they put on a pretty good match here.The main event was a fatal-four way for the WWE Championship, as JBL retained the title over Undertaker, Booker T and Eddie Guerrero. Heidenreich interfered against Taker in what has to be one of the most wretched feuds in years. Otherwise, it was a pretty good match. Will JBL ever lose? Does anyone care anymore?The rest of the show is complete garbage. No need to recap it. I'm sure you can fill in the usual suspects."
1,garbage,"how can a product like smackdown still be around? The only good time smackdown had was during 2002-2003 and thats only because of brock lesnar. Lesnar carried smackdown, and now after he is gone smackdown has been putting on crap events like this one. this doesnt even deserve a run down of the matches."
1,"PLEASE, DON'T BUY IT, IT IS SUCK","1. Undertaker vs Eddie vs JBL vs Booker TIt is a very damned match, Heidenreich screwed UT again. I am very sad with this match. JBL still sucked. I hope UT win from him at Wrestlemania to be WWE Champion. 1 star2. RVD& Mysterio vs Suzuki& DupreeNot bad match. RVD& Mysterio won and still retained. 3 stars3.

2,Stop messing up ratings!!!,"This is a rating for Armageddon 2004, NOT 2005.

5,Best capo ever,"I've been playing guitar since the days when elastic capos were the only ones you could find. My search is finally over -- this capo truly offers the best of both worlds. You can custom-adjust it to your neck like a Shubb, but get one-squeeze ease and clamp it to your headstock like a Kyser. Only downside is that people like them so much they tend to walk off with them at jams. Ordering two more!"
4,best capo so far,"I can't speak to the durability of this capo, but so far it does what its claims to; performs like any other capo without completely putting your guitar out of tune. It doesn't always work perfectly, but it certainly works a lot better than any other snap-on type capo that I have tried. At this price its hard to go wrong."
3,Dual Action Capo,Still issues with having to retune the guitar as you 'go up the neck'As good as other capos I have tried
2,Very disappointing,"Sorry guys, but this album was not what I expected. Since when did Strictly the Best turn into Strictly the Best Love Songs? Where's the harder stuff like in StB vol. 35? There are very few up-tempo songs on this compilation and unfortunately it's quite boring and slow. Hey, if love songs are your thing, you'll enjoy it. I've played it 3 times and won't put it in again. If you want a more slammin' compilation, get Reggae Gold 2007."
5,A very pleasant and uplifting show!,"We enjoyed watching this episode very much. It is refreshing to see two parents who love their children and are willing to sacrifice for them. The children are polite, and sweet, and it looks like everyone has a lot of fun. I think most parents could learn a lot from the Bates."
3,Only the singles do well,"Stan Getz' daughter's only album (so far) features her Eurpean hits""Dr.Love"", ""Yeah yeah"", ""Friends"" and ""All in all"". Unfortunately her followup single ""Tadidiboom"" that was meant to introduce a new album never foundsuccess, so there was no second album. The album is very dancey and trancey.There are quite some fillers too . Thefirst track ""She getz away with it"" is quite nice, but apart from thesingles, there are not many interesting songs on this one."
1,"LA Parents, Save Your Money!","I found Whitney's coverage of LA private schools to be incomplete and biased. She left out Windward School in West LA, which has been around for over thirty years! Her preferences for certain schools (Marlborough, Archer, Harvard-Westlake, Center for Early Education, etc.) were clear in her gushing comments about those schools along with the cursory treatment of other schools lower on her favored list. Instead of relying on this expensive, inconsistent notebook of comments to whittle down their list, parents should talk with like-minded parents of older children who have gone through the process, check out websites, and visit open houses to get a truer sense of which school would be appropriate for their children. I returned this book immediately."
1,The information is not current at all.,"I work at one of the schools reviewed in Ms. Whitney's revised and ""updated"" edition, and much of the information regarding our school is over 4 years old. Perhaps she was random in her updates..."
1,Save your money,"This was an outdated, biased review of private schools. Not sure what expertise this author brings other than having a lot of time on her hands, clear bias about the types of schools she values, and a word processor. Of the schools we elected to visit, we found that some schools had actually moved years before, and yet she did not include this information. In addition, she would make foolish comments, such as noting the number of Range Rovers in the parking lot of one school and then lamenting that she herself cannot afford one - we don't care. This is a glorified, and out of date phonebook that leaves out some wonderful schools (e.g. Westchester Neighborhood School) and unfairly chastens those that don't ascribe to her preferences. Skip this - save the money."
1,Disappointing,"I thought this book would save me some research by giving accurate, detailed and evenhanded descriptions of Los Angeles private schools. It doesn't come close. You can tell she didn't think certain schools were worth the effort to get more information by their omission or brief, superficial reviews. I also found the format and print job to be amateurish. Don't rely on this to guide such an important decision."
3,Good but more for the west side of LA,"It is a pretty informative book but it covers more schools on the west side of LA rather then the east side, such as Pasadena. I expected a more will binded book for the priced I paid. It is a bit expensive for something that looks like it was printed at Kinko. I also wish it covered some schools in OC since OC is another area we may move to in the future."
2,I'm sorry it's not for me...,I think you have to be Mexican to appreciate this CD. I totally think the Mora-Ariagas are talented and i loved seeing them in Shakira's unplugged performance but that's the most for me. I grew up on Villancicos from South AMerica so i tried to love this cd but I just couldn't. If you are of Mexican decent or just love Mexican music I think you will love this but it just wasnt for me. The only song i liked is el burrito sabanero. However you can hear and feel they put so much love into this album because Christmas is the biggest celebration in all of Latin America and that cannot be denied from listening to this album.
2,Useless Buckels,"I picked this bag up to try to make my over seas travel easeyer thinking the 4 buckels would be used to hold the day pack in place, thay don't, in fact thay do nothin but get in the way of the main zipper. The fold away handle sticks out a good 2"". the size must be over all not mesured from inside the bag, its to small for my needs. the only thing I have used this bag for is I carry my work tools in the day pack, its small enough to fit insid and other rolling back pack that I check."
2,broken already,"I really wanted to like this bag. It's lightweight, and I really like the day pack, but after 6 months of light/moderate use, one the of the zippers is broken and a hole has appeared along one of the seams."
5,Great Times Great Music,I received this CD for less then $7.00 It is packed with some of the best music of soul and motown . I tried to order this from PCH time life music there price was $19.95 for the same CD it took 8 weeks to get to me. When I ordered it from Amazon it only took 3 days to get to me. Thats service.Quess what one I sent back...........
4,Funny for SCTV fans,"My husband and I, who watched the series when it aired, enjoyed it. Our kids, who are used to a different sort of sketch comedy, didn't appreciate it as much."
5,SCTV Remembered,"In my opinion, SCTV was an incredibly funny series with a group of intelligent, clever, and talented performers. These 2 Christmas shows brought back a lot of memories for me. Having said that, I do agree with reviewer JD in that a great deal of the humor is probably arcane to most younger viewers, and the pointed send ups will likely be lost on many of them.That's always been the problem with topical humor."
3,Does work !!!!,Still playing with it but it does work !!! I did the experiment where I put most of the things in the sealer and one of each out on the counter and the stuff in side the sealer was fresh. I just found out though that you should not put in there real juicy things (ie. plums and peaches) if not eaten right away!!!!
1,Not ready for prime time.,"My food sealer is useless. I have asked to return the item and the distributor is giving me the runaround as they ""wait for a reply from the manufacturer."" That has gone on for weeks. I cannot see that they are standing behind their merchandise.Sheridan"
2,"Good Idea, bad product.","First day, I plug it in and it works great. Later I grab a piece of fruit out and close it-but it never re-seals. No obstructions, no damage to the seal.Maybe I got a faulty unit. Though I don't know why it would work at first then crap out after a day...."
1,do not buy,"I ordered in feb.worked great for 6 months then motor when,cannot return because of amazon return policy was up april. DO NOT WAST YOUR MONEY!!!!"
5,Gift,"We gave this product as a Christmas gift. It arrived on time, with no damage . The product was not used yet."
2,Not for fruit,"Since I could not find a Fruit Saver anywhere, I stumbled upon this product. It had good reviews, so I bought it. Very disappointed with this unit. The fruit spoiled faster than it would have out on the counter. Condensation would form in the unit, causing mold to form. I wasted a weeks worth of fruit, and that does not come cheap.I will try bread in it and see how it works."
2,Not very useful,"I bought this to try and keep our banana's from going bad so quickly; and to stop our fruit fly problem. It didn't slow down the banana's getting ripe at all. And, when I used it for strawberries, they got moldy super fast. The top of the lid was always wet with condensation. The only thing it was good for was to keep the fruit flies away... but a $5 tupperware container from Walmart does the same thing!"
1,Stupid Mistakes,"Although I admit that the book is good book, it's easy to understand and follow, there are many stupid mistakes in it and it could be really confusing. It looks like the book wasn't proofread, some mistakes are so obvious I don't understand how they didn't fix it. I'd say look for something else and don't waste your time with this book."
5,Great Books,The books came right away and are great tools for studying the GED. They cover every subject of the GED and explaining the testing process for each test.
4,God for non-motovated students,I bought this book for a student of mine that was planning to drop out of school. I told him that he could take the GED test and get a GED diploma. He has been using the book and says it is easy to follow and not difficult to understand the information; plus he is staying ion school untill he takes the GED test.
4,"Excellent, with a grain of salt","So you adore the Descendents, and am fairly affectionate for All, you SHOULD like TonyALL. This isn't punk, it's not hardcore, it's the ""surf-pop"" of pre-Milo Descendents. You know ""Ride The Wild"" and ""It's A Hectic World"". All tongue-in-cheek puns and goofy dork-punk-surf-pop.Chuckle over the lyrical twist of ""U R Super"" tolerate the quaint vocal straining of ""Special To Me"" sing along to ""Guitar Case"". Think about how quirky life was when you were 16. That's it, nothing more. Don't expect Beach Boys harmonies, Pennywise punk drive, or Metallica musicianship."
1,3 days to talk to a human in customer support,"Over the past year I have owned this product. It has slowly leaked after one month. I have tried to get a replacement part for this which has been a nightmare.Anytime I call, whether it be at 8 a.m. or just before they close at 9 p.m. I am place on the eternal hold. This is not a one time occurance. It has honestly taken me 3 days to actually get ahold of a human.The product is below what they advertise, and customer service is worse than Mc Donalds."
1,Pressure problems,"The pressure is different when used ""hands free"" vs the handle. Pressure is too low when using handle, but is OK when using hands-free. With low pressure, some water splashes sideways when passing through the spout. The angle of the spout points out too far and splashes the sink and goes all over. We have well water with 60 lbs. of water pressure. Maybe more pressure would help. I have called customer service and they have not been helpful. I would not recommend this faucet."
3,Cute,"This was a cute toy, but for the very young. You can push it around & it does make some cool sounds, but that's about it."
3,Good Details,"The concept and details were perfect for my son, but it was just WAY TOO small. This is more for a 1 yr old. who can walk."
1,Won't stay powered on,"My son cranks it and starts pushing, and then stops about 5 seconds later when it powers off and say's, ""The yard looks great!"" That's all it ever says. It would be nice if it would stay on for more than 5 seconds."
1,Dro not buy for outside,"Will not now on grass. Handle to short for kids over 2-3. Poorly made, was really disappointing. Unhappy little guy with this toy."
3,Pricey but fun,"This toy was a lot cheaper made than I expected for the price, but my 1 year old grandson loves it."
1,poor quality,We received this as a gift and I'm glad we didn't waste our money on it. I think of a lawnmower as an outdoor toy but this one is meant for indoor use. It's too low to the ground to push over anything other than a smooth indoor surface. We left it outside in the rain ONCE and the electric components for the sound effects never worked again.
3,Small,"Im bought this item on line for my 4 year old grandson,He wanted to be like dad...It was ok.. But real small...I realize these things are made for small children .. BUT I cannot see a 18 monthold child wanting to mow the grass...."
2,JD- Elect. Mower Toy,This lawn mower did nothing to impress my children... It was too small... they are 3.... i also got the fisher price bubble mower.. they loved it...
3,Look for another toy mower,"The was the first lawn mower toy I bought for my son (we ended up buying a 2nd mower, the Fisher Price lawn mower, to replace this one) and it was on sale, and now I know why. I bought it at the beginning of the summer when he was 18 months ago. I think they (him and his twin sister) have played with it for a total for 10 minutes. They always choose another lawn mower (we inherited another Fisher Price lawn mower) or toy over this one.Here are the things I was disappointed about:1. the handle does not stay up. If my son, or me, let go of the handle it went right to the ground, doesn't seem like a big issue but not much fun for him if I am trying to hand the handle to him and we aren't in synch and he misses the hand off.2. the body is so tall it is hard to fit in the basket of the stroller to take to the park3. the sounds are so soft it is hard to hear them if there is any noise in the backyard"
1,The Lawn Mower,"I agree with K. Barnard - the handle is a problem. And the wheels are too small to allow the mower to be pushed in the grass. It may be a good inside toy, but my grandson wants to be outside with Papa, following in his footsteps. This toy frustrated him because it would not go in the grass. The $2.00 (on sale) plastic piece of junk mower we bought him at Toys R Us was a much more functional mower for a child of shorter stature (he is four years old and has been helping with the mowing for a couple of years)."
2,Disappointed,"We were disappointed with this product, because it was not as advertised. In fact, if you look at the picture of the item on this review, you will find the items is still misleading ... we purchased the item expecting a pull cord, as the picture shows and the product literature states, (Our grandson has another mower by Little Tykes that he loves to play with, but it does not have a pull cord like his ""pop-pop's"" mower & that is why we were purchasing this one.) but, when received this mower it does not have a pull cord. The pull cord handle is not even standing as the picture shows ... it is simple pasted or molded to the engine cover. Had we known this to be the case we would not have purchase this product ... it is not even as good of quality as the Little Tykes one."
1,Too small for my 4 yr old,"Only giving it a 1 star because the recommended age range is 2 - 5 and it's entirely too small for my very average sized 4 yr old. Returned the product unopened, but it looked well built."
5,great buy,My 3 year old loves this mower. He's used it for 2 weeks now and most mornings will mow the house. He enjoys the sounds and plays with this more than his other mowers. This toy seems to be very durable which is a big plus considering the miles he'll walk with his mower.
4,Tough and Fun,"Our son has gotten hours of fun from this toy, ""mowing"" the carpet and tile floors and pushing it around the garage. True, the wheel size makes it hard to push in the grass, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. How durable is it? We left it out in a thunderstorm over night and the thing never missed a beat. Fired right up the next day. We've had it for six months and I would have to say it gets almost daily use. Our son is 2 1/2.Some prior reviews cited that the handle was a little tall, but our son doesn't seem to have a problem with it for the most part. In typical boy fashion it has been launched down the stairs, pushed off of the couch and the thing doesn't quit. When it rains or gets too hot out, I'll often ask our son if he can do some chores and ""mow"" the living room for me, which he does with delight. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that he'll have the same reaction when I ask him to mow the lawn in about ten years!"
5,A lot of truth in a few words,"One of the best means of communicating truth is through story-telling (see Jesus). Tolstoy clearly understood this and this short story does more than tell a story it plants the seed of truth deeply in the human heart. The plot is not predictable, keeps you interested and leads you somewhere important. Well worth your time."
4,A Fine Collection of Beasts,"In The Heraldic Imagination, the various odd monsters and creatures found in heraldry (ranging from the commonplace dragons, unicorns, and griffins to the obscure melusines, yales and apreses) are laid out and discussed. This book is a must-have for anyone seriously interested in the field of heraldry.The book is not perfect- it does go into significant detail about heraldry in general, which detracts from its focus as a bestiary of armoury. It also contains a number of errors, such as the description of what is actually a badly-drawn wolf's head crest as a new form of sea-dragon. These errors are neatly summed up in a review in The Coat of Arms, and are not enough to ruin the book."
4,Works well and gets the job done,"Overall I am very happy with this cover since I bought it 6 months ago.Pros:Easy installMade wellKeeps box and contents dry during rain or snowQuick to roll up or roll back downCons:Not air tight (didn't expect it to be) dust from dirt roads can be a problemVelcro holds pretty well, but have doubts a year from now how it will doFrame is above truck box, so your not able to lay anything across it"
1,What happened?!,"Jesus, what happened to Greg Ginn? ""Dick"" and the rest of his solo work is horrible. It's so incredibly disappointing! If you are a fan of Black Flag, I warn you not to listen to any of his new music. It will tarnish your ideas that Ginn was the epitome of a punk rock guitarist and a legend. I am at once confused and saddened, left wondering how in the hell does this happen to a guitarist like Ginn. Perhaps this is the work of father time? Is this the fate of the punk greats that we once idolized? Lame, out-dated, poorly produced dribble? And get someone to design you albums Greg! It's like you just discovered computer paint. Man, I'm depressed after listening to this. For the love of God, stop making music! You should've stopped after Black Flag, because it's all been down hill from there and ""[that]"" is the bottom."
3,One of rare real Italo singers.,"I mean the guy was real. Ken Laszlo on the picture was the one really singing, which was not tha obvious for many other ""artists"" of the style (e.g. Joe Yellow or Den Harrow), who were simple phoneys. I think Ken Laszlo had a really distinctive voice so it was easy to pick him out of the rest of the singers. The only problem is the projection. Maybe those of you from, say, the USA can tell me what the hell the guy is singing about!!!!"
2,Not as informative,"This movie only describes trans fats in detail. I thought it would talk about many food additives like HFCS, colorings, preservatives, artificial flavors, etc. It did mention aspartame but left no concrete information about it. It was interesting to me that the movie maker was a nurse who did not even know what ""partially hydrogenated oils"" were.This is an okay movie for true beginners, those who eat fast food and don't ever read their food labels. If you already take the time to read labels and buy healthy organic foods rather than fast food then skip this one.I am a vegan of over 8 years and was hoping to find a good film on food additives, but this is not it :("
4,Book Lover's Trivial Pursuit,"It can't compare to the original Trivial Pursuit, but for a specialty product, this is pretty good. There are some modern authors/books that I had never heard of, but the children's and classics categories were answerable, for the most part. Like other versions of Trivial Pursuit, there were definitely favored authors/books that came up several times, which makes guessing a little easier. My main problem was getting my non-English major friends to play with me..."
3,Over My Head,"OK, so I'm a historical novelist and have consistently read ""literature"" for several decades. I was so excited to get this, I opened it immediately. Of the 4 cards I pulled out at random (24 questions), I answered two. TWO, people! And of the two, I only answered one because I watch ""Bones"" on TV!Now I can't figure out who to snail this to. As the previous comments suggested, this'd be a ton of fun for booksellers or English Lit majors. My librarian fiend specializes in historical fiction also, so she'd probably be almost as bad as me. All of the ""Harry Potter"" children's questions make about as much sense to us as the ""sports"" questions in the regular Trivial Pursuit version. At least in that category, we could answer some ""booze"" questions!It's a good game...For someone more knowledgeable in the varied categories, such as anything written in the past 20 years."
2,This game is SO hard.,"I love most editions of Trivial Pursuit (I own 6 different versions), but this one is pretty hard. I realize that it is a specialized game, but I tried playing it with a couple of my librarian friends, and we couldn't come up with the answers. We played for about half an hour before finally giving up. Between all of us, we have over 30 years of library experience and we couldn't play this game. I'm not sure who the target audience is if not us. Wouldn't recommend this unless you are an avid reader and literature buff."
3,What a challenge,"THis is a challenging game! Stimulates your mind across many subjects. IT is fun to play cross-generations, to see what epople have read and what other generations read."
3,Very Educational,"12/25/05 The 380 cards of this Trivia Pursuit Book Lovers Edition which I received as a Xmas Present ,just on the 1st card shows me how little I know in the categories ..Each Card contains one Q & A from CH(Children),CL(Classics),NF(non Fiction), BC(Book Club FAvorites), AU(Authors),BB(Book Bag Surprize)..My biggest challenge is to not get distracted with ""trivia"" regarding ""bio"" on the authors (e.g. Card 1-on AU-""Who founded the National Association of Window Trimmers before penning the children's bestseller Father Goose,His Book in 1899(I was interested in finding out that he(L. Frank Baum of ""The Wizard of Oz fame) had these books:Father Goose(poetry) vs His Mother Goose(prose),but not interested in his association with ""window trimmers""."
3,WWE Divas-LITE,"This is more along the lines of WWE produced Diva DVDs than the original Vixxen videos that showcased Missy Hyatt and ""friends"". It's not horrible by any means but if you were expecting something more ""revealing"" than this isn't for you. I could've sworn a product description stated matches involving the women on this DVD would be included, but alas- there are none."
1,The New Era dosen't follow the old format!,The other wrestling vixens shows hot women doing strip shows to the buff! This piece of fluff has some girls only in swimsuits and little outfits! Skip it and order the others if you can find them stll in print!
5,I love it!,Learn to be Movie Actress/Recording Artist/Model/Authenticated Authority/Honorably Discharged Military Police Officer Ishah Wright's spy to better give tips independantly to the FBI! It's awesome!
4,Running rings around the words,"I really enjoyed this book. I learnt an enormous amount about my own language but also about many other north European languages. Tolkien was such an imaginative man. I live with a Swedish woman and am familiar with some Swedish words, terms and concepts and I found myself saying 'Aha!' all the way through the book"
5,Simply...A Beautiful Book,"Words fail me, unlike Amanda Eyre Ward. This is a tightly woven, simply beautiful book that resists description. This is the best book I have read...no, inhaled...in years. A work of art that will change and rearrange you if you let it in. Thank you, Amanda Eyre Ward. Please keep writing and feeling and telling the story of the human condition."
3,Not her best book...,"This was a good book - though I did enjoy _How To Be Lost_ a lot more. The characters in this novel were quite strong, and there was definitely a high emotional appeal, but the plot was very predictable. The biggest (and most shocking) drawback to the whole novel was Karen. Her entire crime wave as well as personal life was completely lifted from Aileen Wuornos's life. Ward hardly put any spin on that true story at all (other than change Karen's race) to make her story unique. I wouldn't have been as upset had Ward acknowledge this inspiration anywhere in the book. Since she did not, it seems a bit life theft. The book came out the same year as the film _Monster_, so the good ratings of the book are really shocking, unless the book's release preceded the movie's. It was well-written, and I am glad that I read it, I just wish that Ward had thrown out some sort of acknowledgment that she based Karen of Aileen."
4,Unexpected,"I didn't expect to like a book that centers around a women's prison, but Sleep Toward Heaven is really a beautiful book. The women's lives are heartbreakingly intertwined. It's hard to think of anything that hasn't already been said, so I'll just contribute that you shouldn't be turned off by the prison setting."
4,Best Women in Prison Novel Ever!,"This novel is that notable exception--a literary nail-biter with a heart as big as the barren plains of Texas in which it is set. Ward's story of three women connected only by a murder is smart, ambitious, and just plain riveting. In Gatestown, Texas, twenty-nine year old Karen passes time on Death Row, counting the days til her execution. In New York, a young doctor named Franny receives an unexpected phone call while she tries to figure out how to escape the tragic loss of a patient and the clutching arms of the man soon to be her husband. In Austin, Texas, another young woman named Celia attempts to recover from her husband's untimely death. As promised, this one did, indeed, keep me up all night reading both in order to find out what happens and in awe of Amanda Eyre Ward's talent--masterful."
4,was moving,"I thought this book was very moving, and it made me pause and think. Makes you think about the choices people make, and how wrong they are. I would recomend this book to a kindle friend. juls m."
3,cannot put it down.,"This novel from the beginning is impossible to put down. I don't read much at all unless its an extremely amazing book. So if I were you id go get this book, and start it ASAP. :)"
5,Kindle formatting very poor on this edition,"Heartbreaking and beautifully written, I look forward to reading more by this author.The publisher, however, should be ashamed of the Kindle formatted book they released. At anything but the smallest font size, this book is almost unreadable. The last word on most lines drops to the next line, and is often the only word on that line. Every so often the book title is listed in the body of the text, along with a number that I think is the page number. Sometimes it lists the author's name instead. Wherever there is italicized text there is no space before the first letter of the first italicized word, or the last letter of the last italicized word, so words run together. Where the sections break into the different women's characters, the first letter of the section is isolated above the first paragraph.If you intend to buy the Kindle version, get a sample first, and make sure the formatting issues are not so extreme that you won't finish this excellent novel."
2,Disappointed,"I read this as a selection by our book club. Having glanced at the reviews for this book already on Amazon I had high hopes and still think it's interesting subject matter and should elicit good discussion. However the book itself was far too shallow - you didn't get to know or care about any of the characters. All of them were glossed over in far too little detail. Karen read like the Charlise Theron character in 'Monster' and Franny came across as just weak. How did she ever leave Texas at 16 and get all the way through med. school? It just didn't mesh and gee, was anyone surprised that she and Rick end up looking like a couple? I'm sorry, good subject, serious issues but just not dealt with in any depth at all which is too bad. And what's with the type face? How much white space do you want on a page???"
3,Subtle and sad,"This book chronicles the lives of three women, a doctor, a death-row prisoner dying of AIDS, and a woman whose husband was murdered. The story is told from the perspective of each of the women as their lives slowly converge over the course of one hot Texas summer.Ward's style is subtle; the stories weave together delicately. I was especially fascinated by the prisoner's story - Ward's portrayal of women awaiting execution on death-row is raw and real. You couldn't help but feel sympathy for these women, despite the brutal crimes they committed.The book isn't perfect. I thought all three voices sounded pretty much the same. The character of the doctor wasn't very well developed. But, overall, this was a good book and a very fast read. I give it 3.5 stars and would recommend it."
3,Depressing Yet Thoughtful Debut,"Sleep Toward Heaven is the story of three women who attempt to cope with unfathomable loss--the prisoner, her loss of freedom and health; the victim, the loss of her husband; and the doctor, the loss of her identity and happiness.It is depressing from start to finish, so brace yourself before beginning. Ward has a nice, clipped, yet thoughtful style that doesn't quite manage to create a distinction between the characters of the doctor and the victim. Other satellite players enter and leave this story of loss; but overwhelmingly, there are only the three women taking independent, solitary journeys that converge at the final scene at the Huntsville Prison in south Texas.The women find ways of reaching peace with their inexplicable losses, but the story is morbid and discouraging. I was glad for the story to end so I could start another novel. Ward will likely blossom with experience, and so I recommend keeping a close eye on her future endeavors."
1,"False Advertising! Not the same ""Prince""","This cd came up when I did a routine search for new music from ""Prince"". Amazon.com did not show a picture of the album but did show one of the other recommended albums being ""Rainbow Children"".When I got the order I was shocked to find a completely different artist on the cover! A big disapointment when you are expecting new music from the one true Prince."
4,Historical-Oriented and Not Sided,"Kristin Luker has not taken sides in this book and is very helpful in discerning historical background; this is more based toward anti-abortion, though. (More pages that focus on anti-abortion)"
3,Overhyped but Still Worth It,"The critics got me all worked up on this release. So I jumped at it. I have not yet felt buyer's remorse, but the music ain't as wild as I thought it'd be. Don't get me wrong. I dig Ry Cooder mightily. And this is among the better of his excursions in Cuba. Just be wary of the hype and enjoy it on its own merits."
3,Not my favorite Ry Cooder record,"I have several Ry Cooder records. I like all of them, some more than others, and this is not one of my favorites. As usual for a Ry Cooder record, the musicianship is great but the concept doesn't work too well for me. There is less variety on this record than some of Cooder's other records. The music is very stylized and I find that a whole record of this music is a bit much. This record is mostly instrumental (the limited vocals are in Spanish) and I think that contributes to the sameness of the music. It is pleasant background music, but a little dull."
5,midnight at the club !,I love this album. I got the feeling of being in a club listening to a band late at night who were as buzzed as the audience.Boozy/bluesy vibe over latin percussion. The ultimate lounge album. You can almost see the couples dancing slow to the rhythms.Great music.
4,Sweet Cuban-roots synergy,"A playful instrumental collaboration between roots music avatar Ry Cooder and Cuban guitarist Manuel Galban, of the early 1960s doowop/pop/son ensemble, Los Zafiros. It took me a while to warm to this record, but when I did I was won over... It's a fun, spirited collabration, and Cooder and Galban obviously got a real kick out of working together. It did seem, however, like territory that's already been covered in recent years -- rock-tinged. latin-dance-y, neo-exotica, as heard in the work of bands such as The Friends Of Dean Martinez, Marc Ribot, et al. Still, Ry's a master of world pop, a trailblazer who was touching on this material decades ago, and he still has a masterful touch. Longtime fans and devotees-by-way-of-Buena Vista alike will not be disappointed."
5,Bliss,"I have not experienced such musical bliss for some time, Perez Prado + Dick Dale + Les Paul = Ry Cooder/Manuel GalbranMambo Sinuendo. I love these tracks...a rare treat. You won't be able to stop smiling listening to Patricia, and Secret love is every corny adjective I can think of..mesmerizing, haunting, spellbinding guitar bliss."
3,Odd mix of cuban and lounge,"Overall a good album - inventive, fun, soulful - but there are weird moments of cheesiness tossed in."
2,good i guess...,ry cooder could have had a much more grandiose farewell from his investigations of afro cban music. this soundslike a forced goodbye...he tried too hard. the previous records were delightful. this is not quite up there
2,"Mostly a diappointment, but ONE GIANT surprise","I too am a fan of the Buena Vista Social Club phenomenon, and I too looked forward to hearing what Ry Cooder had found, again. Like a few other reviewers, I found the playing somewhat uninspired. For those familiar with the classic ""Patricia"", was this version anything but ordinary? Did you not anticipate one new riff, one new angle to this tune? Track 7, ""Bodas de oro"" is the best of the cuts. Now for the surprise: At the beginning of track 11, ""Boleros sonambulo"", I hear this incredible piano, so I go to the liner notes, and there is NO piano listed! Ry Cooder is given credit for electric piano on 2 tracks, but NO piano for Track 11. Listen carefully, it is, undoubtedly, yes, it is REUBEN GONZALEZ! Yes, it's him, and unmistakeable! What a find! Please, give us more before he's gone..."
2,Loungy Muzak,"Bummer! I was really looking forward to this CD, based on reviews & interviews with Ry Cooder, but it's really a letdown. Maybe the mambo has just been ruined for me by all of the imitators out there, but I didn't see much spark from this. The day I got it I threw it on during a dinner party thinking it would be really cool & after a while we all just looked at each other and said ""what is this?""... in a bad way. Save your dollars... don't say you weren't warned!Enough with the embargo already!!! Open up Cuba so we can hear more of the real stuff before it's too late..."
4,Another great Cooder album,"Lots of lush reverb and ringing chords, surfed-out tones and tropical vibes, lazy tribal riddims and colorful melodic pastiches.Perfect for zoning out in a hammock on the beach, watching the sun set and the moon rise.Drift away..."
2,Hawaiian slide guitar ???,"As a lover of Cuban music I find this CD difficult to listen to. Hawaiian slide guitars have no place in Latin or Cuban music and I fail to see why Cooder injects his own into an otherwise good CD. These renditions would be far better without the annoying slide sounds. The Buena Vista Social Club was a great CD marred only by the slide guitar. I give Mr. Cooder a tremendous amount of credit for ""discovering"" the Buena Vista but please leave the slide guitar for other genres."
2,listen before you buy,"If you're a Ry Cooder fan, listen before you purchase this album.There's simply no depth, no emotion, no smiles when listening. Its weak, pure and simple.The first time we played it we advanced to the second track after a few minutes. Into a bit of the second track we simply turned it off and thought we would try it another time. Its been on twice since and we still have not made it through the album."
1,Que desilusión!,I was thoroughly dissapointed with this CD. Lounge music of the worst kind. What a pity.
3,Can anyone speak spanish?,"Could someone please correct the title of the first track? DRUME is one word, it means ""go to sleep"". This isn't celtic, guys."
4,NOT BAD,"Man, the Oompa Loompas are pissed. And they're on this album. I like this a lot. Very original and crazy. Definately worth hearing even if you don't plan on buying it."
2,Not the same song with a different title,"This is a very interesting Record, which has to bear with the ambiguous effect of having a sticker on it that reads ""featuring wes borland of LB"". On one hand, it will inevitably be compared to LB's mainstream ""let's give 'em what they wanna hear"" kind of music. LB fans will probably hate it, and ""MTV's top 20"" haters might not give it a chance for Wes' affiliation to LB. On the other hand today's increasingly conservative record companies might never have edited such a record without that kind of sales guarantee. The music is great. Powerfull guitar dominated songs, absurd and furiously humorous lyrics. There are vestiges of The Residents and even Frank Zappa all over the place. Hardcore and Country in karmic harmony. I wanna hear more by Wes, the hyperkinetic-boy."
3,It kicks the crap out of Chocolate Starfish.....,"It's great to see that Wes is capable of doing something other and better than Limp Bizkit, it was a breath of fresh air for him I'm sure. Duke Lion Fights The Terror!! is a very odd and not at all serious effort, and does have its moments. At times you're thinking the Smurfs are guest vocalists on the album, other times you're thinking, ""Bid Dumb Face does death metal?"" The album does move around, does alot of different things, and no song is alike. The real problem with the album is that it gets old fast. I can't say this is an album I would listen to everyday. It's one of those albums you get the feel of, put away, and then remember it in a couple of months, listen to it, like it, then put it away again. Nothing more than that, but it's not a bad album at all. I would prefer Wes just leave Limp Bizkit and dedicate his talents to Big Dumb Face."
3,"WARNING: Not Limp, but something better!","This CD is great! It's far more better than LB. I've been listening to it non-stop since i bought it on March 6th. I suggest that if you like WEEN, or just like funny, heavy,catchy, and retarted music in general, buy this album. If your lookin for Limp, then get the hell out of here and don't buy this album."
1,Big Dumb...just dumb,"First off I'd like to say that I would have given them a zero but you can't. This is the worst cd I've ever heard in my life, Rebel is the most annoying song ever written, and makes me want to stab out my eardrums with a pencil... I hate Limp Bizkit too but Wes should have stayed if he was going to do this..."
4,one weird album,being not a limp fan at first i wasnt even going to bother with this album but i became interested in it after seeing a commercial advertising BIG DUMB FACE. just let me say this is one of the dumbest albums out there. theres humor and odd songs throught out the entire cd. Altgough it is entertaining the album kinda drags on near the end. But i say buy this album if you enjoy oddball kind of music. u will love this album.
3,Laser beams shot from the eyes of the choir!!,"What else is there to say.This album is a joke. The only reason Wes put this out was to prove a point:If I drop a duece into a cd case and put my name on it, it will sell.And well the points been prov'n-BigFIDD"
4,Some freaky stuff!,"Duke Lion is nothing like Limp Bizkit. There is no real way to describe ""Duke Lion"" other than Demented, Tripped out Rock. Wes is letting out his desires and man are they weird. Effects are used on every track. But they're used appropriately. The lyrics are quirky and out there. If you like tripped out music or, are just plain crazy, this cd's for you. But if your haardcore Limp don't buy."
3,11-year olds don't know what they're talking about...,Ummm...one thing...that kid can't spell....and I like the Rebel track.Thank you.
1,"okaaay, I get it","I listened to this album, only one word describes it: WEEEIIIRRRDDD!!!!! This album is ""something"" that Wes wanted to get out of his chest, an ""experiment"" let's say. A complete 180 from the Limp Biskit days. Limp biskit was sissy, with all the rap/rock music, but at least it was acceptable. Man!!!, this CD is weird. I think I'll have a nightmare tonight, with migits dancing around me."
3,"Damn, kick ass Borland","This another one of Borland's works. He has stepped off the Bizkit Train and started this side project. Limp Bizkit is great and I like them. A lot of peolpe think that should ditch Durst and go from there but once you see them live you'll think different. He has stage presence and that counts. Well, back to Wes. He kicks ass and I think any band that his is in will be succesful."
1,A poorman's Mr. Bungle,"This CD is a wannabe Mr. Bungle, Frank Zappa, Naked City, Fantomas etc. mess. Don't waste your time or money on this."
2,WHAT??,"Excuse me is everyone insane!? Almost every review I've read has said this is really good. That's crap, it's horrible to listen to and don't give me that ""well it's funny"", because it isn't, it's just plain BAD. How can you say this is better than Limp Bizkit? They may not be the most talented band ever, but this sounds like a bunch of drunk gay Germans! The only reason I gave it 2 stars insted of 1 is that at least it's original, but we all know orignal is not always good - definitely not in this case."
3,James Joyce,"Informative, accurate, well done. However, for the caliber of the subject, I was dissappointed with the short length of the documentary."
4,a whimsical delight,"Fish Tank Sonata by Arthur Tress contains a whimsical series of photographic images of an antique fish tank placed in unlikely outdoor environments. Kitschy knick knacks and vintage objects create delightful little tableaus inside the tank. Each image is accompanied by poetry, which is unremarkable, but the images more than make up for the text. It's a quirky, unusual picture book, one that I find myself coming back to periodically."
3,Mexico-But not in detail,"I love the Eyewitness Travel Guides, I already have some of them, and because of my great experience with them in Prague, Italy, Russia, and other places, I wanted to get the one for Mexico. But once I got it I was already disapointed by its size being half of the other ones that I got. The regions that interested my most was Guadalajara and Jalisco, which are only described on 2-3 pages, although being the colonial hartland of Mexico. A lot of emphasis is put on Mexico City, and the Jucatan Area. So if you travel there, I can recomend the book. For those who dont like to travel to the typical touristy areas, i'd say rather not."
3,Not exactly what I needed.,"I have purchased several DK Eyewitness Travel Guides through the years to help plan foreign excursions. They have always been most helpful. I was planning a trip to Monterrey, Mexico, so I purchased this guide. The guide has wonderful information on many topics. Monterrey isn't one of those topics. There were three small paragraphs on the third largest city in Mexico, and no restaurant of lodging recommendations. I wasted my money."
5,This book is awesome!,"I love this book! The photos and descriptions of the architecture, landscape, and different cultural regions are right on point. This book makes you want to discover or re-discover Mexico and its treasures. It is definetely a book you can read over and over again. I am very happy I purchased it."
4,Very helpful,"As usual DK's Eyewitness guide for Mexico did not disappoint. Used this at Teotihuacan and Chichen Itza as a guide instead of the ones we purchased there. Love the beautiful photography. I don't mind the lack of information on hotels, etc. since [...] is the best resource for the latest information about booking hotels, etc."
4,The color pictures make this a keeper!,"As with all the Eyewitness travel books, this serves as our guide when we travel internationally. The Mexico book covers the entire country, with a very good overview of sites to see. We used this to plan our trip to Teotihuacan (which we took) and the Mayan ruins near the Yucatan peninsula (which we plan on seeing on a later trip). I think the only thing lacking is that restaurants in the area were not covered in enough detail.Use this guide with online research/travel boards, and you will be able to plan the perfect trip!"
4,Great Work,But this!! You will never hear anything quite like this in your life!! Futuristic music here!! Great work
2,ennui,"Passage's droning delivery and offkilter approach to hiphop is definately in line with the anticon sound. Unlike his peers, Passage lacks the punch that have established Sole, Jel, and Dose. I would definately view him as an anticon junior member...this disc is an attestation to his ever complex struggle for defining himself amidst pressurized beats with 80's samples and self edifying moments of presumed insight. Although this disc isn't horrible, I would this disc only if you are a fan of passage's other work like newbliette (oubliette). The beats, while interesting and bearing that ""lo fi"" asthetic that makes the indy kids sweat, only exacerbates passage's inane sing songy voice. This only works towards his advantage on ""The Unstrung Harp"" where the modal sample and Passage's voice click into place...moments like these are few and far between in my opinion."
3,"Not really very good, but 3 stars for the daughter","Overall, this book rates, I'd say, about 2.5 to 3 stars. The premise is OK: biological mother goes to find her daughter, given up at birth, and gets a position as her nanny, keeping her secret for the time being. The adoptive father is extremely handsome, wealthy & powerful & lives in a beautiful estate. The leads hit the sack too quickly for my taste - drawing out the tension would have been better (the overwhelming attraction thing, I find SO tired out). The character of the teenage daughter was very well written, however, very realistic. Otherwise, this is just a formula Harlequin romance, and there are too many unrealistic situations in the story to make it a keeper."
2,Not What I expected!,This book would be ok if you were a veterinarian. It's not meant for reference..
2,A Great Idea that is very outdated,"I have used and recommended the human version of this book to patients and feel that it is VERY Useful. Jumped at getting the pet version as soon as I ran into it. The concept is great with this version also but, with a copyright date of 1998 it is VERY BEHIND the times and many of the things were not listed or, as someone else pointed out--poorly indexed and hard to retrieve.Good idea but not current enough or indexed well enough. A new version would be a gold mine."
4,Check the date,"I have the earlier edition, and was delighted to see the new publication date and ordered a copy through Amazon.HOWEVER, after it arrived, it appears (from the copyright info) this is a trade paperback edition of the 1998 work - not an updated edition. After suspecting this, I checked the index and failed to find several prescription drugs that I'm currently giving my dogs.This is a good, if dated, reference. If you don't have it, get it. If you have the older edition, avoid the new edition.And I'll be delighted to be corrected on this."
3,Not a new edition,I have the 1998 edition of this book. It is a great resource for any dog or cat owner. I bought this book recently thinking it was a new edition. It is not. It is a new printing only. I would love to see a new edition with drugs from the last 13 years included.
2,Outdated,"Half of my dog medications were not even listed in this book. And we're not taking weird experimental medications here. They are just newer. Heck, some of them aren't even considered newer anymore. This book is missing every pill that has come out after 1998, and that's a problem. They should have revised and updated before re-printing this in 2008.I would buy an updated version in a heartbeat. For the information I could find, it's really good.Edit: I suppose this book is better than nothing. I can't find any other book out there! This is really surprising...."
3,Pet medications,"I bought a copy of it in 1998 and recently got another copy thinking that it was a newer edition. It wasn't. The information is good, but dated."
1,Trading on last book,"This is Sol Stein sucking his success dry. Most of the book is him explainng how brilliant he is and quoting long passages of the authors he dealt with. You would think that he would use a wider range but no, he stays close to his own experiences, which apparently are the height of success. Lots of hype and little information. He has 2-3 pages of checklists which are worth a look, but his earlier books cover the points in more detail and are more practical. Try Sol Stein on Writing."
5,As good as the movie,"I was really excited to receive this in the mail, and it's no wonder! The soundtrack is identical to the film, except for on song (""Now That I'm A Woman""). It all sounds wonderful!"
4,"A very nice soundtrack CD, especially for those with young daughters.","My little girl has loved this movie ever since she was old enough to watch TV, and being able to give her this soundtrack CD was a real treat.Even for an adult, the music is beautiful, especially the title track from America, and the sone ""Now, that I'm a Woman.""Amazon got it to me in less than a week, as always."
5,OH SO GOOD,"I grew up loving this movie as a kid in the late 80s (I was born in 1985). Little did I know until I started college in Boston in 2004 that the music (something I always enjoyed regardless of the unfair review of it on Amazon.com's DVD movie feature) had been turned into a soundtrack. It's completely enthralling, more beautiful than any other soundtrack and utterly amazing. PERFECT IN EVERY WAY...PERIOD."
5,Ah,This cd takes me back to the horrible years of my childhood. The songs reminded me of how it is and how it means to struggle. This is a powerful cd. Please pick it up.
3,It was ok,"The C.D. was scratched in one place and skipped too bad to listen to on one song.It wasn't exactly what I expected,but maybe I wasn't familiar enough with the movie's songs...I just remember thinking I liked the songs on the movie better."
5,Never Ending Beauty,The music for the movie is fantastic.Soft lyrical notes and so forth.You will enjoy this treat of having a simply CD.
4,ENCHANTING,I found this Soundtrack just as enchanting as the film. Who would've thought that a cartoon could touch the soul of man? This CD does just that.
5,Magic lives on,"Magic lives on in our hearts, you can see that from all the movies being released to us. Lord of the Rings and Harry Poter being the newest. But lets not forget the classics. Never Ending Story, Willow,etc,etc. In the hall of magical movies however let us not forget the Cartoon that still haunts our dreams, The Last Unicorn. Sometimes I would sit in art class and the lyrics of this cartoon would shove their way into my heart and mind. I had to find the movie and the soundtrack if there was such a thing. I found it, and I have them both. Thank you Amazon for bringing those days back where as kids my siblings and I would become Lear, and Almalthea and live in a magical world. Buy the Cd, and the Movie and become that kid again."
3,Prices,Purchased this light and several weeks later looked to get a few more. Found that the price had shot up $80! Not sure if this was a mistake. Sure they would not blink at taking the money...
2,Ick.,"I love old Black Flag and am a huge fan of Ginn's often abrasive free jazz influenced punk guitar. But this album doesn't really live up to his reputation. First of all, it sounds sub demo in the production department. And also, it uses a terrible drum machine, which doesn't even sound close to a more modern drum machine sound (it sounds like an early Roland model or something) as well as a godawful mix. The vocals are incomprehensible and buried in the mix. And also, Ginn records EVERYTHING himself, which is a waste because none of the songs seem to have any retaining quality. You're better off buying another GONE (old side project of Black Flag) album from the man than this dismal record."
3,ginn returns to his roots alone !!!!!,"well this would usually get a 5 star review being greg ginn but unfortunatly this is his first effort in 5 years he spent to much time manageing sst records and not playing i think.but his last album before this was the mind shatering ''lets get real gone for a change''. is one to get!!.i think he might of been listening to to much grunge and not enough of his playing.but i will say that his next album ""DICK"" is near perfection as far as what you would expect from ginn.but for all you collectors of the ginns cataloge this album has one of his best songs ""YES OFFICER"".(the only rason for the 3 star review )which happens to be his best police song since ''police story''. but if you dont know that song then you have GONE to far and should start out in the beginning .have you ever heard of the band his first band black flag???"
1,just awful,"when i first popped this in--i bought it for a nickel, to sell at a higher price, so had no intention of keeping it--i was expecting a solid hardcore punk album by the leader of the greatest hardcore punk band of all time, black flag. what i got sounds like bargain bin swedish metal. production is flat and gray, guitar licks are uninspired, and the drums are straight off a stryper record."
2,Poor Locking Mechanism,"This amplifier stand is a great concept and works fairly well, but the plastic locking mechanism (or bottom nut) that holds the three legs open and locked into position eventually wears out rendering the stand useless and unusable. It says it can hold up to 75 pounds, and it likely can, but my 45 pound amp eventually rendered the back leg useless (would no longer lock into position) and I had to trash the stand."
5,Ultimate Support Genesis Amp Stand,I have several of the other heavy steel type amp stands and the Ultimate Support Genesis amp stand beats them hands down.
1,"Breaks, Difficult to Fix, Weak Company Support","This stand broke after a year. I used it for 40-50 gigs with smaller amps (18 w Fenders and a Victoria Regal II). But then it stopped working -- the back leg would no longer lock, so the stand couldn't support an amp. I emailed the company for help and someone called. She sounded familiar with the problem, and said that they could mail me the needed part, if I could drill-out a rivet, replace the part, and then use a rivet gun to put it together again. I don't have a rivet gun. The only alternative was to return the stand to the company on my dime -- about $13 -- so they could decide whether it was a ""manufacturing error"" such that it was ""within warranty."" Even if it was, she said, they would not reimburse me the $13 shipping. The uncertainty, delay and cost is too much. I'm throwing the stand away and buying one from another company. This is not the ""ultimate"" amp stand. It's not even a good one."
1,Terrible sound.... avoid this one!,"I was very disappointed with the inferior quality of the recorded sound in this set. I was looking forward to hearing Gobbi's Don Giovanni, especially with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf as Donna Elvira and Ljuba Welitsch as Donna Anna. This recording was made from a live performance at Salzburg in 1950, with Furtwangler conducting. The overture begins with distortion that's impossible to eliminate, even by adjusting the treble, and things don't get much better as the opera continues. EMI has issued this same performance in the past, and perhaps their source material was better than whatever was used for this remastering, but unless you don't mind substandard sound, steer clear of this one."
4,Its a Start...,"Good introduction book on observing the world around us. It seems like there should be so much more written on this topic.I recommend this book although I admit also that the writer's style can get to you sometimes (however, I wouldn't go so far as to say the author is overly pretentious).Anyway, I also recommend ""The Meadowlands"" if you are interested in this type of book."
2,New Age History,"I had heard Stilgoe on a recent NPR show, and was looking forward to reading his observations about our changing built environment. While there is a smattering of interesting information (i.e., the fact that AC and DC currents once vied with each other in homes), the majority of it is so much fluffy, new agey, and poorly written observations. For the same price, I recommend a much more complete and fascinating book about observing change, ""How Buildings Learn"" by Stewart Brand. It's spectacular."
4,Alot of good insights,"What an interesting book about ""under the rug"" America, the parts of our country... and of each of our communities... that is at the fringe where nobody pays attention, but that has so much to tell us. I especially liked the section about power and what happens when it is improperly grounded... a little scary! The style is a little funky, but if you like this topic, this guy is the best."
1,author has a superior attitude,"The author gives the impression that he is superior to the rest of us - indeed, that he is the only one who notices the skeleton behind everyday things in our environment. Does he really find such desolation of spirit as he bikes around America? I'm glad I read the librarycopyof this book instead of buying it as I had intended to do, based on a review in the New Yorker magazine."
2,187 pages of romantic drudgery,"This book just seems to go on and on about all the little things we seem to miss in this electronic era that we live in, at face value this does have some truth to it, I myself was intrigued by the concept. But right from the very beginning you realize that these are things that are worth forgetting about. The book seems as if it was written for the specific interests of an autistic child.I don't care about the why the grass grows the way it does on the interstate freeway and fail to see why anyone else would either."
5,Comedy and action,"The Northern Italy half of this adventure is one of the more comic of the Young Indy episodes, involving Indy's competition with Ernest Hemingway over a girl. Jay Underwood does a great job as the young Hemingway. Part Two involves Indy's adventures in tracking down traitorous weapons suppliers in World War I Morocco, as well as some questionable flirtation with the much older Edith Wharton."
3,superb fashions-dietrich #1--,"The fashions of the times are superb in this movie Dietrich plays her usual romantic self and shines. I reccommend this film for all who love fashion, jewels and clean humor."
5,One treatment - instant cure,My left foot got infected with staph. I went through three rounds of antibiotics. I saw my GP and a dermatologist. I then saw an infections specialist. My staph infection was gone but my whole foot was covered in a white fungus. She prescribed Lotrimin.One spray. Bingo.
3,"Great content, confusing rules!","I refrained on reviewing this book until after attempting to use its material in my campaign. While the descriptions and information covering the various ships, the enclosed floor plans, and some of the rules regarding capsizing, ramming, and magic are indeed useful, my entire group found the ship vs. ship combat overly cumbersome, confusing, and bogged down by too many charts, tables and rules.Still, I think I would recommend this book to those DMs planning to run adventures or campaigns involving lots of sea travel. Sometimes it's fun to roll on the various tables, or use them for inspiration for new adventures. It has lots of good gems to get the DM's mind rolling."
4,Need that extra idea for extended campaigns?,"This book does an excellent job of decribing in detail all the different ways of traveling over the sea. Every kind of boat you can imagine, including rules on how long, how far, and how well they will survive both in calm waters, the open sea, adrift, or in battle! If you need that extra push to spice up your campaign, get this book and let your party set sail with the next tide."
3,A good start for DMs who to have a live on the ocean wave...,"I personally more interesting in the 'ship' part. It really discribe various kind of ships that could be used in the game. However, it miss out something important:- What is the life aboard? No discription at all. All up to us DMs to find the much needed informations.- For most of the ships, it leak the complete floor plan. Only the main deck area is available.By the way, if you and your player wants to have a live on the ocean wave, this is the one that you can't afford to miss."
4,Great fun for a first effort,"This is really a fun blend of the two music traditions, but has that sound of a studio album more than a band album, like the musicians were pulled in to play their part rather than having honed their interaction in extensive live performance. There are lots of pyrotechnics but not a lot of subtle ""inside"" interaction going on that can keep a recorded performance fresh through repeated listenings. I have no doubt that their live performances are now awesome; I would relate it to when I saw J-L Ponty tour with the West African group and was totally blown away only to find that the album was merely really good (as this one is). It's a subtle thing, but behind the really terrific performances on this disc I don't feel the emotional ""alchemistry"" that keeps me going back to my very favorite artists (Coltrane, for instance, or Chaurasia, or Marley). But you can't fault these folks for the energy they put into this pretty powerful first release!"
3,The Perfect System,"Drum beats and bass rhythms played by African musicians, vocals, reeds, and strings by Irish. It's an odd combination that grows stronger and more comfortable upon repeated listenings. It sounds as if two wandering grouos of widely disparate musicians met, listened to each others work, then banded together to highlight their best. It's easy to imagine exciting (if complex) dances performed to these songs; the styles complement each other well and each track is given plenty of time to develop."
2,Like bad Deep Forest,"Major disappointment compared to Volume 2 - which is outstanding. Basically sounds like any old ""World Music"" without the enveloping overlayed drums, rhythms and sounds of Vol 2. This album is minimally ""techno"" for those who like a more organic sound."
5,A true world music fusion.,"After the first listening of The Afro Celt Sound System I was blown away. Finally an album that sucessfully fuses two fine ""world music"" traditions, Celtic strings and African rythym sections, sprinkled with just enough techno to keep things interesting. The music just draws you in deeper and deeper with its tantalizing rythyms and energetic performances. A ""must"" for any true world music fan."
4,"Excellent overview, but a bit narrow","Herlihy has done a masterful job of detaling the daily life of most Europeans during the middle ages, exploring gender roles and the various ""chores"" a household had to tend to as the seasons changed. It provides an outstanding overview of the complex and labor intensive work of survival during this period of time. However, I found it a bit narrow in terms of the time period it covered. The ""middle ages"" last over 1000 years - from around 500 AD (the ""early middle ages"") to the ""late middle ages"" (ending around 1450). In the course of such a long period of time, even in the middle ages, tasks, roles and habits change. This is not fully addressed, as the majority of the book discusses households in the ""high"" (800 - 1200) middle ages. Nonetheless, an excellent introduction to the subject."
3,Not What I'd Hoped,"I'm always hunting for new books on life in the middle ages, so when I saw this title, written by an oft-cited authority on all things medieval, I bought it. What I hoped for was a thorough and clear description of how people, rich and poor, lived in a world very unlike ours. What I read was almost a medieval accounting manual: how much great lords and ladies spent on this, that and the other thing. Great for scholars; for me, not so good. Details were plentiful, but not the type I wanted. Chalk it up to ignorance on my part. If you're a researcher into how a great household spent its money and allocated its many servants and non-human resources, this one's a good find."
5,Same old songs,"Sure, I love all of these songs. I love the Osmond family but what is here that hasn't been available before? I want the original albums or at least a compilation of songs from 1976-1979. This is great for newcomer fans but what about the people who really are interested in Osmond music! It's amazing that you can purchase original albums from one or two hit wonders but when it comes to a family who have an all-around entertainment background can't get the proper respect and recognition they deserve!"
3,SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING,"THE CD ON THE WHOLE WAS FAIRLY GOOD==BUT SOME OF THE SONGS DID NOT SOUND LIKE THE ORIGINALS (ie. Donny's voice was not high enough and the familiar ""tone"" of the original is non-existent)SOMEWHAT OF A DISSAPOINTMENT=too bad!!!"
5,Great Collection,"This is probably the only Osmond collection you need if you're and Osmond fan. A great selection of their hits, an excellent compliation."
4,A Little Nostolgia?,"If you were a teenage girl during the 70's and are looking for music that brings back those feelings of fun, this is the album for you. My sister was a huge fan of these kids and when I saw this CD I just knew that she would love it. I got it for her Birthday and she went nuts. She remembered every line of every song. It was a great gift for her."
5,"Osmondmania ""The Osmond's Greatest Hits""",It was for my wife. She asked for it and she seems to really like it.
1,"Nothing new. An ""F"" for Originality.",Being an Osmond fan can be very frustrating at times... This CD has nothing new to offer. There have been several Osmond compilation CDs in the past 10 years. What's so different about this one besides the photograph on the cover? Nothing. I agree with the reviewer who wishes the Osmonds would put some of their old albums on CD instead of putting out hit compilation CDs all the time. Been there. Done that. Bored to tears.
3,Cesalpino: was he the first person to describe the blood circulation,"This is a rather evangelical discussion of the place in history of Cesalpino. He probably was the first person to describe the systemic circulation, and subsequent discoveries of Harvey were likely in the light of knowledge of Cespalinos writings.The style is both academic and journalese: a strange combination. But still a must for anyone interested in the history of medicine and the circulation in particular."
5,A Classical Christmas,This is one of the best Classical Christmas Albums that I have ever heard. We had purchased the Album many years ago and anxiously awaited its release on CD. What a delight when I browsed on artist and saw this CD listed. I am buying it today to add to my Christmas Collection. The music is so calming and the vocals exquisite. Definitely a must for all who enjoy the Classical touch in Christmas music.
2,Avoid This Set,"I was greatly disappointed with this highly tauted set. The performances are (just) OK, but the sound quality is so bad you can't hear anything anyway. Stick with Jarvi on Chandos for a complete set."
1,don't buy this set,"Oh my god, this isn't a race! I started with the first symphony and I couldn't go on.. Indeed, gerviev is a terrible conductor of prokofiev; the tempi is too fast, taking the breath of the music."
2,"Dude, Slow Down!","First, I'm a big big Valery Gergiev fan. His Shostakovich and Stravinsky recordings are just incredible in so many ways and the Prokofiev Romeo & Juliet (complete ballet) with the Kirov Orchestra beats even Pletnev's by a hair. However, I actually wondered if my CD player was having issues or that maybe an error during mastering had occurred because these readings are way too fast. Is it possible these performances are truer to Prokofiev's intent than others and I have just been conditioned incorrectly? Maybe, but man these are in a hurry. Immediately after enduring Symphony No. 3, I listened to Jarvi's version with Scottish National just to cleanse and reorient. Then I needed to fully enjoy the third so I let Ricardo Chailly's Decca recording of the third with Royal Concertgebeouw wash over me and restore the passion I have for Prokofiev.I just don't think these tempos work in any way."
2,Not as advertised,"This CD is not as advertised on the Internet. It is not a Lucky Strike Hit Parade CD. The picture on the CD is very much misleading and a lie. The actual CD that was sent to me is part of a decade of pop songs from 1954 put out by Time-Life. It has nothing to do with the radio or TV show of Lucky Strike presents your Hit Parade. Where in the world did they get that phony picture of a ""Lucky Strike"" wrap around to put on the cover of the CD? Bob"
4,Good diversity,"This book was assigned for school, but it gives a great survey of ecclesiologies that lie within the body of Christ. We as a body are definitely diverse and this book outlines just some of the ecclesiologies that show our diversity."
4,One of the best Kinks histories I've read,"This must be the most complete history of the Kinks I've read. It looks to such sources as the autobiographies of Ray and Dave Davies and attempts to give a full picture of the group and its trials and travails and idiosyncrasies. (For instance, Ray and Dave do not discuss in their books how annoyingly cheap they are, but this book does.) The one irritating element of this book for a Kinks fan like myself is how critical it is of the post-1960s Kinks."
4,Worth the Read!,"The book is complete and if you aren't a die hard Kink fan you probably will become one. While I was reading the book, I had to buy a couple of CD's that had songs I hadn't heard. Boy was I pleased I did. The book hints at alot of errors made by them and their management. If you give their music a good hard listen you can see something was wrong with their machine. What a catalog of great music. Good book, great story, a historic and ground breaking band."
4,The Young Wan,"Brendan O'Carroll's The Young Wan shows the beginnings of the matricarch of the Browne Family. Agnes marriage to the Redster is explained in all of its colorful history in this installment. This prequel offers the same deadpan humor that helps the Irish navigate through their poverty as the Trilogy. This light hearted if not at times tragic novel will have reader laughing, crying and marveling at the strength of friendship and family."
2,Before Mrs Brown.,"I thought it would have been as funny as Mrs Brown's boys, but I was disappointed.I had an idea that it was the early days of Agnes Brown but I still kept on hoping for a laugh or two.Brendan I'm still waiting."
3,"Poor Writing, Interesting Characters","Contrary to what others think, I found the writing to be decidedly amateurish. I spent years reading and correcting pulp-like fiction written by high school students; this book takes me back to those stacks of stories. The vocabulary is repetitive; some sentences are run-on; the tense is weak (""...the siren was screaming...,"" ""...the man was spitting at...,"" ""Bosco was running hard...""); the grammar is sometimes unusual (""...went to follow...,"" ""...he..made after the other men...""); and occasional slang seems inappropriate (""...a wino...""). There is a too-obvious effort to try to imitate speech patterns. And there are certainly trite and overused descriptions of people: the Irish as the sterotype."
