5,The squirrels chirp back.,"This call works. I can't say that enough. If the squirrel is on the wrong side of the tree, bark and he will be visible."
4,Great singing,The 2 leads have spectacular voices but the guy who plays Populescu (Harald Serafin) cannot sing at all and is just played for laughs. Also the dancers in animal costumes during the overture has to be one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen! The subtitles are not that helpful (except for the spoken dialog) because the English is forced to rhyme and loses a lot of the meaning of the original German.
5,Pravana hair paste,"I love this hair paste! It is no longer available to me at my local hairdresser, so I am very pleased to be able to get it through my favorite website, Amazon.com."
3,Why mp3?,"Allies is a band that needs to be made available on CD, perhaps a 2-fer... three of them. This one should be paired with Long Way From Paradise. I've got the cassette and it sounds as good as a cassette can (it was recorded on high-bias medium), but its a shame that this is not out on CD... or at least a nice lossless digital file with artwork.I give the recording 4 stars, the fact that it is only available as an mp3 (I prefer ogg vorbis for lossy and you really shouldn't transcode a lossy format to another lossy) gets a half star. Average it out to a 3 star rating."
3,Surf rack,The Bike Hopper Rack makes it easy to carry a body board on your bike. I used a backpack carrier and found it difficult to ride with a head wind. The rack should come with mounting clips.
3,From Back Cover,"One look at the ravishing red-haired beauty and Brigham Langston was captivated. But through Serena MacGregor had the face of an angel, she was a wildcat who spurned his advances with a rapier-sharp tongue. To hot-tempered Serena, Bringham was just another Englishman to be despised. But in the arms of the dashing and dangerous English lord, the proud Scottish beauty's hatred soon melted with the heat of their passion"
3,Too Predictable!,"The character of Serena MacGregor never is fully developed, she spends too much time waiting for Brigham. I really enjoyed the whole Macgregor series, but this story was not as good."
3,not as good as others,"didn't enjoy the book as much as the others in the macgregors series. it was still good, though. fast delivery and the book was in great shape."
4,I was surprised how much I liked Bradley Cole's music,"The lyrics along with Cole's restrained passion make for an electric combination. Although the tempo of most of the songs is upbeat, there is an undercurrent that is reminiscent of the desperation that comes from a last ditch effort. The result is a curious mixture that piques the ear. His voice is not the smoothest and the production is not the cleanest, but in a natural (organic) way it's just what the album called for. It's a mixture which calls the listener back again and again to pull the elements apart and marvel at the artistry behind the album."
1,This DVD is NOT NTSC format!,"In product detail, the format of this DVD is shown as NTSC, which is compatible with TV sold in the US. However, the DVD I received was ""PAL"" format, which is standard in Europe but NOT compatible with TV sold in the US. Please be careful!"
1,Country Bees,"This is NOT the Honeybees from the early 1960's.This is a modern (2005) country group.They sound like The McGuire Sisters doing country, backed by a Les Paul style guitar.If you like country music, you may like this group."
3,A Flawed Collection of Hit,"There is already a very fine review of this CD here on Amazon, but I would like to add the following comments. The songs ""Shutters and Boards"", ""Primrose Lane"",the original version (there are two included) of ""There She Goes"" and ""In the Misty Moonlight"" all play at the wrong speed. These songs run about 10 to 12 seconds fast. Not quite like the Chipmunks, but if you play the vinyl versions at the same time, you can hear that the pitch is higher and the songs keep getting farther out of sync. There may be others, but these were the only ones I could confirm in an A/B test. If you have forgotten the way the originals sound, you may not be bothered too much by this, but it still makes him sound a bit strange. That said, it is really hard to find a solid collection of his early hits and this set does meet some of that need."
5,my favorite album,"this is recorded in a huge cathedral and the cello and piano resonate in stirring ways - apparently improvised, there is a wonderful and tuneful interplay between the two artists - its lively, touching, exciting, quiet - each track is excellent"
3,Decent,"I bought this product thinking it would not really require gluing, and would easily snap together. This was not the case, however, and I ended up having to use a lot of the included tube of super glue to put it together. After the annoying construction, though, the windmill worked pretty well. It is more like a desk toy so I wouldn't really recommend it for $40. It is amusing, the windmill turns when the solar battery on the top of the structure is exposed to a light bulb, but $40 was a little much. I wouldn't buy this unless I needed it for some sort of experiment (the reason i bought it), or if i really needed a model of a modern windmill for some reason."
1,Not worth it,"This CD is just a collection of software that can be found on the internet. And most of it is shareware, which means you have to pay extra to use it."
1,There are much better products out there!,"I was rather dissapointed after receiving my order for this item. After an installation onto my computer that was less than smooth (it crashed Windows), I began to navigate through the various Palm utilities. To my surprise, most of these utilities were shareware programs. To legally use any of them, it is necessary to pay a fee to the company that originally created the software. (In other words, I paid for this CD, and I'd have to pay again to use the software!) There are much better Palm utilities available-this is one to skip!"
1,VERY MISLEADING! NOT FULL LICENSED SOFTWARE!,"This is a CD full of ""try-out"" shareware applications, not the full versions! Not worth even if you PAID ME!"
1,Worthless ~ Where is my rebate,"I've been waiting on my rebate for over three months now, they delayed the payout date again until February. Little use for the software and bogus rebate. BEWAREBTW -- this is shareware, you still have to pay AGAIN to get to use the software on this CD."
3,It pays to read the not-so-fine print...,"Useful for someone (1) with a slow connection, or (2) who doesn't have the time and/or inclination to chase these programs down, or (3) who'd like to have the shareware on a CD - otherwise fairly useless.The product review does state that ""the easy-to-use installation interface ALLOWS YOU TO TRY OUT these utilities, visit the developer's Web site, and view the program manual"" (caps added for emphasis). Obviously, the key words being ""try out"". It pays to read the descriptions and reviews VERY carefully!"
1,"Okay utilities, but the rebate is still missing...","Basically, the utilities were pretty useless, with one or two exceptions..."
1,Great Programs,it is great to have these programs because there are useful for my handspring visor platinum organizer.
5,Brilliant as always.,"The CD is amazing and my favorite song on it has to be the last mix for ""One Day"" we reminds me of the X-Files theme. The Come to Me remixes are also very good."
3,Needs Updating,"This book is about Picasa Version 2 when Version 3 is now available. There are changes between the versions. It is very difficult for a new user when what the book says is different than what is on the computer. Until the book is updated, it is not as helpful as it could be."
2,Picasa,"Book is dated; New version is Picasa 3, but most of the information is relevant. Some of the procedures lack detail and are difficult to follow."
4,Good for a new user,This guide is good for someone new to Picasa. I was a little disappointed that more in depth subjects were not included. I was more like the For Dummies series but with even less content. Good quick reference but will have to search further for a more advanced reference.
3,Very Basic,I returned this book. Picasa is so easy to use that few people will need a Visual Quick Start Guide. The Quick Start series is good but this program just doesn't warrant a guide at all.
3,Filter not made by Bionaire,"Realize when you buy this, that this filter is not made by Bionaire. It is adequate, and it fits the Bionaire Clear-Mist humidifier, but it is a cheap-looking filter, as opposed to the Bionaire filter that came with the humidifier. In my opinion, it is too expensive for what it is."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I only used this lens two weeks before it drove me crazy trying to get it to turn out a good shot. After about 50% zoom the distortion and other aberrations become unbearable. It didn't really seem to increase my zoom level that much either. I could zoom in almost as much, and have a better picture, by sticking with my wide angle lens on a macro lens. If you're looking for a good telephoto lens, don't go cheap like I did and get this. Save up for something higher quality and with a higher lens multiplication."
5,Not your typical hardcore........,"The minute I heard samples from the two Death By Stereo albums, I knew I was looking at a great, talented band. Death By Stereo's singing/screaming style might seem skeptical at a first listen. (One might think they have no talent whatsoever). In fact, Death By Stereo has amazing talent. Who else can blend the high energy, harmonic intensity of Punk with the screaming solos and ballad styles of Metal. Death By Stereo's guitar playing style can be compared to many metal bands complete with the soloing. But the energy, and intensity of punk rock is still there; alive and kicking. Death by Stereo is definitely intense, but harmonic and mellow at times. It's not just a bunch of yelling, and not your typical hardcore band. And there's no way you could say that Death By Stereo songs sound exactly the same. Old punk fans and new punk fans alike will need to check out this band."
2,"Not horribly BAD, just not good either...","The aspects of the story that concern the antiques trade and the madness of Brimfield are interesting enough. I found the rest of the book to be very ho-hum -- there wasn't a single character who was particularly compelling or likable, and the story is mostly predictable and dull. I just didn't care what happened to any of these people.And, I hate to be too English-majory, BUT...WHO edited this book? Anybody? The number of typos, as well as all the times that the wrong form of ""it's"" or ""their"" is used, is just embarrassing. The biggest editing problem is the persistant pronoun confusion, with all the sentences that say ""She was so happy to see her that she called out her name and she smiled as she poured her a glass of wine and...""I know the spelling and grammar stuff are picky complaints. Maybe if the book had been *interesting*, my attention would have been drawn to the story rather than the typos."
1,Possibly the worst book ever written,"We have all had the experience of reading a book that speaks to our own experience, and identifying with it. Doubtless, this is such a book for some people, as evidenced by the other reviews. However, on its own merits, this book is simply horrible. The premise is ridiculous, the characters are unbelievable, and the story is internally inconsistent. The writing is so bad it could be a cariacture (remember Snoopy typing ""It was a dark and stormy night""?) and the editing (as noted by another reader) is non-existent. For anyone who has ever been to Brimfield, it is obvious that the depiction in the book is completely unrealistic.I am a big fan of a good story without requiring that it have ""redeeming social value."" Colleen McCollough is a good example of this kind of writer. But I do want my beach novels to be well written, and this one is anything but."
2,Reader Beware!,"The premise of the book - that people search for objects to complete themselves - was of thought provoking. The author's style, however, was far too overdone for my tastes. He repeated characteristics of both people and places, far too many times. How many times can he refer to Brimfield as ""the ultimate one-night stand"" -- I got it the first time."
4,A little pricey but cool toy,My 7 year old loves automoblox...they are well made and durable. They seem a bit expensive but on the flip side will probably last a lot longer than some of his other toys that are similar to these. I would definitely recommend them for any young boys who are into cars!
3,mildy disappointed,"Got these for my boys after trying the larger ones at a playdate. The full size ones are impressive but you really need to have about 3 cars at least to have fun. If you're not familiar with Automoblox, the car dissembles into quite a few pieces; the cab, tires and body all come apart - then they can be re-arranged as creatively as desired. I got the minis so that we would have a few cars to re-arrange. Three of the full size cars would probably be close to $90 which I think is a lot. The minis are fun, but I felt that the pieces were very cheaply made compared to the full size cars which felt very durable. Don't think I will be buying any more of these minis."
4,a lot of fun,we got manhattan toy mini pack for our 5 year old son for christmas. The cars are acutally a nice size and he has really enjoyed taking them appart and mix and matching the components. The cars seem to be well made.
3,Not too many parts to assemble,"It looks too basic for a 4 year old. I wish it had more parts to assemble to make it more interesting. I think these cars looked cuter in the Amazon pictures than in real life. It's a Christmas present and it's not Christmas yet,so we'll see whether it's a hit."
5,Is there life after Boswell?,"According to John Boswell's book, Christianity, Social Tolerance and Homosexuality, the Christian tradition was not anti-gay until the late middle ages. Professor Brooten's book makes us revisit that argument and rethink the hegemony of Boswell's thesis in gay circles. Her critique of Boswell's reading of Romans 1 is telling and accurate.Brooten's book is a very tight and carefully argued presentation of Christian tradition as anti-gay and (especially) anti-lesbian from the outset. The wider context of this argument is fascinating. It includes translations of spells and other original material never seen before. No one interested in gay or lesbian history can neglect this study!"
4,Shoegazing grunge or grungy shoegazing,"If you like 90's indie/alternative rock, you'll probably like this EP. You hear elements of hard rock, glam, goth, and a few more influences thrown into the mix and the end result is not bad-- better than average mid-to-late 90's indie rock. A couple of the tracks are weak, but the rest are pretty solid."
3,good but has some problems,"I had some problems with this item. The tabs are printed on clear plastic that are held in place on a backing sheet. You then remove a row of tabs and apply them to the actual divider pages, all 5 at a time. I found that sometimes when you tied to lift-up the tabs from the backing some of the backing paper came along with it making it so you could not adhere the tabs to the dividers.I also found that the tabs are very ""printer"" sensitive, they did not like my fancy laser printer preferring my far cheaper ink-jet printer. When you have an equal quantity of tab pages to divider pagers with no option to buy just the tab pages, any printing error renders both unusable, this is a real problem for such an expensive product.Additionally Avery's label software, DesignPro, is cumbersome and although usable on a Mac, not very Mac friendly and I feel not much better on a PC."
2,Sorry; A Skip For Me.,"the pop of tiamat's works, I could call this album ""a failed attempt at stoner rock"" somewhat with not so pleasing vocals and not that good music. not my style at all..a deeper kind of slumber go go go."
1,Difficult to believe,"I'm tired of seeing the best doom/death acts turn goth all of the time. Sure, it works with some acts, but Tiamat? As far back as Wildhoney, I have been disappointed with their musical tangents into the progressive realm as they didn't seem to pull it off well. I still had hope, however, until the release of ""Skeleton Skeletron"". . . now all I hear is poorly presented gothic music with little redeemable musicianship anywhere within. It's little more than gothic garbage. Listen to Xymox, or Diabolique, but please: if you see this album in the record store, pass it up."
2,Tiamat - gift from Sweden,"I am a big Tiamat fan, but this aint good record. Ideas are boring and atmosphere is too static. There are couple good songs, that`s all...Buy first ""deeper kind of slumber"", ""wildhoney"" or ""judas christ"". Also ""clouds"" is brilliant but style is raw...depends what kind of music u are expectecing...Juha Kainulainen, Finland"
3,Not the greatest successor,"And this is the successor to the masterpiece. What happend? Where's the melody, where are the guitars, where's the mood of 'a deeper kind of slumber', or 'Wildhoney'. If you liked those two, I can't guarantee that you'll enjoy this one. It definetly has quite a few positive moments. But actually that's probably the main flaw of this album: it's too positive. It doesn't have that deep philosophically-sophisticated atmosphere as that of 'a deeper kind of slumber'. It sounds kinda 'funny'. Especially annoying are pop-like female vocals in a couple of songs. Why doesn't Edlund find a new girlfriend to brake up with, since that's what brings his talent to it's peak. And he certainly could've done better than this!And yet it is enjoyable to listen sometimes. Unless it really drives you nuts, when you know exactly what's missing at one particular place. I am looking forward to the next one, and hope that it'll be more 'Wildhoney'-like, but that seems unlikely to happen."
2,What happened?,"I'm not sure what Tiamat is trying to do here. If anyone enjoyed the lovely intracacies and atmospherics of Wildhoney and A Deeper Kind of Slumber will be quite surprised with this one. I'm just wondering what happened to the guitar. It seems they decided to put the vocals in the forefront. This would be fine except Johan Edlund doesn't have much variety or range in his vocal abilities. I would say the one highlight of the album was The Church of Tiamat. This did bring back a few memories of the Tiamat I appreciate. This album will definitely not hurt any of their commerial appeal in Europe. Hopefully, the next album will continue on with their progression from A Deeper Kind of Slumber."
5,"No multiplayer, but...","Love this game as I did the first one. Actually this is even better as it adjusts to the level of your player, but I am used to playing ,multiplayer as well, and that is not an option!!!! I hope it comes soon.Wonderful game:-)"
5,A view of Huichol culture in the 1930's,"This book presents translations of some of the stories of the Huichol people as they were told to one of the first anthropologists to spend time with them. There are the usual errors of interpretation that you will find with an outsider looking in on an indigenous culture, but this text provides a rare look at these stories in a format that is close to the original."
1,Yawn...,"This book is boring. It was written by an 18-year-old aspiring literary agent who only wrote it to get her foot in the door. The way I see it, she's going to need bandages for all five toes, because the plot is underdeveloped, the characters are transparent, and the flow is poor. Save yourself the trouble of self-inflicting pain."
1,not at all what I expected,"The book has hardly any validity and it's not what I expected at all. This gentleman did not do his homework. Throughout the book it states that fascism in Italy did not exist but then it states that Hitler used Italian fascism as a model for his politics, this kind of oxymoron is not the only silly thing about this book....keep your money and buy something that actually explains history as it truly happened not as in someone's fantasy world"
4,From a teacher...Great supplemental information! Great Price!,"This little workbook is a wonderful addition to ANY Spanish curriculum...it adds plenty of vocabulary in the form of nouns, verbs, adjectives, you name it! The lesson explanations aren't TOO thorough, so I wouldn't depend on it for my student's first experience with the language, but as a review, for this price, I haven't seen ANYthing better than this!Lots of pictures to color, lots of words to write and learn, some games, and even little rhymes and songs!If you're sketchy on Spanish pronunciation, you might have trouble with this little book, there's no phonetic spelling throughout, but a small pronunciation guide on the first few pages.For a full curriculum workbook (weekly lessons, worksheets, and flashcards), try Flip Flop Spanish, which DOES come with a CD."
3,Good for Collectors,"I give this three stars, taking away two for the bad sound quality. It sounds like music on a cheap AM radio in the next room.Don't get me wrong. The performances are great, and every Ra album is important.I especially like the rare vocal version of ""China Gate,"" hitherto available on the studio ""Futuristic Sounds"" album issued a year later, in 1961. ""China Gate"" is a kind of Vaughn Monroe thing, but Ra was into exotic foreign settings at that time, like some of Les Baxter's records. It's historically interesting in retrospect because Ra was so avant garde elsewhere.If you are not a collector, you are better off buying any of the 15 or so excellent CDs issued by Evidence Records and available from Amazon."
1,The World of Inferior Recordings,"The Arkestra was evolving in these vintage performances, but the terrible sound quality diminish the impact.The tape sources for the octet at Majestic Hall and sextet at Wonder Inn sound as if they came from the audience and was ultimately for a private collection. There is absolutely no way that Sun Ra - or any artist - would have permitted the ragged bootleg quality for release immediately after the performances.Only for those seeking a complete catalog of ""official"" Sun Ra releases, the CD is a frustrating aspect of labels issuing material with inferior sound quality for supposed ""historical"" purposes."
4,"Oh, if only it sounded a little cleaner...","While the recording quality of these shows leave a lot to be desired, the music is inspired nonetheless. A great window into the variety and energy that made up Sun Ra shows (as I understand them, being far too young to have actually seen one)."
4,dark and moving,moving music . Stings most underrated album I think.Why should I Cry For You is excellent as is the title track.
1,Caveat Emptor,While the movie it self is a classic the DVD leaves much to be desired. I was disapointed to find that the DVD was in full screen as opposed to the wide screen I prefer. It also received no treatment whatsoever on the transfer. The titles are shakey as well as the picture. If i had to guess they transfered right from a video tape found at a local video store. If i had it to over again I would have stuck to my copy on VHS and spent my money on something else.
4,Hysterical,"I think this is a classic for all horror movie lovers. It is a parady of most horror movies made in the 60's and 70's. If you Like movies such as Airplane! , Transylvania 6-5000, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, Top Secret, or the Files from Police Squad, this is another movie you need to have, or need to see."
5,Hysterical,"Like parodies?Great lines that stick in your head?So many laughs you'll be sore for hours?WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE!!This is a funny, funny movie that parodies quite a few hit movies... from Indiana Jones to Amytville (spelling? - can't remember). And lines that stick in your head for years, everytime you think of them will make you smile, and laugh all over again. All that and it's a musical too!This movie is so stupid it is just like the name ""Hysterical"""
3,Fritz........your pants are down!,"I saw this movie many years ago on HBO and thought it was a riot! This is a very silly movie that won't appeal to everyone. However, if you like movies that are 'so bad, it's good' then give this a try. C'mon, what other movies have apathetic zombies?"
3,HYSTERICAL,THIS IS NOT THE GREATEST MOVIE BUT I'VE SEACHED LONG AND HARD TO FIND IT TO GIVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER AS A GIFT BECAUSE SHE LOVED THIS MOVIE. SO I WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND IT AND GET IT A COUPLE DAYS AFTER I PURCHASED IT.
4,Good and silly,"This movie isn't Shakespeare, but it is awfully amusing. Growing up, my mother found this movie somewhere and, like most boys between 10-15, I could watch it over and over again. Since then, it holds a special place in my heart, but I did go back recently and watch it again and I still found it pretty amusing (so it isn't a matter of me favoring this movie for nostalgic reasons). It's full of visual puns and silly dialogue and ridiculous plot threads, but I would still recommend it to anyone who can avoid taking it too seriously."
5,Quick and non damaged,Order came in very quick and was exactly what I wanted. The product looked untouched and the quality was great.
1,Not 1st Edition as Picture Suggests,"It was quick, but it was no 1st Edition. If it's not 1st edition, it shouldn't have a picture of a 1st Edition Pack.... Take a picture of the actual product or specify that it's not 1st Edition.... That kind of makes or breaks it...."
3,Always Thinking.......,Not a bad album. Chris Philips has some good freestyle tunes here. The music on a whole is not bad but I find Alexia's singing to be a little much for me at times.
5,Crash Collector's Edition,Crash bandit is an old game that I love to play. I enjoy playing and I am proud to own.
5,¡Ay caramba! ¡Magnifico!,I encountered the music of Alex Ubago during my summer in Spain. He is absolutely INCREDIBLE! I love the music soooo much and it helps remind me of my AWESOME summer in Valencia.
5,Fantastic Debut!!!,"Here we see Alex coming onto the scene with his first album. Unlike many POP artists who are just plain attention seekers. he wrote music for many famous artists in the Latin musical scene over the last couple of years now. It's amazing the he only came into singing after his girl-friend Amaia Montero of ""La Orja De Van Gogh"" convinced him to start a singing career. And what we see here is the result of some hard dedication that will indeed will show him no shame at all whatsoever because he produced the cuts on this album. From the opening riff number ""Qur Pides Tu?"", the Spanish guitar inpired ""A Gritos de Esperanza"" to ""Dime Si Es Amor"" we see him gliding through rock, pop and Spanish inspired music. And it feels very relaxed and he;s having fun doing it too! Making this one of the most listen friendly albums I've heard as a debut. A very well done to you Alex Ubago! This album will surely please for both adults and teens. I can't wait for his next album..."
5,"I LOVE THIS CD, ITS JUST TOO GREAT TO DESCRIBE!!","This cd is one of the best cds I have heard lately. All the songs from the begining to the end are so beautiful. You will fall in love with the songs since the first time you heard them, and if you understand spanish the meaning of the songs is just incredible. I have listened the cd, and keep listening again and again and the more I listen to it, the more I like it. Its a must have!!"
3,Missing Book Description,"Setting Colonial AustraliaPrisoner of love...High-spirited Nadine Quinn's apprehension about her family's move to Australia quickly vanished when handsome Lloyd Harpster won passage on her father's boat for the long voyage. Swept off her feet by the charming Australian, Nadine struggled with theirgrowing love-for Lloyd was a wanted man.Forced to watch helplessly as Lloyd was arrested and imprisoned by the notorious Captain Grenville, Nadine vowed to set him free. But could she trust her heart to the daring bushranger-or was their love just . . . a Passion in the Wind?"
4,Carfax Abbey rocks!,"Ok this music is sortof industrial style, I really dont know how to categorize it. They definately rock. I am from NEW JERSEY and so is the band, I have seen advertise around the clubs but never got a chance to see their show. So a friend of mine turned me on to them, I bought the CD. Definately good listening! Keeps my mind off the terrible New Jersey constant state of traffic jam in the car. If your looking for a rush of adrenaline? This is your ticket (and well, maybe some decent partying lol)"
4,Music to relax by,David Koz and his producer manages a blend of saxaphone jazz theme melodies and pertinent lyrics from memoriable movies creating a fresh sound to old stand-bys. This CD is for easy listening and best reserved for those mornings when you want to relax and when you want to ease into your day or when on a driving trip.Ronald & Marjorie Buccilli
2,At the Movies - needs a movie............,"I absolutely love ""The Dance"". I was expecting the same with this release and I am greatly disappointed. The idea of re-making classics works, but the remakes were not that new or exciting."
3,Heavy on the schmaltz,I am a big fan of Dave Koz and have been for years but I find this new release a bit heavy on the schmaltzy/cheezy side. There is a lot of string laden arrangements which make it very sappy in general. I love the tunes and the guest vocalists are a treat but I just wish it sounded more like it would if he were doing the tunes live (without a huge orchestra behind him.)
1,Not Worth The Price Of Admission - Boring,"I don't know what disappointed me more about this CD - the cliched collection of well-worn movie musical chestnuts that we've heard a million times each or the dull, unoriginal arrangements that makes listening to them even more of a chore. Dave is a popular guy with the girls and lures Donna Summer, Anita Baker, India.arie, and Vanessa Williams along for this slow boat to nowhere and a couple of (gay like him) guys, Barry Manilow and Johnny Mathis as well. All of them provide serviceable performances which do little than push Dave into the background and distract from his languid sax playing.If your Lunesta or Sominex isn't working, this CD could be a good non-pharmacological alternative to get you to sleep."
2,Atrocious,"I purchased this CD on Dave Koz's and Phil Ramone's reputation alone. I must say this is the WORST CD ever. Dave Koz might be a pretty face, but falls into the same pitfalls as Kenny G...actually I would've rather preferred Kenny G to this nonsense. India.arie, Anita Baker, and Vanessa Williams, artists that I love, just ""phone in"" their performances. Something that Phil Ramone should remember from doing those Frank Sinatra ""Duet"" albums. Dave Koz, instead of performing the entire melody of Cinema Paradiso, plays some sort of improv until the last minute or so of the song. Also, Barry Manilow is competent enough to perform to Moon River, and does a good job, but has to fight with the terrible sax solos. Donna Summer tries to do her best, but you feel she is holding back, or that Dave Koz is limiting her to make room for his obnoxious solos. Uugh...bland and terrible. The Pink Panther theme seems to work, but not for the whole 3 and some awful minutes. Steer clear of this one folks."
5,Beautiful Music,"This is a wonderful CD. It is warm and lush and I enjoyed every song. My only regret is that there aren't more songs on the album. Each song brought back wonderful memories from the movies they are from. If you're a movie music lover, you'll enjoy this disc. If you're a Dave Koz fan, you won't be disappointed."
5,Awesome Cd,Dave Koz does it again with his sax playing his awesome groove with his sax. All thoses Artist appearing on his new rel are just awesome a excellent choice in singers & musicians as well. Id hurry out & get this cd as quikly as you can. Id give this cd 10 stars over all. George
4,Non-Album Track!,"""If I Didn't Care"" does not appear on ""As Time Goes By."" For the true fan, this is worth buying just to get another song from Ferry."
1,Pile of hot horse crap.,Rubbish. I thought it was about historical Rome. I wouldn't watch this movie for free. I quit after 10 mins. Can I rate it 0/5.
2,If you need sleep!,"If you find yourself unable to sleep , put this DVD in your player! This movie give new meaning to drag. Don't waist your time!"
2,Couldn't get into Coriolanus,"I normally don't like the modernized versions of Shakespeare (accept for Romeo and Juliet) and this one just doesn't work for me. It has stellar actors in it, but there isn't much to one interested. It is slow and has some long boring parts that tempted me to turn it off and not finish it. About half way through I did turn it off. It was that boring! I was sent this as a review copy for Amazon and I'm glad that I didn't pay to watch it as I would have been disappointed that I wasted money. I thought it would be a film filled with war, but it is anything but that. Yes, there are parts where it has the feel of a war movie, but there is a reason this play is one of Shakespeare's least known or loved. I'd say skip it! Not even Fiennes and Butler squaring off is enough to save this one!"
1,Coriolanus,"CoriolANUS is woeful. Me thinks that the dialogue doth not match the period. Nay, indeed, when you expect that a chariot shall be forthcoming...comes a black Mercedes limo! Moreover, the dialect is British and Fiennes is made to look German, whereas this is supposed to be Roman. Thrice I tried to get through it, but could not suffer to endure. No credit can be given the cast as their roles were undermined. Ralph Fiennes is a great actor otherwise and Gerard Butler forever shines in his role in 300. I get it...the money made them do it! Well, I missed the ending. Perhaps it ended in a pizzeria or, better still, a trattoria (at least I could have laughed.)"
1,Unless your from Ancient Greece don't bother,Horrible.... Couldn't understand a word they were saying. Bad bad bad..... Did I say how bad it was?? Cuz it's very bad!
5,Deep and Horrifying,The whole cast are wonderful. Vanessa Redgrave is as great as always. Fiennes proves to be a great director as well as actor.
3,Its Okay,"I really could not get through this movie fast enough. I was bored with it from the beginning, which was disappointing since Ralph Fiennes is one of my favorite actors."
4,Rent it,"They do speak in shakespearian dialogue. So if thats not your thing, move on. That being said, if you're a true Shakespeare fan, move along, I heard they cut a lot of lines from the original play. If you like the idea of Shakespeare in a modern setting (without teenage leonardo dicaprio) this is a good movie. I thought they got the message across. I bought it and will watch it again."
2,Shakespeare doesn't translate well,"I didn't care for this adaptation. I thought I was watching one thing and got so lost in the dialogue it was as if it were a foreign language to me. I should have read a summary of the plot before selecting this one. I did however select it based on the actors, which I'm sure did great but this just wasn't my taste."
1,Terrible!!!,"Terrible!!! The dialogue is stilted and forced, and most of their actions don't fit the contemporary setting. I would never watch this!"
3,Not for everyone,"Some sort of Modern/futuristic take off of a Shakespear type tragedy. The words are in Old English so its kinda hard to follow. I enjoyed, though my woman got up and went to sleep. But its got a little war in it and I followed it to the end."
4,not bad,"would have enjoyed it more if the dialogue was more present day - this movie has intense Shakspearean dialogue, sometimes difficult to follow line by line."
3,Needs Subtitles,Movie had a lot of potential but unfortunately I didn't understand half of what they were saying since it was completely Shakespearean to a fault. If it had subtitles I would have been able to enjoy it like I do asian cinema...Ralph Fiennes acting however was quite incredible...the emotions at least you can understand.
2,The Trailer is Misleading to the Lines and Dialect,When i watched the trailer i expected something based on Shakespeare's work but updated to incorporate modern aspects. I think someone needs to point out that while the graphics and general portrayal of the movie are fine the actors speak the lines from the original play. This caused me to dislike the film because it was a modern day setting with people spouting thousand year old english dialect and lines. I could not even finish the film because of this.
1,Disappointing,To describe this movie I chose the word DISAPPOINTINGdisappointing/&#716;dis&#601;&#712;pointiNG/AdjectiveFailing to fulfill someone's hopes or expectations.To describe this movie I chose the word DISAPPOINTINGdisappointing/&#716;dis&#601;&#712;pointiNG/AdjectiveFailing to fulfill someone's hopes or expectations.To describe this movie I chose the word DISAPPOINTINGdisappointing/&#716;dis&#601;&#712;pointiNG/AdjectiveFailing to fulfill someone's hopes or expectations.To describe this movie I chose the word DISAPPOINTINGdisappointing/&#716;dis&#601;&#712;pointiNG/AdjectiveFailing to fulfill someone's hopes or expectations.
2,It won't be for everyone,"This won't be the sort of movie that will be enjoyed by everyone, and to be honest, it wasn't enjoyed by me. I appreciate that they were trying to do something different... an edgy Shakespeare set in modern times. However, it just didn't resonate with me. The language felt awkward and inappropriate, especially from Gerard Butler (and his thick Scottish accent). It isn't that I have an aversion to Shakespeare. Certainly not! In fact, I really enjoyed the movie Titus with Anthony Hopkins. But I suppose I prefer my Shakespeare language in a period film, with frilly collar costumes, when it doesn't feel a bit strange and laughable.In fact, I was watching the movie with my sister, and she DID laugh. She said the movie, ""missed the mark"" and I couldn't agree with her more.However, I give them 2 stars for attempting something I hadn't seen before. You have to commend that sort of bravery."
2,Boo,This movie was hard to view. Story was good but Shakespearean dialogue was annoying. Boo! .... .... .... ..... ..
2,"Sorry, didn't appeal to me","I think highly of both main actors in this movie which drew me to try it. However, I just couldn't get into it and left it unfinished. Cumbersome."
4,Cool update,"I'm not one to usually enjoy ""modernized"" Shakespeare, but I thought this one worked. Although I wasn't familiar with this play, the language was pretty easy to follow, once you got over the accents. As much as I love Gerard Butler, his Scottish accent was a little distracting as this was supposed to be taking place in and around Rome. Having minor characters appear on as if on television talk shows was a bit gimmicky, but I liked it. Vanessa Redgrave was phenomenal."
4,Must like old english,Great movie. Language is old style but something makes it all the greater for it. It is not an action film.
3,Like watching the 433rd season of Spartacus,"Since I wasn't a fan of the Romeo & Juliet rehash with Leonardo DiCaprio it should come as no surprise this movie wasn't my favorite. Far too often the language used and the delivery, not to mention Butler's thick accent and saliva surplus, left me and fellow viewers with furrowed brows and confused, ""What was that?""-looks. It just seems stupid to speak of drawing swords when shooting AR-15s, RPGs, and having one-on-one battles shortended by mortar explosions (which obviously wasn't in Shakespeare's original). The anachronism is just not enjoyable. If changes are necessary, then make them wholesale.On the positive side, Ralph Fiennes absolutely explodes as war hero turned Senate hopeful Coriolanus. His delivery is somewhere between a rabid Benedict Arnold and a hyperactive Colonel Kurtz. I enjoyed his performance, even the parts I couldn't understand that well.Those who loved R&J; redux, you will probably like this. Otherwise, I'd advise you to pass."
2,"""Old English""","Dialogue in ""old English"" just couldn't get into the movie even though it had good acting & action. Had to give up & stop it about 25 mins into it as my husband & I couldn't take it any longer! My recommendation is to pass on this one!"
2,Questionable premise,"The acting was fairly decent, however trying to translate and bring Shakespeare to a modern setting just didn't bode well. Nice concept however not for those who aren't well versed in Shakespeare."
2,Coriolanus,I did not like this one at all. It was to gruesome I guess for me to follow along with it.
3,Cariolanus: 3 Starts = DVD Issue,"***COULD NOT PLAY THE DVD! SO, NO RATING. MY DVD PLAYER DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE DVD'S COUNTRY CODE. NO WHERE ON THE DVV OR ITS JACKET DOES IT INDICATE ANY POSSIBLE COUNTRY CODE INCOMPATIBILITY. HELP!"
1,Seriously?,Don't buy it unless your a history or theater nut. Twas a bit stupid in my honest opinion. Was pretty much just blah the whole way through.
4,Excellent,I am not familiar with the original work. But on its own merit I'll say a very good story delving into political intrigue and dangers of not recognizing power. Oh and disturbingly bad mother son relationships. Fiennes and Redgrave are great. Butler not so much but not distracting. Really loved it. I will have to by the play to read now.
1,Shakespearean language NOT understandable,"Great actors, great camera work, but unless you are fluent in old English, you will find it tough to understand what is being said.I am a great Shakespeare fan. In school we studied the great plays, and with help from the teacher we laboriously translated the Shakespearean language into modern day. But as dialog in a fast moving movie, I just couldn't keep up.Why would anyone make a film with dialog like this? Why didn't the first words of the Amazon editorial review mention that the dialog was nearly unintelligible? After Amazon asked my opinion on this movie, I went back and scoured the reviews of people who scored it a ""1"". After reading a number of these, I saw that I could have understood the difficult dialog from reading these reviews. But I feel every review should start with mention of the dialog issue.I turned it off after 10 minutes. What a disappointment."
3,SO-SO,Just okay .didnt blow me away. But the acting was top shelf . Feinnes did an awesome job. Just could've been better.
2,Not What I Expected...,"I can't tell you if Coriolanus is any good, because I didn't get past the first 10 minutes of it. I expected a period drama from the age of the Roman Empire. Instead, I got a modern reenactment of a tale from the Roman Empire. It may be good. I like Ralph Fiennes. I'm just not a fan of reimagining history. If I had know what I was getting, I wouldn't have rented it, and you wouldn't be reading this..."
1,Disappointing,"I am surely a Shakespeare fan but want to consciously decide to watch a Shakespearean production. Here, I thought I was watching a drama-filled action movie...hardly. Gets a 1 for hiding the reality of the director's direction."
1,coriolanus,"Absolutely the worst movie i ever ""tried"" to watch. Surely not what i expected after watching the trailer. Not much else to say."
1,Trailer is misleading,"The trailer is misleading, and I think intentionally so. I would not have rented this at this time if I had known it was the original Shakespeare. At another time, I may have been fine with this movie being the actual Shakespeare lines. Since they disguised what this movie was by keeping to short sentences in the trailer (which I re-watched to be sure I had not just missed the nature of the dialog) in the end, I feel cheated."
1,Worst movie I have seen in a long time.,I ordered this movie because I love Butler - but after watching it for just a few minutes I knew I was not going to like the movie.I did not know it was written in this odd Shakespeare type of language - worst then they could have done.I want my money back!
2,no good,"not my style and or poor story line, I would not push it on anyone to rent and or spend money"
2,Coriolanus,This was not my kind of movie at all. I love Gerard Butler as a rule but didn't like him in this modern day Shakesperian type of movie. Shakespear wasn't my favorite in school anyway and I don't think I realized when I rented this movie that this was going to be the language of this kind. Unless someone likes to hear a modern day Shakespear movie then don't rent it.
3,CORIOLANUS - the movie,"Adapted from Shakespeare's masterpiece with a few changes and, sadly, cuts. However, both Fiennes and Redgrave are superb. The bloody battle scenes graphically visualize Shakespeare's descriptions, but are not for those who faint at the sight of blood. Hopefully, this movie may impel people who don't know Shakespeare's play to see it performed on a stage."
1,oh dear,"""Coriolanus"" set in a contemporary world with extreme violence? Barf.I truly admire both Ralph Fiennes and Gerard Butler, but found this movie unwatchable. I won't even honor it by describing the plot; what's important is that it's virtually impossible to follow in this version. If you really love ""Coriolanus"", read the original or go see the play. It can't be more boring than this."
3,Shakespearean Play in Modern War Garb Doesn't Work!,"Evan with Fines at the helm as director and main actor, presenting Shakespeare's Coriolanus in the garb of modern war doesn't work! I just couldn't get past hearing Shakespeare's lines shouted out in a current war setting. Ralf Fines is compelling; Shakespeare is commanding, but the film comes off more as an experiment in making Shakespeare's Coriolanus relevant than a meaningful film about war!"
5,The Bard would be proud,"I'm all for anything that continues to keep Shakespeare's brilliance alive in the world. Others are sometimes put off by attempts to place the Bard's work in more modern settings, but when you get down to the heart of it, Shakespeare is Shakespeare; the powerful lines and insight into humanity always come to the fore when directors stay true to the text. Fiennes does this in Coriolanus, and he also offers a downright intimidating performance as Martius.For those who were not lit majors: Please don't be put off by the Elizabethan English of Shakespeare. Just watch the first fifteen minutes of this film, and I promise you will be drawn in by the gut-wrenching tension which is held taut throughout the film."
3,An Ok read,I was told this author writes in a style similar to Lisa Jackson. No so. It was a descent read but not up to the quality of Lisa.
3,Make Them Cry,"This was a good book, very easy to read, and kept me guessing until the end. I will purchase more by this author in the future."
2,Not So Vicious,"After reading Mr. O'Brien's Vicious, this was a complete let down. Disappointed that I actually paid for it. It is slow paced and a lot of things are drawn out till you're bored to tears. It barely focuses on the killer so you can't even guess who it might be. I recommend Vicious and Final Breath but no Make Them Cry. Truly truly disappointed."
3,Not very interesting.,The plot is very forced and unrealistic. I can hardly finish this book. A waste of time.
3,Jerky Boys are Better,"This CD was OK at best. Many of the recordings just aren't funny, although the long distance (Phone) track is great.Jerky Boys were better."
2,NOT WHAT I HEARD ON HOWARD STERN!,"ALTHOUGH THIS CD HAS SOME GOOD MOMENTS ---IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY OF THE TRACKS I HEARD ON THE STERN RADIO PROGRAM...THUS I FEEL RIPPED OFF--ON THE STERN SHOW THE CLIPS I HEARD MADE MY SIDE HURT, BUT THIS CD WAS JUST O.K.....I REALLY WISH I COULD GET A REFUND AS I FEEL RIPPED HERE.."
5,Possibly The Funniest Comedy CD Ever!,I have had this CD in my car for 3 straight weeks.I can't stop listening and laughing to it.I change my mind almost everyday as to which track is the funniest.This is Classic Stuff!I can't wait to try out some of his material when someone calls to sell me something.I hope he is working on a second CD.
2,Good for a few minutes of entertainment.,"This CD wasn't nearly as entertaining an I thought it would be. It was good for one listen, and then I'm bored with it. The different segments all sounded the same. It had 2 or 3 really good 'belly laughs'.Good idea, poor execution.The only thing this CD does is prove how far telemarketers will go to sell a product."
4,The Full Story,"Thick book plenty to read,but no coloured photos a few b & w pics.Tells about the making of the show and death of Pete Duel very interesting readingwhorth the money."
5,Great job,"This is a terrific tribute to a great series. The authors did a wonderful job. Not only is it an obvious labor of love, it's an excellently written and edited labor of love. Bear Manor publications tend to be a mixed bag. Often, good intentions are let down by poor execution. This is one book they should be proud to have published. I can't recommend this book highly enough."
3,Older Freestyle Type of Music.,The songs are not the typical newer type of freestyle music. They are some of the first generation of freestyle music. Not a cd I would recommend to anyone nowadays unless they prefer the much older freestyle songs.
5,Good book for novice,I found this a good book for a lawyer that does not have much courtroom experience to help understand some of the finer points of trial procedure.
2,"udo kier:yes, in this one: no","some people might actually enjoy this movie. i didnt. it actually started pretty interesting but got weaker soon. the effects are B movie and the lead actor""s performance is not the strongest, and during the end the movie just gets weird. i would only recommend watching this if you are bored or have too much money to spend :-)"
5,Great little book to help seasoned writers cut out the fat,"Back in the 80s, John Brogan offered a seminar based on this book. I sent several of my already seasoned technical writers to this course, and I was pleased to see how their writing tightened as a result. I'm sorry to say that his seminars are no longer offered, but I was delighted to discover that I could still buy the book. In fact, as I look to hire new technical writers, I intend to use some of the exercises in this book as part of a screening test."
5,A Fiends Dream,"This is a must have for any hardcore Misfits/Samhain/Danzig fan! Mario Montichello's voice is as close as it gets to Danzig, and the musicianship is high quality. Unfortunately these guys broke up, but atleast they left us fiends with this one gem."
4,brilliant horror punk,this is a great disc. i highly recommend checking it out.i find it hilarious that all these bands were inspired by the misfits but have now far surpassed them.
4,The soft side of hard business deals,"During the 1990s, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) hit a historic high. Yet academic research confirms what anecdotal evidence suggested: most mergers do not work. Authors Dennis C. Carey and Dayton Ogden (writing with Judith A. Roland) contend that most mergers fail because of mismanagement and neglect of the merged company's ""soft side"" - the cultural and human dimension. They draw on their experiences as human resource consultants to outline a strategy for assessing people, creating vision, integrating mergers and addressing the soft side's hard problems. We find that the book's greatest strength is its interviews with executives and other insiders who have direct experience with high-profile mergers, both successes and failures. If you are an executive or human resources manager in a company on either side of a merger - or if you think you'll find yourself in that position in the future - read this book before you sign that deal."
5,A Must Have....,"This album is really good I was a little consience about listing to the tracks but it sounds good the lyrics have really meaningful words...the mix of Spanish and English is great! The Spanish tracks are good as well...The last track is ""For All Time"" in Spanish. This album is really good. It's a must have! Hopfully this album sells this summer. Hopfully you'll like it too!"
3,"Soluna's #1 Fan, Nick",I think that Soluna is a really great band and should make a Music vidio on MTV so everyone will know about Soluna and they will become as famouse as N'sync and even loved more than them so that they can be a band for a while.
3,Great Debut! 3 1/2 Stars,"With sultry voices that are sweet to the ear, new girl group Soluna have made a great album that will appeal to lots of listeners, especially fans of mainstream pop and r&b. A mixed bag of songs fill this cd from the great, yet cliched girl power anthems such as Bring It To Me and Hey Hey, You You to the charming and tenderly sweet ballads such as For All Time and I'll Be Waiting For You. A couple songs deserve to be skipped such as the poor remake of All Out Of Love which loses most of the passion behind the original, but some songs you'll surely wanna keep on repeat such as Nothing Looks Good On Me But You and the very saucy Spanish Lullaby which is very reminiscent of Madonna's La Isla Bonita. All in all the album sounds like just what you'd expect from a girl group with a latin flare, but for fans of such musicians as Eden's Crush and Destiny's Child you won't mind at all. A great debut!"
3,Searching for Mom,"McCann has probably already written better books. In this one, which reads throughout like thinly disguised autobiography, he retraces places of his parents' marriage. The story is told mostly in flashback as he visits his dying father in the ramshackle Irish hometown and broken down house where he grew up. Mom (Mam) has long since and wisely fled for parts unknown and based on the description of the old man here it's hard to tell what she saw in him. Intoxicated by his craft and his mastery of words, McCann rarely lets the story tell itself. Once he learns to rein in his tendency to pose on the page, I suspect he'll be fine. Check out his later work to find out, but you can miss Songdogs."
5,Cannot go wrong,One of the only novels I've actually reread immediately because I didn't want it to end. Would make an amazing film.
1,not satisfase,"i expect like regular size of ring,but this one look like a ring for toy or something funy, the MM of our rings is 5MM and this ring may be is 1MMso ridiculousMartin1/5 ct.tw Round Diamond Solitaire Ring in 18k White Gold"
4,A useful lens!,"I bought this lens to go with a FujiFilm S602, and now I wouldn't be without it. The lens comes with an adapter ring, which you require to mount the lens to the camera, and a case to put them both lens and adapter ring together in your gadget bag. My only regret is that, once mounted, the lens can only be used with the maximum wide angle; it takes time to put it on and remove the lens, so this means I have to plan action shots ahead. If you do zoom in with the wide angle lens mounted, you get the effect of a circular mask to your shot.Users be aware you can't really use it with the built-in flash as the lens partially eclipses the flash at the bottom of the shot - to get round this, invest in a hot shoe mountable flash gun and make your camera even more versatile. You will probably want a gadget bag to put your lens in, so adding a flash gun to the kit won't matter much."
1,A nightmare trying to purchase the WL-FX9 through Amazon/Ace Digital!,"Placed and order for this item and never received confirmation that item was to be shipped. Before that though I learned that the item was not even in stock (though Amazon reported that there were 4 item in stock). After almost two weeks of phone calls to Ace Digital, they finally told me that the item was not available and would not be from the manufacturer until Jun 30. Only two problems with that. #1, I have a wedding to shoot in July where I really need this lens and that's just cutting it too close, and #2 the lens is dicontinued so I have NO reason to believe that it will even be able from the manufacturerat even that time; seeing as how they directed me to the ""web"" because they told me personally that they have no more in stock at Fuji Film.Needless to say I cancelled my order. This Amazon thing is definitely a crapshoot."
2,Worked....for one month,"Purchased on 24 August 2012 and it burned out on 28 September 2012. Maybe it was a fluke, but it's still disappointing. The original bulb lasted several years before finally burning out."
5,Worked perfectly in Hitachi 18v light,I had a hard time finding a replacement bulb for my hitachi 18v cordless flashlight. This bulb fits in the light and works perfectly.I would buy this product again.
2,Disappointed,"OK, I'm down with funk, and I've been down with the resergence in fusion/bugaloo/funk/jazz like MMW, Greyboy, Galactic. But I'm sorry, the turkish instruments just do not work here. Try imagining James Brown with an Irish jig band playing along. Get my point? They just don't mix. Don't get me wrong, I'm down with BFE. But did they have to throw the turks into every jam? The mix was just too caustic."
3,Darmush-var,"Love the cover art--great pic of a dolmush, the old communal taxis that take their name from dolma, which is a stuffed grape leaf. Love the Turkish instruments and the funky blend of cultures. Not my favorite BFE cd, but then I love all BFE cds, they make a great accompaniment to a ride across the Chihuahua desert under a full moon, dreaming of oh-so-sweet chai on a faded kilim spread by the banks of the Aegean, or swimming in the phosporescent pools of Pammuk Kale. Bring on da funk; brink on the Turkish charms."
4,Fantastic...Intelligent...,"It's a great album, dynamic an itelligent. Group has made a good blend like Marlboro with Turkish tobacco. But still, I think some tracks are a little bit overdriven with Turkish music. It's a tasteful album which get the same pleasure each time I listen."
5,this cd is incredible. i love it,"the whole cd grows on you ,i never get sick of it i wish this kind of music was on the radio more"

2,56 pages of photographers work,We are planning to visit Arizona. I remembered seeing copies of Arizona Highways describing the state. I ordered the magazine 9/15/12. The first copy arrived 11/19/12. The December issue has 56 pages. Everyone a professional photograph of southwest images. No information about Arizona life or places. Zero usefullness. Maybe future issues will be about Arizona.
5,The best magazine for Arizona,Very easy process in renewing my subscription - cost was very attractive and the magazine quality is superb. Will do it again.
5,Arizona Magazine,I always look forward to each month to look at the beautiful pictures in the magazine! Then I take my time to read through each articles! Arizona is one of my favorite places to go for vacation!
4,a music fan,"Aqui no Brasil o freestyle chegou no final dos anos 80 com o stevie B e suas deliciosas baladas danantes, apesas de na época eu ainda era criana, lembro muito bem das musicas e sinto saudades daquela época que essas músicas tocavam no rádio."
4,a very good high energy cd,Lil Suzy has tremendous talent and continues to grow with this cd. It is fantastic and adds to her collection with great honor. I love high energy and Lil Suzy.
2,Not the soundtracks,"Goldsmith is great, of course, but be warned: this is not a collection of his soundtracks, as advertised. It's an ""interpretation"" (according to the liner notes) by a Czeckoslovakian orchestra. Not a bad orchestra, all in all-- but just know this CD is not what it appears."
2,Terrible Performances,"The orchestra is strident, the surround sound flawed and distorted, and the performances force and lacking in cultural understanding of the music.Changes have been made in the orchestration (where did they get some of these?). Further, the quality of the musicians, particularly the brass, is so compromised as to do Goldsmith's superior music an injustice."
3,Fair but basic coverage of the topic,"For the person unfamiliar with agriculture, this book has some value. It covers the field (pun intended) from about the 50,000 foot level. For additional information, the reader will have to get specific books on what was covered in a paragraph or two in this book."
2,A dreamers book with few details,"The book started off getting me real excited about sustainable farming. I was eager to turn the page and learn more, but as i turned the page, nothing materialized. I learned a lot about soil health and management, but when it got around to details about specific vegetables, growing seasons, and pest prevention, the book was lacking."
4,Nice book,"My son is interested in one day starting a small farm and this contained a lot of general, good information."
4,My dad (in India) likes it!,"Bought this for my dad (in India) who decided to make a career switch from a metallurgist to an agriculturist/farming. He liked this book, however hasn't yet gone through it much, so can't give you a complete picture on how helpful the book was to him."
3,"So, you think you wanna be a farmer?","Written in the late '70s, this book will scare you off the idealistic vision of farming and tune you into some of the economic and other realities. It's dry. It's nuts-and-bolts. It's not groovy. It's about dirt and tractors and seed.The book attempts to give you a complete how-to, but instead you walk away realizing there is a lot to learn."
3,Saitek Cyborg Evo PS27,"First joystick I have owned. Using mainly for X-Plane, find it's response to be less fluid and precise than I would have expected for hardware in this price category."
5,X52 Saitek,I really like the Cyborg but just didn't have enough controls for me so replaced it with X52. I like the check up sounds for each button on the Cyborg to test them. And the X52 doesn't have that.Thanks
1,Very poor at fine control..........,"Yes, It's adjustableYes it has pretty blue lights.But that's it on the ""pro"" list.This stick has one very very major drawback if you are using it as a ""Flight-stick"":The deadband around the neutral point is HUGE.So, starting with no pressure on the stick - you make a fine correction by pushing / pulling and......nothing happens.So you push / pull a little more and......nothing happens.By now you've moved the stick-top a full 1cm, and THEN you get a reaction, or rather an over-reaction. By now it's too late.........I've tackled Saitek at length about this issue, but they insist that it's normal. There are other issues like the wandering rudder, which can be cured in the short-term by editing the registry, but this excessive deadband has no fix.If you fly flight/combat simulators I suggest you avoid this stick at all costs."
4,"Strong graphics, good gameplay, so-so value","This is one of those games that's hard to classify. On one hand, it's a pretty good racing game that's easy for kids to master and enjoy the heck out of. On the other hand, it seems to be built in a hurry. The worlds are vaguely imcomplete, the racing controls tend to lag a little (even on the super-fast XBox platform) and the characters lack, uh, character. When a game is based on a movie, you anticipate a lot of the style and substance of that movie to be reborn in the form of the game itself. In the case of Antz Extreme Racing, the characters are clearly an afterthought. You could plug in any fictional cartoon character in place of the Flik, et al, and still have the same experience. In that regard, the game is a disappointment. On the whole, though, the graphics are first-rate (this is an XBox game, after all) and the gameplay will keep kids entertained. It's a good fit for the 5-9 age group."
4,I Love The Isaacs,I have always loved the Isaacs and I think 'Stand Still' is one of their best CD's yet.(And I've been listening ot them for a long time.)
4,great music,"A fine album by a family act that are total pros, and nicely recorded.The Issacs mean what they sing about, and they sing gospel.But it is fine music whether you are regular church goer,or just a music fan liking nice clean and enjoyable musicin the gospel style."
3,OK project,"This CD is a really good mix of blugrass and southern gospel. This CD would be better if the original family: Becky, Sonya, Lily, and Ben did more lead on the songs. They let the new members do too much. But I still love them. Keep a-goin guys!!!"
3,Used prices?,"The prices listed here for used copies are frankly unacceptable, given how readily available this edition remains in the UK .... The book is lovely otherwise, worth the looking further afield."
4,Better than Nothing (Left to Lose),"I bought this single before the Nothing Left to Lose cameout. .... I am both a Pink Floyd fan and skeptical of covers, but FF's rendition of Have A Cicar is a perfect punked-up version to the original. FF has picked up on many of the details that make the song what it is and have utilized them in a harder version, particularly the heavy guitar intro and the agonizing yells that trail off from the chorus. --Frankly, I think Nothing Left To Lose is boring and does not measure up to their previous 2 albums. I recommend buying this single instead. ...."
1,Pink Floyd can't be remixed by Foo Fighters,"If you're buying this CD for the song ""Have A Cigar"", go and buy Pink Floyd's ""Wish You Were Here"" instead. This is a such a great song, but the Foo Fighters just ruined it. It is not meant to be a hard rock song and should never be. Do not buy this album."
3,"We've been here before, haven't we???","...a great package of some of the better public domain exploitation/grindhouse/drive-in films, which include the following titles:Beast of Yucca Flats (1961)Die Sister, Die (1974)Drive-In Massacre (1974)Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter (1965)Rattlers (1976)Scream Bloody Murder (1972)She Demons (1958)Track of the Moonbeast (1976)...and now the bad news!!! For those who invested their hard earned money into the same company's multi-movie set, called ""Drive-In Classics"", guess what?? The company merely recycled the same titles into this multi-movie set, and then, revamped the packaging, to resemble something not unlike the advertising for Tarantino's own ""Grindhouse/Death Proof"" production. In the end, here we have a clear-cut case of 'Buyer Beware'....."
4,Powerful,"Great book, really helpful as I study to increase my ability to create a happy, purposeful and full life!..fast service, book in great condition..Thanks"
4,"Excellent principles, a bit outdated.","I worked at the MTC for 3 years, ending August 2011. Many of the principles of the book still apply. Others are a little outdated given the changes that have occurred in missionary work in recent (and maybe not-so-recent years). The fundamental doctrine of faith is obviously still relevant. But don't buy this for a missionary. They can't read it anyways. (Missionary Library only)"
1,An alternate view,"The ideas in this book caused at least one individual great pain. It's part of that ""prosperity gospel"" garbage that is not supported by what Jesus said as quoted in the Bible.[...]"
4,stand,It's very sturdy and holds the books very well. I also bought it as a gift andthe person also likes it
5,Excellent,"Excellent product, Simple yet elegant. Holds the heaviest books. arrived very quickly and was the best price I could find on the internet. Very satisfied and hope to deal with again. Thanks"
4,"5 stars for hardbacks, 3 stars for trade paperbacks","I've used one of these for decades, all the way back to my university days, and it's definitely an old and dear friend. So much so that I recently bought a new one when the little rubber tips finally wore out on the old one.This book holder works really well for any kind of hardback, even a big dictionary. However, in my experience it doesn't work very well for trade paperbacks. They flop forward and don't hold at all well. If you want a really wonderful book holder for that purpose, I recently discovered theBookbax(which is also good for holding the Kindle and Kindle Fire and other tablet readers)."
4,Convenient and sturdy,"This product looks very flimsy when you get it, but it has lasted me a very long time and has done a great job. I am a law student and it has lasted me through two semesters of constitutional law, which is most likely the thickest book ever printed. So don't be fooled by how small it looks. It works great for the price."
4,wire study stand,"service by the seller was goodthe stand is fine & doesn't slip, holds books as long as they are not above average for height or thickness.If they are you need to brace it so it can't slide back and I use large binder clips to help hold pages openIt would be a better product if it was made to accomodate larger books"
2,Doesn't really fit larger books,Negative: It was not good for my purposes - Law Student and it didn't hold pretty much all of my books. I recognize Law Books are large but based on the photo which appears to be a dictionary I thought it would easily hold my books and it did not.Positive: Folds Flat and easily fit in my back pack and seems pretty sturdy.
3,"Good for small hardcover books, not meant for textbooks","This cover is only good for small books with hardcovers. If the books is paperback, it is pretty difficult to read with this stand, and it will make you very frustrated. Same goes for thick textbooks (ex. college textbooks). Big books tend to make this stand collapse over, and you will be very frustrated using this for textbooks.Overall:Pros: works well with small/medium hardcover books.Cons: the design of the stand is not meant for big textbooks, and small paperback books."
1,Horrible,"Not even small hard backs settled in this item well, it's also easy to damage the book because of the corkscrews on both the holders; the holders should be smooth, not bumpy which is what the corkscrews make them. I initiated a refund, that's how junky this item is."
2,design needs improvement,"the design of the Fellowes Wire Study Stand is almost elegantly simple, with one stationary upright piece that supports the spine of the book, and the horizontal leverage provided by 2 1-piece book hooks / stand supports that pivot around the 2 legs of the spine support (each leg forming a cross when pivoted out), so the whole thing folds flat when not in use. However, it needs the simple addition of a way to lock the pivot, so the legs don't move when you shift the book. Also the base is not wide enough, so if you are just starting or finishing a book and the bulk of the pages are on one side, the stand is wobbly. I wasn't sure this would work for me so I also bought a Fellows Booklift Copyholder at the same time. Even though the Booklift Copyholder product is flimsy plastic, and I won't be surprised if it breaks under my textbooks, I like the design better and will use it until it does break. Then maybe I will pull out this wire one."
2,not very good for school. hard to turn pages,I didn't buy this. My ex got it for me. It looks like it's a quality build and appears well designed.But it's not very useful for school. It can't hold books very well. especially text books. it's very hard to turn pages when the book is in the stand. i had to constantly take the book out of the stand to turn the page. very irritating after awhile.maybe it's useful for cookbooks and for holding sheet music.I got the Easi Reader which costs a lot after shipping but that works far better. I can hold all sizes of books and can still turn the page when the book is in the stand.
1,You get what you pay for ... pretty lame,"This is a pretty inconvenient book holder, which sucks because it is a product that is supposed to be extra convenient. 1) It's not easy to turn pages, which is really annoying. 2) If you want to just put pieces of paper in it (not a solid book), the paper just flops over.This is going in the trash."
5,wire study stand.,"This little device is very functional. I have used it to hold cookbooks, individual recipe cards, as a copy stand with my computer, and to hold instruction books when I am assembling different products. Light-weight and functional - excellent."
4,Works pretty well...,"This product works well. On one side, it can hold around 320 pages max of a hardcover book. If it held more pages, then for smaller sized books less than 200 pages, there would be too much space and the pages would swing forward. On a softcover book, the pages will curve inward along where the two sides of the book meet, so you need to break the spine in a little to make it open a little wider."
4,wire stand design,The wire stand was well designed to hold books from 4in-12in wide. Sits the book open as wide as you want.
4,"Alright, with a quick modification","I'm studying for an exam with softcover textbooks. The widest is approximately 1.75"" thick. Because this product does not have a backstop, it is obviously better suited to hardcover books. However, I put a rigid folder behind my book and my softcover books are supported fine.If you have softcover books thicker than 2.5"", I would look elsewhere."
5,freaking love this thing,"yes it gets a little unbalanced when u put huge books on it, or have the book open to the last chapter. still an awesome buy and a great price. if youre actually going to be reading huge dictionaries, u prob want a different product. i have a 400 page paperback that does well on it. imagine a 400 page hardcore would do well also. the idea is that youre probably not turning the page too often if youre using this, so its very livable. definitely recommended."
2,Not for large books!,"I purchased this product in the expectation that it was rather large (per the picture showing a big book resting on it). Unfortunately it only holds books at a depth of 1.5 inches, which is useless for the programming books, and other textbooks I own. Also the stand doesn't have a lock, it is instead combined with the page holders on the front to create a rather cumbersome mechanism. The lack of any real helpful adjustments also made this purchase a regretful one. If you are going to use books of any real thickness, look elsewhere as I know I just wasted $10."
1,Won't stay standing,"It doesn't do what it is supposed to do. It will not hold my big law school books, and therefore is useless to me."
3,Not good for large textbooks,I bought this stand to use for propping up large textbooks while I took notes. It's really too flimsy to deal with large books. The arms in the front of the stand do prevent the pages from slipping... but they also prevent the pages from turning easily when you need to browse.
3,Study Stand,Stand was as described. However unable to use it for intended purpose because it would not handle the book thickness desired. Each side of the book holder accomidates 1 3/4 of an inch. Lots of technical manuals are thicker than this.
4,iPad stand,"great for iPad stand and I can use it to hold books when reading -- all in all, a great value."
4,Good,"It's pragmatic. It's okay for standing it on a desk and reading from there, although turning the pages is a labor. It's been good for me because my neck gives me issues if i look down too much when i read, so that's probably the main benefit. Other than that, it's probably just stylistic (if you call it stylistic)."
4,Very Happy,"I bought this book holder for my wife and she is very happy with it. The shipping charges were twice the price of the item, which I think is outrageous."
4,Not for soft cover books.,"Extremely portable, light, and durable. This is definitely a product worth trying! I think it's better suited for hard cover books though, It's a little flimsy when its holding onto large soft cover books. I am a little bothered that its not SYMMETRICAL, One of the legs is longer than the other, but that doesn't really hinder its functionality. I would recommend this product for hard cover books that aren't thicker than a 1.5""."
3,Functional product with no frills,"Pros:Occupies little space, low price, performs as advertised, portableCons:Difficult to turn pages when book is in place.--------I have been using this product for several weeks. I use it primarily to hold hardcover textbooks that are ~1000 pages.The product performs as advertised, but it difficult to turn pages once the book is in place. In order to turn the page, you have to remove the book from the stand, turn the page, and then place the book back in the stand. With thicker textbooks (~1000 pages), the bottom of the pages frequently are crumpled when inserting the book into the stand.For that reason, I'm going to try eitherJasmine Book Stand (Bookstand / Bookstands / Holder / Cookbook / Music)orINP-103 Book Stand (Bookstand / Bookstands / Holder / Cookbook / Music), which look more suitable for large textbooks."
4,Works fine.,"Box stand was cheap, and it worked as promised. Just try to get the book in the clasps somewhat evenly and you're good to go!"
1,Not that great,"I bought this book stand intening to use it for my law books, but it barely hold them up. I though it would be stronger. If you want to hold up something heavy this book stand is not for you."
2,Not great for large books,"I purchased this item hoping it would fit my large computer programming books. Looking at the pictures, I thought it would work. When it arrived, I knew right then it wouldn't fit even before putting one of my books on it. I wish Amazon would change the picture. It's so misleading. Oh well, I guess I can use this for smaller books. I'll be looking on Amazon again for another book holder. I may try the Jasmine Book Stand."
4,"Fair Product, Fair Price","This little book stand works as it is supposed to. It works best on regular sized textbooks (under 1.5 inches thick), and large books. Extremely large textbooks and regular paperbacks don't really work well with this as it's not very adjustable. It's designed to be spaced a certain distance, otherwise it collapses. It isn't perfect for all books, but it works well for its purpose and price, and folds up so it can easily be stored."
4,Great cheap iPad stand,"I didn't want to go pay $50 for a tiny piece of stylized aluminum to hold my iPad, so I got this instead. It works great, no problems. It's not the lightest thing if you're planning to haul it with you, but it's not that heavy. Totally worth the five bucks."
3,NOT FOR BIG BOOKS,"This is a great tool for reading. But I think that its design is not the best, the study stand does not support large books or heavy ones."
5,Great product,This is a great book stand. I'm a nursing student and we have loads of book work. Thanks
5,really?,are you really reading a review for a 5 dollar wire stand? STOP IT RIGHT NOW and just buy the damned thing. it works.
1,disappointing,i bought this stand to read magazines and was disappointed. it would be good for a hardback book but not a paperback. soft books fall over.
4,"Almost, but not quite","I like the idea that you can lay this copy stand flat and store it when not in use, and that you can even put a book in the brackets and it will hold it open while you type. (they give you around 1 1/2 inches). I also like that it's simple in it's design, all metal with plastic end pieces. The one flaw with this is that they need a piece going up through the center and topping it by about five inches since regular paper just folds over the top of the stand. I did remedy this by putting a metal ruler through it and it works fine. But even so, what was Fellowes thinking when they designed it? Just that one piece and it would be a five star."
4,It works great,"The bookholder is really compact and lightweight, and I like its extreme simplicity. It holds pretty large books well (however, don''t expect the phone guide to fit. It's not going to happen). My only complaint is that mine seems to be slightly out of balance which makes it not all that stable. But overall it is a good product, and I'll buy it again as a gift."
5,great book holder,love this bookholder. simply does the job.it folds so it doesn't take any space when it's not used.
1,Explains everything,"In her own words, Mrs. Carter describes exactly why President Carter was not reelected and is considered one of the worst presidents in history. It also brings to light, why Mrs. Carter herself is not well thought of by not only other First Ladies, but Americans in general. Fascinating."
2,Be Forewarned...,"Be forewarned, there is a mammoth lack of heterosexuality to the stories within. Considering the length of this title, I expected at least some diversity. If you are not looking to read mostly female/female I really couldn't recommend it."
2,Mammoth Book of Women's Fantasies,"I got this book based on a review I read that many of the selections are lesbian themed. I was disappointed to find a lot of foot fetish fantasies. It seemed that most all of the lesbian fantasies were foot fetish fantasies. Most of the selections were not sexy to me at all, but then again I don't really care for straight erotica. I'm not sure when I think about it why I got this book. I would only recommend this book for a straight woman or a straight leaning bisexual woman, especially if she has a foot fetish. For a lesbian without a foot fetish the selections are just plain not hot."
4,Now that's some funny chit.,"Oh yea. You are going to laugh out loud when you read this one. True juvenile hyperbole for the fun loving outdoors person. ""No Sh_t! There I Was"" is the first of the series but each edition is it's own stand along funny bone tickler. Highly recommended for those outdoorsmen who are bored with a novel and already own enough non-fiction publications about the finer points of fly fishing and hiking boot selection. This one is purely for humorous enjoyment.Enjoy.DH"
3,"Simple, but Confusing","I got this book as a gift for graduation. The reipies in it are easy to make, and most of the ingredients are not hard to find, but it's confusing to use since most of the ingredients are measured in ounces.I don't have a scale, and I don't want one. If it's one small chicken breast, I can unerstand, but 3 to 4 oz of chicken is not a very straight forward way to either buy or use in my non-existent kitchen.If you want to learn how to cook using your common sense, this is not the book for you. But, if you have the time, patience and energy to pull out your scale and weigh to the dime, go right ahead and buy it!"
3,Solo Cooking Recipes,I was a bit disappointed in the ingredients needed to cook solo. Many of the items I do not stock in my pantry. The recipes seem elaborate and time consuming. I would not recommend this book for the serious solo cooker at home.
5,Great Manfredini score,This score again reflects the masterful technique and scoring capabilities of Harry Manfredini. It is such a shame that we do not see more of his scores in print. Excellent score!!
3,Ok score...,"Havent seen the movie yet, tough, but i just had to have the soundtrack. Im a Jason fan... ;) Alltough, some good tracks, this soundtrack was nothing to jump in the roof for... My favourite track is no.11, ""KM Kicks Butt"". A good buy, but not as good as it could have been..."
2,craps,"On every computer I install this game on, the game freezes after I place a bet on the craps table and the dice are rolled. It did not do this on an earlier version I had used for years."
2,Craps Is SLOW,"Craps game is unbelievable slow between rolls. About 30 or so seconds between the rolls before the game starts responding again. Ackowledged on Hoyle's website as a bug that cannot be fixed. If you play craps, this is not your software of choice. The 2009 version works but game play isn't realistic for craps. Rest of game is fine and game play is good."
1,No fun craps,"It takes 45 sec.to 55 sec. in between rolls at the craps table. This product takes the exciting game of craps and puts you to sleep. They are aware of this problem and still continue sell it. If you enjoy craps, don't buy this. T/Bone"
3,how can they release it?,"Now this is an official product of the United States Playing Card Company. Then how is it possible that after rolling the dice, you won't be able to roll it till a minute later? This bug is so obvious you wonder how is it possible that the product is released before they fix this bug. Also, half a year has passed since the user reported the problem on amazon and known on the official Encore forum. Now, the bug is still not said to be fixed on the official support page."
2,Crap Table is Crappy!,I enjoy the Poker tables. The Crap table is way to slow. I understand this is a problem with most folks who purchased this game. I was disappointed with the new characters also. They removed the ability to trash talk to the other characters. All in all a real let down! I hear there is a patch that will make it all better...but i am not holding my breath.
4,Pleased with product,I was very pleased on the speed of the delivery of the product. It was in excellent condition to be a used book. Thank you for your wonderful service!
3,Small Book,"Its well written and the illustrations are well done. Its a short read but a good one for little hands. Its a gift, I'm sure it will be enjoyed."
4,good way to get grandparents to explain playing the dozens.,"I read this book to a class of 14 year olds in an effort to get the message across to them that name-calling is an ineffective way of communicating. I asked them what a 5 year old would think of the book and if there were any messages in it for them. I was pleased that they could relate to the theme.I also had my 7 year old grandson read it to me. He gave it a 10!His grandfather, a former ""master dozens player"" enjoyed discussing it with him as well."
5,Exactly as expected,"Standard, medium, latex powder-free gloves. Exactly what you would expect, just like the big brands. The brand was ""Aurelia"" is on the boxes I received, but since that wasn't in the description before purchase, I imagine they might switch brands around. Says on the box ""chlorinated... non-sterile"". I use them for minor medical purposes."
3,A Tad Thin But Fits Like Skin!,"Bought them through you as it seemed a fair price, which it is. And of course, the size 'small' is not always readily available. However, although they fit like skin, I expected them to be 'thicker'. I am not in the medical field; I just use disposables around the house for cleaning, baking, etc. They are a blessing for someone who does not wish her hands to be in soap and water all day."
1,barely usable,"I'm relieved I finally finished the 3 boxes I bought. The first box was fine. The 2nd and 3rd were defective. The latex was sticking together - so I had to very gently tease them apart in order to get my fingers in. Plus, to add insult to injury - box 2 and 3 were a size smaller than marked!I am very determined and was able to use almost all of them, with a lot of patience and trouble.I have now ordered more expensive latex gloves from amazon (I tried 3 different brands this time - for comparison. So far the 1st box is fine.)"
4,Good Gloves.,These are very good quality gloves. I used to work in the medical field and these gloves are the same grade as the ones we had at work. A very good buy!!
1,Very poor quality,The book was dirty/dusty. The back page was torn and I had to tape it. It had moldy spots on the back corner from water/moisture. Should have been rated poor instead of good/acceptable.
5,Zip Gun Bop,"The first album from Royal Crown Revue, pioneers of Neo-Swing and kings of gangster bop. Sound is not that big, but they are fabulous anyway! Here you'll find original Zip Gun Bop and Hey Pachuco!. Daydreamin' is a wonderful vocal ballad. Eddie Nichols sounds fabulous, Stern brothers (Adam-bass, Mark-drums and Jamie-alto sax) with Mando Dorame and James Achor too."
5,Excellent Body Cream,"If you've tried many creams and can't find a light, pleasant scent in a body cream with natural ingredients, no-animal testing, etc., then give Zia's Natural Skincare Ultimate Body Butter, a try. I'm a Senior with dry skin, and Zia really renews my skin, after a shower."
1,Not for Samsung Behold,"The case looks nice and is well-made, especially for the price. But it is TOO BIG for my Samsung Behold T919, and was designed definitely not for the Samsung Behold as advertised. As I saw from its cover, this case was designed for IPhone 3G, HTC Dash, BB9000,... which are significantly bigger than the Behold."
4,Functional but not too pretty,"I tend to have a hard time holding on to my Slvr. It's thin, and smooth and slips through my fingers and out of my pocket all the time. I got this case to help prevent it slipping, and to cushion it when it did happen to take a fall, and I'm glad to say it does exactly that. The rubbery case keeps the phone in my pocket, and I haven't dropped it once. As far as functionality goes it's really a great case.Unfortunately, as far as looks go, it's not that great. The seam that runs all along the edge is jagged as though poorly cut from the material. All other openings (the spot for the phone charger, and for a charm attachment) have excess bits of silicon hanging off as well. It's possible that it's just the particular case that I got that was imperfect, but I wouldn't bet my money on it.Still, it's a cheap case, and it does it's job, so as long as you're all right with your phone looking a little shabby, I'd say it's a good deal."
5,Truly Legendary!,"It spans some of the greatest medical scientists in history, with complementing prose. I was fascinated and left wanting more...as we know their to be so many wonderful scientists in the world, and notably in the world past. My favorites of course, Pasteur, Banting, Laennec, Lister. Unfortunately, Marie Currey wasn't in this book, except in the author's note as well as many others...however, there were plenty of good ones. I recommend this to anyone interested in the history of medicine in a storybook fashion. Awesome!"
3,Dont Eat It,This trick is handy but not as cool as I thought it would be. Cant really hand out unless you make a switch and dont eat the prop. that wouldnt digest too well.
5,Best Trance Album I've ever heard,I've heard plenty of trance albums to date. A State Of Trace 2006 is hands down the best one I have ever heard. Brilliant - gets better with every listen.
5,A Journey Well Worth Taking!! AVB = #1 DJ of '06,"even though this is so cliche... DON'T HESITATE TO BUY...I haven't heard a trance compilation this well compiled since Tiesto's ""In Search of Sunrise 3"". In my opinion AVB is at THE TOP of his game right now and he understands what people are searching for in a double disc album. As 2 disc albums are becoming the norm for trance artists, too many filler tracks are being thrown in to give the appealing concept of ""more bang for your buck""(AVB has done this with the previous ASOT 2005). But WOW has he learned...Each disc has it's own creative theme:Disc 1 - On the Beach (More ambient, chill type of trance)Disc 2 - In the Club (Banging but still classy trance that makes you get hype)I could go into a ridiculous amount of detail but I won't. This will please your ear on the first, second, third, and 1,000th listen. BUY IT while it's still new and experience AVB's recently found ""#1 DJ"" status vibe. Definitely the best mix of the summer!!!"
5,It's About Time!,Finally!!! A trance album that is worth listening to over and over again from the first to the last track. Beautifully arranged and wonderfully mixed. This is a must have for those who liked the trance of the mid 90's. No annoying vocals and you actually get put into a trance without already being in an altered state of mind (though it does help!).
3,Armin continues his trance mix,"I found this disc to be filled with good trance music, but overall I feel this is not Armin's best, yet not his worst either. I much prefer his ""Universal Religion 2004 - Live from Ibiza"" album. Ranks somewhere in the middle for me, so I only gave it 3 stars.JEC"
4,ARMIN WILL BE THE NEXT #1 DJ FOR 2006 !!!!,"Hi guys,The reason that I gave 4 stars for Mr. Armin, is because I felt that it miss it a little bit of the melodic trance that he put for example on the Univesal Religions, but the CD is grrreat, have a lot of punping themes, trancey all the way.I hope that Mr. Armin gets the #1 this year, he is realling rocking the sound.Hildely"
1,Armin Vanburen,Very disappointed with this purchase. The CD was supposed to contain two cds and there was only one.
4,State of Trance 2006 is Good,"AVB does a good job of mixing and matching to produce an up-tempo summary of the State of Trance in 2006. If you're into electronica, dance and trance, this is a must have... and his 2007 version I like even better."
5,I listened to this more than Tiesto's ISOS 5....Buuren is amazing,"Great tracks, great beats, great build ups, great vocal tracks, simply amazing. I was really impressed with him on this album. I've always listened to him with a handful of others...but he really out did himeslf here. Go Buuren! See you in NYC soon!"
5,AMAZING!!,I know Tiesto is number 1 right now...but look out world...Amrin is coming up quick!!! This set is absolutely amazing!!! I loved his 2005 set and this just makes me even more excited....I have to say that Armin is my fave DJ to this day!! I cant wait until he comes to Dallas again!!! N E Wayz this set will have you jammin from the number 1 cd at the beach until the number 2 cd at the club...Helllzzz yeah!!! this set is pumpin!! Control Freak is by far my favorite song on cd2.... I def reccomend this cd to anyone who is s trance lover!!! ENJOY!!!
1,JOYFUL NOISE!,"WELL, ""THE RUBBER BAND MAN,"" AS I CALL HIM, HAS STRUCK AGAIN AND I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS CD. IT IS ABSOLUTELY A GREAT JOY TO LISTEN TO, SO MUCH SO THAT I JUST CAN'T LISTEN TO IT OFTEN ENOUGH. I HAVE HAD SEVERAL DAYS OF NOT BEING ABLE TO LISTEN TO ANYTHING ELSE ALL DAY, AND, JUST WHEN I THINK I AM DONE, IT STARTS AGAIN AND OFF I GO, DANCIN' AND GROOVIN'. I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT!YES, THIS ALBUM GOES VERY WELL WITH THE RECOMMENDED, ""IN SEARCH OF SUNRISE 5,"" (TIESTO) AS WELL ATB'S, ""IN THE MIX 3."" WHAT A GREAT TRIPPLE PURCHASE!I'LL TELL YA, I HAVE FOUND THIS CD SO UPLIFTING AND FUN THAT I HAVE HAD MOMENTS IN WHICH I REALLY FELT GLAD TO BE ALIVE JUST TO HAVE HEARD IT...NO KIDDING. I HOPE THAT IT DOES THE SAME FOR YOU."
1,its to slow off beat no good,"there are better cds for sale this cd was of pitch,lacked amplification,not editted propertly,not loud enough,not enough bpm, sound rotation off, songs not blended correctly, wrong versions played,i mean i could go on forever with an honest description since i take music seriously. you are better off taking his music list which by the way is awesome and hunt for those imports yourself with various versions on them and purchase a cd vinyl recording sampler and burn your own compilation with the correct versions of those songs, its that bad. I dare armin or any music fanatic to do the same and to compare those versions from the same artist with this compilationthen you will understand what im talking about since music is part of my genes you will know the difference.I mean if you have bad taste in music start acquiring a better taste by playing the better versions from the same artist thats all."
2,One of the awful cut versions ofn the FAB TV series,"The new U.S. Army transport vehicle 'The Sidewinder' is tested, it runs into trouble and disappears beneath the ground. The atomic engines are overheating and the underground thermal heat make normal rescue impossible. International Rescue is called, and an ingenious and dangerous operation devised to save the men trapped below. This video is from the collection that made its disastrous appearance on the Fox channel in 1994. It severely cut the original episode, loosing all its charm and excitment. New music and voices did nothing to improve the show. All that is left is an appreciation for the Supermarionation technique and a wistful sigh for all that was gone. END"
3,T.A.C.T.I.C.A.L Review,"The men and women who set out to protect and serve find they must often deceive to solve the case. Following the riveting hunt of a helpless murder witness, the deadly war between the Special Forces and the drug lords rages on. Amidst this ongoing battle, murders are committed, hits are made, and the chances of survival shrink minute by minute.I must say, this is a pretty good action flick! Between the drug lords, battles, murders, and deadly war, let's just say this film is full of suspense. I was impressed with the quality of the film as well. There are some well known actors in the film too. I think it is definitely worth checking out on a rainy day."
4,Very pleased.,Purchased in several colors. The quality and durability of this item is great. Would definitely recommend for self or as a gift.
5,A Stellar Performance,"The finest recording of this suite I know. The Canadians capture the astrologic quality of Holst's score without loosing the essential English feel to the music. If you have only one recording of ""The Planets,"" make it this one."
2,Not as good as Chicago/Levine's...,"While this recording may be a step up from Boult or Bernstein and is probably the most well-known recording of these works, I think it is completely outshined by the recording of Holst's ""Planets"" by the Chicago SO under James Levine, which is available on the Deutsche Grammophone label. Jupiter, Mercury, and Mars are my personal favorites, and the CSO renders vivid portraits of those works.A comment on the Penguin Music Classics series: I own ten PMC CDs, and I think that they have largely made excellent choices as to the recordings selected for packaging in this series. I particularly like the Schubert Symphonies 5 & 9 (Vienna/Kertesz) and the Rachmaninov Piano Concerti 3 & 4 (Ashkenazy/London/Previn)."
5,"Bright, Bold, Etheral... but not all at once","You really can't miss with this recording. Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony rise to the occasion and deliver a ""Planets"" that is bright when it has to be (as in ""Jupiter""), daringly bold (even for ""Mars""), and unearthly etheral (""Neptune""). In many other recordings of this piece, there is usually a weak link, or several. One of the planetary pieces just seems to fall short from the rest. Here you find superb quality all around. I thought I had a really good version with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony, but I like this one even better. The clarity of the recording is remarkable."
1,didn't work in my subaru,"I wish I'd read these reviews before buying this dog. It got a great write-up in the NY Times (talked about how the simple cassete mechanism avoided all the problems associated with FM based ipod to auto adapters). But it just auto-ejects from my car. I'd be wary of using it in any car with auto reverse and auto eject, which is probably most cars."
4,Good enough,"I use mine in the car with a 6gb hard disc player and it has survived very well. Can't say I've ever noticed any mechanism noise, or for that matter any distortion.At the price I reckon its good value and I'd happily buy another one if and when it stops working.The main thing is that it enables me to have a 1000 tracks in the car, and not 100 cassettes."
1,Garbage,"The Belkin Cassette adapter is absolute junk. I put it in my tape player and I had to stick my finger in there and jiggle it around to get stereo--hit a bump and you have to jiggle it again. Then, on a cold morning, it won't play because it gets tight so the cassette player keeps switching sides! This thing is a total waste of money. My last cassette adapter came with my Sirius radio and worked perfectly for over a year until I sold the car."
1,Did not work for my cars,"I purchased the Belkin Cassette Adapter for use on both my cars. Never able to play. It jammed both times but unfortunately I was able to get it out without damaging the tape players. Vehicles tried: 97 Toyota Avalon, 96 Porsche 993."
1,Do not buy. Out of ignorance i've purchased 2 and they both do not work.,I've purchased two of these adapters from Belkin. Both of them broke after a couple weeks of use. My cassette player consistently ejects the adapter after about five minutes of use. I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing.
2,Go for something else.,"I originally purchased this to go along with my Creative Mp3 player. Package arrived, I hooked it up and it worked perfectly. About 3 months later, I began having problems with the sound. I would have to fiddle with the cord and make sure it was at the right angle or it would cut in and out. Eventually, It just went dead.Remember, there are other items like this on the market, and this is by far on the lower part of the spectrum. You get what you pay for. I wouldn't reccomend it."
5,Works great unless you have a cheap tape deck,I've been using this Belkin adapter with a 30GB video iPod for over a year and have had absolutely no complaints. I've used it with a Toyota factory stereo and a Bose stereo. This was the 4th cassette adapter I bought and the Belkin works better than any other I've tried. I suspect the other reviewers have cheap/defective tape decks in their vehicles.
1,Belkin Doesn't Know iPod,"After shelling out $40 for a TuneCast that was very good at consistently delivering quality static through my car stereo, I thought there was no way anyone could muck up a cassette adaptor. I was wrong. This time, I can hear my iPod music, but only through the left speakers. It's great, because I always thought a lot of those old Beatles songs would've been great if Sir George Martin didn't have to go and add all that extra instrumentation on the right side."
1,Waste of money -- Does not work at all!!!,"This product is the worst purchase I have made for my ipod. I thought if I purchased the more ""expensive"" tape/adapter I would have a better chance at it working well in my car. Boy was I wrong. This thing NEVER worked. My cassette player in my car continually spit this out. I ended up going to buying the $9.99 RCA adapter at Kmart which worked perfectly in my car. Don't bother with this worthless thing. Buy the cheaper RCA adapter and you will save yourself $10 and have a product that works."
1,Doesn't work for me,"Recently purchased this unit. Works (kind of) in a 2003 Prius - rattles like crazy when inserted in the factory cassette. Doesn't work at all in my 1999 Honda Odyssey - factory sound. Reverses forward and back, forward and back, then ejects."
1,Tape Adapter is Trash,"I bought the Belkin because it is the ""standard"" brand for Ipod accessories. I should of read the reviews... doesn't work with Bose factory sound in my 2003 Maxima. Insert adapter and it switches from side 1 to side 2 and then ejects. I tried an XM radio tape adapter, and a Sony tape adapter and both worked. So it isn't the factory sound, it's the Belkin cassette adapter. Save yourself 20 bucks and find another brand."
4,"good dvd but showing its age, 1980's.","I ordered this to help train my lab, it is almost solely about using a shock collar. The quality is lacking but the information is good. I would recomend it but only for those who are serious dog trainers and have some experience with a shock collars use already."
3,FreeStyle Music,"CD was used but in great condition as advertised. Although each track is not seperate, two long tracks, A side & B side...."
3,I bought this album to sample the first 40 seconds of side B/ song2,"AND! It was phenomenal for that purpose. But just as one of the other two reviewers have mentioned, this is a typical type of freestyle album. But with the exception of the Intro to the song I like, ""love will keep us together"", there is a Pre Drama execution of sounds."
2,Dorcey 41-2498 1/2 watt led flashlight warning,"Nice flashlight, life long LED bulb but beware of changing batteries the front end has to be removed and four aa batteries installed. When closing the flashlight and attempting to screw down the unfriendly front end I broke the plastic parts that fit on the battery. This is poor design and I would like Dorcey International to replace the parts and change their design. What good is a lifetime bulb, when the whole assembly breaks the first time you replace the batteries. Contact info not available on the flashlight of course to provide feed back to the vendor."
1,Worked 3 times,"What more can I say? I got three uses out of it and now the little LED just glows feebly when i switch it on. Cleaned all contacts, replaced new batteries == no joy. :("
4,beginnings of judo,"This is currently only available on VHS, which is odd, because the 2nd film of this duo is out as a DVD. The quality of the images is not good, but the film is worthwhile, because it is one of the first attempts by a major director, Akira Kurosawa, to show something of the attitude toward martial arts in the Japanese culture. From today's standpoint a little simplistic in terms of action, but the film tells an important story, and represents an attitude that is little recognized in today's high-tech world."
1,Can't review it since it was never received.,"Better to buy it from a place that actually ships it, but I ended up picking mine up at Wal-Mart. Different brand, and different mg strength though."
4,What took so long?,"I've been waiting for this since the Higher Learning soundtrack. I'm only slightly disappointed. This CD has it all almost: A few classics, a couple throw aways, and an obligatory ""I was high when I wrote this song"" song.Yes ladies and gentlemen, every neo-soul album must have a weed song. Jill had one. Musiq had one. D'angelo had one. Bilal had one or two. Angie had one. If the new generation of soul have learned nothing else from the pioneers, they've learned that weed is fun to sing about.Why artists with so much talent would have to waste 3 valuable minutes singing about dime bags is perplexing. I'm like this: If you don't have anything interesting to say, then make an instrumental. I'd rather hear a Raphael guitar solo any day.Don't follow trends. That's what real soul music is about."
5,Why Did It Take So Long,"I am so happy to see this day. Raphael should have done this a long time ago. Even when he was with other groups, he was the voice that stood out the most and captured the soul and spirit fo anyone listening. I like the old stuff that he's done but after listening to the samples from his solo CD, I have to get it 'Today'. I'm a fan for life and the 'gift' the he's blessed with will go a long way in uplifting anyone listening. Thank you so much Raphael, keep up the great work!"
2,Not even close,"This man has clearly given away his best material. Can he play instruments well? Sure, but the songs don't fly with me. A lot of it comes off like him tyring to keep up with the young kids today and it isn't even very good at mimicing that."
1,Instant Disappointment,"I found this album profoundly disappointing. After hearing Saadiq's contributions to many other artists (e.g., D'angelo's Voodoo album), not to mention his work with Tony Toni Tone, I was really looking forward to a soulful, melodic, slightly funky album. Instead I found a watered-down, overproduced piece of sugary fluff. No soul, and definitely no groove."
2,Not trippin',"Frankly, one the most anticipated and most disappointing albums of 2002. I am baffled as to what Saddiq wants to do here. The Lucy Pearl album is a much better showcase of his talents - to say nothing of Tony Toni Tone's ""House of Music"", which was sheer brilliance. I rarely listen to this album and do not recommend it."
4,Decent,"I think that this album is overall good, but some of the songs are a little bland. Maybe some of the 2- or 3-minute songs could have been left behind, as they don't make as big an impact as ""Be Here"" and ""People"" do. Also, the majority of the album has production that makes one or two songs seem indistinguishable from each other. Other than that, Instant Vintage was worth the wait."
3,It's just okay,"I listened to this song and thought it was just okay. I don't the understand the rave reviews for this cd. If you're looking for an excellent nu soul cd, get ""The Love Experience"" by Raheem DeVaughn. He is excellent!!!!!!"
1,I really tried...,"Based on the reviews, radio plays of other RS songs I decided to take Instant Vintage for a spin.I'm really disappointed.The orchestration is good, the beginning track shows that...but after that the lyrics fall flat. I'm upset because there are some good collaborations that seem like they would work, but when you hear them they don't.And whats up with that track in the middle of the CD with the female group singing? Pointless.I think I want to get his latest (Way I see it) but I'm apprehensive if I'm going to get critically acclaimed fluff."
2,"Love The Groovies, But.......","The sound on this recording sucks. I love The Flamin Groovies, and I also like when a live recording has a raw sound, but this isn`t really a raw recording. It`s just a low quality one. If you can find it for $5 I would say it is worth picking up, otherwise look else where to get your Groovies fix."
3,Good protection but discolors with sun exposure,"This works great for low impact bumper protection but stayed clear for only about 3 months. It's now brownish from exposure to the sun. I tried painting it, but the paint refused to stick properly, probably due to car wax.I'm sure it would still be clear if I didn't have to park in the sun, but next time I think I'll get it in black."
2,Clear but HIGHLY Visible,"Thick Material, ,it is very Substantial, Almost TOO Much so.. not optically Transparent Hence SO Highly Visible, almost makes car look unattractive.. Detracts from Car's appearance!"
5,Pretty god item bumper protector,"I got it very quick. Installed pretty easy,and only complaini would have ,that is clear and is give you a purplish color tone,and the glue shows baubles, they should put some light color backingfrom close it looks not to god,but is do the job, i already hit cars bumpers with it and you see nothing on my car, that was the purpose for it, right.Good stuff i recomended"
2,Only deals with the simple web server load balancing,"This deals mainly the web based load balancing. This is the simplest solution since the sessions only last for ms. It has a good hands on approach to router configuration and network design but lacks hardcore application design that this topic deserves.There is no discussion on complex systems which require sessions to last for days and how to distribute state between multiple servers. There is also no discussion on locking mechanisms, determining load, primary/backup determination, latency across WANs, distributed objects, DB failover, server synchronization, heartbeat implementations, shifting load for scheduled down time, or dynamic router configuration or alternative scheduling mechanism apart from round robin.I think the title ""Web Server Load Balancing"" would be a more appropriate title and if that is what your goal is then this is the book for you."
2,At the title I was impressed,"But after digging into the content I was forced to re-evaluate my first impression. I looked to this book to guide me through numerous pieces and choices of server load balancing on a fair but balanced agenda. What I found was far too much information that was simply digested and reformatted from vendor and free areas.I look to an expert on a topic to give new insight and twists to anything they write. The lack of any personal commitment or recommendation was surprising. Which made the book more into a mid-level technical guide with no path or strategy summary as I would expect. A good beginner type book for the basic information. It was well organized and had decent flow. Chapter 5 seemed to offer the most promise, but never quite concluded with anything concrete."
3,Server Load Balancing by Tony Bourke,"This publication is good for an quick introductory view of server load balancers. Users of load balancing products from certain manufacturers will benefit from the configuration options discussed in the final section of the book. For a more in-depth discussion, I would recommend Kopparapu's text ""Load Balancing Servers, Firewalls, and Caches""."
3,"Good for background, but too much on hardware solutions","This was actually a very good book. It really explains the background behind server load balancing very well. However, the book only emphasizes hardware solutions for server load balancing. It doesn't discuss any of the software solutions, such as Windows 2000 or IBM Edge Server.The only reason why I rated this book relatively low is that much of the theory behind server load balancing can be obtained for free from various web sites.If you're only looking for information about the concept of server load balancing, then you're better off getting the info from web sites for free. However, if you're also looking for great tips on the various load-balancing hardware solutions, then it's worth purchasing this book."
5,Excellent architectural coverage and practical use,"I found this to be an excellent, clear and concise introduction to web server load balancing and configuration.Highly recommended."
5,Shred On,I bought this shredder to replace the old one we used to death. It shreds as advertised. The autoshut-off when full is great. I would like to have a deeper wastecan for it. Great product and I would reccommend it for any one for home or moderate office use.
3,shredder,"Is smaller than I thought but works well. There was a shipping snafu and was sent one when the original never arrived and then today, 3 weeks later, the original arrived and will now have to ship it back but Amazon is pretty good about taking care of that."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I have had three of this model. Shows what a fool I am. The cross cut and size of the shredded paper isa plus. The automatic switch however craps out in a really short time. This to me negates everything else. Three of them where the auto switch has died on all three. This is ridiculous. I don't shred much at all, maybe 10 sheets a day. Handles CDs well. But the near worthless auto switch overrules the positive factors. If I wanted a shredder without an auto mode I would buy one. When I do buy one with auto I expect that to work and not stop in a very few months. I think I have finally learned a lesson and will never again buy an Aurora shredder. As far as I'm concerned they put out garbage."
4,Very Good,This has done everything promised. We haven't had one problem other than I wish it had a bigger area for paper to accumulate.
1,Breaks Easily,"This is the second time I've bought this product. The first one failed after a few months, but I thought it was my fault because I used it a lot and when it failed I thought maybe I had overused it. I ordered another one because I would have two containers and I thought it would be better for changing out the basket when I was too busy to empty it. I liked the way the cutters looked - nice and solid. After a couple of months of average use (I tried to be more careful with the second shredder) it began to make a weird noise - like the cutters were binding. Yesterday I tried shredding 1 CD and it only made it about way through the CD before locking up. I removed it cleaned out everything from the cutter and now all it does is make noise. It won't shred anything . I just don't think this shredder is worth the money. I really need a shredder and now I have to find another one. I wouldn't recommend this shredder to anyone. It just doesn't hold up - even when you baby it."
2,Aurora AS1018CD: Never leave in Automatic mode!,"I purchased this model, Aurora AS1018CD, and the next smallest size model within about a week of each other; one for home and one for my office. Both have done excellent in terms of their shredding power and low instance of jams or binding up, however they have both displayed an issue which causes me great concern; they will suddenly without reason begin running and will not shut off. Both have now done this on several occasions, and without any possible reason I can find, i.e. my Aurora AS1018CD was emptied and even blown clean with compressed air about 3 weeks ago and not used since- and the other morning I woke to find it running non-stop, and getting very warm. This has led me to not only turn both completely off, but unplug both from now on just to be on the safe side until I can have them replaced."
1,Died after 6 weeks!!!!,"A shredder in this price range should last for a while. It should be able to do moderate amount of shredding. Well after a few pages, an awful smell came out of the machine like rubber burning. Shut it down for an hour and started again and a few moments later the same thing......this happened every time we shredded. Finally one day it just stopped accepting papers into the feed. End of shredder. Buying a micro cutter one with only good reviews."
2,craptastic,I specifically picked out this shredder because it was suppose to shred CD/DVD and it gets jammed every single time you put a CD in. I tried multiples just in case it was just bad luck on that first disk. It shreds paper fantastically but I could have gotten a regular everyday shredder that did just paper for a hell of a lot cheaper. Definitely not worth the price don't buy it.
3,Personal,The product works as expected. I have been using it on a backlog of material to be shredded and it keeps up fine.
1,Worked for 6 months only,"I bought this shredder in March. In September it stopped working. It still has 1 year warranty, but it doesn't worth the shipping."
2,Another piece of Chinese junk,Used it for a couple weeks until the shredders came out of gear and it started making a high pitched screeching noise. Nothing shreds or reverses. Needless to say I need a return and refund.
4,Tear it up,Unit works great. When I received it the bottom of the unit had a small hair line crack in it. Now it's gotton alot bigger from using it.Would have given it (5) stars all the way if not for that.
1,Smelled funny and died. Aurora broke-alis,"Walmart sold these cheaper and even at that I feel taken. I assumed frmo the start 10 sheets meant 5 and I was right. Even 5 choked the poor thing. After only 4 basketfulls over a few days with many long breaks it began to smell plasticky even using 2-3 pages at a time. It never could approach 10 and try a CD, the noise it makes made me run for the fire extinguisher. All of a sudden it won't shred anything even a tissue without choking. Ive checked in the mechanism but nothing is fouling it that can be seen and its pretty open to see.Maybe I got a lemon but you could too. Get a different brand, this thing is way to stressed to even approach its overly hopeful rating of 150 pages a day and 10 pages at a time. 10 sheets of cigarette paper maybe :-PMine was garbage and a total waste of money"
1,restockit,after much research i selected this shredder and it came broken and was obviously returned once if not twice before based on the amount of packing tape on this box. would not buy anything from restock it again if their policy is to just keep sending out defective merchandise hoping someone will keep it and pay for it.
1,Broke after a few CDs,"I bought this shredder to replace an older Aurora model and to be able the shred some old CDs.While it worked very nicely with paper, CD's were a different story: After only a few CD's the machine was history. One CD got stuck with a loud noise, which was the last sound of the motor. Even after disassembling (and voiding the guarantee) the machine and extracting the remainders of the half-shredded CD, it never started working again...I am very disappointed ;-("
5,Aurora AS1018CD 10-Sheet Cross-Cut Paper/Credit Card/CD Shredder with Basket,"This Aurora AS1018CD 10-Sheet Cross-Cut Paper/Credit Card/CD Shredder has worked very well for many months now.We load it to its capability limit, which often proves greater than its ten sheet advertised capacity. We use plastic bags in the basket, which facilitates cleaner and less messy emptying. It ain't quiet, but none of the shredders are at this price point range.Buy another? Sure, but not for several more years at the rate this one is performing."
5,Super Shredder!,"This is probably the best home/small office shredder I have ever used. You can feed it stacks of documents & cards & as long as you follow the directions of pages & time running it will perform 100% correctly & quickly. Although a bit noisy, who cares as long as it gets the job done properly!"
1,Find a better shredder,"Shredder lasted about 8 months and only works ""sometime"". The motor is slow and is jams when it does decide to work"
4,Solid shredder,"After 2 months of moderate use, including 2 or 3 days of very heavy use, the shredder is going strong with no signs of any problems. I generally don't try to test a shredder's sheet capacity claims, but certainly have shredded 7-8 sheets numerous times without any incidents of rebellion! Capacity is quite adequate for a smallish machine, since unlike many shredders, this one does not shut down well before the basket is full. So far, so good, which, when it comes to shredders, is a very positive review."
4,Working well one month later,"It has only been one month, but I've used this to shred a few CDs, credit cards and tons of paper. I have not had any problems at all. It is noisy when in action but I like to think it is the torque in action."
5,Excellent Shredder,This shredder is as advertised in the specifications. I use my shredder everyday. My last Aurora shredder lasted about 7 years.I have use the shredder for 2 months before posting this review. Very Pleased.
1,One bad unit,"I bought this product after reading the largely positive reviews here on Amazon. I guess I got one of the units that quality assurance missed.I shredded one full basket without problems. I was impressed with the speed of the unit and pleased that while the basket is relatively small, the cross shredding process allows denser packing of paper than the older unit I was replacing. I was careful not to exceed the 10 sheet limit, I did not try to shred any credit cards or CD's, and I removed all staples before shredding.As the red light lit, indicating the second basket was full, I heard a loud noise followed by a high-pitched whine. A call to tech support verified that the drive gears has stripped. I was advised to return the unit to Amazon to avoid a shipping charge to the factory in California. I got through to tech support with no wait and the person I talked to was knowledgeable and spoke colloquial english. I mailed the unit back today."
5,better then expected,"Purchased this item with a gift certificate.All members of the family have been using this shredder now, from shredding credit cards, several pages of paper....to shredding CD's and data disks.This shredder has taken everything in, and seemed to handle it effortlessly!I was very, very surprised about the sturdy design, and how heavy in weight it is. (Which is, no doubt, a good thing in this case!)I highly, highly recommend this shredder, not only for home use, but a business as well.I would buy again, without hesitation!"
1,AURORA AS1018CD,"After about a year the shredder stopped working; the motor ran but the cutters stopped turning. I disassembled the unit and discovered that the two main gears that transfer motion from the motor to the cutting assembly are made of plastic or nylon. The first gear contacting the motor shaft had stripped, rendering the shredder inoperable. This is a poor design; I would not recommend this unit."
5,The Oracle is Always Right!,"I got the a copy of The Ladie's Oracle in college - almost 16 years ago. My girlfriends and I swear by it - the Oracle has great knowledge, but we have found, she can be pretty rude too if destiny is not with you. In the end, she is always right,especially on matters of love. Trust in her, and don't use her on off days, and remember, you can always ask her again tomorrow and your fate may change.Don't hesitate to buy this - I've been looking for copies in print every year since the mid 90's, and this is the first I've seen. You will love her, and keep this book with you forever!"
5,FORTUNE TELLING AT IT'S BEST,"What a brilliant book, being interested in fortune telling, tarot etc,I was fortunate enough to come across this book ""THE LADIES ORACLE"". A group of friends and I sat all night asking the book questions, the hours of fun just rolled by. i would recommend this book to all the ladies out there, but ""BEWARE"", THIS BOOK IS ADDICTIVE.... happy reading."
4,Pretty good remixes that add diversity to the single!,"The sign of a good remix is how it alters the original without destroying the integrity and performance of the artist. David Morales, the primary ""composer"" for the first two of these ""restructurings"" of the Aretha hit, understands that, as does Charles ""The Mixologist"" Roane, responsible for the last two.While Morales ""ups the ante"" with strong dance reworkings, Roane slows the frenzy down with highly sensual versions, destined to get the listener in a different mindset.Track Listings and times:1. Morales Mix (radio edit) - 3:312. Morales Classic Mix - 9:253. Bump Mix - 3:364. Mixologist Bass Mix (with rap) - 3:36Total running time: 20:00"
1,BLOOD GORE AND IN-BREEDING TRASH,"I have a pretty flexible attitude when it comes to gore and/or sexual aberrations, but WEDDING SLASHERS pushes the limit. The tale of a young woman whose boyfriends end up dying horrible deaths at the hands of her multiply inbred family is ridiculously scripted and the acting is non-existent. The only ""name"" actor in the cast is Richard Lynch, who doesn't come in until close to the end as the potential bride's father. The movie treats its killings sadistically and there are characters in the movie who we never know who they are. A really bad and not one of those cheesy bad movies. Don't get engaged in this one folks."
4,"Good Switch, A Bit Cheap","These switches feel a bit cheap but work well otherwise. The construction of the base allows for easy mounting into a round hole. I've had one of these serving as a switch for some LED lighting inside my car and it hasn't failed yet, after 6 months or use. The Blue LED is starting to become a bit dimmer, though.Overall pretty happy. These are cheap enough to buy a few at a time anyway."
3,I've got to get an MP3 player,"I bought this CD for one song and it is beautiful. However,I don't like anything else on it. What's worse, I have found two more songs by Eddie Holloman on two other CDs that I would like to have. Needless to say, buying the three of these cuts individually, would not be as much as the one CD. I've learned my lesson and my next purchase will be an MP3 player!"
3,Great balladeer,"I basically wanted the CD for one song, ""You make my life complete"". Beautiful song! Rest of CD wasn't as good."
5,They don't make them like this anymore,"Those people who moan about the quality of this DVD are simply missing the point. This is Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood and the Faces doing what they do best. Singing and playing up a storm while having a truck load of fun in the process. When Keith Richards joins the band and he and Ronnie Wood masterfully weave their guitars together on the beautifully performed ""I would rather go blind"" you know you've got your monies worth right there. Yes everyones wasted and yes the recordings not as good as todays offerings but don't let that fool you into thinking this is something to pass over. Rock and roll moments don't come much better than this. It's raw, dirty, beautiful and raucous. Ignore the nay sayers and pick this up. You won't be disappointed and if you are...you're just not rock and roll."
2,WARNING...NO RONNIE LAINE!!!,"I suppose I should have done my math, Ronnie Laine left the Faces in 1973, not wanting his heart broken again, like it was when Steve Marriott left the Small Faces. He knew Rodlington was going to leave and start his solo gig, so Ronnie beat him to the punch, and booked. I love those guys, and Tetus Yamauchi is a cool enough bass player,but I would not have purchased this if i'd known there was no Ronnie playing, singing, and smiling..."
1,Could have been one of the coolest but...,"I had already seen bootleg(black market?) stuff of this video before I bought this official one. Great stuff, really. How I wished this amazing video would have been released in official... Then, wow!! My wish was finally granted. BUT!!!Well... it's just sooo sad. Picture is much better than the one I had(bootleg one), of course. But sound... I don't know how you call it... Hmmm, ah, tape's running speed is faster than the way it's supposed to be. I mean, it's a music video, right? I'd rather watch ... picture with right sound than this...."
2,46 year old rocker!,"Well, out of all my rock DVD's, this one takes the cake. I give the sound a 2 out of 10, Picture a 4. If you like to see grown men look and ack like girls, this DVD is for you. What nerve people have to put this out. Stick your but in someone elses face Rod, and I'll stick to the tough guys."
4,"Despite faults, still enjoyable!","It's true that the sound and picture quality on this disc are not up to par with most DVD releases, but it is still a very entertaining film for any fans of the Faces, Rod Stewart, or the Rolling Stones.The setlist is fantastic, even without the Faces' best-known song (""Stay With Me"") and the contributions of the then-departed Ronnie Lane (""Ooh La La"", etc.). The Faces take on Berry (""Sweet Little Rock N' Roller""), among other classics (""Angel"", ""It's All Over Now""), and play a few of the members' solo numbers. The personal highlight for me, as a Rolling Stones fan, was getting to see Keith Richards at a point in time when the Stones were inactive. It was obvious even then that he and future bandmate Ronnie Wood had some good chemistry going.The film is definitely rough around the edges (even the packaging gives it the appearance of a bootleg), but if you can get past that, there are some fantastic perfomances on here."
1,For giggles only!,"This is one horrible DVD! The transfer is from a terrible 16mm film with breaks and scratches everywhere. And forget the sound... I bought it mainly to watch one of the great Hammond players, Ian McLagan... Too bad the sound destroys all fidelity. The one saving grace is the pure hysteria of watching Rod Stewart prance around and mug away! These guys (Faces) were great musicians. Sone of that talent penetrates the din every now and then. But don't waste your money..."
3,Depression no more.,Have been taking it for two weeks. I don't find that it helps with hot flashes but I feel much better overall. It does help depression trememdously and I feel better and much less stressed but I do find that my appetite has increased some.
1,I doubt,"This product may be good for others, but not for me. I am already taking the second bottle, because I ordered two. Nothing happened, no good no bad."
1,bad impression on Amazon's service,"I had ordered 10 bottles of Maca in Aug 2006. After receiving them, i notised that the expired date was Feb/Mar 2007. If i start to consume based on instruction (3 daily) from Sept 2006 onwards, then 10 bottles would have lasted me up to about Aug 2007. Thus I asked for replacement for 6 of them. The replacement was fast and good, but when I received them, they are still having Feb/Mar 2007 expiry date.This is a really lousy experience! I have wasted my time waiting and money re-sending them overseas from US. I have asked from replacement again on 22 Sept 2006, hope that this time the replacement can have expiry date beyong Sept 2007"
1,I can't believe I bought this book !,"I have been a computer user for over 20 years now - I've installed Win 3, 3.1, 3.11, 95, NT, 98 so I am very expert at installations and useage of the O/SI thought I'd get a jump start on the Windows ME environment and I got this book, based on the ratings here at Amazon.com. This book is nothing more than a beginning computer user's ""How To"" book. It tells you what a mouse is..what a Disk is..I mean, come on. The book is supposed to be about Windows ME, and instead is a ""Kiddie's Guide to your First PC"""
5,Surprising,"Wow. I did not expect much from this film, but it definitely delivered.The story was riveting and fresh. Had a solid ending too. Took a while to understand it all, but I love that about it."
5,Spyro the Dragon games are top of the line!!!!!,"I own over 70 Playstation 1 and 2 games combined. In all of the games I have played the Spyro games are still the greatest and my most favorite. Spyro combines adventure, puzzles, mystery, awesome graphics, spectacular characters, and suprise. They are games that you can sit down and totally enjoy. I can't wait until Spyro The Year of the Dragonfly comes out on Playstation2!! I just wish there were more games out there like Spyro and so far nothing has come very close. This game is great for children as well as adults. I am 32 and absolutely loved it. I hope to find more games like Spyro but in the mean time will keep revisiting Spyro and Sparx every so often when I miss them!! :) :) :)"
5,Great for Spyro Fans everywhere!,"I have beena Spyro fan for quite some time and my games get worn out rather regularly. I love this collection because it's a chance to get all the ""oldies but goodies"" all at once! It also makes a great gift for friends who are also addicted to the cute little purple guy."
5,A Great Buy!!!,"I don't own the Spyro games yet,(I ordered them off of amazon.com for Christmas)but I have played them at my cousin's house. They are sooo much fun! Get this: Even my grandmother was interested in them, she loves to watch us play Spyro on our PS1. This is an awsome buy because when the games are sold individually, they can cost up to [amount]. But in this package, you can get 3 games for the price of 2. I saw this in a store, and it cost [amount]. So you are saving between [amount[ to [amount] for some great games! I give this 5 stars and recomend it to everyone."
1,Imagine Me & YOu,I ordered this movie by mistake asI did not realize the theme of this movie a practice that I find appalling.
2,concern,"enjoyed what little i saw in 12 minutes; would like to have at least 15 more minutes, sorry but was disapointed, mike jarrells"
5,Fabulous stuff!,"I love this facial scrub! I use it every night and it's made my skin amazing. It's not too harsh to use everyday, for me anyway, and I can't recommend it highly enough."
3,Facial Scrub,"This facial scrub is quite refreshing at first. I don't really enjoy the way you have to use it though. It is kind of a hassle trying to pick the right amount out of the little jar and adding some water and getting it on to your face in a timely/not so messy manner. The smell is alright, but afterwards there always seems to be a little bit of a residue left on my face, no matter how much I rinse it off again. Maybe it's just me but I don't find myself 'excited' to use this product. I love burt's bees products normally and I was a bit disappointed with this one."
4,Baby Smooth,This made my face feel smooth and extra clean. It's gentle enough to use every day and smell yummy :)
4,Cleans without drying,"If you like the squeeky clean feel, then you probably will not like the moist and supple feel your skin will have after this scrub. It cleans without drying out my skin, which is hard to find. Smells great, too! Not as citrusy as I thought...more spicy like their Bay Rum collection. Thanks!"
3,THIS WILL NOT CLEAR ACNE,I have combination skin with mild acne. I bought this hoping this would be the product that would clear my acne but it didnt. I do LOVE this product though. If you do not have acne and you are looking for a scrub this would be great for you. The smell was really bad at first but then I began to love it. It is difficult to apply at first because it comes out in pieces. When I used it I took some out with my finger and put it in the palm of my hand and then I put pieces on my face and started rubbing it in. This is gentle enough to use daily. It did make the parts of my face that don't have acne smooth. If I didn't have acne I would use this daily :-) Hope this helps. p.s I started using the Dermalogica Clean Start Kit for my acne and my face is starting to clear up!
2,Love Burt's Bees but not this product,"I have fairly dry skin that doesn't give me many problems, other than extreme dullness. I rarely break out but I do struggle with dry skin that lacks radiance. I decided to try this scrub because I love Burt's Bees products and I figured a scrub would liven up my skin. The first three days or so, I liked it. It's fun to use and smells nice. But after a while, I noticed that I had a lot of dirt embedded in my pores. My pores are normally very tiny and I don't get blackheads. However, I began sprouting dark spots all over my face, especially near my nose. Once I quit using this, my skin cleared up again. Maybe it's not meant for dry skin. If you do use this, I'd only scrub with it a few times a week and make sure you use another cleanser that has serious deep-cleaning properties, because this citrus scrub doesn't deep clean. I found a better scrub with that St. Ives stuff, but I guess this is worth a try. Just don't expect it to deep clean."
3,"Nice scrub, if you need one","I think this stuff is edible. It smells like a grandma's kitchen at Christmas, but I found it a bit dry to use. You kind of have to dig it out of the jar and it is so dry it crumbles. I did not dislike this product, but I don't really care to use a scrub on my face. I think if you have sensitive skin, you might want to give this a try.Ingredients:Vegetable glycerin, sweet almond oil, almonds, oat flour, orange peel powder, rose petal powder, pecan shell powder, grapefruit seed extract, nutmeg powder, clove powder, orange oil, tocopherol (vitamin E), rosemary extract, fragrance. 99.94% natural."
2,not so good for me,well it smells so nice and it feels so nice and soft and well i honestly thought this worked for me but after like 10 days my face started to get black heads on my forhead and ckeeks so i stopped using its just breaking me out!!!!
4,Pretty good,"I read about this product in an online article about the best and worst of skin care. I ordered the 2oz. because I wasn't sure how it'd work and I couldn't find it locally. The verdict: IT'S PRETTY GOOD! My face is oily and I have rosacea, and it did a great job."
5,Works better than any other skin care product!,"I have occasional breakouts and I usually turn to my normal skincare regimen (Nutragena acne solutions or something), but I bought this a couple years back and then put it under my sink and forgot about it. I used it a couple weeks ago after cleaning out my bathroom and I have to say it works better than nutragena! Ok, well I still use a salicylic acid scrub before I use this, but I have definitely seen an improvement in the clarity of my skin after using it. It smells really good too, like pumpkin pie!"
3,Pretty Good,"I read this book and I am a 6th grader. I read it be because it was a book that the whole class had to read. I will tell you I get straight a's and even though I get a's it seriously was a very hard book. I mean there is all these names like Prometheus, Odysseus, Eurytheus, Medusa, Jason, Polydectes, Zeus, Hercules, and many, many more characters than that. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who gets stressed on things when you don't get something or somebody who is younger."
2,Amateur,"This CD is VERY cheesy. The synth sounds are very MIDI, and sound so amateur. I bought this CD because I saw it on the attack 9 website, and I love both Freescha and Casino vs Japan. I assure you, this CD is nowhere near the caliber of those two. I only gave it two stars because some of the beats are decent. Other than that, I can say I will never listen to it again.There is, however, some good news. I have heard worse! Check out Bochum Welt if you don't believe me."
5,The BEST!,"this is the most amazong product I have ever used on my face---and I put a LOT of stuff on my face! Pond's really needs to bring this back. If they don't, I'm going to be REALLY upset!!"
2,This is not the tape you see!,I got this tape and on the box it says it's a 40 minute tape. It's a 60 minute low impact with weights tape and does not just focus on the upper body! What gives?!
3,not enough intensity,"This workout really does not work well with me. I really feel my arms and shoulders IN THE BEGINNING of the workout, but after a while it really does not feel like I am working out. When the segment with Susan Harris(Vol.1) comes on, I really don't feel any contractions. This is so ironic because that is one of the hardest segments in the Firm Total Body Vol 1 tape."
3,Excellent subject matter... terrible narration.,"The description pretty much sums this up. Ten part series with many mass murderers discussed that have never been mentioned before in DVD format including a fairly good account of ""Heaven's Gate"" suicide cult. Also of interest is a look at Joseph Wesbecker's shooting spree at the Standard Gravure plant in Kentucky. What hurts this otherwise interesting series is a terrible narrator who lapses into dialectic quotes from the killers. His snide and cynical attempts of ironic humor undermine the proceedings tremendously. If not for this, the two disc set would rate at least four stars. Still, if your bag is crime documentaries this is pretty much essential and a great deal for the price."
2,shock to my system,"i thought this product was going to really be insightful, i started watching it and became bored almost instantly, i wish there was a way to preview before i actually purchased the dvd, because i would definitely not have purchased."
2,get the earplugs,"not a great live album. the quality is total crap, poor choice of songs, and the good songs they play dont even sound like they're being performed by discharge"
5,Very satisfied with purchase,Very satisfied with purchase - received exactly what I ordered in a timely manner.
1,Worst Doctor Who episode ever...,"This is the worst Doctor Who adventure that Ive ever seen. Ive seen everything, mind you, from the 1963-1989 run (and I mean everything), and this is the stupidest and cheesiest one of them all. Having the Doctor battle bounty hunters and aliens at a rock and roll, 50s style holiday is as bad as it sounds. Terrible writing, bad music, silly makeup, etc., make this the worst Doctor Who adventure ever. It's worst than Hartnell's The Gunfighters (which was considered the worst in Doctor Who history until this one), and it's worse than the American TV movie of the Doctor.McCoy and the cast try their best, but they can't overcome the thinness and triteness of the writing. McCoy was a good Doctor (none of the actors who have played the Doctor are awful, in fact, they're all very good), but he couldn't save the show by this time. The show was going down fast near the end of the 80's, and it was cancelled outright in 1989. Episodes like this hastened its downfall."
1,"Hands down, this is the worst.","I'm a big fan of the show. I seen the bulk of the Doctor Who run (from both series) including many of the recreations of the lost episodes. All shows have good and bad episodes; and you know that there is something special about a show when the bad episodes are entertaining (I have a deep soft spot for Horns of Nimon). But, Delta and the Bannermen is joyless pap. There is nothing redeeming about it. The acting is bad, the story doesn't work, the premise is ridiculous, Mel is at her worst, the bad guys make no sense, the supporting cast are totally shallow and make bizarre decisions, and worst of all it revolves around the 80s obsession with the 50s.I'd rather watch a marathon of Time-Flight, Fear Her, Two Doctors, Timelash, and Twin Dilemma over watching this again. It makes Creature from the Pit look like a masterpiece.So many great episodes were lost, yet this survives. ech."
1,Bye Bye Doctor!,"I grew up watching Dr. Who. There isn't a Doctor that I didn't like--no LOVE. Until....until McCoy. I tried so hard to like him, but episodes like this made me loathe the man, and where he took the series. This may be the worst episode of Dr. Who I have ever seen. There is nothing redeeming about this one. I own the entire Who series, and I am passing on this, because the thought of having to endure this episode again causes me physical pain"
4,The Mournful Sounds that Keep the Insomnia Awake!,"The music that David Julyan conducts for this film is almost superior to that of memento. The music fits the film 100%. The mournful and guilt ridden sounds of the music fit that of Pacino's character. It is a beautifully composed album. The opening title track fits over the bleak cold landscape of the opening sequence, very very well. If you liked the musis of Memento, then you will like this. BUY IT!!!!!"
4,"Broodingly Atmospheric, Haunting - It matches the film","We have a wide range of reviews about this film, from the borderline pretentious that need to remind everyone it's a remake although the film does that itself (not to mention complain about it), to the ADD-inflicted ""this was boring"" crowd.Ultimately, the score for this film effectively captured the brooding and occasionally melancholy tone. Personally, this may be one of the very few remakes that I thought was more effective than the original film, albeit they're both masterpieces.I'm dropping a star for the score's monotony, but it's ultimately very smart, very tragic, and very beautiful. A magnificent film from a director that's really headed toward terrific fame. I can't wait for his Hughes biopic."
3,"transplants rock,not bad",clean version of haunted cities isn't that bad.the good part is they dont beep it out.They just dont say anything.
2,***Important: This is NOT a divided hamper,"When you search Amazon for ""divided laundry hamper"" one of the choices you get is this hamper. Good looking, yes, but NOT divided. It's one canvas bag with a frame on top that's divided, but the space below is not divided."
3,The Details Are A Bit Disappointing,"I purchased this piece to match my already existing dark woods and on that note I am pleased. I feel it is a shade lighter then the picture, but overall it is a dark tone. I do like this hamper, but I am completely ill gotten over a few of the details.My only complaint revolves around the two strips of molding circling the unit. The molding is fashioned in a straight forward raised bevel, but the edges are completely rough. Even the corner pieces the wood are entirely too brazen and it does not match the rest of the unit's smooth build. The saving grace is the piece is just dark enough to hide those details unless it is viewed under close inspection. In the end those minor blemishes are rather disappointing when compared to the other outstanding qualities."
4,superb collection,"This is one of the better compilations from Silva America. While not as good as the Space and Beyond series this is still a good CD to have. Just check out the composers:John Williams (The Towering Inferno, Poseidon Adventure, Earthquake), Alan Silvestri (Volcano), James Newton Howard (Dante's Peak), Jerry Goldsmith (The Swarm), James Horner (Titanic), John Barry (Raise The Titanic)Be sure to check out the Monster Movie Music album as well."
3,Cocktail Shaker,"This is a cool idea. As a plain cocktail shaker, it works great. However, very quickly the lettering for the drink recipes begins to rub off. If they could find a way to make the lettering more durable it would be awesome. Until then, it is just mediocre."
3,Call Bionaire Directly,"If you have a Bionaire console humidifier, you need these filters, which should be replaced roughly every two months.But as much as I enjoy using Amazon (been a Prime member for years), this is not the product to purchase from Amazon. Call Bionaire directly. Instead of complaining about getting a non-Bionaire replacement, you'll get the genuine product, often for less. As I write this, they are having a 40% off sale on filters -- filters <$8, wicks <$10 per pair -- and free shipping on orders over $25.NOTA BENE: Bionaire no longer includes the plastic frames with the wicks, either, SO KEEP YOUR FRAMES! Also, they sell the wicks as a single item, not a twin pack, so for my W-9 I needed to order in pairs."
3,Didn't quite fit,The product received is slightly larger than the original Bionaire filter though it appears to be made from the same material. Price is right but make take a little work to fit your unit.
3,The robot storyline continues...,"So, it may not be the best story ever written, but it does carry on the Asimov Robots storyline. If you can quote the three laws of robotics, you gotta read this whole series. It will not knock your socks off or anything, but you will enjoy it."
5,"Harmony, Unity, Divinity","Ghazal has produced a timeless combination of music that is likevipassana meditation which recognizes the divinity in all of life. The sitar, kamanche, and tabla are for the most part the only instruments. As the mind listens to each instrument, interplay, and create harmonies, an ecstatasy of enchantment arises and creates waves of bliss ... this bliss lasts for hours after listening. If opening your chakras means anything to you, this CD will do it: your heart will expand wider & wider into a state of love for *ALL* of life. You will realize existence is precious. I agree with former reviewers: ""Snowy Mountain"" is my favorite. The music resonates with my very being and makes me very happy. This music is similar to Sufi mediatation music --- it is probably the closest thing to a mystical experience some of us will ever have! Don't hesitate ... BUY IT! Erika Borsos (erikab93)"
2,Dull,There is too much sameness from one piece to the next. I guess I was expecting music from different places along the Silk Road.
5,nice,Excellent rubber bands. I just need another dozen words before they'll let me submit this review. Here they are now.
5,THE essential reference on RN capital ships,"First published in 1976, this book remains THE definitive technical history of all RN battleship and battlecruiser classes from World War II, invaluable to historians and model-makers alike.The book starts with comprehensive class-by-class reviews of the ships as first built, and then deals with subsequent alterations and additions. The subject is covered in immense detail, supported by numerous photographs and highly accurate constant-scale drawings. Though expensive, this book should be sought out by anyone with a detailed interest in British capital ships of the WWII era.The authors also published an equally comprehensive study of the various RN cruiser classes of the same era - this, again, is an essential source for enthusiasts and model-makers."
5,Essential reading,"Splendid book. Had it ever since it apeared on the market, and find it continuously useful. US Naval Institute SHOULD consider reprinting it with utmost despatch. In the plethora of their titles that border at times on nonsense, this one stands out as a book of value to professionals and amateurs alike, and remains among the outstanding issues on the subject. As per RN's pipe: ""Wakey, wakey, USNI, rise and shine, the sun is scotching the eyes out of your head...etc."""
2,Not very helpful if you are not a devout Christian,The author seems to imply way too often in the book that God is the answer to all. I had to stop reading every time she did that.
2,Better books exist,"Since the break up of our 6 year relationship I have purchased many books. This one was not as helpful as the others because the information was very introductory and not deep enough. It seemed like the book is saying that God is the answer to saving the marriage. Maybe true, but I was hoping for a book with more deep psychological analysis. I recommend the books ""Letting Go"" by Dr. Tracy Cabot, and ""Make Up Don't Break Up"" by Dr. Bonnie Eaker Weil."
3,"Too ""religious""","This book gave me food for thought. However it was ""too religious"" for me and the general population. It was a little ""blaming"" of the left-out spouse."
3,"RETURN TO ""Punk Rock is Dead"" PLEASE","Not a bad album but not a great one either still better than that steaming pile of excrement put out by osaka popstar.Michale unfortunately just doesn't seem to realise the only person enjoying his forays into being a ""serious"" musician is Michale himself.That said ""One Moment Away"" and ""We Wait"" are kind of catchy.""The House"" sees Michale back on form and ""No one thinks about me"" is ok even though the Nirvana influence is about as subtle as a baseball bat too the face.""Punk Rock Is Dead"" may have been less polished but it worked betterMichale shines when he's singing about Horror Buisness but he just needs too put the ghosts of Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain to rest."
5,Great to have my own copy,It just wouldn't be Christmas without seeing this special each year. One of my all-time favourites. Now we can view it whenever we want to. Peter Paul and Mary are long-time favourites of mine.
5,great concert,"There's nothing better than listening to Peter, Paul and Mary sing some fantastic songs--especially since Mary's passing--it's really done well."
3,I'm disappointed,"This is a great concert, but a very poor quality tape. (DVD, or course) It was much better on PBS."
3,"Peter, Paul & Mary Holiday Concert",Overall I was disappointed because of the lack of traditional Christmas songs. The last four or five songs were traditional songs but the first part of the DVD was songs I've never heard and didn't at all make me feel Christmascy. At least the sound quality was excellent.
2,the holiday concert,"this had all the makings for a real good show that did not show up. they managed to sing every slow and humbdrum song ever created. if your intention is to sleep, this is it. too much choir and not enough orchestra is also some of the problem. mostly, just poor song selections and letting the first half of the show drag along. they tried to reach too deep and forgot how to entertain."
2,It didn't work,"I would like to return it, It didn't work . If I could get a replacement that does work that would be good, Thank you"
5,Fond Memories,This was a replacement for my VHS edition. The clarity was improved as was the sound quality. I grew up listening to PP&M. It brought back very fond memories. PP&M belong in the pantheon of the greats.
4,Just what my wife wanted,"She's been looking for the DVD for years. Video quality could have been better, but given how old this concert is and it was a PBS special there probably wasn't anything better available."
1,Not worth the money...,"I love Native American romances!! This one did not deliver on what I enjoy reading in a romance novel. The heroine was childish and spoiled. Her aunt was too much of a nag. Although the hero was interesting, I didn't feel overwhelmed by him like I have with other Native American heroes. Plus, where was the sex??!! Most connoisseurs of romance novels do not necessarily like to read material that is ""pornographic,"" but SOME sex is expected. If you blink, you'll miss it in this one!! I felt like the author rushed to get her manuscript in and abruptly ended the last scene. It was so anti-climactic. If you like Native American romances, stick with authors who have the experience in writing them like J. Lindsey's ""Savage Thunder,"" K. Drymon's ""Gentle Savage,"" J. Redd's ""Steal the Flame,"" anything by Karen Kay, B. Joyce's ""Darkest Heart,"" or anything by Colleen Faulkner. You can't go wrong with those authors."
2,Mildly entertaining gobbledygook,"Yet another of the many New Agey religions that are springing up in Japan like weeds these days. The big-nosed demons are good, as is the bit about what Moses is doing these days (he's busy remodeling hell), but other than that it's just run-of-the-mill rainbows-and-dolphins feelgooderism. Give it a miss."
5,All that is not told in Christianity you can find in here.,"Reading this book I can understand where I stand in this life and why I am feeling this way. The explanation of the interrelation of each dimension of the Universe to the human mind and soul is like a bible for me. Very important for me was also to find the understanding that there is not one past Religion that has not its purpose for the development of today's world. Hate for other cultures and Religion has no place in an evolution but LOVE, Knowledge, Reflection and Development."
5,"Want to Learn More About Christinanity, Must Read!","This explains much clearer about the mystery of Christinanity. It's well-written so that anyone can read without having hard time understanding. I couldn't find this kind of book anywhere before. I learned one and the only thing we can take to the other world after death is our mind. That's why it is so important to improve ourselves in this world! Read so that you can, too learn the importance of love, knowledge, reflection, and development."
5,Just Listen...,"There are many reasons for buying this disc but one stands out for me. Put on the First movement and listen to the Second subject theme when it reappears after the anguished development. At this point Tchaikovsky outdoes himself and let's loose a theme of such magnificent melancholy that it is hard to comprehend. The extension to the theme (first heard earlier in the movement) is, in my opinion, Tchaikovsky's finest hour!. And Karajan and the BPO, like the rest of the symphony, play it with such grandeur and passion as to silence all would-be rivals. Have NO reservations------this CD HAS to be in your collection."
5,Excellent!,"This book contains twenty-five of the finest sermons ever given. From Jesus, Isaiah, and Paul to Clement, Chrysostom, and Augustine; from the Venerable Bede, Luther, and Calvin to Edwards, Chalmers, and Whitefield; and all the way to Finney, Wesley, Spurgeon, and Morgan - this book covers the spectrum of Christian preaching from beginning to end. Pastors can read them to learn more about preaching, historians can read them as Christian history, and Bible teachers can read them to learn how these great men taught, but no one can read these sermons and not be turned toward God. This is an excellent collection of excellent sermons by excellent men of God - what more do you need?"
2,...,"This toy is cute, but after five minutes you hate it. It's so fragile, and it won't shut up because there's no off button. The batteries never seem to run out.Don't buy it, it's a total waste of money."
1,Save yourselves !,"If you are a Norse enthusiast and are expecting another independent film similar to ' Severed Ways ' or ' Valhalla Rising ' - then you are going to need to wait for the next one - because this isn't it. I was embarassed to view the entirety, but fortunately didn't watch it with anyone else - otherwise I'd be banned from suggesting new movies. Ten dollars is a great deal for a film like ' Arn - The Templar Knight ' or ' Centurion ' if you are interested in historic fiction with integrity, but my purchase of ' Fimbulvinter ' ended up as a dvd hanging in my garden to deter deer from eating my vegetables - fortunately for the wildlife - they won't have to see the film - that would just be cruel."
5,Charmed Again,In Charmed Again Phoebe and Piper are still grieveing for the loss their elder sister Prue. Not only has Prue died but with her went the Power of Three leaving the other sisters vulnerable to demon attack. Just as it seems as everything is lost for the Charmed Ones they find themselves faced with a woman who seems to be their half-sister...
4,A brill introduction to paige,"i haven't seen the episode charmd agian so i decided to read the book, nicely written and a star buy for anyone who has or hasn't seen the episode. the first novel with Cole and paige and also the back history of All hell breaks loose. worth a read"
4,Charmed Again,"The book was alright, It tells of how Paige became a charmed one, and of Piper and Phoebe dealing with the loss of Prue, it's alright but my only complaint is they didn't mention Prue much."
1,no Prue?,I kind of feel that Prue was killed off too easily. Amd the whole Paige-situation just doesn't make sense...how could there be a power of three with Paige in the picture? And how possible is it to hide things from Them? Paige's powers are just a stronger form of Prue's. And I also think that Paige is sort of un-Paige-like in this book. She's not the same Paige on the TV series.
4,The Power Of Three,"I love Charmed! In the Season 3 Finale, Prue Halliwell, the eldest sister dies by a demon named Shax. When Piper and Phoebe has the funeral they dont except to find another sister who could bring the Power Of Three back together to stop the evil in the world. This book is set 1 week after the death of the beloved Prue Halliwell. If you liked the Episode ""Charmed Again"" you will love the book! I sure did!"
5,Great 'Charmed' Adaptation :),"This book is based on the first two eps of Season 4 and part of the episode 'All Hell Breaks Loose' from the end of Season 3.Great telling of how Paige became part of the Halliwell clan. I love the character of Paige, reminds me of Phoebe from the early season of Charmed. Better than how they made Phoebe later on in the show, did they think a family colud only have one free spirit?I also like how they included a bit of what happened between the gaps of the season 3 finale and the beginning of Season 4 but it would been better if they would had a book based on this ep as well.Anyways, aside from a couple typing errors... this is one of the best Charmed books out now. Only complaint is that they didn't mention Prue's name alot :(.Highly recommend to 'Charmed' fans! *G* Along with 'Soul of the Bride', this author and Diana Gallagher (sp?) get the personalities/quirks of the Halliwells and their family/friends just right."
5,Best book of the Charmed series? I think so!,"This the the best book, in my opinion! The story after Prue(the oldest sister) is gone and the other sisters have to survive with the power of two for a while then another mystery sister suddenly appers to take Prue's place! Read please!"
3,charmed again,Although this is a good book I feel that it cuts Prue out too fast at the beginning they should really have a whole book explaining the whole affair as non-TV watchers might be confused. And also when did the sister's dad come back into their lives all of a sudden. The one thing that annoys me with all the books is that they explain the sisters powers and things every time but never other important things. I know I've been quite negative but I would recommend this book and all the charmed books to anyone.
5,Excellent Presentation on Creationsim and Evolution,Bone of Contention is the best presentation of the truths of the Bible as contrasted to the claims of evolution. Ms. Baker has done an excellent job in presenting the evidences for both and leaving the conclusions to the reader. Good reading for high school aged youth to adults!
5,Easy practical recipes and the stories that go with them,Easy to follow recipes with fascinating vignettes that could come from any family. Delightful to read and practical to use.
3,Enter witty yet concise title here,"This book is pretty neat. Although I read it over a year ago, at the time I felt that it conveyed the feelings of the hostages accurately (however I've never been a hostage so I am not neccessarily an expert in this area). I would reccommend it to someone who likes to read about hostage situations or perhaps someone involved in hostage negotiations. (who am I kidding, I am probobly the only one who is ever going to read this review:)"
1,Just junk.,"Unfortunately this caliper is just junk. There are a number of rough edges and burrs remaining on the ""machining"" (I think its stamping). The slide feel is very rough and seems innacurate. The Starrett caliper, which this imitates, is precisely machined, silky smooth and always comes back to zero when the caliper is closed. Of course it costs $80.82 from Amazon and this one costs only $30.98 ($23.99 plus $6.99 shipping). But for the extra 50 bucks you get a caliper that you can use and even enjoy!!I don't know about the other similar brands: Quint, I-gaging, General, and Oshlun. My recommendation is DO NOT BUY the Peachtree PW1241!"
5,Ska down,"This is one of my favoraties and I own a lot of Ska. It is better then volume one with hard to find tracks by Orange Street, Brave New Girl and Wicked Wicked Pepperseed. ""She Don't Drink White Wine"" sold me on Orange Street instantly resulting in my buying several other CD's which feature them, including New Your Beat: Breaking and Entering 2."
3,great idea...,"Great idea but not sure if our new puppy responded to the heart beat or the heat. We forgot to turn off the heartbeat so of course of the battery died and we haven't replaced it. We also only used the warmer pouch once. Nevertheless, we do often find her sleeping on it in her crate like a pillow."
2,"Not much variety in ""Variety Pack""","I ordered this item so I could try out the many options Trojan offers. However, my order does not offer much variety. It only included of the most basic types of condoms : Lubed, Non-Lubed, Ribbed. I was very disappointed in the selection of condoms and will now be looking elsewhere for a variety."
1,George Burns & Gracie Allen Show video,This is a horrible product. The quality of the video is really bad. It looks like someone just recorded it off tv with awful reception. Save your money - do not buy this video.We are huge fans of this show and watch it on our own TV - thought we would like to have this in our video file - we should have just recorded it ourselves off our tv with good receiption.George Burns & Gracie Allen Show: Volumes 1 & 2 (Two-Disc Edition)
3,Not true to size,The ring is beautiful but not true to size. I wear size ten but 1/2 size larger would have been more comfortable in this design.
3,mesh ring,"I recieved the ring very quickly. It looks great. However, there is a broken piece of mesh which occured after shipment. It was not broken when I got it. It cannot be worn or it will scratch me. I was diligent in taking it off to wash up. I was gentle with it. I did not return it, but I do have to bring it somewhere to have it soddered. I feel I should have spent the money and gotten the ""Tiffany"" ring."
4,mesh ring,"it was difficult to get the sizing correct, but the ring is very lovely and I have gotten many complements on it."
1,Be aware with the picture at Amazon,"The image shown does not match with the real product: Is not a square bumper, is the typical adhesive stripe."
1,wrong color,Item arrived in different color just as described by the comment above.Its supposed to be black with chrome insert.They sent silver with chrome insert.I dont know whose fault is this but I dont want to go through the hassle of returning this item.I'll just paint this over but next time send the right color!!!
2,Not up to the previous volumes,"Am highly disappointed in this issue.Thought they would have a book like volumes I,II and III, with an assortment of truly great recipes. This is an entertainment book with recipes thrown in."
2,River Road Recipes IV,"The book did not contain enough recipes, which i was expecting! Too many frills and not enough substance. This was a very pretty book, but not very valuable as a cook book."
5,thoroughly enjoyable,"It's really too bad this book is out of print! If you are looking for a book on bibliophilia this is the one for you. The tone is light but the commentary is extremely meaningful. It is always enlightening to be privy to the reading lists of others, but Pickering's choices and rejections, with defenses and objections, are more germane to those of us with a literary bent than most. It is personal without being confessional, and intellectual without being political. It is an excellent starting point for building one's own serious, yet non-pretentious reading list."
2,Kept looking for my false teeth,"Very down home, not for the uninitiated.Hope to hear more but not at night alone in the dark"
5,Applachian Best,"My review is a ""little"" prejudiced since Dock Boggs was my great uncle but I think his music is the best combination of blues and folk around. He put all he had into his music and loved it. It will bring chills and good feelings to anyone who loves music for the soul done as he did! All his songs are good!"
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"What a great book!!! I read thru this book in 2 days.You will fall inlove with Trev Trevelyan as soon as you set eyes on him!!!The romance with Kate and Trev takes place slowly, so it is realistic. Her love for the Trevelyans and the hysterical mishaps with the children are endearing.I highly recommend you read this book. Or any book by Maureen McKade for that matter."
5,A great Sophomore album,Easily one of the best albums of 1998. The melding of musical styles combined with subject matter of major and minor import make this a treasure. This is the type of depth that Alanis Morrisette wish she could have.
2,"A major disappointment after ""Diary Of A Mod Housewife""","I had eagerly anticipated Amy's followup to the wonderful ""Diary Of A Mod Housewife"", but this is bitterly disappointing. On that first record, she balanced bohemianism and single motherhood with humor and passion. This time out, it comes across as whining. Hey, Amy, we're all getting older, and guess what? It's not so bad. Get over it! Even more disturbing, the stylistic wandering of the music suggests that she doesn't have the confidence in the songs to put them across without some production crutch. I liked the simple production style of ""Diary"" because it let her heartfelt songs speak for themselves. Get a new producer, Amy, and please try to find something new to say for the next one."
4,Big Eyes,"I kind of trashed Meltzer's ""Reading Jazz,"" so let me make it up here with a big thumbs up for a really fun collection. The poems in No Eyes are accessible and lyrical with a great feel for the music--they spread down the page like tasty sax tootles in a classic Young solo. I especially like how Meltzer balances the beauty of Lester's playing against the tragedy of his life. Snippets of song lyrics, conversation and Young's private slang weave through the poems to give a clever snapshot of the man behind the sax. And Meltzer's love for the music is clear from the downbeat. Big eyes for this one."
3,meh,"the album was ok, but not as great as i thought it would be. there were some songs i had never heard on the show, some good ones, and some mediocre. considering how good the soundtracks on the series actually are, i was a bit disappointed. but on the whole it's not too bad."
3,"Okay, but it's missing 2 must-have Scrubs songs","Scrubs is a great TV show, and the song selections on it are terrific, and so that makes this CD worth owning...But! BUT! BUT!! Two of the most memorable songs from the show are AWOL.ONE: Nil Lara's ""Fighting For My Love"" (From the ep ""My Drug Buddy"")Remember the first time JD and Eliot hooked up, and the great song that played?(""Now I'm standing next to you. I think I've changed my point of view."")TWO: The UNDERDOG theme (from the ep ""My Hero"")C'MON!! To me this is like the Dr Cox theme song. It's abscence is just about unforgivable."
4,Good and mellow,"I bought this CD for Colin Hay's ""Overkill"" (which is awesome) and hoped the rest would be good too. This albumn is pretty quality with a couple stand outs from Butthole Surfers and Eels, but over all it's a little too ""easy listening"" for me. Good to put on in the car, but no fast dancing."
5,Great compilation CD from a great show!,"I've always enjoyed the music from this show, and was so glad to see they made a CD. If you like the show and enjoy the music that is played during the show, then buy this CD -- you won't be disappointed."
2,There is coughing on the Hallelujah song,"I bought this album for one song, John Cale's Hallelujah, which is only available on the album. I did not realize that this was a live version, there is coughing in the background and a whistle during the first line which is my favorite part. I would not have bought this album if I would have known. What a waste, you think they could have edited that coughing out."
4,Quirky Soundtrack,"For those of you who watch Scrubs, you know how quirky the show is. This soundtrack completely encapsulates the character of this show. The music is one of the most defining aspects of the show and is always perfect for each episode. The only downfall to the soundtrack is that there is no episode to relate it to. The songs seem better within the storyline of each episode but is still a must-have for any Scrubs enthusiast!"
3,New Slang,"This CD will get 3 stars because of the inclusion of the songs by the Shins, eels, Guided by Voices and Hallelujah by John Cale. The rest is fine, but not super."
3,"It's okay... but there's no ""it all comes down to poo""",I'm a little dissapointed in this album as I was hoping that it would have some of the cast sung musical numbers. I guess I should have read the song list before I purchased. I can't help but feel like this album just doesn't evoke the emotion that the show does in me. It feels somewhat tangential to the show.
4,Great Music!,I love the show and the music of Scrubs... the CD did not disappoint! Well worth the purchase price.
2,Bought for John Cale's rendition of Hallelujah,"I had to buy the whole album to get his rendition because the song wasn't available for download as a single. People are coughing through the entire song which is more than annoying...I'm sure for fans of the show it's a great album, and I do like the rest of the songs. However just be warned, if you are buying it for John Cale - beware the coughers! It's awful! If I could have heard the entire track before hand, I would not have bought it."
3,Nice Folk Rock soundtrack,"The soundtrack has a lot of the memorable submotifs from the television series: a few rock, a few folk, a few in-between.I loved the music, particularly Colin Hay's ""Overkill"", but was disappointed that the disc was labeled an ""ECD"". Load the disc into your computer's CD-ROM drive and it takes your browser to the ""Enhanced Scrubs CD features on the Web"" website - the only elements of which are a printed notice that ""Enhanced Features are Coming Soon!"" and a link to the public ""Scrubs"" website; and that's about it."
4,A Decent CD,Any fan of alternitive music will love this cd. If you are a fan Of Scrubs than you will love this CD also. They could have put better music on it. But overall a decent CD. (Enhanced also)
4,review!!!!,"im a huge scrubs fan, but i became interested this soundtrack mainly 4 de theme song, i'm no superman. however it was reading the other reviews that people wrote which made me actually buy it. it is as was stated a really nice easy listening album,if your into the likes of jack johnson as i am its definitly for you. all the songs arent slow and similar sounding though which is great. also a few songs thrown in that came as a surprise when you listened because you would know it to hear but just have not recognised it by the name! in all its a really great cd, well worth the money!"
4,Good but not as good as fresh,"It's been a few years since I've had a KK donut, so when I saw these on Amazon I had to try it at least once. I corrosponded with the seller to be sure that I would get them as fresh as possible. By the time they arrived, they were a bit dry. However, about 10 seconds in the microwave makes them quite soft and good. But don't expect them to be as good as freshly made!"
5,AWESOME movie,"love jackie chan, i have been a fan of his for a very long time. I bought this product as a Christmas gift and the person loved it!"
4,Jackie's Best Film in Years!,This one of Jackie Chan's best movies in years!It is very intertaining and it has both action and comedy that you expect from a Jackie Chan film.The fight scenes and the costumes are good.The actor that plays the General is really good and him and Jackie Chan have great chemistry.It also has a good soundtrack.If your a fan of Jackie's music as well you will like Rape Flowers.The ending is surprising and I kinda wish it had a different outcome.Definitly a movie that you would want in your collection.
3,"Jackie Chan is Showing his Age, Little Big Soldier (Bluray + DVD Combo)","The quality of the actual blu-ray is great, but the story was kind of old and Jackie Chan just doesn't seem to have it any more. It looked like he was trying to hard to be funny and the action was not the high quality I personally expect from JC. That's why I gave it a three ***. Had I had the chance I would not buy it again, because the story and action was rather mundane."
4,Touching,"Far from playing the clown and other trade mark antic , this Jackie Chan film is acually touching , and ends on a melancholic existentialist human condition sequence not unlike Kurosawa's endings"
3,Little Big Soldier,"The movie was amusing, and showed how one man was determined to try and find peace, and live a quiet life. It also showed a different character type for Jackie Chan to play.Only problem, when I tried to set the English subtitles, the command was locked out. I might have to purchase another movie, from a more reliable source, to have the subtitles."
3,terrible ending and doesnt play on every blu ray player,"the movie was pretty good, nice mix of comedy and action. telling a story of how ancient china territories came together. the movie is centered around a general/ prince and a soldier/farmer (jackie chan) and their travels back to the farmers homeland. along the way back to the farmers homeland they are being tracked and hunted down by the generals brother who wants to kill him and take control their territory from his brother. the ending was lame, not going to say how it ends for those who havent seen it. but have to becareful when purchasing though, the dvd doesnt play on every player. it started on my computer for a little while but was glitchy and eventually stopped playing around 20 minutes into it. so i put it into the ps3 and it played fine on there. so there is a compatibitly issues with the dvd. might have to have a couple of blu ray players around if buying."
3,The ending blows.,"What happened to Jackie? Not only is he getting older, lately his movies are terrible. Does he need money? No. What's up with 1911 and what's up with this movie? Does he not want to leave his legacy behind?"
1,No English Subtitles,"Despite the promise of English subtitles on this version, the were locked out on my copy (see other review).Avoid this version if you want to understand what's going on in English."
3,EVERYTHING SEEMS LIFTED FROM OTHER FILMS...,"FROM ITS TITLE ON, this not-bad film takes a little something from everywhere. ""Little Big Man', a soldier hiding under fallen comrades, and on and on. Chinesemovie-making has come light years in the last decade (or so); Chan is still Chan, which makes the film worth watching; but overall, it seems somewhat dulled downby non-stop lifts from other films."
5,The Republic of Me (Tea),"This book has been an extremely usful resource to my company. Although my company also started small, Team 5 Technologies, it is now a large corperation. This book helped me understand more about giving the customer what they want, and putting myself in the customers shoes. After all, a company is only worth the value of it's products. With this is mind my good friends, read the book, Nick J. Frost - T5T"
3,The road to new business,"The book reveals the thoughts and processes the entrepreneur went through to put up a new business. One can see the hopes, excitement and anxiety as the entrepreneur prepares for the business. It's a good read for people who have a lot of questions about what it's like to create a business."
4,Need better packaging!,"Very pleased with the Norwegian flag license plate. My only disappointment was that, although it came in a padded envelope, it had a slight dent in it. I was able to straighten it out pretty well, but shouldn't have had to do even that. I would hope they could take more effort to see that the product arrives in perfect condition."
2,not convenient,you can't charge the player when you are watching the movie with this cable. the cable with 3.5mm jack would work better since you could use the dock to charge when watching movie
4,AUDIO / VIDEO CABLE FOR ZEN WORKS GREAT,IF YOU HAVE A HARD TIME LOCATING ACCESSORIES FOR YOUR ZEN. THIS IS THE PLACE TO FIND IT. THEY WORK JUST ASWELL AS THE ACCESSORIES OFFERED ON THE CREATIVE LABS WEBSITE & THEY ARE LESS EXPENSIVE.
5,Had all the things i need.,A good set of maintenance kit with all the parts needed for every area to keep the stove in good working order.
5,Completes the set for Hillerman readers.,A great gift for Tony Hillerman fans. Gives rereading the older books a new meaning.
3,Surpringly good,This was a surprisingly engaging rom-com. I guess its kind of hard to go wrong with Jeff Daniels and Lauren Graham.
3,Good story. Got better as it went on.,The characters were a good match. I always like both of them in whatever they do. Good lessons. That's all.
3,Just because your supposed to have the answers doesn't mean you do.,Fun little flick about a man who is supposed to have all the answers and the people that come into his life that allow him to admit that be doesn't.
3,Passable Late Night Fare,"I enjoyed the movie, but found the ending somewhat abrupt. The story moved along, and suddenly it seemed they had no good resolution or way to end."
1,just horrible,I don't usually take the time to write reviews but I wanted to help my fellow man and say this movie was terrible.
4,Just Watch IT,"I could get all heady and intellectual about this movie and write a long review...but honestly, who has the time for that?? A lot of people, thankfully. This is just a good movie....among so many bad ones in the theaters all the time now! I rarely go out to movies any more because very few of them are like this one. If you're looking for a simple good story with laughter and a little depth then just watch it. You won't be disappointed."
4,Feel good movie,Really enjoyed this movie. Definitely a glass of wine and a short flight type of entertainment. Makes the time pass in the most pleasant way.
3,It was ok.,"Love the actors in it, but plot a bit dry near the end. Not as romantic as I expected and a bit dramatic. I love drama, but not with these actors! Still ok."
2,Porr choice,Slow moving. Unnecessary use of foul language. Weak plot. Only a good movie if you are a Jeff Daniels fan.
2,Decent,Good ideas. Not executed well! Needed a rehauled ending. Characters acting was decent. The entire movie like many movies made in the last twenty years just needed more time spent developing a stronger story line.
4,If you like Jeff Daniels....,This is a naughty little film trying to say something. Quite predictable but the character development was good enough that I actually cared about the people. It's worth watching for sure.
4,Solid Believable Romantic Comedy,"I rate on the conservative side so 4 stars is a lot for me. This was a funny, sweet and best of all believable romantic comedy. Lauren Graham and Jeff Daniels have real chemistry. The plot and dialogue are well written, witty and original. I enjoyed it and I suggest that if you are a fan of romantic comedies this is one you should watch."
2,Snoozers,Boring and unconvincing. A dream cast's talent is flushed down the old Thomas Crapper. Characters do and say things no one would do in real life.
3,A Worthwhile Movie,"Like FAR too many American movies, this one is unnecessarily and repellantly profane. Hollywood just can't seem to understand that a realistic movie ordinarily does not require vile and repugnant language. With its language cleaned up, I'd give this movie another star. The writing is interesting and insightful; the characters are three-dimensional, and the acting is good. Regarding the transfer to disc, if the standard DVD is any good, don't waste your money on this Blu-ray. It looks to me like Hollywood is ripping us off on the majority of Blu-rays."
1,The Answer Man - couldn't play,We could not use this video because a Universal format was not sent. We live in australia so need Universal or Pal.
2,Ugh,This movie was slow and not too good. The previews and trailer were a lot more interesting than the movie.I love Lauren Graham and I think she just wasted her talent on this one.
1,did'nt work on my dvd,"This DVD didn't work for me as my DVD player wasn't able to play the DVD because it came from the USA,not happy at all with this purchase.the seller shouldn't of sold it to me when they knew it wouldn't work in the united kingdom."
2,much ado about nothing,Every character in this movie is a freak loser with more hang-ups than a coat rack. Not worth the $3.99 it cost to rent.
2,not good,This romantic comedy was low on both romance and comedy. I recommend watching this movie only to witness the perfect synergy of bad writing and horrible acting. Flop-flop-flopity-flop-flop.
3,Quirky little romantic comedy,"Enjoyed this for the quirky romantic comedy it is. Otherwise, there is nothing memorable about it. It kept me entertained throughout on a cold and dreary winter evening. That's all I was looking for last night."
2,Too Obvious,"The premise is good, but it is just not for me. I can see how others would enjoy the story line and I would, too if it weren't so predictable and so full of foul language."
3,I enjoyed it,It's a good lifetime movie. I love the actors in it and enjoyed it. I admit it is not a wow movie but it's one of those movies to sit on your couch and enjoy.
3,Hang in There,"My wife and I took a break from this one because the story did not start off as well as we would like and we both have trouble with gratuitous vulgarity. Fortunately when we picked up on it again, the vulgarity made more sense in the context of the character and the movie came through in the end with a story line that was reasonably credible and enjoyable for more reasons than one."
5,Chick Flick,"I read the synopsis for this movie and it sounded somewhat intriging so decided to try it. Luckily I'm a Prime member and this movie was FREE, which is always a good thing. I was surprisingly entertained by the story line and the acting was excellent. Character development was top notch. The boy who plays Alex was a good little actor and he shines in his role. I highly recommend this movie. Even though it's a 'chick flick' for the most part, it shows how we are all imperfect people stuggling to find our place in the world and how our lives are improved by our caring for other people. Enjoy!"
2,Story Line???,"This is one of those films where you tell yourself...""I know it's going to get better!""...and you keep watching. It never does!"
4,Feel-Good Movie,"It isn't the best movie ever. However, it made me feel good. I have been going through a lot of changes in life, and I connected with this movie. It reflects on death and how we can't understand everything that God puts us through.I highly recommend it!"
3,waiting for the epilogue,"This movie started very strong, I was riveted. The writing was smart, witty. However, at the end when the screen went blank, I kept thinking this can't be it, there should be another chapter. Where's the epilogue at the end of the book. The way it fast forwards and you find out really what happened. The ending was very short, abrupt, the story was so well played out...until the book store scene at the end. The negative ending experience aside, I did enjoy the movie and would watch it again."
2,Glad it was free,"I found this movie to be hard to engage with, the characters thin, the plot see-through. I'm glad, as a prime member, that I didn't pay for it... I would have been disappointed."
3,Almost great movie,"Jeff Daniels is really great, and this is a nice little movie... but not really a good movie. It is so close, but it is hard to really say what went wrong. I think the story was just not developed enough. I liked the main characters, but was lost a bit with the supporting characters (the book store owner)."
3,A fairy tale??,"Misanthropic writer meets good woman with young child. If that sounds at all familiar that's probably because well, it is.. you've have seen this before in As Good As It Gets. There is a lot of energy here but it lacks depth . Having said that, it was very funny writing and a decent story but I'm not a big Jeff Daniels fan. I think he's a hard sell as a romantic lead , there's just something not cuddly and faintly menacing about him."
3,medicore movie,chemistry is lacking movie is lackingonly watched because it was free and regret doing so.a waste of an hour and a half.
3,Slight But Touching,"I would not have seen this in the theater, and would probably have forgotten all about it by the time it was available for rent, but the opportunity to watch ""The Answer Man"" online near to its theatrical release date made it worthwhile. I was surprised to find the movie more touching than cloying, and the acting was top notch. I was also worried it would be too religious or New Age, but these were presented in a realistic and critical way. The comedy and romance were slight, but overall it was touching."
2,Hackneyed,"Not a good movie. Lifeless, cliched script. The actors, thanks to the bad writing, could only do a mediocre job. Was there a dog in it? I don't remember. It was supposed to be a feel-good movie, but it failed to hit the right notes, so I just felt annoyed with myself for wasting the time."
4,The Answer Man,"Good movie if you want to be entertained with a romantic story that as no violence and sex.Also if you are a Jeff Daniels fan, you will like this movie."
4,Radical Jewish Culture - Indeed :),"John Zorn has outdone himself with his ""Radical Jewish Culture"" series. This is a hilarious and good album of Marc Bolan covers by everyone from Arto Lindsay to Melvins, via Lloyd Cole and Gary Lucas. The covers are almost all very good, but rarely as good as the originals. The concept - MARC BOLAN: GREAT JEWISH MUSIC - is better than any other concept. It feels so good that this album exists."
1,Travesty,"Let me clarify that I'm a huge fan of experimental music--seriously. The Residents are one of my favorite bands of all time.But this mangled, mixed up mess is an absolute travesty. The flavor, essence, and sheer beauty of T Rex/Marc Bolan are completely lost. I suppose I should have realized what a hot mess it would be when I saw the cover, but I'm a big enough Bolan fan to give this a shot."
3,bits and pieces,"Talk about a stressful Christmas Eve for Santa's helpers! We did finally get the thing together, but keeping it together is another matter. Maybe these race tracks tend to come apart? In any case, it looks good and the boys were excited to see it when they got up on Christmas morning and they did play with it for awhile . . .after Mommy or Daddy put the cars back on the track and adjusted the railings. The bottom line is, make sure your child loves racecars and is willing to adjust it continuously, as it needs it. We did remove the loop and our sons were able to use it a bit more. Our eldest is 6 years old and takes good care of his toys but we did have to put this one back in the box for awhile . . ."
3,Found it emotionally flat,"At most three stars. Can't go with the other reviewers. I'm all for a rousing, full volume New World Symphony, and no doubt this rendition has its virtues, but seems that these chaps actually pound it flat. Emotional effect lost somewhere. Still clearly tops by me and something beyond is Fritz Reiner and The Chicago Symphony (RCA).... Also those essays Penquin includes with its liner material are pretty much a waste."
4,"A robust, exciting 'New World,' but not the best of Kertesz's cycle","I enjoyed the loopy Amazon review, but to my ears this is a fairly conventional Dvorak Sym. #9, done in Kertesz's characteristic style, with plenty of excitement, freshness, and robust attack. But if you listen to the Carnival Over. first, you hear that extra dash of spontaneity and inspiration lacking in the symphony. (Ditto the excellent Othello Over.) Kertesz does best with the Scherzo, taken hell-for-leather at the outset, and the first movement, which feels genuinely committed. I got very little from the thrice-familiar Largo, however, and the finale, while energetic, never quite builds to the exuberant climax it deamnds. I am eager to hear Kertesz's earlier version with the Vienna Phil. recommended so highly in a review below."
2,Super Cute but no white noise sound!,"The stuffed animal is super cute but it's not as practical as I had hoped. It has several noises and I thought one of them would be similar to ""white noise"" which is what I use at night to help my baby sleep. Not crazy about the sounds."
3,"cute, too quite and a choking hazard!","My toddler threw it accross the room and it landed on the hardwoods and the nob broke off. Thank goodness I was right there when it happened because my 6 month old could have gotten a hold of it and choked on it! It's the perfect choking size! I couldn't believe how easy it broke off. I wrote the company to let them know so hopefully they can change the design, I have not heard back from them.Other than it being a choking hazard, it's a cute stuffed animal...the sound machine is very quite, so probably not the best for white noise"
5,Puts baby right to sleep,"This is a staple now in our nursery. Baby LOVED this... I put it on while I am nursing him, and by the time he is done, he is sooooo sleepy! I leave it on for the 45 minute timer, and he has been sleeping through the night ever since!"
2,Waste of money,"I was given this at my baby shower in 2010. The sound machine never actually fit in the hole in the Sheep's back. Ever. The opening is too small. Despite this, we did use each of the two pieces individually. As a stuffed animal and a noise machine. My son is not particularly fond of stuffed animals but it does consistently sit in his crib. The noise machine is small and portable which is nice. But when my son was 6 months and we transitioned him to his crib in his room (as opposed to our bedroom) - we found an alarm clock with a soother mode far more useful as it never shuts off and he seemed to prefer that consistent background noise.I found it to be a total waste of money. The only reason I kept it and tried to make it work was because my grandmother gave it to me. Otherwise it would've promptly been sent back from whence it came."
2,Not loud enough,"The sleep sheep is soft and adorable, as well as easy to attach to the crib or pack n play. But it simply isn't loud enough. Newborns don't have very good hearing and my daughter doesn't even notice when we turn this on. With our first daughter, we had a regular sound machine and she would calm down as soon as we turned the volume up really high. The sleep sheep just isn't loud enough to make a difference to our little one when she is really fussy. My suggestion is to just go with a traditional sound machine."
2,Poor execution,"First of all, 3 of the 4 sound choices are useless. HEARTBEAT must be for baby aliens, `cause it's not even close to human and is not soothing at all. RAIN is just a 4-sec. clip very badly spliced so that you hear the splice more than the rain. Listening to a badly spliced tape repeat every 4 seconds is annoying, not soothing. The WHALE sounds might be great for whales who happen to live in a Haunted House, because that's what they sound like on this thing. The OCEAN sound IS soothing...until it stops 20 minutes later. The sound stopping abruptly wakes my baby up, which means I have to wake up every 20 minutes to keep it going! Can you tell I'm sleep deprived, and this thing isn't helping?I finally just put my Ipod on ""repeat all"" mode and let her listen to Mozart instead on the iHome."
2,Got a used product!,"When I opened the package, I was shocked to see it was a used product. The packaging was already opened, the battery pack was not sealed. I needed this item right away, so I couldn't return it, but I was very disappointed that this happened."
2,Did not work for my son,"This is a review with my son as a reference. Each baby is different.I was given this sheep before my baby arrived and I was very excited after reading the reviews for it online. Much to my disappointment, it did not work for my son since day 1. It still does not work after 4 months. He does not care for the sounds nor do I. It does not sound like nature to me, it sounds like a radio.He prefers soothing music which calms him down and puts him to sleep.This sheep has the vintage look/color to it and it is really soft though. If it is safety to play with(I am not sure, have not examined it carefully), it could be a nice stuff animal."
5,Get some Sleep!,"My home is so quiet at night, apart from random outside noise and my cats going nuts at various hours. In order to help my daughter sleep through this crazy times, this item helps create the soothing white noise that will help her stay asleep when I put her in her crib."
4,We use it even before baby :),"I really like the sheep - it's the cutest womb-sound making toy that I have seen (I didn't want a bear). I like that there are four different sounds and the rain one is really good. I think the womb sound could have been better / more realistic, thus the four stars. I highly recommend this product."
3,"Love the sleep sheep, timer doesn't work properly tho.",I bought the sheep when I was 5 mo pregnant to use at bedtime in hopes baby would hear it and sleep associate with the sound when she was born. Husband and I both grew accustomed to it and feel asleep to the rain sound each night. Only problem is the 45 min function doesn't work. Regardless of which setting it only plays for 23 minutes. I hate the hassle of repackaging and returning stuff so we've kept it. Now that baby is here the 45 min setting would really be helpful if it worked. I ordered two at once and gave one to a friend with a new little one. Hers worked just fine.
5,A Sleep Sheep in Every Crib!,Babies LOVE this sheep! Buy one for any new additions to your family or your friends' families and you cannot go wrong! This is the third one I've bought and all three babies adore their sheep. It makes a special shower gift or a great gift for tired new parents. And they are delivered fast.
5,Great Product,"This lamb is great to hang on the crib. It makes 4 different sounds that are soothing, and relaxing. It also works great for a background noise. Would definitely recommend."
3,I guess I'm alone in thinking this but...,"We weren't that impressed. Yes, the sheep is cute and it appears to be well made. However, the sound effects were lacking. The heartbeat sound wasn't that great and the whale sound effect was just plain freaky sounding. It creeped me out. I tried this sheep for two weeks but my son still doesn't like it. Now we just play a rain sound track on the ipod we put in his room. It works MUCH better. He likes the sound better and we can have it repeat the track as often as we want, unlike the sheep which turns itself off. Plus, no batteries are required for the ipod. I think this is more for parents who just want to buy something cute."
4,What Nana likes baby might not...,"I was convinced the Sleep Sheep would be ideal for my newborn granddaughter. It's cuddly, cute and produces great sounds that I found inviting. However, she wants no part of it! I'll try it again in a few months.Cloud b Sleep Sheep - Four Soothing Sounds From Nature"
2,"Good idea, TERRIBLE quality","I was surprised, given the rave reviews of this product, of the incredibly poor quality. I will start by saying my son seems to like this lamb and it is a great solution to having a white noise machine (which he uses at home) at daycare. But given that A) I have had this product for about 3 months, B) have washed it just twice, and C) it gets light use, just 1 nap/day at daycare, it is in AWFUL condition. Looks like it has been through a war. Just took it out of the washer and an ear has fallen off! The fleece is matted and the plastic netting foundation is showing in many small patches. So glad I didn't pay more expensive prices I have seen in stores."
3,Just buy a white noise machine,"I do love the sleep sheep, the noises are very soothing and help to block out my family's noise when the baby is sleeeping. However, it only plays for 45 mins (SO ANNOYING). Also, you're not supposed to put anything plush in baby's crib for the first year, technically, so really this is just a white noise machine that hangs on the exterior of our crib. I wish I had taken the 20 bucks and spent it on a nice white noise machine that would play all night and block out family noise for my son."
4,decent product - great customer service,"I was given the Sleep Sheep when my son was born, and initially I wasn't too impressed. He slept the same with or without it. However, right around 8 months, the boy became extremely distractible and would wake up to small changes in his environment unless deeply asleep. This is when the Sleep Sheep became a real workhorse - 20 minutes of white noise was enough to get him to that deeper sleep level. By the time it shut off, he was out like a light. We used it at every nap, and many bedtimes.However, after 4 months of solid use, the sound device kicked out. Wouldn't make any sound but static. It was very annoying. However, when I emailed the company who makes the Sheep, they agreed to send me a new noisemaker without any hassles. Since it has arrived, peace reigns once more. So, overall, 4 stars for concept, 3 stars for execution, but 5 stars for customer service."
1,Be Warned...,"We need noise because of the sounds outside my son's window, and because of household noises, which were waking him up prematurely. Well, this product's noise TIMES OUT. As if one only needs noise while they're GOING to sleep...my son's most sensitive time is toward the end of his nap, and with a noise machine that runs non-stop, his naps can be extended by up to 45 minutes! NEedless to say, this product did not do the trick and has been in the closet for 2 years since I figured that out. (To make matters worse, before I realized it timed out at 23 minutes, it would wake him UP when it stopped making the noise!! Ugh...) My suggestion is that you get a GOOD white noise machine that will run all night long...those not intended for babies seem to be the best quality, in my opinion."
2,Not a must have! -must have is a maketing ploy.,"I got his lamb and found out it's just another baby thing that will be seldom used. Babies don't really care about the ocean, whale or the rain sounds, they don't know what those sounds are! This lamb with sounds are more geared for adults who find them relaxing. It's a cuddly stuff toy, minus the velcro at the back. Good marketing though by making it sound like it's something every parents must have. I say not!"
2,Grandmother,I bought this sleep enhancer for a child of nearly two years. She was terrified by sounds coming from a stuffed toy. She is not one to be terrified and she is very intelligent. My take is this would be OK for an infant or an older child.
2,Does not work for me,I am having hard time training my six-month to sleep by herself. I am so desperate that I gave the sleep sheep a try. The sheep is cute. But the soothing sounds did not work at all.
2,Thanks for waking my kid up...,"I love the concept and look of the Sleep Sheep, but there are a couple of features that I don't care for. Firstly, the sheep is on a 25 or 45 minute timer (which may work for some kids) but I really need something that runs all night. My baby wakes up as soon as it goes off. Plus, the only sound that is continuous (like a whooshing, and the only I can stand listening to since he sleeps in our room) is the rain setting. (Mother's heartbeat is just creepy... not conceptually, just this particular version) The other sounds are obnoxious and distracting- especially the whales, though my husband likes them. I guess I should have just used my current alarm clock on rain setting all night. Lastly, it needs to be much louder! All that said, I do use it- and could see other families having no problems. At $30 or whatever, it is worth the ""gamble."""
2,"If its so great, why am I on my 4th one in 9 months?",Adorable and really helped the transition from rocking to sleep. But we use the heartbeat sound exclusively - and the 3rd one just died. I'm so disappointed.
3,needs continuous play option,"Baby falls asleep, but timer only has 23 or 45 minute options. Sleep sheep stops, baby starts. I getless sleep when we use it because I'm constantly getting up to turn it back on. Continuous play option would be great."
3,Sound Machine Doesn't Fit,"Am I the only one whose sound machine doesn't fit into the sheep? The stuffy is cute and the sounds are nice, but they are two separate pieces and the cut out where the machine is supposed to fit inside the sheep is too small! Maybe mine was defect.....?"
3,"Cute, not so practical","This is cute and convenient that it can be easily moved, but in hindsight I would have gone with a normal sound machine that plugs in and doesn't turn off after 45 minutes. My daughter wakes up to changes in noise and resetting this gets old. Also have to turn the knob to turn this off which is inconvenient when holding a baby, but its for baby so the batteries aren't easy to change, don't want to waste them."
3,Not as nice as I thought it would be,"I was looking everywhere for a stuffed animal to put in the crib that mimicked a mother's heartbeat. This one does have that feature, however it does not sound true to a real heartbeat. The rain and ocean sounds are nice, the whale sounds are like something from a scary movie though. I will probably not use it as much as I would have liked. Also, the fuzz comes off very easily on the lamb. It would not survive being washed or even spot cleaned very many times. It does look cute in the crib though. I will still continue to look for a better one and will send this back if I can find a new one in time."
5,Sleep sheep is great!!,The sleep sheep is a must for our new little boy. He always falls asleep peacefully to the rain noises. I was never a believer in soothers and white noise machines until this came along. Great product!!
3,"Cute, but flawed.","I was so excited about the adorable sleep sheep! But it was practically useless for us because of one major flaw: it only lasts for 40 minutes. Every time it would turn off, my baby would wake up screaming. I spent a couple of months trying to sneak back into her room to restart it before it turned off, often waking her in the process. If you have a light sleeping infant like I did, I recommend just getting a regular sound machine that plugs into the wall and can run all night long."
5,great baby shower gift,"I purchased this item as a shower gift for my daughter, when I took it out of the package and inserted the battery it was everything I had hoped it would be. I am very anxious for her to open it up and start using it."
5,Great for young babies,"I put this by the bassinet when I put my baby down for naps or for the night and it's awesome. It has 4 great settings: flowing water, ocean waves, mom's heartbeat, and whale songs. I love the mom's heasrtbeat for my son. It really soothes him and keeps him relaxed when I put him down. I woudl recommend this to anyone with an infant. It's a real lifesaver. I may have to by the travel size as well for when we visit family. It's a must have."
3,Music box too big for giraffe body,"The product is nice as a plush toy, but the music box that's supposed to go into it is quite a waste. The box, for one, is too big. In addition, the sounds themselves are not all soothing, some a little jarring to the ears even - and these certainly dont help my 20 month old sleep at night!"
3,A little tricky but adorable toy,"Once I figured out how to assemble the musical insert, this toy made for a great addition to my little boys' room. The noises/songs it plays are soothing and seem to help them get to sleep easier. My complaint is that the musical piece that goes inside the giraffe was next to impossible to figure out how to insert."
1,"Defective Giraffe, choking hazard","I just recieved this giraffe as a shower gift. The volume knob on the bottom without any pressure, popped off in my hand. Its the perfect choking size. Make sure to check yours, I was able to pop mine back on and off and it only seems to pop off when its at a specific volume.I will be returning mine, and I don't think I'll be getting another."
4,She loves it...,"The first 3 months the Sleep Sheep did not seem to make a huge difference. She seemed to be on her own schedule regardless of her surroundings. Since she turned 3 months old, now she is 1 year old, she loves it and it is a must have. The back is helpful now that she is one year she cannot turn it off as easily and fall asleep. I turn it on the ocean wave sound. I fall asleep to it too on the monitor. It is so soothing and nice--better than a CD player, snugglier and portable. It is helpful to time it to her nap and goodnight time. Now, we can't travel without it! I put it in the car on trips, etc. Actually, we had visitors the other day and my best friend fell asleep to the sleep sheep in our bed to the monitor that was still turned on from the night before during baby's nap time, my best friend seemed in a coma I could not wake her up! And she often claims she can never sleep. She loved it so much she wanted to take it home. It works for adults too. :)"
4,Super Cute & Cuddly however...,"I noticed the hair comes out rather easily... and with a baby that likes to grab and then put things in her mouth I am a bit leery keeping this in her reach. However, I think this product is a good value - the sounds are nice and it's a toy that actually comes with batteries - hooray!"
3,Great product except for major design flaw,"The Sleep Sheep is a great product, except for a huge design flaw. The buttons to turn the music on and off are on the back, which makes it difficult to reach them because the animal is meant to be strapped to a surface such as a crib or swing. You have to move it every time you turn the music on or off. **The on-the-go Sleep Sheep has the buttons on the side rather than the back, which is a perfect design. It has the same great features as the regular size but without the design flaw of button-location. It is just a little smaller in size. If you are interested in this product, I highly recommend you buy the on-the-go version to save yourself a great deal of frustration."
1,Sound Machine and Velcro Problems,"I was hoping for this to be an attachment object for my kids at night, but they (3 and 1.5 years) both can't keep their hands off the velcro and sound machine buttons. I had to remove the velcro lasso and take out the sound machine on the first night."
1,Horrible waste of money!,"Horribly crappy product! I don't know what all the hype is about cloudb products and I'm disappointed I bought into it! I expected a quality gund-like stuffed animal. Nope! Such a CHEAP stuffed animal. The soundmaker is supposed to fit in a hole in its back - but it doesn't fit at all! It's not meant for cribs, so where or why would you use it??? Absolute waste of money, I will be returning it!"
1,"dont have item yet,,","i still don't have this sheep.. not sure if it is lost or what not. i live overseas on a military base and sometime things get lost in shipment.. are you able to help me out??? leaving here soon, so i would really just want my money back.. sorry but i really need an answer.."
3,Unable to be accurate,Unable to comment and review the item accurately as this was bought as a gift for a newborn in the States and was delivered to her directly. I have not seen the item although the parents say the baby loves it.
2,Great idea!,Love this product! It's a must have. Too bad I did not discover it earlier. It's great white noise that I can put/take anywhere and lull my little one to sleep. I believe the timer is for 23 mins which most of the time is adequate for my baby to fall asleep.
3,I really wanted to love this.,"I really wanted to love the Cloud B Giraffe, but so far I think it's just ok. Here's my thoughts:Pros:-It cute and soft-The sounds are relaxing-There is a variety of sounds to choose from-Volume control-Convenient handle to attach it to a crib, stroller, etc.Cons:-The ""fur"" seems to come off easily, I'm not sure how long this product to stay looking nice-The buttons are very sensitive and turn on too easily-The automatic shut off is too short, my son wakes up when it shuts off...the company should have a choice to just leave it onSo far, it's not the answer to my babies sleep problems...but it is cute!"
5,good,"The effect is quite good, beyond your imaginationJust started to buy just like the sheep of appearance, but received tried, found that the effect is really beyond my imagination, baby every day to listen to the sound of the waves to sleep. This is worth to buy!"
5,Love the Sleep Sheep except..,"I love this! My daughter is 9 months old and has used this every day of her life! It was especially good for her while she was in the NICU for 2 months. Just recently the sound machine stopped working, but i contacted customer service at cloud b and they are sending me a new one :) highly recommend!"
2,Did not work for my child.,"You may want to try this sheep for yourself, but it did not work for my son. He is now almost 4 months old and he has not cared about this sheep and its sounds from day one. I have the soothing seahorse and aquarium soother and both of these put my child to sleep fast. I would recommend those products, but not the sleep sheep. What attracts him most is the light and he prefers songs to the sounds of the sheep. I give 2 stars to the sheep just because it is super cute and I think we can use it later as a toy. It is also very soft, so I think my son will eventually like it once he can hold things."
1,Poor quality--shorts out,"While it worked, it was alright. However, after about 2 months of use it shorted out and will not work now. Same story with our CloudB giraffe. I also hate the 45 minute shut off and wish it would play continuously as to not wake him up. Save your money and download an iPhone app or go to a white noise website on the computer."
5,Adorable!,"The Cloud B Gentle Giraffe is a great way to distract/soothe a fussy baby! It plays different sounds, and has a velcro strap to attach it to carseat or stroller. Highly recommend!"
5,Love it,This is probably one of the best good ways to put my kid to sleep.We are loving it so much that we are using all the time.
2,Great giraffe but seam tore,I was given this giraffe at my shower. I love it and was hoping my son would too. Within 2 weeks of use (just for music as my son is too young to interact with it) the seam has opened up and the leg is falling off. I don't know how this happened as it hasn't been used much. I feel like it was just not stitched well. I have contacted the company so I hope they will replace the giraffe.
4,Sheep,Very sweet and soft with soothing sounds. Still a bit large for 5 mo. old. Baby will love it more as time goes on.
4,Sleep time,I bought this for my 7 Month old Son. We had a bassinet that played similar sounds which helped him fall asleep. He loves the Sheep its portable for when we travel. It seems to be well made.
4,Absolutely excellent gift for baby showers!,This is my new baby shower gift! I think it is adorable and the sounds are very soothing.
3,cute but unrealistic sounds,"The sheep is very soft, cuddly, and cute! I did not think the sounds sounded very realistic~more mechanical than sounding like an actual heartbeat or ocean, although the rainstorm option does sound nice. Despite my disappointment in 3 of the 4 sounds, I decided to keep it anyway based on the rain sound and how soft and cute the sheep was."
5,Excellent Baby Sleep Aid,We've used the Cloud B Sleep Sheep since our baby was born. The product is well made and has lasted 7 months thus far on one set of batteries (used nightly). Initially we tried the white noise setting which worked well when he was just born. Most often we use the whale noises and he goes right to sleep (it's the same on both the Sleep Sheep and Sleep Sheep on the Go). The heartbeat setting was also good since it mimicked my heartbeat.
3,sleep lamb,"I was a bit disappointed because it was obvious that the package had been opened, there was no instruction booklet and the lamb looked a bit ""used"". I think I got a used item and was charged for a new item."
3,Sleep Sheep,"Grandson (15 mos) took little interest initially, but is now enjoying. The white noise generated seems to be soothing ro him. Whether or nor it induces sleep remains to be seen."
2,it's ok...,"It's kind of big and awkward. The sound machine part that's supposed to fit in the ""spine"" of the giraffe keeps peeping out, so it's kind of hard when the baby bring it to her face. I feel like it could fit in better."
1,"Good idea, but has a few flaws","The sheep is very cute as a stuffed animal, but we ended up taking out the sound machine portion because it was too hard to turn it on when it was in the sheep and attached to the crib. And since it only stays on for a max of 45 min we had to restart it a lot. In the end this was also not loud enough. Save your money, time and sanity and purchase a sound machine that runs continuously."
4,"Perfect, but for one thing...","We've used this nightly and during nap time every day since bringing my 8 week old home from the hospital. We love the different sound options and the volume control (we turn it up loud during naptime since it's noisier during the day). Even my husband will say, ""turn on the lamb"" when we get in the bed. My one complaint is that there is no continuous sound option so I find myself turning it back on in the middle of the night. Otherwise, it's a perfect product."
5,"Sweetest, Most Comforting Thing!","I saw this Sleep Sheep on the NBC television show, ""Chuck"", and it looked so cute that I had to get one. I received it within 2 days of ordering it and I'm so pleased with it! The material is so soft! The different sounds that you can choose to play are very soothing. I don't mind admitting that I keep this for myself for when I'm having trouble falling asleep at night. My kids are too old for this, so I win!"
4,Adorable but Finicky,"I recieved this as a gift and instantly fell in love with it. I registered for a Womb Bear but this is perfect because our nursery is Safari themed.The only problem I have had so far was getting the sound box in the back. After 20 minutes of turning it everywhich way and seriously contemplating cutting a hole in the liner, I finally got it in. The trick is to get it perfectly lined up and then push it straight in. In other words, don't try sliding the top in first, then the bottom or vice versa. Once in, the volume button is a little hard to get a hold of and twist but it's totally worth it for how darn cute it is!"
2,Fundamental FLAW,"FLAWED.As a number of other reviewers have noted, there exists a fundamental flaw in this product's execution: the sound _SUDDENLY_ cuts out after the timed period. This can abrogate any beneficial effects the soothing put-down sounds have had, raising your child from the state of sleep they managed to reach.All it needs is a min or two long volume fade down in order for this to be a great product, rather than the sadly missed mark that it is.I emailed them in the hopes they might forward on the device's plans such that we could do a quick DIY hack on it to introduce our own fader, but they didn't address the question, instead choosing to advertised future products. Disappointing.I like(d) it, but then have to be grumpy about it. Oh well. Perhaps it teaches our child to deal with the sudden removal of nice things, a bit like life, like expectations (ahem, case in point)."
4,Great but...,"I wish the timer could be set longer than 45 minutes as it sometimes wakes my baby up when it turns off. Other than that, she LOVES it."
4,Pretty good!,"Not too bad, soft and plush, but sounds are pretty muddy. Overall, it does it's job and gives our little once something cute to look at!"
3,"Good idea, better options out there","Fortunately my son doesn't wake when this shuts off but I could see that being a problem for many parents as it is an abrupt end to what was a constant sound. My son does love the Giraffe, more so than the sheep - makes different sounds but the only one like white noise is ocean waves, he will cuddle up next to it at night and fall asleep. It doesn't get very loud especially when the batteries get low but is enough to comfort my son."
4,It was a gift!,Larger than expected and a 'dirty' white color. Sound features were good. Probably would have passed if I had seen it first.
3,It's okay... but I wish it didn't shut off automatically,"For all of you sleep deprived parents out there, let me do you a favor and make one thing very clear: the Sleep Sheep does NOT come with a continuous operation option.If your kid is like mine and wakes up as soon as the noise machine turns off (which is about the worst thing in the world), then skip the Sleep Sheep and go for something with the option of running all night long. TheHoMedics SS-2000 Sound Spa Relaxation Sound Machine with 6 Nature Sounds, Silverworked well for me - it is cheaper than the Sleep Sheep, you can choose whether or not you want it to run all night or shut off after a certain amount of time and, as an added bonus, it comes with an A/C adapter."
2,"Great idea, cheap, cheap, cheap construction","Short and sweet, great concept, the sheep is cute, sounds are pretty good (although we stick to the ocean sound usually), but we have gone through 3 of these so far and are ready to return the last one and try something else. All bought from Target, everyone of them has malfunctioned within 2 months. We got an exchange for the first one that would only work intermittently after 1 month of use. The second sheep would not switch to the 45 minute mode. Returned it for another one....after 2 weeks it will shut off if it is bumped slightly.....ugh. What a POS product. Would it kill the manufacturer to make a quality product and just charge us $5 more? Just a waste of a great idea."
3,Good but not great,"My mom bought this for us as a shower gift. It's been nice to have but not essential. First of all the heart beat needs to be slightly quicker. Second, the jungle sounds are a little too stimulating for my little one. She likes them when she is awake but as far as playing them at night...it keeps her attention so then keeps her awake. The white noise one is the best one overall. It does have a couple of different settings but I wish it would let me play it continuously instead of having set limits. I know I would go through batteries fasster but let that be my choice."
4,"Cute, sound box mis fit","This little sheep is adorable, and super soft. The sounds it makes are pretty soothing, but the sound box doesn't fit in the slot in the back all that well. I tried for several minutes with little success, but my husband was able to make it fit better. You just have to put the bottom end in first. I love it so far, except for that! Our little one isn't here yet to test the sounds out on him, but will update the review when he does get here."
3,cloud b sleep sheep,"Overall I like the sleep sheep, its soft and loud enough for baby to hear, but not overly loud for everyone to hear. I think the product is a good purchase if your child will stay asleep even after the sounds shut off. i wish there was no timer option, for my daughter after the sound shuts off she woke because of the silence.i would recommend product if you just need sound to get to sleep, but not if you want to drown out noises in the home."
3,only 4 sounds,"I bought this because of other reviews, I wish I had just downloaded a cd of white noise...we take it in the car and strap around his crib rail, the rain is the most calming sound for assisting getting our son to sleep. My husband falls asleep before our son with this on."
5,Baby Shower Gift,I purchased this as a baby shower gift for our granddaughter as it was on the Amazon baby shower gift registry. Everyone who already has younger children oooooed and ahhhhed at the Sleep Sheep and said how much their infant children responded to it positively.
2,"Good, not great","This product would be perfect if it had a continuous setting. We use the 45 minute option exclusively. It helps our four week old get to sleep, but he always wakes up when the noise turns off. We have to wake up and push the button again for him to settle back down. I would buy something different with the option to stay on all night."
3,Its just ok,"I was so thrilled to get this in the mail. I attached it to my son's crib and it didn't stay attached well. The musical box is in its separate area in the back of the sheep (too bad they don't show the back of it in the pictures) and its not a tight fit. The sheep itself is cute, the sounds are just ok, but the way it was crafted could be better."
1,Died after 6 months,"I put this giraffe on my daughter's wish list, and she got it from her aunt. At first, it worked fine, and my daughter loved it. After 6 months of gentle use, it died. Although a nice idea, this toy does not last and is not worth the money."
2,Creepy sounds,"The soothing sounds from nature were really very creepy sounds, very ominous and fuzzy sounding which was unfortunate because it is really cute and soft. We returned the item anyway because the sounds were just not clear or soothing at all!"
5,great product,I bought this for my baby due in Jan. Then I decided to try it out with my 1 and 3 year olds at naptime. It worked! They were both very quiet the whole time which is very unusual for them. The same thing at bedtime. If this keeps up I'm going to have to buy a second one for the new baby!
5,Do you want/need your child to go to sleep easier? Then get this SLEEP SHEEP!!!,"My wife ordered this ""Sleep Sheep"" for our six month old daughter. Our daughter has been sleeping through the night starting at 6-8 weeks old. But when she is over tired at night, we just put her down in her crib with this sheep and within minutes she is calmed down and sleeping. We even find he cuddling with her new little sheep.Once she starts at the day care provider (in three weeks) we will purchase another one to help her take naps in the new environment!!!!If you buy this ""Sleep Sheep"" you will not regret it!!!"
5,Wonderful,The little giraffe is so cute & cuddly. The sounds are so soothing. I think my new grandbaby will love it!!!!!!!
3,"Good Product, some major flaws","I actually became pretty reliant on the white noise to soothe my newborn and keep her asleep. This is a nice product, but has some major flaws. First off the timer settings really are a disappointment, the longest you can set the device for is 45 mins - which is too short. Most newborns sleep cycles will be 45- 60 mins, meaning that at the 45 min mark they will come into a brief waking point. If the device shuts off then your baby can awake fully and get upset that the very noise which soothed them asleep is now gone. I love how the device is easily transported and attached to a crib, stroller, car seat or swing, but I sure wish it had more variable settings. I also think that the velcro is a poor fastener, its rough and doesn't look nice. It would be great if it came off entirely or had snaps instead of hook and loop. An otherwise great product, apart from these two pretty major design flaws."
1,terrible/broken,Great idea. Used it twice and then it broke. I tried replacing the batteries but it still didn't turn on unless I banged it on something and then it turned off 10 seconds later. Got it as a gift so I can't return it or I would.
5,Great Product,"My Mother-in-Law bought this sheep for my son when he was 4 weeks old, he's now almost 7 months, and we're still using it. He loves falling asleep to the ocean water and falling rain sounds. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to calm their baby or help them fall asleep."
5,Great!,"My baby loves the heartbeat sound. It makes him fall asleep immediately. The other sounds are lovely too and the sheep is adorable. It is not white, but a cream color that goes very well with any room decoration. I love it!"
4,I like it.,"I don't love it. At least not yet. It wish that it turned on easier. See when you turn it on, it stays on for 20 or so or 40 or so minutes, however long you set it for. Then it turns off. Ok, but later in the night when baby is a bit restless I wish i could just ""push a button"" or a leg or arm and have it turn on again, because turning the volume knob to off and then on again can make it fairly loud and wake baby.Other than that, it's great, the sounds are semi-realistic, soothing and calming. And the fur is super snugly soft!Overall, I'm glad I got it and should use it more than I have been."
3,Works ok,"This sheep works ok at getting him to fall asleep but not really at keeping him asleep very long. The product arrived with batteries that didn't work so we couldn't use it right away. I doubt I'd purchase it again, his mobile works just fine."
4,Nice toy,"This is a nice looking giraffe but the sounds could be better. They are not loud enough. Also, the volume control is not that easy to turn especially when you are half asleep at night. It is hard to grab."
4,I was very excited but.,"I received my package today and was very excited because it is a gift for my baby, the packaging was fine, when i try to hear the sounds from the unit did not continually thought were the batteries but it did not, anyway the toy is very nice and the overall purpose of Article"
4,heartbeat,the giraffe was cute and bigger then expected but the heartbeat does not sound realistic at all. I will give 4 stars because 90% of this product was exactly what i was looking for but once again the heartbeat sounds horrible. you should really try to fix that.
5,baby loves it! great product,Totally worth the money - not only is it cute but works wonderfully. Our baby loves the ocean surf sound... works like a charm - always soothes and puts her to sleep within minutes. Bonus - also works on the hubby!
5,Great infant sleep aid,"We bought this for our 8 month old for Christmas this year and have been using it hanging on her crib ever since. I'm not positive it has made a huge difference in her sleeping habits at night but it seems to be good for her naps. She seems to like it and will lay in her crib near the toy. I like the heartbeat, rain, and waves sound options but find the whales to be a bit creepy and not so relaxing so we don't use that one."
4,Great relaxing toy,"This is the one thing our 4 year old daughter wanted for Christmas this year. I hesitated to get it for her thinking it might be too babyish and because it receives mixed reviews. So far she loves it. We had no problem getting the sound box into the giraffe but the again I was prepared for it to be very difficult. The animal is soft and snuggly. She sleeps with it every night. It has been a nice alternative to listening to relaxing white noise music on her CD player. The thing that bothers me is you can clearly hear how the sounds ""cycle"" on each ""track"" although the sounds will play for 45 minutes it is about a 15 sec (or less) sound bit that cycles over and over. I find it annoying to hear the giraffe grunt every 15 seconds but our daughter hasn't picked up on it or at least it doesn't bother her."
4,Giraffe sound machine,"My grandaughter has had a sound machine to sleep with from birth. The noise filters out sounds which startle her awake. This giraffae is very cute and soft. She likes the african drums on when she is playing. Note: this is run on batteries, and shuts off after 45 minutes at the longes. Often a child will wake up when the sound stops. You will need a plug in machine that doesn't have a self shut off to keep this from happening. Her Mom loves it when she wants her to sleep in the car or to calm her when taking her bottle. I would buy this product again and the price is right."
3,Best thing for baby if it didn't die,"We had another night time toy for our baby girl and she hated it, so we tried the Gentle Giraffe and she ended up falling in love. We call it Buddy or ""her buddy"" and it goes everywhere she goes. About a week ago, the batteries started dying for the second time since we purchased this toy. No big deal. Got new batteries, switched them out. Easy enough. Wrong! Sometimes I have to turn the volume dial all the way off and back on in order for any of the buttons to play and when I do get it to play, there are times when it cuts off after a few minutes no matter if it's set to play for 23 minutes or 45. I'm really disappointed by this because this is our daughter's favorite thing and so we'll have to try to fix it or buy another one."
2,To Quiet,"I really really wanted this to help sooth my 6 month old to sleep, instead of running our vacuum. But it's just to quiet, the loudest setting seems to be the ocean....but they all are still to quiet. Another thing that I dont like is the 45 minute timer, in the event that my son would fall asleep with the Sheep, he would wake up as soon as it turned off. It would also be nice if they replaced that semi-creepy whale noise with a generic white noise. I wish I had saved the box to return it!"
3,Limited to 45 minutes - useless for night time,"I loved this item and if not for this one flaw it would definitely get 5 stars. The longest you can set the white noise machine is for 45 minutes! My son (and I hope yours too!) naps for longer than that to say nothing of his sleep overnight. I cannot imagine why they did not include a simple ""on"" setting that would play continuously until shut off. Their attempt at saving my batteries has severely curtailed the product's usefulness. If you want a white noise machine that will go all night, or at least until the end of your kid's nap, you will have to hold out until they release an ""all night giraffe"" or else find some other product. What a shame."
2,irritating,"Im very disappointed with this lamb. First of all, its much larger than I thought it would be and the noises it makes are nothing special. 3 of them have been out for years, everywhere and Ive even heard them done better. The 4th sound is very strange and I find it irratating. Of course, Im not a baby, so maybe that will make a difference. I bought it for my expecting granddaughter, but Im so embarrassed by it, I will keep it at my house and try it out. Hope it works."
5,great baby product!,"have been looking for one of these lambs for a very long time,very quick shipping and a great price! this was a present for our little dog, she loves lambs and the baby sounds will be soothing for her! this is a birthday present for our little dog! thanks"
4,"soft, sweet and can attach to anything...",Length:: 1:35 MinsThe adorable sleep sheep attaches to the side of baby's sleeping area and plays four soothing sounds.
5,Our little screamer loves him!,"I loved this when I saw it in a local maternity shop and registered for it. So much cuter than the sheep, I think. When we received it as a gift I couldn't believe how soft and adorable it is. The jungle sounds are different from most baby toys, and the womb sound is a bit creepy, but our little colicky baby is definitely soothed by the white noise(rainfall) sound. We named our giraffe George and he sleeps in the crib every night. We take him in the car with us too, especially because the car seat screaming is constant without it. I just found out about the ""on the go"" version, and would buy it immediately if I knew the actual size. My son is 10 weeks old and we had to change out the batteries once already, but we use it alot on the 45 min. setting. Changing the batteries is a piece of cake and the compartment is easy to take in and out. Get it if you are tired of teddy bears and sheep."
3,Cloub b Sleep Sheep,"Product works as described. Did not like the mother's heartbeat sound effect. Very loud, maybe best used on a cop TV show."
3,Not as soft as I hoped,"Especially the back needs to be made more smooth, hide the music box better and I hope the skin material is softer."
5,Works all the time,"I work as a babysitter for one-year-old twins. One of the girls has a sever problem with sleeping. Once you put her down in her crib, she would start wailing and crying and she could go on and on for the longest time. I found this in one of their boxes and discovered that it slowly lulls the crying baby to sleep. Our favorite is the OCEAN sound as it is so soothing it makes me sleepy as well. It is also a plus that it comes in a cute sheep design to cuddle with when they wake up!"
5,A MUST have for every new parent!,"If you are a new parent, you simply need the Sleep Sheep. It is the only way my 3rd child would sleep by himself during the 1st year. He is a great sleeper now at 2.5 without the Sleep Sheep - which is good because my 4th child uses it. Really, a must have!"
2,Good but not Great,I purchased this for my baby daughter to help with putting her to sleep. I HOPED that this would work. I had no luck with this and at times seemed to irritate her more than soothe her. Don't get me wrong works well and I've had no problems with the product just that this JUST DID NOT WORK FOR HER. Basically it was a shot in the dark when purchasing because you never know if something like this will help or hinder! Either way i now have an addition to my older daughter PILE of stuffed animals! After all is said and done if this is something your child responds to then this may work for you. GOOD LUCK!
4,Great but wish there was no timer.,My daughter loves the sleep sheep. It helps her fall and stay asleep. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish that there was an option to have it keep going. When it goes off she wakes up :(.
4,Great for crib at baby's daycare,"My daughter is addicted to white noise and (I decided) giraffes were here favorite animal. The daycare center won't allow us to play her white noise CD in her crib there so we bought this could B giraffe and attached it to her crib. The only sounds she uses is the white noise one (I think button 3) and it's worked great! The daycare ladies say that she always falls asleep facing the giraffe. She is used to napping in her crib at home with no noise except her white noise CD. Now that there are kids running around and making a lot of noise at daycare it was difficult for her to settle down and fall asleep. This giraffe has helped a lot! I gave it 4 stars, because the other noises are annoying. We only like the white noise one. The safari one is too upbeat and the heart beat is kind of annoying too. There is one other jungle sounding one that is OK. I wish it had more soothing sounds."
3,Not sure if the baby likes it but I do!,"I can't really tell yet if this helps my son sleep. However, since he sleeps in our room I am now addicted to the rain sound and need it playing to fall asleep myself! Minus two stars though for not having continuous mode or fade out! This has woken me up before and i have to reset it. I have tried other sound apps on my phone but the rain sound is never as good so I'm stuck with the sheep for now.."
2,Malfunctioning,"This item was purchased for my baby girl off of our registry. We liked it initially, but after five months of use the sound machine started to malfunction. The two sounds we used most often, showers and ocean, now only play for a second after pressing the button even though the timer is set for 45 minutes. We tried changing the batteries, but it didn't help. Now, a month and a half later, the other two sounds are going out too. We were not using the sheep an excessive amount, usually only 45 minutes at night time. Occasionally she would stir after 45 minutes and we would restart it.The sound machine is now useless and the sleep sheep is just a expensive stuffed animal. We've moved on to using a free white noise generator on the internet for bed time if she needs a little extra help falling asleep. I wouldn't recommend this sound machine. It is overpriced for something that only lasts a few months."
2,Sound Machine Too Low,"The lamb is very cute and cuddly and little bigger than expected but my main purpose for buying the lamb was the sound machine. The sound machine is horrible, it is way too low when inside the lamb. Not worth it."
1,THE WORST MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was the worst movie i have ever seen!!!EVER,i am so angry I wasted my money!I am really disappointed!I gave it one star because you HAD TO!It does not deserve ANY STARS!!!"
1,Change the photo,"The first photo when you open the full page for this item is a light blue, peace sign strap. (as of today August 25th, 2011) is the only one that shows up when ordering on the iphone app, so it is the only one my daughter saw. The strap that arrived is the rainbow Jimi one in the other pictures. I returned it and asked for a refund and was told I could only get a replacement. I told them which one I wanted and was assured they would send the right one overnight. Again, I got the rainbow Jimi H. Nothing against JH, but my daughter is into peace signs. Finally returned the second strap for a refund. They should update the picture to avoid this hassle."
3,Price jump!!,"I bought the first one through Amazon for less than 40 bucks. Evidently, the price has jumped a bit- Yo! Leaped beyong the realm of reasonable, frankly, for what one gets.This was a good buy at 39 dollars, but way too much at the current $68. it now goes for. Go for real ""furniture"" value, if you want to pay that kind of price."
5,Superb riveting read !,"What a superb book ! Tonika truly has an amazing gift. She gives us insights into Angels, unborn children, spirits, biblical occurences, amongst many other subjects. Through her experience, she helps us understand and believe there is more to life than what we see, in ways which have not been explained before and that make sense.Truly inspiring ! A great treat for any reader interested in the spiritual and the unknown."
3,Not as good as it could have been.,"Loved the Imax Film. Especialy the FMX. Shame 1/2 of the good tracks aren't on the CD. No P.O.D. No Foo Fighters, No Sum 41 etc. The saving grace being The Feeder track and Moby's.Maybe there was a copyright problem with some of the songs. Who knows.Oh, and it cost me [price]. Guess I should have shopped around a bit more.Hope the DvD comes out soon."
1,Incredibly Overpriced!,"$58.00 for a very basic trance compilation with tracks already published elsewhere?You're must be kidding, Amazon..."
3,Careful about software,"The hard drive works fine but about a month after I bought it, Iomega sent me an e-mail letting me know they would no longer be supporting the software that came with the hard drive. Their solution - I had to buy the new software for $30, no discounts, no apologies."
2,Ads are inaccurate--NO software for Macs,"One of the reasons I chose this model from the reviews in MacWorld was that everywhere I looked indicated that Dantz Retrospect for Macs came with the drive. It does not. NO software for Macs comes with it.Iomega customer service said they are not responsible for the ads Amazon, MacWorld and others are running. Retrospect does not come with it and they will do nothing about it. BUT another reviewer here said he got Retrospect, though he seemed to have trouble with it on this drive.Very disappointed in Iomega. Someone gave those specs to Amazon and other sellers. BEWARE"
2,BE VERY CAREFUL before you buy this,"Be careful. I've spent 4 hours in 'live chat' with their technical support to make this thing work. And it won't do what I need it to do. First, be careful -- it must be plugged directly into the wall socket(it won't work plugged into a power strip) and it needs a main USB port in the back of your computer unit (front, side, or alternate USB ports won't work -- less power to alternate USB ports they said). And the you have to download a 'PRO' version of the software hidden on their website in order to back-up your entire computer system. Be careful of folders within folders. Selecting individual files is very cumbersome and doesn't always capture the folders within folders. And, if you need to back-up another computer across a network -- this won't do it. According to Iomega tech support, Iomega doesn't have any product that backs up another computer over a network. Be careful. This is accurate -- but other printed things by Iomega don't pan out."
5,Music at its best.,"One of the best soundtracks ever. And when I say that I mean videogame or movie or anything else you can think of. If you haven't played the game then you don't know what you're missing. (It may be impossible to find by now.) This soundtrack is a must have either way if you're a fan of epic, hard hitting music."
4,The book that learns you how to bend,"If you are a beginning blues harp player, this is the book that you must have to learn how to bend. My bending has improved very much after reading and practising this book. Also a friend of mine uses the book and his bending is improving too."
5,my two sense,"I too feel compelled to write upon reading a prior review which said ""The Turkish government used its right to get in and saved the lives of thousands of Turks out there. Why did they only took one third of the island? Because at that time the Turk population was the one third of the population of Cyprus. What do you expect?""What do I expect? That land was my grandparent's village where they were born and raised. Explain to me why someone else is living illegally in my grandparent's house without ever compensating them for a penny of its worth. Regardless of that even, they hold that village dearly in their hearts as their home. It's sad that they are not welcome or allowed there because ""the turkish government used it's right to get in"" according to someone's view. Let's not all forget that there are individual human beings involved in this and their pain and suffering runs deep. Illegally occupying one's land and house does not seem like a ""right"" to me."
4,A very good book concerning about Cyprus issues,"This book by Brendan O'Malley and Ian Craig writes about the conspiracy on the Turkish Invasion on Cyprus. It also tells the involement of America. Overall, it was a good intersting book on the invasion of the Turks on the Cyprus Island."
2,Does't Cut It,"I purchased this book in Northern Cyprus and read it there. The conspiracy theory the authors try to promote is not at all convincing and, not only that, may even be insidiously deceiving. While they try to link the US and Turkey together in a conspiracy to secure Cyprus as a paradise of spying activity for the US during the cold war, the book seems to purposely downplay the role of Archbishop Makarios, the Orthodox Church and Grivas as the real generators of the ethnic cleansing of Turkish Cypriots that eventually did occur. Had not Turkey ""invaded"", the Turkish Cypriots would have been slaughtered. So if you look at Turkey's ""invasion"" as a liberation (or even somewhere in between), the notion of a conspiracy between the US and Turkey here, even though there were obvious alliances, does'nt even begin to hold water, as the authors are trying to suggest, as the cause of the Cyprus problem."
4,Conspiracy indeed,"The way history revolves around small nations, and island nations for that matter, reminds us of the way little orphans wander about in the cold streets in the winter, exposed to the elements of nature and the voracity of the beasts..."
5,Review of Dynamic Stretching and Kicking by Bill Wallace,Mr. Wallace is indeed a world champion and this book is more proof of this fact. I use the techniques that he so thoroughly teaches in this book and I notice a difference in my karate workouts. I feel more flexible and more confident in my abilities thanks to Sensei Wallaces' wisdom.
4,A Great Primer on the Wallace Method,"Bill Wallace, Full-contact Karate's most famous kicker, wrote this book as an introduction on his particular kicking method which revolves around three kicks: Roundhouse, side, and hook kicks. Wallace fouces his attention on the method and make-up of his system that made him a champion. The book dosn't try to be a book on sparring or fighting methods.2/3 of the book is devoted to warming up, stretching, and footwork exercises. This is helpful and concise - great for a begginer. The photos are well done and his movements and mechanics are clear and therefore, allows someone to easily copy Wallace's movements.The book's strength is its accessibilty and easy to learn format - which is what I believe Mr. Wallace is after. This book is not on karate or martial arts, but instead, a specific aspect of American karate: Wallace's kicking and strecthing method."
2,A little disapointed,"Wallace's book just demonstrates some basic and advanced stretching techniques but doesn't give you any routines to follow and how to put them together in your workout. This book is not an exhaustive book on stretching. At the end of the book, Bill gives some demonstrations on his kicking combo's which I liked and thats why I gave it 2 stars."
4,Good for beginners on stretching and kicks technics,"This book is a good introduction and a well prepared suplemment for those who are entering the world of martial arts. It will teach a series of stretching, strengthening, and kicking technics following a philosophy of patience, control, knowledge and perseverance which are very important elements to the beginners. Another important feature of the book is at the beginning where it tells you how to strecth avoiding injuries. One example is to avoid bouncing, which is a very common mistake commited by many sport instructors and Sensei alike."
3,Where is everything?,"This CD is absurdly short and incomplete. All the coolest pieces of music aren't here - what's up? There is space for 76 minutes of music on a CD, and it's not even half used up. There's a track that's only 42 seconds, for pete's sake! And most of the others are only a couple of minutes or less. The final track ends like it's cut off part way through.This is a weird selection, and I can't fathom it. Even Shrek had the decency to release two versions of its soundtrack: one of the score, one of the pop songs that were scattered through it, which made it geekily complete. I see no reason for at the least a single CD of a similar compilation of score and song.I am stunned. The music that IS here is worth 4 stars, while the music that is NOT here would bring it up to 5. Its absence, however, drags it down to 3 stars only."
1,Pointless,"Why have a soundtrack that has all of the songs people don't care about? Basically this cd has all the background music that you never notice and quite frankly don't care about. Most of you who want to buy this cd is the same reason why you would buy any other, because it has one or two (very rarely three) songs that you want to get. The song that you are probably looking for is when the three of them with the baby are walking to the peak (where they ride in the ice caves) togather. It's called ""Send Me On My Way"" by Rusted Root. Hope that helps"
2,Thanks,I would like to thank everyone for listing the song Send me on my way. I was specifically looking for this song and did expect it to be on the CD. So thank you all for looking out for the other people interested.
2,Ice Age Meltdown,"If you're looking for the lovely, quirky, upbeat numbers youheard in the film, this recording isn't the place to find them.All the impressive, inventive songs, reminiscent of the work in ""American Beauty"" are missing, and we are left with the orchestral and very incidental music only; it meets minimum standards for background music, period. Pity. Where's the beef?"
4,An unfortunate CD release,"While this 13-track original score is largely incomplete and (as many have commented) full of the more useless cues; stuff we could do without, there is a 34-track bootleg floating around. I don't know how to get a hold of it, but it's circulating through the internet, giving David Newman the true audio release he deserved for one of his best musical efforts."
2,Missing,"The song that ends the movie or is ""Send Me On My Way"" by Rusted Root. THAT is worth getting. Does anyone know what the other songs with singing are?"
2,it's ok....,"This product would work well if it weren't for my cup holder placement. they're just to the right of the E-brake and so when i'm shifting (a manual) it gets in the way. there is no hight adjustment or anything, so that's a major minus."
3,Not a lot here,"I originally was turned on to the Greenskeepers through a friend who heard the song ""Lotion."" It is a great song, a good beat and clever lyrics, with a morbid undertone. It is written from the point of view of ""Buffalo Bill"" in the movie ""Silence of the Lambs."" It is a dark and morbid song, and a great diversion from the ""American Idol"" pop music foisted upon the public as ""art."" The rest of the songs are electronica club music. There is one other okay song on the album, ""Man in the House."" It again has a good beat and good vocals, but has repititious lyrics. If it had two more songs just as good as the ones I mentioned, I would give it 4 stars. The only reason I gave it three was the gem, ""Lotion."""
1,don't waste your money,"I buy music because its got pleasant lyrics, catchy lyrics, a good beat, or maybe I have to have it because its by my favorite band. I don't buy for the artiste content.Pleetch wasn't for me. Lotion is the only decent song on the CD; its memorable and catchy but it can't make up for the rest. The other songs are weak and the lyrics forgettable. Imagine the phone book read to music, but very very quietly and without passion. That about sums up the rest of the songs. At one point I found myself wishing the volume on my player went to 11 so I could get some life out of this CD! Very disappointing.Save your money or buy something else."
5,Inspirational use of color and form. Unlocks creativity.,"I just purchased and read this book today. Kumiko Sudo's use of color and form is phenomenal. Her designs are kaleidoscopic, and may be challenging to create, but even if I never make one of her quilt block designs I will be affected by her choices of color, focus on the use of fabric and its design, and stories of how each design came about.I really recommend this book; it will definitely encourage you to think more about color and form as you choose fabrics for quilts."
4,Mesmiring Smooth Jazz With Live Rhythms,"When I first decided to buy an ""THIS IS ACID JAZZ"" compilation album, I didn't know what to think. I mean I own all 4 Jamiroquai albums, 4 Incognito albums & ""Shelter"" by Brand New Heavies. When I popped this in, my first reaction was ""After hours is right! This is way too slow."" But when the songs rolled along it was more like ""This has some chilled-out rhythms on it."" Memorable tracks include Yada Yada's ""Summer's End,"" which ironically is more ""Afternoon"" rather than ""After Hours"", and the most optimistic, upbeat track. Jimpster's ""Playtime"" was pretty smooth, Marschmellow's ""Waterfront"" had a hypnotizing foreign tinge to it, and 9 Lazy 9's ""Electric Lazyland"" was off the hook (shades of southern african american hip hop). Although, I still can't grasp the essence of this acid jazz genre, ""4"" persuaded me that it's pretty good. Get it if you're an acid jazz fan or if you just like smooth jazz sounding music with nice beats/rhythms."
4,turn the lights down low...,This disc is quite solid-worth buying just for the bass on the Jung song which would probably destroy my speakers if I didn't have Cerwin-Vega's. The Jimpster track is great too. Quite solid-as good as volumes three and 'Miles Away' (Vol. 5)Recommended.
4,Lots of fast memory with a CD along with.,This has worked very well in my Canon Rebel XT. I have not noticed a change in speed moving from the hard-disk 2 GB card but I always wondered when the hard drive would fail. I now use this as my first memory card and am happy with it.
5,Great product so far,"Since I received it, I have had no problems with it. Image quality is wonderful. Uploading to my computer, I have had no problems. It is more memory than I actually need, but you never know when I might need it for those special times."
2,Undersized 2Gig card,"I bought for 2-gigabyte EXTREME-III cards, because my application requied at least that much space. It turned out that the cards were undersized - only about 1.88 GB was available. I had to divert them to another application that only needed 1 GB and buy some 4 GB cards for the original application."
5,Fast CF Card,It works fine in both my Canon Digital Rebel and Canon 20D. I've used it with no problems with theSandisk Extreme USB 2.0 Reader (Retail Package).
3,Same speed as Ultra II for Rebel XTi,"I bought this card and already own the Ultra II card for my Canon Rebel XTi. There is no difference as far as camera speed goes between the two cards! It supposedly has a faster write/read speed than the Ultra II, but even when I upload pics from this compact flash card on my card reader to my computer, I did not notice any significant difference between this card's upload speed and the Ultra II's. So if you want to save some money and don't care about using your camera in extreme conditions, than you should just buy the Ultra II, particularly if you have a Rebel XTi."
4,FAST CARD,"This card is very fast it took 1:19 to receive 224mb file from my computer my x/d card took 1:52 to receive the same file, it took 2:27 to receive 344mb from the pc,my xd card took 4:45 for the same file, it is not at all 20mb per sec. It is made in china, however not a problem if it performs well , my x/d card buffers fast and pause my E510 in burst mode, with this card the camera does not stop at all. In raw mode the x/d card will not match, it makes the camera act like a point & shoot .You should not go without an extreme III as you will be disappointed when the action starts. Bottom line not 20mbs but does out perform all my current sd/xd/& cf cards when tested in equipment and card reader. Good value for money. Christopher Semi pro"
5,works great.,Quick and no problems whatever. You would likely be just fine with an ultra 2 unless you shoot 10 fps or in extreme conditions though.
4,Speedy CompactFlash,This has been a reliable flash disk. My Canon Rebel is able to crank out 12-15 mediumm resolution continuous exposures before the disk needs to break. It may even be the camera at that point that cannot transfer data fast enough.
5,Love this flash card...,I usually purchase Lexar cards for my 20D. The sandisk was a better price so I decided to try it. It is fast with its write speed. I can pop off a number of images without having to wait for it to write to the card. The image quality is excellent...I think that the colors may be a little more vibrant than the ones I have on the Lexar cards. I think that I am going to switch to Sandisk!
2,hit or miss - this died after a few months,"Seems that electronics are like light bulbs. Some last forever, some burn out almost instantly.This 2GB card died after a few months of light use. Indoors, air-conditioned studio. Used only 1/2 the time (alternating between two cards). Even on days it was used...maybe a few dozen pictures, cycled 2 or 3 times through the camera.Manufacturer honored the warranty, but we had to ship it to them first. So, we were out the use of a card for over two weeks.Ordered a long 5-meter USB cable and hung it off the tripod. We'll try keeping the card in the camera and see if it works any better."
5,"Reliable, fast.",Firing off multiple bursts on a 30D results in no interruptions in card writing; the camera can get over 220 RAW images on one card. Fantastic.
4,TESTED BY CAPTAIN KLUTZ,"Extreme is an appropriate name for this CF card. I've had this card for going on 3 years now and it's still going strong. Never had any problems with it. It's even survived two trips through the washing machine and still keeps on ticking! At this rate, I may never need another card. I would definitely purchase this product again."
5,Get to Know Benny Bailey,"Do yourself a favor. If you dig hip trumpet playing, especially in the best swing tradition, get this recording. I had heard about Benny Bailey, but had never actually heard him play. I couldn't believe what I missed. Here he sounds like a combination of Pops, Roy, Red Allen, and Warren Vache, if you can believe that. God rest his soul, he died in April. Here he does tunes mostly associated with Pops, but the band is great and the thing swings like mad. I only wish I had heard him playing sooner."
3,English words from Latin and Greek Elements,I wish it came with a key. It is difficult to consistently read the mind of the authors to determine what answers they are looking for.
1,Bad choice,I bought this bassinet. The pictures of it on the website are great but in reality it is anything but. The first one I received had a hinge broken on the bottom so the legs would not hold up. I asked for a replacement which was shipped promptly. The replacement was also defective. The sides of the bassinet are stapled to a plastic ring. However the 2nd one we received one side was not stapled essentially creating on opening on one side. Not safe to keep a baby in. Needless to say I requested a refund and shipped the 2nd one back also. Time to look for something else...
5,absolutely WONDERFUL bassinett,"I'm sorry the last reviewer had such a bad experience, but mine was WONDERFUL. It arrived with all the pieces, it was easy to assemble, and it's beautiful and sturdy. I highly recommend it."
2,King Missile was way better than King Missile III,"There are several songs on here that are good, but most are pretty bad. ""Gay/Not Gay"" could have been great, but by turning it into a child's swear fest, the band completely destroyed that idea. ""Failure"" and ""Monks"" are the best songs by far on this album. Almost everything else is so not-funny or not-clever that when the songs end, I'm asking myself, ""That's it? It's over, just like that? What a waste."" All the previous King Missile albums are keepers, but this one is pretty bad. So just try to listen to this album somehow before you buy it, especially if your expecting the same creativity, clever, funny, and insanely profound lyrics and music that are King Missile."
1,not so funny!,"this album is pathetic! john s hall, plainly and simply, isnot funny anymore. musically and lyrically,this album is notvery...umm...GOOD! the musicians seem talented enough, but the songs are very weak.the title, unfortunately, is very fitting.don't bother!"
2,Detachable CD,One star is for the clever packaging. The other is for the band. The rest of this cd is so bad it isn't funny! Vulgarity isn't shocking anymore so why continue on and on and on with it! Up my ass is a direct rip-off from Boogie up your Butt! from that black guy on Saturday Night Live! John Hall has a great voice but he desperately needs material! Don't be sucked in! Get Shockabilly instead!
3,Bought it as a gift...,"Would recommend guaging the seriousness of the recipient prior to purchase. It has been a terrific dust collecter...but for the price, that beats dumping $400 or more for the same!"
4,Works great,This trap works like it's supposed to. Arrived quickly. A little hard to set properly but no big deal.
1,Don't Buy This Trap,"Havahart 1081 trap, the large one (36x14x15 I think), did not work right out of the box. Trap could not be set. The catch mechanism did not work. Obviously, no one checked it before it was sent. Poor quality control. Havahart customer service was good but could not get it to work. They sent me a label, paid for return and returned all my money, including shipping. The vendor I bought it from was poor and would not honor their written guarantee for paid return for a defective product."
1,Very unhappy,This is nothing like my other havahart traps that actually work. Very poorly designed and the pressure plate does not work well. Four nights in a row of feeding racoons in the trap and not setting it off is pretty bad. Be careful ordering this one...read the other negative comments. I should have believed them more myself.
3,Some Raccoons can excape,"I've used this for over a year, and just today for the 2nd time a raccoon escaped. It pulled on the inside door until the clips/hinges at the top bent open and the door came loose. Previously a raccoon opened the clips/hinges with his teeth.Most of the time they get caught and stay, but for the price I paid for this I expect 100%.I called Havahart and they are shipping me six of those clips/hinges for free, so I'm pleased with that.The pieces I'm talking about are sheet metal bent into a hollow tube, and there are about 5 of them holding the back door (the one at an angle when it's closed) to the top of the bar that wraps around the cage."
4,A few cats later...,"Okay, so i purchased this Havart trap to capture the cats that the neighborhood lady ""cat feeder"" attracts. Nine cats later I can tell you that this trap keeps working. Well built and meant for larger animals as well (racoons). The trap is large and a bit heavy. If you're looking to capture just the neighborhood felines, I would suggest getting a slightly smaller trap."
2,Cheap & not sturdy,"I have a smaller cage by Havahart that is very sturdy, but this one was made out of cheap materials. The box said no assembly required, but door wasn't even attached to the cage and didn't have the pieces needed to attach it. I had to attach it with zip ties. I also had to reinforce the clips which hold the cage together, make adjustments to the piece that holds the door open & and alter the eye hook on the side because it has too much give. It took a lot of time to get it working and it still doesn't work every single time...too much money for something requiring so many adjustments."
1,these items all have defects,"returned first one ordered,second one had same defects,called havahart and was told all of these have the same defect"
2,Live Trap,Trap itself is ok but staples used to put cage together are too wimpy and had to be replaced by hog rings(which I had) specifically on trap door hinges and lock door...First animal I caught(my wife's Siamese cat-19 lbs and not fat) trashed the factory hinges and got out of the cage...No racoon would have been held either...Not sure the cage is worth the price...Have since seen some as cheap and cheaper that were better built...
1,Poorly Designed & Defective!,"Right out of the box this trap was a big headache. Poor instructions, very difficult to set, hair-trigger pressure plate (which causes it to shut with just a minor bump to the outside of the cage) and the poor craftsmanship (wire from uncut spring) makes it a little dangerous to the user. I have bought smaller Havahart's traps before but this was my first one for larger animals. I have always been happy with their small traps but this larger one needs a total REDESIGNED! Needless to say, I was very disappointed with Havahart 1081 and shipped it back the day after receiving it. The only remotely good I could say about my whole experience with it was that Amazon makes it easy to return and get a refund."
2,Havahart 1081,"This trap did the job of catching racoons after some modifications. The first racoon trashed the gate to escape by breaking it loose from the flimsey fasteners. The entire trap is put together with less than adequate tubular galvnized metal clips. Being uanble to buy a suitable replacement locally, I fashioned some heavy aluminum wire rings so supplement the existing clips at strategic locations. Also, the trip mehcanism at the gate is not made with sturdy wire and could cause future problems. I won't say don't buy this trap, unless you don't like the idea of beefing up some critical points."
4,Another wonderful Babar adventure!,"Babar is one of the most endearing characters in children's literature. This volume is a classic that belongs on any child's bookshelf. The story of Babar and Celeste's hot air balloon ride and subsequent adventures in interesting locales fascinates kids, while broadening their cultural horizons. Some mature themes that may disturb kids (war, cruel treatment by a circus ringmaster), but provide a change from the pastel bunny and kitty story genre. Thought provoking for kids mature enough to handle it."
4,Wonderful,"My daughter was given these books when she was a child and loved the pictures and the stories..so I bought them for a friend's 4 year old grand-son for his birthday. And even though he had so many of the new modern toys. He really loved the books and stories. His parents were excited, too, since they had the books as children. it was a sweet gift."
5,Where's the record?,"I had this book as a kid and absolutely loved it . Mine looked just like this one except I had a record (78rpm of course) that went with it. What ever happened to that record?I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere. I would like to find it. It had songs that I still remember after 70 years. (""winking, blinking, now I'm thinking what to do--Oh, I know""......) Am I the only person who remembers that record?"
1,Contains incredibly offensive pictures,"I loved the Babar books when I was little and my son is coming to love them, too. They have fun stories and a great use of vocabulary. I was excited when I found this book for a quarter in the discard sales rack of our local library. However, my happiness at purchasing it turned to dismayed shock when I read about Babar & his new wife encountering ""savages"" on their trip. The savages portrayed are offensively stereotyped Africans - big lips, sub-human, stupid leers on their faces, mindlessly violent... it's been a long time since I saw such blantant bigotry in a child's book. I trashed the book immediately. It's offensive enough that I can't believe it's still in print.Enjoy the other Babar books, but stay far away from this one if you don't want your child absorbing hurtful racial sterotypes."
5,A great voice comes of age.,"Her two previous solo efforts were very nice, but I wasn't expecting such a huge leap forward - what a great record! Great songs, interesting and varied backgrounds and styles, and really mature and terrific singing. Can't wait for more!"
5,Support a Great Canadian Rock Band!!!,"This is one of Canada's best exports. Crunching guitar riffs mixed with intricate female vocal harmonies and self-deprecating yet humourous lyrics. If you like other great Canadian bands like the Barenaked Ladies and Crash Test Dummies, these guys should please your palatte."
5,TPOH RULES!!!!!!!!,"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH I MISS THESE GUYS!!!! JUST GOT GOT MY COPY OF WHEN WE RULED! IT IS GREAT, THE NEW SONGS ARE ADDICTIVE BUT THAT'S JUST THE WAY MOE AND THE GANG HAVE ALWAYS BEEN, THANKS ALOT, JUST ANOTHER REMINDER OF HOW I'M ADDICTED TO UNDERDOGS, LET'S FACE IT , I STARTED LISTENING TO TPOH BECAUSE OF TODD RUNDGREN,THESE GUYS ARE PART GRUNGE PART, WELL I DON'T KNOW, 2 MINUTE MASTERSPIECES, HAVE ALL THE MELODIC HOOKS TODD EVER CREATED. THESE GUYS ROCK, I LOVE EM, PLEASE, 2 THINGS. A NEW ALBUM AND TAKE THE TOUR TO SOUTH FLORIDA. THANKS. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!"
3,Poor little rich girl can write,"It would be easy to dismiss this novel as the self-pitying ramblings of a poor little rich girl, but this one can write with assurance and even humour about the kind of events and personalities which most of us would barely believe. Oxenberg - daughter of Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia - fictionalises the horrors of what one supposes is her own dysfunctional childhood with the kind of cool eye which makes her revelations all the more shocking. Proof- if you needed any - that privilege is no defence against misery, loneliness or abuse."
1,Recycled failed book published yrs ago _only the cover has changed,"My Husband Ran Off with the Nanny and God Do I Miss HerBy Tracy DavisRoyal Blue, published years ago with miserable results, is the exact same to-the-word, tired, whiney novel as it was the first time around. Oe would hope the author might have matured over the years and realized the book was a failure -- instead of throwing a different cover and recycling the exact smae book.The novel is the typical a poor little rich girl story -- a thinly disguised attempt of the author to embarrass her family and misconstrue the facts. When a child is kicked out of 14 boarding schools, one has to wonder: is it the boarding schools or parents fault or does the child (ie author) have such a nasty, entitled, intolerrable personality that no one wanted her aroud? This child was spoiled and expected to fet what she wanted,A tiresome novel with the worn-out theme , i would say don't waste your money.I do not believe a new cover can save a novel."
5,The Funniest Show On Earth,"I am UK based and the popularity of this show in the UK is huge. Everyone has their own favourite character and the catchphrases are hilarious.Just a note to Amercian fans, why don't you try the Catherine Tate show. It is amazingly popular in the UK and is similar to Little Britian. Some would argue that it is even funnier....if that's possible. You will not be disappointed with The Catherine Tate show if you like Little Britain.....trust me."
3,Funny moments with a lack of innovation,"This series really should have been one of those that went down as a pinnacle of comedy.Unfortunately for the producers (and the viewers) they chose a very slim set of funny scenarios and then ran them into the ground until they were no longer appealing. When a viewer watches a brand new episode but can predict every character's lines and actions almost exactly, you are doing something wrong.I wish these guys had been able to break out of their rut and do something truly innovative.4/5 for content2/5 for originality-----3/5 overall"
4,Little Britain Season 1,"This is the 2nd time I have watched these great episodes. I really enjoy the characters Matt Lucas and David Williams developed & portray on the show. My favorites are: Vicky Pollard, Dr. Lawrence and Anne, Lou and Andy and last but not least Daffyd Thomas the only gay in the village."
2,Redundant and Vulgar,"A character-centered sketch show just doesn't work. Some of the performances are genuinely funny--the first couple times you see them, at least. But the same characters repeat the same catchphrases and act out the same scenes with each other in pretty much every episode. I can see why it was so popular when it was airing, but it doesn't work as DVDs.It takes a lot to offend me, but I think that some of the material crosses a line. There's more than one instance of blackface, and an entire sequence of scenes about a mother who pimps out her teenage daughter at a truck stop. I think I made it through most of discs 1 and 2, but was ill by the middle of episode 3.2.Even if there wasn't any offensive material, there's just no point here."
4,funny and rude,"I bought Little Britain for my grown son ,who loves them.I watched with him episodes and the team is clever,.I have to say they have a few stock characters they do,and after awhile ,that wore on me .Not my son ,he screamed with laughter all through ALL the episodes .You think I'm taking poetic license to make my point. I'm not .I'm still partially hearing impaired even though I retreated .They are clever and unique characters,but a bit rude at times.Not for the young"
5,Little Britain - the complete collection,It arrived on a timely basis and made my son very happy to receive it. He began telling us all about the show!
3,I love Little Britain but,...it gets better further into the seasons. This first complete series is good but the second is better. I love both of these actors and they really never disappoint.
4,funny british humor,I actually purchased this as a gift. It is a very funny British humor. If you like Benny Hill or Monty Python you will probably enjoy it. Its probably not for kids.
5,LITTLE BRITAIN COMPLETE SERIES,"LITTLE BRITAIN IS BY FAR THE FUNNIEST, MOST IMAGINATIVE, AND BRILLIANT COMEDY TO COME ALONG IN A VERY LONG TIME. THE CHARACTERS AND SKETCHES ARE WRITTEN WITH PERFECTION, AND WHEN HAVE YOU LAUGHED OUT LOUD LAST?SOCIALLY CHALLENGING, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT MATT LUCAS AND DAVID WILLIAMS WITH THE WIT INTENDED. THEY USE EVERY TABOO,EVERY WEAKNESS IN PEOPLE AND STIR IT UP INTO LOOKING AT FAULTS,IN THE FUNNIEST WAY POSSIBLE.DO YOU THINK I AM A FAN?"
4,Americans need this show on DVD!,"Little Britain is one of the best sketch comedy shows ever produced. In this age of boring SNL and simply awful Mad TV, we Americans need access to a well-acted, superbly-written series. If you happen to have a DVD drive that you don't mind switching to Region 2, then you should hop over to the Amazon UK site and order the UK DVD. If you don't, then shout very loudly in the direction of England until the BBC offices take notice and release it on Region 1."
5,A Well Done Comedy Show!,"I rate "" Little Britain"" up top with the ""Catherine Tate"" show. It is well done, as well a laugh riot.I love the travel agent lady; ""Computer says ""NO""! As well as the Diet lady.Each act & scene is funnier than the next. I give ""Little Britian"".... 5 stars !"
5,Great laugh! Wonderful off beat British Humor,Watched bits of this in London Last year and when i got back to the states i had to find it to see more!
4,Brilliant and funny!,"Though some of the skits are rather simple and sometimes predicatable, the execution is brilliant and funny. A must for anyone who loves British comedy."
1,Stumped by the great reviews,"We love Ali G, The (British) Office, Monty Python, and most lowbrow humor of any sort. Even if the laugh track hadn't drowned out most of what the characters were saying, it was just not funny. About as clever as a 70's US sitcom."
2,Not so great,"I like a lot of British humor, but this is not very good. It reminds me (a lot) of Mad TV, in that the jokes are obvious and lame--it lacks the subtlety, intelligence and wit of shows like Ali G or The Office. The humor is based on recurring characters who are not inherently funny, and the same jokes are repeated from episode to episode. I'm not sure what the other reviewers saw in this, but then again I don't know why people like Mad TV. This is really not worth buying."
3,Funny...but repetitive,"When I watched the first episode of 'Little Britain' I laughed out loud. The characters were hilarious and the sketch ideas were original and off-the-wall.Then came the second episode - same sketches, slight variation. Then the third - same thing. By the fourth, I knew exactly what to expect.Too bad, because other U.K. shows to which 'Little Britain' owes a debt of inspiration - 'The Fast Show' (aka 'Brilliant!') and 'The League of Gentlemen' - successfully managed to mine fresh comedy from recurring characters.Still, familiarity isn't such a bad thing. The show is consistently humorous -- just repetitively so."
1,Bad Shipping,"The product was fine, brand new and sealed like they said. But shipping took forever even though I purchased expedited shipping. It took longer than if I had used ground."
5,Fantastic!!!,These two men are outrageous and hilarious!!! I never miss an episode. So glad they're available now on DVD!
5,Classic,Simply marvellous. You will find yourself watching this over and over again. Can't wait for series 2.
5,Fantastic British Humour,"I first encountered the Little Britain series back in March during a visit to Newcastle. Once I started watching it I couldn't stop. My favourite characters are Marjorie Dawes and Ann although I love all the skits. It is a very different type of humour than Americans are used to but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was evening laughing out loud on my flight back when I watched a new episode on the airplane. I can't wait for it to be released in August, hopefully season 2 will be available soon!"
4,;0),Just finish the first season and I liked it love the concept and the characters both Matt and David are playing. The humor is good. OMG the skit with the friend coming over and hitting on and trying to cop a feel on the grandmother too funny. I love BBC America and always watch Graham Norton show basically I always see both David and Matt on his show and decided to see what there show is about..
5,Enduring classic,"This is one of the most stunning pieces of music I have ever listened to. Whenever I play this piece I drift inside, its very power reaches deep into my soul. Just when you think it can take your emotions no further it keeps on lifting them higher and higher till you are left emotionally strung out.If ever you think that life has no depth, no meaning just listen to this, with the lights off, whilst looking at the moonlit sky and everything changes.This has to be the best piece of classic music I have heard."
4,Not bad,"3 1/2 star recording. Even though overall it is a fairly well performed piece, it does not seem to capture 'the atmosphere' that is lacking - it sounds more like they're just performing in the piece rather than engrossing themselves IN the piece - moving along with it. Some sections are noticeably deficient in the quality of the performance but apart from that is is not that bad - probably JUST about worth the price it's selling at right now. The small details does need work on still - The quality of the recording is Very Good but not stunning. And I comment after having listened to more than 12 versions of the performance of Mozart's Requiem, including the ones completed by Sussmayer, Maunder etc."
1,The guy sells a different stuff. (Be careful!),"You may think that you could get a desk lamp described in the picture. But, it is not!The seller sells a totally different stuff in real. I ordered that, but got a small desk lamp. Because I am really tired of returning that I just got the stuff. But, I must say that potential purchasers should know this truth."
4,GOOD BOOK,"I bought this book to add to my other star and planet guide books. It is a very functional book for constellations and the night sky. It also has good information about Planets and Meteor Showers through 2014.I believe this would be a good book for beginners also. If you are new to night sky gazing it might take a little practice to place in the sky what's on the page but just remember to keep yourself oriented with a reference point in the sky. The book is as if you are looking at it over your head with the sky above it.The book gives good History and information on alot of the ""main"" constellations."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"I dunno. i love Carne, and i love the collaborative cinema of Carne-Prevert, but this one did not thrill me."
5,well chosen selection,"This book brings together the key writings of someone who is better known by one photograph than everything else about them. Hart has made a careful and thoughtful compendium of the writings that most reveal Ernesto Guevara's thinking, one that changed over the years but always held to its guiding principle: ""the real revolutionary is guided by strong feelings of love."" Both a good starter or introductory book, and one that can serve as a general reference."
4,Concise,"The author has successfully unpacked much of the myth surrounding the second World War in the Far East. An easy read, this book is comprehensive without being superfluous or redundant. Lots of illustrations, though it seems that both Wilmott and the editor have missed some categorical errors for the photos (i.e. erroneous ranks and names)."
5,Love,"Needed to get some good old school punk, and I am glad I have this CD! Go get it, if you like old school. While the days may be gone, the music still fits the bill these days. Good solid sound!!"
4,High School redux,"The first half of this album was originally released as ""Sound and Fury"" in 1982. The other half is from ""Something to Believe In"" and I'm not sure where the live tracks are from.This was one of my favorite albums in high school (early 80s) along with Battalion of Saints 'Second Coming', Nip Drivers 'Destroy Whitey', Bad Religion 'How Could Hell Be Any Worse', Misfits 'Walk Among Us', Minor Threat, etc."
4,good game 4 DOS,"<DOS GAME>if you like 3rd person military statagy that is you hire mercs to do a job, then you tell them were to walk when to shoot an when to patch up that last bullet they took--also you can have them sit out a day to upgrade there wepons or spend a day dressing there wounds. the more sectors you hold at the begnning of the next day is in relation to how much sap you can harvest from the trees--so the sap is equel to money, yes you may hire overnight guards to guard sectors, asumming you saved some funds while hiring mercs, each merc is unique, thats what make the old game soo fun--breakdown------------------------------------------------gamplay------------ 4.5sound------------ 3.0music midi---------- 4.0mercs personality 5.0replayablity---------3.5grafix---------------2.7 <old> nice for its time thoit's a slow realtime AND turn based game WOWTURN BASED YES BUT YOU HAVE A TIMMER THAT INDICATES WHEN THE DAY IS OVER OR THE SUN SETS thought i should clearify"
2,Kickboard,"Summer in Tucson can be brutally hot. Instead of going to my health club, I exercise once or twice a day in the pool. I thought a kickboard would be an added pool ""toy"" for my exercises. I don't thing so. The board is kind of useless or, maybe, I haven't figure out how to use it."
4,Loading,This is a great game. I only started playing last night and was up much later than I should have been. Getting up this morning to go to work was really difficult because all I could think about was what I was going to do in my little Sim world. I am a big fan of the original Sims and expansion packs. This one has so many more options it is going to take me quite some time to figure it all out. My only problem with this game is load time...some things take forever to load. I highly recommend this game. The Holiday stuff is fun. I am not sure if there would be more Holiday stuff to chose from if I paid extra for the Holiday stuff seperately. Someone told me that you might be able to get the missing stuff on the official Sims 2 web site. I will have to look into that.
1,disapointed,can not get it to interface with other expansion packs. Very basic. Should have been done as an expansion in itselfjeez...do not need 20 words to tell this...
5,Sims 2 Holiday Edition,"If you want to keep your sims in a festive mood, the season of xmas and all that you find through the holidays will be found in this holiday edition.I've never once regretted buying ANY of the Sims series from THE SIMS, to THE SIMS 2, and now THE SIMS 3.It is what you make of it. If you enjoy the sims, I'm sure you'll enjoy this as well."
1,need to one thing,"yes hi i need to now do i have to buy all the sims games to play the sims open for bussiness or just the sims holiday edition would be fine like they say i need the sim ,the sims2 special dvd edition to play the sims 2 holiday ed. what games do i really need to play?"
4,A great CD!,"My one-year-old little girl loves this CD. I love the fact that some of the songs are sung by the Disney characters. This CD has been a lifesaver on road trips. As soon as I play it, my little girl stops fussing! Overall, this is a great CD."
4,"Actually, not bad...","I have one and it was easy to assemble, it even has a ammo drawer at the bottom. Of course at this price you can't expect a fine piece of display furniture, but you just can't beat the price. NOTE: When I assembled the rack, I've omitted the board with deers picture, I think you won't need it either."
5,You get what you pay for.,"Easy to assemble. The seller treated me extremely well. Their customer service department is the best I've ever dealt with. Their CS rep Patty, should be commended for her caring and thoughtful handling of this sale and the follow-up requirements. There was a breakage in the first one delivered and she arranged for it to be picked up at their expense and let me know when it would be picked up. The second gun rack was delivered in perfect condition and its delivery was before the first one was expected to arrive. I would definitely recommend this seller to all of my friends. The rack is of a quality commensurate with the price and fulfills my expectations."
5,"The best advice on canoe tripping I,ve read.","This book gives the best advice for wilderness canoeists that I,ve read in my 28 yrs. of paddling. I.ve just met the author on a wilderness canoe trip in Maine and he mentioned wishing to make a few revisions and updates concerning environmental pollution. It's great to know that he and his wife are still running canoe trips in Maine. I recommend all his books to anyone interested in outdoor woodcraft, and the history of the Maine Woods."
5,motrocafe cd,One of the best Jazz albums ever. I have been listening to jazz (progressive) since I was 15 (1974) and I fell in love with strong jazz again after I've heard this album.Very well performed from every member of the band.
5,I agree,"Some push the music too much, some too little and it drags. Ashkenazy keeps it moving perfectly and perfectly balanced. I hear details which get lost in other famous conductor's conducting. I think famous conductors sometimes make it crash and bang just to ""sound"" exciting. But Ashkenazy is perfect - you hear many details like never before. Top recommendation."
3,Not exactly the best..,Chairs come bent. Table is sturdy and heavy though. But all the chairs wobble like it's nobody's business... Could of made a better chair. Plus the chairs are hard to assemble since the seats do not have any pre made holes...
4,Almost perfect,I gave only a 4 star because there is one angel you can not adjust it to and it is not described.I took a Dremel grinder and modified the pieces to fit the correct angel.Also there are only fixed positions you can adjust it to.Heavy duty and nice product though.I am using it for a Music-rack where I pre-wire the Mixer inputs of a Behringer mixer to a front mounted patchbay and the cable have to go to the rear. This is exactle the position what no connector on the market can do.
5,Blast From The Past,lol i remember goin to my local bookworld to by these cards when i was 9yr old i have all the movies it was so exciting going to the post office this morning and gettin the package and seeing the pokemon card pack in there brought back great memories this seller is great and the product is great
4,Quite good for 1940s radio broadcasts,"I was a little hesitant about buying this collection -- sometimes transcriptions of radio broadcasts from the 1940s can be a little less than stunning, in terms of audio quality.Listening to the sound samples provided by Amazon convinced me that this would be a good purchase, and indeed it was. The audio quality is, for the most part, quite good. Some of the tracks are easily as good as studio recordings of the era, while other contain minor distortion or noise in places. The recordings are remarkably free of hiss, also.And, of course, it's the fabulous Dinah Shore singing. She glides effortlessly through a wide variety of material here in her unique and flawless style. A must of the true Dinah Shore fan."
4,A Cookbook for the Distracted Quilter,"I don't think I'd be able to count how many times I've used this cookbook.This is my second copy, as the first one is almost illegible because of all the grease stains.The recipes are easy to follow and use ingredients that are most often right in my kitchen. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants homecooked meals without spending the day in the kitchen."
4,Great addition to my cookbook library,Already have the Christmas Quilters Cookbook and love it. Thought this would be a good addition. Lots of great everyday and company recipes so it will be used often.
4,Hopefully this is the right soundtrack,"First off, I'm basing this review on the soundtrack that came with the limited edition player's guide, so if i'm wrong, don't whine.Honestly, the two best tracks are the last two, which are reprises of two other songs from SC2. The first one has a very nice violin part, and the trumpet part is really high and has a really neat tone, so I like it. The second of the two tracks is a reprise of Hubris (track 11 or 12) arranged for piano. Hubris opens with a haunting violin solo which is nonexistent in the game from what i've heard while playing. But the reprise is a much quieter piece, while still being Hubris. Whoever plays the piano for that song gets five stars from me.Overall, the soundtrack is good, but some songs are very repetitive, but that's not uncommon in fighters' soundtracks, so the SC2 soundtrack gets a 4 of 5."

2,A SEVERE DISAPPOINTMENT FOR REAL '64 FAIR BUFFS,"I'd have to give this video a C minus- for anyone who cherishes the '64 World's Fair the way that I do, it's a severe disappointment. There were SO many sights and sounds to relive, they could have filled the entire video with glorified home movies and still photographs for 2 hours, and it would have satisfied fair buffs better than this. (Too much time was spent on the history of the fair's planning, interviews with fair attendees, etc..) Apparently, the ""filmakers"" were obsessed with only using actual ""moving film footage"" and had to hedge the rest with the interviews, etc. (Perhaps they should have taken a cue from Ken Burns, since there is a MOUNTAIN of still photographs from this memorable event that could have been used.) If you want to relive the fair, try to only rent this video if you can, and supplement it by finding old ""Viewmaster"" reels and collectible fair photo books- this video brings back a few memories, but not enough."
4,Great but incomplete,"A great documentary catching the essence of the fair. Living in Queens and visiting the park where the fair once was, but being too young to have attended left me curious about the 1964 events for years. This film satisfied most of my curiousity. The political background, the cronologic presentation, the highlights of the shows, and especially the interviews were insightful. This film would have been more complete with an extra chapter at the end showing what happened to the pavilions since. Maybe a future part two could include that. The DVD picture and sound quality is very good."
4,The 1964 World's Fair,"Despite the previous post, I find this DVD is a must-see for anyone who lived through the era of the 1964-65 World's Fair. Relive the nostalgia through newsclips, film and interviews. Several interesting things are brought to light - such as the little-remembered lobby against the fair. The footage (probably filmed in 8mm color) is not slick by today's standards, but still serves as a window to the past. The interviews are touching as just plain people relate their magical experiences at the fair during that bygone era. One kid actually lived in the park for several days until he was caught. If you visited the fair as a kid, you will find certain footage jogging pleasant memories long buried."
1,Disappointment,"The photography, both black and white as well as color was of a very poor quality to say the least. The content deviates from the purpose of purchasing the DVD. Much too much time is spent on waving crowds, people recalling childhood memories and so many trials and tribulations in starting and finishing the project. All of this could have been compressed and could have been more meaningful. I could not sit thru the complete film. All in all it was a big disappointment."
4,Great compost but hard to tumble,"This compost tumbler really works--compost is cooking fast, smells great and the tumbler is a lot tidier than our old open compost heap. The one drawback is that I have a lot of trouble turning it over (I'm 5'7"" with pretty good upper body strength); it's easy for my 6'3"" husband; we both think that I'm just a little short to get the leverage I need. Smaller and/or weaker gardeners may prefer a composter that's easier to rotate.But we'd buy this one again in a flash."
4,Perfectly easy to use,"I've had good success with this composter this season. At first, I put my kitchen trimmings in it, along with some leaves and stuff, but it didn't do much. Then I upped the ante ... I mowed the lawn with the grass catcher attachment, and got lots of green vegetation, and then I went to my local coffee shop and asked if they had any coffee grounds for gardeners available (lots of brown). You need both green and brown to make the compost start cooking! After a few days, with daily turnings, the composter was hot! Steam rose out of the stuff inside on the cooler spring mornings. Granted, for the rest of the summer, I had to put up with a lot of brown coffee liquid goo dripping out as I turned the thing, but no one said it wasn't going to be messy. So, all in all, it works great. I can't think of anything to complain about."
4,Tumbleweed composter,Easy assembly. Doesn't take up much yard space. Works great. Kinda hard to tumble when full.
5,Wonderful,I love this composter. I bought it with a city rebate and it cost absolutely nothing. I used to just throw the kitchen refuge out onto a pile of dry leaves - now all goes into the composter. I've been using it for 6 months and I'm really looking forward to emptying it this spring and putting all that soil into the yard. The material inside doesn't smell and it rotates so nicely. Just the right size.
4,"It whirls, it twirls, it stores rotting vegetable matter for future use","This was purchased as a gift for my parents and they are very happy with it. The construction is sturdy, the design is solid and assembly was easy. It comes completely as advertised, holding compost and allowing for regular rotation of said compost.I could see the barrel being hard to rotate when full, but hey, what are you going to do? Make compost weightless? I'm thinking you'd need some super expensive equipment and a team of scientists and engineers to install and maintain such an apparatus. If you don't have millions to spend on a space age composter, I recommend this model. It's a solid value."
4,A great alternative to the old fashion compost bins,I started out with an old fashion compost bin that you have to turn by hand. Well After I filled up the bin and realized that I needed another one I considered buying one that didn't require manual turning.This bin really does improve the composting because its so easy to rotate (and fun to rotate). Its pretty large but doesn't take up a lot of space since its vertical. Its very easy to assemble and seems sturdy enough (I've only had mine now for two months). I actually ordered a second one since I've filled this one up and still have plenty of leaves to compost.My only complaint is the price - I would have given this product five stars if it was a bit cheaper. The materials don't seem to be very expensive so I feel like I'm overpaying for the product. Other than that I do like it and would recommend it.
3,tumbleweed bin,I needed to replace my backyard compost tumbler after many years of use and wanted to try something easier on the back when cleaning out. I decided on the Tumbleweed because of the reviews and because it was made in Australia - similar to t havhe hot sun in Phoenix. My first Tumbleweed arrived with a cracked bin - I probably should have heeded that omen but Amazon was great -sent a replacement the next day. I have my doubts as to how well it will hold up in the hot sun. The plastic is thin...it is more difficult to turn than I thought it would be and I spilled compost on a spin when the lid came off...must have loosened using it to turn as there is nothing to grab on to. I will re-review after I have used it for a bit.........OK it is two summers later and the composter has held up much better than expected. I figured out how to turn it easier and make certain that the lid is tight. I don't have the expectation of quick turnover so it works for me.
3,Doesn't work well for composting household scraps,I live in a vegan household where we produce lots of vegetable and fruit scraps and thought this would make a good composter. I even bought two so we could fill one while the other cooks. I live in Arizona where there's little grass clippings or leaves to add to this so basically all that goes in the composter is vegetable and fruit scraps. If you read the directions that come with the unit they suggest filling the thing with 100% grass clippings! So even after six months of tumbling the one that's cooking I still just have a lumpy mess of vegetable scraps and not something that resembles compost. Other than that I'm happy with the quality of these units.
2,Don't wast your money,"I bought this tumbler about a year ago. I was very excited to get away from my compost pile and use the cleaner and ""easier"" tumbler method. Assembly of this product was nice and easy as it took 20 minutes tops. What I should have realized before buying the tumbleweed is the huge design flaw. You load the compost into the bottom of the bin and flip it every couple days...easier said than done. This thing is very heavy to rotate so my 11 year old son can't run out and flip it for me. When I rotate it, it is extremely heavy and you have to shake the tumbler to get the compost to move to the other end of the bin. It is really strenuous so I replaced it for another center-rotating model that is so much easier. Composting should not be so hard.You might as well drill a couple holes in a garbage can, put a lid on it and flip it over every other day. You will get the same thing for $10. I gave this two stars because it is quality, just poorly designed."
5,Love it!,"I ordered my composter on a Tuesday with ""Free Shipping"" from Amazon and received it the next day! I put it together myself and have been using it for about 3 weeks. Super easy to use and no smell at all. I feel much better knowing that nothing is going to waste in my kitchen as it goes into the tumbling composter (fruits and veggies, coffee grounds and egg shells)and preparing to go back to the earth. Love it!!"
2,Way Over Priced - Works way too slow,Started my composting in September - Now it is mid March and much has degraded - probably will see faster results with warmer weather.Way too expensive for a plastic trash can with slits on the top and bottom lids - on a metal stand. Should have cost no more than $75.00Do not buy!
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!,"We bought this as we wanted to turn our vegetable/yard waste into rich compost which would be good for our garden and yard and reduce the amount of trash going into the local landfill. We followed the directions and used leaves, grass clippings, coffee grinds, and vegetable peelings, rinds, etc., and faithfully turned it a few times a day. Even after letting it sit for weeks and eventually months (we started it in the summer, so it got plenty of heat and humidity), when we emptied it again a week ago, we could still see the small leaves; it hadn't turned into compost at all. After emptying it, we hosed it out and then donated it. If it can't produce compost after months, it isn't much use. This product should be a big ""Zero"", but that wasn't an option here. Our title says it all . . . Don't Waste Your Money!!"
1,Broke in just over a year,"Not durable. Plastic tabs broke on one end after a year of use, so it was a very expensive way to generate compost. Had this not happened I still wouldn't have bought another, as it was very hard to turn when partially filled."
5,This wrist rest is great,"I had a cloth wrist rest and it worked good but I noticed that dirt would build up on the cloth rest and I could not get it off. So i found on amazon this Fellowes Gel Crystal Keyboard Wrist Rest - Non-Skid - 19.31"" x 2.31"" x 0.94"" - Purple and it is great I can wipe it off when needed, AND MY SKIN DOES NOT STICK TO THE REST AT ALL, AND I MEEN AT ALL. and the color is also very pretty. I also bought the same color in the mouse wrist rest and could not be happer. they both work GREAT way better than cloth AND NO STICKING TO MY SKIN!!"
1,Terrible smell,"This keynoard rest has a terrible chemical smell -- so bad it made my eyes water. I'm told the smell fades ""in time"". What am I supposed to do until then??? Save your money, and take a pass on this one."
1,Thinner than specifications,"This product is listed as being 1.2"" thick, but it is only about 0.5"" thick. Fellowes must have changed the design in the last year or so because the product is much different from the spec, no matter who the seller. (Also tried buying this in Staples, with the same discrepancy). I bought this same product years ago, and at the time it was definitely over an inch thick and worked very well. This version of the product is too thin to support my wrists adequately with my keyboard height."
1,Burst after only 8 days of use.,This product burst open after only 8 days of use leaving nasty sticky gel oozing out of the bottom edge of the rest.Also know that the purple Fellows mouse wrist rest is nowhere near the same color if you are trying to match a set.
1,Doesn't work. Doesn't last.,"I found this wrist rest to be a bit too low and too hard the entire time I owned it, but the kicker is that it didn't even last 6 months before splitting at the edge and oozing its contents onto my desk. There is no reason to buy this product. Ever."
1,One star for False Advertisement,"I do not actually have this product, so I am not giving the product one star. I am simply giving this item one star because it is falsely advertised. The picture Amazon shows is of three products- the keyboard rest, the mouse rest and the wrist rest. Now, I assumed that since thats what they show, thats what I would get. Well I called amazon, they could not verify what I would actually get. Instead they gave me the number to the products manufacteror. They confirmed to me that it is one product only, the keyboard rest. So if thats what you are looking for, go ahead and order this item. But if you are looking for a set, keep looking!"
3,"Nice pendant, however.....","As the picture shows, you should definitely wear this on a chain. I attempted to put this on a black silk cord, and the opening on the pendant was not big enough for the cord's clasps to go through.The product itself was ok as far as workmanship goes, although it did appear a slightly cheap looking; even with that being said, if I had a silver chain, I would still wear it."
3,Disappointing,"There was nothing really wrong with this product as it did what it said it would do, provide a hidden storage compartment. However, that compartment was small and it seemed to me that it could have been designed better."
2,Not Happy,"The can looks nothing like the picture, the colors are wrong and the logo is sideways so it doesn't look like a real can, so that's pretty pointless. It's also dented right on the top. I've had different ones before that looked perfect so this one is definitely a disappointment."
2,ehhh,can came dented up and was smaller then i thought it was going to be.i also was shipped Grape..lol and not ice tea like the photo
1,Loved the idea but...,It broke 2nd time I used it. It was also solid so anyone picking it up would automatically know it was a decoy.
2,damaged,"I was really excited to receive this in the mail and when I finally did, it was damaged and banged up. There are dents in the can and I probably won't be able to make much use for it."
2,Dented,My can arrived fast but also dented at the top. The top is jagged like someone just ripped it off when cutting it. I wanted it as a gift but am embarrassed to give it like this plus it is not packaged .....just the can.Would not recommend.
2,Yoo,"Looks like a real can, but if knocked over will dent and break extremely easily. Also, you can tell its fake if you pick it up."
2,not perfect,"My can was dented around the top, also the UPC label is horrible to peel off now I need to buy some sticker remover to even use this. I regret this purchase."
5,a wonderful collection of calmer chopin pieces,"A while back I decided to purchase Ashkenazy's Complete Piano Works of Chopin. It is a wonderful collection, and Ashkenazy is one of the masters of Chopin. I thought this ten CD box set would be all of the Chopin I would need.Some friends recently bought me this two cd set, and it has proven to be an excellent gift. The pieces chosen for this collection are some of Chopin's calmer and more reflective works. Barenboim, Vasary, Juisada, Ugorski, and Luisada are fine pianists, and it is nice to have different interpretations of theses works. A good collection for close attention or casual listening.Highly recommended."
1,Big Disapointment,"This 2 CD set was very disappointing to me. The album is subtitled: The Essential Chopin Collection. If this was the essential Chopin, I wouldn't be listening to his music at all. Considering that most of the pianists were first rate, I expected a much broader selection. To my ear, they were mostly the sweeter, more popular pieces, appealing to more conservative tastes. Granted that they were lovely pieces, they didn't demonstrate the breadth of Chopin's unique musical genius. I was expecting his more fascinating and adventurous works as heard in many of the Etudes, Preludes and Nocturnes. I'll look more carefully next time."
5,Truly Essential,"Well, I thought that I had purchased all of the Chopin that I would ever want. Then I borrowed this CD set from our public library and found that I just had to own it. I read the previous reviews for ""Music of the Night"" and they are all telling the truth. It is the most satisfying, peaceful collection of Chopin that I've ever heard; perfect for relaxing, or as background while studying or working."
5,This was a Great book.,This was a real page turner. I am looking forward to reading more of Malynda H K's work.
1,Undead DVD pack,Disappointed did not know the movies are old black and white classic movies wanted newer movies that where in color.
5,Really Good Alternative Music,"I think I like their first album a little bit better, but this is still a fantastic album that just grows and grows on you. Really punchy drums and a good recording."
3,pros and cons,"good: built in velocity stack/funnel in neck, stop inside neck for proper mounting and extra surface area ontop of filter.bad: the mesh is bonded/painted on both sides of media, which also flakes off on the inside, into the engine. some of the wire mesh also comes out of the rubber base it is bonded into, running the risk of being sucked into engine. poor filtering, inside the neck of the filter builds up grime after about 5K miles."
5,Amazing,Rockwell Church is definatly one of the best groups out there. They not only have amazing tunes but also the most beautiful lyrics. This CD is really amazing - and listening to it you are in amazment of how awesome the music is. The last track - Doves Outside my door - is so beautful that the first time I heard it I hardly could talk. Seriously this is one of the greatest groups of all time. BUY THIS CD!! Buy all their other cds! Visit the web site. Get to know this group before they blow up and are huge - beasue they really are amazing!!
4,Through The Fall,This is a great cd. Mix between pearl jam and Vertical horizon that blends wonderfully
5,Very helpful insights.,"Having previously read Rainer's, Breakout Churches, I was looking forward to Surprising Insights, but it was better than I thought. Drawing from the experience of people who recently rejoined a church or as adults began attending church for the first time, he was able to open up and clarify what drew them in and what helped them to stay. Rather than theory or ideas based on people who are not yet in the church, this strategy offers perspectives that have some meat. I was surprised at some of the conclusions and I believe anyone who reads will be both surprised and energized by what is shared."
4,Worth reading if you are serious about evangelism,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. It appealed to me because I am an engineer, and the book contains actual data, not just opinions and theories. The author interviewed hundreds of people who had been unchurched, but then became dedicated church members, and tabulated the things that were important (and unimportant) in their decision to join a specific church. As the title suggests, some of the findings were surprising, at least to me. For example, contrary to what I would have expected, folks who had not been church members were largely looking for a church which preached and held to a definite doctrine, and was not wishy-washy about what they believed. However, the denominational name was quite unimportant, as long as the church met other requirements. If you are looking to understand what appeals to the unchurched, this is a good resource."
1,Ho-hum,"Unfortunately when they said ""Goodbye"" they didn't mean it to be taken literally. Major disappointment."
5,A must have for Def Leppard fans!,"The extra songs make it worth every penny. Def Leppard is like a fine wine, they get better with age. The boys are still in town! Also, there is a different picture of the band on the inside cover. WOW! Check it out!"
3,A little disapointed,"I was so excited to get this one of a kind import cd of Def Leppard and found that after I got it, I paid more than I felt it was worth. The music was good... but the song lyrics were weak as well as the variety (there were only 5 tracks). As a long time DL fan... In my opinion, I didn't feel the CD was worth the price."
2,Not what I expected,The left boot had an issue with the buckle. It caused irritation on my leg. I had to send itBack
5,Wonderful and easy!,"I bought this book based on the other reviews, and because over the years I have enjoyed baking with the holiday season baking magazines put out by Better Homes & Gardens. I have had this book about two weeks and have made the Pecan Bars and the Banana Bars. I took the Pecan Bars to a party and within 2 minutes of putting the cookie platter down I had three people ask for the recipe. I made the banana bars yesterday, and thought that I had died and gone to heaven. They are so rich and wonderful especially with the browned butter frosting. I know that I am going to find all kinds of favorites in this book, and that I will have lots of fun baking new things!"
5,Sonic Alert SBD375ss Sonic Boom Dual Alarm Vibrating Alarm Clock,The Sonic Alert SBD 375sss vibrating alarm is the only alarm clock that will wake me with my hearing aids removed. The 'buzz' feature is not loud enough to wake me from a deep sleep but the vibrating feature really works!
5,I don't wanna get up!,"I am a shift working, life loving, aint got no time to sleep kind of guy. Sooo, getting up can be hard to do. I bought this alarm clock for my wife and I. You can sum up my review in two words... IT WORKS!!!! Enough said :0))"
2,Poor design and construction,"The first one I got was defective and the numbers did not fully light, so I exchanged it. The next one worked. That is, it met all the claims in the specs, but very poorly. Construction was flimsy. The buttons we small, including the snooze alram. This made it very hard to turn off the alarm. The volume of the alarm could be set higher or lower, but the control was so easy to move by mistake, you could turn the alarm to almost no volume without even knowing it. The alarm was a very unusual high pitched tone. Although you could adjust the tone, this control had minimal effect and the alarm remained unusual and high pitched."
3,Still not loud enough,"I must be a hard sleeper; this clock is still not loud enough to wake me up. Thank God its got the vibrating pad.Likes: The big display, vibrating pad and the overall size. You can even very the volume and how fast it beepsDislikes: Cost, the buttons I find them to be a little hard to hit with out moving the clock. The clock gets warm when the display is on high.I have this clock above my head and the vibrating pad between the bed and the pillows. Because disk vibrates against the wood of the bed it makes more noise than the clock does.Knowing what I know now I would not buy this clock again."
1,Was nothing Special...Regular alarm clock with a bed shaker,I was really hoping to get something special..All I got was a plain Alarm Clock...I thought it was going to be super load..The random alarm clock I bought at Wal-Mart is louder than this thing...Not worth the extra money...It is about as loud as the alarm on my phone...
3,Not as loud as claimed,"We had expected the alarm on the Sonic Alert to be extremely loud but it was not any louder than other alarms we have used. However, the vibrator works great when placed in an empty tin can on the bedside table."
1,Never recieved Item and billed for it,I never recieved the item. I tried to contact seller but never heard anything back. I do not understand why I have not recieved the alarm I ordered in Sept.
5,This will wake you up!,"My 19 yr old daughter can sleep through most alarm clocks! Well, that has changed. After receiving this clock, she has not been late for college or work. Finally! The only complaint is that it also wakes up her roommates."
1,Does not do the job,"People think this is loud? It does sound different, and it is not quiet, but it is not really all that loud. Between the bed shaker and the audio alert, it does get me out of bed.But then the problem: The 'off' button is the same size and is easier to locate than the 'snooze' button. So, if you are at all bleary eyed and stupid in the morning like I am, you are far more likely to turn it off than you are to hit snooze. I bet the other reviewer who said it sometimes does not work right was just turning it off in his sleep rather than hitting snooze. In my book this is a fatal design flaw.Nice big display; But it just does not do the job."
3,Sonic Alert SBD375ss Alarm Clock,"I purchased the Sonic Alert SBD375ss Alarm Clock because it claimed to have a 24 hour format display. Unfortunately, it turns out that the 24 hour format display only works correctly with 50 Hz power, not the 60 Hz power we have in the United States. I did open the clock up to see if it was possible to change this, but the clock chip that is used (Sanyo LM8562) will only support the 24 hour format when in the 50 Hz mode. Other than this problem, the clock is very nice. The large green display is easy to read and the alarm can be very loud. I have not tried the shaker yet.I have only had the clock for about one month. I gave it three stars because the 24 hout display format is unusable here in the United States."
4,Should have bought this years ago,"Firstly, this alarm clock is not so loud that you will go deaf. I put the buzzer thing in my pillowcase but not on the side I lay on. It usually startles me awake...which is perfect for me! If you have trouble waking up, give this alarm clock a go!"
4,Great Product,"I have recently purchased this clock and I have only used the vibration alarm, but I love it. I think it works great and love the dual alarms. The only bad thing I can say is that it is really bright even on the dim setting. I would recommend this clock even if you do not have a hearing problem."
3,good for waking you up,"I have the portable model for travel and the regular model for home. I bought initially for the shaker so I dont have to wakeup my companion if i have weird alarm times. I dont even use beeper and honestly do not know how someone would not be waken by just shaker. The shortcoming I see, is the limit to alarms. They have 1 model with 2 alarms, most models have just 1, but there should be a model with more than 2 alarms for persons with medical situations, which I think was why it was originally created."
5,Unforgettable voice!,"Johnny Maestro's music is magical, he has the voice of an angel. His music brings back wonderful memories. There will never be another Maestro."
4,Johnny Maestro in total control!,"Out of all the 50's & early 60's Rock & Rollers, Johnny Maestro has remained the one singer who sounds exactly the same as he did back then. It's hard to believe but if you close your eyes, you can't tell it's a 21st Century concert. The BB harmonies are right on as well. The only complaint, and why I did not give this 5 stars, is the interviews that pop up between songs. It would have been nice to see the concert with no interruptions. But, by all means, get this. You won't be disappointed."
4,Worth owning,"Great song selection. Would've given 5 stars if it had been widescreen, 5.1 sound AND they hadn't mixed the interviews in with the live songs. The interviews were informative but they should've had an option to listen to them after the concert, not mixed into it."
4,The US Arms Export Complex,"This book is a must read for anyone studying modern US military history and especially US weapons procurement policy. This is not a ""shoot em up"" book, but a well detailed account of US weapons export policy and what the US actually exports to its clients. The question is often raised as to what happens to all the weapon systems when they're retired. This book answers that question as well as other questions about contemporary US military weapons procurement. Anyone who is begining a career as a procurement specialist in and around the US military must read this book."
3,A good book but not a great book...,"This is a good book and it reads pretty well. The story often deviates from Hughes (especially in the second half) to go into stories about many of the pilots and engineers that worked with Hughes. This isn't unreasonable because these are the people that the author had access too and they also have interesting lives. However, I feel that this distracts from the Hughes story and I suspect is done to fill in the many gaps when no one knew what Hughes was actually doing. If you are interested in the aviator side of Hughes I feel its worth the purchase."
2,disapointed,"The unit came in a box which could have been better packed. The door does not close tight so that the sand blows all over the floor. It worked for about 2 hours then the gun started not work except when pulling the trigger halfway. Which reduced the air flow. I still have to do three more items to sand, so I'm in the middle of fixing the gun and the cabinet. Next time I'll buy a more expenceive unit. You get what you pay for."
2,why the fuss?,"I cannot understand why the fuss over this book. The text is disappointing: repetitive, opinionated, insubstantial, more like desultory notes than anything else. The images are all black-and-white and poorly reproduced, and again repetitive and disconnected.There is too much horror in it. Bataille associates violence, horror, terror, pain, cruelty, with eroticism, madness, ecstasy, the sacred. Perhaps intense cultivation of pleasure creates a corresponding accumulative cultivation of pain. Why should this be so? I don't know except that we have what it takes to explore and we can explore in all and any direction. It's as simple as that.It's possible to write books and essays that are lucid and meaningful and it's possible to write ""The Tears of Eros""."
4,WOW!!!!!,"I'm enjoying reading the book. I find the author habitually repeats himself. Other than that, it is a good book."
3,"Interesting Topic, Only Fair Execution","While the concept of emergence is quite interesting, this book lacks enough depth to really cover the material in a meaningful way. The book is more a collection of brief essays on various topics, and does provide a useful overview of the topic.However, the same material in a more masterful writer's hands could have been a fascinating work. Each of the chapters only contained a skeletal outline of the emergent behavior, with nothing to flesh it out. Because the facts were so sketchy (and often amounted to prose hand-waving) I wasn't always convinced that the arguments were sound."
2,If you want to grow to hate sports just read this book,"This book presents an incredibly grim view of sports. Is there no good sports writing that actually deals with sport or do writers today only deal with the personalities and the pains of sports? If you want to kill any joy left of sports in your life then open up this book and let these writers open your eyes to everything negative they can find in sports. Even the ""uplifting"" stories present a world crashing down around people who have only 1 positive outlet in life, the sport they play."
2,Not worth it.,"These do not fit well on my jack stands. Like the other reviewer said they tend to pop off and shift around while lowering the vehicle. I thought after I used them once the weight of my car would press them on and snug them up. They popped back off when I pulled them out from under the car. Another thing that I want to mention is that the picture on Amazon, as of 10-30-11, for this item shows a round service jack pad along with the jack stand pads. THIS DOES NOT COME WITH A SERVICE JACK PAD AS PICTURED!!!!I was under the impression that I was getting a service jack pad with the jack stand pads. Shame on me for not reading the description more thoroughly."
2,Hey What's the deal?,"I see a picture and place an order, I expect the order to represent the picture. I only see 2 jack stand covers in the box I recevied/ Where's the Lift pad as pictured? I guess I have to wish it. Oh well.... Try try again..."
3,The best of Bill's books,Well this is the best of Bill Cosby's books. It still falls way short though. Children learning to read need better than this. It stops and starts. The pictures are great - I can't praise Miss Honeywood enough - yet the story disappoints. Best of Bill but my oh my this is pushing it Oprah!
3,ACTIONLESS,"AS A PARENT, THE REFERENCES MADE BY EACH CHARACTER'S HOBBIES LACKED TODAY'S RELEVANCE/COULD NOT KEEP MY CHILD'S INTEREST. ALTHOUGH BILL COSBY OFTEN TRIES TO ENLIGHTEN TODAY'S YOUTH WITH HIS PERSONAL CRUSADE WITH BLACK ARTIST'S AND ATHELETE'S, HE NEEDS TO REMEMBER HIS AGE GROUP AND DECADES IN WHICH HE IS WRITING."
5,We love Bernard!,"I bought this for my two year old who is obsessed with Where the Wild Things Are. She loved this toy. It is very durable, and very well made."
3,Not cat proof!,"I purchased this item from my local Walmart. It is a good mousepad overall, put it is certainly not cat proof! My little monsters eventually stuck enough claws into it to make the gel, which is VERY sticky and gross to the touch, ooze out so as to make it unusable.Probably a great item for non-animal owners, but if your puppies and kitties like to get up near your cozy, warm computer...I would not recommend the gel-type mousepads."
4,Comfortable,"The wrist rest is incredibly comfortable even after many hours. The plastic surface on the pad section has started separating from the base after about two weeks, but it's not breaking and there is always glue when it becomes an issue. Otherwise a fairly good mousepad."
3,Just ok,The wrist support works extremely well however the actual pad part started falling apart as soon as it was out of the packaging. I superglued it back to the base and it's holding up well now.
3,Your wrist bone won't pop out after using this one,"I bought fellowes gel because it had a comparatively larger area and a large gel pad and a more affordable price. My optical mouse runs pretty smoothly on this pad, although it feels kinds rough at first. However, the gel pad is not soft enough, and your wrist will probably be ""uncomfortable"" even after using the pad. I would not recommend this pad for hardcore gaming because of its limited surface area, but the gel pad is an added bonus (eventhough it gets scratched easily). Another complaint would be that the gel pad is not uniform. So, the area where the wrist wrests actually feels harder than the adjoining ""cliffs."" Nonetheless, something is better than nothing!"
1,Inferior product,"I bought this as a second, to use at my office. It doesn't match the original. It has a plastic sheen over the wrist rest that makes it not as soft as the original Belkin ""WaveRest"". Also, the mousepad surface is too hard, causing the mouse to slip around too much. Not good. This is the ""Crystals"" version and not as good as the orginal ""WaveRest""."
3,Warning: misleading picture!,"The picture for this item implies that it includes the mousepad, keyboard wrist rest, and mini rest. But that is not true; you only get the mousepad.The product looks cheap in the picture, and the actual product when it arrived matched that impression. But while getting all three for that price would be a good deal, just one is not worth it."
3,"Comfortable, but doesn't last long","The wrist rest is comfortable, the only problem was that after a couple months the piece of plastic on top of the mouse pad came loose. I can't get it back in place so it bubbles up and messes with my mouse. The area underneath is sticky so you can't remove the plastic piece and keep using it. I purchased 2 of these and it happened to both of them."
1,gel mousepad,within 2 days the pad is peeling away from the surface will not purchase this again will not reccomend to others.
5,Very Comfortable,I'm a PURPLE person.... love everything Purple...its a great addition to my office desk. Very nice and comfortable to use.
2,Delamination is a problem,"I like the gel wrist rest but after a few weeks of use, the surface totally started delaminating on both mousepads that I had bought. Somehow an air bubble developed in the middle of one of the pads. I could probably have some rubber cement or something to reglue it, but that shouldn't be necessary."
1,worst reference book I have read,This is the worst book on programming that I have bought. Mr.Barrie Sosinsky didn't write the book in a proper way where the readers can learn the magic power of Visual Foxpro.
4,"A decent overview, good for people switching from non-Visual","Sometimes too many details, sometimes not enough, but overall a good balance. And the methodology of walking all the way through one project works."
1,Very little value to anyone with a little Foxpro experience.,I bought the book because it was advertised as being intermediate to advanced level. I do not understand this since it is more like an end-user book. It certainly is not for one wanting to develope software that produces printed reports which was the reason I thought I wanted it. END
3,Mixed,"I'd have to say this book is disappointingto an extent. I'm a beginner to VFP and thoughtthis book would help me gain a betterunderstanding of how VFP works. It has inthat it does a great job of explaining thedifferent VFP commands in the early chapters.However, while Sosinsky provides step-by-stepinformation for creating differenttables, showing off VFP commands etc, he doesn't haveany data to put into the tables so the tutorialscan be rather confusing. It wouldhave been better if he had includedsample data to connect the tutorials together."
1,This book is not really all that good.,"Barry, you make no mention of how to access the features on the CD-Rom. I get read-only messages whenever I try and look at any of the underlying forms or programs. Unfortunately, I was only trying to look at the CD because I wasn't getting much out of the book to begin with."
4,"Although useful, some of the instructions were inadequate.","This is approximately an intermediate book with quite a bit of elementary material on database development that is not specific to FoxPro. I like that it gives the reader a broad overview of the development process, but it does not give enough detail to ""construct a marketable database"" as the back cover touts. As an application programer moving from FoxPro 2.x to VFP, I had many questions that went unanswered. However, I found a number of the missing answers in the VFP 5.0 documentation. I also liked that the book used the framework application included with VFP 5.0 for illustration, instead of an entirely different framework. Because the book's guidelines are consistent with Microsoft's approach, the VFP 5.0 wizards are far more useable. On the other hand, this book's discussion of VFP's OOP implementation is way too choppy and shallow to allow someone new to VFP to really use OOP effectively."
2,Bionaire Filter,"The filter dimentions were off and the only way to fit in the holder was to squash it in. This was the first in many years I faced such problem. E-mails in this regard were sent to the supplier through Amazon and directly, but I have yet to hear from them."
4,"Love, Love, Love IT!","This is a great vacuum for the price. I have 3 cats and it picks up all their hair and I have 2 kids and it picks up all the crumbs they leave behind. I also love the onboard attachments and use them often since they are located right on the unit.The only downside is that it's very heavy but it has rollers on the back so you can move around the house fairly easily.For the money, it's a great deal!"
2,"Well organized, but many errors.","The New Rider series is generally well laid out and a good summary of test material. In this case, however, the book is so poorly produced it can do positive harm to your studies if you don't have a good second source. If the numerous typos were not enough, there are specific errors of fact in important content, and erronious numbering of exercises and answers to add to your confusion.There are many more professionally finished sources than this one."
2,What a disappointment...,"I could not wait to get these shoes. It is such a stylish and good looking shoe. However, the quality did not hold up. I wore them once, and the plastic tore away from the leather. The idea was nice, but it just doesn't work."
1,"Not as good as ""it looks""","The picture is ""ok"", but appears a lot cuter on the internet than in reality. Overall, the bluebird is a little blurry in the photo, and does not look right. Another thing that sounds great.... until you get it."
1,You get what you pay for!,"I agree with G. Ryder's review. Although somewhat easy to assemble (even with directions in German!), the wheels were poorly designed. I think it does hold very small TVs (probably under 20 inches) and a single VCR adequately - nothing has tipped over yet. I was also somewhat concerned about the slightly sharp edges of the chrome, but put tape over it to avoid cuts. I wouldn't recommend it, but too much of a hassle to return it."
4,images,"Freud's work primarily through photographs of his paintings. However, the text is weak on chronology, development and current status of his painting technique. ...A good intro for the person who is not familiar with his work."
5,Highest Quality,"Joshua is a young boy who uses an alarm clock box and his imagination to create a story sequence involving an egg and then the birth of a dragon. Each new event is told after a family member asks a question about his ""pet."" Craig's use of the question is a powerful and funny pretext to the telling of the story. Readers become believers and are left wondering what really was in that box.A great read aloud, or read in parts, or present it as a play!This book should be republished. People with childhood imaginary friends could walk down memory lane! Bravo for Craig."
4,Misty Memory,"This title was included in our reader when I was in third or forth grade. I remember it as possibly the first story I read which didn't have a clear cut conclusion - the reader is never sure whether there is a dragon in the clock box or not. That stunned me as a child, that the author could leave things so abiguous. Prehaps that is why I remember this story even today. If you can find a copy, I recommend it."
1,Cheap not as described....,I bought this even after reading the other reviews. Boy they are right. This is cheap bad product. the magnet clip is way too weak. It would only work with the thinnest of headsets. I have a H780 and it doesn't hold in tight enough.
5,Preserves life of Blue Tooth,It is easy for me to find my blue tooth now. It protects the item from damage while in my purse. Was not disappointed.
5,Does the job,This is a great little holder of my bluetooth headphone the only issue is to make sure the headphone is deep inside or it will slip out.
5,good pouch for car,This works well to keep the bluetooth headset in one place out of the cup holders. I hang it on the passenger visor and it works great. I had an older model that was fine but this is better because the little flap is magnetically closed rather than the old one was velcro that has worn down and doesnt really work any more.
2,Motorola Pouch,"The Bluetooth Pouch is ok, seems a little small for the bluetooth and the fastner doesn't seem to stay closed. I would not purchase again but I will keep this one."
5,The best album ever!,"I feel like kangaroo jumping on the snow when I listened to this album...this is so relaxing...this is like a collection! Spiridon is my idol! I WORSHIP HIM! Go, Tundra-man, go!"
5,Worth a second look,"Initially I put this book back on the shelf because the photos showed garments I had no interest in making. The second time I looked through it more thoroughly and was blown away by the amount of helpful sewing hints contained with its pages. This is a fine reference for the fashion sewer as it shows exactly how to do things like sleeves, hems, zippers, etc. three different ways.I only wish they had photographed the techniques instead of the clothing."
2,Better Sewing Books Exist,"While providing lots of ideas and inspiration, Mrs. Hausmann encourages her readers with her PBS personna and years of sewing experience.Still, after a careful reading of the book, the reviewer has surmised that Nancy Zieman's 10-20-30 Minutes to Sew and Barbara Deckert's Sewing 911 are better works for a sewing reference library because each of these books fulfills the purpose of sewing faster and solving clothing construction angst issues.Look at a copy of this book at a local library before making the decision to purchase it."
1,What a Stinker!,"This book does NOT deliver. From the title, you expect to see three ways--fast, faster, and fastest--to do the same thing. But that's not what you get. Let's take sleeves for example. You don't get three ways to do a sleeve, you get three different sleeves. OF COURSE a drop sleeve is faster to sew than a set-in sleeve but those two sleeve styles are not interchangeable, so what's faster about one over the other? If you are looking for quality sewing techniques, you WON'T find them here.Even the cover is ugly, not to mention the garments inside. And would you really wear some of those things? If your idea of high fashion is the sale rack at a volume discount variety store, then MAYBE this book will appeal to you. Don't waste your money on this book. Go buy a nice piece of fabric instead!"
3,A GOOD EFFORT,"In spite of the good effort performed by director Margaret Williams,this film falls way short of showing Britten's intentions.Those of us who are familiar with the original TV broadcast from the 1970's will agree upon the fact that the original production taped at The Maltings,Snape outdoes this new attempt by miles of distance.The surroundings of Paramore are much more appropriate to the climate brought about by Henry James's novel upon which the opera is based.The updatingof the action I find,like all updatings quite ludicrous and mediocre in taste.Good singing from canadian baritone Gerald Finley and the rest of the cast is also appropriate with the exception of the role of Spencer Coyle tackled in the old tape by bass-baritone John shirley-Quirk in a much better fashion.It remains a passible attempt with three stars as qualification."
5,WONDERFUL,"This was the first opera I've seen Gerald Finley perform...WOW!!! I wasn't especially impressed by the rest of the cast, but Gerald Finley is so talented he makes the rest pale by comparison. I want the rest of his performances on DVD. I want his operas, his concerts and anything else he does. I confess I have only recently discovered this young man and his talents, but I am now a total convert! Since most baritone roles are the bad guy, this fellow will have me cheering for the dark side!!!! More, please!"
1,I didn't like it at all,"It's really liquid, like water. So it's difficult to apply to the body. I wouldn't recommend unless you are going to use it on the sponge or wash cloth. And the smell is really close to Powder Air Freshener from Glad. I was really dissappointed."
5,Great book for Early SNL fans like me,"I'm an older SNL fan and I do remember seeing several of Schiller's films on SNL. What I enjoyed most about the book is the details provided for every step of Schiller's cinema portfolio. I never realized how involved the filmmaking process was for a short clip. The writing is easy-going and quite engaging. The photos are precious, and I would have preferred to see them on glossy paper as opposed to on regular paper. Any one who loves films and is considering film as a career should pick up the book. The book really provides a bird's eye view of what the industry is really like: the good and the bad. Makes me appreciate Schiller's work even more."
2,"TOO DATED,IN SOUND AND PERFORMANCE","CAN ANYBODY CONDUCT(INTERPRET)THIS GREAT TCHAIKOVSKY MASTERPIECE BESIDES CHARLES DUTIOT AND THE MONTREAL SYMPHONY VERSION,THIS IS NOT ONE OF THE BETTER ONES,ONCE AGAIN DORATI IS COLD THE MELODIC PHRASING IS STIFF AND BLAND AND SO IS THE PLAYING FROM THE MINNESOTA ORCHESTRA."
5,Awesome - a Must Have for Mary Kay Consultants!,"Robert Jones is remarkable! Just look at the before and afters and they speak for themselves!! He does a phenomenal job with every model, who are all Mary Kay ladies by the way! Get the hardcover book to go with it, and you have the best reference material!"
1,Long Extended Trailer for Book,Seems like one long advert for the book. The fast MTV-style editing doesn't allow the viewer to grasp the details in various techniques introduced. Save your money on this one ladies.
1,DOUBLE WEDDING RING QUILT- PILLOW SHAM,"THIS AD WAS VERY MISLEADING AND I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN, I READ THE AD TO PURCHASE A DOUBLE WEDDING RING QUILT - PILLOW SHAM AND ENDED UP PAYING 37 FOR A PAIR OF PILLOW SHAMS AND NOT GETTING A QUILT, WHICH THE PILLOW SHAMS ARE OF NO USE TO ME NOW, WASTED MONEY"
4,Mike Nelson never disappoints!,I've been a huge fan of Rifftrax ever since I stumbled upon them back when they first came out. I'm so glad they are releasing stuff on DVD now. We just finished watching Planet of Dinosaurs last night and both my wife and I loved it. There were several laugh-out-loud moments and the running commentary kept us entertained throughout. Another strong entry in the Rifftrax collection. I highly recommend this one. I hope they keep them coming!
5,GREAT acting by the dinosaurs...not so much the humans.,"I A=C=T=U=A=L=L=Y w=a=n=t=e=d this '70s movie""PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS"" because of the excel-lent, so-called, stop motion animation like the firstKING KONG movie, and those Ray Harryhausen movies likeIT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA; EARTH Vs. THE FLYINGSAUCERS; MYSTERIOUS ISLAND; and 20-MILLION MILES TOEARTH.The price of this stand-alone movie was outrageous, elsewhere.Planet of Dinosaurs (20th Anniversary Edition Widescreen )Here, at this LOW price ((it is scratchy & full screen though))you have the option of making fun of the horrible acting, and,particularly, the enept direction.The option RIFFTRAX is like watching a movie with ME(!)in the1980s.I'm sure ==> I <== enjoyed ME more than the audience did,but, when you're in your sixties (now)--like me--there IS some-thing to be said about NOT growing up.I recommend this for the dinosaurs and the wiseguy in all of us.Courtesy of remarks, ala MST 3000!Buy it!"
4,"""PLANET OF POLYESTER AND DINOSAURS!""","Oh are YOU in for a TREAT! Take a Group of 1978 Polyester-Jumpsuited ""Astronauts"", throw them on a Planet full of stop-motion effects Dinosaurs and watch the laughs fly! This movie wants so hard to be taken seriously, but trips at every turn! ""Captain,what the heck is going ON?!"" That's what we ALL want to know! Hilarious Spoofing by your Favorite Mystery Science Theater 3000 Veterans of Fun. ENJOY and LOOK OUT for Dinosaurs! (And very bad acting)=)"
5,Funny Movie,"In this futuristic movie about a space ship that lands on a planet infested with dinosaurs,Mike Kevin, and Bill have no mercy or shortage of riffs to blast this movie back to the stoneage.Very Funny."
5,MST3K is back.,"I first found out about RiffTrax.com in late 2006. Loved it instantly. If I had one complaint, it was that they were only focusing on more up to date movies like Star Wars and major blockbusters such as Transformers and Iron Man. This DVD did exactly what I had hoped they would do: Attack the movies that made them famous, the low budget sci-fi films of late.Watching this brought back the same feelings that watching MST3K did back in the day. Don't get me wrong, all RiffTrax are funny. Just this style of movie is the kind that truly have it coming and its an easy target.This is definitely worthe the view for any who can't stand boring old sci-fi movies, are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, or just like sarcastic humor of any kind."
2,To hard for comfort....,"Other than the nice color purple, this is just too hard, might as well rest on the desk other than it providing a little height off the desk."
1,Worthless,"While the actual shape of this wrist rest was decent, it was hard enough that after a week I started shopping for another one. I eventually bought a HandStands bean-bag wrist rest that I am much happier with."
3,Easy on the wrist,"From a comfort standpoint, this is very good. I have some wrist pain when I use a mouse, and this makes it much more comfortable to the point where I'm pain free. So 100% in that department. What I don't like is the strong chemical smell that this has. I've used this for about 2 weeks, and the chemical smell is somewhat less pronounced. Or maybe I've just gotten used to it."
5,Wonderful product,"This gel pad was a life saver. I had carpel tunnel and while I was waiting to have surgery, this allowed me to use the keyboard pain free."
5,Perfect Wrist Rest,"This wrist rest was exactly what I needed! It's soft plastic, gel feel is perfect for under my wrist as I'm using the mouse. I like this one as opposed to the fabric covered one because you can slide your wrist and it feels cooler. It's size is about 3.5"" x 5"" and fits right on my slide out drawer next to the keyboard. I received this quickly & I'm very happy with my purchase!!! :o)"
4,Not bad,"Shape and size were nice and what I wanted, smaller than most. I bought two for my laptop and attempted to use one on each side of my built in mouse, but they were a bit high for this purpose. I have not used them for a regular mouse and believe they would work. The only down fall is I was expecting the really squishy gel and these were a bit firmer than I would have liked. No problem with funky smells like others have mentioned"
4,PARTY,I bought this book because my parent's were celebrating their 40th anniversary. My brothers and sisters and I wanted some ideas so that they would remember such a wonderful day. There were many ideas for both parties and gatherings and presents.
5,Great Ideas and Sources,"Fun book filled with lots of inspirational ideas, sources and websites for gift giving, party giving, gift wrapping and more!It's a great ""idea book""!"
5,I give it an A for adorable!,"I saw Laurin Sydney talking about her book on The Rosie O'Donnell show this morning, and thought the projects were so adorable, that i ordered a copy of the book for myself. The projects that she did on the show were fabulous. I love the idea that everyone deserves to be treated like stars. Thanks Laurin!"
5,Deep Cuts.... Big Hits !,"Well, I own this cd since last summer and I still listen to it several times a week. I agree with previous reviewer Suzanne, this cd is great. It may only show one side of that talented band, but that's made with class. First this is a good idea to have re-recorded some older tracks with new guitar wizz Richtie Kotzen. Then the new tracks are brilliant, like ""Whey Are They Now"". And they still can write big songs like ""You Don't Have To Be strong"", with such a hook that you can't resist to sing ! It can only give you the need to listen to all others Mr Big albums. What will make you (re)discover a genius band ! Oh, and by the way, Suzanne, thank your cute sister for the cd booklet nice pictures !"
5,pirate beads,"This item was added to my Halloween costume as Capt. Jack Sparrow. The devil is in the details, and this small item did the trick. It is an inexpensive way to build up this costume, but it made the whole thing look authentic. I will probably go as the same character next year, and this item can be used again. Good job."
3,Don't know how to wear it.,"Nice replica of the bandana thing that Sparrow carries but I really don't know how and where to bend it. So, despite nicely reproduced from the movie, feels kind of useless."
4,Useful and handy,"well organized, handy and almost covers all useful materials, and based on latest structural codes.The only negative points is lack of efough examples."
5,Nice Shirt.,My brother is a big fan of Iron Maiden and had asked for this shirt for Christmas. He was thrilled when he got it and it's held up well.
1,"one sentence at a time, one sentence after another","This is a book written one sentence at a time. It has no narrative, no structure. It is not a biography of London, it is the sporadic ramblings of a sozzled maiden aunt, only occasionally engaging. It jumps around all over the place both chronologically and thematically, apparently chasing whatever springs up in the author's mind, with no coherence whatesoever. Although individual sentences can be dynamic and often novel, the novelty soon wears off in the shapeless repetition of unrelated iterations. Tedious. A tome, a death knell, couldn't read it, agonisingly atrocious. Took it to the charity shop, where it's resale might do some good, but pity the poor shopper who rebuys it; should have a misery warning."
2,"A most disappointing ""biography"" about the British capital","This weighty tome about the life of the city of London was a massive disappointment, and a grueling and nearly impossible book to read. It isn't a biography in the linear sense, rather it is a collection of short chapters about different aspects of the city throughout its history, including its rivers, churches, theatres, and outcasts. Each chapter consists mainly of quotes from other sources, and its lack of narrative flow makes for an exceptionally dry and thoroughly unrewarding read, which reminded me of an 800 page essay written by a college freshman. Anyone brave enough to tackle this book is advised to read it in tiny segments, or, as I did, skim the book to read the most interesting sections."
2,"""Biography"" only in the loosest sense","If this book were a biography of a person, say Abraham Lincoln, we'd get something like a chapter dealing with Lincoln's food preferences from baby porridge to his last dinner before going on to the Ford Theater. Then we would be treated to a discussion of what he wore beginning with swaddling clothes and ending with his taste in stove pipe hats. In other words, there would be only the murkiest and most difficult to follow time line, with Mr. Lincoln's life chopped up into arbitrary chapters, some of which don't even stick to their stated topic. Neither good history nor a good read."
4,overkill?,"Great book if you can read it. This ""biography"" of London is full of facts (and few if any footnotes) but they are presented thematically (i.e., drink, religion, art, poverty, wealth, etc.) rather than chronologically, with the result that it is somewhat discombobulated. The author assumes the reader is familiar with various place names, a false assumption for readers not from London or the U.K., and better maps with more explanation would be a godsend to this book. This books is recommended if you have the time and the patience and a few good maps of London for reference."
2,Rambling and incoherent,"For the life of me, I can't figure out why this book gets so much good press. Ackroyd has clearly never met a metaphor that he didn't like, and apparently feels that the frequent (and often bizarrely misplaced) use of such can replace good writing. The whole book reads like a giant editorial which has no point, and facts merge too subtly into half-truths, suppositions, and out-and-out falsities without any guidance to navigate through through them. If you're looking for a good history of London, look elsewhere. If you're looking for good commentary on London society throughout the ages, tough luck."
4,complete and thorough,"The definitive book on the life of london, its entire history since earliest time, to an insightful description of all those little details about the city that those who have lived there will love. Some subjects i found boring, but he deals with so many different topics that theres something for everydoby in there, from the life of children, to a history of the subterranean life of london, to the history of revolutionary ideas in Clerkenwell. Its got it all. At 800 pages, and a great bibliography, its excellent value for money"
2,Literary chaos,"As an admirer of Ackroyd's other books, I hate to say it--but this book is a stinker. It's not a history but a series of anecdotes and scattered facts. The feeling of reading it is rather like reading an encyclopedia from cover to cover: interesting but scatterbrained. London is my second home and I've read many histories of her. As a companion volume, Ackroyd's book might be acceptable. But let the reader beware that this IN NO WAY will suffice as one's first history of London. This book needed a better editor to restrain its author's robust energy."
5,THE BOOK OF THE YEAR!!!,"I want to warn you that if you start reading this book you will not be able to put it down.This sounds like a cliche but it is true.Mr.Ackroyd is definitely a master of words and knows his subject very well.I would say that he is Dickensian when writing about his beloved London.So ,make room on your bookshelf for the book of the year for 2001!"
3,Needs a story,"A ""biography"" is the story of a life, usually told more or less in chronological order. Peter Ackroyd's London, however, is really a series of interconnected essays on London: on food, on drink, on the weather, on fog, on darkness, on streetlights, etc. Too many of these essays take the form of a set of quotes, each followed by a sentence or two of explication, rather than brief narratives. Ackroyd has found some great quotes, and some fascinating facts, and does a superb job evoking the feeling of the city at different times and in different aspects. When he does tell a story, such as the story of the Gordon riots, he tells it well. I was left looking for more story, and fewer quotes."
4,Bill Graham Presents,A great look into the earlier years of Rock & Roll. Filled with wonderful stories from the 60's & 70's.A must read for any fan of Rock & Roll.
5,An incredibly interesting book,"This might be one of the best books I've ever read. It's interesting from page one, and I haven't been able to put it down.God Bless You , Bill."
3,"A Script, Not Focused on Topic","If you're looking for a book about Bill Graham and his philosophies in regards to life and work, this may not be that book. There's a lot of material, in this book, that has nothing to do with Bill Graham, himself.The format of this book more resembles a script for a documentary, far more than it could resemble a literary biography about such a great man as Bill Graham, himself, was.I'll give it three stars, as an ""E for effort."" No dice, with me. The world still waits on a book truly about Bill Graham, at work."
5,One of the greatest 'Rock' books of all time,"I truly can't say enough about this book. It's an incredibly informative piece of work, insightful in so many ways other than simply the rock industry--although it has a lot to say about that too. But the the story of Bill Graham's life is far more entertaining than any self-indulgent 'memoir' you can possibly think of.You don't have to be a music fanatic to love this book; just a human being is enough. But for a behind-the-scenes look at Woodstock, Altamont, Live Aid, Amnesty Internation, the Stones various tours, CSNY, Santana, the Dead... you can't get anything that compares to it.RIP Bill. You definitely deserve it."
5,"Not just a ""rock bio.""","Known for his groundbreaking entrepreneurship as the first rock music promoter, Bill Graham provides some surprises in this outstanding autobiography. His account of his family's flight from the Holocaust provides a moving and gripping first act. There is plenty of color as he essentially invents the ""rock concert"" as we now know it, and contributions in their own words from key figures in his life provide a well-rounded portrait of this powerful, driven man.Even if your interest in rock music is small, this biography will hold your attention due to its rich evocation of a fascinating life."
4,Would recommend . Great success story.,This book gave a real account of the in's and out's of the music business. Loved the format. Sorry about ending!
2,UH...OK,PREFER THE DUMMIER VERSION. IT'S SIMPLY MORE COMPETE AND EASIER TO FOLLOW AND TO GRASP THE EXERCISES.
5,Best introductory book,"Most of the reviews written prior to me (3-13-08) seem to be from those with professional vocal training background. My brief review is from a layman who read or perused many introductory singing instructions books to teach myself.This is, by far, the best single introductory book I've seen. Clearly written, well organized, Complete Idiot's series uses better paperstock and graphics design than Dummies series (easier to read), and, the author is clearly more knowledgeable than most other authors.Most other authors describe and favor a way of preferred singing and focus on preferred styles of music. The authors here are far more understanding--recognizing that some may want opera, jazz, rock, etc, and they recognize that different types of training are suitable for these.From among the many singing books I've reviewed, this is the single best introductory book to begin with."
4,I like this book.,"It gives specific information for a beginner about how to sing. It has some simple diagrams/pictures in black and white that help you see what is going on when you sing. It has a chapter about how to start sight singing. It explains what to expect when you inhale/exhale where a beginner can understand it. I think it is a good book for beginners. If you do not know anything about how to actually sing, this book is pretty good."
3,Wonderful sound; ponderous tempi; no drive.,"Abbado's success with the Brahms symphonies is mixed -- and I think I like least his performance of this jewel in the crown. His tempi drag and the orchestra (or Abbado) is not up to sustaining the inherent tension in the massive opening theme. Unfortunately, the flabbiness of these bars forshadows much of what happens later. Toscannini must have turned in his grave when Abbado chose his tempi and permitted his orchestra to play in so relaxed a manner. Richly sonorous strings and overall wonderful sound, however, help dress up this disappointing effort.If this is your first experience with the First, don't despair. Try the old Toscannini -- or the newer Wand. I've read good things about Levine's performance, too, but haven't heard it yet."
5,A very surprising performance,"I have gone through several recordings of this symphony: Gardiner, Giulini, 2 by Karajan, Klemperer, Jochum, Stokowski, Rattle and this one by Abbado. If I have to choose between them, surprisingly even for me, I would go for this one. The performance is very polished, but extremely passionate, direct and strong at the same time. Klemperer's and the earliest of Karajan's versions are also great, but both recordings show their age. Abbado's recording is their equal in performance but with a far better recording sound. So, even if you have several other recordings of this work I strongly recommend this one, it will not disappoint. By the way, Gardiner's disc is also great but, of course, it is not really comparable here because of the period instruments, another recommendation."
5,Renegade,"Renegade was probably one of my most favorites, following Renno to England one minute and through the forests the next. I have a copy of each book of the series which I started collecting when I was 17 and have read each one at least 4 times. It really makes you feel like your part of the story."
1,Disappointing,"I wanted to get a wrist rest when I saw and tried the blue Fellowes wrist rest that a receptionist at my old office used. It was thick and comfortable and soft.When I got this one, it was half as thick and practically useless. I have to stack business cards underneath to get it as high as I need it to be."
1,too short,"only .5"" high not .9""other than obvious lack of function due to height, the material is good, no leaks, does not stiffen up over time, no bad smellInnovera is a better brand"
1,They don't build them like they used to.,"I have two Fellowes gel wrist rests that were purchased at least three years ago. They are used every day and are still in excellent condition. The new one, which I have had for only a few months and have used very little, is already starting to show signs of wear. The gel is permanently indented where my left wrist rests. The new wrist rest is approximately half as thick as my old ones and the gel feels much softer. Very disappointing."
3,thin and long / good for keyboards / bad for laptops,"it's about 1.5 cm thick and 18.5 in long.I wanted to use it with my macbook pro (because the edges are too sharp), but as another reviewer indicated it's thickness (or lack thereof) is not large enough to provide support and I find my wrists still hanging off the keyboard.However, I found it very pleasant to use with a regular keyboard.So, it all depends on what you are looking for... laptop or keyboard use!"
3,Not bad,Does what it says on the box - but didn't like the plasticy surface after long periods of use. Prefer a fabric covered wrist support.
4,stinky but good!,"every once in a while, this thing emits a really strong and foul odor, but not all the time, and my husband can't smell it. i should say that i have a very sensitive sense of smell, and he doesn't, but if you do, this might not be for you. on the other hand, it works well. i've had it for a couple of months, and i have much less muscle strain than before. it seems sturdy, too."
1,Too Firm. Hurts my Wrists.,"When my older, non-Fellowes Gel pad wore out, I purchased this one instead. Unlike my old ""gel"" bad, this one is rock hard. It has almost no give, and hurts my wrists a lot. I returned it after only 6 hours of use as the pain was just too much to even try to use it longer."
1,The Worst After Effects Book you can buy,"""After Effects Most Wanted"" is easily the worst book on AE I have ever tried to sit down and use. The construction of each tutorial makes little sense, the plug in's used are not included, and most of the files you need are simply not on the CD. Those that are there are usually labelled incorrectly or corrupt.I wrote the publisher about the missing files, and they pointed me to a site that gave me the suspect files for only one chapter, the rest are no where to be found.The tutorials are badly written/organized, and incredibly tough to follow for even advanced users. The whole thing was an excercise in frustration and I hope this review can save you the same stress. If you want to learn some intermediate-advanced After Effects, definitely look elsewhere."
4,The real deal from Mono and the boys!,"Listen up folks, if you don't own this classic piece of punk/garage/rock'n'roll history you might as well give up on rock'n'roll and start buyin' boy band CDs! Mono man and the DMZ crew easily rank up there with the Ramones, Real Kids and New York Dolls as far as early punk goes. This disc is basically a reissue of the Relics LP and contains some bonus tracks and rarities. DMZ never really got much attention and are sadly ignored by so-called "" music critics "" who, for some reason, leave DMZ out of every history of the early punk movement. Well hipsters, those critics can jump off of a bridge 'cause DMZ rule!"
4,Good charm bracelet,"I really like this bracelet. It looks great on. I would recommend it, however, if you are getting it to add charms, go with the 8 inch so it will dangle nicely."
1,"Nice Bracelet, but barely 7""","I purchased this bracelet based on previous reviews. Yes, it is a nice bracelet; however, it is just barely 7"" from end to end and not 7"" for just the chain. After adding charms it won't fit my daughter's wrists and yet she has a very small wrist. Now I'm stuck with a $$ piece of jewelry that can't be used."
2,Low quality construction,"Low grade plastic that cracks easily in areas critical for support of batteries. Just when you need a reliable flashlight, you can forget about this one - and if you drop it with heavy batteries loaded, you may as well through them away."
2,Disappointing,"Unlike the larger Yamaha recorders I have (soprano and Alto) this one has an incorrigibly shrill sound no matter how the breath is modified to accomodate it. The price is great of course, but the old adage comes to mind, ""you get what you pay for...""."
5,best filter anywhere,"MSR and the Sweetwater filter system is the best I've found. I've used it all over the US and for years in Israel. I've taken water from wadi's in Israel and had no problems due to the fantastic filtration of this filter. I won't go anywhere without one. Sturdy, easy to clean, compact and light. What more can you ask for?"
3,Received as described,"This product was delivered as described in the advertisement. This is my second filter for the sweetwater purifier. In general, both the purifier and filter are of high quality and seem to last. If you haven't purchased the purifier yet, I would consider a Pur model just based on output per number of pumps. My buddies who have pur models will fill a nalgene bottle in half the time it takes me."
3,Average Rating,"If you choose to purchase the book, you will learn something. If you are interested using stories and humor for your speeches, then give this book a chance. It is not bad, but it is okay"
3,MAT review,"Good book, a little too basic if you are aiming for the 99th percentile, add Sternberg and Budd for completeness. Good art and literature section, good vocabulary list. Inadequate for history. Do all the practice tests, pace yourself during the exam, it's difficult but you will do better than you think."
3,An OK Addition,"I have used this book for a few years to get a quick understanding of a C/C++ topic and how it translates to a corresponding Ada capability. This book is not extensive with examples, but provides minimal explanation, albeit adaquate for communicating the essential concepts and the way to do it in Ada. A useful book for people conversant in C/C++ who wish to determine the quick way to do it in Ada. I wish there were some more detailed explanation and examples available, but then I go on to other in depth Ada books for a more thorough explanation. You should be knowledgeable in C/C++ before ordering, but most people are."
1,"Despite the potential, this one fails bitterly.","This book is hideous. Vast numbers of grammatic, editorial, factual, and programmatic errors poision the entire reading experience. Entire passages are utterly incomprehensible on the first reading. It's obvious the book has its origins as a sloppy newsgroup posting. With all the other high-quality Ada books available, save your money for something worthwhile. It's quite a shame, actually, because this topic and approach could help many C and C++ bigots to see the light, if the execution weren't so abysmally weak."
3,"Useful for maintenance, not for purchase of a spa","This is helpful to understand the operations and ""guts"" of a hottub/spa, but not helpful in making decisions on which brand or type to buy initially. Once you have one, it is helpful in doing repairs yourself, and optimally maintaining it."
2,Very Very confusing book,"Sorry for any harsh comments. But the book is so confusing explaining even simple concepts. I got frustrated when he tries to beat around the bush to explain STRONG NAMES.I wish there was a Amit Kalani for 70-340.For that matter, I am not having good experience with any of the Microsoft Press books on .NET"
5,Excellent,"The book touches on all areas that one has to learn in order to pass the test. But it is a guide, not a comprehensive learning resource. So after I read each chapter, I sat down at the computer and practiced. While doing so, I found myself referencing the online Visual Studio .NET documentation. Once done with the book, I took the sample exam. I did all of the 300 questions and I made sure I understood each one. Again, I practiced and I read documents online. There is a lot to know about security. The book and the test kept me focused on the information I needed to know about the test. I often purchase and use a Transcender test in addtion to reading a book, but this time around that was not needed. Now that the test is done, I'll be keeping this book on the shelf and ... coding a little safer :-)"
3,Kraan - 'Andy Nogger' (EMI),"Originally put out in 1975,looks to be Kraan's third effort.Even though this is like the third Kraan CD I've ever heard,I have no need to collect every one of their releases.Like Soft Machine,I've always thought that Kraan was just a bit TOO jazzy for my taste.Many fans consider these guys to be like free-form jazz rock pioneers,I'm sure.Tunes here that I was somewhat impressed with were the experimental title track ""Andy Nogger"",""Holiday Am Marterhorn"",the rather funky ""Home"" and ""Yellow Balloon""."
1,very weak,"We showed this to students to show them what not to do(seriously). It is that bad. If you do hapkido do not waste your money, if you don't, do not let this be the example of what hapkido is."
2,This stuff is terrible,I bought this because I got reading all the fantastic 5 star reviews. This stuff is so terrible I couldn't take more than a few bites and threw the rest in the garbage. Now I'm stuck with 5 more soups left that I'll just donate to the homeless.
3,Too large of serving.,"I have tried several of the oatmeal cups. This one has good flavor, does not seem as sweet but does have a lot of sugar. Nice texture. But I don't want all my starch servings with breakfast. Won't buy again just for that reason."
4,Don't buy it,"The product tastes great - but it's too much for a normal person, and there is no way to make half - you would have to make it and split it with someone...which kind of defeats the convenience of the product."
2,NOT GLUTEN FREE,"Just to let everyone know, this product is NOT gluten free. It contains barley, which is not a GF grain. My favorite Dr. McDougall's soup is the Black Bean! So good!"
2,bad taste,"the product was all as advertised except for its taste. it did not taste good. moreover, the almonds did not add to the taste and tasted like plastic chips almost. just a bad taste overall. would not recommend."
4,"Strong Debut album, but eclipsed by their later releases","A strong debut CD and a good introduction to the band. The songs are all strong and well executed, and it's well worth having this CD as a refernece for a band that will be breaking through into ""instant stardom"" any day now"
4,"Great, fun flick","I really enjoyed the movie, the acting was very good and believable, nothing robotic or forced... there was great chemistry amongst the actors and each character behaved like they really would according to their personalities... and I loved how their whole ordeal began, and the interactions developed, and I was especially surprised at the depth and wisdom... anyone who reads Men's Health/woman's/cosmo will appreciate the concept of ""connections""... it was a really good movie."
4,Fun to watch - good concert fooage,Enjoyed watching this film on a late Friday night coming home from a long exhausting week. It wasn't too deep and it was exactly what I needed. Filming at an actual concert made me long for those long weekend music festivals.
4,Fun Flick - Good story of stumbling into your lover,The story line and the acting is top knotch. It is about finding love you were not expecting. The story is done in a way that you would not expect. Watch and enjoy
2,Too short,I was really excited when I got the item but it was shorter than the listed length. After three days of wearing it a got a bumb on the bottom. I believe it was because the jewelry was cheap.
1,Color looked weird..,"The color looked alot different from the picture. It only glowed for a minute, if that and it just wasn't very cute."
2,Doesn't last,"I bought this for my 20 year old daughter. The balls won't stay on the ends, she is constantly losing them. It does glow in the dark, though very dimly. She is not very happy with it."
4,Tiny Ring,"The ring is very nice. But Very Tiny. Small. Molecular. I got a green one and a purple one and I can barely make out the colors on them. No flaws or defects, just small."
1,Disappointing,"The picture on the web shows a protected handle that stands upright. The 1050 cage I got did not have the protective plate with the handle standing upright. There is no way you can carry the cage with the animal in it without being subject to bites, scratches. The new ""handle"" is a flimsy piece of metal with two holes in it for your hand. The only way you can carry it is by having you hands protruding into the cage. I just received it yesterday, it is going back as soon as UPS can pick it up.I have a Havahart 1085. It works great! I will order another 1085."
2,Not for armadillos,"I've been trapping for 50 years. Using Havahart for as long as I can remember. Had to get more traps recently and discovered the current models just are not as sturdy as the old ones. Model 1045 and 1050 both worked fine for opossum, feral cat, squirrels, rabbits and raccoons. Neither held a trapped armadillo, even though armadillo pictures are on the boxes and at least one place specifically recommended the 1050 for armadillos. The armadillo just kept pushing on the bottom of the closed door until the top of the trap was bent upward enough for the spring mechanism to just flop out, so nothing held the door closed. Older models have a slightly different design and heavier reinforcing wire around the openings."
3,Got it to work-But!,"This is advertized as being made for large raccoons. First caught a juvenile raccoon, but by morning the coon had nearly wrecked the trip mechanism and escaped. After repairing and reinforcing the bottom trip mechanism we able to catch and keep the coon without it escaping. In the final analysis the trap does work, but needs to be reinforced in the area associated with the bottom trip mechanism. Rating is 3 star based on the poor design of the bottom trip mechanism."
1,"EATS Bait, EVADES capture","I followed the instructions to a T. Set trap with various kinds of bait. Everytime I set the trap, I found the bait gone in the morning, the trap door closed, but NO raccoons inside! A waste of my time and money! But the raccoons are getting fatter."
3,Trap,"The trap works well, and provides suprises, two nights two skunks. The problem was getting them out. I tapped the trap with a long pole, hoping they would shoot their load. One did, but the second saved some. Got me on the upper body from 10 plus feet away. Finally covered and moved them into the truck bed. Made two 10 mile trips into the boonies. Released each one in the same place. Hope they are happy. Wished Havahart had a better release mechanism."
1,No middle size 2 door cage trap,"This one is too small to catch Squirrel. However, the one I returned before this order was too big for squirrel yet cost me extra $15 for return."
4,She loved it,"I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she absolutely loved it. The picture provided doesn't give it enough justice. In her words its ""cute, adorable and sexy"". Give it as a gift or buy it for yourself"
4,Beautiful Ring!!!,"This ring was very pretty and good quality. However, I personally found the top flower to be too heavy and wasn't able to wear it."
5,love it,"Bought for my daughter, she loves it and looks like the picture shown. I would recommend to others to purchase"
3,Its not all that..,"I bought this belly ring because its looked as if it is shiny, but its not. When I received it, part of the belly ring was turning brown, Im guessing from being old. I took alcohol and cleaned it, and it is as good as new. Im kind of dissapointed because it does not shine as much as I hoped and the colors are not as bright as they look in the picture."
1,Cheap!,"It was really pretty when I got it, but a little misshaped. I managed to manipulate it back into it's original design and put it in. However, within 48 hours of wearing it, the top diamond fell out. I then tried to remove it upon noticing what had happened and wouldn't you know it, the thing snapped off leaving the back rod part stuck in my navel! I had to maneuver it out awkwardly. Save your money."
4,SO CUTE!,I haven't put this one in yet (just got it pierced) but it is so cute and is decent quality!
5,Just one more piece of the avalanche,"The book of Mormon has problems.I believe the Bible as God's word. I can read about the historical places and people contained therein and archaeologists find evidence for it all the time.There is no archaeological evidence for the book of Mormon and its vast societies with advanced technology in the western hemisphere. Now this author, a former Mormon, a professional geneticist, had to confront the fact that there is no DNA evidence that the so-called ""Lamanates"" (Native Americans and Polynesians) have any genetic ancestors among the Jewish people.When you're done reading this take a look at ""the Spaulding enigma"" and read about why the book of Moromon is so wildly inaccurate, it was written as a historical romance before being stolen from a publisher and turned into the Book of Mormon."
4,Temple for the educated,"I am intrigued by the detail that was included in this writing. This man has changed the history of the church. His attention to detail is impeccable and I have done the research to make sure! Much of what is written is dry stats and not always engaging . But this is the point. Numbers do not lie. This guy did his homework. I am not a practicing Mormon, I am a theologian, working to discover the truth. I abide by many of the Mormon tenets and therefore look to seek truth. Good book, slow read."
5,"Simon says...""","Simon says, the book of mormon was a figment of Joseph Smith's imagination. I couldn't agree more...."
2,Straw man arguments abound,"The writer goes through ramblings about how unscientific BYU and FARMS is. This isn't sticking to the subject, however. He spends at least a chapter going over this instead of going over what he promised: how theology is being reshaped by science."
3,By Sam On the side,"Some testing sites have been overlooked. A growing number of DNA tests seem to indicate native North American Indians, particularly ""Hopewell"" tribes of the Mississippi flood plane, match DNA found surrounding ancient Israel. These findings may be ignored by many non-Mormons like myself. I found the book well written and interesting. I enjoy researching this fascinating subject and the proposed migration patterns."
5,"Engrossing, in all simplicity.","I read this book, after deriving my own conclusion on the cogency of the Book of Mormon. I must say, it only aided to deepen my conviction in the belief that the Book of Mormon is a falsity. Being a sophomore in a Utah High school, I have learned that Mormon belief always has only one single fortress to which they can retreat when science and factual evidence disables it.Through reading the reviews of this and other books attacking the Book of Mormon, I have seen that believers always have the same response to factual evidence: Strong feelings from God, telling them of the truth of the Book of Mormon; spiritual encounters; etc. These people believe in something which cannot truly stand before logic and reason. In bitter denial they spit out that their God tells them the truth. Can something only supported by emotion be truly significant in the face of reason?"
1,Trust in the Lord With All Thine Heart and Lean Not Unto Thine Own Understanding,"boy how quickly people seem to forget that wise counsel from the book of Proverbs chapter 3 verses 5-7. My whole review of this book lies in that scripture alone.5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.The answer is simple: If God tells you that something is true, what matters about man's reason and intelectual powers? The kinds of people who write these books are those who lack faith, and who think they are wiser than God. Be weary of such individuals."
1,What a disappointment,"To call this amateur writing is too much a compliment. I got this because it won the Booker prize, but am perplexed at how they reached that conclusion. What's next? Are they going to put accolades on a book that portrays young black children as addicted to crack and watermelon? Jews who are stingy?The only people who seemed to vote in favor of this book are more interested in insulting Americans and ""teaching them a lesson"" than discussing the novel itself. Perhaps they could barely finish it as well?"
1,trash,"astoundingly bad. first snot joke, third sentence. first piss joke, fifth sentence. ratio of: his mom reminding Vernon about his uncontrolled bowels, to, times mom is mentioned: about 99 to 100 (i might have missed one). characters with two characteristics; none. got the booker for it's simplistic anti-americanism."
4,Deeper than it seems,"I don't know who thought this book was comedic, but once you get past the glibness of the narrative and the colloquial foul language, the story is dark and thought-provoking.What do we consider innocence? Why are rights more important than obligations? The voice of a 15 year old masks the seriousness of it. There are wisps of Catcher in the Rye, but maybe because change in cultural references, I find this more powerful.The 15 year old voice sometimes gets too literary and obtuse for the character, which is distracting, but I'd read the next one."
2,Plodding mess,"I just recently picked this book up at the library and seeing that it won the Man Booker Prize, I thought it would be a worthwhile read. I thought wrong - the book was frustrating and the characters seemed like cardboard cut-outs. It wasn't the steady stream of profanity that put me off, for what other language is to be expected from characters like Vernon, a 15-year-old rebellious teenager? It was just that the writing seemed to plod on and on and I couldn't sympathize with any of the characters. I wonder if I'm in the minority, that I simply didn't get it? Oh well, there's no accounting for literary taste, I guess. Two other highly lauded books that I found torturous to finish were Arundhati Roy's ""The God of Small Things"", and Kiran Desai's ""The Inheritance of Loss."" As for ""Vernon God Little"", all I could say when I reached the end was a prayer that it had finally ended!"
2,Mostly disappointing,"DBC Pierre is an unusually talented wordsmith, with a keen sense for unique metaphors and similes. But his ability seems not to extend beyond such small-scale exercises. The novel is meandering, tedious and riddled with plot holes and improbable twists, and lacking in the kind of anecdotic detail that gives a story depth and texture. The topic is ambitious, grandiose even, but the treatment is amateurish and uninsightful. Finally, and most annoyingly, the allegedly Texan voice is utterly fake. It is incredibly ambitious for DBC Pierre to attempt to write in a vernacular that is not his own, and he fails miserably. The use of ridiculously quaint character names and homonymes is initially cute and works well, but overuse ultimately kills it.Maybe one day we'll find out why this book won one of the most prestigious British literary prizes. Peter Finlay's ultimate scam?"
2,Vernon God Little: Worth Not Very Much,"What a strange book! A surprise winner of the 2003 Booker Prize and certainly not what I expected.I suspect that many people, particularly the prudish and easily offended, will be aghast at the book and mark it down accordingly. I am not in that camp. The use of four letter words is fine depending on context and, in the context of this book, they are of no problem. The book, however, can be marked down for other reasons.I found the plot to be confusing. I found the characters to be little more than caricature. In fact, except for a brief section well into the book where Vernon is arrested in Mexico, I really couldn't wait for the torment to be over. Quite simply, this book has been given way too much hype.Having laid my cards on the table, this will still not turn people off the book. My opinion counts for little in comparison with a Booker Prize. Regardless, you have been warned!"
1,Overrated and superficial,"The satire is weak, phony, and superficial, and the targets are easy. The book has nothing new to say."
4,A Response to Texans,"I'm from the Lone Star State and am proud to be a Texan. But I recognize that the book is a work of fiction, not a factual representation of highschool kids in podunk Texas. All in all ""Vernon God Little"" is entertaining stuff full of good laughs. For Southern satire, it hardly compares to James Wilcox's ""Modern Baptists,"" however."
5,THE NEXT GREAT TRAGEDY,"BESIDE HAMLET,MACBETH,OTHELLO AND ROMEO AND JULIET WILL BE VERNON GOD LITTLE .VERNON GOD LITTLE IS NOT A SATIRE BUT A SERIOUS TRAGEDY DISGUISED AS ONE BY DBC PIERRE THE TRAIGC STORY OF A BOY WRONGFULLY ACCUSED OF MURDER WHO FLEES TO MEXICO ONLY TO BE ACCUSSED OF MURDER THERE IF THEY MADE THIS BOOK INTO A MOVIE I WOULDN `T BE SURPRISED IF IT ENDED WITH HIM KILLING HIMSELF OR KILLING SOMEONE ELSE THIS IS THE NEW HAMLET"
3,Character Flaws,"The author has ruined a good plot with poorly cast characters who are unconvincing as representing what Texas teenagers are like. The book reads more like science fiction written by a drug addled mad scientist than someone who is attuned to today's young folks. The author does turn the occasional good phrase in his dialogue, but the syntax is nothing like I've ever heard in this country. Still in all, it's an interesting read."
1,Could have been great...,"I was very disappointed at the over use of profanity. It was rampant and unnecessary. Personally, I wasn't able to get past it and it took away from what could have been a great story."
1,Who's Become the Cliche?,"Let's see, con man writes first novel capitalizing on human tragedy and gross stereotypes of American society. Book is unoriginal rip-off of numerous well-known and far better executed examples of the genre. European elites read book which confirms all their ignorant misconceptions about the US. Elites award him the most prestigious book award to stick to the Americans, again. Has it ever occurred to these people that they've become the cliche?"
3,"Okay book, but don't understand how it won the Booker prize...","I couldn't sympathize with the main character and at times the writing was difficult to get through. I have really enjoyed other booker winners and runner ups, but i still don't understand how this won. I kept waiting for the great plot point and never reached it. The issue addressed was bold but badly delivered, though i did enjoy the humor in it. All in all, I would recommend others to give it a miss."
1,Life is too short,"Call me dumb if you like, but I found this book to be one of the most unfunny, unreadable nonsense I have attempted to plough through in a long long time.OK so its supposedly a commentary of American life etc etc etc., but please, take my advice and give it a big miss. Poorly written with veiled failed attempt to be hip as per Catcher in the Rye. Not enough hours left in a life to waste them trying to finish rubbish such as this."
2,Ho-hum,"Despite its award-winning status, Vernon God Little is a minor effort. It held my interest and even made me laugh out loud on a number of occasions, but great literature this is not. I didn't really even see it as all that scathing an indictment of American society, at least not in terms of it breaking new ground. If an American had written the book, I'm sure there would have been less uproar.The characters are over-the-top Texan stereotypes, none of them fleshed out, and the plot is pedestrian at best. Still, Vernon as narrator has an engaging voice and manages to evoke a certain dread regarding the outcome of the events described."
2,"Funny, but not THAT funny","I'm not familiar with the criteria by which the Man Booker prize is awarded, but I purchased this book on the assumption that it would be ""funnier than The Simpsons"",""a showpiece of super comic writing"" according to the reviews on the back cover. This is far from being the case. I believe that what other reviewers have said regarding stereotypes of Texans and Mexicans is a valid criticism of the story, and it disappoints in not being nearly as funny as we are lead to believe. Giving prominent mention to human excrement? Playing on stereotypes of grammatically challenged rednecks? Over use of a slightly modified version of the four letter f word? At least no one can accuse the writer of being sophisticated in his 'humour'"
3,Don't Bloody Care Pierre!,"On the plus side, there are some great jokes and some marvellous bits of wordplay. The negatives are the slightly tired stereotypes of Americans and the VERY tired descriptions of Mexico. I also found the ending rushed and a little too neat. I certainly enjoyed reading the book (it's a 21st century Catcher in the Rye) but I wouldn't bother re-reading it and will probably never think about it again."
1,I must be missing something,"It's obvious that I must have a screw loose considering how everyone on this page seems to be hailing ""Vernon."" Right now, I find myself cursing my book club for selecting this irritating and frustrating garbage. Are these characters meant to be gross caricatures or is that just accidental? Is any of this supposed to be believable? Could a 15-year-old from a backwater town possibly have these profound insights into the human condition? And could this book, which has won the Booker Prize, possibly stand the test of time? I think not."
1,Trainers????,"If you want an idea of exactly how contrived the Pierre's dialogue is, try to imagine what Trainspotting would have been like if it had been written by a Southern California Valley Girl.If this guy really had to write a book about school violence, why didn't he set it in his own country (or, at the very least, in a country he had lived in)?"
1,The Joke's on Europe,"European authors with disturbing penchants for generalization and stereotypically ridiculous premises regarding America should stick to writing about what they know best: old, tired, vacuous Europe.If Mr. Pierre and his ilk ever actually visited America, they certainly never left their Swissotel Boutiques. Entertaining? Maybe. Profound? Please. That this book won the Man Booker just shows the currently fashionable European fetish for celebrating all things anti-American."
4,"great, rollicking read","When all is said & done, this book has much more depth than one initially imagines. It's a fun, easy read & very thought-provoking."
3,"Big style, little story","Story of a Texan teenager implicated in a high school massacre sounds like heavy drama but Pierre makes light work of it - it's an exciting ride while it lasts, though it doesn't end up anywhere. Protagonist Vernon is one of life's born losers and after being falsely accused events rapidly escalate from the alarming to the downright bizarre.Pierre gives Vernon a startlingly original voice, full of slang and sardonic humour and a kind of naivety, and he does some amazing tricks with words. But the characters mostly exist on the level of caricature and for all the hi-jinks not enough story happens to satisfy."
2,Potty Mouth attacks again,This item would probably not have been published if Stephen King had not hit the big time with his other novels. This is a loose collection of mostly obscenities and nasties with a little gore to glue it together. It appears to be a test project for future novels.I will not go too much into detail as each incidence relies on surprise. However we start out with a normal small town. Bizarre events eventually turn into a surrealistic nightmare. People are trapped in a twilight zone type of atmosphere and the question is if anyone will survive? It does not look possible.Desperation
4,ENCOURAGING WORDS FOR YOUNGSTERS,"Everyone needs a little encouragement from time to time, and that's exactly what young hearts will find in this tale of Carlin, a timid racoon, who is skittish about everything - trying new things, sounds in the night, and even his own shadow.Fortunately, Carlin has a good friend, Zack, who takes the cowering creature to Big Bear, ""the bravest animal in all the land."" Big Bear tells Carlin that the soup he is preparing, Bravery Soup, will banish all fears. Problem is, one extremely important ingredient is missing and Carlin must go after it.Poor shuddering Carlin, he ""must go alone through the Forbidden Forest to Skulk Mountain,"" and then into a cave in which a box is hidden. With knees shaking and lips trembling Carlin sets out.The little fellow learns many important lessons along the way, and so will all who read this reassuring tale.- Gail Cooke"
3,Not as Helpful as I Hoped,"If you have used any of the Strategy Guides for Might and Magic 6 through 9, you know how complete they are with information about quests, items, monsters, and game play - enough in fact, so that even a beginner can finish the game with a minimum of frustration. Unfortunately such is NOT true of this Guide. It does have maps which are fairly good, and information about spells and monsters which is sometimes helpful, but almost nothing about game-play or Quests or how to navigate the frustrating areas.If you are as foolish as I was, and decide to buy the Older M&M; 1-5, this is better than nothing. But I really recommend that you invest your money elsewhere. The games DO NOT work on modern computers, and even on our old one that runs Windows 98 (that we keep in the spare room) only #3 loaded.All in all - the Games and the Guide were a BIG disappointment."
5,Help is on the way,If you need help this book with help you through many if the trials and tribulations. Go ahead you need help!
2,Where's MM I & II?,"The book clearly states it's from MM I to V...For the 3, 4, and 5, they cover every map, every monster, etc.For the 1 and 2, there's a single paragraph telling the backstory of the MM world.I bought it just for the latter two, so I was just deceived, frustrated and angry."
4,The Battle of Hattin,"Probably not even a third of this volume actually discusses the climatic Battle of Hattin (4 July 1187 AD) - most of the text is devoted to describing the organization of both armies, and the book is concluded with one of the better accounts I have encountered of Salah al-Din's siege and capture of Jerusalem - as is portrayed, fairly accurately in the movie `Kingdom of Heaven'. Nonetheless this is a valuable book for anyone with a particular interest in the Crusader era, and it is supplemented by numerous photographs, several Angus McBride paintings of the contemporary Islamic soldiers, and three bird's eye view maps of the battlefield and troop movements."
1,Wrong Order,"The company sent me the wrong mousepad, so I sent it back. They promptly replaced it--with the wrong one again."
2,Just OK,The wrist rest is to hard and the mousepad is small. I did not like it and returned it to Amazon.
1,Doesn't Stop Wrist Pain,"I have been using the mousepad daily at work for about 4 months.The mousepad looks really nice, doesn't smell funny and I don't have any issues about size.Howvever, I still get pain in my wrist and find the only way to get rid of it is to change the side I'm using the mouse on. Previously at work I had a joystick looking mouse (so your wrist in in a totally different position)3M Ergonomic Mouse, Optical, USB/PS2 Compatible, Large Size, Black (EM500GPL)- this gave me no pain but is a bit embarrasing to use. I would recommend not buying this product but buying a joystick mouse (couldn't find one when I bought this but I now see Amazon is selling the 3M ergonomic mouse). Latest workplace assessments in NZ don't reccommend using the mousepad with gel rest but the ergonomic mouse."
2,Bad quality,Great for around 4-6 months of heavy use. Then the top plastic piece on the mousing surface starts to separate from the gel plastic base. This is the second one I've bought - I suppose you can't expect too much from a $13 product.
2,Buy if you don't care about quality,"Bought this for less than a month and the plastic is starting to peel off. When I first got it, I thought there was a plastic film over the gel pad but it turns out that's just the coating. The gel wrist rest isn't too bad but this plastic sheet on the mousepad is flipping up from the sides. Definitely would not recommend if this sort of issue would bother you."
3,"Great for wrist, bad for optical mouse!","I already have the Fellowes gel keyboard wrist rest and love it, so I thought I would love the matching mouse pad too. However, as other reviewers have noted, this mouse pad does not work well with optical mice. The cursor goes haywire! I tried 3 different optical mice, and each one had the same problem. I love the cushion the mouse pad gives my wrist however, so I put an old mouse pad over top of it so that I can still use the cushion and my optical mouse. If you have an optical mouse, I suggest you buy the mini gel rest (Fellowes Gel Flex Transparent Mini Wrist Rest (Blue Crystal)) instead, which is basically a wrist rest with no attached mouse pad, and use a separate optical mouse friendly pad with it."
1,"Mouse goes crazy, pad unusable","The jell pad feels great but it is of no use because my mouse pointer is unstable.I can't get the mouse pointer to stay still or to move in a straight line. I checked the cord, I restarted the computer, I checked the mouse for driver updates, I checked START, PROGRAMS, ACCESSORIES, SYSTEM TOOLS, SYSTEM INFORMATION, Problem devices and found no issues. I also ran MS Diagnostics. Nothing bad found.I removed the mouse pad just so I could write this review. What good is this pad if it caused my pointer to go wild? Not happy."
3,"This thing was pretty good, until the glue went bad","I've had two of these over the past seven years. I lost the first one in a move, and went to buy another one because I really liked the first one. The second one was okay, until the glue broke down on the pad and the pad part of it started to buckle after about six months of use. It's difficult to roll a mouse across a lumpy surface.The wrist rest part of it is great, and so rather than spend money on another pad, I just wound up cutting off the pad part and keeping just the wrist rest part, and using my optical mouse on the desk surface itself.Unlike other reviewers, I did not have a problem using my Microsoft Optical mouse (which is almost ten years old) on the pad. I also did not have any smell upon first getting the pad.I might have just gotten a dud with this one, as the first one I had was really good, so I can't tell you not to buy this mouse pad. I recommend the wrist rest thoroughly, and the company does sell those by individually."
4,Satisfactory product,"I agree with the other reviews - this product does have an offensive smell which takes a while to wear off. However, I think that the gel wrist rest is the perfect height, and the product has done everything it has advertised. No more wrist pain from my mouse... I'd recommend it to others."
2,"doesn't match the picture, bad quality","First of all, this does not match the picture. I was expecting a very bright, solid blue. Instead I got a very dark blue, and the gel part is translucent. I would have never ordered it if I had seen an accurate picture. Also, this is very poor quality. The mouse pad part is already tearing loose from the bottom part that sticks to the desk(3 days later). Very cheap and not worth the high price.Also, I have a very small optical mouse(the kind meant for a laptop), so this works fine for me; however, if you have a regular-sized computer mouse, I am almost certain that this mousepad would be entirely too small to manuever the mouse around. On a good note, though, the gel wrist pad is very comfortable.This is the only reason that I havn't returned it(that and because it is too much trouble)."
2,I AGREE! False Advertising!,"We have an optical mouse and decided to buy a mouse pad for it. We saw this one and it being a known brand, trusted what it said, ""Optical Mouse friendly"" Well, it's not. It's a big disappointment! It's comfortable to the wrists though."
2,A cushy smelly wonder,"It would be great if this thing did not smell so badly. I want to take it back to the vendor I brought it from. I like the color selections, and I selected purple. However, I think I will die from toxic shock if I continue to use this thing! Yes it smells and it smells badly! Fellowes if you are reading these recommendations, do something about the smell."
3,Fits but wears out.,"Amazon was the only place I was able to find these gliders for my walker. None of the drug stores in my area carry this particular size. However, if you use your walker on concrete while shopping, etc., they will wear out quickly. I have since purchased a four wheeled walker because it was getting too expensive to keep replacing them."
5,Need for Speed .... Walker Caps,"I knew that I'd lost a step or two since the double-hip replacement and the two artificial knees. I just thought that it comes with the territory, until I purchased these Glide Caps. Whoa!! Now, when they put the fresh tapioca pudding out at the Olde Country Buffet, I'm always the first in line. And the ladies notice, too. Life-changing? You betcha."
3,Keep dancing.....,"Good tunes...nothing worth noting on this cd compilation. This series has better volumes. If you're a collector of TAZMANIA compilations, then pick it up...otherwise this cd is nothing to get all hyped about."
5,great stuff!!!,I especially like number 7 Rhythmcentric. That girl can sing. I hear she's from Illinois. Well take it easy all you crazy kids out there in freestyle land!
3,Classical Music CD,"Very poor analog to digital conversion. I have the record as well, same recording, sounds so much better. I would have sent this back, but just not worth the effort and cost."
4,OK Dividers,These dividers don't work very well with wire shelving units. Although I was able to add a chunk of wood to stabilize the divider. I'm sure they would work so much better with wood shelving units. I would buy more.
2,Good but not great,These dividers are sturdy and fit over a 3/4 inch shelf. That's the good news. The bad news is they are only 8 inches high. That's not much help in stacking several sweaters or jeans.
5,Helps me organize,Helped tidy up the house. Simple and easy to use. Works great. It was a gift for my mother and she has put it to use.
4,Bible condemns other religions????,"The above review made me more determined to order and read this book. ""Misses the mark"" has missed the whole point. What Stackhouse intended to focus on was just this sort of arrogant, superior attitude demonstrated by misses the mark's review. As Christians we are no where told to condemn other religions but to be examples (humble ones at that!) of those who have been saved by grace...the same grace available to all people, including those in other religions. Hmmmmm didn't Jesus say:""I have not come into the world to condemn it but to save it."" Stackhouse presents a view of apologetics that is closer to the heart of Christ than many other self-righteous arrogant apologetical works."
4,I Love Lavender,"I love this shower gel, nice fragrance, lovely feel on the skin. I would like more lavender fragrance, but for the low price, this was an excellent choice. Very fresh and clean smelling."
3,This picture is misleading,"When I ordered for this shower gel, I though I'm gonna get the same that is shown in Picture. But let me tell, I didn't. So, I say change this misleading picture and put the true one instead. Because there is a huge bottle size difference between two."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS NOW CRAP,"THIS COMPANY USED TO HAVE A GREAT SMELLING PRODUCT, NOW IT IS CRAP. I CALLED AND ASKED WHAT HAPPENED, AND THEY SAID THEY CHANGED IT TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR THE EARTH. I THINK THAT'S BULL AND THAT THEY CHANGED IT FOR THEIR BOTTOM LINE TO MAKE MORE MONEY. THE LAVENDER SHOWER GEL ROCKED, NOW YOU CAN'T EVEN SMELL IT HARDLY, IT'S SAD. SOMEONE CONVINCED THEM TO SAVE MONEY AND ALL THEY HAVE DONE IS CHASE CUSTOMERS AWAY. THEY SLAPPED A SIGN ON IT THAT SAID ""NEW WITH MORE ESSENTIAL OILS"". YEAH RIGHT, MORE ESSENTIAL OILS THAT ARE CHEAPIFIED AND WORTH NOTHING WHICH MAKES THEIR PRODUCT A FLOP. WHOEVER SUGGESTED THEY CUT THE WONDERFUL FRAGRANCES DOWN TO WHERE YOU CAN'T SMELL IT, THEY SHOULD FIRE THAT PERSON IMMEDIATELY. SO PATHETIC THIS PRODUCT IS NOW. AND I'M SORRY TO DRONE ON, BUT I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR PEOPLE AS GIFTS, ALL SORTS OF STUFF, AND NOW LOOK AT THIS, IT SUCKS."
2,Packaging issues,"When I opened the box, I saw that some of the soap was spread in the box and all over the bottle.That's disappointing.It was apparent that it wasnt packaged properly to endure the trip. Please do better."
1,Something's Changed,"I've used and loved this product for years, but the latest bottle I received smells off. I don't know if the product itself changed, or if the gel is just spoiled. At any rate, I can't use it, and since I've opened it, I can't return it. I'll find another use for this, and I won't order it again. Sad."
4,Nice...,"Very faint scent, which is fine with me - probably healthier, too...more natural? Smooth, silky, does the job of a bath gel. Rinses clean, as far as I can tell. Buying on sale convinced me to give it a try. I love the matching skin lotion - not too thin or too thick, and not sticky after it's absorbed. Very nice."
1,"Took away lemony smell, they get F-","This product used to smell so great when using it to wash up or shower, now it's just blah. It used to smell so good I'd buy them for everyone I knew just about, now it's grade F-, no good at all.The entire area you used it at used to smell amazing, now they have this note on it saying""MORE SUSTAINABLE"", but seems to me someone convinced them they could save big money by taking out the very thing that makes it attractive, so now all their loyal customers are going bye bye, I know I am. If anyone can point me to a body wash that smells great like lemon, give me a ring, thank you."
1,shrink,This product was not true to size. After the first washing they were so small they slid right off your heel. Buyer beware on this one
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"While the purchase price was only $5 at the time I made the purchase, I am disappointed in the fact only 1 pair actually had the ""daisey"" design on them and the other 5 pair were plain white.I don't remember reading this information at the time of purchase. I notice since ordering the price has now gone up.Overall...The socks are comfortable."
3,Interesting........,"Well to begin with, this is not at all the sock I ordered. The ones I ordered were 'lettuce' and the other 'daisy'. I was very disappointed though to find that only ONE pair of each design actually had the design on it. I doesnt read that way in the description, or I would not have ordered them. But other than that they are fine."
4,First 1 minute silence to honor 9-11 families of casualties,"Now,Let it out.Is this rock - yesIs this jazz - yesIs this funk - yesIs this prog - yesIs this space- yesIs this Kraut- you bet.If you like any of above categories,with a twist,and great musicianship,,,there you go, best stew around.This is from 1975 and is as good today as it was then.In Germany that year these guys dominated polls (well almost),like E,L&P; did in their heyday.Great cover too.Scratch your head and multishaped dandruff floats off into the sky-love it.Need more help with Kraan reviews,please check www.progarchives.com"
2,Not worth the investment,"Save your money, just get the papers on the subject published by the authors in the Journal of Solid State Circuits. There is not really enough material for a book. To extend the discussion from CMOS oscillators to ALL oscillator design is a bit of a stretch. Other materials (i.e. GaAS, InP) exhibit different phase noise characteristics."
