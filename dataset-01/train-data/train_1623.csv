3,Prophecy and Calamity,This book is about the prophecy's of 2012. There is a lot of calamity in these prophecies and this could scare some readers. It has a lot of Earth change prophecies and talk about the changing of the age. It was interesting
1,Narcism runs wild,This guy is a total joke... in one breath he rips into Einstein as someone who was clueless about astrophysics and then turns around and informs how the same Einstein supported his views. Can't have it both ways buddy... might want to insert some actually facts to support those broad claims. Save your money!!!
2,Entertaining,"I am an avid study of ancient history in all aspects of all civilizations. I read this book and thought I was on crack.. There are plenty of books on real and factual studies of this nature and this guy spins the best mushroom tasting fantasy yet.I did and was entertained by this book, but he takes real data and warps it out into space.I laughed more than thought on this reading, but hey we all need entertaining."
2,skip some of this,"Read part I (4 chapters) then read part IV then close the book. In the rest of this book the author goes on forever about how excited he was to discover all this and then shows the same boring mathematical stuff over and over and even has a part where he plays teacher goes over it number by number. Showing some of this math is ok to a point, to make the point, but this went on into meaningless babble."
5,TSUNAMI IN ASIA! TIDAL WAVE CHAPTER!,"WOW! I READ THIS BOOK A WILE BACK, THE REAZON IM PUTING A REVIEW TILL NOW IS BECAUSE AFTER THE TRAGEDY THAT HAPPEND IN ASIA ON DEC 26 2004 (R.I.P. to all the inocent victims) THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MY MIND WAS THAT CHAPTER OF THAT BOOK!IF U HAVEN'T BUY THE BOOK BUY IT NOW, READ THE ""TIDAL WAVE"" CHAPTER AND TELL ME IF AFTER SEEING THE TSUNAMI INCIDENT THAT MAN DON'T MAKE SENCE! IT DOES AND ALOT!"
4,Very Illuminating,"If you will notice the rating in the reviews of this book will either be 1 or 5 stars but no in-betweens. THis is perhaps do to the polarizing nature of the subject and the many fears that people tend to harbor. I found this book to be very illuminating and a confirmation to something that I already knew from either other sources or from pure insight. But regardless of the numerous reviews here nothing can take away from the fact that the Mayan calendar ends in the year 2012? Coincidence? THe book was not written for a scientific journal, so it does sound speculative at times, but once you read and understand the implications and the sources from which the authors have drawn their data, it is highly illuminating."
1,Cataclysmically dismal!!,"This book is essentially a self-important book report! The auuthor has perused several touchstone books in the realm of alternative science, specifically those having to do with end times prophesies, cataclysms, and pole shifts! Notable among these are works by Hapgood, Bauval, and Flem-Ath!Do yourself a favor, read the originals! This book adds nothing new to the discussion! Rather, it serves as a ""book report"" on the work of others, presented in breathless style, with 15 exclamation points on every page! What is up with all the exclamation points?! I could have lived with less punctution and more, I don't know, ideas! Since I've read most of the books this reports on, it was ultimately pointless!Start with Charles Hapgood and the Flem-Ath book, When the Wky Fell!"
3,It's Better Than Nighttime Tylenol,"In The Orion Prophecy Patrick Geryl & Gino Ratinckx deal with Maya & Egyptian prophecy. Looking over of these reviews, some of these folks must not be well read. These authors have not made any claims that others have not from today's Hal Lindsey, Gordon Scallion, Art Bell, to yesterdays Edgar Cayce, Nostradamus, Mayans......The point being if your new to the thought of massive earth changes this book is an OK place to start. However, if your familiar with that train of thought I would suggest skipping it because I really did fall a sleep several times reading it. I didn't even need any Nighttime Tylenol last night. So for that it gets three big yellow yawns (Stars) from me."
1,The Orion Prophecy - Geryl's new religion,"This book is weak. Geryl's anectdotal presentation of the topic, endless hearsay quotes from other sources and lack of real evidence may do well over wheat beers at the veggie bar, but they leave the reader questioning ""where's the beef?"" Oh, that's right, Geryl is a starvation vegetarian. That is also one of his ""laws"" he wants to enact in the unlikely event that anyone survives his imaginative world ending. He's good with numbers too. Let's see, there are 264 pages in this book. If we divide 264 by the 12 zodiac signs, we get 22. I then subtract the extra 5 days of the ancient 365 day calendar from 22 and get 17. Hey - that's the retail price of this book $17. Look it's right here on the label. Amazing isn't it? Save your time and your money. Find another book on the 2012 Maya/Egyptian topic. There are plenty of good alternatives."
1,Waste of My Money,"I knew I made a mistake in buying this book when I read the first sentance: ""I am writing this book out of sheer anger, despair, and misery."" The author, Patrick Geryl, writes in hyperbole and loosely uses such language as, ""After reading these notes, I was gripped by a terrible fear. Ir's clear that a world disaster of unknown proportions is in store for us."" and ""I felt so desperate I could have killed myself. Luckily I didn't have the time for it, because I had to finish my research first."" He is not a researcher. He is hysterical. I cannot believe such nonsense was actually published and presented as ""new age""."
1,Mayans with welding helmets,Along with the 53-1 (one returned the book) suckers who have read this book it is all based on sunspots that Mayans supposedly used to make their famed stone calendar and predictions.I only have one question? How the hell did the Mayans look at the sun without protection??? Did they close their eyes and looked?This is a scientific phenomena and it is called GUESSING!!! In case ya didn't know!
1,SPECULATION WITHOUT A BACKBONE,"some people like theories and speculation. but when it comes to something like this, in order to make these assumptions credible, there needs to be some form of solid evidence presented.geryl failed to do this. what we are left with is simple creativity and a few bits of 'proof' that just happen to fit his theory. NOTHING solid.i need solid evidence for a claim this big. otherwise it's just fantasy to me.however, if you like to dream and get all excited over things like this without even a shard of solid evidence, then this is for you.the rest of you, don't waste you time."
2,End of humanity,"I was very dissappointed, after all this writer have done to research and compile the history and future or ""possible"" future of humanity.He forgot to mention one of the most important details about the ancient knowledge of the Egyptians and Mayas, the ""Photon Belt"", if we understand this we will understand the message, and the change our planet and our selves are going to experience.We don't need more negative news, we have to focus in our heart and not only in mathematics and calculations, they all end up at cero if we want."
3,Duh,"Everyone knows the end will come from the Orcs and the Eye of Saruman, not some made-up-fairy-tale-dungeons-and-dragons b.s. like Atlantis. Get with the program people."
1,who ever wrote this is mentaly challeneged,the world isnt gonna end until 40 billion years. Please people do not be alarmed by this book it is all a fake and a trick to scare you
1,Who wrote the Editorial Review????,"The Book Description states as fact that the world will end in 2012 according to Mayan and Egyptian ""prophecy."" It goes on to discuss Atlanteans as if everyone agreed they existed. Oh. And it describes Venus as a star.Nowhere is there any sort of caveat such as ""the book alleges"" or ""according to the authors.""I have no problem with people buying and reading this fatuous tripe. It is our right. I wouldn't really care if a customer review clearly took pseudoscience as a given. However, this does not constitute a ""Book Description."" And, no, given that some of us have an ongoing tendency to gullibility it isn't enough to say, ""Well, that's implied.""I have no doubt that 0 out of 3,000 people will fail to find this review helpful. I don't particularly care so you needn't feel so satisfied when you click on that button."
1,Absolutely Amateurish and Devoid of Any Concept of Reality!,"This is one of the worst examples of alternate history. First, it relys on false propaganda disguised as history, not the least of which is a ""trial"" based strictly upon circumstantial evidence, etc. and no fundamental basis in law (the Nuremburg ""Trials""). Secondly, any notions that the witnesses in his trial actually would have seen anything to testify about that he claims they would be testifying about is absolutely preposterous!"
1,Not worth it,"The book was a large disappointment, there was not really much explanation of much. All of the pages except maybe for the first 15 were nothing but lists of titles of stellae and consonants stuck together with no details about them, no explanation or understanding."
3,Binoculars,"They're ok, but not comfortable to use. Too compact, in my opinion. Good seller, though - prompt."
1,Two Thumbs Down,I would have put 0 stars but you have to have at least 1. It has almost nothing to do with the animorphs story and the end was the worst part when you found out what really was in Zone 91 which is a Spoof of Area 51. Also I hated all the uneeded parts in it! The horse race? The part when they were found in the Zone? And the part with the cockroaches!? I hated it. (But I do recomend the other Animorphs books)
1,I cant stand this,"I cant stand this.. it was my first ever animorphs cos i liked the cover because im a horselover.. but this really puts animorphs down. Pointless mission,and K A, ur got ur reasources wrong. First of all horses arnt dumb, and many horses Hav opened ther stable doors, and horses hav a blind spot straight infront and behind. This book is alsolute rubbish... dont even waste ur money"
2,Utterly Pointless,"I think that this was very possibly Applegate's worst book. At first it has you interested, but in the end it isn't even funny,Nothing significant happens either. this was the last book in this series I bought, the plot is redundant and boring after the first 10 books. Don't waste your money."
5,Cool!But not quite 10.,"This is so cool.It is hugely funny.Zone 91 is cool.It is so funny when the found out what the ""ship"" really is.K.A. Applegate has written a spendid book.Exquisite.Will hook you to the dramatic ending.I recommand this book for all ages.Will make you want to read it again and again.It is also very funny.For those who love humor this book is for you.Perharps it is not as dramatic as some of the other excellent books but it is a masterpiece."
4,The Unknown is the funniest book!,"The Unknown wins my award for the funniest Animorphs book ever written. It is hilarious! It has a dumb story line, but K.A. pulls it off because it is so funny. You should definately read it."
4,The Unknown,I think number 14 in the seris isn't that important.Mainly because they discover an Andalite Toilet that has landed on earth.I think it would be more intresting if Visser 3 knew what it was.
2,Not what I expected,"Mike O Connell is a little too over-the-top for my taste; Jesse Eisenberg was spot on. I was drawn to the quirkiness of it, but was somewhat disappointed. I think I'll have to watch it again. My three friends fell asleep about 1/3 of the way through; a poor testimonial."
2,No need to hit me over the head to make a point,"This movie is a dark comedy and involves eccentric characters, which is my favorite type of movie. But, most of the humor and characters are over the top. The acting and dialogue are very deliberate in trying to be funny and different. I'm not sure what the movie is trying to be. It seems more like it is mocking a Wes Anderson movie. I'd understand if that was the case, but I don't think it was. Overall, two stars."
4,Breaking Protocol,"You've already learned that this was Rex Stout's last book. We take Nero and Archie from Prohibition (in Fer-de-lance) to personal computers, and neither of them ages a day.O tempora, o mores, though. Rex felt that he had to shock us with a plot twist which is telegraphed fairly early (even before this book!) but which still causes chagrin in the faithful reader.But the real payoff comes in the subtle, quiet ending. A substantial break in protocl marks the end of Archie and Nero (at least on Rex Stout's watch). Rex Stout, libertarian, independent thinker and great American, lets them bow out gracefully and more than a little sadly. And Michael Prichard gives a lovely, restrained reading that makes it even more memorable.Is it a great story? No, not especially, but it's a wonderful way to say good bye."
4,This is another terrific Nero Wolfe book,Don't believe them when they say Rex Stout had lost his touch. This is another terrific Nero Wolfe book. I'm sorry that these books are so hard to get ahold of.
3,The last Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe Mystery,"For the die-hard Nero Wolfe fans. The last (original) novel about the over-fed, orchid-lover genius detective and his wise-cracking sidekick Archie. Sadly it looks like the Author was about to start killing the long living characters that populated his stories. Not his best effort, but his last so, a must for Nero fans."
1,Hugely Dissapointing,"I love Rex Stout! I hate this book! I love Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe books so much I have a first addition published in 1949--the year I was born. It is a great story. I've read most all his books... This one, being his last, was slow... slower than normal, full of redundant conversations, and totally rediculous. I couldn't finish it. I will someday but with so many other books out there, I think I can live without knowing who killed the waiter."
2,is this the same author?,"This story, unlike all the other Nero Wolfe stories that take place in the late 30s and early 40s, suddenly takes place in the 70s. The main players act completly out of character from any other Nero Wolfe books, with only superficial references to the fact that ""Nero would never usually do this"" type of comments from Archie. It seemed like it was a copycat author and not up to Rex Stout's name."
1,Not very good - disappointing,"I too am a first time coach, but I have played basketball in school and leagues for a number of years. The video is slow and lacks any real wisdom about the game. There is not enough focus on drills and ways to ""coach"" new players on fundaments. ""Dribbling and Shooting are important"" - Yes, thank you, I got that. How about something a little more indepth? A serious basketball fan could have made something similar. I do not reccomend."
2,sleeves smell awful,"The clear plastic windows of the sleeves emit a strong chemical smell. I bought two boxes; both boxes stank. Maybe if you pay a little more you get the non-stinky kind.You get red, orange, yellow, green and blue sleeves, 10 of each."
5,Sweet SQ,"I have this driving a single JL 12w3d4 (12"" dual 4ohm voice coils) wired in parallel for a 2ohm load and it is perfect. The RMS power for the sub is less than the 647 WRMS that this amp can produce, so I have the gain way down which improves the sound quality because the amp is not driven to maximum output. For the price, I don't think this can be beat. I also have a 7541a (same family) which is 111WRMSx4 driving two pairs of Kappa 60.9cs component sets (2ohms) also with the gain way low and I have to say that for the price, old-school infinity can't be beat."
1,A desperate attempt to save the face of the dead Darwin,"This article from the skeptic is a desperate attempt to save the face of the dead Darwin. Read it if you wish, but do yourself a favor and watch the recent movie, ""Expelled"" as well as reading a few books which critique Darwin's theory such as ""Darwin's Black Box"" by Dr. Mike Behe Whatever you do, don't be left with your head in the proverbial sandbox of skeptical evolutionists like the author of this sincere but shallow article."
4,For the hard-core SF reader,"I became involved with the Drake at the beginning as the story established his love and relationship with his wife, Ana. This was paramount since the rest of the book gets into heavy content. Drake is an unusual hero, a sensitive musician/composer, who must become an expert in many sciences to rescue Ana.This was not an easy book to read. Drake's quest through millennial millennium of time and space are details concocted in the mind of a physicist/mathematician author; words or paragraphs couldn't be skipped if his concepts were to be understood. The author worked with different paradigms, but anchored them in the constants of physics. However, he went beyond my feeble reasoning many times.What kept me going was Drake's love for Ana which carries him through to a final reunion."
3,Want to see the end of the universe?,"An expansion of a short story. A cryo nightmare that leads to the end of the universe. Lots of ideas and interesting, but not totally cohesive."
4,Good for Students and Curious Minds,"I plan to go into forensic science and I figured this would really help me in the future. I love the amimation, it is very detailed. This is a great reference book."
1,The real truth about CHSFL,"The real truth about the Children's Home Society is described in my book ""Orphan, A true story of Abandonment, Abuse and Redemption."" The horrors that took place at CHSFL destroyed the lives of hundreds of innocent little children. No one should praise the works of any organization who destroyed so many lives."
2,Daughter lost interest very quickly,We bought this last Christmas for our 6 month old. She played with it that day and hasn't looked at it since. Our 4 year old however loves it. I consider this to be a waste of money - I'll be lucky if I get $2 for it at a garage sale. (I did find that our daughter liked the traditional drum better!)
2,"Great in Theory, Not so Great in Play","My daughter received this as soon as she could sit up, and she is now almost 2 and still has no interest in it. The only thing she seems mildly amused by is the little star shaped music changer. I'll be packing it away pretty soon here. Kids are different, so the next one may like it, and yours may love it. If you can test one before you buy it, I highly recommend you do so. For now, we're having more fun with the pots and pans."
2,Not so Great!,Yes this toy does shut off too quick. I don't think that it is too loud though. But there really is nothing great about it at all!
2,not pleased at all,i got this toy for my son when he was 8 months old. he looked at it and crawled away. he is now 12 months old and i stil cant get him to touch it he may bang on it 2 or 3 times but then is not interested. i dont think its worth the money..
2,"ADD, not PhD","With this toy, your child is more likely to get ADD than a PhD. (ADD = attention deficit disorder)I see Vegas, not Harvard, as the more likely future for children who play with this obnoxious toy.The toy is bosy and shallow.Sure, it has lights and noise, but only at times with purpose.It's the educational equivalent of cotton candy.Any toy that has to repetitively tell you how fun it is to play with probably isn't. (""Hit the drum, it's FUN!"")I had high hopes for this toy based on the other reviews. Unfortunately, I dislike it so much (my daughter isn't interested in it, either - even the box it came in was more interesting) I'm going through the hassle of sending it back.Spend your money on something else."
1,NOT AS FUN AS IT LOOKS=\,"MY 7 MONTH OLD SON LOVES TO BANG THINGS WITH HIS LITTLE HANDS, AS I WAS AT THE TOY STORE I SAW THE DISPLAY WITH THE LEARNING DRUM, I THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD LOVE IT SO I BOUGHT IT. AS SOON I WE GOT HOME I TOOK IT OUT OF THE BOX AND GAVE IT TO HIM. I TURNED IT ON AND STARTED TO PLAY WITH HIM SO HE COULD SEE AND LISTEN TO THE MUSIC HE DID IT FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES AND PUSHED IT AWAY. SINCE YESTERDAY IVE BEEN GIVING IT TO HIM TO PLAY AND HE PUSHES IT AWAY. HE HATES IT .. ITS GOING BACK TO THE STORE TODAY...."
5,"Play the drum everyone, play the drum!","This is a fun toy! My daughter loved this drum when she was finally able to sit up and play with toys. She is now 20 months old and still plays with it occasionally, although she has more fun turning it off and on. She used the drum A LOT during her earlier months as she was excited to be able to do something on her own. I think what Moms need to realize is that the drum is a tool that introduces the child to ABC's, numbers, and the learning of music, rather than actually teaching them."
2,A little entertaining...,"but hardly a learning toy. My daughter got it for her first Christmas when she was three months. Of course she couldn't play it then, but periodically I'd get it out and she never took much interest in it, other than just to carry it around and occasionally take a whack at it. There are better toys."
2,Not much fun,"This drum has settings for Alphabet, Numbers, and Music. When the baby hits the drum, it will count, or recite the letters of the alphabet in order. Unfortunately, you have to hit the drum quite hard and in the right place in order for it to activate. When my baby and I play together with the drum, she can't hit it hard enough, so I will hit it and I find that even I can't make it work every time I expect it to. My daughter is bored by this toy. I give it points for the sound quality and the variety of possibilities, but it doesn't work as it should."
3,a little disappointed,"just got the drum- was a bit disappointed that a perky kid's voice constantly addresses your kid with rejoinders of ""let's play the drum! yeah! good job! let's do it again! follow me!"" I really just wanted a drum noise, and musical tone noise, and letters and numbers but not alot of repetitive chatter. we'll see what the baby thinks of it."
4,Great fun and educational toy,"I bought this for my daughter when she was about 6 months old. We had noticed she liked to bang on our djembe drums, so we decided to buy her a drum of her own. She learned how to turn it on by pressing the star in just a couple weeks. I love this toy because it has the volume control (a must for parents' sanity), different educational settings (alphabet, numbers, repeating patterns), and turns off by itself. This drum is also very, very durable. I highly recommend this toy!"
2,Yawn...,"I own a lot of LeapFrog products and have been impressed with them all. But this drum is just boring.My son received it for his first birthday and was never interested in playing with it, despite his fascination with the alphabet and numbers. He greatly preferred the Discovery Ball or Phonics Railroad.I saved the toy hoping that my almost one-year old daughter would be interested in it. Not a chance. Even when I sit down with her and try to get her interested she won't give me five seconds of attention.If you are looking for a toy to help teach your child the alphabet, then check out the Discovery Ball."
1,Boring,"I agree with Jill's review. There's only three tunes and it gets annoying after a few hours. I returned the product the next day and spent an extra $10 to get the LeapFrog Learning Table instead. The table also teach numbers, letters, shapes, colors and a few basic word like: up, down, high, low, close, open. Look up this product. It's much more functional and entertaining to easily bored parents and child :)"
4,Fun for babies!!!!,I like Leapfrog products and I bought my baby this drum. It is great for him since he likes to bang on everything!!! This is a great toy for babies.
2,gets bored easily,"My daughter got this toy when she was 14 months old. I can't figure out why she gets bored with it so easily. She won't pay attention to this toy for more than one minute. It's great in concept, but didn't work for us. My daughter is now 2 years old, and whenever I get this toy out, it still does not capture her attention."
2,a little too much ...,"My son got this at about 18 months. Besides turning it on and off and switiching the music styles, he didn't get much enjoyment out of it. It's an extremely ""busy"" toy, constantly playing music or talking, which I think causes more sensory overload than invites interaction. I don't think this is a very good learning toy at all."
2,Not as fun as it would seem,"My daughter received this toy for a present when she was nine months old. Eight months later and she still does not play with it. I believe that it offers her very little chance for mastery and, as a result, she does not like it. The first day she got it she figured out how to hit the drum so that it would make the specified noises. After she figured that out there was really little more challenge and so she moved on.I imagine you would probably be better off buying a cheap drum and singing the ABC's with your child."
1,Drums Away,"My 13 month old got the Learning Drum for her birthday. She rarely plays with it and when she does, it's only for several minutes. We try to engage her in it, but she doesn't seem interested at all in it. While I love the features on it, it seems like wasted money for something that doesn't keep her attention at all."
5,Gotta get it!,"This toy is great. We bought it for our daughter when she was nine months old and at first I was a little disappointed. I let her play with a bunch of toys at Babies R Us and she really liked this one so I bought it but then when I got home she didn't seem interested any more - she would pat it a few times and then turn away. After a little while though, she started pounding on it and hasn't stopped since. She loves the music and she's just discovered the ABC's and numbers which make her go bonkers. This is definitely one of her most favorite toys in the house."
2,Talks too much!,My 1 year old just wants to play the drum but this thing won't let her. It constantly interrupts her with applause and compliments. Very annoying! Look for a simpler drum or give your child a pot and spoon instead.
5,Very cool!,"My 15 mo. old son loves this drum. He drags it from room to room putting on performances for everyone. I love it because it has a volume control (very important) and the music is actually quite enjoyable. Overall, a very good toy."
5,An OK toy,"Overall I'm not thrilled with this toy. It does have salot of different options,learning numbers,letters,or just playing a drum,but it times out way to fast. If the Child takes a break from playing with it it shut off quickly."
2,Save your money,"I brought this for my little girl at 9 months of age. She played with it a few times and then lost interest. Every few months I would pull it out to reintroduce. She just didn't care for it. Save your money and use an old pot and wooden spoon!! Take if from a teacher, these toys that they sell as educational just cost more but are not better!"
3,"""Hit the drum. It's Fun!""","The drum doesn't make drum sounds. It constantly interrupts playing with little sayings encouraging more banging, and not much variety in the messages or sounds it does make. The light-up letters on the face of the drum are probably educational, but as a parent, I would prefer he use his pokey sticks on a real drum. However, he does like it (my son is 1 year old and has had the toy for a couple weeks)."
4,"Good Idea, but gets old quickly","Although my daughter has had some fun with this on and off, this hasn't been as good a toy as I thought it would be for the price. There are four settings, but she seems to tire of it quickly. What I tire of quickly is the annoying voice that chimes in everytime she stops banging it for a few seconds (""More! More!"") Also, the music can get a little grating, even with the volume on the lower setting. This is a pretty good toy for kids who like to bang on things and make noise, but the baby and I both agree that five minutes of it is enough!!!"
3,My Son Really Likes to Bang on Things,"My son loves to bang on things so I bought him this drum figuring it would satisfy his need to bang and be educational in the process. He likes it a lot!!! He bangs bangs bangs away and the voice says the letters. The only part of the drum that I dont like is that my son is at the age where he's easily bored, so sometimes when he's playing with it he'll stop for awhile and move on to something else. When it's inactive it turns off, and the only way to get it back on is to switch it to the off switch and back on again. So when he goes back to play with it, He gets frusterated and I have to come over and put it on for him, sometimes he'll have gotten so frusterated that he just decides not to play with it anymore. Otherwise, He enjoys it"
1,drum falls flat,"So far my 8 month old is not interested in this toy. She has had it for about 2 months. She watches the light patterns if I hit the drum but doesn't make much effort to hit it herself. One big pet peeve is the grammatically incorrect ""... or go slow."" A learning toy should not teach poor grammar!"
2,Not worth it!,We got this for our 1.5 year old son. He had such a hard time hitting the drum to make the letters appear. It is also hard to see the letters on the top of the drum. He spent more time throwing it then playing with it!
5,My 9 month old daughter's favorite toy,"We all love this drum so much...she doesn't like to be strapped on the car seat or high chair or play for more than 5 minutes in her playard, but everytime she gets fuzzy we give her the drum and she just stays there playing it. She just loves it. Highly recommended !!"
4,"not ""age appropriate""","the toy itself is great, but i think they should up the age on the box by maybe 2 months. my son is 6.5 months old and has a hard time getting it to make much noise b/c it takes so much pressure to get it to play. he knows where to hit, just can't hit hard enough."
4,play the drums everyone,My daughter loved it when she was 5 months and she still plays with it at 20 months. The tune will eventually drive you nuts so set it at the lower volume.
2,Not the best for 1 1/2 to 2,"I got this toy for my younger cousin, and she only played with it until she was 1 1/2. After that, she wanted to run around and play with things that move! 2 stars ** surely!"
2,eh-no big deal,"My daughter (who is almost 11 months) doesn't seem all that interested in this toy. She got it a few months back, and we thought maybe she just wasn't old enough for it. She's never played with it for more than a minute at a time. It shuts off too quickly, and honestly, I think the voices sound kind of freaky. She loves to bang on her other drum, on pots and pans, but this drum just doesn't hold her interest."
4,Fun toy,"I bought this toy when my son was 6 months old. He didn't really like it at that time, but now that he is 8 months old he loves it. I agree that there could definately be a better variety of the ""songs"" on the drum. They do get tiresome. Overall it is a good toy with lights and you don't have to hit it too hard or exactly in the middle to make it work."
4,How fun is this?! :),"We just got this for our 2-weeks-from-1-year-old today and he loves it! It has 4-5 different functions, from ABCs to music to numbers and he loves banging on it! Anyone who says it's a waste of money is nuts! It's also neat because it shows all the letter and numbers in lights under the head of the drum! My baby likes to take his empty bottles and sippy cups and use that to bang on it! It's too fun to watch, he just loves the thing. I highly recommend it, it's well worth the $20. The only thing I'd say is don't get it if your youngster is under 8-9 months, or at least until they can sit up. I've seen where people buy it for their 5 or 6 month old and then complain that their kid hates it. They just need to be old enough to understand it.Love it! Buy it! :)"
4,Good for those learning to sit,"We received this as a gift for our son when he was around 5 1/2 months and starting to sit alone. He really enjoyed it initially and I like the fact that it would respond to his thumping even if it was upside down or on it's side.However, I do agree that it turns itself off way too quickly and it is a tad repetitive."
5,My 11 month old loves this drum...,Since she always likes to beat on tables and such I bought her this drum and she loves it when it lights up and says the numbers. Even with her little 11 month old hands she can hit the drum and it works! It is a great toy and it is durable.
4,Drum Smarts,When I first saw this toy I thought it would be a great buy. It is very educational learning with different music and lights the ABC's and 123's. But if your child like to move around alot I dont recommend it..
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT TOY,"My son loves this toy. I am very happy with it. The lights, the music, the letters, the numbers. It is outstanding. He can bang on that drum for hours. He loves the sounds it makes so he will bang and bang away. What is especially great about this toy is that he throws it around and it is still working. He is too young to learn things from it but he does the music. I recommend this toy to any mom who doesn't mind her child to be kept busy while she finishes some at home chores."
5,Music And Fun For Little One,"My son just turned 2 and I got him this and he loves it.I think it captivates young minds that already are musically inclined.It's a great cause and effect toy and with this said I think that it is good for kids that can entertain themselves well.If your kid is the type that would rather sit back and be entertained this may not be the toy your looking for, but if your kid likes interactive toys he/she will probally take to it. Besides that it's eye-catching to my baby that loves lights;It has a few different modes... teaching the alphabet, counting to ten, playing the drum,and musical sounds.If your kid likes to bang on things and be noisy then he/she will probally like it."
4,OK so far,"I really like this, however my 6 month old just uses it as a prop to sit up with right now... I think she will grow to love it, it just hasnt been an instant hit!"
2,Didn't hold interest,We gave this to my daughter for her 1st birthday. She hit it maybe twice and then wasn't interested. she's now 2 and has played with it maybe three times. My four year old has played with it about twice also. Would probably be an educational toy if they would play with it.
3,"I love it, my son hates it",My son got this as a present. At first he enjoyed hitting it but then it started to annoy him. I tried to get his interest in it again later by playing with it myself. He will drop whatever he is playing to come across the room to turn it off. I think the tune it plays is cute and upbeat but apparently he doesn't agree. I eventually gave it away.
5,Learning Drum,What a great toy. My son is able to play and learn. Easy for him to turn it on and off and switch to the different features at 8 mts. (Also has a volume control button). Our nephew at almost 2 years responded great to the Learing Drum. Would recommend to anyone with a busy little one.
1,The Most Annoying Toy! Ever!!!!!!!!!!!,"My son received this as a Christmas present. It's basically an annoying advertisement for Leap Frog. It shuts off too fast and constantly says, ""Thanks for learning with Leap frog"" when it does shut off. If it didn't say that all the time, I'd say it is am okay toy. My son is in a hitting things phase and it is a nice appropriate toy to hit, but it shuts itself off before he has a chance to hit it again and I have to reset it for him.In summary.. This is what makes it annoying.- Advertises Leap Frog too much- Shuts off too soon- Must reset it for your child"
5,Great fun for seven month old,"I picked this little drum up for my grandson and he really loves it. He has a little plastic baseball bat that he bangs on it with and since he's at the age of noise and bangs he has a great time. He enjoys the music and also he likes to listen to the voice talk to him.. It's very durable, he likes to stand on it in the playpen to get a better view. I also like the idea that I can lower the sound and the lights are also intriguing. I'd recommend it highly as I feel he will probably even enjoy it when he gets a little older so he can learn to follow the pattern of beats."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"My 9 month old son loves to bang things, but for some reason, he gets bored with this almost as soon as he starts playing with it. I love Leapfrog toys, and this one has such high ratings, I am surprised it's not a bigger hit. The only thing I can figure is maybe he doesn't like the kid's voice shouting the letters (I know I don't). Plus, it turns off much too quickly and there is no way a baby can reactivate it unless he happens to hit the star button in front. It would be nice if you could re-activate it by hitting it, but that doesn't work.My son prefers the LeapFrog Discovery Ball. It has really helped him learn cause and effect. He loves spinning the ball. Plus, it has a volume control and can also be re-activated easily by spinning the ball. In our house, it definitely is superior to the Learning Drum."
4,Mother vs Daughter review,"My daughter would give this toy a 10 out of 5. She loves it that much. I'd give it a 4 on education, agreeing with the review that said that you have to learn to pause to hear each letter. I'd give it a 0 if I was rating annoyance. My daughter turns it on and will march into every room holding in the 'star' button that makes it do a demo song. She won't let the song get 5 secs and she hits it again. So it's like a broken record. I'd give it a 5 on durability as I would anything that lived through my daughter and nephews wrath. My daughter did learn some letters from this and learned how to count to ten, which is a blessing for us because she is a special needs child and we have problems getting through her 'wall' and into her world of learning. This way, she learns while having fun."
3,Ok toy but used it only a few times,The learning drum is a good toy in theory however my daughter showed little interest in it. She did hit it a few times but then lost interest. VERY durable but tips easily when child is playing with it. Ok for the value
3,not the best for my son,"I thought my son would love this toy since he loves banging other stuff, but he really hasn't paid much attention to it. And when he does play with it, it doesn't keep his attention for long. I think it has great songs, but as far as being a great learning toy, there are better ones out there."
4,thought is would really interest a 13 month old,"This is a cute toy. Everything works! It just didn't hold my 13 month old, son's attention. I thought that he would like hitting something, he didn't."
3,Good price,"I got this on sale at Target for $17.99, my daughter played with it the whole way to the checkout line and then decided when we got home it wasnt fun anymore. I think she was around 7 months when we got it, now at 14 months she seems to be a little more intrested in it. She knows how to turn it on and she also knows how to change the tunes."
1,no thank you!,This toy is loud and obnoxious. Anyone who buys this as a gift is sure to get mean thoughts from the child's parents. There is no educational value as the words are hard to hear over the music.
1,Learning drum,"This toy is actually quite annoying. No matter where you touch it, so much as move it a little, it starts to light up and make noise. I truly don't see the learning value in this toy. It make be cute for very young children, but it's annoying to their parents."
3,Volume is loud and louder!,"We got this toy as a gift. My son moderately enjoys it. It turns off quickly (he walks away for just a minute and it's off already) and the volume is unbearably loud. It says it has volume control, but I suppose they mean from loud to louder. The voices that promt you are irritating also but at least they are real voices and not computer generated ones.It sure it durable though. My son has dropped it and it doesn't have any scratches or cracks (and it hurts a lot when it is dropped onto mommy's ankle!!!).Overall, he likes to bang on it and that is about it. The volume is too loud to hear the abc's and stuff to get any educational value out of it. Buy it if your child needs something to bang on and you want to drown out your neighbors. ;)"
2,nice but loud,"Overall a nice toy, we are giving it two stars because of educational value. The thing we don't like is about the limited ability to control volume. There are only two volume control settings, Low and High and the Low seem to be more like medium or high. Preferably, there should be a variable type volume control, the type found on most AM/FM radios or there should be at least one more super low (actually low as low is medium) setting. Also there should be a way to turn volume off and still be able to play just the lights."
3,My 8mth old love's it!,"My 8 mth old son was banging on everything possible so I got him this to pay with. He loves it and bangs it like crazy, buit it dosn't hold his attention as long as some other toys. I like that it has a soft/loud volume control for the days it starts to hurt my head I turn it down!A good buy for the price! The 2 year old I mind here in my daycare also loves it!"
2,Durable...but fun??,I got this toy for my son when he was 9 mos...I found you had to pound it very hard to get it to do anything...he found it was best if he hit it with his binky. I found the talking to be very annoying...it would have been better with just an option for drum sounds or music. He still plays with it from time to time...but he likes the discovery ball much better.
3,"Not sure, maybe he will grow to like it.","My son loves music and instruments. This is too repetitive and the voice is annoying. He has had it for 7 months, he is 16 months old. Until recently he would play it for a minute or two a couple times a week if I handed it too him. He wouldn't take it out of the toy basket himself. At about 14 months he became interested in and will take it at least 4-6 times a week and play with it for a few minutes several times that day. The Neurosmith Music blocks were more exspensive but worth it."
3,A 6 month old can play with this? I don't think so.,"I bought this for my sons 6 month ""birthday."" I thought it would be fun for him since he just reached the ""lets bang stuff on other stuff"" stage. Only he isn't interested in this toy at all. If he does become a little interested in it, it shuts off too quickly if he doesn't bang on it constantly, and without any way of him being able to reactivate it, so he just loses interest again. I can see the potential of this toy as he gets older, just not now. If your going to buy it for your son or daughter, wait until they can walk a little, than maybe it would be fun."
3,OK,"we got this as a gift at 6 mo. my daughter liked it ok, she played with it a little, but quickly got bored. She trys to step on it as a step and it falls over - so be careful. She is 18 months and has forgotten this toy."
3,Fun for a While,"My son enjoyed the drum for a couple of months. Now (at one year old) he seems to get bored with it quickly. Maybe when numbers and letters mean more to him, he'll pick up interest again. However, the background music in at least one of those modes is too loud and repetitive for Mommy!"
3,Not the best LeapFrog product,"My son shows minimal interest in this after owning this for about six months. The lights are unclear when it shows letters and numbers and it tips over constantly, making it hard for him to bang on. It has very little options as far as sounds. I do have to say, it is extremely durable. I could probably stand on it and it wouldn't break :)I would recommend the table instead. That is wonderful!"
2,Not worth it for all kids,"I thought my 7 mo. old would love this toy since she likes to beat on things. She won't hit it at all. I think it scares her, because she won't touch it when it's on. She'll knock it over, but we have a lot of other toys she can do that with (that were cheaper!)."
5,My daughter loves this drum!,"Our daughter loves to bang on items, so we bought this drum for her when whe was 7 months old. She is now 14 months old and she still loves it. This is one of only a few toys that will keep her attention for several minutes. If she walks away, the cheerful voices often recapture her attention. I also like it because it has an on/off switch and it is very portable..just throw it in the car and go. For the price, you can't beat this one!"
2,Holds attention for about two minutes.,"My son got this when he was 6 months old. After he banged on it for a few seconds, he lost interest in it. He's now 13 months old, and he'll bang on it for about a minute, but it doesn't hold his attention for much more than that.What he enjoys most is sliding the settings switch back and forth and hearing the sounds the drum makes on each setting. He reaches for all his books and most of his other toys before this one."
2,wasn't worth the money,I thought this would be great for my son with all the banging. He played with it for about a minute and that was it. It has sat in his room in full view for about 6 months now and I don't ever remember him getting it out to play with. I donated it last week.
1,My child is bored stiff,"I should have listened to the other reviewers who said that their kids became bored with this toy. I thought mine would be different since she seems really interested in the drums in her music class. Not so. This drum bores the heck out of her. At first, she hit it a few times, but the novelty wore off right away. I've had many play dates with lots of kids of different ages (my daughter is 12 months), and this toy holds no ones interest for very long. It doesn't matter if the age is 4 months, 6 months, 9 months, a year, or older. This toy is just plain boring."
3,BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY.....,"My 2 year-old daughter received this from her aunt when she was around 1. She liked to bang on it and quickly seemed to realize the effects of her banging. The buttons on the front were intriguing to her, also, but the drum never held her interest for long. When the child stops banging, an electronic voice urges them on - this had no effect on my daughter and just made more noise. She no longer has much interest in this toy, however, preferring toys more suited to her age - i.e., this drum would be good for 1 year-olds. NOTE to parents: the noise this toy makes will work on your nerves like many of the electronic toys today."
1,This toy is a waste of money,"Let me say that I brought this toy from Toy R Us and I thought this would be great for my son. I brought this when he was five months old and from day one, he was scared of this. I don't know why, but he would not touch it.Now I figured he would like it because he is older, but all he does is pick it up and throw it across the room.I played with toy and I have to say it is very boring."
3,"My seven month old's like ""Whateva...""","My son has to hit the drum pretty hard to get it to work. He's interested for a bit, then he reaches for a book and wants me to read it to him instead."
5,"Great, Durable Learning Toy","We bought this toy for my 12 month old nephew, and he loved it. When I had a daughter, I bought her one at 7 months old. She loved it. She is now 18 months old and still plays with it often. It is still going strong.The drum easily activates the alphabet, counting, drumming, or songs. My daughter learned early to end her drumming on the number, ""10"" or the letter, ""Z"" in order to get a cheer. It is very good to learn numbers and counting, as well as music.We absolutely love this toy."
3,"Quite good, but does it need to be so complex?","This drum can be set to count when hit, to go through the alphabet, to make musical sounds, or even (yikes!) to make a drum sound. This is a little more complex than is necessary and for once it would be nice to have something that didn't make electronic noises all the time. A simple sturdy drum would not stop when the batteries run down, and can always be relied upon to give the right response to the baby's stimulus.Having said that, like other Leap Frog toys, this is well made, and will be fun for your little one to play with. It's a good toy, but it's not really a drum.(BTW An English version is available which says 'zed' instead of 'zee')"
2,Eh.,"My ten month old daughter seems to enjoy this toy and will crawl over to it with the intention of banging on it. I suppose she loves the the fact that it responds when she gives it a good whack. I personally find it annoying. It's one of her more demanding toys. ""Play with me!"" it shouts. ""HIT the drum!"" I wish I could change the music. Actually, I wish it had a setting where it really sounded like a drum: no words, no letters, no numbers, no annoying music, just drum."
3,quickly tiersome,My son got this toy for christmas when he was 14 months old and even though his initial reaction was great he quickly grew bored of it and now he is 19 months old and I hav'nt seen him touch it in about 2 months. as far as its educational value I think the premise it great but the age that my son would have really enjoyed the toy would have been at 6 months when he would have been way to young to grasp any of the alphabet letters anyways. I think the age rating of this toy is way too optimistic that such a simple toy to opperate would keep children up to 2 years old amused for any length of time.
2,Fun for the parents,"I bought this toy for my 1-year old and she didn't like it as much as I did. She would hit a couple of times and the music would keep playing and then she became bored and left it alone. If you leave the toy idle for a few minutes, it just shuts off by itself. That was frustrating for my child and now she doesn't play with it at all.Save your money and buy something else."
5,My 8 month old triplets love it.,My kids love this drum. They learn that they actually can make something happen themselves. They giggle and laugh when playing with this toy. My 2 year old likes it too especially the alphabet and counting part since she's learning the alphabet song. I highly recommed this item.
1,it's a dud,"this toy is really a dud. it would be fun if it worked properly, but if your child doesn't start using it w/in about 30 seconds, it switches itself off & can't be reactivated by the child by hitting the drum. this toy doesn't take into account the short attention span of children in the age range it's designed for. most toys for this age range can be reactivated any time the child starts using the toy. not this one! if mom isn't there to turn it on, my baby gets frustrated that it doesn't do anything & gives up on it."
1,Less Than Impressed...,"The sensor isn't really the drum top it seems, so even the slightest bump on the floor or with a foot registers a ""tap"" on the drum and progresses through the alphabet/numbers.By the time my one year old manages to turn it on (sideways) and than place it on the ground to start drumming, it's usually off into D, E, or F...Plus the music is constant, annoying, and detracts from the kid's ability to focus on the letters or numbers.It quickly switches from the letters/numbers to flashing lights and music if your child doesn't keep drumming - this seems like it would lower any kid's attention span.Interesting concept, poor execution."
5,My little drummer boy,"My son got this for Christmas when he was 11 months old. He was fascinated by the lights on top and the voice that spoke when he hit it. He loved it! He is now almost 3 and we still bring this toy into the ""rotation"" every few weeks. He is hard on things...it has taken several hits on the hardwood floors without any problems. He also likes to beat on it with drumsticks and it has held up well. I love the volume control...a lifesaver after an afternoon of beating on a drum!The toy is still in great shape and we're about to introduce it to our 5 month old son if his brother will share! I am confident that it will hold up just as well for him. As a former teacher I place high value on educational toys. I only rated the value at 4 stars because I'm not sure my son ever learned the alphabet or numbers from playing with this. However, the combination of listening and touching together covers 2 different learning styles and reinforces language. All in all, a great toy."
3,DingoDuo,"We bought this for our 8-month old son. He's now able to hit the drum and will sit and play with it but in all honesty it doesn't hold his interest for very long. The main problem we have with it is that the music is VERY loud and annoying when it is on the alphabet or number setting. I would be much happier if there was no music with these two options--and just the letters/numbers were cited when the drum is hit. I also watch a 20-month old boy -- and he seems to enjoy it, but again only for a short period of time (5 to 10 minutes)."
1,Boring,"My son received this toy as a gift from a friend when he was about 5 months old. He has never been into it. There is even one at his daycare and he never plays with it there either. it is not really interactive. it never caught his attention. it is hard for 6 months old to hit the drum hard enough to make it light up or make noise. i thought maybe he would get into it when he was older, but he is 11 months now and every day he passes it by for other more interactive toys or books. very disappointing from leapfrog. i would not buy this toy."
3,Cute but not great,"Another playing music, counting, abc-ing toy from Leapfrog.Really just wanted a drum with sound effects - getting tired of everything having the same music and alphabet reciting stuff.Too electronic for my taste."
4,Adults enjoy too.,"My daughter received this for Christmas. At first she was not sure about it but, now she enjoys it. I think the adults like it just as much. This is a great toy."
5,Great learning toy with no pieces to lose!,"Young children love to pound on things, especially if it produces a noise. Why not let them pound on something they might learn from! And it's just one piece! It teaches letters and numbers, plays music...you can't go wrong with this one."
1,I hate this thing!,Just another useless noisy toy. It won't shut up when the child is done playing it. It annoys all others around it and plays obnoxious music. I dispise the person that gave this as a gift and can't wait to find a way to dispose of this when my son is not looking. He does like to bang on it but I'd rather give him a spoon and an upside down pot than this piece of . . . .
2,great toy...if it works,"This is a great toy - my noise loving son has a blast with it! When you tap on the drum, it moves on to the next letter of the alphabet or number. However, after a month, our drum quit recognizing when you tap on it. It plays the background music and talks to you but that's all. It's worthless as a learning tool but my son still loves it for the music it plays. There is short warranty (I think 90 days), but I didn't realize this until 6 months later. I tried to see if I could fix it myself but that didn't work. There are many better quality toys out there - I would not recommend spending money on this one."
3,Needs some improvement,"This drum isn't a bad toy, but I wish they had an option to just play the drum, no little songs or clapping or any other sounds except that sound of a drum. My baby just likes to keep hitting this thing, he doesn't listen to the songs or what they are saying (and they get very annoying to an adult after a while!). Luckily I found this at Big Lots, so I didn't pay alot for it. Might be better for an older baby (mine is 10 months)."
2,Boring to my 11mth old but 3 yr old loves it~,"My son recieved this toy for this past xmas. Because we have sooo many toys we waited to bring it out . This toy has been sitting w/ all the other toys in the livingroom and my son has only bothered w/ it maybe 3 times. And that is only usually when my 3 yr old daughter is playing w/ it. This toy seems like a better toy for slightly older kids who have started to learn how to count, and say their abc's. It's just not intresting to my son at all."
4,Hit the Drum...Its FUN!,My son loves this toy. Hes in his banging stage (6 months) and he knows that when he bangs on the drum it will make noise and play music. He really loves this drum.
1,Not So Great,"My 18 month old daughter Veronica recieved this drum for Christmas last year (8 months old). She has always loved banging on things, but she'd rather push the button on the front than beating the drum. This is the worst present that we have ever bought her. She has played with it for a total of 10 minutes since we have had it. I think its a great idea for a toy, but it just won't keep my daughter's attention."
2,Disappointing.,"I was so excited to get this neat-looking toy for my baby. What a disappointment. Though the concept is a good one, the Drum just does too much with too little imput. One pat from the child and it goes on and on... by the time it stops singing, he's lost interest."
2,Buy a real small drum instead of this one...!,"I bought this toy for my then 11-month year old daughter based on the excellent rating from Amazon's customers. This is the right size toy drum for her, but she did not find it amusing. Instead of banging the drum, she preferred pressing the button that allows her to change the music. The music is a little bit ""unusual"" and the voice is so annoying. A couple of years later, this drum is still not interesting for my now 2-year old twins."
3,Cute Toy,Some one gave this to my 4yr old and he played with it for a while but now about 2 months later he just passes it over for for the leap frog alphabet frige phonics! Maybe it would have been better if he had recieved it at a younger age! I just hope that my six month might get a little more use out it!
4,Fun but not too educational,"As another reviewer stated, yes, it is fun but the music does interfere with the learning of the numbers and letters. It is very sensitive and my 5 month old enjoys hitting it and making it make noise. he isn't too sure about why yet but he does like it. I do think they could have made the base a bit sturdier so it doesn't tip as easy as it does. All in all, it is a good toy for them to bang on. ""bang the drum everyone bang the drum"" (gosh is that annoying)"
4,"great toy, but the paint came off with little finger nails","My 10-month old son loves this drum. He knows how to activate it by pushing the yellow star button and can play with it for a long time. My only concern is that when he scratches, and little ones love doing that, the paint on the surface of the drum came off."
1,Curtails free play... poor interactivity,"The behavior of this toy was baffling, until I sat down and played with it myself for a while. On the 'drum' settings [where you can supposedly 'free bang'], it is constantly interrupting with children's voices directing your child to mimic their brief pattern. And no matter if your child gets it correct or incorrect, it's feedback alternates between &quot;WONDERFUL!&quot; and &quot;YOU'RE GREAT!&quot; On 'music', everytime you bang on it, it plays the same notes of the same one short song.Letters and numbers are alright, but the subtlety of their readout on the drum head is surely lost on my one-year old. However she's extremely good at turning it on and off, as it's start up music is the best part as far as she's concerned."
4,Great gift!,"Our 6 month old received this as a gift, at first he just liked to listen to it & watch us hit it, after a few times of that he learned to do it for himself. He has definitely learned cause & affect, meaning, ""when I hit this, if I look at Mom & Dad they are so impressed with me."" I guess some of the music can be a little annoying, I wish there was a little more variety, but it has volume control and enough categories that it keeps it interesting. It is definitely good for someone around his age & up, I think he would be bored with it had he received it at 2 years of age but we aren't there yet to see if he still likes it. We think it is great and really enjoy playing with him on it."
3,pretty good buy it for the older babies,"I bought this for my son when he was 6 mos old and he played with it for a few minutes and it collected dust until he turned 1, and all of a sudden he discovered it again. He plays with it although not that often, when he does he enjoys the music and drum sounds it makes as he bangs it. It has a great premise but not the attention of my son."
3,nice and durable but won't hold attention long,"we have bought tons of Leap Frog toys for our baby and for the price, this is not a bad toy. It is very durable and nice. it is fun for our son to play with for a short time, but never has held his attention for very long. the discovery ball is, I think, a more engaging toy, but this one is still a fairly good choice. just don't expect your baby to spend a lot of time with it and you won't be disappointed."
2,Not for my 6 month old,"I bought this for my 6 month old son. He loves to bang on things and I thought this would be great. It just doesn't keep his attention for more than a minute or two. I wouldn't recommend this for 6-7 month olds, but I can see him enjoying this when he's older."
5,great toy for 6 months up,It's hard to find a toy that a 6 month old enjoys-this toy is great because it takes a movement that they do naturally and makes it fun and rewarding-she is learning that she gets a result when she bangs on the drum-leapfrog does it again!!
3,So-so Toy,"Santa Claus brought this to our daughter for christmas. She was 9 months at the time and at first she played with the drum but her interest in it quickly petered out. Now at 16 months she will turn the yellow button on it on so that it will play the music. All she seems interested in is hearing the different musics. I don't think it does much in the way of teaching her her letters or numbers. It isn't that great a toy. If you are looking for a good educational toy for you little one, go with Leapstarts Learning Table, Discovery Ball or Hug and Learn Baby Tad."
4,Fun toy.,This toy is terrific. My nine month old has been playing with it for two months and its still going strong. She loves banging on things and making music - this toy fits all those requirements!
5,My Einstein Baby,"My 9 Months old daughter get's bored easily. Which means, she observes her surrounding more often now. At this stage I noticed she wants to play adult gadgets, like real car keys, boombox, cellphones and our computer keyboards. Plushy toys are too boring for her. She just throws them away like ""ah...boring!"". She can interact quickly by different sounds of musical tones, coos with the alphabets and numbers, catching the lights by tapping it with her fingers or her palms.I rate this toy more than 5 stars because my baby is advance as her pediatrician informed me. I also suggest Sesame Elmo cellphone toy, Atom fisherprice. Anything with Alphabets and numbers and different sounds, flashy lights can stimulate our baby's brain development in an excellent growth. Anything that they can hold or grab easily. Like taking it out from its original place. As a good mother, I want whats best for my daughter is for her to learn quickly and efficiently."
3,too fast paced sometimes.....,"We bought this toy for our 8 month old daughter at christmas, we have found that she loses interest in it after a very short period of time. And with the rate of hits and the speed of them that she uses it goes so fast that I'm pretty sure she can't even make out a single letter. It's ok for when i want a few (under 5) extra minutes in the morning. But i wouldn't take this on a trip or anything."
2,Educational Toy,I got this item by returning a duplicate my son got for Christmas. The lights really get him but other than that he shows no interest. There is a volume button to TRY to control how loud or soft the toy plays but my son has figured out how to annoy us by turning it up when we are not expecting it. I am a believer in LeapFrog items. It all really depends on your child.
2,Can't stand this toy!,"My son got this toy when he was 10 months old. He loved it and started playing with it a lot, but at the same time we noticed that all of a sudden he started hitting US all the time!! The songs are absolutely annoying, and I can't imagine that he will learn the alphabet or the numbers from it, since the background noise can be incredibly distracting. This toy would be significantly improved if we could turn off the music to concentrate on the sounds of the letters and numbers. If that happened, I would be able to recommend it for older kids who already know they should not hit their parents."
3,Educational,"This is a very educational toy and I thought it would be lots of fun, especially since he loves to bang/hit thigs. However, he has shown minimal interest in this toy right now - nine months old. However, I have a friend and her daughter played with it alot. I think it depends on the child."
5,The Hit of Christmas,"My son's aunt gave him this for Christmas and he loves it. My son is 8 months old. My niece who is a little younger also loved it. They both figured out very quickly how to make sounds with it. The sounds are not annoying, and it's easy for my son to hold. Plus, he can even hit it on the bottom, and it will still respond."
3,My 1 yr old thinks it's OK,My son got this for his 1st birthday. He plays with it some but isn't overly impressed. Maybe he will be as he gets older?
2,ditto: very annoying. Someone at leapfrog has ADD!,"I bought this based on the positive reviews, thinking it would be great for my daughter to learn the alphabet this way. However, although it does say ""A, B, C..."" as you hit it, the background music, which you cannot shut off, is so loud, you can't focus on the alphabet at all. There is just too much going on with this toy. I should have known; we bought the leapstart learning table at Christmas time and returned it for the same reason: too much going on at once. Give this one a miss. Our daughter has more fun (and more focus) banging on a cookie tin."
3,"Shorted out, has never recovered","We bought this drum two years ago for our daughter. It soon became stuck on certain letters, almost as though there wasn't enough battery power. Even though we replaced the batteries, the drum never really recovered and still behaves erratically.It was cute, has a nicely adjustable volume but basically fell apart. There are better ""banging"" toys than this one.We also paid 1/3 the price listed here. I assume this is some kind of error since the exact same drum in the Spanish version is only $20 on Amazon."
5,Incredible,"I bought this item when my son, who is now 4, was a baby. He got hours of enjoyment just banging on it and listening to the music. It then helped him to count and his ABC's. My one year old son is now loving the drum too. Definitely another wonderful product from LeapFrog!"
1,Save Your money,"This seemed like a good idea, but it is just an annoying toy that does little for our son. The songs are annoying, it continues to play once it is put down and I fail to see this as a good teaching tool. He enjoys banging on pots and pans much more - so we do that and sing the ABC's ourselves."
1,gawd-awful,"This is so bad that I thought it was a joke when I opened it. I love edgy design and mix a lot of stuff, from gypsy to Bauhaus to '50s, in my home. But this book isn't about that at all. It's just a junky mess obviously put together by someone who does not know anything about design. If you want an excuse to create a mess, buy this book. If you're looking for really cool, well-designed eclectic decorating, keep looking for another book. We're talking bad taste here. Tacky, pure and simple."
1,"If you get this, don't call it good design","It's amazing to me personally that someone can put out a book and called it a design book when they have no credentials at all. Reading reviews of this book, I see that we're playing a kind of 'emperor's new clothes game' in which few people are willing to stand up and say, 'Hello, people! This stuff is BAD."" It is bad, not cool and out of the box and chic and trend setting. Just bad."
1,Disappointing,"I love flea markets, foraging for cool stuff, and mixing the unexpected, so I thought I'd love this book. I don't. Mixing is one thing, but being tasteless is another. If you want to simply create a jumble of you-know-what, which is what this book shows, then you don't need this book at all. If want to be inspired to invest more taste and personality than money in your rooms and are a creative spirit, chances are you will prefer Flea Market Decorating, Flea Market Style, or American Junk. Personally, the new book, Flea Market Decorating, is my favorite -- fun, sophisticated, inspiring."
1,Yuk. A mess.,"I agree with the point of the book, which seems to be that decorating should be fun and free and creative. But there are so many magazines and books around that do the job so much better than this one. If you want to end up with a tacky mishmash of a home, then this is the book for you. If you want the same ""be yourself"" message with some great ideas and solid design guidance along the way, you'd better look elsewhere. The rooms in this book look like ticky-tacky crammed stores more than homes. It would drive me crazy to spend much time in such cluttered rooms. Like many today, I am looking for peace and harmony at home versus a mess. I can't even think of anyone to give this book to, so it goes in the trash."
1,A cluttered mess,"Yuk. This book is a cluttered mess. I like edgy design and doing my own thing, but what this book promotes is simply tasteless trash. It is a disservice to those readers who don't know any better. From what I could read about the author, this person operates a store of some sort, which explains the junk-store look of the featured rooms."
1,I found a better book,I wrote a review of this before. What PAD lacks is a grounding in good design. I found a much better book that gives the same freeing message but with more sound and sophisticated results. It's called Flea Market Decorating. The same idea of scrounging for cool stuff and using it in fresh news ways is in Flea Market Decorating. But Flea Market Decorating shows rooms you might actually want to live in.
1,What a hoot,"I admit I did not buy the book after I picked it up and looked through it at the book store, but I did think it was very funny. What a hoot. It's tasteless, tacky, and funny. Kind of like Halloween costumes for rooms. But the author can't be serious."
5,If you don't DIY don't bother,"I'll be the first to say that most of the rooms shown in this book are, for me, un-liveable. Too cluttered, busy and ostentatious for anything except a party. [...]I don't need a style-nazi to tell me how to decorate. But build a coffee table from a surfboard, my own drink coasters or turn my favourite Tiki mug into a lamp? That 's where PAD comes in. If you need a book to tell you what your living space should look like look somewhere else, preferably far, far away. But if you know what you like and a bit of DIY doesn't scare you this book is excellent. And the punch recipes rock!"
4,I can dig it...,"If you look at this book as instructional, you're going to be wildly disappointed. But I don't think that's the point -- in looking at extreme homes, you find many clever ideas that you can pick out, individually, for your own happy medium. The message I got is to look at everyday objects and common household junk with new eyes, be clever, be bold, and be yourself. What's wrong with that? Nothing at all, daddy-o!"
2,"Somewhat Interesting, But Not Very Usefull","This is a fun, but strange book. I ran across it in a shop that sold some retro items, but the price was a bit high. When I found it here, I snagged it quick. If your ""pad"" has a retro motif, this guide may help some. However, it's mostly just on recovery of junk. I found really no use for any of this, whatsoever."
2,Coffee-table Book,"I bought this book to come up with some unique deco ideas but came up flat. The apartments in this book are pretty shabby and freakish looking. If you're going for that starving-artist look for your pad, this is certainaly the book for you. To each his own, I have no problem with starving artist apartments, but it's just not what I had in mind."
3,"Seems Over Priced, 2 per box","2 for $3.50 seems a bit expensive, must be the 24K gold plating.They were easy to use and made a good connection, that part was great.I bet these cost pennies to make.If you need a lot of these it can add up."
2,"not 200, two","dont be fooled by the # 200 thats not the number of ring terminals you get, you only get 2...very disappointed."
4,"Right Part, but did not work correctly therefore Returned.","The part was received on time and properly packaged, but once installed, the unit made the car rev-up to over 4,000 rpm and it would not come down in RPM, which made it unusable.I am hoping the vendor will directly contact me so I can get another one.. I returned the previously ordered unit for a credit.Hank Freemanhfreeman@msn.com"
4,"Remixes, Live and Unreleased Mayhem","If you watched the Heavy Metal 2000 movie and are a Voivod fan you know there is a killer Voivod track in the movie. If you bought the Heavy Metal 2000 soundtrack you also know it isn't there! How annoying.Well, here it is. ION is one of the previously unreleased tracks on this disc, and it alone makes this a worthwhile purchase in my book. DRIFT and EROSION are also new, along with some fairly unremarkable remixes in the Fear Factory Remanufactured vein.The live tracks sound just as good as those from Voivod Lives! and round out another great offering from one of metal's most unique bands."
3,Was this needed?,"I bought this disc mostly because I really enjoy 'Forlorn'. But as with most remix albums, there are about as many disappointments as good points. The sound is a little flat and the mixes either overdone or uninspired. The new tunes are good, as is the live section. In all, adequate but not raising the quality level significantly."
2,True Voivodians should avoid this album,"The remixes on this album are not bad, but still not to my liking. The newly recorded and unrelased tracks has the same poor mix as on 'Negatron' and 'Phobos'. The live recordings on this album are terrible. I did not like the way Eric Forrest sings on the songs that Snake sang on the older Voivod albums. This album is also not a very good effort for Piggy and Away. True Voivodians would be disapointed."
5,An indispensible Fidelio,This is one of the 2 or 3 best Fidelio recordings ever made and belongs in the library of every admirer of this opera and of Beethoven. It was previously issued on CD but without the Leonore overture no. 3. This problem is now remedied because the Leonore overture no. 3 is included as an appendix and can be easily programmed into the main performance if desired.
5,It's all been said below,"I totally concur with what has been written about this recording below. It IS one of the classics of the grammophone and no Beethoven fan or opera lover should be without it. Ludwig et al are wonderful. Listen to her thrillingly beautiful rendition of 'Komm, Hoffnung...' in Act One. Klemperer's conducting is marvellous as is the superb playing of the Philharmonia (and the choral singing too). But make sure you DO NOT MISS the electric performance of the stunning Leonore III overture which comes as an appendix. It's thrilling, dramatic and wonderfully exciting. I LOVE this piece. What a way to end such a great recording as Klemperer's 'Fidelio'!"
2,No two pairs are the same...,"I bought a pair of these jeans and loved them. I bought a second pair and they are nothing like the first. I bought the same style and same size- the second pair I bought is much much bigger. The cut is different, and there is nothing ""short"" about the leg length either. It seems like Levi's are really going downhill... either that, or they only sell their rejects online at amazon."
5,great jeans!,These are exactly what they purport to be--good old-fashioned levis. Just be sure you have the right size before you order online.
1,These fit super weird.,I do not know what I do not understand about buying pants but these fit so weird. they were not too small and not totally too big and did not fit in the leg or anything. baggy all around size 17 at 170lbs 5'4.
2,Saggy - baggy,"The Levi's 524 Too Superlow Boot Cut jeans fit much better. I already sent the 518's back, but from what I recall, they fit just like my title says -- saggy and baggy in the rear. I'm 40 + and pretty much straight up and down -- not much curve, which is why I have to wear jr's jeans. I wear 7L, which only comes in a couple of styles. I really wish the the jean companies would make a few in solid colors instead of everything with the ""worn"" look, or make more in my size.I knew these jeans would be a little higher in the waist than the 524's and that was OK, but I still expected the same fit in the rear... wrong. I don't have a ""granny-butt"" yet, but I don't have the ""boom-boom"" either. If I had a little more filler they probably would have worked, but since I didn't, back they went. Thank you Amazon for making the return so easy!"
2,Run big,These jeans seem to run big and the material was thinner than all my other levi's. would not recommend.
1,Waste of money,"First of all, I must say they are my favorite jeans. Super soft and fit just perfect. Love them.But now, after 4 months, the knee-part ripped and I have a big hole in my jeans now. I did wear them once a week, maybe 2 times and in my opinion they should last a little bit longer than 4 months.Not worth the money."
1,Absolutely not what I ordered.,"I was wearing a pair of Levis 518 Superlow Boot Cut Jeans when I placed the order. I have worn this style for years. I know what size I wear, how they are supposed to fit, and which washes I prefer.What I received was much too small, had an entirely different cut, and was not the wash I chose. The ""boot cut"" was almost a bell bottom, flaring much more than the product pictures indicate. The Blue Rider pictured is an even medium blue. What I received was dark and heavily whiskered from crotch to hip which looks absolutely nothing like the pictures, which I studied before choosing. The pocket detailing and seams appear as a dirty yellow against that rough textured deep blue, which is not attractive at all.I will be returning these and will not buy again. The free return this is eligible for? It has a cost."
2,Whatever happened to good ole dark blue non faded denim?,"Color depicted as Blue Rider as a nice consistent dark blue denim. Recieved a product that looks faded on the legs. If I wanted faded jeans I would stick with the old pairs hanging in my closet or ordered the faded and worn look. I am too old for that high school look and was disappointed in deceptive pictures, Even magnified images were false."
4,Live in these jeans..,Love the fit and the style. Always a great fit.. Only thing is I believe these jeans are getting thinner? The actual material is so thin now.. But I went back and bought 2 more pair.
3,levis 518,Jeans are okay. Don't fit quite as well as the 517. First pair I ordered was a size 7 short and they were really long. Second pair I ordered was a 7 short and they were really short. Couldn't find a happy medium as far as the length goes. This is an Amazon verified purchase. Will stick with the Levis 517.
5,Great Fit Great look!,"These are my favorite jeans. They custom fit every curve, the superlow rise looks awesome."
1,be careful they will send you a skinny jean instead of bootcut.,I ordered the boot cut jean but they sent me the skinny jean. I tried the skinny but it was very uncomfortable.
2,Not what I'd hoped,"These jeans ran large, so I had to order a smaller size. Also, these are made from a very thin material. Not like any denim I've seen before. They felt more like cotton or knit even. Nothing like real jeans should."
2,kept them anyway,"The jeans weren't exactly 518's...but an off brand. Had a few sewn patches that weren't mentioned before I ordered them. I'll keep them anyway, but probably not buy from this person again."
4,Comfortable jeans,"These jeans are very comfortable and attractive. They can run a little small, so I order one size up. I love that they offer long sizes, as I am 5'11"" and need lengthy jeans. These longs work well for me. I will say this is the second pair I bought within the past several years, as the first one wore out and faded too much. However the price is reasonable and I enjoy them while they last."
2,Pictures Are A Bit Misleading,"I have a pair of older Juniors Levis 518 Bootcut that I love but can't find anymore cause they've started making everything in stretch denim. So when I saw these on Amazon, I thought I'd order a pair. The new ones look different and the pictures featured are of the older pairs. Needless to say that when I recieved a stretch pair, I was disappointed. However the service itself was OK and shipping made it on time so you still get 2 stars from me for trying."
5,Levis 518 - finally Jeans for flat butts everywhere!,"I have no bottom and all my other jeans get increasingly saggy throughout the day and with each wear. Levis 518 hold in my tummy (they're really not super-low compared to other makes), and they accent my rear-end rather than hide it with loose and progressively baggy material. I discovered these jeans by chance at Costco for $15. I took them home, tried them on, wore them for 2 days, went online to Amazon and bought another pair in an alternate colour for $35 (Costco didn't offer any other colours and worth paying double). I love these jeans and have zero complaints. Colour is even, material is medium thickness, the short length fits my 5'3"" frame with flats/running shoes very well. If I want to wear heals or boots, I will purchase in average length."
5,The best jeans,"I bought a pair of these jeans at my local Macy's and was disappointed when I saw they only had one wash available, the Blue Rider. I already knew the fit worked great for me (I would definitely not describe them as ""super low"") so I hopped on Amazon and ordered 4 more pairs in Black, Closet Swap, Iced Indigo, and Railer. They all fit perfectly, I couldn't be happier.A side note, they do stretch out a bit but I didn't have a problem with them becoming too baggy on me as some reviewers have complained. They are also zip fly, not button fly as mentioned in the product description. They do have a pretty wide boot cut to them and are relatively long, but those are things I prefer in my denim anyway."
4,"Nice jeans, very good fit","These jeans are great, they are low rise without being uncomfortable, my only problem with them is that they are bigger than the same size, same length I bought previously at the store"
5,Fit is everything in jeans !,I love my new 518 Levi's Superlow boot cut jeans with a low rise.The fit is fantastic.I find it difficult to get jeans that fit and having found these I don't need to look anywhere else.I now have 4 pairs of these jeans and don't wear anything other jeans .The searching for a decent pair of jeans is finally over !!!Thoroughly recommended and very quick delivery also.
4,Not just for Juniors,These are just what I was looking for. The waist height is much better than the Too Super Low. The waist falls just beneath the belly button. They do get loose after wearing which is why I'm only giving 4 stars. I wish we could go back to jeans without lycra or spandex in the denim.
3,I only buy Levis,"These Levis are nice, and have the regular Levi fit, which is what I was hoping for when I bought them. My only complaints are: the front pockets are ""fake"" pockets - they are only about an inch and a half or two inches deep. I didn't expect this from Levis, as I have never purchased a pair of Levis with fake front pockets. The only other complaint I have about them is that the ""Levis"" tag on the back is white with a silver stitch, and I prefer the standard Levis red tag."
1,NOT BARBARA!!,"I bought this album, just under a different title and different picture on the front. It had all the same songs on it though. At the time I was in Barbara's fan club, and wrote in about it after I bought it and questioned whether it was really Barbara or not. I got my response directly from the president of the fan club, which was definitely NOT! This is definitely not the Barbara Mandrell we all know and love."
1,Avoid this,"To describe this as a Barbara Mandrell album is a distortion of the truth. Note the small lettering - and friends. What this means is that most of these songs were not recorded by Barbara. Even if one or two did feature her voice, they were very early recordings and do not even sound like her earliest recognized recordings - those she did for Columbia.I love Barbara's music - she is one of my all-time favorites - but you won't find any of Barbara's music here."
4,"Stunning, but not his best","In general this album is similar to Tyrannosaurus's debut (my people were fair...) but in my opinion it lacks the freshness of the former. ""Deboraarobed"" is simply their debora plays backward, and some fillers (e.g. friends)make this record a sub to its debut. Anyway, it's still full with mystic(if meaningless) lyrics, catchy melodies, brillant drumming, etc. Good track like ""stacey grove"" also save it from a forgettable work. Enjoy it if you like 60's psychedelic folk. Not bad, but comparatively weak among Tyrannosaurus Rex's albums."
1,Doesn't work for dandruff!,My boyfriend has dandruff and has been using head & shoulders for years. We're trying to find natural shampoos but have had no luck so far. This shampoo did nothing for his dandruff. If you need something for dandruff look somewhere else.
1,Gave me dandruff...,"I was previously using Nature's Gate Shampoo ([...]) and it worked GREAT! Took a bit to get use to the smell, but now I love how it smells. I'm going into the health field so I've been trying to experiment with natural products so instead of going with Nature's Gate again, I decided to try this shampoo. Nature's Gate has kept me dandruff free for 4 months now and after the first use of this shampoo, my scalp started itching...when I scratched, I noticed I was SNOWING! So everything it said it helps with...it did totally opposite.I bought this and the conditioner...so far I like the conditioner. I've been using that with what I have left of nature's gate shampoo and I'm pretty happy with it. I still like the smell of my other conditioner better though ([...]) and it seemed to work just as well. Both my older shampoo and conditioner are also considerably cheaper! I'd recommend those of this product."
4,pretty effective,"I have been looking for years for an effective natural and organic shampoo, and I think with this product I have found a keeper. I have a chronic dry and flaky scalp and most shampoos I've tried didn't do much if anything to alleviate the problem. This product however has helped and I would recommend it to anyone with a similar condition."
2,broke too soon,"It broke in a matter of months, I guess the price was too good to be true. The silver is pure though, I didn't get any irritation from the metal, even when not taking it off for weeks at a time."
1,Bracelet,The bracelet broke multiple times. Guess u get what u pay for. It didn't cost very much money. Have a merry Christmas.
3,"Very pretty, broke quickly","Purchased two for my daughters. First necklace broke after fwo weeks when my daughter put it between her teeth and bit ( of course that makes sense I thought) but the second one broke only days later when I was pulling my smaller daughters shirt of her head, and I was only gently tugging. Very sweet look, but too fragile, especially for kids. However, it is nearly impossible to find a more secure type beaded neck.ace in a 14"" length."
5,Better than expected,"I have another sterling ball chain of slightly larger MM, and it tarnished within a month. I bought this one based on another review that said her products don't tarnish, and after 2 months of constant wear, I agree. It is also strong - I pull on it occasionally, and it hasn't broken. I will certainly look here first for my next sterling purchase."
2,THE MOODY BLAHS!!!,"Listening to this is painful!!! Has Justin Hayward ever sung a note that is not off-key?? And his voice is so loud in the mix you can't ignore it-- no matter how hard you try!! When they remastered this they should have processed his voice with digital pitch correction to at least make it somewhat listenable--although it couldn't help the lifelessness of his singing(?) style. I've always considered the Moody Blues to be a band in desperate need of a singer, and listening to this all the way through for the first time confirms this, though Mr. Hayward does manage to rally somewhat for 'Knights In White Satin.' The extra star is solely for The London Symphony and the album concept."
2,Too pretentious for me...,"With the exception of Yes, Steely Dan is generally the closest I come to prog-rock. So if you think I don't really know the genre, you're right. However, I feel this is overblown and pretentious. Granted, all that can't stop Nights In White Satin from being an incredibly powerful, lovely piece (other than the crappy stoner poem at the end). But even then, it doesn't strike me like the work of Yes (specifically Close to the Edge and Starship Trooper). The rest is overblown and endless, especially all eight-and-a-half minutes of the aptly-titled Forever Afternoon. If you're looking for grade ""A"" prog-rock, go with Yes."
5,Days of Future Passed,"I hadn't listened to this album in 30+ years, now I remember why I loved it! I could still recite every word to every selection.. It's a keeper."
5,Oustanding,I bought this album solely for Nights in White Satin. Love the entire thing. Planning to buy it on vinyl soon.
5,Ratsnake,"What can you say about this Classic CD(LP) that started it all for theMoody Blues.? At the time the concept of a full orchestra was somthing strange & new, never done before by a rock band.Turns out the result is a CD that has gone down in history as one of the best ever.If you are a Moodys fan & remember this one or you are a fan & don't,eather way this is one you must hear & must have. AAAA!!"
4,The Moody Blues' best album,"The Moody Blues' first ""psychedelic"" album--their first album after they lost Denny Laine and gained Ray Thomas and Justin Hayward--succeeds far better than most albums of the period that combine classical and pop elements. First of all, they employ the London Symphony Orchestra to accompany them. Then, Justin Hayward provides a couple ready-made classics (""Tuesday Afternoon"", ""Nights in White Satin""). Add a day-into-night theme and a psychedelic cover, and it instantly appeals to hippies and artsy people. Of course, who could reject the emotion in ""Nights in White Satin"" and ""Dawn is a feeling""? You'd have to be a robot."
5,moody blues,"Excellent songs! Tuesday Afternoon and Nights in White Satin are popular ones, but I really like the progression of an entire day in this CD."
4,A Classic from the 60s,"I usually listen to Mediaeval or ""Classical"" music, but I bought this one because a friend reminded me of it.I can't believe that after about forty years since I first heard it, I still think of it as one of the great concept albums ever produced.If you loved the 60s, then this is the album for you!"
5,An outstanding album,"'Days of Future Passed', a 1967 release, is an all time great album. It ranks with 'Sgt.Pepper's'. The entire album is divided into the times of day. It starts with the beautiful'Dawn is a Feeling' & ends with the immortal'Nights in White Satin'.Throughout, the Moody Blues have not deviated from the concept. Their songs are interspersed with flourishes from the London Festival Orchestra. Don't miss this one. It was an album way ahead of its time then. And now."
5,Moody Blues,I was trying to copy my lp and I was not happy with the results and I was so pleased you carried the CD. Thanks for the memories!!!
1,Tracks from Master are Missing!,"I couldn't believe my ears. The harmony on the last part of ""Tuesday Afternoon"" is missing! Whoever remastered this from the original tapes FORGOT to mix in all the tracks and it sounds hollow. How incredibly annoying. The only way you're going to hear the real music is to turn on your record player and play the old vinyl. Maybe the SACD CD was remastered correctly, but the AAD CD was NOT."
4,4.5 stars if rating system allowed,"This is the 1st MB release with Justin and John as members of the band. I think it's safe to say that without J & J, we would be saying stuff like...""the Moody who's?"" This one album guaranteed that we would remember. Every once in a while an artist makes art that is timeless. The Moodies did just that in 1967 with the release of their critically acclaimed 'Days of Future Passed'. There is something for everyone here. The songwriting and storytelling aspect is unique and believable. The music segues from theme to theme seamlessly. Sometimes soaring, sometimes rocking, always appealing to our sense of the truth. Days is the defining Moodies release - if you like it you'll probably like most of their stuff. A day in the life of 'everyman' put to music, prose and song. The cross-fades and segues weave a tale worth hearing, a tale that is still applicable today - nearly 40 years later."
4,Maiden voyage,"An album of pop songs interspersed with orchestral segues is a dangerous idea that probably shouldn't be tried again, but the Moody Blues pulled it off fairly well. The first third of the album, where the orchestra is prominent, is tiresome, but once the suite of songs kicks into high gear with ""Peak Hour"" and `Tuesday Afternoon"", you are in the spell of one of the great and most unique bands of all time in a maiden voyage of uncommon beauty. An overlooked gem is ""Twilight Time"", one of Ray Thomas' best songs ever, a rocker pulsed by a hammering piano bass line, Justin Hayward's evocative backing vocal, and colorful imagery that really works. Unfortunately you can't sample this song here since it is coupled on the same track as the much less interesting ""Sunset"". ""Nights in White Satin"" is overplayed, and the Moodies' reputation is excessively connected to this song, so it is easy to forget that it once sounded fresh."
5,As Good As I Remembered,"I've had the LP for years, but I seldom get around to playing my old favorites on my turntable. I saw this on sale, and I knew I had to have it on my iPod. This way I'll play it more often, and enjoy what I think is their best album."
4,Memories,"I first purchased this album in 1969 on 8 track tape. Yup, dinosaurs had 8 tracks. Anyway, I used to sit in my car and listen to this for hours. As I remember, Moody Blues was the first POP band to include a full orchestra while recording. After so many years of the Beatles et al, and 4 piece bands (drums, guitars and keyboard), it was great to listen to the Moody Blues."
5,Classic 60's Album,Classic album that has to be listened to in its entirety. Additional tracks don't really add anything as they are demos or cover songs.
1,Where is the Original Album,This is the first album that I have bought from Amazon andit will probably be the last.A long playing LP or a cd did not require me clicking on each songin order for it to play.
3,Not so Poetic,"""Days of Future Passed,"" is an overrated classic that does contain some great moments. The best somgs, ""Tuesday Afternoon,"" and ""Nights in White Satin"" are perfect late 60s period pieces. Some of the other songs, however, have not aged nearly as well. What really mars the album are the unbelievably pretentious ""poetry"" that opens and closes the album. They might have been prophetic during a spaced out Summer of Love acid trip, but they are perfectly ridiculous today. Overall, you're better off with a Moody Blues anthology album."
1,Warning - two different versions of this album on Amazon!,"This album is one of the Moody Blue's milestones, a symphonic progressive rock album.But BEWARE - Amazon sells two different MP3 versions of this particular DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED album. A cheaper $5 version, and a more expensive $9.49 album.The cheaper version only contains the first seven tracks of the original album; it does not have the remaining tracks, numbered 8 through 7. And missing is their classic TUESDAY AFTERNOON.So beware - if you're looking for the complete album, do not buy the cheaper version!NOTE: I gave this one star so people would know that they could be shortchanged if they buy the cheaper version."
5,PURO ROCK SINFONICO !,"UN DISCO QUE FUE EL DETONADOR DE LOS MOODY BLUES A NIVEL MUNDIAL CON LOS CLASICOS NIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN Y TUESDAY AFTERNOON, UN ALBUM CONCEPTUAL CON LA MEZCLA DE ROCK Y ORQUESTA SINFONICA, DONDE LOS 5 INTEGRANTES DE LA BANDA COLABORAN CON SUS ELABORADAS COMPOSICIONES Y TAMBIEN DEFINIO EL RUMBO QUE IBA A TOMAR LA BANDA CON SU SONIDO INCONFUNDIBLE, HACIENDO USO DEL MELOTRON, ES UN ALBUM QUE NO PUEDE FALTAR EN TODO COLECCIONISTA DE MUSICA ROCK."
3,Can't believe how muted the sound is!,"Maybe my memory is faulty. I had and enjoyed the LP when first released and enjoyed so much! But, buying this remastered version is such a disappointment. The sound seems so muted. Maybe my hearing is not what it once was. I purchased In Search of the Lost Chord at the same time and the latter has better sound, although not as good as I would have liked. Wish I'd hung onto my vinyl!"
5,Days of Future Passed,"I had forgotten just how good this album is. I bought it when it was first released in 1967-what an incredible experience that first listen was! There have been some negative comments about this remaster-but having not heard the album in many years, I really can't notice any major differences. It is a fantastic blend of poetry, rock and symphony. The added tracks are interesting, but will take several listenings to grow on me."
2,Days of Future Passed,"I have and love this on vinyl, and I have bought it twice on CD for the sake of convenience. Both sound like they were recorded off the vinyl, through the speakers! The fidelity is just not there; on some of the cuts, namely (Evening) Time To Get Away, one track is missing entirely -- half of two-part harmony. Guess you don't notice it unless you had the original album, but I can't listen to 'em."
5,loved it,"I read this book and quickly read every book out by Ken Gire. I love his writing style, his honesty, and his down to earth encouragement. When I was going through a very difficult time in my life I felt like someone understood...Ken Gire. They were very helpful to me. He always points to God, but in a very real way. Can't say enough about this book."
1,would be really cool,"If I ever receive them almost a week past due date this is pitiful I just want them to ship already the estimated due date wasn't even close I mean seriously! Why haven't I got my floormats this is ridiculous- sincerely, a really really irritated custom"
2,Boomers beware ! Re-recorded audio track !,"These are the first Gumby shorts from about 1956/57, with all their weird surrealism and goofiness. Unfortunately (and it's a BIG unfortune), the collection here has the awful re-recorded soundtracks from the early 1990s TV reissue, with uniform voice ""talent"", brand new intros (no classic theme), and new, more ""modern"" music score.This is a fine introduction for the littlest kids, but grown up fans with grind their teeth to powder! Here's hoping Rhino re-issues this with corrections: WE WANT THE ORIGINAL 1950s SOUNDTRACKS (at least on a 2nd audio track)"
1,Horrible soundtrack remake,It's ok... but the synthesizer track is a disgrace to Gumby fans. I don't understand why Rhino couldn't have used the original. It's very disappointing. THE ORIGINAL IS ALWAYS THE BEST. I would discourage Gumby fans from buying this release and to hunt down the older copies from Family Home Entertainment.
3,CHARM LOST!,"I completely agree with the previous reviewer. I just got this Gumby DVD and was expecting to be thrown back into a nostalgic past but this new soundtrack completely ruins the experience. I wasnt aware this new soundtrack was made in 80's. I used to watch Gumby on television during the late 80's after school and I dont recall hearing this synthesized soundtrack. I think the picture quality is okay but I cant understand why they had to use this new music. I would suggest that if you must have a Gumby DVD just buy this Volume 1, do not get the whole box set, you'll only be dissapointed 10 times over. I hope someone re-considers and re-releases this set with its original soundtrack restored. It's a sad day in Gumby ville until then ;("
4,A Magically-Sung MAGIC FLUTE,"Certainly the best SUNG version around, if not the best CONDUCTED version - Klemperer has his moments of brillance, but some of the music drags when it should dance (parts of the overture, Papageno & Papagena's duet), and is manic when it should be lyrical or slow. Still, there are truly lovely magical muscial moments to be found, despite this. Janowitz's Pamina is a delight, as is Berry's Papageno, and Popp is probably the best Queen of the Night on CD out there, with an almost unearthly pure voice befitting the character - so if you love her two highlight arias then this is a definite for your collection."
4,"Impressive cast, but...","This recording has one of the best cast assembled for an Opera Recording, Janowitz, Berry, Popp, etc. However although their voices are amazing you can feel that there was no chemistry and there is a lack of feeling in their performances, specially the male parts. I also dislike the tempo of the recording, sometimes it gets too slow and personally I feel that you loose the rhythm of the story.This is my second recording for this Opera, my first one is the version directed by Karl Böhm and I have to say I prefer that one, although the female voices are inferior to the ones of this recording you feel more in them.In the end is up to you I would say that this is a great recording but one that prefers technique over drama. It has great female performances but a very slow tempo."
3,"Quality control, Breyer...","I was excited to recieve my Dressage Megan doll, she looked so amazing in the box, and I should have left her there. As soon as I took her out, both of her legs fell off. The rubber that held them onto her body had snapped while she was IN the box. I managed to repair her with a twist tie from the box, but it took several hours to arrive at that solution and it is by no means a permanent one. I'll have to repair her again once the twist tie wears out. However, the dressage outfit that she comes with is pretty nice. And as my other Breyer dolls have yet to fall apart, I suspect that I just got a bad one. That, or they're all time bombs."
2,Too big! Couldn't fit any of my breyer horses!,"When I got the Breyer doll in the mail about the first thing I did was see if she could ""ride"" on my Breyer horses. And guess what? Her legs were almost touching the floor (this was on the horse). It has really nice outfit. It is very realistic.If you were to buy this doll to ride your Breyer horses then you may not want it. If you want a doll rider to fit the Breyer horses then the 6' Ashley doll rider would be good. If you are just collecting the Breyer riders and not the horses then it would be okay."
3,Good Collection,"Unless you're a research scientist or have found yourself wrapped up in the miniscule debates over Kuhn's writings ( eg. ""What exactly IS a paradigm, perfesser?""), this book is delightful! Of particular interest are the two essays ""What Are Scientific Revolutions?"" and ""The Trouble With The Historical Philosophy of Science."" Some of this can be found in ""The Essential Tension"" as he was always repeating himself to different audiences."
2,Believe what you read!,"Well, I didn't believe the folks that reviewed this EV-4500 Casio 4"" tv so I bought one.. Big mistake!! You get a little over one hour of battery life,you don't get an A/c adapter.That's and extra $25.A car adapter is $30 and you have to order both from Casio and yes, IT'S the only one that fits. The stand is just that.. a stand.the tv just sits on it and can fall off with the slightest touch. Reception is ok at best and if you use a headset you only get mono. (That's only sound out of one side) And for the $$$ you should get all the accessories included with the TV. No carrying case either..I used my Circuit City bag...and took the %@#* thing back!! live and learn.."
1,Service repair unsatisfactory,"I purchased this portable tv for a christmas present, after several attempts at different locations the reception is terrible. I sent it to casio for repair, they have had tv for over 4 weeks,and they are still waiting for repair parts.I have contacted them and they promice to update me with the progress but they do not. I have requested a new portable tv and they said they will repair this one. I should not have this tv in for repairs it is new."
1,"5"" LCD COLOR TV","No matter where I placed the unit, I could not get good reception unless I had it outside of a building. I placed it near the window but it only worked for a little bit."
1,Quits Working Do Not Buy,"I bought this and the picture quit working after a few uses.I returned it thinking it was a random problem, Amazon promptly shipped me a new one and guess what 2 months later same damn problem and this time I do not thin Amazon (more than 30 days)will stand behind it and i will have to deal with Casio for this made in China peice of junk."
4,myreview,"I was quite pleased with the TV. I has been many years since I had my last portable TV which was black and white and had a 2"" screen. The technology is much improved. Cascio is a leader in portable TV technology and I can see why. The only downfall is the need to buy an AC adaptor."
5,Still Think of this Book Years Later,"I read this book quite some time ago, yet I still think of it or reference it when speaking to others when I want to make a particular point. I found it to be a great read with information that is very relevant to today regarding the the current state of international relations. Use of the Michael system in thinking about other countries and cultures gives one a way to understand why another nation may behave in ways one might find very troublesome - and provide a way to understand why one can't just provide democracy or other cultural ways on another group of people. I loved the book. I've given away multiple copies. Buy it! Read it! Think about it!"
4,A Wonderful Guide to Life,"An Excellent book for the souls asking where am I going, and where have I been! Is there a new edition called The World According to Michael - New Adventures?"
5,"More Michael, More Understanding","This Michael Book is channeled by a different medium than the first several Michael books I have read. While the style is lighter and breezier, it does impart an in-depth understanding as to how our souls develop and function during each level, and how this affects our interaction(s) in different areas of our world. A study of the Michael books gives outstanding info to understanding others in our families and work habitats. A ""must"" for those who truly wish to understand how our plane works and our souls develop."
2,durability an issue on this one,"Even though I bought this toy ~ 2 yrs back, it was barely used until about 6 months ago, when my younger child discovered it. It's been treated really gently-- he's not a ""chuck it"" type-- but all of a sudden the 2nd row buttons began to call out the 3rd row numbers. It's not a battery issue. SO I contacted Leap Frog, because these things aren't exactly cheap, and asked if it was fixable. That was 3 weeks ago, so I can safely say their 48 hr turnaround time is a bunch of bull. I also had one of the First leap Pad units for my first child, and I was never impressed with the performance of that, either. So it might be just mediocre engineering in general with them, which is just unacceptable given the prices they charge. SO I guess unless I want my son to believe that 9 and 14 are the same number, I gotta chuck the math desk and go buy some flash cards! :)"
4,If you're gonna buy ONE of their live CDs...,"This disc is more rich and varied than BIG HEART and has no weak cuts on it, unlike the OTHER Berlin live disc, which wastes a ton of time on a total throwaway, ""Mr. Stinky's Blues."" But be warned -- as I say in my review of the other Berlin disc -- the colors and numbers of these discs change occasionally. Sometimes 2 is 1, 1 is 2, and either can appear in red or black. I dunno why. Anyhow, this is live stuff from the period between VOICE OF CHUNK and QUEEN OF ALL EARS. ""Tibet"" is actually a VOICE OF CHUNK number under a different name, but I forget which. ""A Paper Bag and the Sun,"" maybe."
1,the title is apt,"this book was boring. it read like a reality show, lots of irrelavant detail instead of meaningful development. characters were not engaging and their motivations unrealistic."
1,inferior yet opulent,"Opulence is a key word here. It is tasteless, with no talent, dancing is inferior. It looks amateurish if compared to Bolshoi's Nutcracker."
2,"A fine performance, but not inspiring.","It's a fine performance, while I enjoyed some of the scenes, the Christmas tree is in good size and nicely decorated, and the changing of the size of toys & boxes to make Clara appear smaller is quite dramatic, the Arabian dancer is pretty good, and the Russians way of popping out of the Easter eggs is fun to watch.However I felt a let down in some area:There is no chorus in waltz of the flowers, too sad. The beautiful chorus is one of my favorite in that scene.The main characters seem to more focus on technical excellence, while less on emotion.The final Pas de deux isn't that exciting, Elizabeth Powell's dance is fine but not exceptional.Overall it's not as good as the Bolshoi version (danced by amazing Nina Kaptsova and Artem Ovcharenko), the set, dance and orchestra are close to perfection."
5,Fine Performance of Nutcracker,"I grew up with Nutcracker music on vinyl and saw a live performance in college. Nutcracker is a favorite of mine and I listen often during the year. I wanted grandchildren to see rather than hear a performance, and this one satistifes at every leve. The staging is wonderful, the dancing is strong, the music is well played. Everyone will enjoy this performance. Don't hesitate."
1,Wasn't what I expected,"This book I can't fully recommend primarily because it was forced study and not lead study. It's more of: here is what I say this means and then a list of scriptures that follow that particular topic. I'm an attorney who has studied the Bible for years, I can (of course with the leading of the Holy Spirit) analyze on my own the author's group of scriptures laid out for me. If you want to research or rather verify just what the author has already proscribed, then this might just be the book for you.It's only that I prefer to pick my own topics."
1,Misleading Title,I thought this workbook would include the entire bible because it says Teaching the Bible not Teaching some of the Bible. It is not something I can use. Maybe you can.
2,Not a bible study workbook.,"I was thinking that this book would help me study the Bible... It does help you study topics deamed worthy by the author... but as far as helping you develop a more thorough understanding of the scriptures... eh,not so much."
5,i'm in the movie,i was an extra in this film standing behind the main characters in the first airport scene....of COURSE i love it......the rest of the movie was mediocre at best though..
2,what rubbish,"want to watch a sexy comedy about young teenage boys fantasising over their older female housekeeper? then don't bother watching this, it's cute and stuff, with a few shots of breasts, but really, any movie with Jason Biggs is far better, i mean this isn't even sexy or funny"
2,Watch it! That's statutory rape.,"Interesting yet very shocking to even imagine. Even for a child to watch such a film. Where have all the innocence of our beloved children gone? I don't even think, this film should've never even been created to begin with."
5,private lessons,i grow up with the idea of having a older woman to teach me. all because of this movie. i like it.
1,Don't Buy the green Korean pirate copy of this DVD,"When you search this title on Amazon, it comes up with several DVD listings. I can't attest to the quality and content of all of them, but DON'T buy the green labeled, Asian, (pirated) remaster. It is clearly marked with Korean hieroglyphics on the front cover and the phrase ""NO CUT"" on the back cover. Whoever remastered this obviously comes from a country that has a phobia of full frontal nudity. In my opinion, their disclaimer phrase on the back was mispelled. They should have included an ""N"" as the second-to-last character. Some portions of Sylvia's original performance have been digitally CU_T from the film with a blurring effect. It also lacks the Widescreen feature if that really matters."
3,Not Widescreen,"I was looking forward to this, but when I got the DVD the first thing I noticed on the special features was that this was a full screen presentation. Being a film purist, I don't tend to watch altered versions of any film. Full screen is not a special feature if that is the only format you have to choose from! Going back to the amazon site to see if I had missed something, no where did it say that this was a fullscreen version. Very easy to overlook when you have 25th anniversary edition emblazoned across the top of the box. A special anniversary edition usually denotes a film released in its most complete state, not modified to fit a television screen. Even moreso now since most televisions are widescreen. C'mon guys give us a decent version of this pic, or at least tell us specifically what we are buying."
1,What a rip-off,This movie may be uncut but it is definately not uncensored. In the shots of Sylvia's nether regions the images are intentionally distorted. In the final love making scene the screen has been darkened to the point it's practically blacked out and you can't see anything. What a rip-off. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage.
3,Private Lessons(Thanks to Netflix Instant),"A somewhat okay movie considering some of us as Guys growing up had it in for the older ladies and still do, I don't condone it,It is one of those 80s Nudey movies that might appeal to some and might not to others."
5,Moodies TOCCC,"They took one of the Moody Blues best albums and made it even better. I can't speak about the technical aspects of remastering, but my ears know that this was well worth the $."
5,Thinking is the best way to travel...,"Oddly enough a lyric from another Moody Blues album. It is somehow more appropo for this album. Anyone who has given this album high marks mostly speaks for my comments as well in one way or another, so no need to wax redundant. While I have a long list of music favorities, this was, for over 30 years, and still is my overall favorite album for a host of reasons. The ""in perfect condition"" album cover holds a place of framed prominence in my home theatre while I listen to the CD version (the LP version having long ago been stripped out by too many excursions of the needle)."
3,Not My Cup Of Tea,"Lots of people love this album, but, for me, it's a long way down from Days, Chord, and Threshold. Certainly, if you're expecting a ""Nights In White Satin"" or even a ""Ride My See Saw,"" this isn't the album for you. Recommended only to complete a collection of the first seven albums, which, taken together, continue to represent an amazing body of work."
3,Weakest of the super seven,"This album is the least musical and most dreariest, lacking the great melodies of top Moody stuff... definately not their best. I love the Moody Blues, and in any other context would give it 5 stars, but I feel the Moody's lost in on this one."
5,A Wonderful Musical Treatise On The Passage Of Time Made Even Better With Wonderful Remastering And Bonus Cuts,"TO OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN'S CHILDREN, which is yet another magnificent Moody Blues CD, is now even better, with warm, thick remastering and numerous bonus cuts. The albums lyrics about time, what its passage means, and how we all must move on from our past, now inspire me even more to put looking good for my favorite actresses as a higher priority than attending Thanksgiving Dinner at my old school for my 15th graduation anniversary, thanks to increased warmth and clarity in the sound of the singing and how the instruments carry the vocals even better now. This is a reissue you definitely should NOT pass up."
5,moody blues,"Moody Blues is one of my favorite bands, this CD has great songs, including Gypsy. Great to add to a classic rock lovers collection."
4,The Moody Blues Turn Out Another Classic!!!,"Of all the Moody Blues Cds this is the one that took me a long time to finally get into and I'm glad I did !!! Its also interesting the story behind this Cd in the Linear Notes !!!Justin churns out some more great songs Gypsy and Watching & Waiting , John's Beautiful Ballad Eyes Of A Child and his collabration with Mike Pinder Out and In , Graeme pulls it off again with Higher & Higher and the Rockin' Instrumental Beyond and we can't forget Ray Thomas Eternity Road !!! A Must Have Album in your collection they don't make albums like this anymore !!! This well be around for a long time and must be played To Our Children's Children's Children"
5,A Must For Any True Music Fan!,"What can I say,over the past 25 years I've worn out 10 vinyl albums,3 cassette tapes,I bought the CD before i even owned a CD player of which i had to buy the very next week just to listen to it and in 1998 I bought the gold disc! If it ever comes put in a better sounding format I'll buy that too! This is in my opinion one of the best pieces of music in this century and is every bit as timeless as the music of Mozart or Beetoven!"
5,Mind Expanding!,"It's amazing how many life lessons the Moodies sing about. The music is so appealing to my ears and soothing. You can relate and interpert every thing they sing about into your own life. This album is the best example of what they are all about. They are untouchable and unable to be dupicated. Their words will make you reflect. Ever since I heard my father listen to them on vinyl, I have been unable to stop loving them."
2,rip off,"Last two cuts are live and not from the original album, this is a real let down as I am replacing at great cost my old record collection with mp3. real disappointment, any deviation from original album should be revealed prior to purchase."
3,"Fun, balls shoot everywhere- but then get lost!","Fun for 5-10 year olds (maybe older), but the balls get lost and then the search is on. A fine toy but not much to do after about 20 minutes of shooting the balls off and surprising people."
2,wild planet toys,"This toy was advertised as having foam/or soft balls. Not so, they are hard plastic balls covered in black something. They hurt when are activated. Worse yet, they fly in every direction and are immediately lost. I have no Idea where to buy replacement balls. I am not impressed."
5,great holiday gift,"Like many of the women inside it, this compact book is beautiful - cloth cover, classy presentation, vivid images. While there are a few celebs (Hepburn, Mother Teresa, Billie Holiday), many of these pictures are of unknowns - rich and poor, black and white, young and old, happy and sad. This diversity is the book's secret joy. Romantic and heartfelt (not cheesy), it would be a safe and thoughtful gift for almost anyone, a provocative addition to coffee-tables everywhere."
1,liked style but poor quality,love the looks of this watch but the band fell apart less than a year after i bought it. i will try to have it fixed but fear it will just happen again due to the poor design.
1,it's so bad,"This CD is very deceptive. One has to look at the small print to see that the recordings are not the originals. However, these re-recordings aren't even worthy of a listen because of the God awful production value. The recording of HELLO WALLS is live, recorded it appears at one of those supper clubs or maybe in a studio with a hand full of people. Upon first hearing, i thought it was recorded off AM radio, since there is static over the recording!! The sound is muddy, amateurish, and the reason i'm so upset is because the company that put this CD out took advantage of the lack of Faron Young music on the market and released this...you are better off to buy his box set that's sold here on Amazon that chronicles his Capitol years. Also, the Millennium Collection series is another CD to grab. This CD, plus THE ESSENTIAL FARON YOUNG 2-CD set which sports a younger picture of Faron but contains nearly the same bad produced re-recordings, are a disgrace."
5,Interpretation that may never return,"""Interpretation that may never return"". That's how gramophone magazine has closed it's review for Bohm's Cosi, and how can we disagree with this? A magnificent recording with Walter Legge at the head of the production, 9 years after his first Cosi made with Karajan in 1954, (perhaps the best Cosi in gramophone) he returned with this 1963 stereo remake of mozart's masterpiece with impressive results. The only thing that may someone say is that maybe Bohm is not as ""happy"" as he should be for this comic opera but as we know he never faced mozart music as a laughing matter, anyway the result Justifies him in every prospective."
4,there are alternatives,"Bought it because of the rave reviews I saw here. It is good but i am not sure it is so good. Jacobs on Harmonia sounds more dramatic, more natural and with a cast (overall) at least as good as this one. Not to mention better sound and a great orchestra. So before you buy this one check out reviews for Jacbos version."
4,great quality and price.,Even my flat feet feel great in these hiking shoes. The price was very reasonable and they arrived promptly. These are comfortable and sturdy shoes that i recommend to everyone.
5,An Invaluable Guide to Glass Collectors,"This slim volume is a storehouse of invaluable information. With over 6,000 entries, GLASS FACT FILE provides the collector with a resource which will be referred to again and again. Besides the entries, there are sections on bottle marks, museums with glass collections, glass collectors' clubs and associations, and Internet resources. The attention to detail in this volume is simply amazing!"
5,another exceptional effort,"This is a child-sized, board book of the Opie/Wells collaboration, My First Mother Goose. It is a perfect selection of well-known and lesser used nursery rhymes and the incomperable illustrations of the larger volume. Toddlers will enjoy being ""on their own"" and enjoying the pictures or sharing it with their favorite adult and learning their first lessons in rhyme."
4,Human Instinct,"This is another clear and entertaining book from Robert Winston. Sadly it has many anecdotes and information from his other book 'The Human Mind' in addition to much information from Dawkins 'The Selfish Gene' (which I have to say is a better starting point if this kind of thing interests you). Saying that, if you haven't read either of those books, this will both inform and entertain you. It has Winstons usual conversational style of writing and many insightful moments as you progress through the book. Overall not a bad introduction to popular science or human instinct, but nothing original for those who've read more on this topic.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,"Sensible, natural comfort and advice","Finally, some comfot and joy for men and women who have lost the ability to eat naturally and ""soulfully."" A disgruntled reader above lamented the lack of feminist discussion in the book. As a feminist, I agree that many of women's problems with food are based on the exploitive culture we live in, but I also know quite a few men who struggle with weight and with food, if not so much about body image as about health and aging. This book isn't trying to analyze the many historical and societal reasons why people have lost the ability to eat peacefully and naturally, it's trying to provide a very real, day-to-day, method for restoring soulful eating for most people. Obviously, it's not a textbook for serious eating disorders or any other kind of disorder. But it's a great source of wisdom for the average eater who needs to restore insight, instinct and reason to their daily meals. This book needed to be written--thanks for writing it, Dr. Harper!"
1,Sorry folks - this ain't the Holy Grail!,"After reading and dismissing this book a year ago, I read all the reviews and testimonials posted here and decided to give it another look. But no matter HOW many friends and relatives write to laud this book, the truth is that it offers no new insight or guidance for those seeking relief from their obsessions with eating, starving, OR compulsive overeating. The author offers the same old platitudes about ""enjoying the moment"", but what good does that do? It's an empty book, full of ephemeral promises and platitudes but nothing solid to build on or learn from. Save your money and your time - you don't need THIS claptrap!"
1,wasted time,Time spent reading this book and following its tenets is time that has been wasted. The ideas in this book will lead to obesity and lack of self-assuredness. The author claims that one eat and become healthly just by paying attention to one's cravings.
1,Fat Acceptance,"Call this book ""how to get fatter without hardly trying"". A feel-good bromide for those without willpower."
4,"Concise, money-saving organization of your building project.","The author provides an easily understood yet detailed plan to organize the building of your home. Various steps of the building project are well-covered and crucial elements...such as legal requirements for lien waivers, insurance and code requirements are spelled out clearly.I found this book helpful in deciding if I would be able to manage the general contractor process, and was intrigued at the idea of saving up to 25% of labor costs. The sample contracts and other forms were a plus."
4,Very Good Overview,"This book is straight-forward, and easy to understand. It provides a generally good overview of the home building process and many valuable tips, but lacks in-depth detail. If you're trying to decide whether or not to build your own house, this will give you a good ""taste"" of what's involved. However, it's NOT an all inclusive step-by-step guide."
1,"Boring reading with no information, WASTE OF TIME","I read the book since I am building a house soon. The book gave very little useful information. I have been doing my homework on building a home and consider myself above average home building knowledge, but nothing I have learned came from this book. I took the book on vacation this summer to read at the beach and I finished it in a day. If you have some type of home building knowledge, you do not need this book. I can NOT think of ANYTHING positive to say. I wish I had another book to read at the beach. WASTE OF TIME."
3,Average,"It was okay, some footage was on other ""banned"" videos. Other footage was on channels such as ""Fox."" Overall though it was a good collection of ""real life"" events that TV doesn't want you to see, that I believe people should see. It somewhat illustrates the value of life and how some people really don't care. If those people who shot the clerks in this footage had a gun to their head they would understand how precious life is."
1,Waste of money!,"I just oredered this DVD and I couldn't have been more disappointed. The quality was horrible and this was less than I expected. I always like to read the reviews on things that I order if I am unfamiliar with them. It seems that majority of the time the good out weighed the bad but in this case they were wrong. It started out really slow and I just knew that the scenes would get more intense and more horrific. Out of 30 scenes only 5, at the most, were even worth watching. There were more car crashes in the scenes, involving people that actually took the risk, than anything. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone nor will I be purchasing anymore Banned from Television DVDs. Please don't waste your money on this garbage. You will be highly disappointed and wanting your money back. I know I do!"
1,NO GOOD !!!!!!!,I HAVE JUST BOUGHT THIS MOVIE....IT'S A VERY BAD QUALITYMOVIE. THE FILMS ARE SO GRAINY YOU CANNOT SEE THEPEOPLE IN THE PICTURE.. DON'T BUY IT..IT'S A RIP OFF...
3,Keeps him occupied,"Grandma bought this for my 4-month old. He really likes to hug it & lay on top of it. He seems intrigued by the flashing lights. My only complaint is that it shuts off too easily. Six minutes of lullabies is not enough & my son gets upset when it turns off. I have to continually sneak into his room to squeeze the hand for additional minutes of music. A crib CD player is a better bet. But for regular play, this one has been a winner!"
3,Just O.K.,I play with Baby Tad more than my 11 month old daughter. She does like looking at the lights and tries to push the buttons but her little baby fingers are too small to push the button so she looses interest. One thing that I really don't like about this toy is the volume control. There's only 2 options and one is too loud and the other is too soft.
3,I got the British version,"First off, this toy is very expensive. Second, it took 3 weeks for this item to get delivered to my house. Third, when my son opened it on Christmas it turned out that Tad had a British accent. It was very disappointing."
5,baby tad,"Baby Tad is a really great toy, at first i was kind of like, Oh great another annoying electronic toy, but it's worth the batteries. My daughter sleeps with that thing every night and she has already learned how to sing just about every song.(She's 2yr)It's a great toy for us to learn and sing along toghether. I think it's very cute and the sounds are great. You just have to get one to know. Thanks for listening to my review."
4,Great Light Show - Cute Sayings,This toy is wonderful and we haven't even begun to understand it's capabilities. My daughter is 5 months old and has enjoyed watching the lights on Tad since she was just a few weeks old. We keep him in the crib so we can just press a button and she can watch him.It has many different nursery rhymes and sayings. The off/on button is great to be able to shut it off when desired unlike a lot of singing stuffed animal toys. The kiss on his cheek is icing on the cake - and hearing him say I love you is wonderful. Perfect for nurturing your child!I'm hoping that this toy will prove to be educational in the future - then it will definitely be worth the price x's 50!
2,Too creepy for us,"Got this as a gift, and took it back rather quickly. Something about his voice and what it did just was too wierd. I've seen similar toys, maybe next baby we will try those. But this just wasn't our style. We exchanged it for something much cooler!"
2,Not a great buy,"My main problem with Tad is that he has no on/off switch. So when you are cleaning up all your baby's toys (usually at nap time) he starts singing when you touch him. Plus, he does not sing for a long time. He plays short little songs then stops and you have to press another shape for another song or he turns himself off. I am going to give mine away because he is just taking up room in the toy chest. My daughter never has played with him, she is 12 months now but got him when she was 8 months."
3,Pretty Cool,My baby got this for her first B-day and plays w/ it on and off. It's pretty cool but should not be as expensive. Can think of better toys for the money!
5,Great to Grow With,"My daughter received Baby Tad when she was 3 months old and loved to watch the lights flash and hear Tad and mom sing together. Now at 21 months old, she pushes the buttons, claps along with the songs and even says ""I love You,"" just like Tad does. Tad has been a great toy to grow with and I highly recommend him!"
2,"Difficult to push buttons, turns off quickly","My 10-month old daughter always smiles when I bring out Baby Tad, but in my opinion the toy is not very well designed for babies. The buttons, embedded in fabric, are really hard for her to push. After a few seconds of not having any buttons pushed, Baby Tad turns off automatically, bringing a quick end to playtime unless I'm sitting there with her pushing the buttons. Could have been a great toy, but I think they missed the boat."
5,My 6-month-old LOVES this!,"My six-month-old son absolutely adores this toy. He attempts to sing along and talk back to Baby Tad. The frog plays 4 or 5 songs and also has a ""night time"" setting that plays classical music. The toy is very interactive. Any time my baby touches it, it says something to capture his attention. Then he's sold, interacting for a long time with it. It teaches shapes, colors, eye-hand coordination, and singing. It also has two volume settings, which is a nice feature for parents."
4,Very cute toy!!!,My son who is now 1 year old got this for x-mas. He really did not care for it much at first. I put it in a small chair in his room and one day he found it. He loves to make it sing- loves the blinking shapes. He only plays with it for a short period of time everyday but he really lights up with excitement when he does. The songs are so cute. My son claps his hands to all the songs. This is a great toy that rewards baby for pressing the correct blinking light. It has a going to sleep mode but my son does not care for it as much. This is a very cute toy- I am glad we got it. Give it time I think it takes a little time to warm up to. ENJOY!!
5,Fabulous!,"We purchased this toy for our son, who is now three, when he was an infant. He took Tad to bed every night to play his ""night-night music"", plus he carried Tad around during the day. We loved this toy so much that when our daughter was born we bought her one as well so we wouldn't have any fights. Both of our kids play with their own baby Tad and everyone is happy! Our daughter, who is now 21 months, dances to the music and claps her hands, and our son still likes his too. Great purchase, worth having two in the house! Plus, I like how you can adjust the volume to quiet down for the night."
5,Baby Tad is the best!,My daughter recieved Baby Tad when she was 11 months old. She absolutely loves him. Baby Tad plays songs and tells colors in the daytime. Then at night you can play music for up to 6 minutes. This is a good learning toy for baby. Baby Tad has went everywhere with us from a car ride to a plane ride. He tells the child that he loves them. My daughter loves to give hugs and kisses to Baby Tad. I would recommend it anyone with a toddler. It truly is a life saver at times when your child will get fussy. We love our Baby Tad!
4,Great toy for us,"I bought this for my baby when she was 18 months, and she still loves it 6 months later. This has been a durable toy for us, and it has many different functions, e.g. song games, color and shape games, classical music. There is a volume control on the inside battery pack, so your little one can sleep with it, and it will play up to 6 minutes of music for ""night-night."" I think this is a great toy, and my daughter does too, but she still prefers her simple, old fashioned baby dolls to the tech. toys. :)"
2,baby tad very annoying,"I found this toy, like many electronic toys, to be grating and incredibly annoying. Children have managed to learn and grow in stimulating environments for thousands of years without irritating toys like this. Einstein, Michaelangelo, and Thoreau had no talking toys. Think twice before wasting your precious child's time with this one."
4,I love this toy for myself...,My baby hasn't come yet. But I found this toy most educational and interesting. I played with it for awhile in the store.When the baby comes maybe I'll share it.All in all a very good toy...I read the other reviews and I can't wait to put it to use.
2,Cute & Boring,"Add this to the ever-growing stack of stuffed animals in my baby's room. Oh sure it's cute and sings and has introductory alphabet skills, but what toddler sticks around long enough to hear it. My baby pushed the buttons, danced a little and then threw it on the floor, it has been in the bottom of her toy box ever since. I'm glad this was a gift and I didn't spend my own money."
4,Baby Tad is the toy to have,"My son received this toy for his 1st birthday and is quickly moving toward his second right along with Tad. This toy is just great. While a one year old boy couldn't quite grasp the concept of what pushing each blinking button meant at first, he would fall asleep to the &quot;night night&quot; music. A lifesaver on many nights. However, now that he's older he has grasped the concept of shapes and colors and follows the blinking buttons to hear what happens next. Very sweet and endearing toy. A must for little ones who like to push buttons!! And it does keep him away from the tv remote!!"
4,He Loves It!,"My 10 month old is obviously too young to do it himself, but with my help running it, he listens to the songs, oohs and aahs at the flashing lights and has even begun to coo at it."
5,Daughter loves him,Grandma bought for Daughter when she was six months. She absoluetly loves him! She lays on him and kisses him all the time. We bought baby Lily for her too. Not as good.
2,not a thrilling toy,"I have a lot of Leapfrog products for my 2-year-old, so I was excited to get Baby Tad for my 10-month-old. However, after the 1st 5 minutes of playing with it, my daughter quickly lost interest. It actually held my 2-year-old's attention longer, since she can recognize shapes and colors, and has the strength to press down on the flashing buttons on Tad's chest.I was disappointed with this toy for my infant. She doesn't need it to go to sleep (she already established her own sleeping patterns before she got this toy), so besides the flashing lights, this toy doesn't hold much interest for my baby.Ironically, my 10-month-old loves the Phonics Radio by Leapfrog. The buttons on this toy are easier to push for her, and the music is more fun too."
4,Excellent for Bedtime,"My son 10 months, got this for christmas, we like the bedtime feature, you can set it to play music for up to 6 mins. It doesn't lock all of the other features out though, if he hits the other hand while in bedtime mode, it will switch to daytime and start talking, I wish they would have made bedtime with a lockout feature of all other modes, I don't think the buttons on his belly work while in bedtime mode though. I also like the fact that you can turn the volume down. He doesn't play with it much during the day because we usually keep it in his crib. I wish it did more than say shapes when you pushed the buttons on his stomach. The kiss it makes when you push the lips on his cheeks is really cute, it gives a kiss and say's I love you. Overall this is a really cute toy"
3,Ok-not great,"The idea of this toy is good, but it turns off in 5 seconds if your baby doesn't push the buttons fast enough."
1,My Baby Tad is Possessed,"Received this toy as a gift and thought it was cute as it was the same size as my 5 month old daughter. They looked cute facing each other in pictures. Then, Baby Tad was unfortunately possessed. He would not shut off and one night woke us up singing and blinking up a storm. I was not going to the basement at 2 am to grab a screwdriver and remove the batteries so he went into a drawer and kept singing through the night until his batteries expired. New batteries didn't help and thus was the end of Baby Tad."
2,"A disappointment, and expensive to boot","This product is a real disappointment, especially given all the positive reviews here. It really doesn't do much. It plays about 5 songs, I think (Baa baa black sheep, Hickory Dickory Dock, Where has my little dog gone, and one or two others). It has 6 shapes on the front, and baby is supposed to press the one that lights up. But they only stay lit for a couple of seconds - not really long enough for a young child to respond. After that, it'll say ""Let's snuggle"" and giggle before shutting itself off. The voice is very irritating, too. My son loves music, but he pretty much ignores this toy. I would recommend saving your money."
5,We Love Baby Tad,"Baby Tad was a gift from my mother to my daughter. My daughter loves playing with Baby Tad. She loves the songs he plays and she is starting to grasp the concept of pushing the lit up button on Baby Tad's bib for him to say ""YEA!!!!"" and starting singing a song. I've also noticed that she claps her hands to the song ""If Your Happy And You Know It"". The best feature I've found to this toy is you can set it for ""Nite-Nite"" Mode. You press Tad's Foot up to five times and he will say 5 minutes till night night and for five minutes or however many minutes you set (up to five) he will play soft music and his bib lights up . This is great when we travel because the bib provides the night light (up to 5 minutes) and the lullabyes, no need to pack a CD player or music box for my daughter."
5,Great Fun!,My mom bought this for my 4-month old and he loves it! He reaches for it and is fascinated with the flashing lights. This will be a great toy as he gets older too!
5,Wonderful gift idea,I bought this for my niece's first birthday. She loves it. It is adorable and the music it plays is so much fun for little ones. My niece travels with Tad wherever she goes.I highly recommend for a gift for your special baby.
3,"Adorable toy, but sits in the toy box!","We bought this for our 7 month old boy for Christmas. It was so cute in the store, I thought our son would love it. Unfortuneately, after playing with it for less than a week the yellow star on Baby Tad's belly went out. It would light up, but it wouldn't allow you to push it. After that our son really lost interest. Now he doesn't even get it out of the box occasionaly to play with it. (He is 11 months now.) I really think it is a cute idea, and a cute toy, but not a great deal of fun for young children to play with."
4,Just Ok :),"My daughter received this as a gift. She likes it, plays songs and has a 6 minute night time music. I'm probably just biased but I prefer the Little Puppy of Fisher Price that has more music and adorable looks."
4,Great!,"My 9 month old's vocabulary includes mama, dada, hi, and Tad. Tad plays 6 minutes of classical music for him when he goes to bed, and some other (traditional - but the singer is really twangy) baby songs for when he is awake. The best thing about it is that when we travel, Tad can go along with us. Very comforting for a baby in an unfamiliar environment. Our baby hasn't yet learned to push the buttons to get the songs, but he's still pretty young."
2,Hard to use!,"The buttons on baby tad's chest are hard to press, his morning button (on the left palm) already broke (has a short in it already after 1 - yes 1 day of playing), it only plays up to 6 minutes of nite nite songs (ever tried getting your baby to sleep in 6 minutes?), you have to keep pressing buttons to keep it from say ""bye bye"" and turning off. She liked it for about 10 minutes. It's not a very good buy. I love leapfrog products but this one failed consumers."
3,Not long lasting....,"My grand daughter loved it and it became a nightly ritual for bed time. The buttons are easy to push to make it play. Unfortunately, the night time mode quit working after about 5 months. But I guess if you were played every night for 5 months you'd get worn out too. I will probably buy another for her."
3,Not worth the money,"I have three children and not one is really interested in this toy. My biggest complaint is there is no volume control so it really grates on your nerves b/c it is so LOUD! My 15 mos daughter hides when it sings b/c it is so loud. I didn't think the toy did all that much for the price. A better toy would one of the ball games, puzzles, anything else by LeapFrog even. Please don't waste your money on this toy...."
4,I just dont know,We got this for our daughter when she was 12 mo old. She could have cared less about it. She picked it up today pushed a few buttons and tossed it back in her toy box.
5,Great for helping baby sleep,"This is an amazing, sleep-inducing toy. I do not understand it, but it works like a dream! We bought it when my son was about 9 months old and although he wouldn't play with it much himself at that age (the buttons are a little hard for a 9-month old to push), he fell asleep every night to it. He still can go from crying to asleep in seconds when we turn the lullaby music on. As soon as he hears Baby Tad's lullaby, he just lays down and watches it and falls asleep. Now that he's a little older, he wakes up and plays with it on the play mode every morning to. In fact, I can hear Baby Tad through the monitor right now. It's very cute."
4,Wait till Baby is 1.5 for This,We got this around 10 months for our son! He had zero interest in it until about 2 months ago. He loves it! He loves it so much he plays it over and over and it goes everywhere we do. I think it is a great toy once they hit 18 months!
5,comfort toy,"hi, my son is 18 months and he enjoys tad so much he bops his head to ""where has my little dog gone"" and hugs tad and learned when he hears I love you he gives you a kiss...its great thank you leap"
2,Boring,"This is not the best of the Leap Frog brand. This toy is just ok. Nothing exciting - I have two boys, each barely looked at this frog twice."
5,Gets better with age.,"Our daughter, now 1-1/2 yrs. old still loves Baby Tad. He is the only thing that doesn't get tossed out of the crib and he helps us (Mom and Dad) know when she is awake."
5,Babies Love Him,I purchased one for my granddaughter and later my grandson when they were only a month old. They immediately responded to both the lights and sounds and 12 months later still are drawn to Tad. He has comforted restless babies for up to an hour at a time -- they just stare at him mesmerized. Tad has gotten a lot of use and is still going strong!
3,Great toy - but not very durable,We bought this toy for our son when he was 6 months old - it worked for maybe a week and then started sounding funny - we thought maybe it was just the batteries - but after changing them it almost made it worse -- our niece has this also and has had no problems and she loves it -- our son enjoyed playing with it and he likes to play with our nieces - but we just had bad luck with it lasting real long --- haven't tried to take it back or anything as we had thrown the receipt away. Disappointment for us that he doesn't work.
2,Boring Toy,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 6 months old, but she was too little to activate it. At 18 months, she still had no interest in it. She loves music, but this never caught her attention. I finally got rid of it recently since we don't have room for toys that she doesn't play with. I highly recommend Leapfrog's Dreamscape crib soother instead. I could activate when she was small and now she does it herself."
5,BABY TAD IS MY HERO!!!,"Tad is my daughter's favorite toy! She loves the lights and the music. She loves looking at him and grabbing him! She's loved him since the first time she played with him, and I am so glad I bought this toy for her! Plus, it's great because he's easy to carry along."
5,Great toy!,"I bought Baby Tad for my son when he was just 2 months old. From the beginning, he loved listening to the music and watching the lights. Now he is 10 months, and everytime he sees Baby Tad he gives him a big hug, and he can also push the buttons himself now. I would definitely buy this again."
4,Good toy so far,my dad got toy for my daughter and shes 7 months old. At first it was really cute and she loved it. But she got kinda bored with it but she still loves to listen to it. They should make more music on the toy.
2,If you have other toys that sing or talk this isn't worth it,"No great shakes on this one. I agree with others that it's a bit loud. My little one isn't terribly interested. If you have other toys that sing or talk this isn't worth it. IF you don't though, it would be a nice gift."
1,Completely annoying,This toy is annoying!! Tad's voice is obnoxious. Our child has no interest in the toy.I find the Leap Frog Learning Drum annoying too. A toy that we have that makes noise that I don't mind is the Fisher Price Circus Elephant with the blocks. For some reason it is actually uplifting and pleasant to me and other visitors. Our daughter enjoys pulling the string to make it pop/move and putting blocks (and anything else she can find) down the shoot.
2,So darn annoying!,"My 10-month-old daughter received this toy for Christmas and within a month I passed it on to a new home. She was indifferent to it primarily because it is a rather passive and repetitive toy and the annoyingly whiny voice drove me nuts! I'm not much of an electronic toy fan anyway, since the simpler, old-fashioned toys (blocks, balls, etc.) inspire much more creative play."
2,Baby show no interest,"I bought this when my DD was 5.5 month old. For the past 1.5 month, she shows no interest at this toy. The buttons are hard to press therefore even if she tried, she will get no interaction from it. As a stuff animal, I have to say not it is not the cutest on the block. My husband thinks DD is acutally afraid of it, that's why she won't play w/ it. :-D"
1,"baby tad for toddlers, not babies","hard for little ones to push buttons...also, why teach baby to push buttons? It's a Homer Simpson skillset.recieved as gift and dislike it, baby didn't like it until he was a toddler, then only liked it for 6 weekscooler toys abound, but grandparents seem to like this one"
2,Not interested,"Got this for baby when she was 5 months and she couldn't figure anything out. She's now 9 months and stll hasn't figured it out. She doesn't know that pressing the lights will play more music, let alone pressing the palms, feet, or the lipstick mark on the cheek.BTW - the volume control switch is on the face of the battery compartment. The settings are either REALLY low or REALLY high!"
2,Baby Tad is too loud!,"When will toy companies learn that this kind of toy needs a volume control? My six month old received this toy for Christmas and absolutely loves it. It is soft, colorful, and sings to her, what more could a baby want? The big problem is that it is VERY loud, so loud that I don't feel that is healthy for her little ears. It has to option of nightime melodies for ""sweet dreams,"" but there is no way a baby could fall asleep to music this loud. I will be returning it and looking for a similar product with volume control."
5,My son loves this toy...,My son absolutely loves the night night feature. There is a volume control on the back of the toy and (IMO) it was the perfect volume for bed time. You can press the night time button on the foot and it will play slow music for 1 to 6 minutes depending on how many times you press the foot. He loves the songs it sings in regular mode and loves to push the blinking lights.
5,perfect for little people,"Tad is great! She plays six different nursery rhymes and also has a button for some soft classical when baby is going to sleep. She talks and prompts baby to play along. When music is played, she lights up (not really sure if Tad is a he or a she, but her voice sounds feminine!). I keep her on my daughters changing table, and she keeps her occupied while I'm changing her."
3,"Must have gotten one from a ""bad batch""","My friend and I bought two of these for our children at the same time/place. Within a month of purchase Tad began acting strangely to say the least! It would get stuck in the ""Hi, I'm Baby Tad"" line and would not shut up. He would also begin talking and garbling for no reason (when my daugter wasn't playing with it) and we could not make it be quiet. The only remedy was to (out of eyesight of our kids) hit it until it stopped! We tried changing batteries, but that wasn't the problem. I have other friends whose kids love theirs-I think ours must have come from a batch with faulty parts."
3,"My son never got ""into"" this toy","We got this as a gift when our son was 6 months old. It's a great concept and Tad is really cute. I'd press the buttons and my son would stare at it for a while. Once he was a year old, he couldn't press the buttons himself and found other toys more entertaining. I usually play with my son and he is one of the more patient kids I know, but this toy never did thrill him in the way that other toys did. He's almost 2 and has other, simple, stuffed animals that he's ""taken"" to. I felt compelled to write a review because I just saw the price tag and I don't feel like this was worth the money."
5,GREAT TOY!!!!!!!!!,"A friend bought this for our son on his first birthday...he loved it then and he still loves it now! Plus, I think that Baby Tad is about the cutest toy I've ever seen. It sings cute and educational songs and my son loves to sing along. Also, it's nice to have a toy that will turn itself off and not stay on and waste batteries."
4,I love Baby Tad,"My daughter just loves this toy. She'll play with it for what seems like hours. This is a great toy to travel in the car with, or just to have around the house as it's a great distraction. She loves the songs it plays. It also has a lullaby feature to get her into sleep mode at night. Overall this toy has been a great addition to her toy chest and I would recommend this toy to anyone."
4,Perfect for my two year old,"We gave this to our daughter on her 2nd Birthday and she loves it! She has been learning her colors and shapes and she has been singing the little songs too. She especially likes turning on the classical lullaby music and listening to it whenever. It is very soft and she can sleep with it. It is good to turn the switch off after she is asleep because sometimes she has bumped him at night and it can be very loud, although he hasn't awakened her. Very good toy."
3,doesn't hold interest,"We received this as a Christmas gift, and ds loved it for a week. Now he won't even touch it, unless I am playing with it, then he will push a button and walk away and play with Toby the totbot. The night time button worked great especially since we were out of town and didn't have ds' music cds for bedtime. It is nice that you don't have to turn the doll off or on..I don't even know why they have a button, because you can push any button and it will turn on, which is annoying if you are carrying with a bunch of other toys and this one starts talking and singing, and the only way to shut it off is to take the batteries out. Like I said the off/on button is useless because it comes on when any button is touched.All it teaches kids are 6 colors and 6 shapes (together), and songs. The laugh and learn puppy by FP is more educational."
3,Buttons are difficult for some children to press,"My daughter received this last year for christmas at 6 months old. She liked it - as long as I kept pushing buttons. She's 18 months now and still has trouble pushing the buttons hard enough to activate them so while she loves it, she loses interest pretty quickly if I'm not there making it play for her. I'd still recommend it to anyone.Also - ours isn't 'posessed', and I haven't changed the batteries even once in the past year despite weekly play."
5,My baby's first kiss,"My sister bought my daughter baby tad. It is a great toy with a little bit of excitement and calmness all in one. It is very educational for a baby and is fun at the same time. I love the nightime selection for 1 to 6 minutes. When my daughter gets cranky I put the nighttime on and she loves it. Tad was the my child's first kiss, what a cute added little feature. Anyways this is a must for every child, I will be buying them for any baby showers in the future."
4,We love to hug & learn with Baby Tad!,"This was a gift to my little girl when she was born 3 years ago. She still enjoys playing with it, and her brother loves it too! It's definitely a huggable toy too!"
5,Never bored with it!!!,My 8-month old boy got this toy as a gift when he was a little more than 3-month. He has been playing with it ALL the time and never gets bored with it. The music is very pleasant and there is a volumn control that you can turn to low in the back (you have to unzip Tad to find it). I love this toy and would recommand it to anyone!
5,My Daughter Loves Him,My daughter (7 months old at the time) got this toy for Christmas she loves it. She still can't push the buttons on the front but she loves to watch them flash. She claps to the music & dances. I highly recomend this toy for any child. I love playing with Tad with her & watch her face light up as she giggles & laughs. Definitley worth the money.
2,"Help, it kills our nerves!","Our little daughter (6 months) loves it, but why does nobody think of the poor parents? The music is so loud that we cannot even watch TV in the next room when the thing is yelling ""YEAH! THAT'S THE BLUE TRIANGLE!!!"" Our child is not hard of hearing (not until NOW, at least)..."
3,"Cute, but not a favorite","We received this toy as a Christmas gift when my daughter was 4 months old. She is now 10 months and is still not engaged by this toy. She loves to push buttons on other toys, the phone, the TV remote, the TV...ANYTHING!! I think the smooth buttons on this toy have her stumped. I have shown her how and encouraged her to push the flashing spot to hear another song, but Tad always says ""bye-bye"" and the buttons stop flashing before she can push one.It's cute, and we still play with it (Mommy pushes the buttons) to hear the songs, but she doesn't pick it out on her own.She much prefers her Fridge Farm Magnetic Set by Leapfrog. I think that is a more enjoyable toy that will grow with her. Skip Baby Tad unless you need the soft night-time music."
5,Lifesaver,"At first, my son didn't show much interest. However, nowadays, it's the only thing that will make him go to sleep at night (the six minute lullaby music). Many a midnight cry has been soothed by Baby Tad."
4,We love Baby Tad at our house...,"Baby Tad is a cute toy that plays music, works on shape and color recognition and gives a little light show. My daughter played with Tad in her crib every morning...and I woke to his mechanical voice most days...it was better than the crying I was waking to prior to purchasing Tad.I took one star off because of Tad's stiff body...not too comfy for cuddling."
4,Love this Product!,"My son got Baby Tad when he was four months old, but now that he is 10 months old, he is starting to learn that if he pushes the buttons on Tad's tummy, they will sing a song. For boys, I would recommend this product for nine months+. I think my son was too young at 4 months, even though it was fun to push the buttons and hear Tad sing.Other recommendations: Leap Frog Hug and Learn Globe."
4,its a geat gift,well my daughter is 2 years old and when i first time i bought her this toy she was so excited because she kept hugging it and pressing the button that sings songs the tones are very nice and soft it really helped my daughter learn what the colors are and her shapes im so happy i bought this toy for my daughter and also my daughter presses the good night button that rocks her to sleep i hope this review helped you guysp.s. i hope you buy the toy to your baby
2,We hate Baby Tad,"He was fun for a while, and my son enjoyed the things the doll would say, but after a couple of months we'd really like to toss this one in the trash - it's grown enormously annoying.The only educational button on this thing is the OFF button on his foot."
1,lets learn (not),"My little sister had on of these and we had to take her to the hospital because it says ""push my nose"" and she went to push it's nose and there was a spike sticking out of it's nose and it went right through her finger and wouldn't come out.Aswell as that the frog didn't teach her anything."
1,Your Kidding!?! people/babies actually like this!?!,"My dad got this for my son for Christmas, who was 10 mos then. He's almost 13 mos old and could careless about 'baby tad'. I was skeptical but hopefull. My son has had virtually no interest in it at all.Ive noticed many of the reviewer's children sleep in cribs and this is like a 'crib buddy' (im constraining myself here). Id say sing, cuddle, nurse, read books as your night time/wake up time instead.your telling me that 'clasical music' puts your kids to sleep? Give me a break!!My son co-sleeps w/me and so this thing has little use for us.I dont think it teaches kids anything.It's boring and a total waste of money!!"
2,:::::::YAWN::::::,"My daughter never looked twice at Baby Tad :( I was really disappointed! The music is nice, but not very catchy for an older infant/toddler. The bottons are not the easiest for a younger infant to press either. Anyhow, I am sure this would be a great toy, just not anything my daugher liked. Our Baby Tad ended up being sold at a yard sale for 5 bucks :)"
4,Son Loves Tad,"My mother bought Tad for my son when he was 2 months old. We used the ""countdown"" to night-night every night until he was 2. He could not sleep without it. He still likes to play with Tad, but does not sleep with it any longer. (I took it out of the crib because everytime he would roll over in the middle of the night, he would push the buttons and wake himself up.) I am getting this for my newphew for Christmas this year and have recommended others to purchase as well."
5,Wonderful Toy,"My daughter is 8 months old and loves the toy. I thought he was loud at first, but when I opened up where the battery compartment is in the back there is a volume switch. So for nighttime I can make the volume softer and louder for fun tim during the day. I am very glad that I got this toy for her"
4,AN IMPRESSIVE ITEM,"When I saw this book, I was doubtful that the author could successfully do what he set out to do. But the result is quite impressive. The author manages to include words and arguments associated with Wittgenstein, friends and collaborators, and even even entries on modern commentators on Wittgenstein. The author always presents several opinions where they exist, and tells you which opinion is the most commonly held one. Along with excellent advice on how to start reading about Wittgenstein, this is a real winner."
3,Not for me,"Sorry Nina, I LOVE you and I LOVE big band jazz but this just does not work for me. I had to uncheck it on my iTunes. I will give you 3 stars because you and the cover art are so beautiful."
5,Wonderful,Tom Eagan might just be my favorite children's author currently writing. I love this book; I adore his Dodsworth series; I am looking forward to good things coming from him in the future.
2,"The documentary ""A Haunting in Connecticut"" is way better","I was so excited about this movie when I first heard about it, but all I can say is that it was ok, not good. I would recommend watching ""A Haunting in Connecticut"" documentary instead because it's a lot better. The movie was gross and you mostly saw the sick son having flashbacks or hallucinations. I was disappointed with the movie, but at least it made me appreciate the documentary a lot more."
1,Disappointing,"I was extremely excited to see this movie based on how great the documentary was. Boy was I let down. They made it a point in the beginning to have you believe that this really happened, while making up the most non-believable storyline. Well, the one thing true about it was that the kid had cancer. Do yourself a favor and see the documentary instead. That was WAAAAAY better and will send chills up your spine."
4,GOOD MOVIE TO WATCH,"Its a good movie to watch as it kinda makes us feel like it really happened. Its about a kid who has cancer and is fighting against the dark side of the house he and his family moved into. Excorsim is shown that is the picture in the cover. It goes back to some hundre years where the doc or exorcist kept all the body and carved them and cut thier eye lids and kept them. Its very creepy but awesome horror movie to watch. I actually watcted this movie in the theater and it scared the pants of of me , thts y i wanted to own this blu ray. amazing movie. If you like horror movies you will love it . Its not all corny like other horror movies.enjoy"
1,Poor movie,"Bad acting, nonsensical story, climax was dull. All in all this was not a movie you want to waste your time on."
3,It has it's moments,"All in all, I can only say, not bad. But definitely not spectacular either. It does have several ""boo"" moments throughout the film and the acting is good. I deducted points when they turned the plot into some fight of the forces of good and evil and it's the main character's responsibility to tip the scales. I really, really dislike it when ghost stories do this. Fear operates better with the unknown randomness quality, and they are often very contrived leaving me with the idea that it was written in for the sake of making audiences feel better when they leave the theater. When will they learn that not all movies need a happy ending? Real life usually doesn't and it adds some fairy tale quality that I personally, think has no place in a horror movie."
4,Another great haunted house movie.,"I would of gave this movie 5 stars if it would of stuck a little more to the true story it was based on and it did a pretty good job of it until the end. The whole dead bodies in the walls was kind of stupid, I mean could you imagine the smell that would of made, but the rest of the movie was good. Check it out, but dont forget to check up on the true story, it was pretty creepy."
3,A Haunting in Connecticut,"Movie centering on a family that moves into a house that was a former funeral parlor. Virginia Madsen plays a mother who's son is battling a rare form of cancer. It becomes a hassle to keep driving him miles to the hospital so they decide to move closer so that their sick son doesn't have to suffer on the hard ride. Little does the family realize about the house's history until bizarre things start to happen leading the family to think they are hallucinating until matters get worse. This isn't a possession type movie and the storyline gets kind of annoying after a while. As a ghost story, it isn't in the catagory of the Exorcist or Paranormal Activity and only became annoying as the movie went on. Buy it at your own risk or better yet, rent it from netflix so that it doesn't sit on your dvd shelf collecting dust."
1,Not worth $1,The best parts are the ones from the commerial promotion. Drags and is not nearly as exciting as any other movies in this genre.
3,"Good, up to a point","I have seen the tv episode 'A Haunting In Connecticut' and was curious to see how a Hollywood version would go, so I went ahead and bought this.The first two thirds of the movie were very good. There were some moments of high tension and a good few frights. The movie was getting better and better, even though it fell victim to a few horror cliches, (like the son inexplicably choosing the coldest, darkest, spookiest, dampest room in the house to sleep in).Then it seemed once a certain point was reached, the movie suddenly took a sharp nose-dive. The climax and the ending were pretty ridiculous. I was very disappointed that a movie that had been so good suddenly became tired and predictable.I think any horror fan would enjoy this movie, but the ending is woeful."
5,One of the best movies I own,"This is a difficult movie to sit and review. There is just too much that can be written to explain this movieSome people on here to write wonderful reviews, but some go on and on and on and on and I find myself fallingasleep. Everybody has their own taste.It is a wonderful and very cleverly made movie. Very touching, with that added touch of thriller/horrorincluded. Quite an unusual plot. A movie I have only owned for about 8 weeks and I think I have watched itabout 4 times ...... if you read reviews other than mine (good ones) Buy it!"
2,lame,"this ""based on the true story"" movie has it's moments.unfortunately forme,i just recently watched the 2002 documentary version A Haunting InConnecticut and this movie pales in comparison.there are certainlyquite a few differences between the two in terms of content andstory.the general story is still the same,but many of the details havebeen changed and things have been added and some scenes embellished foreffect.but really,it's all a bunch of noise and chaos.add a few specialeffects and some cg ghosts,and this really isn't any different thanyour typical run of the mill ghost story.lastly,the acting effort justwasn't really there.for me,The Haunting in Connecticut is a 2/5"
4,Pleased and fulfilled,"I received the DVD in good shape. I recently watched it, and there were no problems. I give the purchase a 100% satisfaction.R. HaseltonFT Lauderdale, FL"
3,Caution,"As of July 18, Playback problems are starting to be reported on other websites for the bluray version of this movie. The screen freezing is the most common intial problem. Proceed with caution."
1,Not very good at all.,"What we have here is a very unoriginal plot. We've all seen it before. Family moves into strange house. A ghost of the past tries to communicate, of course scaring the crap out of people in doing so. Eventually, spirits are freed, happy ending.z zz z zzzzMovie and acting was laughable. The family is just plain stupid for even renting a creepy old house they couldn't afford. Why would the mother let her sick son stay in the cold basement while she slept on the 2nd floor of the house? Scares consist of everything going quiet, and then a LOUD noise. After the family sees the ghosts, they still go about their regular activities of showering and sleeping alone in their rooms. Whatever, just dumb, dummmmmmmmb and boring."
3,One time viewing,This movie is supposed to be based on a true story. I've read all about the story and the movie goes way beyond what supposedly happened. The movie is very well acted and has its scary moments. The movie is about a family whose child has cancer and moves to Connecticut to receive cancer treatment. The house the family lives in was used years before to contact the dead and is haunted. The son receiving cancer treatment is the one most affected and after watching it I still wonder at some parts what actually was happening? Even though I may have not understood the whole movie I don't think I would watch it again. The movie is definitely at least worth watching once but I would not recommend buying the movie.
4,the haunting in connecticut,"the movie was pretty good,but not as good as the book. the deal i got on it was exceptional. does not dissapoint."
2,pretty lame,"I normally do not like to review movies because they are so subjective but this really was a let down. Based on true events..ok, but it was so Hollywood and jazzed up. That is not the problem, it was not scary because they made it seem like most of what the boy was seeing is ""in his head due to his treatements"" so it was more of a make believe scary movie than something that can actually happen. It was predictable and average acting. Watch it if you like this genre but do not get any high expectations.."
3,Dont beleive for one second this is based on any real event,"Usually these absurd marketing ploys at claiming a movie is based on a true story are 99 out of 100 times a load of b.s. This is one of those story's. The only thing this is based on when they say based on a true story is that the script really did exist and maybe a book, i dunno, but that's what it's based on, someones fictional story put on paper. So don;t be suckered into believing that a family really moved into a house in Connecticut and lame so called ""haunting's"" occurred and a cancer sick kid saved the day with the help of Casey Jones.However unlike these ideas that if you claim a movie is based on a true story, like that god awful ""Death Of A Ghost Hunter"", this movie is watchable. There is no gore, no horror, no violence, no real scares, but it is watchable & wasn't boring. I just wish these idiots would give up claiming something is a true story to get people to watch there movies."
2,The Original Story is Better,"This movie is based on a true story, and I've seen the original story on ""A Haunting."" I was hoping that the movie version would give me a creepier version of the original story, but all I got was bad acting, a lackluster storyline, and terrible effects. It seemed as though the director had an excellent idea in his head, but couldn't quite project it correctly. They tried way too hard to make the story ""better."" As a result, the story came off as cheesy and over the top. If you want to get a better and more accurate version of the story, check out the ""A Haunting"" version."
1,The documentary Was SOOOO Much Better!,"Leave it to Hollywood to take a really good creepy ghost story and mess it up with bad acting and unbelievable events. Add some lame CG and you have this movie. Looking at the stupid looking cover of ectoplasm coming out of the kids mouth has dumb written all over it.The original documentary with the black eyed demon was really creepy when I watched it late one night, years ago. If they would have just stuck to the original story and got some better Actors and Director...this could have been a really good creepfest. Why on earth would you add what they did and take away what was scary and creepy from the documentary? I don't get it.Save your time and money and if you want to see the really creepy version of this movie, get the documentary. I almost came close to walking out on this one when the CG came out of the guys mouth but I wanted to see how they would end it. I should have left then and saved myself some time. This movie is such a waste to watch."
4,Pretty scary for a PG-13 movie,"I think ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" is probably one of the creepiest PG-13 horror movies I've seen from the 2000s decade. The beginning sets a good mood for the rest of the film, and it doesn't take too long to get creepy. It has actually has really great scares and pop-outs that make you jump out your seat, and the story and setting altogether is really good. It also has a nice and intense ending that's memorable. Some people might not like this movie, but it's definitely and obviously better than a lot of the other PG-13 horror films this past decade. It's actually a good and intense film."
1,Horrible,"I am a fan of horror movies, but this one left me disappointed. It was boring and really wasn't even too scary."
3,Not based on a true story as told.,"*Spoliers*Some tidbits here and there in this movie really happened but as for the most part they really just had a hollywood fit and added a bunch of fake crap.1. There was never no bodies hiddin in the walls. or voodoo crap going on like they portray in the movie.2. The house never caught on fire.3. There was no kid who had special powers and could make the crap come out of his mouth.True parts1. The family did live in a house that used to be a funeral home.2. The kid did have cancer that seemed to go away as the kid got more possesed by the demon.3. The kid was cured, but not as how they portray in the movie. He didnt do no superhero crap, in the documentry the family has a priest come and preform a ritual that helps make things better.My opinion, dont watch this if you have seen the orginal documentry or you will be somewhat disappointed that they had the nerve to say this was based off a true story."
2,A mediocre film destroyed by horrible ending,"Copy and paste the premise of The Amityville Horror or any other similar haunted house movie, add some marginally unsettling imagery, a hugely disappointing account of disgorged ectoplasm, A PG-13 rating, and then completely slaughter the few things going good for you with a shoddy, cop-out ending, and then you have The Haunting in Connecticut."
3,3rd star is for the reality connection,"Just watched The Haunting in Connecticut and I am not impressed. I'm not overly impressed with the effects, they were minimal and not that impressive. (Grainy, stilted, not believable). I also was not impressed with the slow story line. The only thing that kept me interested was the fact that this is supposedly tied in with something that really happened and I am not so sure I am that interested as to see what really did happen, because the movie was just not that great. For die hard horror fans, maybe this might be a hit, but for a movie lover, this wasn't the best I have seen in some time. It might be real good to teenagers and young ones... but as an adult I still appreciate good horror, emphasis on good."
1,"a"" haunting ""story based on money making events !!.","yet another suppose ""true"" story ""haunting"" movie , based on nothing but fabricated events , for financial gain. this ""true"" story about a family who moves into a ""haunted"" house, that belonged to a mortician(with a teenage boy with a cancer subplot added no doubt for an emotional tone to the movie. ""sob"" ""sob"" ""sob"".) is a weak cross between a nightmare on elm street and zombie movie imitation, with its ""haunted"" dream sequences and lurking zombie(with didgets carved all over their skin) like creatures. this ""true"" story is about as frightening as a haunted toilet. how on earth do they expect intelligent people to to believe that this eventless drivel is based on factual events. warning!!! if you are looking for a good haunted house movie , do not hire or purchase this crap. a total waste of time and money."
1,No Horror + No Suspense + More like a drama + But there's no dramatic moments at all.,"My friend treated me to this movie in the theatre. It's one of the very bad movies I've ever seen.There are no horror, and no suspense. It's more like a drama. However, there's no dramatic moments at all."
1,A Haunti....zzzzz,"The most frightening scene in this travesty was the drunken rampage perpetrated by the father (Martin Donovan, actually very good) upon his family one night when the stress of paying for his son's medical care became too much to bear while sober. Other than that, this film is a snooze. The entities that were intended to be horrifying did not even raise my eyebrows. They looked menacing, the history sounded menacing, but it just didn't menace me! The house was creepy enough on its own, it did not need the ridiculous backstory created by Hollywood. What a waste of talented actors (Virginia Madsen, Elias Koteas). Watch the documentary instead - it is truly chilling and much more believable than this tripe."
2,A couple of stars for production design and visual FX,"And that's it. Other than some good production values on the house and some decent FX involving ectoplasm and spectres, there is really not much to see here. It's too bad that Virginia Madsen and Elias Koteas were wasted in this dreck. Some spoilers below....The story is widely believed to be a hoax, for one thing, which diminishes the potential power of it. Also, the writing on the bodies is never explained; we never really know what the deal was with Jonah and the others who used to live in the house; it's not clear if the boy was actually hallucinating because of his cancer treatments; the question ""Are you okay/all right?"" is used at least seven times, indicating lazy writing.There's also a lot of repeated shots of the same freaky images over and over again to the point of being tiresome; there is some very annoying use of strobe/flashing lights which gets on my nerves.There you go. Use this info to your advantage."
2,worst movie,"For this movie I have to say the trailer was the scariest part of the movie. The movie was horrible, but I guess this day in age, if the movie has a great trailer to reel you in they got you. As for this movie they got all of us. Jokes on us"
2,Pretty lousy horror film,"The Bottom Line:A horror film with occasional spooky parts (e.g. the flashbacks to ectoplasm) which serve only to highlight how mundane the rest of the film is, The Haunting in Connecticut never makes a lot of sense or makes the audience care about its characters; it's a quick money-grab that I sorely regret seeing in theaters and don't recommend to anyone.2/4"
1,very disappointed,Please don't waste your money on this one. It's nothing more than an old hippie's ego trip in print. I wish I had my money back.
1,some thoughts,"I have been following the recent 'discussions' concerning this book in the Welsh and Celtic press and thought, that to be fair, one should read it before epressing an opinion.My worry is that the claims do dot correspond to truth. That simple."
1,not my cup of tea,I have to say that I simply felt insulted reading this book. An insult to the intelligence.A preposterous portrait of Welsh culture and history.An insult also to pagans who do not wish to found their beliefs on such false claims
2,wheyhey,ITS REALLY READABLE THE BOOK AND ITS GOT A REALLY GOOD STORYBUT HE JUST DONT KNOW WHERE TO STOPYOU CANT TELL WHAT IS TRUEWHERE HIS THE AUTHORS IMAGINATION KICKS INI AINT WELSH BUT I KNOZ IT AINT TRUEPITY COS I LIKED THE WRITINGIM LIVIN IN CAERFFILIBOY HAS THIS MAN KICKED UP A HORNETS NEST IN WALESGOT THE BOOK IN HAYPEOPLE ON RADIO BEEN RIDICULING ITTHOUGHT ID GIVE IT A TRYLOOKS LIKE HE KINDA LIKED WALES AND DECIDED TO MAKE UP A RELIGIONCHECK OUT THE WEB PAGE AND LOOK AT THE CLAIMSYOU GOTTA LAUGHPITY HE AINT GOT THE SENSE TO KNOW WHEN TO STOP COS IT AINT A BAD READHE GOT SOME STYLEPITY HE MADE SO MUCHOF IT UPGOT THE OTHER 2 BOOKS ALSO - MORE OF THE SAME STUFFSOME FACTSSOME THINGS CHANGED FROM HISTORYLOTS MADE UP
4,A Wonderful Story of Initiation,I really enjoyed this book. There is a lot of hidden and metaphorical information revealed in this book. The common reader will enjoy this book as a story of a man who gets initiated into the welsh tradition of witchcraft. However the adept reader of witchcraft and/or paganism will relate to the symbology and gather an immense amount of information.I have spent years learning what this book teaches you in days. The idiots who give it negative reviews just have not read it. What in the world prompts people to badmouth things they know nothing about?
1,not my cup of tea,I have read many of the claims in this book and I can only say that they are not true.
1,dreadful,"This is nothing but a collection of badly-written fabrications typical of the worst elements of new-age Celticism. The author has little or no understanding of the reality of Wales and resorts to inventions. His understanding of Welsh history and culture is at best naive and childish, at worst misleading and dangerous"
1,u cannot be serious,read the online version. whooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa kinda like a horse outa control. goes on and on and on about wierd things. like reading a boring version of tolkien just more badly written with no plot - oh yeah - it claims it is real. right on man.
1,Very disappointing,"This book falls short in two key ways. First, the font used in this book looks like an old typewriter was used, and makes the book look quite like an amateur production. Second the book is written in story form, which adds to what appears to be imaginary material at best in any case.My impression is that the author has mixed together material drawn from the Hebrew Kaballah, Theosophical writings, biblical teachings, personal musings, and general occultism. There is nothing wrong with that per se, except that when one calls it an old Welsh tradition of Witchcraft then it becomes misleading.Unfortunately, misleading is what this book appears to be. Save your money and pass on this one (I wish I had)."
5,I was curious about the reviews,"It seems there are two groups of people who are writing reviews. Those who are for the Book and those who would do anything to trash it. that I don't understand. I bought the book a week ago after reading the terrible reviews because I just couldn't believe it could be that bad. It got here Friday. I was astounded at the insights that were revealed because of this book. I am on the positive side now, and have suggested that all my friends buy it. I can truthfully say if it had not been for those reviewers that did not like the book, I would never have bought it. Now I am hooked."
1,issues,Fel Cymro y mae'n rhaid imi ddweud nad oes a wnelo cynnwys y llyfr hwn ddim ag unrhyw wirionedd sydd yn ein gwlad ni.As a Welsh-speaker I have to say that this book has little to do with any reality that has ever existed in our country.
1,don't waste your money,My road to Celtic spirituality was seriously blocked for many years by this book. It took me ages to unlearn what I had read after I realised how untrue the content was.
1,weird,I have read lots of books about Satanism. They are all better than this book. At least I could finish those books without falling asleep.
1,my opinion,Frankly this is the most ridiculous case of drivel I have ever seen in my life. There is nothing but deceit and lies here. The author has already been shown to fabricate. There is no evidence whatsoever for most of his theories - he just makes things up as he goes along.
2,"Better than some, but far worse than others","This is certainly not all that the authors talk it up to be, but at the same time it is an adequate introduction to Wicca, even though the author now purports to be anything but Wiccan. If one looks at the story as given in the book as a myth, it can be the document basis for a workable Wiccan or neo-Witchcraft tradition.The down-side are those dratted historical claims. Gawr and Edwards take many ideas from Gardner, Buckland, et al...unfortunately, a fantastic and unnecessary false history is on the list of things dipped from that well.All in all, don't waste money on the full-priced version if you don't have to.J. Eiler"
4,Very Very Interesting book,"Well what can I say. I've read them all, witchcraft, welsh history, philosophy, medicine, But this book actually kept my attention for more than 10 minutes. Excellent Read. Don't know about the claims, but I'm waiting to be convinced."
5,classic toy,i am using this toy for work related purposes. it is a classic toy and and very functional for its intented use.
4,dolls,All my grand-daughters loved these doll because they could write on them and rewrite on then.Great gifts.
5,Funny!!!!,My husband and I are new to the world of children's books (we have a 7 month-old) but we love this book! It is definitely one that parents can enjoy. The pictures are great.
3,Nice book packing was bizzare.,"Very simple nice children's book. The box had enough room to fit 25 to 30 books with no packing! None, not any, 0, nada, nil. So in transit the book moved around in the box and since it was a soft cover magazine sized book a corner was dinged just a bit. well it is for a baby shower so my wife is annoyed. the ding was small and we will just give it to the expectant mother... Come on amazon a little common sense please."
5,THIS JACKET ROCKS,"I just wanted a cool casual jacket, this one caught my eye. It is hot, looks totally cool on me and i will wear it with my tight jeans when i hang out at the bodega. Aribba!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good Service,Even though I received the damaged product the refund was processed promptly to my credit card. I am satisfied with your service.
3,The connection isn't there...,"This semi-new direction in Kearney's writing had potential but this book was disappointing. However, if you're a die-hard fan of her work you'll probably enjoy it.To me there was something missing - and I think it had to do with the characters but I cannot quite put my finger on the problem. Maybe it's because Cade's acceptance of his newly awakening power takes too long and is too awkward. Or maybe it's because there is a lot of build up but the resolution and subsequent ""mutual forgiveness"" between the H/h was too quick. The ending really wasn't good in my opinion.I'm not sure but this book is NOT a ""keeper"" on my bookshelf!"
3,Interesting Premise,Not as good as 'The Challenge' but the premise is interesting and the content was very sexy as always.
1,BIRTHDAY HAT,"Oh my Lord...Please dont buy this hat. I feel sorry for every child that has to be put through the torture of wearing it. It looks so stupid! Its so heavy for the baby, as you can see in the picture that kid is soooo uncomfortable....Tell ya what---YOU wear a stupid hat for your next birthday and tell me how YOU feel! Just cause the baby isnt old enough to tell you to jump off a bridge with that hat shouldnt mean he should have to suffer looking back at pictures of it!"
3,Good idea but cheaply made,"End caps where already off in box when I recieved item, I fixed it but thats not really my job. I had to rerivet and tape ends onto duct."
1,Pass on This One,"Take heed. If you think you're getting a book that shows you how to execute skating moves, you aren't. What you are getting is a book that covers the obvious -- like how important it is to wear a helmet and pads. The only thing of value in this book is the list of skating ""zines"" and parks at the end -- which you can discover simply by doing an online search. My recommendation: Pass on this one. It's simply not worth the money."
5,What a thriiling book,Just discovered this author. This book is the best thriiler I have ever read. I have read Stephen King and Dean Koontz but this author surpasses anything I have read.I am looking forward to reading more of her books.
2,It Occupied a Plane Trip,"I didn't find the book particularly intense or deep. Maybe I've come to expect too much from the suspense I read. We too often disregard our 'hunches' and 'odd feelings', but this was ridiculous. When a home is repeatedly searched, don't you think someone could find one of those hidden cameras? With that much 'creepy watched feeling' running through the pages, I'd have been looking for something. Like one of the previous reviewers,I,too,skipped through the pages. I had the book with me on a plane trip. It wasn't a long trip or I would have been out of luck. I have no desire to purchase the cliffhanger follow-up. I don't have another short trip planned to waste it on."
2,Cost savings?,"Is the publisher attempting to cut costs by doing away with the editorial staff? Maybe they should look to reducing paper costs. This book was much too long, packed with extraneous details that could have been easily skipped over. How many silent conversations did the victims need to have with themselves and the killers? ""'Let me go,' she shouted silently.' Really?The story is a fine little suspense novel once you dig your way through the muck surrounding it. Ms. Jackson needs to remember that quantity is not necessarily quality. This seems to be a new trend for her--one that should be reversed."
2,Lacking suspense novel,"I usually adore books by this author, however I did not enjoy this one for several reasons. The killer drills victims teeth in a macabre dentists chair, I thought this was disgusting.At the end of the book, you know who commits the crimes, but do not know why. The author gives no reason for motive or why this person feels the need to drill victims teeth. Numerous pages were dedicated to how beautiful the heroine is, her body, how the men all melt when they see her. It got annoying. I would try another Lisa Jackson book, this one was terrible."
3,Pretty fair murder/suspense.,"But the first 50 pages or so were very boring to me. I almost didn't read any more. Then, once I got into the story, the suspense was excellent. However, the culprit was a very minor character in the end; there had to be a serial murderer with a motive, and one of the neighbors seemed just pulled out of a hat. The last chapter was an introduction to the sequel, ""Fatal Burn"", and I don't know if I'll read that one or not. If you enjoy romance and suspense, this novel is worth reading if you need something to read."
4,VERY GOOD,"In the style of James Bond. Very good DVD, which my kids want to watch over and over again. One the good Backyardigan adventures. Definitely buy this to add to your collection."
4,My 5 years old son loves it!,"Super SecretSpy has a nice music, but not so great story. I liked ohter two stories in this DVD more."
5,Even I love the Backyardigans!!,"My 1 year old son watches this almost everyday, it doesn't bother me because the Backyardigans are great. Sometimes I find myself humming the cute little songs. AND this is the only movie (so far) that he sits and watches quietly."
1,Save your money,"This is the worst reality DVD I have ever purchased. Every clip in this DVD has already been played 1000 times on TV. If you watch Real TV and Worlds Scariest pursuits you have seen all but three of the clips in this DVD. So basically dont give these guys your money, nothing in this DVD is banned from TV."
2,WORST OF ALL 3,I have all 3 banned from tv's and this one is the worst. Not worth it unless you get it real cheap.
1,Will not ever purshase goods from this seller again,I ordered a new DVD and the box was damaged and open. Not to mention the dvd was not include in the case. Amazon or seller has yet to respond to my claim and it have been over three weeks! A horrible experience to a loyal customers!
4,Hold your breath!,This is a very effective insecticide for the poultry mites that I have in my area (central coast of California). I was desparate to get rid of the mites that crawled up my hands and bit ME! But don't breathe in when you use it. It's a spray product and does just that - sprays! I had breathing trouble for several days after not using an adequate breathing mask. So just take precautions - use a good mask or hold your breath until you can get out of the area.
5,How can you not?,It's Nina Simone; how can you not love this? She is fantastic. There just aren't enough artists like this out there anymore.
5,true music!,"for some strange reason this album is considered not as good as their other two studio albums, the first s/t is closer to punk and the third (moving)is closer to reggay, which leaves odyshape somewhere in the middle, but that is what gives odyshape it's strange undescribable feeling, all through hearing this album you get a strong feeling that you have never heard anything like it and you never will. true this album is difficult and takes a number of listenings to know and understand and then some to love, but any true music lover that will take the time to know this album will not regret, this album is a pure mix of sounds and emotions, which makes it true music!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,My DD got this for Christmas last yr 3 1/2 and it has never worked right. My dd will put in a cartrige and it will say that is not a my 1st leap pad cartridge. I have tried it as well as my dh. She gets so fustrated by it. Not to mention if you actaully get the book and cartridge to match up the pen stinks and you need to hit things multiple times. Just a big WASTE!!
2,POWER TOUCH IS A BETTER LEARNING TOOL/NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED,"MY HUSBAND AND I BOUGHT THIS FOR OUR 2 1/2 YEAR OLD FOR CHRISTMAS.IT IS HARD FOR HER TO USE.WE HAVE TRIED AND TRIED,WORKING WITH HER,BUT THE CONCEPT OF THE PEN AND THE BOOK DOES NOT STAY ON LEAPPAD,IT SLIPS OFF FLIPS OVER.I WENT OUT AND PURCHASED THE POWERTOUCH BY FISHER PRICE,SHE COULD USE IT THE FIRST TIME SHE TRIED IT.NO PEN JUST YOUR FINGER AND THE BOOK STAYS IN PLACE.IT IS A SHAME THAT THE LEAP FROG DID NOT WORK,NOW I HAVE IT AND 6 BOOKS AND TAPES,JUST TOO MUCH TO KEEP THE BOOK STILL AND USE THE PEN."
1,DON'T BOTHER!,"My son is very intelligent. He's 2 1/2 and counts forward and backward, knows his alphabet inside and out, and he can easily navigate real computers. I thought this would be a nice side toy to amuse him. IT ROTS! It's not very reactive or precise. Unless you touch EXACT spots with the sensor pen (sometimes twice or three times before it registers!), the system reads something entirely different than what the child is looking at. How educational! Let's teach our kids WRONG LABELS for things! My son quickly becomes extremely frustrated and walks away from the toy. It's now sitting here untouched for quite awhile. I don't blame him. When I tried to play with this toy to better help him with it, I even had problems. JUNK! WASTE! THERE ARE MANY BETTER TOYS OUT THERE!"
1,Save your $$$$ for something else,"I bought this for my 3-1/2 year old. It's cumbersome, clunky, confusing and boring. Wish I hadn't wasted my $$$$$."
2,Not for busy toddlers.,"Since my 13-month son enjoys many leapfrog toys, I purchased this for him. However, this was a mistake. This leapfrog cannot keep his attention. He loves books and being read to, but this toy did not interest him at all. I would not recommend it for children who are just starting to walk, because it takes to much concentation and time to play with. I will return this product and purchase next leapfrog reading toy (for ages 3 and up), when he is older."
1,life doesn't happen at the touch of a button,"I do not think that electronic toys should be praised upon. Learning colors at an early age may make a parent proud, but yound children benefit so much more from real contact with human beings. Electronic toys make kids lazy and lower their frustration level. Also doesn't help foster better attention and concentration skills.Please parents be careful with these kinds of toys!"
2,Do not buy if your child is left-handed,My four-year old gets frustrated with this toy because he is left-handed and the handle to hold it still while you use the pen is on the left side. They should make one for left-handed kids or put the handle on the top.
1,Do not buy!,"I purchased this product for my 2 1/2 year old son. I saw LeapPads in every childrens toy section of stores, so I thought this would be a good learning product to start him off with. I was wrong! First of all, the book is too small and it does not stay in place. It constantly falls off the hooks that are supossed to hold it on and it is very frustrating for my son becasue i have to reattach it for him each time. Also the pages rip eailsy from the spiral bind that holds it together. The sound is awful and often fades in and out. I'm taking this LeapPad back and trying the Fisher Price Power Touch system."
4,a must-have,My 2 1/2 year old son received this for Christmas and I knew he was going to love it - I had no idea how much. I was most impressed with how easy it was for him to change the books and cartridges on his own. This is just a great educational toy that kids will love because it's fun and parents will love because they are learning something.
4,Its DORA,"I love the leap pad, but this book it my daughters favorite. She is really picking up on some spanish words from playing with this. The Dora book really holds her attention and the games are run for her. This is not a solo activity for infants. My daughter is two and with an adult guiding her on what to do this is a wonderful toy. If shes playing with it by herself, i feel she is not getting the whole benefit from this. Dora is less irrating for a parent to participate in than some of the other titles."
2,Disappointing prefer Fisher price's power touch,"I am overall a HUGE leapfrog fan!I love the educational value of their toys and systems.We received ours a few years ago and it has never been a big hit beyond the first week.The catridges often gave errors, the books never seemed to stay in well. and the kids often ended up frustrated within a few minutes. and my kids outgrew it very fast, it has a short lige span in childrens ages In my opinion. We recently recieved Fisher prices power touch and it is more age versitile and the kids are not frustrated with it at all :)."
5,I think this is an excellent educational toy,"My daughter loves it. She is 3, and we got this as part of her Christmas this past year. She has no problem pressing the Go button, knowing what to do, etc...it challenged her each time...and she found it very interesting. She has not tired of it yet and it has been nearly 5 months. now though, she is ready for another one, as she has mastered all of it. It is great for learning numbers, colors, shapes, etc., and has lots of games that they can play. I love the fact that is has music too."
1,Great When it Works,"We are ""were"" on our second leap pad. My child takes excellant care of his toys, so I really thought the first one that broke was probably our error. The ""on"" button sticks. So, he received another for Christmas 04. Yet again the on button has stuck. You are unable to push the bottom up or down. This means you can't turn it off, so the batteries run down. I tried to install new batteries, and it won't even come on now. This will be our last leap pad purchase."
5,Great toy!!,"I got this for my then 2 year old's birthday. At first she couldn't work it on her own, but she has since mastered it. This is the perfect educational toy! I am glad they came up with it just in time for my little girl. I like that the books can be flipped, so your child gets twice as many pages. This is definatley worth every penny. It will make you so proud to see your little one learning and figuring things out on their own."
2,The Leapster is better than this,"This is frustrating to my daughter, because if the book isn't placed just right on the pad, it doesn't work correctly....if it is a little off, it will give an incorrect answer...when the answer was actually correct.I do however, highly reccommend the Leap Frog Leapster....it is amazing...and my daughter has learned so much from it....including the sound each letter makes.I also recommend the Leap Frog Phonics writing desk."
5,Money Well Spent!,"I have 2 daughters - ages 3 & 5. I bought both of them leap pads for Christmas. The 3 year old I bought MY FIRST LEAP PAD and the 5 year old the more advanced one. They both love them. Especially my 3 year old who can sit for hours changing out the stories for another and then starting over again. I was considering buying MY FIRST LEAP PAD last year, but it didn't seem that there were too many books to choose from. I'm glad I waited til this year, when she was older and they came out with additional books. I bought DORA, JAY JAY, THOMAS AND LEAPS DAY ON THE FARM. It also came with a LEAP book. It is more than enough to keep her busy and each book comes with two stories (one on each side). It's definitely worth the money."
2,Don't Waste Your Money...Buy the Regualr Leap Pad!!!,"We tried this with our daughter who was 18 months old at the time. There are *very* few books that correspond to the My First Leap. They only seem to cover the pre-preschool level, and offer nothing for children who may need a bit more challenge.After trying this model, we bought the regular Leap Pad for our daughter, with some question as to how long it would be before she would be able to use it independantly. After a couple months, she was using it all on her own. She has eight books to go with it, and loves them all. What's even better is that the regular Leap Pad will grow as she grows, whereas the My First Leap wouldn't have made it through her second year.I would lump this into the catagory of all the other scaled-down products for younger kids. The better bang for your buck is with the regualr models."
2,Worthless,"My two year old son was very excited when I bought him the desk, but he quickly lost interest. He had to use the awkward pen to touch the green go circle on each page and sometimes the pen didn't work correctly. We tried replacing the batteries, but to no avail.We bought the Fisher-Price PowerTouch. It is much better. Not only will it last longer because of the expanded age range, but it came with 2 books, instead of 1. It is much easier to hold and operate. I highly recommend you spring for the PowerTouch. The extra $10 more than pays for the 2nd book alone."
4,Keeps kids entertained. They love it!,"I bought this for my son when he was 2. He is now 4 and he still loves playing with it. My daughter who is 1 1/2 years old also enjoys playing with it--she knows that she has to touch the pen tip to the book to get sounds.This is a great toy in that it is educational, fun, and keeps the kids' interest. It is also a great toy to take in the car on long and short trips. It is small enough that it fits in their laps without being too much to handle.The only thing I was disappointed about was that my 1 1/2 year old chewed through the pen wire, so now that doesn't work anymore, BUT, I have discovered that they sell replacement pens for about $5.99, which I plan on buying. They have plenty of books that the kids enjoy which go with this product. The Wiggles is the newest one I plan on buying this Christmas."
2,Not worth the money,"We have gone through two of these toys since they suddenly stop working. I bought it because the small size seemed great for travel and the books available were more appealling to my 3 year old. But the toy often gets stuck in some kind of loop and the narrator's voice will skip and jumble or the whole thing will simply stop functioning. My daughter has not been rough with this toy at all and it started having problems within a couple months of purchase. The larger LeapPad has been fine, but this is not an equivalent product. We've been very disappointed."
4,EVERY CHILD SHOULD HAVE ONE,"I bought this ``toy`` last year when my son was 2, now he knows the whole alphabet, recognizes all the letters and also started writing them down, recently I heard him practicing the phonics - and all these by himself! I only got him started in the first days, so he`d know how it`s working and everything went just great! The only problem it`s the cartridges, they get dirty and dusty and need some gentle cleaning from time to time; I didn`t know what to do and E-mailed the customer service and they replied right away with the solution. Overall: great idea! Piece of advice: try and pair it with RICHARD`S SCARRY tapes."
2,Don't Bother,Please don't buy one of these. Just throw your money in the ocean. Worked fine for a month. Then it began to shut off and not accept cartridges. Some of the books do not snap on to the unit correctly.It drove my kid crazy. New batteries don't help.
1,Get a Tag instead,"My mother-in-law got this for my daughter when she was either 2 or 3 years old. Sadly, this was one of the only Leapfrog toy that was not a hit. She played with it only a little bit. It did not hold her attention at all. In order to use it, we have to insert the cartridge that goes with the book into the machine. That necessitates keeping track of the cartridges and books and then lugging everything and the machine with us. Tag is much better. Everything is loaded onto the pen and all we need is the book. Besides, the stories on Tag are much more interesting and there are more activities."
2,Malfunctions after about 6 months-both of ours did,"We bought this for Christmas 2002. Our daughter was a little young for it at the time, so we didn't give it to her right away. When she started using it, it wasn't long before the stylus cord wore down. LeapFrog replaced it for free, but then other problems started. The cartridges weren't being read properly. Again, LeapPad was helpful to get it working again. Now even cleaning the cartidges as recommended doesn't make it work properly. Either the pen isn't working again, or there is an error message about wrong cartridge.We bought the pink version in 2004, thinking surely it would have improved by that time. We ran into the same problems right away, within 4-6 months.Now we have about 7 books that might or might not work...very disappointing.We have the bigger kids regular LeapPad in pink, too. We have not had trouble with that one."
2,Buy leap pad and skip my first leap,"While the intentions of this toy are educational, it is hard to learn when it does not stay together.The book does not stay in the system. It constantly falls out, unless you do not move it at all so, forget taking it in the car.I was so disapointed in this toy I threw it in the garbage after having it for only a week. I couldn't even pass it on to someone else because, it would only cause another child frustration. I did however go and buy the leap pad and my 3 year old loves this one the book stays in it. The books grow with her and she can take it in the car for long trips. Do yourself a favor and go straight for the Leap pad."
2,not the best travel toy,"I was so excited about purchasing this item as the main source of vacation entertainment for our three and one half year old daughter. Unfortunately, it was the main source of frustration. She loves to play on the computer, and we do workbooks together; so I thought this would be a good combination. It is if you are sitting perfectly still, or at a desk with it.She had difficulty hearing it on the plane (we were not near an engine). In the car, the spiral bound book kept falling off of the base. If there were grips holding the book on it would make a big difference, but at [item price] I wasn't about to rig one up myself.She was challenged in parts, but not enough to tolerate the poor construction, and the price. Needless to say, I returned it after the vacation."
2,a bit dissapointed,"I debated on whether to get my 3 year old the My First or the original Leap Pad. I went with the My First, but when I received it, I realized that my daughter was way too advanced for most of the material. I really think this is more meant for age 2-3. It is things like, counting from 1-10, learning body parts, colors and shapes. These are things my daughter knew by the age of 3. There are some good things for her age, but I learned that the original leap start has the red books called pre-math, pre-reading and etc. These books are the same level as the My First, so there really is no need to even buy the My First in my opinion. I gave the My First to my 20 month old to play with and bought my three year old the original as I should have done in the first place."
3,Too hard to manage solo,"I bought this a year ago, but hardly ever used it since there were only 2 books titles to choose from. Now that they have Dora the Explorer out, we dusted it off and began playing it again. It's a fun toy, as long as you are helping your toddler manage it. There should be a way to hold the book in place. As it is now, the book can easily fall of off the leap pad and frustrate both the child and the parent and cause innappropriate responses from the touch pad. Probably best to wait for the child to be a bit older, and read your child a book the old fashioned way."
1,Disappointment,"My son received the My First Leappad for Christmas three years ago (when he was 2 1/2). At that time he had very little interest in the toy. (No matter what the other reviews say....this is a difficult toy for young children to use without ALOT of parent help) Thinking the book was too advanced for him, I put it away. Over the years I have pulled the unit out and showed it to him. Still he did not have the desire to play with the unit. (he has a great attention span). Now at age 5, he likes it. (probably because he is starting to read) Even though the unit has never been used, it doesn't work. We have received different books through the years and the cartridges will not function. So overall, it has been a waste of money. We probably spent $40 on the unit and another $40 on books."
4,Dora cartridge is cute but too many glitches,"toy needs book to be held down better. Everytime book is lifted causes confusion. The repeat question prompt does not repeat the last question-0-just keeps rtepeating itself. Pressing go with everynew page is also annoying.the good features are, it keeps the childs interest, something new and different, does promote learning, my 5 year old gifted child enjoys it, glitches and all."
3,toy has NEVER worked,"I got this toy for my daughter for Christmas. I had wanted to get it for her for some time, but I was waiting until she was old enough. Anyway, this toy caused nothing but frustration for us on Christmas morning. I installed the batteries, and it wouldn't work. When we try to touch the pen to something there is no response and it keeps telling us to press the GO button after we have already pressed it like twenty times and nothing happened. It worked for two minutes, then stopped working again. Now I have to waddle back to the store (6 1/2 months pregnant) and stand in long return lines just to return the darn thing, then I have to go to another store to return a book I bought to go with it!!!! After reading through some reviews, I see that I am not the only one who has had this problem with this toy."
3,The Ups and Downs of Technology,"I have purchased several Leap Pads including this one and the Spiderman Leap Pad. I have to say, I think the technology is amazing and the kids seem to enjoy them. However, I have had problems with both stylus pens (almost like they have a loose wire, because sometimes it seems to work and other times the pens has no effect) In both cases it started almost immediately after they were each purchased. I thought it just a fluke the first time. This has made using them frustrating for me and my kids and we end up turning them off after about ten minutes of continued use. I am glad to see, that this doesn't seem to be the case with other purchasers who have reviewed this product, but it thought it was worthy of noting.Now, my daughter wants the Leapster, so I guess we'll give it another try, as I am online ordering for her birthday."
1,Disappointed!,"This started out being a great buy for the money. I am a school teacher so I have bought many Leap Frog products for my classroom. I bought My First LeapPad for my 3 yr. old. We used it about 20 minutes per day together. The first set of batteries died after about 5 weeks of use which I thought was a little strange considering the light use. I replaced them, then the sound went on it. It has finally died after only 8 months. I don't have the receipt anymore so I look at it as a waste of money. I am not sure if I just got a bad product or what. I have different kids handling the Leap Frog stuff at school everyday without any problems. Again, I am very disappointed in this product. It was a great educational tool while it worked. My 3 year old really had fun with it."
2,Powertouch seems much better,"I wanted a powertouch but I saw that this was cheaper and looked like it was supposed to be for a younger child, so I bought it for my 2 year old for Christmas. He can't play with it by himself because you have to do certain things in a certain order before you even play with it. You have to turn it on, but its hard to tell if you have turned it on because the volume is so low. Then you have to press go with the pen and then you can turn the volume up. Ethan likes the story on the top flip page, but only the one on the bottom works. It wasn't that imaginative either. Get the powertouch. Much cooler."
1,forget it,"Why buy this when they will outgrow it so soon? I have bought both the Leap Pad and Quantum Pad for my children. I have 4 children between the ages of 4 and 9. When I first bought the leap pad my youngest was 2. Both systems can use the same books and cartridges. So they can use them from preschool to 5th grade (or higher, I even learned from them). That seems like a better investment to me than something they can only use for a couple of years."
2,No longer making it!!!,"This was a great product; our daughter would spend large amounts of time learning off of it and loved it immensely. However, when our first one broke about a month ago, I went online to find a replacement. Only a few stores still carry it at all! Apparently leap frog is replace all of these with their new pen system.Advice: if you are like us and have 15 or more books w/ this system, buy a backup now. If you are new and looking for something for your kid, do NOT buy this, as it will be all but gone in another month."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this for my two year old daughter. She's very bright...she plays computer games by herself. I thought this would be a nice addition to her learning tools, but everything seems ""delayed."" The speaking is slow. The constand ""reminder"" to push the green button and the music...the waiting...is too much. You must sit and wait for the actual ""request"" (find the letter ""M"".) Then you get three chances; if you don't get the right answer, you're ejected from the game. (My daughter starts trying to find the answer before the question is asked.) I didn't think that was very supportive: three strikes--you're out.My daughter also has a habit of chewing. She broke the pen tip, and the pen had to be replaced. If you have a chewer...you must supervise at all times. I think it's possibly a choking hazard to younger children."
3,I like the larger leap pad book,"I like these books. My kiddos are captivated over the sounds that they can 'make'. My 4 year old learned several songs from the leap pad when he was 3, and he has still retained it.I have two problems with these 'books'. One concern is that the cartridges can get lost very easily if you have a curious little one, and you are not continuously watching them. Storing them was not as easy as we thought it would be.The other problem we have had is that with the use some of the books get, they rip pretty easily."
3,My son likes his first LeapPad!,"I thought it was interesting that so many reviewers said that it 'didn't keep their 2yr old occupied' or whatever. Maybe if they noticed that the product is recommended for children 3yrs-5yrs of age they wouldn't have had this problem - their children are too young for it! My son likes to play with his first leappad. It is a little difficult at first for them to do alone, but now that he is 4 1/2yrs old he has a lot of fun playing with it himself. He doesn't play with it every single day, but when he does, it can occupy him for fairly long periods of time."
3,"Teacher by trade, teacher at home",I debated whether to get the first LeapPad book or the second. I went with the first since my son was turning 3. The concept is great and my son liked playing with the pen and making the pad do different things but he lost interest quickly because he wasn't interested in the books we had. I am purchasing the second LeapFrog because there are more options in terms of the accessories (Scooby Doo) that he is interested in. My daughter (22 mo) loves playing with LeapPad so I hope she gets more use out of the toy.
3,go for the regular model,"I have a 8,6,3, and 1 year old. We bought a my first leap pad for the 3 year old last year. She prefers the original leap pad her older siblings have and seldom plays with the my first leap pad."
5,Wonderful toy for a 3 year old!,"If you have a precocious toddler, buy this toy! I have a smart but very active 3 year old boy, and this is one of the few toys he will sit and play with for an extended period of time. There are nights when he insists upon sleeping with it, he loves it so much.He has all three of the books that go with My First LeapPad, and they are all well-designed. He got the toy when he was a few months shy of 3, and at first he just liked to make it say the names of things on the pages. Now, he's starting to play more games with it. Some of the instructions are a little too long, and he gets impatient before they finish, but I think that will just give him more to explore when he's a little older and a little more patient. All in all, a great toy!"
2,Not good for a 1 year old,"We bought this when our son was 18 months old and he's now 2. He loves books, and have heard good things about the model for older children. I just don't think this toy is developmentally appropriate for toddlers, and imagine the manufacturer was just capitalizing on the success of the main LeapPad. My son and his friends just wanted to take out and put in the back cartridge, and seemed alternately bored or frustrated by the paper booklets."
1,Dont waste your money,"1 or 2 years ago i bought this for my daughter. It broke within 3 months. We tried to reach the company. We couldn't get it replaced. It would shut off in the middle of playing. And we bought it for $35.00. What a ripoff. It's not durable at all. It was only dropped once. The fall was about 6"" not even a foot in the air. Try some other leapfrog product. Something went wrong on this one."
1,Frustrating to say the least!,"I just purchased this toy for my two and a half year old son and must admit we were both disappointed and frustrated. The pointer pen did not, would not work! We replaced the batteries, turned the Leap Pad on and off, checked to be sure the pointer lines were connected--everything but when we pointed to anything--the go buttons, the pictures, letters, words--the only response received was the mother's voice saying ""please press go to begin!"" Needless to say by the end of our first session we were ready to take this toy back to the store for a full refund!"
3,Consider your child before buying,"My son is 3 and has both the regular leap pad and this one. I got him the regular one after being told by a sales person at toys R us that this one isn't as good for the money. She was wrong. The regular leap pad has some preschool materials but not the basics like writting, matching etc. I bought this one after being frustrated with him and the leap pad and seeing hte better material first hand from a friend. His attention span isn't long enough to sit and listen. We are both still frustrated. All in all I think it's a great toy but you need to look inside your child and see if s/he's ready to sit for something like this. On the other hand it might teach listening skills. We worked this into our bed time routine and he has to work with it for 10 minutes each night. I'm hoping that will encourage him to listen and learn from it rather than do it wrong on purpose to hear the silly 'error sound'."
2,Great if you love sexual stereotypes,"This toy is a good idea, but whoever put together the graphics needs to modernize it a bit. The female characters have large bows stuck to their heads and long eyelashes, whereas the male characters have no eyelashes at all. I have not heard the term ""mailman"" in 15 years but you will find it here. We are very disappointed.Also it does not work very well. Even if you touch the ""go"" button before playing with each page, it seems to forget what page it is on and will skip ahead without warning. So suddenly the ""canteen"" on the camping page is being called a ""robot"". Fine if you are older than 3 and can figure out what went wrong, otherwise your child is being taught the wrong words.We also found that the leap pad is too easy for our 3-year-old and we would have probably preferred to go with the harder version to begin with."
1,Don't waste your money! Leapfrog doesn't stand up for their product!,"My daughter likes her My First Leappad, but after several months use, the pen has wires showing! I called Leapfrog and after a series of frustrating phone calls, I find out that they don't make the replacement pen for the My First Leappad anymore! At first the customer service agent told me they have the pen and I paid for it. The package I recieved in the mail had an old leappad system that doesn't work and 2 pens that don't fit my leappad. When I called back, it was a 2 hour ordeal. Finally, I spoke with a supervisor who told me that despite the fact that it was their mistake, I had to pay to ship everything back to them, then they would refund my money! Not only am I upset by this treatment, but I can't believe they don't make the pens anymore. I have invested in a lot of books for this leappad and now it is useless. What a waste of money! I cannot in good conscience buy from LeapFrog again!"
5,My First LeapPad,"This toy is highly durable (been dropped several times). It is easy to use. If the child is to small to play the games, they can still use the pen to make noises and for it to read them a story. The books are not as abundant as they are for the bigger LeapPad but they are abundant enough for the age group. The sounds are clear (Dora's Spanish speaking is kind of hard for a smaller child to understand). The books are educational and my 4 year old still finds things in them that she missed the last time she played with it. It is nice to take in the car for longer trips and there are no small pieces to loose."
1,No Quality!,"I got this as a gift for my 3 year old, it is not recognizing cartridges I put in and if it does, it only works for one page then shuts off or it starts to make strange noises. I would not recomend it to anyone. It is a great idea but bad product. If they want to keep selling this product they really need to work out their isuues. Be aware, if you do get it, there is a 3 MONTH WARRANTY after which the toy seems to not work correctly if at all. Maybe, with all the reviews I'm seeing, they should just recall it."
1,IT GROWLS!!!!!,"This is my second one we've been through and both of them did same thing. It always says oops that's not a blah blah blah cartridge or it will gargle and make awful noisees or just simply shut off. I've cleaned the cartridges and tryed new batteries, but doesn't work. It's a piece of junk!!!! I wouldn't even give it 1 star!!!!"
3,"Nice toy, but doesn't hold my child's attention for long","My daughter received this for Christmas this past year when she was 3. I thought it would be great. I got it out of the box, put the book on it and put the cartridge in. She liked it but had no idea what she was suppose to do with it. She just liked that if you ran the pen across the page, the book talked back to her. She is fairly intelligent, but I think this would have been more appropriate for an older child with a better attention span. She hasn't seen it in over 6 months and hasn't even asked for it, so obviously, she is not interested in it anymore."
2,damaged toy and I returned it and am waiting for refund,"The toy came from a company through Amazon- called Alabamafinest. I ordered a NEW toy and a damaged toy showed up in a shirt box with one tiny piece of bubble wrap. After checking my records to confirm our order was as I thought - for a new toy,I returned it and sent a message saying I wanted it exchanged for a NEW toy or a refund. The company could not comply and said they would refund our money. We are waiting for that. So, unfortunately, I am unable to comment on the value of the toy."
4,Good for older toddlers/preschoolers,"My two and a half year old son got this for xmas and he really enjoys it. He happily sits down and will play with it quietly, or we'll use it together to play games or talk about what's going on in the pictures. The pages aren't as durable as you may hope for, and there are some flaws in the overall design scheme as the pen strap could be longer to make it easier for little hands to maneuver it, as well as the ""go"" button at each page...sometimes it's a very abstract concept for toddlers to grasp. You also have to be very careful that you've made sure the book itself is aligned properly and snapped in, or it won't work right.Overall, this is a good learning aide for children, especially those who enjoy reading already, as it helps them recognize words, the stories and games are great for reinforcing letters, numbers, colors that they've already learned."
4,very good educational toy for young kids,I bought My First Leappad for my son's 3rd birthday. He is learning a lot with this toy. He got a good jump start with ABC's and 123's. We have a learning session every day in the afternoon and the leappad keeps his attention for quite sometime. It's definitely a good value for the price. I bought another one for my nephew's birthday.
3,Got this for moving,"We moved recently from FL to VA. It was a long long car trip so we got this for our son. We also got one extra book. Well he loved it. We spent hours a day playing with it. Well once he got tired of it on the 3 day trip we put it up. Well somewhere between FL and VA is the cartridge for the extra book. I was so upset that it was lost. It was his favorite. This is a good toy but good luck keeping all the extras you have to have for each book. I think the next model needs somewhere to keep the cartridges WITH the book. Oh, and if you loose the cartridge you might as well buy a copy of the book because it costs almost as much for both as for just one."
2,My son quickly became bored with this toy,"He received this for his fourth birthday, played with it a few times and now wants nothing to do with it. He does not spend a whole lot of time on the computer but I think because he has played more sophisticated educational games this product is not fun for him. He is pretty patient and has a good attention span for a four year old so that is not the problem. The age range is 3-5 years but I feel my son is too old for this toy. I am going to let my daughter, who just turned two, start playing with it soon...I have a feeling she will enjoy it more. I can not rate durability since ours has barely been used, but I gave it four starts since everything worked well out of the box."
3,Confusion,The product only worked on the book that came with it and not the ones I already have. Leap frog makes it very complicated to match books and products. There is a picture on the book that says it works on the blue My first leappad and it doesn't. I wont order anymore things.
2,bad cartridges ...,"This game is ok, entertains my children for a little while. I thought everything was ok, but then, after only a couple of months, the cartridges started to malfunction! We have two leap pads and some games work in one, but not the other (and visa versa!) For the price, I don't want the toy to not work 1/2 the time after only a few uses. The books seem to hold up pretty good, but the cartridges don't. And, at a price of around $12 each, I was very dissapointed. If the cartridges worked all the time, I would probably give this toy 4 stars, as it is fun (when it works) and portable. One last comment for improvement, would be to have the volume be on the outside, not in the book, as the regular volume is a bit too loud and I have to ask my little one to turn it down each time she switches books/cartridges."
2,BEWARE: No headphone jacks on new models,"We had a My First Leappad 2 years ago for my son. In addition to its educational value, we really appreciated the fact that it could keep him occupied in a public place (he took a 2-hr airplane ride when he was 3 yrs old and the Leappad helped him be a wonderful, quiet passenger the whole ride).Our son has since grown out of the My First Leappad and it was no longer working right... so we bought our daughter a new model. HOWEVER, We found that the new one has no headphone port. It is no longer suitable for the airplane rides, busy car trips, doctor's office, etc because it is too noisy.Big disappointment."
3,not worth the money,"We bought this for my 2 year old daughter for Christmas, along with 6 books. It was fun for my daughter the first couple months then it started acting weird. Even after changing the batteries the unit would not accept the cartridges, it would just turn off while she was playing a game, very strange noises would come from the unit for no reason and it was hard to turn on. Needless to say for a 2 year old this was way too much work to enjoy playing with it. She would get very frustrated when in the middle of a game the thing would just stop working. For the money we spent on the unit plus all the extra books, it was a total waste of money. This toy needs major improvements, or it should be a whole lot cheaper, at least then you can say you get what you pay for. Never again!"
3,Toy Buying Mom,"This toy is a lot of fun for my 2 year old son. Although he loves it, it is also frustrating for him because it tells him he is incorrect when he is not. This mainly happens on the page where he must identify body parts. Even I could not get the LeapPad to identify the correct body parts. I think I would wait to purchase this until next year when they have more of the bugs worked out."
5,"Very informational text, highly recommended","I used this text for my Radiation Measurements lab, with Dr. Tsoulfanidis. He is an extremely knowledgable man, and it comes across in the book. Very understandable and VERY informative."
5,best book,i have learnt this book with keen intrest . this is a beautiful book . i am much inspired to read this book . of course it is a best book of this year......................................................................
2,SLOW SLOW SLOW,"Slow is the word for this. The tempo is slow. There's no spirit. Frank's voice just DRAGS. Merman's voice grates on the ears. I give her credit for putting some energy into it...but I can't say that there was as much as there was in...say, Gypsy. It seems as though all the songs are slowed down. Maybe all the recordings made afterward, such as the revival, and the television cast with Mary Martin, were speeded up. But I must say that this recording is rather dull."
4,Ethel Merman did ruin it.,"I told myself that I'd take the Ethel Merman version and like it.I decided this CD had less songs than the Betty Hutton; that would just make it easier. Boy, was I dumb! Man, Ethel Merman has always subtly rubbed me wrong---I cannot see her as Annie Oakley, either. She doesn't have the innocence and I so cannot picture that woman youthful to play Annie either. BUT it is good.Tolerable. Just don't listen to it too much. She'll get to you.And you know, when you have, ""I've got the sun in the morning and the moon in the evening..."" stuck in your mind and you play it over and over, your'e in Ethels territory.I recommend the Betty Hutton one. Because Annie is about being brash and uncultured. But Ethel and Judy are---well, Ethels brash but shes known as a singer. I think you have to keep it in character and belt the hell out of it---exactly like someone untrained and UNTAMED should do. Go BETTY!"
2,It's OK for an album of Ethel Merman singing Berlin songs.,"This is a fine album if you want to hear Ethel Merman singing Irving Berlin tunes. However, if you want to hear a performance of ""Annie Get Your Gun"" with some real acting, this isn't it. Ethel Merman's voice MAY be much better but my 17 year old daughter played the part with a lot more feeling in her school play. For instance, ""Moonlight Lullaby' HELLO... it's supposed to be a lullaby not an aria. Another example, ""Doing What Comes Naturally"" is supposed to be when Annie Oakley was an uneducated hillbilly and the accent in this version just isn't there. Some of this may be a proud papa speaking but I just can't buy Ethel Merman as anything other than Ethel Merman."
5,This one is a hit with my kids! They are learning and loving it!,"Among the Pond People is one my kids can't get enough of. It shares stories of ""pond people"" (frogs, minows, birds, insects) in a lively and fun way while introducing the children to how these animals live and fun facts about them. My kids are learning lots about pond life. They BEG me to read ""just one more chapter""! It is a true gem. We look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series."
5,Best Bra Ever,"I'm a bit heavy on top and it's difficult to find bras in my size except online. This is one of my favorites. Weather or not it minimizes much, it's got great support, it's pretty, and it's comfortable. It is a tad scratchy until it's been washed a couple of times, but this is a common issue I've found with bras."
2,not what I expected,I thought the bra looked really comfy in the picture. When I got it it was itchy so I washed it. Washing the bra did not make it any softer.
4,"Looks great, but feels snug","This bra looks great on and under clothes, but by the end of the day it feels restrictive. I like to wear it under clothes where a smaller bust looks best, but not if I have to wear it more than 8 hours!"
3,Disappointing port of an okay sequel,"Having played all of the previous Rainbow Six games, I was glad to see Raven Sheild available just as I got a new g5. It's just as carefully put together and realistic as the previous versions, if not better. The AI has clearly improved, but there were few other major improvements since the last release. The big, showstopping flaw? The Mac port does not allow netplay against PC users. Get Ghost Recon instead, or UT 2004."
5,Mac's Kick ass again!,Clancy does it again folks and if your lucky enough to be playing this game on the new Mac G-5 with a top of the line Graphics card (128 pro) get ready for the best gaming expierence their is out there. Puts any PC availible to absolute shame. Top of the line graphics as well as super fast game play and no freeze up no matter how much ass kickin you do. Turn on the options on MAX and enjoy it the way it was meant to be done.
3,No Save Feature,"The graphics are very good. This is a game that requires a lot of planning and memorizing keypad commands, but this can be fun once you've learned your way around.The huge con: No Game Save feature. You can spend lots of time getting nowhere. Wanna buy mine?"
5,warn241,This is an excellent follow-up to Ghost Recon with believable scenarios. It's not easy to winbut it's worth the effort.
4,"Good fun game, But better with the PC","First off I have to say that the PC version is about 1,000 times better with the best multiplayer, graphics, and fun factor over poor old Mac. However the Mac version does sport some good visuals and even the same rag doll physics as PC. Way, Way to easy to die but that is the way it is in real life and Tom Clancy won't be making anything that isn't the most realistic in the shooter franchise. Good plot, Decent Graphics, Not to Mention Domingo ""Ding"" Chavez a.k.a. coolest sniper ever! But if you own a Mac for gaming there is something wrong with you so buy this game if you are a moderate fan because sadly, if you want the best computers have to offer Billy Gates will always be the one with the goods."
2,Ebercises for Active Senors,Not enough of a work out for my taste. To easy. I'm looking for more exercise to raise my heart beat.
3,Not for every use...,"The product is well made, although it ""unwinds"" quite easily. You have to treat it gently to keep from ruining it. I ordered this item because my portable a/c requires a 5"" duct and they're hard to find. Unfortunately, it turns out that it wouldn't fit my a/c. The ""screw on"" coupling on the a/c actually needs the white plastic vent, not a metal one. Because I'd damaged the product before I figured that out, I didn't bother to return it (after all, it was my fault). I just wanted to post a warning to other a/c users that, if you have a screw on coupling, this might not work for you."
4,"""A Midnight Clear"" Response","The copy of ""A Midnight Clear"" was as described when I ordered it. The delivery was very prompt. I got what I ordered and what I paid for. I will try to find a hardcover edition later, perhaps from the same seller since I was pleased with their service.All in all, I am quite satisfied with my purchase."
5,Finally!,"If you're looking for a book on how precious babies are and how complete a woman feels once she's given birth, this is not your book. But, if you're someone who feels alienated by books like that and have been looking for the antidote to pedantic parenting guides and new mommy chick lit, look no furthur. This book is hilarious and so relatable. During my first few years of parenting I thought I never find a kindred spirit. Someone who didn't want to solely discuss the ins and outs of potty training and preschools, someone who understood the difference between Sauza and Tres Generations. Well, this is that person. I just need to make her my friend."
2,A dissapointment,"I expected this book to be funny, but other than a few hints at humour I didn't find anything to laugh about. The book had little to do on a take on motherhood and had too many diversions to other topics. It could very aptly have been titled something else."
4,Not an ordinary mom,It has some over the top moments but all in all a newmother will be able to relate to a lot of it.
1,Deep and Funny. NOT!,"I picked this book from the new book section of the library after perusing a few pages. I initially thought that it was funny, but on reading the whole book it became so tiresome listening to the author go on chapter after chapter about how cool she is, even WITH a child! I kept trying to figure out what her larger point was, but that seems to be it: she has children and she is COOL.I don't know if living in Hollywood has sucked all depth or meaning from the author's life, but that's what this book portrays. Not only is life about YOUR yoga class, YOUR brushes with minor celebrities and YOUR Friday nights at the bar, motherhood seems to be all about YOU. About halfway through the book, I started to count where she writes about her child or parenting in any active manner. My count confirmed that this is a mommy book devoid of children. Children and motherhood are the SET UPS for jokes about her life. Too bad the jokes themselves are not funny."
5,Rogers first purchase,"this was the first time my husband searched the internet. he went to your site and reviewed the variety of different items available. it was easy for him and that was important to me. the item was exactly what he wanted, so he ordered it. the package was delivered ahead of the estimated date. THANK YOU"
1,you did show another picture in the brochure with cables and baggage,"the first time i saw this item at the brochure it was a photograf upon a table telling that was refurbished item, it was with a metalic case opened with the power inverter and cables inside , why do you lie to costumers? when i got shipped the power inverter it was without case, cables, i really bought this refurbished item thinking, well it comes with case and cables, what a lie..........."
3,Uneven album,"This is a promising start from Unruly Child, although it is very uneven in its quality. The good songs are indeed very good, with lots of hooks and catchy melodies that stick from the start. The best songs are Heart Run Free, Rise Up and Forever. Unfortunately there are also songs that aren't up to my high standards, but that doesn't mean that they are no good, simply average. Nonetheless, this is an album well worth listening to."
1,Intellectual puffery?,"It's true: hard questions need to be asked. Our society's fetishization of technological progress and free markets should be challenged, and the best role for the Krokers and similar critics is poking the hornets' nest and seeing who gets stung.But there are bigger questions when studying Data Trash, Hacking the Future and the Krokers' other techno-dystopian tomes: does all this jargon and rhetoric actually add up to anything? The Krokers have been great at stirring the pot, but seem to have some fundamental misconceptions about the nature of technology and how, in a practical sense, it is accepted or rejected by people.Instead of just talking about economic culture and gloabalization, the Krokers wrap everything in hackeresque techno-babble, and instead of driving their points home, all we get is muddle."
1,Nothing about hacking,"This book has nothing to do with hacking. In fact, it has very little to do with technology at all. Instead, Hacking the Future can best be described as a series of art college-style attacks on obviously misunderstood technology."
5,Scholar's Library Series X,"You won't find better Bible software than this one. It puts an entire Library with state of the art search capability at your fingertips. Also, for those who use the original Biblical languages, this is a real time saver.Perry Webb(...)"
3,Pretty but small,These were very pretty but arrived much smaller then I anticipated. I bought them for a 14 year old girl for Christmas and suspect they may be more intended for someone maybe 8-10.
5,A wonderful addition to a Pixar classic,"This book is full of wonderful, imaginative illustrations that show the time and effort that was placed into Monsters Inc. The numerous different illustrators that have provided work make this collection of images a delight. There is very little text and explanation to go along with the images, but this is exactly what I was looking for. Its interesting to see how many changes the characters appearances went through to reach the final animated film. A definite buy for any fan of Pixar."
2,Not nearly enough!,"I was truly dissapointed after cracking open a recent order of ""The Art of Monsters Inc."" Previous editions of the Pixar Legacy have overflowed with good stuff. Unfotunately this volume only skims the surface of what surely rests in the vaults. (Quite possibly Pixar might not like us to know what goes on behind the scenes.)Liken it to the out of print ""Before the Animation Begins: The Art of Disney Inspirational Sketch Artists"". But without the zest of Tengren and others. (Carter Goodrich lends some marvelously different takes on the monster feeling.)The multitude of pastel mood pieces are lively and beautifully done but overall this book lacks the superflous character development and animation insight of it's predecessors.I will eagerly await a follow-up volume that might come remotely close to The Arts of Bugs Life and Toy Story. PLEASE!"
2,MOUSE HANGS!,"Great product except for critical mouse hangs. Have chased this to death. Once it hangs, only recovery is reboot. Then, after reboot you need to get the device working again: requires a witch-doctor religious ritual: TRY_AGAIN_LABEL: pressing 'connect' button on receiver, then removing and reinserting batteries from mouse -and- pressing mouse's connect button before window on screen times out. If it doesn't work, goto TRY_AGAIN_LABEL -- three or four times usually does it!"
5,Best kb/mouse combo ever,I've had two sets of these for years now and I love them! One got a bunch of booze dumped in it at a party last week so I took it outside and hosed it real good. Let it dry for a few days and it's back to working great again!
5,versatile and convenient.,"I had it for a few months now. Used to have a big Microsoft natural multimedia keyboard.Likes:Keyboard battery hasn't run out yet after a few months.Keyboard is pretty light.Rechargeable mouse will save you a lot of battery in the long run.Keyboard wireless range is pretty good, at least 10 ft.Area it can improve:somehow I never use most of the buttons on the keyboard.Mouse should have more battery capacity. it runs out quick if you play games, due to the moving it has to process.Mouse wireless range is not great, I can see the cursor moving but the clicks stop responding at around 6 ft. It's worse if your desk is cluttered, whose isn't!Overall, totally recommend it, I can't go back to wires. At recent prices, I found it from whosave dot coom, which shows online sales, it's a sure buy."
2,Scroll Wheel Issue & Programmable Keys,"I've had this keyboard and mouse combo for some time. While I do like being wireless, I've found myself having to switch to the Microsoft model for one reason. The scroll wheel is very useful, but Logitech has designed it with slight clicks, or detents in the wheel. While some claim this is useful for precision, I've found it no help, and actually a problem. After a few weeks, the constant click pulse from the wheel hurts your finger after awhile. Kind of like chinese water torture. At any rate it got so bad that I had to switch to the smooth scrolling mouse from Microsoft, and life is much better. Maybe this is not an issue for others, I'm not normally sensitive to such things, but I thought I'd better convey my experience. If these things don't bother you, then proceed!Also, the software that maps the extra buttons to useful functions does not work well. I tried all available updates."
3,great keyboard mouse needs improvment,Well the keyboard works great had this for about 3 week now but the mouse movement neds alot of work it jumps all over the screen i love playing first person shooters but with the mouse its nearly impossible to play ya you can but you cant make sligh tmovements with the mouse
4,great but..,"this is a great product! the wireless is great especially when just want to use the mouse on my leg when my arm hurts. I have noticed a problem with the mouse and games. The mouse tends to not work so greatg with the Simsand a few other games in which it sometimes doesnt move, but if you just minimize the game and change channels it tends to work again. Thats my only complaint with this product"
5,I love this keyboard and mouse set.,I have been using it for over a year now and I have not had any problem with it.I even use a KVM so I can use it on more then one computer at a time and that works just great.I really can not say much more then this is a great keyboard and mouse.
3,"Great hardware, frustrating software","I purchased this combo as part of an entire new system I built. While the keyboard and mouse are well built, have great features, and are very comfortable to work with, I've had continued problems with the mouse and/or getting disabled due to some XP startup services (or the loading sequence of these startup services). Of course, since it's a cordless system, you're dead in the water the second both stop functioning, which makes troubleshooting pretty difficult!In the end, I've at least been able to get it to work at >90% reliability, but I've had the set boxed up and ready to return several times out of frustration."
2,Battery charger doesn't work,"I bought one of these keyboard/mouse duos and have loved it up until now. The problem w/ mine is that the battery cradle/charger doesn't charge the rechargable batteries. I've gone out and bought new rechargable batteries as Logitech suggested, but now those aren't working either. It's evident the charger doesn't work. I bought one of these for a family member too and they're experiencing the same problems as me. On the more positive side of this.. the keyboard works like a charm."
4,Not good for notebooks,"My primary machine is a notebook running Windows XP Pro, which I take back and forth between work and home. At home, connected via the PS2 ports and a docking station, the combo works great, and I have zero complaints. At work, where I have to connect directly to the notebook via the USB port, there are problems. Usually either the mouse or keyboard will not work upon start-up. When they are working, there is often some functionality missing (one or more of the buttons do not work). After a few minutes of using the combo, both would then stop working. I tried all of the troubleshooting techniques, and the only one to work was unplugging and reinserting the cable. Needless to say, this is not something you want to do every 5 minutes.If you are going to use this setup attached to a desktop or docking station, it's fabulous. I can't recommend it for a notebook setup, however."
5,Great Product!!,"I may say this is the best keyboard and mice combo I have ever tried. I've had one before, the mouse quit on me so I went to a Cordless Laser one. I even contacted Logitech Support on it. They were good enough to send me another one, but not the Duo.There is no comparison which is the best. The Cordless Mx Duo is!! You really get your moneys worth out of this one.Logitech Cordless MX Duo 967300-0403"
1,One Flaw,The biggest flaw in this book is that Brown does not deal with the fact that Ancient Israel and Second Temple Judaism believed in a three level universe. Biblical authors thought the earth was the center of the universe (and probably thought the world was flat) and Brown based all of his theology on those ancient concepts.
1,"Good idea, poor sound quality","I bought this retractable headset because I was tired of winding up the cord on my cellular phone headset whenever I was done talking. While the retractable feature works great, the sound quality on the earpiece is very muffled and it makes it difficult to understand what the person on the other end is saying."
1,How does Ziplinq stay in business?,"These guys must have a great markup for retailers or something; why would so many stores bother to carry such a bad product? I see this brand everywhere so I assumed it must be OK. I was wrong.I used mine rarely - maybe ten to twelve times - before it stopped retracting fully. The sound is OK, but the earpiece falls out constantly. It's not a good use of your $6, get something else instead."
1,"Good idea, poor sound and construction","This thing was great for the one week that it worked. The sound is bad even for cheap earbuds, but I mostly listen to audiobooks and I was happy as a clam until it quit retracting properly. I was careful with it, because it's of noticeably cheap manufacture, but my care did me no good. It broke in about 1 week. Too bad. Good idea, shabby execution."
5,Love it.,"My dog is not a puppy, but the vet recommended a shampoo for puppies because his skin is somewhat sensitive. I've been using this product for months now and my dog's coat is clean and soft."
3,Pros and Cons with this Shampoo,"There are pros and cons to this shampoo. I had been shampooing my dog with VPS Hypoallergenic Shampoo and loved it. She smelled clean and fresh for a couple of weeks, no smell. But I switched to this shampoo and after shampooing her in the morning she smells already at the end of the day. Her hair is very soft after using this, and because I have her on a very healthy dog food, Merrick. Not sure why she's smelly now. I think I'll try something else and see what happends, then I'll update my review."
2,When good business deals go bad,"There once was a man they called HaroldO'er business deals he had a fair holdIf no bargain was struckHe would curse his bad luckAnd write a new book of a rare moldOn the back cover of this novel the reader is informed that Harold Robbins is a phenomenon, then given what I assume is evidence: novels written in 1951, 1961, 1971, 1981, and now... 1991. So, here we have the wonder of a man who has had books published in five consecutive decades in years ending with the number one. My congratulations to the guy, that's quite an accomplishment. As for the rest of it...This one starts with promise. The Amazon adventure was rather exciting, but then we get the typical Robbins business deal porn overkill. They just keep coming and coming, hard and fast. What the heck is it about a business deal that's so fascinating to the guy that there has to be one made every couple of pages? I don't get it. Different strokes for different folks, I suppose."
1,Not a DVI KVM,"I bought this switch to connect two computers with DVI video cards to a DVI Monitor. Nowhere in the description of this product does it say that it is intended to connect two VGA computers to a DVI monitor. The cables are VGA to DVI-A. I tried it anyway connecting it to a VGA card in each computer and then to the switch. Nothing worked on either computer. I then tried my own DVI-D cables with DVI cards. Again, nothing worked on either computer. I have used many KVM switches over the years but this is the first time I've had nothing on either computer work. It was as though I was connecting everything to an empty box. Thanks to Amazon for making my return of this product easy."
3,Nadia's True Identity Reveals (Episode 29-32),"What's most remarkable about the eighth volume of Nadia-Jean adventure somewhat like FUTURE BOY CONAN or THE CASTLE IN THE SKY is Nadia's true identity finally reveals in a mysterious manner in the mysterious island which shows its original self... Red Noah is what is Laputa in CASTLE IN THE SKY and Gigant in FUTURE BOY CONAN, because both Miyazaki works came from the same storyline Miyazaki created with Toho staff the first of which was unfortunately rejected by NHK, national broadcast TV in Japan around 1981 for lack of fund. (Miyazaki at this time was the most destitute and distressed Miyazaki took on NAUSICAA comic in 1982).Verdict: The drama begins to pick up pacesRating: 76 out of 100Recommended for: GAINAX animation fans and Japanese animation fans who like NAUSSICA and NEONGENESIS EVANGELION."
2,Banjo bolt too short,I had another brand stainless steel line on the car but it was getting old so I got these. Nice fit and seemed like a quality product. But the Banjo part was a bit thicker than the other and the washers were also a bit thicker and that combination only left me 3 at most 4 threads to secure the banjo bolt into the caliper. That scared me. I had a good talk with teck support - they assured me that it would work but could not offer a longer bolt or thinner parts so I sent them back.After much searching I found the same brand as I had but with AN connectors not banjo type. 9 threads go into the caliper and I am happy with those. Not sure if Russell also made AN connector type lines or not. If so I could not find them.
2,Funny color and thin,I have seen grey crate pads and this one is more greenish than grey. Also it is thin. I would normally return it but I need it. Hope it holds up.
4,Reading to wake your mind...,"This book is a must have for anyone who likes to read short untraditional stories about anything. Open the book to any page an read any paragraph and you'll be brought into the world and thoughts of Eric Victorino. He writes about what we all think but can't explain, he describes and illustrates concepts in a creative manner that we all could realte to, and just makes you say, ""dam, thats how I feel"". I give this book two thumbs up, its great leisure reading before bed, or at the swimming pool, or even at the bedside of your pregnant wife, you can finish a story in 10 minutes its awesome!"
5,great book,"I love this book. It lets you into the author's life through his short storie and poems. Eric Victorino is a very interesting person who isn't afraid to speak his mind and push the limits. I highly recomend this book, it is raw and captivating."
4,2 year old loves them!,"My daughter started watching Wonder Pets a few months ago, and now I think we have all the dvd's that are currently out. They are cute, short(12 minute) episodes, that hold my daughters attention. They teach good lessons, like sharing and teamwork. Plus they are full of singing and music!!!"
3,The speech makes me wonder.,"My children love this little series. As a parent though, hearing the speech impediment of the duck is like nails on a chalk board. An example is when they sing ""There's an animal on trouble"", hers comes out as ""Daez an animaw in twubo."" Or you don't know if ""feewa"" is feel or fear.If your children are having trouble with pronunciation, I would not recommend re-enforcing it with this series."
5,Great dvd!,My little one loves Wonderpets and this movie was great. So cute. I think the moral lessons of the gang are great for little kids! The bigger kids can just love the cute characters!
4,Tracklisting,"1. Walk Like A Panther (7"" Version) Vocals - Tony Christie2. Snake I (edit)3. Sweaty Walls"
4,What an awesome band with a great future ahead of them!,"I saw the All Seeing Eye play live at a festival in England and to say the least, they rocked. They have such a variety in their music with some great Dance beats to get you moving. I can't wait for the Album to be released."
2,self help revisited,Another self help formula book attempting to offer a catchy step by step (DARE) program to well being. It attempts to depart from the now defunct inner child movement of the past and replace it with an updated version. Pass.
4,Good Product,I've purchased these leggings from Macy's in the past so I knew what I was getting. Compared to other leggings I've used these maintain their shape a little longer and they don't get looser throughout the day. :)
3,Okay,"These fit well (5'7"", 140 lbs) - I especially like that they're long enough for my height. However, they developed a small hole in the crotch after the first time I wore them - and that's the first time I've ever had that happen with leggings. My favorite leggings are the Hue Perfect Fit leggings with the wide waistband - they are of a thicker material and the waistband is so comfortable!"
4,good leggings,"bought hue leggings as well as american apparel leggings. Liked both, good fit and good quality. Hue were of heavier weave, thus warmer and good for winter. Am. app. also good as footless tights under skirt."
4,Perfect Basic Legging,"Hue's cotton leggings are the perfect, basic legging. They don't have any fancy little add-ons, but that's what makes it a great staple. I've purchased about ten in the last two years and I basically live in them since they're comfortable and cute, without making me look too gussied up all the time. The price is a little expensive, but they've lasted far longer then other leggins I've gotten at American Apparel, Old Navy and Target.They do loosen up with time and wear, which makes them less leggings and more flexible skinny pants."
3,Great fabric but run large!,These leggings run large. I typically wear a size 10 and sometimes a 12 so I ordered the large and they were way too big!
4,Great!,"I recently ordered these leggings, which are great. They are made of a thicker material, which is good for cooler temperatures. I have also experienced leggings that were a little see-through when I bent over and such, but these leggings are perfectly solid and don't show anything! I'm 5'1"" with pretty muscular legs and I ordered a medium due to other reviews that I read. The width fits pretty well, but they are so ridiculously long on me!! I wish I had known that these leggings were long. So, these will be perfect for you tall people out there!!"
4,Very nice leggings but they run large.,"The quality of these legging is superior to other brands that are often thinner and prone to pilling. These are thicker leggings but still sheer enough not to feel bulky. Also, this is the only affordable brand that I was able to find that carried a dark brown shade so that's a plus. My main complaint with these is the sizing. I am 5'3 and the x-small was too long to be perfectly comfortable. Of course the material stretches and conforms to the body, but the excess material ends up bunching up in the waist or knee area. But, if you're looking for a particular color and want a sturdier legging, this is a great option."
5,So comfortable and perfect for any season,"I've worn the black Hue XL in Fall and Winter and they are not too hot or cold, just right. They fit like a dream and are not thin or too thick. I have two pairs and want to buy more!"
5,HUE Leggings,"This is a great legging. Heavy weight fabric. I have a large but could wear a med.The crotch is where is should be not mid thigh. No sagging, nice fit at waist so they dont feel like they are falling off. Durable construction, should last me for several seasons.Wish they made more colors."
5,"Comfortable, warm, and opaque","I've been wearing these leggings for years. I usually get them at the department stores, and even when they're on sale it's never this good a price. I stocked up and got 7 pairs in large. I machine wash and dry them, and they hold up surprisingly well. Also, I like that the black color doesn't fade easily, and the leggings are very opaque so I don't have to worry about see-through."
1,Best band with the Worst Videos...,"Massive Attack is one of the best bands ever in my opinion, so it's twice the shame that their videos should feel like rejected concepts tossed at other bands. Rapping at a table. Bad lip-syncing down a boring street. Returning to a gritty apartment. A white guy watching his wife cheat on him with two black men. A baby singing in the womb. A stripper video that is a great example of nudity for nudity's sake. These are some of the worst video concepts ever completed, even early 90's Madonna videos had more taste than this. It's astonishing when the band and their live shows are so clearly intending to bring us something different.I have to say though, that the video for ANGEL should be seen, as it is the one great video they've done."
3,Artistic,Its interesting placing a face to a band. In some ways it can ruin the mystery of who these folks are. These videos arnt that instance. What a wild collection or artistic expressions. My favorite is 'Angel'. I didnt however feel many of the videos matched the songs themselves but that is me seeing the music through my own eyes.
4,fascinating look at relationships,"The best thing about confessions of a dangerous mind was the way in which Barris conducted his relationships. whether it was his dodgy cia links, or his many marriages, all his relationships seemed to be a vehicle to further his career, as opposed to real love felt relationships. While this love was what he craved, every action he did served to ostracize him more.His experience as a host on ""The Gong Show"", ""That's not my Shoe"" and ""Mrs. Pickering's Slappy Happy Show"" showed his appreciation for the absurd and enjoyment to get a laugh out of people. the news that dana gould is playing him in a movie is perfect. what a match."
2,A rather shallow timeline of a golfers 2 years on tour.,"I found the book to be very shallow in its view on the inner workings or life on the tour. It seamed to be more of a quick diary of Paulson's daily play on Tour. There was a lot of ""I shot 74 but if I putted it would have been 70"", but very little was written of other players, caddies, agents, equiptment reps, etc., and how they played into his time on the tour. I guess I was looking for a lot more than what the book delivered."
3,"Some great insights, but monotonous at times","Paulson's book is a wonderful example of life on tour; however, there are too many shot-by-shot (blow-by-blow?) descriptions of individual tournaments. I found interesting Paulson's description of the differences between the mini tours and the big time (notably pressure, casualness of players, social interaction) and I enjoyed his descriptions of his first year on the tour. Unfortunately, after he failed to keep his card after his first year, the story becomes the same, albeit much more knowledge gained for our hero. I guess I was expecting more description about what life held for him out there that first year, not play-by-play. Overall, I enjoyed the book because it is easy reading and thoroughly enjoyable, but (much like Tracy Stewart's book about her late, great husband), simply written. For a much better read on getting on the tour and keeping your card, I recommend Q School Confidential, by David Gould."
4,Living a Virtual Rookie PGA Tour Year,"This is a good golf book. Unassuming, hardworking golfer who until I read this book, I hadn't heard of. Selected this book on a whim, but really enjoyed it. Believe all golfers would, as it shows what it's like to be a golfer of Carl's caliber and how competitive it really is out there. The narrowness at the top, and how illusive it is to stay there."
5,DVD Ghost Whisperer,"Excellent packaging, delivered on time, in great shape. No complaints on the vendor, and highly recommend them. The DVD itself, only complaint is that it does not have subtitle options (for hearing impaired). Otherwise it is exactly as expected."
2,Boring and repetetive,I found the second season rather boring and repetitive. There are no new ideas. My wife and I stopped watching after the third disk.
4,Ghost Whisperer- Season 2,The series grows well between the first and second seasons. The ghosts are generally more powerful and the outcomes of each episode become less obvious with twists they've written in. I think the series is considerably better as it goes along and the characters develop. I can't wait to watch season 3
4,More of what you liked in season one....,If you enjoyed season 1 of Ghost Whisperer then this is really just more of what you love.I have to mention that my fiance and I did notice that Jeniffer Love Hewitt's seeming hatred of clothes that properly contain her chest..so that might be an added perk for some.\/\/
4,Good Plot but Need to hire new wardrobe lady,"I really like the plot. Yes, I believe in spirits and other world. Kind of in philosophy. The plots were good, sometime very spooky. The bad thing for what I feel with this series was the costumes. I think it was ugly. Everytime that I've seen the series, I feel so cross. It like I was watching Melinda got up from the bed with that fluppy dress and hardly contain chest and done her shore with all the ghosts. It's really annoy me. Will she dress properly next season?"
3,ghost whisperer,yes it looks like a good product but unfortunately i am still waiting for arrival of the dvd.
5,I love Friends,"I love friends, i've seen every episode a million times. There are a few questions here and there that i don't know but otherwise this game is great! For a real friends fan."
3,Fans of Friends gotta have!,"After watching all 10 seasons and purchasing the DVDs I had to get the game. A must have for ""Friends"" fans!"
4,Tougher than you might think,"My wife and I are FRIENDS nuts... we have the entire series and watch them all of the time... we thought we knew a lot, but when it started showing scenes with the people missing and the questions were about the real names of obscure guest actors... that's when we realized we're not FRIENDS experts.Still, a very fun game... a bit challenging though..."
4,Scene it Friends Review,"I received this item a little later than I expected. However, it was brand new & it was a good price."
5,Very Pleased,"My Scene It? Deluxe Friends Edition DVD Game was delivered in mint condition. I love it, it's a lot of fun. I definitely got my money's worth."
5,Best Find EVER!,"Scene It games, in general, are always so expensive, especially if it's Friends related. Not only was this a great find on the price, it was a great find in general as my wife and I could not find this game in stores anywhere! We had to have it because we own all 10 seasons and just love the show! Great to have for parties or just to play with a few people."
4,Friends Scene It is SO fun!,We purchased this game as we are huge fans of the Friends television show. We played it for the first time with several friends that also enjoyed the show and had a great time! The tin it comes in is very nice and stores easily. Highly recommend this game if your a Friends fan!
3,Caveat Emptor,"While this is a good performance of this enjoyable opera, buyers should beware. The performance clocks in at less than eighty minutes which means it could have been stuck on a single disc--...Moreover, two numbers (and a few other snippets) from the complete opera are cut ...BTW, the Decca version is superior. The performance is as good...less of the text is cut...and the two discs are well filled with the Merry Widow and selections from Der Graf von Luxembourg.The moral: steer clear of this EMI [bad deal] and go with the Decca..."
3,Caveat Emptor,"Let the buyer beware...This may be a fine performance, but...1. The two discs come out to a timing of less than eighty minutes...In other words, the entire performance could have been put on a single disc. As it is the 20 plus dollar cost of this opera is a patented record company rip-off.2. This is not a performance of the entire opera. Two tunes are missing along with other small cuts."
2,Waste of money,"I am an AC/DC fan of old. However, I found this CD to be a disappointment, to say the least. Who wants to hear someone other than the band while listening to an AC/DC CD? I got it because I love their music, but there was precious little of that in relation to the obnoxious intonations of the anonymous, undesirable voices talking about things almost any self-respecting AC/DC fan would already know. All I can say is, if you're looking for something new and different from Angus and the boys since ""Stiff Upper Lip"", better make do with what you've got than to waste fifteen bucks on this. Enough said."
3,Not for the Beginner,"This book is a bit of a heavy history more geared for academic study then edge of your seat page-turner. As with any book of this size there are always bound to be interesting bits of information, and this book does deliver that. There are a number of details on army group makeup, command structure and tactics as well as a good review of German Army campaign citations and medals. If you are interested in the topic then this is a good book to read, if you are a new comer to this field then this is not the first book to pick up."
4,Addicted to a Simply Irresistible Music Album,"I had forgotten the late Robert Palmer had so many hits. I wasn't very old when most of them came out but when I hear them on this CD I still remember them, they are great songs. I originally got this album for Some Like It Hot and Simply Irresistible and whilst they would still be my favourites I'd have to say there's definitely no fillers on this album. Throughout Robert Palmer's career he made some great songs, and you'll find them on here. Definitely a must have album. Also a pretty extensive cover booklet that gives you a great background and history. No lyric sheet is the only thing that lets this album down."
3,Remixes spoil an otherwise decent collection,"It may not include all of the American hits (eg. Early in the Morning) but the most significant international hits are here and digitally remastered.What is wrong with this compilation are the remixed versions of ""Bad case of loving you"" and ""Looking for clues"". These remixes appeared on an earlier Palmer compilationn and have resurfaced again on this! Why? Apparently Palmer re-recorded these and other early songs a few years back because he wasn't happy with the originals. Unfortunately, the originals are brilliant, and should have been included. Based on reviews for the American equivalent of this compilation, other customers agree with me.The CD also includes two new songs recorded before his untimely death."
4,One Song Short of 5 Stars,"This is a wonderful compilation of Palmer tunes and the remastering sounds great. As unbelievable as it seems, they omitted ""Best of Both Worlds"" and for that sin I can only award the effort 4 stars."
2,Poor Craftmanship,I'm thinking about sending this one back due to an improper fit where the bolster meets the handle. Going to call Shun and post a picture of the perceived defect. This is the 5th Shun knife I purchased recently and I don’t see any similar defects on them.
1,"poor quality, construction and arrived damaged","NOT even close to worth the money!This storage cabinet at the very least was poorly stained. There are unstained bare spots on the front and around the drawer pulls. There is an area on the front that is dented and concaved.Also, it arrived in a box that was damaged...but left outside while I wasn't home so I couldn't refuse or report the damage. I am stuck but will NEVER order anything from Leslie Dame Enterprises again."
2,Unreadable without a magnifying glass,"I ordered this book because I am a fan of the author and I like other books she has written. Unfortunately, the print in so tiny (I mean tiny) that I literally had to get a magnifying glass to read it. After a few pages the eyestrain prevented me from reading any more. Judging by the headers, it looks like it's probably a good book. The only problem is that it's unreadable by anyone over 40, and that includes me. Too bad, because I was really looking forward to reading another book by this author whose work I admire."
5,Great!!!,This is a great item. I think that the items are great. The only down side to this product is that the bridle is too big for traditional horses or any horses.
2,I love Breyer but this set sucked,"I love breyer I had just started colleting breyer and this looked like a great saddle set to help me start when I got home Hi, I tried it on my breyer when I was putting it on the bridle snaped by the ears a few days later the anther part of the bridle snapped and the surups stretched. I also found out that the sturups dangled so far off the horse that my rider can't put her feet in to them. I also found out that the helmet did not fit on my breyer rider's head!If you are thinking about buying breyer tack you are better off buying the hunter/jumper bridle and saddle."
3,This is Just OK.,My daughter is 8 and received this for Christmas. It was expensive but was one of the few things she she wanted. It has been frustating for her and me both. The head piece is not made correctly so fits badly and has just been tossed aside. The other pieces do fit and are durable enought but still expensive for what they are.
3,cool!,"I like this toy. it is a graet saddle set, but from what i read from other reviews, the bridle dosent fit the horses. it is way better then the western one."
2,Historical research needed,"The story might be worth three stars, but the whole book is undermined by the author's lack of familiarity with the process of divorce in Regency-era England. It simply wasn't so casual."
2,"Old, obsolete","A description of this battle hastily scrawled by a special correspondent for a contemporary paper, scrawled by a correspondent with a very limited view of the action, could hardly be more out-of-date. The vision of the American Civil War presented by this book at least isn't partisan: it is, well, centennial! Alot of books came out during, and leading up to the centennial, and most of them aren't any good. Foote, and Catton are enjoyable writers, but history-writing has changed alot since ca.1960. Keegan's ""Face of Battle"" really changed the whole historiographic scene, and that's too bad, in a way. I have some affection for this old stuff (Stackpole, Francis Lord, etc.) but it just don't play anymore."
3,Awkward mix that doesn't jell,"After being disappointed in the recent ""Dido"" with Maria Ewing (see my review of that) I sought refuge in this newer production. The DVD features an interview with the director which offers nothing to clarify his concept of the piece. Little of what he says makes much sense to me. Against the painfully minimalist sets the realistic emoting of the principles strikes a jarring note. A more restrained approach would have worked better to my mind. Even worse are the minimally clad dancers whose weird gyrations seem totally out of character for the rest of the production. Sarah Connelly is a great singer and she does a wonderful job but the supporting cast is not as satisfying as the aformentioned filmed version. There are a few interesting touches in this live performance but it feels too much like three different shows that don't really fit together. If only the current crop of stage directors would stop being so damned clever and just do their job."
2,Ballet fans BEWARE!,"If you are looking for dancing, do not buy this DVD. The dance interludes are few and far between, and VERY BRIEF. Also, the stage sets are minimal and the costumes ugly. As for the drama, Dido is a dowdy frump and Aeneas comes across as a weak, chubby mama's boy. To make matters worse, the main characters and chorus spend an inordinate amount of time sitting and lying about on the floor. If you want a more beautiful and inspiring production of this opera, try the Collegium Musicum version."
2,One song,I thought there would be more songs on this album there is only one song with different versions of the same song.
1,Item falls off of vents.,"They attach to the vents with magnets, which is not an issue because I did not want something permanent but after a day of being on the vents both that I have purchased have fallen. I will be returning these and buying a different brand."
3,Magnets should be stronger,"I like that this is adjustable.As for the magnets, my vent is not on the floor but up near the ceiling. The magnets are weak, and so one side of the deflector slides down over time. We had to put sticky-tack under it to keep it from sliding down. :("
3,Only for Floor Vents,Product is light weight. Product does not stay together well when used near maximum of adjustable length. Bought product to use on an upper wall vent...product would not stay together and magnets were not strong enough for use on the painted wall vent. Swapped this product with a similar but heavier duty deflector previously at work on a floor vent. Purchased product now works adequately on the floor vent.
5,excellent vents,"I ordered two models of Deflecto vents and both are outstanding. Heavy duty plastic, large strong magnets on the side and they work perfectly. Would recommend to anyone, especially since these are impossible to find locally, just try asking for one in your local home depot/lowes, they're never even heard of the product."
3,Expensive for what it is ...,"These air deflectors are made in USA but are pretty flimsy for the price. The molds they were produced in left a lot of flash (the excess plastic that is present where the 2 halves of the mold come together) which means they were probably using old equipment/molds ... it does not affect the functional aspects, it just gives a low quality feel to the product.The magnetic mount works fine. I have some vents that are a bit wider than these are intended for, but it still works.All in all ok - but not ""wow what a great product"". I'd still get these over again."
2,Not made for ceiling vents,We have been looking for a vent reflector or cover for our ceiling vent for 2 yrs. I've tried everything from plastic to magnetic covers. This is not made for ceiling vents
4,Unbreakable air deflector,This is what I expected. It does move the air better over my bed which is what I wanted it to do. It's not great but then it's better than nothing.
3,Deflects air,"I've got corner windows with a standard 2 way register directly above them. I did some researching and I did find one way register via Home Depot, but I would still lose a significant amount of heat from being blown so close to the window and outer wall (that faces the outside). Now it's being blow towards the room and I notice our thermostat is not turning on the heater as frequently.The magnets on this thing are not too strong which was disappointing, but you could go to a hardware store to get a more powerful one to glue onto the unit. Considering the cost of the unit, this is not a great deal, but not a deal breaker.Since my registers aren't painted over, the magnet stuck with sufficient force even with the vent fully opened.I do like that it is clear plastic, but we'll see how long that lasts.I ended up ordering 3 more since the builders mysteriously decided to put vents near my exits and windows."
3,Works well,"I bought these to deflect warm air into the room instead of letting it go behind my thermal draperies. My air vents are the maximum width for these protectors, which slide to accomodate a larger width vent. So, because they're at the maximum width, they are not quite as sturdy as they would be for a vent in the middle or lower end of the product range. Still, they do a decent job. I wish they were a tiny bit taller -- that would encourage my draperies to hang behind them instead of over the top. But they do move the air out into the room, and they do prevent the drapes from billowing out too far. I ordered another one for a different window which also has long draperies."
1,Plastic melted when left on heat register,"This product does not do even the simplest function in its name. I placed the Model 50 ""Unbreakable"" Air Deflector on my wall heat register last night. When I woke up this morning, the plastic had melted (see my picture of it in the Customer Pictures), and the heater had not been running for several hours. If this product cannot even stand normal heating, it is completely useless to me. Fortunately Amazon will refund it and pay for return shipping, so 5 stars for their customer service on this incident. I would highly recommend against purchasing this item and attempting to use it on a heat register."
1,Magnets are not strong at all,We bought this for a ceiling vent to blow the AC out of our closet and into the bedroom. It took almost an hour to get the thing to stick to the vent. The magnets are not strong. It falls frequently when the AC comes on. It's particularly annoying when it crashes down onto the hardwood floors while we are sleeping. I would not recommend this item for a ceiling vent.
5,They work...,"What can I say, they work. Push the magnets up as you ""attach"" them to ceiling vents.These can also be used, quite efficiently, as a magnetic refrigerator shelf or kitchen sink shelf/colander."
5,Helps regulate room temperature,"Purchased this deflector since one of our vents is pointing at the thermostat in our house and the thermostat gets warmer (or cooler) faster than the rest of the room causing my wife to increase the temperature in the winter (and me to decrease the t-stat temp in the summer) on the t-stat to get the room comfortable. Now the air is deflected away from the t-stat allowing the room to heat more evenly. I haven't tested it in the summer but it should be fine. Item has two strong magnets that easily hold the item on the ceiling vent. It's adjustable enough for a perfect fit for our standard sized vent. Exactly what we needed and I could not find one locally. For the price, this was perfect."
4,"Not bad, not great","It works. Nothing special about the product. The quality isn't great or bad. I have it hanging from a ceiling vent and the magnet holds it up fine. It was a bit smaller than I expected, but it still works fine for directing the air away from my face at night. I would probably buy it again given the option although it is slightly overpriced."
2,Not new,"Shipping was the fastest I've ever had for any Amazon product. Ordered Tuesday, got it on Thursday (two days). That's with the cheapest shipping option. Does the job. Seems sturdy. However, it does have over 10 scratches and some oily finger marks on it. I had to look back at the description of the product to see if I accidently bought a used product. Nope, I bought ""new"". Could have at least hit it with Windex before shipping. You can only see the scratch marks if you get close to it.Will not even waste time sending it back as it's under $10 and it's in an area that will not be seen. Disinfected my hands after I installed it.Pros:-Fastest shipping ever-Seems very sturdy-Does the jobCons:-Used-Scratches-Oily finger marks"
1,Do not use for a wall furnace,"Do not use this on your wall furnace.For one, the magnets will not hold it in place.And the plastic will melt from the heat, warping its shape, and causing the two halves to separate."
3,It's OK.,"It does the job, although I wish the magnets were just a bit stronger. It barely stays in place."
4,Suitable for ground registers,"We purchased two of these units to deflect air inward on ground registers near large windows. They are working admirably for this purpose. The magnets are strong enough to hold them tightly and would likely be sufficient to do so when drawing light curtains over them. Heavy drapes might prove to be a different story. I would not call these unbreakable by any means as a foot would surely crack them. However, absent such weight, there is no reason that they will not last. Be warned, however, if you need them in a high-traffic area. Finally, we have seen no evidence of melting, as others have experienced. I would imagine that if you don't have them near your furnace, that they will do fine in the long term in this regard."
3,So so.,"I bought this to help redirect the air in my daughter's room so the vent wasn't blowing directly on her face. It works, but it's kind of cheaply made.I like it and for the price it's great."
2,Model 50 Air Deflector,Opening or closing curtains will brush the air deflector enough tomove it and cause it to be non-functional or partially block register air flow.It needs STRONGER MAGNETS!
2,narrow and flimsy,"do the magnets keep the deflector secured to the vent? yes. unfortunately, this deflector is barely large enough to cover HALF of the vent. it is virtually useless. the only reason I'm not returning it is because it was so cheap that it's not worth the hassle of packing it up and paying for return shipping."
4,Decent Product,These little adapters are expensive for what they are but the do what is expected. The magnets are strong enough to prevent movement on a floor vent. I do not have ceiling vents to test them on. The plastic is sufficiently stiff but would not withstand and accidental foot step.
5,Very usable,"This deflects air from your vent cover. it has magnets. it's easy to adjust the width. it doesn't flop up with your unit turns on due to strong enough magnets on either side. I actually sat this one on the floor one time and still stayed down. I wouldn't buy it online though, mine was probably $5. Highly recommended and extremely usable."
1,"Great Musician and Artist, But A Singer He Ain't","Let me preface this by saying that ""Touch"" is one of my all-time favorite CD's EVER! I bought this CD several years ago. I played it exactly twice. It became a frisbee. The vocals (singing?) were pathetic. It's a stretch of the imagination to say that it resembles a marketable recording. If you buy it, put your earmuffs on, 'cause you ain't gonna like it."
2,Anime fan-but this series disappointment,"I loved the G force episodes and would love to see the Gatchaman series (without subtitles) but I know why now I did not watch BOTP as a child, cause of goofy 7 Zark 7, 1 rover 1...that by no means disrespect to Casey Kasem as Eagle 1 and Alan Young from Mr. ED (Wilbur) but sound quality and animation quality could definately get an upgrade. I collected the first few volumes but I would rather get Dubbed titles of G force or Gatchaman."
1,Missing 8 minutes,"Did I enjoy this movie? Yes.Did I enjoy it more when I saw the deleted 8 minutes? Yes. For example, PBS cut out a scene where the father tries to explain to the son why he is leaving.PBS cuts down programs to fit the current 90 minute slot for Masterpiece. I understand this, and I accept it. When PBS negotiates the rights to release the program on DVD, the DVD only includes the footage that was shown on Masterpiece (rather than the whole program). I don't understand this. PBS does this a lot. They cut 40 minutes from Any Human Heart. This practice stinks, and people should know that they are not getting the entire program despite purchasing the DVD at full price.I give this DVD only one star because of the missing footage."
2,Disney meets Masterpiece Theatre,"Oh, how sad.This film is so 'blurg' that I actually stopped watching in the middle (a rare thing for me). I am a true Masterpiece Theatre fan even after they splintered things up into their three little nifty categories, ""Classic"", ""Mystery"" and ""Contemporary"". However if things go the way of ""Framed"" I will no longer be watching.This was so incredibly trite - montage-methods going back to bad TV movies and holiday Hallmark specials, plot leaps, adults becoming enamored and soften by the oh-so bright children, country school marm who knows so much more about art than the curator of an international museum, silly background music to tell you that something is supposed to be ""cute"" or funny....oh - should I go on.....?Probably not.If you like Disney family movies, you'll love it. If you like Masterpiece Theatre, you'll hate it.""Will the real Masterpiece Theatre please stand up!?"""
1,Horrid treacle.,"Just horrid treacle. Predictable, cliche and more than a bit insulting. Aren't those barely employed local yokels cute as they try to understand Fine Art? Hork."
1,You're Kidding... Right?,"This MUST be the most insipid garbage I have ever allowed myself to listen to. Pathetic vocals, boring and predictable rythym, and completely uninspired music.This is garbage-pop at it's WORST.If you have half a brain in your head (and want to use it), try the following artists: Hednoize Underworld Psykosonik Love & Rockets Massive AttackThese are bands who actually put THOUGHT into their music..."
3,This is not dance music!,This is pure and simple pop music in the vain of Aqua or Ace of Base. I am astonished to find it classed amongst Amazon's best dance CDs of 1999. As pop music it is a good example of the genre but that does not make it dance music in the way I understand it.
2,Generic...borders on the verge of annoying,"I think that this rule pretty much sums up the problem with this cd: what is good in one country isn't necessarily good in another. It's not just that the songs are lacking in intelligence, they are also lacking in originality and inspiration. I can see this being a good workout cd or good for a middle school dance, but unless you are in either of those situations...stay clear!"
5,I like the new sound...:),"I think this is great dance music for an active person like me! I can just go crazy with it! The only thing is if you listen to it for to long, it can get annoying, but otherwise, I'm in love! Two thumbs up! :)"
2,"It's Like Tom Jones, But Not Really","If you enjoy paying money for mindless drivel you can dance to, then look no further than this Vengaboys album. If you ever want to turn your house, apartment, trailer, or dorm room into a Euro-trash dance party, then make sure you bring these four into your stereo. Mindless, but danceable."
4,THIS IS A GREAT DANCE CD!,"I love this cd because of its great dance songs. I am a dancer and these are really upbeat tunes that are great for routines. If you listen too much, however, it can get a little bit annoying"
4,Catchy and great to dance to!,The Vengaboys are a great group.Thier music is memerizing and a real foot taper.
3,"Well, at least it's a fun album!","I do have to admit this is one of the catchiest little gems I have heard recently. The songs are all pretty fun and I just HAVE to dance every time I hear their stuff. But, my God, they have to be the most inane lyrics I have ever heard. Hopefully, they can put a little more thought into their words next time around. Try listening to some Rage Against the Machine for more thought-provoking lyrics but still energetic and passionate music. Although, I wouldn't say the Vengaboys sound passionate. Fun, but not passionate. --Kelly Magovern"
4,Good album,"This is the first time I heard the Vengaboys and loved their party dance music. I liked the way they updated the classic ""Brazil"". ""Going to Ibiza"" and ""Boom Boom Boom"" is a must for every party."
2,boom boom boom bum,you will like this Cd if you have no musical taste or you are death all the tracks are the same and they sound like demo tunes from a childrens keaboard. If you want my advice DON'T BUY IT .
5,24 hours having rhythm,"Vengaboys remind me of Palma de Mallorca, where I spent a great time with some friends! All the songs of this album are great and to hear them is to think about marvellous days and to be full of energy and party all day and night long! It's with no doubt a magnificent album!"
1,Not a good album,"Why would anyone ever buy this album? All the songs sound like they were made in a studio in the back room of a Dollar store, and by that I mean, they sound like they were not worked on very long and hard, Give it up, and Learn how to sing."
1,GOD someone kill me!,"Worst piece of garbage ever. I wouldn't be caught dead with this CD. Infact i'm in denial about living on a planet with people who listen to this junk. Who buys this crap? Why is there demand for this crud? Why have they wasted Earths resources printing this stuff. GOD someone shoot me....i'm of to the mall for some KFC, then perhaps i'll take some eckies and go nightclubbing....bad plebs!!!! shame shame shame!"
1,Why? oh why?,"Who cares if they are going to Ibiza, go there and stay there. This album has nothing new, only under 7's will like the lack of musical talent shown here. I would much rather sit back at home listening to my Cliff Richard The Lords Prayer single, ITS FANTASTIC!"
4,We Like to Party!,This is a fun cd for kids I bet. This is the Six Flags commercial song where the old man dances. My 2yearold nephew & I love to dance to it!
2,Its ok but save your money and go for the singles,I thought this was an ok cd but I am disapointed in 75% of the tracks. They got repetative and boring. I should have just gotten the singles for the two I liked.
1,Vengabores,"How can anyone like this rubbish, would ye ever get out of ye're cots and listen to something decent like The Groove Fiends or The Lashers. This album is borin, repeditive and totally unorginal, boy. D'money for this CD would be better spent on a night out in Henry's were you can hear hooj choons all night."
1,is there anything lower than 1 star??,I'll make this short..i got this album as a gift and listened to it. I hated every single song cuz it has the most annoying beat. I know peoples taste vary but how can anyone listen to repeatitive lyrics that are boring and emotionless???!
2,o.k if you like hardly any lyrics in a song,Bought it for the songs in the charts. From tracks 7 things get a bit dull. It's all dance music with no quality and i never listen to it.
4,This is amazing!,"When I first heard the Vengaboys on the radio, I thought their songs were great. About three songs aren't the best, but if I got the Single CD, I'd really be missing something."
5,"BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!","BUY this CD if you like ""We Like To Party."" The best songs on here are: ""Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom"", ""Up and Down"", ""We Like to Party"", and ""We're Going To Ibiza."" The others are very good as well. Vengaboys come from the Benelux..and they've got it going on!"
1,THIS IS A NIGHTMARE!!!,"This CD reinforces the commom notion that dance music is thrashy. Good thing there's Fatboy Slim, Chemical Brothers, Jamiroquai and even Cake. I'd like to flush this CD down the toilet and send the Vengaboys to the farthermost black hole in the universe never to return"
5,Got a good system in your car?,"Great dance music. It'll bump in your car too...if you got a good stereo system. It's a little repetative between some tracks, but mix it up with other music like it and ""Booyeah""! Overall it gets five stars, I'm looking forward to a second album..."
3,"Up-beat, poppy, catchy!","Light weight artists to be sure, but well worth the investment to add this little dance jewel to your techno/house collection. It will no doubt get the people moving on most dance floors."
2,I did not like it..,"Stand out was ""Boom Boom Boom,"" which is a cute, upbeat dance tune. There was really nothing else I liked. I ended up selling this one."
1,Not worth it,I love Project Runway so much and to be honest this is just a rip off. I did not enjoy this that much at all. I think it should be $10 not the $20.
1,Flying Tigers/ Sand of Iwo Jima,The tape only had Flying Tigers and did not include Sands of Iwo Jima.Returned and had to reorder from another source which was received in good shape.
3,Not made in the U.S.A.,"I am sure this product will work as advertised, but, I paid a premium price for this item based on the fact that the product image indicates it is made in the the U.S.A. Fact is, when the product arrived it turns out it is made in China just like other similar items at half the cost."
5,Galatians,I found this book to be in excellent shape. It enhanced my study of this book of the Bible. I would recommend this book to others.
2,interesting,"It is true...this is the ""best movie about BINGO...EVER!"" Because it is the only movie about bingo.A mockumentary following the lives of bingo addicts, Bingo Gossip is comical but not exactly funny. A few of the characters were entertaining, and there are a couple scenes that are good. The nuns are great.I am happy to own this movie though because I am confident nobody else has seen it that I know- and this is good when company comes over. It is also good because there is no overall message and it teaches you nothing- which is nice sometimes. Therefore, I give it two stars!"
5,Hysterical Mockumentary,"This movie portrayed an in-depth look into the bingo world. It was so funny, and being a mockumentary made it even funnier than if it was just a regular movie. All of the characters were very funny, and I was intrigued to follow them and see what was going to happen. Their zany antics were a hoot! I especially liked the character of Estelle Smith, played by Sheri Goldner. This character was the funniest one in the movie and I thoroughly enjoyed her different aliases. I'm surprised the actress hasn't been in more films. I can't wait to see her in another comedy. I see big things in store for her!"
5,A Great Time,"This movie was just hilarious all around. Outrageous characters, outrageous dialogue, the works. You'll love this movie if you're a fan of the Christopher Guest mockumentaries (Best In Show, A Mighty Wind, etc.). Especially loved the character of Estelle. Haven't seen this actress before, but couldn't get enough of her! She's a riot! I highly recommend this to anyone who likes a good laugh."
5,Great Quality Oven Mitt!!,"I do a lot of cooking in a large cast-iron skillet, where I brown meat on the stove top, then put the skillet in the oven. With cast-iron skillets, the handles get extremely hot and this glove is absolutely the best mitt I ever had in transporting hot cooking skillets and trays, to and from my oven.I have my Reizen glove for over a year and it is standing up very well. Other mitts I have had in the past have become burned, frayed and discolored real quickly. Not this one.I highly recommend the Reizen mit for any kitchen."
5,Good sized mitts,"Great size for oven mitts. They travel far enough up the arm for safely removing large pans from the oven, and we never feel the heat. The price was quite good too."
4,Works fine for most things. Remember to order two.,"First off, these gloves were a fine fit for a guy with slightly above average sized hands (i wear the large sized yellow latex gloves at a snug fit). Unfortunately these don't go all the way to my elbows but I've never before burned myself there anyways. Plenty of forearm coverage.Now temperature wise these things do fine handling stove-top cast iron so i would assume its fine for the grill as well. It also works well for baked goods around 350 deg F but if you bake bread often at 450+, you will need to work fast.And finally, the product looks decent aesthetically except the white threaded design looks somewhat cheaply done with its uneven weave (if you look carefully at the enlarged product picture, you'll get the idea)."
4,Nice and thick,"No more burning my hands! I just threw out my old mitts after getting this one. So far so good. And I like how the length of the oven mit goes up to my elbow, makes me feel I am getting extra protection."
1,They quit working!!!! OUCH!!,I bought these in December and loved them at first. They go to my elbow almost. Now it is August and I was just canning some grape juice and they didn't keep the heat out anymore! Painful lesson here! They have NEVER BEEN WASHED so it wasn't that and they weren't wet. Don't buy these unless you want to replace them every 8 months.
3,Good for the money,I purchased a pair to replace my old Pampered Chef mitt. The fit is good but it does not compare to the pampered chef mitt. I tested the mitt's by removing some bake ware out of my oven and I could feel the heat through the mitt. I switched to the pampered chef mitt and I felt no heat. You get what you pay for.
4,Oven Mitt,There is nothing wrong with the oven mitt in reference to the job it supposed to do. I just have lager arms so I can not pull the oven mitt all the way on. They fine for my granddaughter.
4,Nice for the price,"Good mitt. Protects well from heat, and the length will guard your whole forearm. Still looking for a good quality mitt that is waterproof and stain proof and cheap, but for the price, I can't complain about this product."
3,Where's *N'SYNC??!!,"I loved the movie, especially when they played *N'SYNC's song. I dancing in my seat and singing along with them. I got some weird looks from people, but hey it's all good. It's a great song. I was going to buy the soundtrack until I found out that they weren't on it, but I'm not now. But I gave it 3 stars because it has Willie and Chad Brock (Country's my first love of music). They are both great artists."
2,It's ok....,"I thought that this soundtrack was kinda messed because the producers of the movie use 'N SYNC's ""Space Cowboy"" to promote the movie and it is in the movie, but it isn't on the soundtrack!! How messed up is that?!?!"
1,Cant believe it!,"I cannot believe that ""Fly Me To The Moon"" is not included in this soundtrack!!! What are they thinking??? That was the most memorable song in the movie!!!!! Not buying it now!"
4,This is good stuff!,"A nice album...with Willie doing some beautiful traditional songs. I've enjoyed the jazz as well. Mandy Barnett does a truly outstanding job on ""I Only Have Eyes For You."" It's worth buying this CD just to hear her sing this song. Give it a listen."
1,"No ""Fly Me to the Moon""????","So where the hell is Frank Sinatra's ""Fly Me to the Moon""?!! It's the best damn song in the movie and the ONLY reason I would buy the CD!! Come on production company!!!!"
3,Help,Can anyone tell me the name of the country song that is playing in the background of this movie while they are at the bar. Its Right before clint eastwood and 'tiny' almost get into a fight. Its when 'tank' is playin that crane game. Thanks to anyone who can help.
3,missing track?,I saw Space Cowboys and went out to buy the CD but the title song was not included on the cd. Why not? i was an awesome song.
4,One of the best in small speakers,"Recently bought mix of 110x and 120x.These are one of the best in range. I had floor standing speakers before and wanted to get small speakers now. These one give very clean and true sound. Neither too much instrumental nor too much vocal music. The sound is very realistic.These speakers are not xyz speakers but are of the line of Bose and other high end speakers. These speakers have strong mid-range , pretty good high but almost no low. You will need a sub with cutoff freq of 150hz or more to acompany these speakers.These speakers are good for small rooms only, their sound may seem feable for larger rooms.The reason I have given 4 stars is I couldn't get full speactrum of sound from these,which is only possible with big floor standing speakers"
1,did not work,"I ordered this pen for Christmas, only to find out on Christmas morning that the pen did not work. Too expensive to return."
1,ugliest thing,guys never ever buy this. this is a scam. even my 5 year old can make a better pen.so please dooooooooooooont
3,Not convincing/cheaply made,"The pen is not convincing as a pen so only a dummy would use it, and the battery dies fast. Its good for a few laughs, but not really worth the money."
3,Great Laugh but Short Lived,I was under the impression it would last until the battery died but it only lasts 5-6 shocks
5,attention clubkids everywhere,"Ok, so we all know that Garbage is a great alternative/rock band. That is a given. What most people don't know, is that Garbage is also quickly becoming a clubland staple. With their club mixes of songs such as ""Milk"" (Rabbit In The Moon remixing that smash) and ""Stupid Girl"" (Todd Terry tweaking that one) opening clublands eyes to this group, ""When I Grow Up (mixed by Danny Tenaglia) is the song that is really going to help push these guys to the forefront. A great set of lyrics, that anyone can relate to (Hey, we've all wanted to grow up, but stay young at the same time), and a thumping bassline to keep you moving. Hmmm, a dance song with intelligent lyrics, what a great idea! If you enjoy ""smart"" club music pick this one up."
5,We Rocks,"A predecessor to 1984 (the most awesome book in existence), it also deals with a vision of a dystopia far in the future. Zamyatin depicts a controllist state governed by something as impermeable as mathematics. No emotion is involved and the soul is seen as a disease. Although the situation is much more dispairing than the one shown in 1984, it also offers some hope as one still gets the impression of a resistance outside the green wall. Despite the ""numbers"" being completely brainwashed, the One State is a society on the brink of collapse. The Guardians are ultra paranoid of any abnormal activity, spying on the citizens more than normal. The book is written in the form of a journal addressed to the people of another planet. It justifies the One State and is an attempt to socialize the other planet's people before a possible invasion by men."
4,A Must Read,"For my English class we had to read a book for a book report, and I chose the book Baby-Sitting Is a Dangerous Job. My favorite part was when Darcy found out that she was going to baby-sit the Foster Family's children, and they had vicious dogs. I also liked when Darcy saw mysterious things happening around their house . I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery books."
5,"Danger, fear, and bravery","This story takes place in Atheneum , New York in 1985 were Darcy is trying to baby-sit 3 sibblings and at the same time escape a group of angry men who have kidnapped them.This book is mostly about a young 13 year old girl who gets a Babysitting job and its her responsibility to take care of 3 youngsters.But at the same time she's trying to escape a group of 3 angry men. What will happen to them ?Will they be rescued or will they have to suffer?In my opinion this is an EXCELLENT book because its full of mystery. You'll get so attached to it. I would recommend this book because its full of mischief."
3,Cristian,This book is not recomended for readers who like action books because this book hardly even has action. This book is just about a baby sitter who has problems baby sitting and is the worst thing she likes to do. When she was little she was baby sited and a robber had killed her baby sitter and she was scared sense then. I don't recomend this story to story lovers.
4,Jason's Review,I liked this book because it was exciting and you never really know what is going top happen next.This book was about a baby-sitter who while baby-sitting the brattiest kids ever. An alarm goes off and she thinks it was one of the kids just playing around but then she finds out that some one actually did break in and that they are planning to kid nap the kids for ransom. They were going to let the baby-sitter go but then she let it slip that she knew who the leader of the group was. Now they are locked in side of a house and Darcy (the baby-sitter) has to do what ever is possible to get her self and the kids out of there. And with a little help from the kids maybe she can get them out.I would recommend this book to someone who liked books of suspense and thriller.Willo Davis Roberts is my favorite Suspense/Thriller writer and i have read a couple of her other books I would recommend that you read also Twisted Summer and Scared Stiff.
5,good book.,I read this when I was a kid and it's still awesome. For some reason I remember it being longer....lol. great book though. love the hideout in the attic
5,Excellent Book,"I really enjoyed the case studies in this book. They illustrated the emotional issues that often come up when a loved one needs care that can't be provided at home. There are other books that deal better with the financial issues and Medicaid. This one focuses on how, in some circumstances, the most loving choice is a nursing home. It also is very informative on how to research a home and how important it is to do this BEFORE a loved one needs it, since many people, about 50%, are admitted with 24 - 48hrs notice after a hospital stay."
1,Don't waste your money,This is only a good book of stories if you are planning on moving your parents into a nursing home. That's it.
5,A must read for families with aging parents (no later than 70),"6+ stars****** My parents recently moved into an assisted living facility. I wish I had read this book before instead of just after so I could have acted sooner. It gave me strength as my mother cried to know that this too shall pass and it is truly the wisest, safest, and healthest action to take. Each day is a little better. If I had read the book earlier I would have not made excuses for the mounting behavior changes, seen through her intelligent masking of memory loss, and helped my Dad make the difficult decision earlier, probably making the move easier for both of them. Stella's gift to us of her experience through the stories makes it an easy and pleasent read. As every pregant woman reads ""What To Do When You're Expecting"" so should every adult with 70+ parents read ""The Eldercare Handbook"". At least then you'll know it's normal and can make loving, practical decisions."
2,Cheap. Really Cheap.,"This thing is made of cheap, brittle plastic that is just waiting to break the first time you bump it with anything hard. In fact, mine arrived already chipped. Not worth the shipping cost to exchange. Magnets are adequate but they are housed in a metal sheath that will scratch the paint on your vents. Extend it beyond halfway and it sags in the middle and tries to come apart. After much wrestling I finally got it to stay in place on my 12"" wall and it functions adequately, but you get just what your pay for with this. If you are concerned at all with durability, look elsewhere."
3,Flimsy,"The Model 51 will do the job I bought it for, but I would advise others to try a different brand. The connecting track does not hold the two pieces together well. I duct taped them in place as I need to duct tape the deflector to my air conditioner anyway, so for me it's not a big deal, but I've purchased sturdier deflectors in the past. Keep looking!"
1,didn't work,arrived but didn't work....disappointed with the quality....had to return....didn't have a problem with the return....i would not recommend this product.
3,Works well but can melt.,"We didn't want to move our bed, so I purchased two of these deflectors. The one in the living room behind the TV stand works great, but the one we put behind our bed is melted. Scary. Although I do think this might be due to the fact that we don't have a headboard and it gets extremely warm back there, I was a little disappointed, but again think this product works well for most needs."
5,Register deflectorby Mr. Finicky,"On an old fashion wall register deflect heat downward , A/C upward. Adjust unit with 2 hands for correct width. You may have to push magnets toward register to get a solid grip.Cleans easily with mild soap and water, dry completely.Affordable and successful."
5,Works fine for me!,"I am a Krav Maga student and Instructor and kicking the groin is our specialty. ;-) So, even for women, it is good to wear one of those for sparring or doing techniques. Anyway, I like this one so much better than the Adidas female groin protector. The Adidas one kept chaffing between my thighs and hurt like heck and I do not have big thighs! The Amber protector felt much better on my body and didn't chafe at all.. Also, the lower abdomen protection part wasn't so high up that I couldn't bend over. It slips on and off very easily. It protected me very well.The only negative was that it is bulky in the front so sometimes my pants didn't cover over it as much as I wanted it to but it really depends on the type of pants you're wearing. I usually wear lower hip pants so that was probably why.Female groin protectors are pretty rare so this one was a good one."
1,Worthless,"These went from the package to the trash. I tried them on several vents in the house (yes, all metal) and they don't even try to stick. They are made for floor vents which wasn't clear in the description, but if there is any kind of air pressure these would simply rise away from the vent."
4,Make sure your vent is magnetic to begin with!,"The other review I read said it either works wonderfully or it sucks. For me, it didn't really work but my vent wasn't magnetic to begin with; definitely should have checked that before ordering. Anyway, its still light-weight and you can trim it down to size."
1,returned item didn't get prompt return service or full refund???,"I purchased this item and the size was incorrect. I called about a return and did so. Unfortunately I had to follow up almost 2 weeks after the return was received to ask about my ""refund"". I was told I would get an email from Amazon. Funny thing the day I called I got the notice of refund from Amazon. Refund wasn't for the correct amount!!! Left a call for the balance due but have not received a call back. Poor customer relations for $.88. I don't know much about the product but I do know about the seller. Won't do business with them ever again. I have never had a problem with an Amazon product before."
2,Good enough NON-MAGNETIC vent covers,"I read a few reviews, so I knew not to expect much, and I wasn't disappointed. They aren't much. But, as another reviewer pointed out, if you get a couple strong magnets you can hold them in place on a wall or ceiling. They're quite literally JUST BARELY magnetic, thin, and flimsy as all get out, but if you don't mind that they're good enough to do the job with a little magnetic reinforcements."
1,Just doesn't work,"Don't know what else to say. I tried it on floor, ceiling, and wall vents and the magnets are so weak they even float off the floor units. Don't wast your time."
2,TERRIBLE,"Just like everyone else experienced, these are not magnetic at all. Better off using anything else to cover your vent!"
2,Weak magnet,These were not designed to cover vents. Not enough magnetism in these sheets to stay in place. Better for taking notes on the fridge door.
5,Great Item,For an old mobile home with vents on the floor these items have helped keep my house cooler in the summer and so much warmer in the winter
1,can any product really be this bad?,so flimsy they don't even stay or block air on floor vents. the vent just blows around them so I end up putting books on top of them to hold them down.
1,Won't even stay put on FLOOR VENTS!,We ordered these two cover two vents placed on the floor in the same corner of our living room right where the Christmas tree goes. My boyfriend shut off that zone directly from the furnace as well. Air still seeps out and these don't stick to anything at all. Waste of money.
1,Did not work,We tried to use this product on ceiling vents and they did not have enough magnetic strength to stay in place.
1,Very weak magnets,"I installed these on some ceiling vents today. The magnetic material is so weak it will barely hold up it's own weight. I kind of expected them to stick pretty well, but not the case. I have a single blower fan supplying all the vents in my house. I was attempting to block 6 metal vents which have only the standard factory paint. What I found was 3 of 6 fell off by morning.The good news is I returned them to Amazon and got a full refund. And because I ordered via Amazon Prime they even paid the return shipping. Gotta love Amazon Prime."
2,Not very effective.,"Our vents are on our ceiling in the basement. As soon as the heat comes on, they fall off! My husband ended up taping them on to make them stay."
1,no magnetic force - won't stick when system fan blows,Product does not work with forced air fan systems. The magnetic force in these magnets will not hold them to the metal vent/register during fan operation making them worthless for anything besides crafts with kids and they're weak there too.
1,"MVCX512 Magnetic Vent Covers (5"" X 12"", 3-pk)","This product does not have strong enough magnetic force to hold the weight of the vent cover against gravity. I have sheet steel A/C vents. The covers barely hold on to the wall vents and don't hold at all to the ceiling vents. When the A/C fan came on, the wall cover fell to the floor. I compared the magnetic strength of the vent covers with photo magnets from Shutterfly by applying the vent cover to the refrigerator. They both held with the same apparent strength. I tried to attach the photo magnets to the wall vent. It held, but not as strongly as to the refrigerator. The problem seems to be the amount of ferrous material in the vent cover and the shape of the cover - mine were stamped by machine and the built-in air deflectors in the vent are raised slightly from the edges of the vent where they attach to the wall/ceiling. There isn't enough flat surface for the magnetic covers to grip.MVCX512 Magnetic Vent Covers (5"" X 12"", 3-pk)"
1,Solution for the Weak Magnetic Vent Covers,"I read the reviews. Knew I was taking a chance on these things. But they're pretty cheap so took the plunge, knowing I had a back-up plan. Sure enough, these covers won't stay up on a ceiling vent, even with no air flow. So I resorted to back up, which is button magnets on top of the covers. Don't laugh. These are not your mother's refrigerator button magnets. They look unobtrusive but are NOT for sissies. I got some neodymium button magnets (Part No. ZD3) from K&J Magnetics on line ([...]). Pack of 10 for 5 bucks. They are the strongest magnets in the world and it's even hard to pull one from a stack of them. I use six per cover because I like three on the long side but 4 total would likely do. They look fine and make the vent covers do the job which at they fail so miserably on their own."
2,"The right size and shape, but magnet far too weak to actually block the air.","The MVCX512 Magnetic Vent Covers are a bit of a joke. The magnetic force is so weak that not only will they not stay put when the air is blowing, they tend to curl and fall off even when put on any old flat piece of metal. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is that they are the right size and shape and sturdy enough to act as a vent cover when taped in place with duct tape."
3,Magnetic vent covers,"These magnetic vent covers do the job, but they need more magnet to them, they don't stay in place.Other than that they are just fine."
3,Wrong color displayed,The product works well but in the picture it appears to be black/dark brown. When I received it they were white. The company claims they do not come in the darker color. The white did not work for me. They refunded me 100% of the money.
4,Happy with these for low traffic areas,"I debated purchasing these when reading the other reviews. I went ahead and purchased one pack of 3 to try them out, then ended up ordering more. For floor vents that won't often be kicked or disturbed, they do the job just fine. I use our bonus room as a home gym, and like to keep it cooler than the rest of the house. I closed the three floor vents and covered each with a magnetic vent cover- and it's quite cool in there (nice for when you get your sweat on!) I used these in other rooms that we don't often use in the winter, so I wasn't heating our guest room when we didn't have guests, for example.The magnetic capability is NOT very strong, so I would only recommend these for vents where they lay flat on the floor. I wouldn't expect them to stick too well to ceiling vents or vertical walls. However, for my needs (and floor vents) I definitely notice a difference, and am happy with them."
1,Do not buy !!!,You may as well stick duck tape over the vent these do not work! I read the other bad reviews and figured i would give it a try. I figured there is at least one good review on the vent cover . So i would give it a try...lol They fell right off! THEY DONT EVEN STICK TO ANOTHER MAGNET THAT I HAVE..LOL
1,Not too great,"This product is simply a magnetic strip which seemed like an excellent but the problem is it doesn't stay. We have a metal vent on the wall above my sons crib and I needed something to block the cold air. It fell several times, I ended up having to use an adhesive to get it to stay on the vent"
5,A must have toy for your little one!,"The Discovery Ball by LeapFrog is an excellent learning toy for your child. The sound, lights, and movement keep the attention of the most active child. Not only does it teach your child the alphabet, but the sounds of the letters. In addition the movement helps the child with coordination, as they reach to spin the ball."
1,Dealer not responsive!,"I bought this for a Christmas present. It did not work. I wrote an unacceptable review and heard from the seller immediately that she would replace the item and I should have given her the opportunity to make it right before commenting, and please remove the unfavorable comments. I immediately ups'd the ball to her, and removed my unsatisfactory comments, assuming she would make the situation right. Six weeks later I have still not received a replacement. I wrote to her last week, and still no acknowledgements or ball. Unfortunately, I did remove the original comments in good faith. My mistake! Still waiting....."
4,Good toy for tots!,"My 10 month old loves this. It's not the best ABC toy out there, but it's different and that keeps her interest. I prefer the Alphabet Pal, but this is a good toy too."
4,Great toy!,"My daughter is 5 months old and can play with this ball already. We put it on the ground with her during tummy time and she will scoot over to it, reach out and spin it. At first we thought it was a fluke - but she did it over and over. I think she likes the lights on it. I didn't read the book that came with the toy (i'm not even sure if it comes with a book) but it did take me forever to figure out that pressing each letter on the ball plays a different tune or says the letter's name. I love that feature!I'm sure the fact that it comes apart will be great later on - but for now it's perfect in the stand."
3,Fun but tricky for babies,"This ball is very nice. It plays music and sings the alphabet. The songs and alphabet sounds are coordinated with the letters. This is great but no baby under 2 is going to make this connection. I play with it more than the baby does. Also, after about 3 months of trying to get my 9-12 month old to play with this ball I gave up because he would spin it a couple of times and then throw it to the side and go for the cardboard box. The sound is good at first but quickly deteriorates. New batteries might help."
3,"GOOD TOY, BAD NOISE","The toy itself is great. I love the way that when you roll it, it sings the abcs and does songs. We bought it for my son when he was born and he just now started playing with it at 11 months but it doesnt work that great. He has to roll it a certain way to get it t do anything and he gets bored with it and crawls away. I love the volume buttons on the ball and it doesnt get annoying."
3,it's ok,"We bought this for my daughter at 6 months and she still loves it now at 10 months. The only problem is that it no longer plays a song when she spins it - it actually stopped doing this after the first week. We changed the batteries and it still does not work. In order to keep her interest with the ball, every time she spins it we press a button for it to play music and light up."
4,"Great toy, very educational","I bought this as a christmas present for my son when he was 4 months old. He loved to look at the lights and listen to the music. As he got older, he would spin the ball while on the base. Since his first birthday, I have removed the ball from the base for him to roll along the floor. He's 14 months old, and doesn't play with it much anymore. But I hope that he will start to play with it again."
5,A great learning tool for little minds!!!,"The discovery ball is a hit with both my sons (2 years and 4-1/2 months old). This is a toy that they can play with and be learning something at the same time. For now, my 4-1/2 month old son just likes listening to the music and watching the lights. My 2 year old likes to keep the ball on its base and spin it as it plays music or recites the ABC's. He realizes that when he stops spinning, the ball stops the music or ABC's, teaching him cause and effect. He also enjoys the pronunctiation mode, so when he presses any of the letters, it prounounces the sound the letter makes and he repeats it. When the ball is off its base, he likes to roll the ball around, or play catch with daddy or I (although I do not recommend it because it is not a bouncy ball, so when it is dropped, it hits the floor HARD). The toy is very durable, and I can tell this will be a toy that we will NOT be putting away anytime soon!"
2,Boring,"My daughter got this @ 7 months and she lost interest in it very quickly, even my 3 year olds would not play with it. I am hoping that they will pick it up soon and discover it all over again!"
4,All my kids like this one.,"This toy is fun for my 9 month old twins because they are just starting to like rolling balls and they get a ""response"" from this one. My 3 year old loves it because he is just getting into his abc's and it's great for learning which letters are which and the sounds they make. I feel like my babies will still be using this when they are 3! It also is very sturdy and has been thrown around a lot."
2,Good Idea needs a little work...,"The overall product and idea are great, but the most educational part of the toy needs work. When baby moves the ball, it starts the alphabet and goes to a certain point. Unless it is moved again in a very short period of time, it will start at the beginning again, hence, baby/toddler and parents get tired of ""ABCD"" and ""ABCD"" and ""ABCD."" My son would never know the latter part of the alphabet if we relied soley on this to teach him. Also, the 26 different songs it claims to play are really just different organizations of the same computer tones, with the exception of a few well knowns like Mary Had a Little Lamb and B-I-N-G-O. Finally, when pressing the letters to hear the sounds they make, you have to move the ball and so 80% of the time you'll get the start of the alphabet again before you get the sound of the letter you have chosen to hear - it's just confusing and needs a little work!"
5,encouraged my daughter to crawl before 5 months!,"My brother bought this for my daughter when she was 3 months old. She was immediately taken with it, and by 4 months was able to ""inchworm"" across the floor to get to it. Before 5 months, she was crawling to get to it. I guess she probably would have been an early ""traveller"" anyway, but this toy seriously motivated her. She still only spins it (at 6.5 months) because she doesn't have the dexterity to push the individual letters yet."
3,Maybe still too early for my son ...,"I got the Discovery Ball for my son's Christmas gift, he was about 6 month old at the time. It wasn't as hot as other review said it to be. Maybe my son is still too young for it, but even at 13 month old now, he's still not very interested. He would roll the ball few times (which sings the same song), then he would run off do something else. Hopefully, he'll enjoy it more later.Personally I thought pressing the letter is too hard for a baby, it should be design to be easily press. Also the song should stay the same after you press a letter and don't change after you roll. Anyway, overall I'm a bit disappointed, I guess because my wife and her cousin got him a better gift so I'm just jealous :-p"
3,"fun, but question safety","My 6 month old daughter loves this toy, but I have recently taken it away from her because she keeps getting her tiny fingers stuck between the spinning ball and the ""arms"" that hold the ball in place. Because of the textured rubber that the ball is made of her skin gets pulled by the spinning ball when she gets her finger(s) stuck. I contacted Leapfrog. Once I told them that she wasn't injured (just a little boo-boo) the CSR told me that she'd file a safelty complaint and that I MIGHT hear back from the company later in the week. I expected more from the company...I will be returning this very fun toy."
5,My triplets love it!!,"My mother bought this toy for my triplet's first Christmas, they were 6 months old. They loved it. They are now 15 months old and still love it. There are still some things they don't know how to do yet but then there is something new for them to learn down the road. I am sure your child will love it too."
2,Frustrating toy,I'm surprised this toy gets as many positive comments as it does. The fact that the selected song stops playing as soon as the ball is moved is very frustrating for my baby and me.Maybe we'll both like it better when she's older (she's 16 months and got it when she was about 10 months).
5,another win from Leap Frog,"Leap Frog is one of our favorite brands - and our daughter's interest in their toys prove us right! This discovery ball was a gift last christmas when she was just a few months old, and she still likes it today, if not moreso. The music/phonics/ABC modes entertain her and will no doubt be beneficial as she learns more and more. I'd recommend this product anyday, and for either an infant or toddler."
4,Wonderful toy,I am really impressed by Lep Frogs line of toys. My daughter is only 9 months old but she really likes this toy. I didn't think she would be that interested in making the ball spin but she loves it. It's very durable and it has 3 different modes of learning. She loves that you have to keep spining it to get it to finish the alphabet.
4,A Great Buy,"We like the fact that the toy has two volume options and that the voice seems very real when she sings the ABC song. I think it has a lot to offer kids of varying ages. You can learn the ABCs by letters, by phonetics, and listen to all the wonderful instrumental songs on the third mode. Our daughter is 13 months and we have not taken it off the base yet but look forward to her having some more fun rolling it around."
2,Not Impressed,"Ok, granted it only cost twenty bucks, but I was not impressed with this at all. First of all, don't ever spill anything on it, you will never get it clean. You can't get in all the teeney cracks without submerging it. Second, the volume cuts out every once in a while, and it's inaudible. Third, Once my daughter was a little older we took it out of the base, I could just get done vacumming the carpets and still this toy would find the only cat hair or fuzzy in the room and cling to the ball. Where after my daughter would try to eat it off. And finally after 4 months, only half of the letters work, and you had to push rather hard to begin with. I would not recommend this product at all, If you like the leap frog brand try Baby Tad. That was an amzing toy which my daughter loved and so did I."
5,The Best Toy on the Market....,"I just purchased the Discovery Ball today after reading the excellent reviews on Amazon. IT IS WONDERFUL! My 11 month old son loves it. He will not stop playing with it. He loves to bat the ball and hear the alphabet. I am impressed that once it stops he will spin it again to get it to go.There are a couple of choices with this toy. You can either choose to ""sing"" the alphabet or play music. I prefer the alphabet to music because of the educational value, however the music is nice too... It is nice though, to have the option to remove it from it's base.What a great toy!"
3,Maybe we're missing something,"This toy was fun for about two days. Then she wanted to hear a different song, but the only way to do that is to press one of the letters and then not move the ball. The first mode encouraged you to move the ball, but if you want a new song you shouldn't move the ball. That just turned out to be frustrating. So this one is sitting in the pile of ""might turn out to be interesting again at a later stage"" toys. I hope there's some control we're just missing, because this toy has great potential and was a near miss."
2,OK BUT BETTER ABC TOYS...,"I got this for my daughter for her first bithrday. She loved it right away & started playing with it still in the box! Well, 2 1/2 weeks later, it is still in the box, because as much as she loves it (I let her play with in her high chair while I prepare dinner), all she can do is spin the ball. The letters were certainly not designed for little hands. My daughter has never had a problem with any buttons before (ex: tv remotes, she can turn the tv on & off, she can turn her other toys on & play with them...), but this one, just frustrates her. I have not yet gone back to BRU or any other store that would carry this toy to see if maybe this is a defect, but unfortunately I am probably going to have to return it. She also received the leapfrog radio & the bus for her b-day which she loves (which all teach the alphabet) ... I must say, that I am dissappointed this time with Leapfrog!"
4,This is my second time buying this toy for my son...,"This is a great toy...I purchased this as a 'monthly birthday gift' for my son when he turned 6 months old and he loves spinning the ball to see the lights, hearing the music and the alphabet spoken in a (pleasant) woman's voice. It is visually appealing even when not in use (enticing to a child), sturdy and I enjoy tinkering with it when I can pry it away from him (usually at nap time). My only problem with this toy (why I am replacing it), is the difficulty I experienced while attempting to replace the batteries---the screws are so tiny, the manufacturer should include a tiny screwdriver (as every household does not have one) to better facilitate this necessary task. Other than that, I highly recommend this toy and I am even going to buy the Discovery Ball in Spanish when it becomes available."
2,Disappointing,My 7-month-old son does like the music and the sounds but he just spins the wheel a few times and then goes off to find a different toy. I think the letter buttons should be more sensitive for my sons' little fingers.
4,Will enjoy more with age,"I brought this for my son, and when he turned 8 months old, he seemed to enjoy more. He understood that he had to spin the ball, in order for it to keep going. I think he'll enjoy it more as he gets older and more into the alphabet learning stage."
1,Didn't Like It,"Although the product information says that it plays 26 songs, it only plays one song when it spins. So if your child presses a letter (not something that most young babies can do, so you'll have to keep doing it), it does play a different nursery tune, and as soon as that ball starts spinning again...back to the default tune. I thought that on Alphabet mode it would play the Alphabet song all the way through once as one reviewer below said, but it does not.I had bought this with 2 goals in mind: to encourage my daughter to crawl, and to introduce her to different nursery tunes as well as the whole alphabet song. I thought it was lame, and my daughter lost interest in it, too, after only a couple of spins."
2,There are better options,"I got this for my 9 month old daughter. It was neat at first, the music was entertaining. But now it just sits in the toy box. When it is out avaialable for play, she won't chose it. I agree with another review, the letters are to small and the concept is just not there for little ones. There are better options than this toy. I would not pay this again. Not worth the cost."
2,"I don't know why, but my son doesn't like this toy...","It looks like a wonderful toy. My son is two and a half and has had this toy since his first birthday. He doesn't like it. I'm not sure why; he loves the Leapfrog Phonics bus which is similar in concept.He'll play with the Discovery Ball for a few minutes then wander away. The batteries died simply because it was left on pressed up against something -- not from use. I'm hoping someday he'll start enjoying this toy.I have to say I was nearly in tears trying to change the batteries on this toy. Honestly, it's the hardest battery change I've ever gone through in my entire life! And I almost injured myself because there was a lot of prying involved. The diagrams on the toy are so faint and tiny that you can hardly figure out what to do.I will not curse my new nephew by getting him this toy. When he's old enough, I'm getting him the Leapfrog Phonics bus instead!"
1,My kids barely played with it.,"I have a 3 year old, 2 year old and 7 month old. The 3 year old received this as a gift years ago and hardly ever played with it. Same with her 2 year old sister. I am hoping that my 7 month old son will but I am doubting it. It just never captured their interest. There are definitely BETTER products out there which can teach ABCs."
4,Great toy but the short A sound says short O,"My son loves playing with this toy. It is very educational. My only complaint is that I noticed that the A sound is incorrect. Instead of saying short A, it says short O. If Leap Frog corrects this mistake, it will be a perfect toy."
4,7-month-old loves it,"Our son is 7 months and loves things that he can spin, which is why we got him this. Balls that roll away are no good as he's not really crawling. I am glad to see it does come off the stand, though it is definitely too heavy to throw! He learned very quickly that the song stops when he doesn't spin it, and he'll spin it again. He doesn't play with it for long, but it's good for a few minutes at a time, and I love that it's small enough to take upstairs and set in his crib with him while I brush my teeth or carry to another room to play. I don't expect any of these toys to make him a genius, but it doesn't hurt to reinforce alphabet lessons. Contrary to what other reviewers say, he is easily able to get it to say a letter by pressing that letter. Not that he is doing it on purpose, but he can do it."
4,Ok toy,"What I really liked about this toy was that it would teach my child fine motor skills, as well as the alphabet. But so far (my son is 11 months) it has only taught him how to unroll the toilet paper on the roll. :) But I think as he gets older he will have fun rolling it around on the floor (not attached to the base) since it plays music as it moves. It may also be beneficial as he gets older and learning his letters since one setting sounds out the letter the baby pushes. I think six months may be a little young for this toy."
4,9 month old not too interested yet,"We have purchased this toy for several friends as gifts in the past, and they all reported that their children loved the toy so we were sure it would be a great toy for our son. At 9 1/2 months, he is just starting to show some interest in spinning it, but he does not yet have any interest in pushing any letters. I am holding out hope that he will continue to develop an interest in it, because I think it is very well made."
4,Daughter Loves Moms can stand,"My daughter recieved this for her 1st Birthday and has not stopped playing with it. She loves dancing to it as it sings the alphabet and she freezes when it stops, after about 20 mins. she realized that if she kept it spinning it didn't stop singing."
5,Love It! Got to Get It!,"I bought this for my daughter when she was about 6 1/2 months old. She instantly started to play with it. Well, now she is 14 months old and she still loves it. But now, I have actually caught her singing the ABC song along with the toy. This is DEFINANTLY a MUST HAVE Toy."
2,Volume is too loud,"My daughter received this for her first Christmas. The songs the ball plays are great, but they don't last that long, especially if the ball is moved mid-stream. The volume control I thought would be a good thing, but it turns out it doesn't lower the volume enough--it is still very loud! I don't see how this can captivate a child long enough to be of any educational value."
2,not too exciting,"This toy didn't keep the attention of either of my kids. The letters on the ball are way too small (and hard) for little fingers to press correctly in order to hear the letter sounds/songs. It also calls you back to play by chiming out a little ditty. This is enough to drive you crazy. When the child is done playing (which is rather quickly) it will do this little song, over and over. Also it is way too heavy to be off the sttionary platform. A kid can roll it, but watch out! Don't use too much power (this is reasonable with an adult or a baby, not so much with a two year old)"
1,not my favorite,"While the toy is ""Educational"" sings alphabet, and plays soft but catchy music not to annoying for parents, the base after time doesnt keep the ball secure.The ball is heavy, and will come apart after a fair amount of play. When your child learns to THROW, you will want to hide this. Its heavy and it hurts when it hits you.When the ball seperates as if you were changing batteries and it will, the plastic edges are a tad but sharp.I do not recommend this toy."
1,Useless and dangerous!!!,"This toy is annoying and useless. My 1 year old son got it as a birthday present and he just spin it every day for 30 seconds. That's it what he can do with it!!! I showed him how to push the letters, but those letters are so little... and they aren't look like buttons, so he doesn't think he should push them! If I take the ball out, my 3 years old starts to play with it and throw it, but it is too heavy for that kind of play so it is dangerous!!!I don't suggest it, it is just waste of money!"
1,Leap Frog Discovery Ball,"This was given to my son by my moter-in-law. It is loud and the womens voice on the recording is VERY annoying. I believe sing ABC's and songs to our son is more ""EDUCATATIONAL"" then someone else."
2,Irritating,"I think the premise behind this toy is great. But, it doesn't matter what song you pick, the second the ball moves at all it switches back to it's regular song. It's nearly impossible for a 2 year old to understand that once they pick the song, they can't touch the ball."
3,Mixed feelings on this one,My 12 month old son is not interested in it any longer. He has never wanted to press the individual letters to enjoy the full functionality of this toy. I agree with others that say that is is slightly annoying. He played with this one for only a few short months. I wouldn't recommend this one.
2,Extremely Disappointing and Frustrating Toy.,"I bought this toy for my 8-month-old daughter. Right away we discovered the most rediculous feature imaginable in a toy: namely, that in ""music"" mode, when the child pushes one of the letters that plays a new song, the child then naturally wants to spin the ball-- but doing so makes the song stop! The toy then reverts to one of 2 intensely boring melodies. For a child as young as mine who can spin the ball well but has difficulty pressing the letters, the toy only plays a couple of dull songs-- not much incentive to play with the toy. For a somewhat older child who CAN press the letters, there is a different tune for each letter-- but the tune stops as soon as you spin the ball! So, the child is punished for spinning the ball! I HATE this toy. In order for my daughter to hear a song, I have to prevent her from spinning the ball, and hold it still. More like punishment than fun. She has entirely stopped wanting to play with this toy."
1,Waste of money,"Dont bother with this ostrich. The one I received had been incorrectly stitched together. The draw point for me in choosing this ostrich were its allegedly adorable eyelashes, but on mine, they are stitched on as ears."
2,ok toy,Toy was not like what picture showed on the actual toy they put large ears when on the picture there are none it looks very odd
1,sleep-maker,"Didn't know what boredom was until I heard this CD. Fortunately, I was able to re-sell through Amazon"
4,Food for thought,"A typical understated UK spy movie of 1960. Instead of relying on blood and gore and action shots, the movie has intelligent (and intelligible) dialogue and good actors. It raises the important issue of scientific integrity versus realpolitik, so important now with global warming, the Gulf oil spill etc.etc. My favourite character is the Minister (Raymond Huntley) who makes the case for realpolitik so eloquently.A small technical flaw is noticeable. The director has tried unuscessfully to pick up some of the ingredients of ""Brief Encounter"", made 15 years earlier. For example the repressed strain of the protagonists, the rather forced comic relief (with the chimpanzee) and the classical piano background. It does not quite work. Maybe it would have been better to have had some steam trains roaring by."
5,Redneck Horn,"This product is for adults only because of some of the language it uses. We had actually ordered these for a customer who seems to be very satisfied with it. Some of the phrases are pretty funny, while a few words in others could be left out. Overall, we were very satisfied with this product, we will share information of this product, and will probably be reordering again."
5,funny!,"I bought this for my husband as part of a birthday gift. He loves it! Everytime we get in the truck he has to push the button so that we can both get a laugh. I would not recommend this for children, because of language. But it is definitely hilarious!"
3,Not As Good As The Original Music Score,The Dvd Boxed Set It Is Good And All But It Dont Have The Original Music Or Sound The Music And Dialog Was Replaced By The 1980's Gumby Adventures And Some Restoration Would Of Over Coated The Horrible Music And Sound Another Thing About It Is That It Dont Have All The Episodes You'd Think Art Clokey At Least Would Have Asked Rihno Entertainment To Use the Original Score Plus Atleast Keep All The Episodes A Whole Lot Of Episodes We'r not Included Such As Mystic Magic And Wishful Thinking F.H.E. FAMILY HOME ENTERTAINMENT Has All Of the Episodes On Diffrent Tapes Plus The Original Score I Say Just Buy F.H.E. Videos From Amazon Or Ebay
3,The Original Theme Song From The 1967 Season Is Not Included,"It Was Good But Most Of The Scense On Disk One Was Missing Like ON ""LITTLE LOST PONY""Gumba (OPEN QUOTE)""SOFTEN THE TV GUMBY""She Says Before He Turns It off Plus a Blooper Real On MOON TRIP You Can See Before Gumby Leaves The Ship You Can Look North West And You Can See Art Clokey's Hand Moving Gumby The Digital Media Score Was Not Good The Music And Voices Wer Not As Good As The Original Music And Voice EffectsThe Basic Only Episode Original Score The Funny Bathtub Which Was Made In The 1980'S Season Which The Voices Sounded The Same Charles Farrington Did Good As The Voice Of Gumby"
3,Great entertainment....but the original music is not on these early episodes,"Gumby is one of the outstanding forms of entertainment. I enjoyed watching this set, but could not help but notice changes in the music on early episodes. I see I am not alone on this. Here's an additional observation. Some of the synthesizer music works well for later episodes. But it is good to see that interest in the original music is helping to restore an element that created some of the charm of the series."
1,Thanks for letting us know about the bad new sountrack...,"I was going to purchase 3 of these sets, using two of them for gifts, to introduce the kids to a great cartoon that was truly out of this world. I can't believe the compilers of a major set would actually think that people would enjoy different background music. Do they know ANYTHING about collectibility? About purists? Who is spending [the money] on a Gumby set, the casual shopper... or those who fondly remember the quirky look, feel and SOUND of theshow, and want exactly that in a compiled set? With all the information a DVD can hold, they could have made the new sountrack an option, switchable in the menu. I'll save my [money], and wait for 'The Complete Gumby (Unabridged, with original sountracks.) Thanks for the warning, all you reviewers!"
1,[bad] rhino!,"... Bad enough they took out the classic theme song but then to remove the orginal soundtracks is an absolute outrage. There is nothing on the box or in any of the advance press to tell you they futzed with the soundtrack. I had no idea these things were redone in the eighties. I'm sure the people at Rhino are too young to know the difference. This is the last Rhino product I ever buy. By the way, I only gave this one star because there is no option for zero stars! This thing deserves negative stars."
1,Soundtrack is NOT Original,"Deeply disappointed by ""updated"" soundtrack with irritating music created by a synthezier, different voices used, and completely different sound effects...If an ""original soundtrack"" version is ever offered, I will purchase it."
2,"Bad Rhino !! Naughty, naughty","I always like the original of anything. These DVD's stink. Sorry folks. To the reviewer who speculated that maybe the original music was lost ..... Impossible. I have 16MM copies of a couple of episodes that are completely intact. If nothing else, Rhino could have gone that route. Yes, the masters are usually the best, but if a 16MM is the only original left, then please use it. Thank you."
2,Shame On Me For Not Researching,"I have had my heart set on owning this box for months...however, I didn't realize until today when I finally had it in my hands and in my player that I had not once checked any Amazon reviews. I guess I would never in my wildest dreams imagine that Rhino would screw up so badly, and mis-lead (by mentioning nothing) so severely. It's true that finding these treasures so de-faced can cause severe depression and feelings of being betrayed in a middle-aged collector. The fact that they managed to collect almost all the cartoons and the art pieces in one box is impressive and admirable -- but the nauseating scores and re-dubbed voices make it almost impossible to maintain the gratitude. What's even more depressing, it is completely unlikely that this will ever be corrected. Ah, life is a bitter mystery!"
1,Buyer BEWARE!!! Shame on Rhino,"I want my money back. I thought Rhino was all about celebrating the originality, creativity, and genius of past media. So why is it they're duping us with defaced work here? This is an absolute OUTRAGE. The magic that is Gumby has been all but trashed. The beautiful, eerie, awe-inspiring soundtrack that included original compositions, all sort of innovative sound effects, and the great character voices have been replaced with a modern ""Barney"" mix. I want to cry. I thought Rhino would understand the importance of sound having started out in the audio product business. This is clearly a case of bottom line or ignorance or both. F- ."
4,Sharing Nostalgic Moments!,"This package may disappoint purists because of newly created animated ""bumpers"" in between segments, a synthesizer score from the '80's rather then the original music ... and perhaps other small ""knits."" I purchased it, however, to share with my two small boys and it was (and remains) a hit!A beautifully crafted package for the 7 discs, lots of episodes and a small Gumby toy made it well worth the purchase for some family fun time. I have been collecting DVD's of shows from my youth, to share with my kids and this has been a great addition to the collection."
4,"Lighten Up - It's Gumby, People!","Negative reviews of this box complain about the ""new"" musical soundtrack (still thirty years + old, but not the original) and bumpers, but this is an excellent hunk of Gumby. Not the perfect package for reliving childhood memories (if you're old enough to have seen the original broadcasts) but perfectly adequate for showing today's kids and entertaining them hugely. The sly square/hip wit is still intact, and the synthesizer score is not nearly as bad as it could be. The material itself holds considerable charms, especially when the characters shut up and surreal events unfold. If you can find this package for a reasonable price and want your claymation in a super-size party-pack, go for it."
2,Gumby...ruined!,I heard that the reason that the original musics were changed was because of who owned the copyright . In any case it's ridiculous to release the classic Gumby in this way. I bought two of the volumes fortunately i didn't waste my money on this box set. If you love old Gumby then don't buy this set or you will be very disappointed. Cheesey 80s synth sounds and echoey voices. Booo!
1,Vintage Trash,What the hell is this soundtrack? I heard it and was crushed. And then Classic Media butchered the Underdog Show for me. Doesn't anybody have any respect for the sacredness of the past? Vintage is always kept as is in as prestine condition as possible. I am so hurt by these rip-off boxsets that ruin the greatness of the past. My friend bought it and weeped. They better not screw with Lancelot Link when they come out with the complete series!
1,What a disaster!,"Who in their right mind would release a classic like Gumby with all of the 80's stupid/silly sounding music! We want ""Gumby"" how Gumby was! Since I spent my almost 100.00, the box set has been sitting on a shelf in my garage! I was so upset, and felt I was taken advantage of. If they had put, ""Sound not original"", somewhere on the box, I would not have purchased it, nor many others.Sigh..."
5,Gumby boxed set,"This Gumby boxed set was really well done. I love it. It starts with the first gumby episode in 1956 and goes in order of production all the way to 1968. It's awsome to see the transition of styles through the years. My two kids are really enjoying it also. They keep watching till I turn it off. For me, the best part was the 7th disc with the art films. They are mind blowing. I give it a 5 star rating out of 5. Of course, I'm a Gumby fan, but it really is great to have all of these great episodes in one package. Rick Stephens"
2,John McFarren,This product didn't have the results I expected. Did not raise my Low T level as advertised. I will not be reordering. In fact if it had a gurantee I would request one.
2,Beware the wire,I thought the price was a little steep. The sound was better than my Altec Lansing AHS 302 (Don't even bother) but after 1 week the flimsy wire started to give me mic static. This is confirmed from a friend who had the same unit. Can't use it anymore.
1,Logitech Headsets,"I recently bought, and returned the next day, a Logitech headset which connected to the audio inputs of my MAC G4. The microphone was apparently dead out of the box. I have had similar quality problems with products from this company before.JRR"
2,bad mechanical design,"I had it for 10 months, used it daily for internet voice chat and a bit of music listening. No big demands. Had clear sound, the mic was fine, the USB convenient. However, although I treated the unit with utmost care, after 10 months the wires in the cable connected to the inline volume controller broke up, and I could hear the sound through the phones only at a specific cable bending angle. Then, after 3 days, the wires totally gave up. I can not get to the wires since the volume unit seems to be welded together. Will try to get RMA."
2,Definitely Not for a Gamer(or people with big heads),"I feel cheated by Logitech on this one. Though the mid and high frequency sounds are great, this headset offers nothing on the bottom end. It can probably handle it however there are no settings to increase the bass.The USB system acts as its own soundcard and uses an ""extremely basic"" driver from windows giving you minimum settings to change the sound quality(Logitech didn't make a driver for this headset). To make a long story short the only option you have is volume control and balance, nothing else.Another problem is that I find I cannot wear the headset for long periods of time as there is a lot of pressure on the head. Of course I have a big fat head.The price is simply not worth it. Look for something else.(My Microsoft Game Voice Headset is better than this and cost half the price)"
2,Nice concept bad execution,Headphones and mic work well enough. Though I had the same problem as the Dr right out of the box. It tries to adjust the volume to zero. My work around was a tube of Chapstick and a mini wood clamp to hold the up volume control button in. This causes the volume adjustment to stop so I could use the headset. I like it but it's definitely getting returned/exchanged.
2,Volume control died,"I bought this headset last xmas (Dec 04) and about a week ago it got into the set-volume-to-zero mode described by others here. After hours of debugging, I managed to disabled just the volume controller using Windows XP's device manager. This confirmed that it was the inline volume control that was stuck on decrease mode. The headset now works as before except for the disabled volume control I didn't use anyway. If it had not broken, I would've rated it 4 stars."
5,AWESOME PRODUCT,"I loved this body bar. It smelled nice, rinsed clean, and the pouch was just rough enough to slough the dead skin but not too rough that it was uncomfortable. I used it on my little boy, too! I would definitely recommend this prodcut and will buy it again!!"
5,Immersed In the Atmosphere,"Usually I wouldn't take the time to write things in, but I bought this CD on a lark due to the links in here, and I like it more than the original CD which I came to buy. You totatlly feel like you are immersed in the Greek culture, but not in a cheesey way. Definitely a lot of fun to listen to. A great CD for listening to with guests to create a great atmostphere."
4,The Greek Music is Great,"I loved the strong rhythms and colorful harmonies of the traditional Greek numbers. The film score is lyrical but bland. This truly is a combination of ""apples and oranges!"""
5,Amazingly Relaxing CD!,"This is a great instrumental CD! Not only great greek music that you can get up and dance to, but also the soft contemporary songs that you can just relax with. I enjoy it very much!"
2,"Greek music is excellent. The ""other"" is very ordinary","I ordered this album for its excellent original greek music.Unfortunately, de rest of the music (ordinary film music) is not worth a cent."
1,Great disappointment on amazon's shipping method,"I had ordered this particular CD. However, After the second tried. i am yet to receive the CD. And i was really hoping the second CD could appear in my doorstep on the expected arrival date or 1 week later.To be honest, This is the first time i didn't manage to receive my good from E-commerce Portal. I totally didnt expect this happen from reputable Amazon.Nonetheless. I must admit your friendly customer service, they are always willing to assist me to reprocess or the refund the marchant.Please kindly review your shipping method. or perhaps let me know what had happened to my shipping address or my goods. so i could still have confident to make purchase on your website again."
4,Love this little comb,"I have a toy breed dog and was a little perplexed at the scale of grooming tools at the pet stores. At first when the comb arrived, I was shocked at the small size - then I remembered it is four inches! This was the PERFECT SIZE. My puppy is 8 lbs poodle/shih tzu, and she's not alarmed by the comb when I bring it near her (as she is when she sees the scissors but that is another story). It is small enough that I can comb the hair on her tiny face and on the brigde of her muzzle (which can't be more than 2 inches). I can get the eye crud/dirt flecks out of her fur with this comb. It is sturdy and durable. I've ad it for a couple months and use it once a week at least and don't expect that the teeth of the comb will bend or warp- it is that sturdy."
2,Dog comb,"I have a shaggy dog, with very dense fur. I have been using this comb for about a month and a half, and now the teeth are starting to fall out."
1,expecting longer teeth based on the reviews,"based on the reviews, i was expecting longer teeth. Even if you include the base of the comb, the length of the teeth in the description is exaggerated. The teeth on the comb are just like any other comb i've purchased. I'd rather have a comb with an ergomomic handle to grasp if i'm not going to get longer teeth. Sorry i'm returning it."
1,Safaro Fine/Medium Comb,"[...]I purchased this product to replace a comb that I have had for many years and recently lost. I wanted a fine/medium comb that was about 8"" long with one end (about 4"") being finely spaced teeth and the other end (about 4"") being medium spaced teeth. The description of this item lead me to believe that is what I was ordering.I was extremely disappointed when this product arrived. It was described as a comb that is 8"" long. It is really only about 4"" long total. I wanted the comb to use on my cats entire body. I am not sure what one would use this comb for, but it certainly will not work on a cats body. I have never even opened the comb and tried it. I would have returned it, however there was no information included with the comb as to what a person could do, if they did want to return it. So the bottom line is I wasted $10 on something that is of no use to me, because I believed the description by the seller."
4,Great replacement for metal foil units,"I urge everyone to check whether they have a ""metal foil"" duct in their dryer. These foil ducts are a fire hazard due to all of the lint that gets trapped inside of them and you should change it ASAP. This is a great, inexpensive replacement. If you go to your local hardware store, etc. you will be paying about 5x more. Be safe."
1,Dryer Duct,Store sent 2 foot section. Complained and they credited order and said they would send out again. Following week received another 2 foot section. Should have went to hardware store and purchased in the 1st place.Will buy only Amazon products from now on not sub sellers.
4,Great and Silly episodes,"The DVD's are well coordinated and the menus are easy to follow. The clarity is excellent.Farscape was (and I specify was) one of the best new SciFi series out. I recommend all episodes in season one and season two however, starting with the ending of season three it has become silly and juvenile. Chreiton's brain implant is becomming redundant and needs to be resolved. I do not plan on purchasing any additional episodes (perhaps even watching) unless they get new writers (someone over the age of 12 at least)for the upcoming episodes.LETS HOPE THEY RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL CONCEPTS OF THE SERIES."
5,Oh My God The Best Show Ever,I have to sey I was not all that in to Farscape at first but then I saw the dvd and thought ok it would be fun to see the first few shows and then I would buy the next one and the next one you see where theis is going I love this show now to bad I don't know whats going on now but I will never miss it ever now I can't wait for Vol 12 to come out I love Farscape and you will to
5,Jackie Wilson as a Soul Man,"If you're a fan of soul music, than this is the Jackie Wilson CD for your collection. Here Jackie makes a great comeback with Carl Davis as producer and the Motown Funk Brothers as the backing band! Not only do you get the hits ""Higher and Higher"" and ""Whispers"", you also get Jackie's heartfelt singing on ""Just Be Sincere"". My personal favorite of the collection is the proto-Motown cut ""I've Lost You"" where Jackie convinces everyone that he's faced the greatest trajedy in the world because his girl doesn't love him anymore. Powerful Stuff."
5,great book,"If you're already familiar with Java but have no idea what servlets or JSPs are, you'll find this book a gem. It has useful examples. With this book, you can start making servlets and JSPs right away."
5,A Superb Book Covering BOTH Servlets and JSP!,"There are several excellent servlet and JSP books available, however what Marty Hall has done so well is combine both topics into one comprehensive title. I wanted to learn servlets to develop a web-based project. However, after awhile I discovered that I would need to incorporate JSP as well. A hallmark of of this text is that it covers both topics and integrates them nicely. The text covers much of what a Java web-developer requires and I found the coverage of beans to be particularly helpful.It is also well-written and the material is organized logically. I suggest this title as your first choice for servlet or JSP programming."
4,Nice coverage,This title provided a good coverage of Servlets and JSPs. Nice practical code examples and real world situations. This book is good in that it tries to integrate the two topics when most authors ignore the fact they should always be used as a pair. My only gripe is that they do only provide a few chapters to integrating the two technologies.
4,Clear explanation of servlets and jsp technologies,This is the book to read to have very clear and concise explanation of how to set up whole servlet/jsp environment to begin to develop your own servlets and jsp pages. Then Marty will take you on a tour on how to implement and think about implementing useful servlets explaning what's behind the technology you use. This is a very practical and useful book for anyone who wants to jump into the world of server-side java technologies and quickly become a proficient in the field.
4,good but focus too much on servlets,"It is a good book that explaines concepts clearly for beginners. However, this book is more on servlet side. It only covered basics on JSP. After reading this book, one could be misleaded to develop web application using pure servlets instead of JSP (which happened unfortunately). For better design and more updated JSP contents, I recommend Web development with JavaServer Page by Duane Fields, which stated very clearly how to design a web solution and why JSP is a better solution in most web projects. For better real world examples, I like Professional JSP published by wrox.It also only gives some very simple examples, like prime number class that is not so interesting in real world."
2,Lacks depth,"Yes, this book teaches how to write a servlet/jsp but you are still going to need to look at a professional level book such as Java Servlet Programming (O'Reilly) by Jason Hunter. Hall's book leaves too many details out. I have the same criticism of the More blah blah book as well. Get the O'Reilly book to begin with and save the time for reading Hunter."
3,Looks very good but confusing,"Spent a lot of time on this book and find the first chapter is already dated. Had a hard time configuring Apache Tomcat 3.2.1 which is ahead of the book. The author graciously gave me a link to 3.1 which did the trick. Now however I am stuck in chapter 2 regarding invoking servlets. Again this is not very clear and I think the author assumes you already know JAVA in detail. That you know what CLASSPATH and packages are because the descriptions are very sketchy. I was able to compile his sample code but have no idea how to invoke them. He tries to give you the generic steps for all the possible web servers, but I just want a step by step approach for Tomcat 3.2.1. Looks like a good book if you have the basics down. I certainly don't and therefore don't find this book too helpful in getting started. I either need more detailed follow-up information from the author or need to find a more remedial book."
5,Very useful,"I have enjoyed reading this book, clear explanations with useful code examples. It is great that the author put together all related technologies. I will recommend it to my coworkers and friends as the book not only on servlets and JSP but also on web programming for java programmers."
2,Not so good at explaining concepts,"I am a hard-core JSP developer. I do not own this book. However, one of my friends show me two paragraphs of the book that he did not understand.These 2 paragraphs were poorly written.""Chapter 12.2 Including at Rquest Time"".It is talking about <jsp:include> action. One sentence said,""On the other the page has been already been translated into a servlet by request time, so the included files cannot contain JSP.""The words ""cannot contain"" is very misleading. It should say something like, ""<jsp:include> cannot make the including JSP contains the *source* of included JSP."""
1,This book will teach you how to be a bad JSP programmer,"Total waste of money and time. This book is like a syntax reference. It fools you to believe that you are learning JSP. I DID NOT READ IT UNTIL THE END, BUT I THINK IT DOES NOT MENTION THE MVC PARADIGM. I don't have time to write all the reasons why this book is not worth your money. So just believe me: There are better books about JSP/Servlet."
5,Best Book on the topics of JSP and Servlets,The author has put in a lot of effort into introducing the topic in a very lucid and 'immediately try it out' manner. His sense of humor also shows through in many parts of the book making an otherwise dry topic a very interesting one. I find this book to be the best one to start with and to keep as a reference for Web application development using JSP and Servlets.
4,Core Servlets/JSP -- exactly what it says,"Excellent reference guide for JSP and servlet information. The author has a knack for explaining things in ways that programmers understand not only the how but also the why. This is not a text for beginners, but instead hits its target dead on -- somewhat experienced java developers moving from enterprise applications to web-apps.If you want to learn about java and HTML, get Core Web Programming. If you understand java and HTML, but not servlets, then get Core Servlets.While there is room for improvement, there isn't much. The only significant improvement would be to include a DVD of the author's live presentations -- those make the book seem weak."
3,Good book but not detailed enough for a professionel project,"Sorry, I don't understand the hype about this book. No doubt, it is a good book but it has to less detailed informationen if you plan a professionel project with servlets and JSPs. Additional, you need a more verbose book concerning JSPs (e.g. Fields / Kolb ""WebDevelopment with JavaServer Pages""), where you find details about architectural issues and practical issues like form validation with memento pattern. Three stars as standalone book; five stars in conjunction with Fields/Kolb book."
3,Obsolete Technologies,"Wanting to learn servlet programming, I bought this book, but had to return it for a refund. This book is based on the older technologies. Why are they still selling this book? To be honest I don't know how many stars I should give this book, so I just put 3."
5,The Book and Marty are really help,"Before I bought this book, I browsed couple servlet books in bookstores. The book he written, It's really good book. + He replyed to my question very clear and make me learn faster."
5,A Rave,"I just got Core Servlets book, and I think it is great. I have spent the last month trying to learn the basics from the download of jsdwk-1.0.1 and tomcat 3.1 and searching for a book that was not fatally out of date. Then last week three people independently recommended this book. I looked at the summaries on Amazon and ordered it, sight unseen. And am I ever glad I did. It is the perfect mix of simple examples to start with, followed by more complex and useful ones.I am impressed."
5,Instant Understanding!,"My company asked me to become an ""expert"" in JSP in a time span of about 4 days so I could translate at a technical meeting for them. I'd worked with the Web before and had heard of JSP/Servlets, but couldn't do a whole lot with them. This book has proved to be a fantastic resource. I've read the entire book in two days and now have enough information to discuss the subject with our consultants. A must have!"
5,Best book for learning server side scripting with Java,"This is an excellent book for learning server side scripting using Java. The book has adequate examples and some serious code snippets that one would find very useful in web development. For example, one of the chapters covers database connection pooling. Marty Hall has a nice way of explaining things, through real world examples. His style of coding is also consistent and easy to grasp.The book covers both servlets and JSP, equally well. It would be nice for the new editions of the book to discuss about servlet containers like Tomcat. Also, these editions could possibly cover XML, XSLT etc, in the context of web development.In all, this is a great book on servlets and JSP. It is worth the investment."
5,"impressive, should be your first Servlet/JSP book","I read this book from cover to cover (well, almost) and found it very useful. I know Java but had no prior Servlet/JSP knowledge and the book was able to bring me up to speed. The explanation is concise and precise, good enough to get you started. Another similar book is ""Web Development with JavaServer Pages,"" which covers more detail in JSP. I would recommend beginners to read this one second and Marty's book first to get the most out of it."
1,Why can't I give it 0 stars,"Total watse of the money. Full of useless information (like the mime type of lotus notes files). I would expect a book that had JSP and Servlets in the title would actually talke about them in depth. There are a lot of useless examples that you want to skip, but then you end up skipping the 10% of useful information too."
4,Good but not excellent.,"I rushed out to buy this book because this was the only book with all the five star ratings. In my opinion it may be slightly over-rated, but it may just be the best book on Servlet and JSP. It gives a good overview of what you need to write an application with plenty of samples, but the author can be more articulated about how the pieces fit together and why they work the way they do. Finally, the only topic I felt did not get enough attention was JDBC, as many sites today are database driven."
4,Good Intro Book,"This book was a good INTRODUCTION book to Servlets/JSP. It doesn't provide a COMPLETE overview of Servlets and JSP but it hits on the most basic concepts of them. Some of the examples, at the time of writing, did not work...i.e - the Custom Tags. They even stated that they worked with a beta version of Tomcat 3.1 but mentioned nothing of it not working on JWS 2.0. Nonetheless, I skipped that chapter because the examples did not appear to work at all. The ONLY way however to learn Servlets/JSP from this book is by doing the examples presented in the text. Otherwise, you could breeze through the book and then going back going, ""what do i do now?"" Unless you practice or try the examples, getting a grasp on the concepts and ideas presented in the text is difficult. It's still a good introduction book and I would recommend it to anyone. I've even bought Core's complement to JSP, CORE JSP, as well and am looking forward to seeing how interesting that would be."
4,Good overall Concepts but not a Bible.,"The Core servlet and jsp book is very good for beginers, but if you already know java servlet programming look for some thing else may be Oreilly's book. This is a concept book with working code examples but less of details and intricacies. Quite evident if you see it covers Servlets, JSP, connection to JDBC( only 50 odd pages) in around 500 odd pages. ""JACK OF ALL MASTER OF NONE """
3,Great only for some,"it is fair to say that half of the books is dedicated to printouts of programming examples. Thus if you enjoy reading telephone books, this book is definitely a goody. Still the remaining content pages are now and then worth to read."
3,"Does the trick, but flimsy","This does the trick and diverts the air away from my plants in the window and was an inexpensive solution. That being said, they are flimsy and easily come apart. I've broken the tabs off of more than one by dropping it and one came broken in the package and I taped it together as it wasn't worth returning. I'd happily pay more for something stronger and more heavy duty."
2,It works...but...,"Some reviews say you can use this for electric baseboard heaters. If your home uses electric baseboard heaters, you know how hot those things get. But, if your A/C unit happens to sit right above the your baseboard heater, you also know that you absolutely need something to deflect that heat from the A/C unit because that heat will melt whatever plastic in your A/C unit.This air deflector works...and it's the only product out there that will fit onto a baseboard heater (with magnets, it's perfect). But --- WARNING --- do not turn up your thermostat to above 65. To keep the relatively small room at 65 the baseboard heater cranked up enough heat to melt the middle pieces of our Deflecto: I mean twisted, melted no-longer looked like what it had been type of melted.Still, it worked for us for one winter, when we did not turn the heat up past 65. Just a warning!"
2,Very low quality,"Purchased two and decided to try them out even though there were mixed reviews. They do not hold very well, weak magnet. One easily broke in half in first few days. I am sure it was bumped by kids. However, the quality is very poor. Flimsy and thin. Not worth buying."
1,cheap,They are cheap. I would not recommend them to my worst enemy. I just put up shorter curtains. That work better.
3,Used for Fujitsu Wall Unit,"Used this on my Fujitsu wall unit that kept hitting me in the eyes in my office. Put it in front of the air outlet and on top of my bookcase. Used a few quarters underneath to stabilize and it works although it is not exactly what I wanted. There is no other substitute though, that I could find. Works for me."
3,needs anchoring,"Where I have it it has a sturdy back support and since it's in a crowded place, there will usually be something to prevent it from tipping forward. But, it really does need anchoring to prevent both bodily harm and damage to itself as well as the contents. Sometimes the drawers need coaxing to go back in. It would be better if the drawers were a tad wider, I store disks in sleeves in it (rather than jewel cases) and they have to be stored on their sides (gee, I thought sleeve were square, turns out they're not quite square.)The cabinet looks fantastic, as a retired librarian, the look of a card catalog is nostalgic for me. The finish is nice, smooth, with uniform wood staining. For me it's perfect, but the tipsiness is a consideration for normal positioning."
1,disappointing in all respects,"The front cover of the book says this is a ""Guide to Advanced Design Features"" and the back cover rates the book as ""User Level: Intermediate to Advanced. I don't believe that is an accurate description at all.The examples have designs that may have looked okay 6 or 7 years ago, but I think they are just terrible. The directions and files provided for the sample projects are confusing and inadequate.This is -- by far -- the worst computer book I have ever read. I only wish I could get a refund. Buyer beware!"
2,Great book but the pages are falling out,"It's a fantastic book, but the first time we looked thru it the pages were falling out. Very poor quality binding."
4,Great images....poor binding.,"This guide to collecting all things Tiki is great value with each glossy page full of clear, good quality photos. It is heavily weighted towards Tiki mugs, with two thirds of the book devoted to those. The rest of the book show examples of matchbooks, postcards, swizzle sticks, ashtrays etc. There are around 20 pages devoted to Coco Joes, HIP and other 'Lava' statues.My only gripe is that the first time I opened the book, the pages fell out!! It's pretty disappointing, considering this would be a book you would thumb through often, for reference as you collect. This really needs to be addressed I feel.I had this shipped to Australia, and it arrived promptly."
5,Fun fun fun!!!,This toy makes my 16 month old laugh and laugh and he loves the songs. Makes learning numbers fun. The noise factor is easily resolved by putting some scotch tape over the speaker area and makes it much more bearable. Nothing but good things to say so far!!
2,Looks like a cool toy to me,"My daughter received this for her 1st birthday. Basically she is scared by it which is unusual, she plays with all toys and is not a shy girl. When I turn it on and try to play she cries. I even had to hide it, she does not like the looks of it I guess.All the other reviews I've read are great, maybe it's just us."
2,"Weak magnet, will not stick",These Deflecto vent covers are thin and are not strong enough to hold up on ceiling vents. It may work for floor vents.
1,this item sucks!,"Wasted hard earned money. This item is too heavy and magnetic force too weak to stick to vents it's inteded for. Tried it on several types of vents, even purchased new vents to accomodate it. It falls off quickly or within a minute and that's w/o any air pressure!"
3,"OK, could be better","Great idea. Easy to size & fit, but they're just barely magnetic. By itself it would not work with a ceiling-mounted vent -- even with vent fully closed the air flow blew the magnetic cover off."
1,Don't buy,Do not buy this product the magnetic is not strong enough to hold on ceiling vents.I need to purchase additional magnetics to hold up the Magnetic vent cover. haha
2,May work for somebody else,"I have a vent directly over my bed. Tried this product to cover it up. Even with the vent switched over to the closed position, if the heat or air was blowing, the magnet in this product is not strong enough to stay stuck to the vent. I even tried to put glue dots around the edge to help it stay put. This worked to keep it in place for about a week. I have standard vent covers in my home."
1,It does not work,"It does not work. The magnet vent covers only stick to other magnet covers in the packet.I should have paid attention to other reviews. Instead of saving energy and money (as advertised),I've wasted even more money on this product."
2,"Okay, but not great.","We cut these to fit over our vents in the basement since those vents did not have a way to close them. We have gas, forced air. Sometimes they stayed up, but sometimes the air would blow them off. There has to be something better out there."
1,Stop -- Don't Buy This,"I bought this product in a hurry without looking at the reviews. The reviews are right. The magnets on these vent covers are so weak that they will not stick to ceiling vents or even wall vents. I returned this product, but the postage for mailing it back cost me half the original price of the product. Don't make the same mistake. Buy the real thing at your local hardware store instead."
5,It does what it's meant to do,"Great product, was a little scared from past products that the air blowing out the vent would blow it off....NOPE!! Works like a charm and was able to cut it easily to fit flush. Thank you!"
1,Useless,These are so magnetically weak that they didn't work at all for me. They're don't have enough power to stay on the vent.
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY,"i am very grateful to all of you who took the time to write a review. Like yourselves, I thought the idea of the product was a really good one; unfortunately, the cheapness and ineffectiveness of the magnetic pull made this product absolutely useless. I am still looking for a similar, but effective, solution."
2,Marginal Product,I was disappointed in the magnetism of the product. It did not stick well to overhead vents.
1,Don't Stick to Vent Cover,Magnetic properties are on the very light side. They didn't stick to my vents so I threw them away. Total waste of money.
2,Not So good,The magnetic covers seem to always fall off. I still have to try closing vents to ensure the air does not blow off the cover. I guess I was expecting a little to much for such a low price.
3,Weak magnet but works ok,"If you're laying these on vents on the floor they work ok, but don't expect them to stick to a ceiling vent or anything off the ground. They curl up a little as well so be sure the overlap the vent area"
1,"Worthless, even on floor mounted forced air vents","I can certainly understand the complaints from people that tried to use these on forced air vents that were not floor mounted. Since my vents were on the floor I figured they must at least work for my situation. Why else would they even bother to sell them, right? But as soon as the heat came on, the stupid things became airborne and flew right off the vent. Magnetically speaking these things are totally worthless, and I'm back to using old phone books to stop my guest room from stealing too much expensive heat. I can't imagine what these are supposed to be good for."
3,Not very strong,The strength of the magnets are no very strong. I would've given this product two stars had I needed these to cover a vent on the wall. Fortunately mine was on the floor.
1,The other reviewers were right!!!!!,The covers have very little magnestism. Don't buy this product if you will need to rely on it in an elevated area!!
1,Poor Quality Magnets - not sure worth the money,The magnet barely holds to the vent. Their must be a better solution. I wonder if the magnetic signs used on cars would work better (cut a piece to fit the vent). I won't buy these again.
2,Magnetic capibility is near zero,Just the force of air from the furnace will blow these covers off. I bought them because my vents wouldn't close all the way..just a waste of money
1,Waste of money,"I was a little concerned about trying this product since a few people who rated it noted that it was not powerful enough to actually stick to the register when it was blowing, but I opted to give it a try anyway. Everything they said is absolutely true. The first time the air actually cam on, it blew completely off. I've resorted to using packing tape to seal it over the register as a temporary fix until I can find another solution that isn't as flimsy. Definitely a waste of money for me."
2,"Heat yes, but melt no.",Got the product promptly. Placed one of the covers over the top half of one of the 2 hot air vents. Ran the heater off an on for several hours as usual. Got a little more hot air into the living room (as opposed to the hall) just as hoped for. But the next morning I noticed about an inch and a half of one corner of the new vent cover had curled up. These things are way too flimsy. Maybe if your hot air isn't very hot (has a longer run through the house before getting to the vent - mine is only about a 3 foot run) this could be for you. But I am disappointed.
2,An Adequate Introduction but Lacks Depth,"I was really dissapointed in this book. Kaplan provided its usual engaging and well-organized style to the book; however, the book really lacked the information I was wanting. Most of the information covered in the book is pretty basic for anyone has entered an undergraduate college in the past 7 years. The example personal statements are awful. The critiques of the essays are shortsighted and overlook rather large errors. The book is commendable though on how it provides specifis chapters for certain professions (ie. social work) and students with special needs. Nonetheless, the book did not even mention my area of interest (religious studies). If you're entering graduate school after a long break from undergraduate study, the book provides an adequate introduction to graduate school. The remainder of us should look for a book with greater detail."
5,A great insight into the mind of the Gordon Setter,"After being owned by a Gordon for seven years and now re-reading the book, it is obvious how well the Sorbys know these dogs. They have great insight into the inner workings of the mind of the Gordon in how the dog deals with other dogs, training, field and confirmation competitions. I do not hunt but these are great dogs and the book is as close to an owner's manual as you can get. I wish children came with a book like this."
3,"It's Ok, but.......","Remember, this book is written by one of the biggest breeders of Gordon Setters in the USA. That said, the book does have a number of valid points it makes, but then sometimes you have to wade through the propaganda.That said, it's an interesting read and if you are a student of the Gordon Setter breed, it does belong on your bookshelf."
2,Peu de personnalité,"Version de 1970 en cinq actes de 3 heures et demie avec Domingo et Caballé. Heureusement Domingo est encore jeune (30 ans) mais son interprétation est déjà routinière. Raimondi rate Philippe II et Giulini n'est pas à la hauteur de son enregistrement en public à Covent Garden en 1958. L'interprétation de Caballé est impersonnelle mais il est vrai aussi que le rle d'Élisabeth est souvent ingrat (on comprend que Crespin l'ait refusé à Karajan, dans une version très abrégée du rle il faut le dire)."
1,Rip Off,This CD is about 31 minutes long. 99% of that is relaxation and it only has about 4 affirmations on it. A pretty heafty price!
3,"Good, not great","After using Glenn Harrold's ""Lose Weight Now"" Hypnosis CD every night for several months, I was not impressed with Mesmer's. There was something about the pace and cadence of Mesmer's voice that didn't allow me to get into the flow of the hypnosis. Try Harrold's tape instead. Neither of them really tell you the logic of what you should eat and why so much as listening to the CDs leave that power of suggestion in your head so that you follow what you already know about proper nutrition. Harrold's voice really had a lasting, calming effect on my daily life in every minute of my day that Mesmer's didn't and it went far beyond the topic of weight loss. Try Harrold's ""Lose Weight Now"" it's like a long lasting non prescription Valium that helps destress you all day long. Hard to describe but one of the best things I ever did for myself. Mesmer's voice just doesn't do it for me like Harrold's voice--and yes, it helped me lose weight and no, I don't know why."
1,Ugh,Horrible book. Stories are predictable and dumb. I would recommend a student to watch tv over reading this book. Save your money...don't buy this book.
1,Where's The Original Versions?,"Boy was I ever disappointed when I opened this CD. Not one song on here was an original version of TG's great hits. While these cuts may be ""sonically superior"" having been recorded later, they just aren't the originals. What a shame the packaging didn't indicate that. My hopes of finding an all-inclusive CD of Sheppard's stuff -- dashed."
1,Fed up with *&^%$ Re-Records!!!,"T.G. You slime sucking pig!!!! How could you rip off unsuspecting fans with this bogus greatest hits collection. Even Johnny Lee wouldn't pull a stunt like this. This is bad for the entire country music industry. It makes me very hesitant to buy another C&W; cd. I'm on the lookout for rerecords and I still got duped. Why? Because you put the original recording dates next to the songs on the back of the CDs. And only in teeny, tiny type under it are the words: ALL SONGS NEWLY RECORDED. Well, I guess you and your record company, Goldmine are laughing all the way to the bank. ""Got us a little goldmine of ourselves, Haw. Haw Haw."" But here's the problem. You've lost the trust of all your fans. And the respect of all your peers. Oh, and The U.S. Attorney General will also be calling you shortly!This review was newly rewritten. And exclusive to this website."
4,A good collection,"Wow, what a rough crowd here! This is not a bad collection of T.G.'s stuff. And yes, they're re-done. But it states that clearly on the back of the CD insert. And the dates beside the song titles are the year they were on the Billboard chart, as stated above the song titles. No deception here, in my opinion."
1,zero stars zero value,"like previous reviewers, I was expecting the songs that I heard when they played on the radio. this album sounded like someones grandpa singing bad karaoke. I paid (...) for the album, but deleted it in its entirety after listening to only 2 of the many songs I love (in their original form). t g sheppard should be ashamed of himself for releasing this ear-offensive crap. I think the 5 star ratings on amazon were posted by t g sheppard or a cohort, probably conspiring to get fans to buy the crappy re-recording, then in disgust, buy the real thing and double their profit. not this time weasels, you disgust me too much. I will buy no t g sheppard recordings, good or bad in the future."
2,very disapointing not a fan of remakes,try as i might hard to find a tg shepherd greats hits cd that isn't a remake not a fan of any bodies remakes of their songs
2,Do not buy this version,"I was really psyched about getting this kung fu classic. I remember on the DVD Bruce Lee and Kung Fu Mania, this trailer was one of the best of all the trailers in the movie. You got a strong cast which includes David Chiang, Ti Lung, Chen Kuan Tai, Danny Lee, however the DVD itself is disappointing for as great as this movie is. You would think that Red Sun would provide a remastered version or at least a widescreen version of this movie. The fight scenes are great, however it hard to see most of them due to the screen format. This version makes Ground Zero look good and thats hard to do. Unless your a die hard shaw bros fan that has to have this movie regardless, then get this movie, if not then I would wait until Celestial Pictures provides a remastered version which you know has got to happen. This film is too good to go to waste."
2,Hit or miss,My cats won't eat these on a regular basis. Sometimes they gobble them up and other times they won't eat them at all. I would suggesting giving them before their main meal so they are hungry. I can't comment on the efficacy because they haven't used them on a regular basis.
1,Cat's won't eat them...,"This might be a great product...However, no one will ever know because no cat would ever eat these. They are huge brick tablets that smell like nothing. Cats are repulsed by them. Do not buy these. Waste of money."
3,"It works, I think, but the recent change is bad for humans.","The tablets are huge. The label recommends breaking them up into pieces before giving them to your cat. Why they can't just make them bite size to begin with? No clue. Anywho, my latest bottle came with an unwelcome surprise, they changed the shape. So, now instead of being a little smaller then like 3 nickels stacked on top of each other, it's now like 6 or 7 dimes. The result is that there is a lot less area for your fingers and it is a lot more dense. I struggle with it just about every time I have to break it up. Sometimes I just give up and not give it to them. This will be my last bottle unless it is changed."
4,This works for hairballs,"I do believe that this item helps with hairballs. I did not realize that it worked until I stopped using it. WHen I first purchased I used everyday. THen I stopped for a while and I noticed the hairball coughing returned. The bottle says break the item in smaller pieces. I found that crushing the pill and sprinkling it all over my cat's food ensures that he eats it all. Let me clearly explain, I open the bottle and place a pill inside the top. I use a teaspoon and break the pill in half then I turn the spoon upside down on the flat side and push it down and crush the entire pill. I turn the jar top around after I crush each section. Then I sprinkle the entire crushed pill over the food. Not in one spot but sprinkled over the entire can foor or even dry food."
5,Cat Hairball Tablets,"Love them! My cat loves them too! He considers it a ""treat"" when I give him one. I am very pleased with this product as I find it is difficult to get something for hairballs that my cat will actually eat. This is great for the ""picky"" cats of the world lol."
1,Must have changed the formula.,"I have been using these for about 6 months now and they had been working fine for my cat who wont eat anything but his cat food usually. However, the last two bottles we've purchased are no longer working and they feel much harder to break than previous pills purchased, even the cat has stopped eating them from noticing the difference."
3,"My cat loves these, but she still had hairballs","I had high hopes for this product after reading all the reviews. My long-haired cat has a problem with hairballs, despite frequent brushing. She went nuts for the taste of these tablets. I'd break each one into quarters and toss them around the room and she'd pounce and immediately eat them. What a yummy treat! We just finished the bottle and I was disappointed that the frequency of hairballs did not decrease. So I gave the product 3 stars based on how much my cat liked these, and I would have rated it a 5 if the hairballs had stopped. I guess they work for most cats, but mine must be the exception."
5,He likes it!,"Finally - something that our fussy, long-haired cat will eat! He hates to be brushed and I've tried a few different products to deal with the hairball issues. This one is a keeper as he actually likes it and I'm guessing it works as we haven't found any more coughed up hairballs. I just break the tablets into quarters and he thinks he's getting a treat! Nice & easy!"
2,YUKKY!,I bought this product after reading the reviews. It sounded like other people with very picky cats had great success with this. The only real gripes from other people was the size and shape making it difficult to break up. I didn't have much of an issue with that. I just put one in a ziploc bag and tapped it with the back of a spoon and got pieces small enough for my cat to swallow. I left some of them on the counter and stepped back to watch the magic. She sniffed it and RAN. Then I tried crushing it into a powder and added a small amount to her food. (about 1/10 of a pill)Would not touch her food. I left it there for hours before finally admitting defeat. I'm giving this stuff to a guy at work who has a cat with similar issues. I can't wait to see what his cat thinks about it.
3,cat loves these but they didn't seem to help,"Oh yeah, my cat loves the heck out of these. Unfortunately, they didn't help her hairball problem. Some people have had great results from this, so since it's not crazy expensive, I'd say give it a try. I'd hate to not recommend a product for an animal that might actually help it. For whatever reason, it just didn't work for my little Abigail. Time to take her back to the vet for futher evaluation."
2,It does not work for our cat,"Our cat has been having some digestive issues - mostly vomiting after meals. I really hoped this would work and alleviate the symptoms but instead, it gives her diarrhea. To make sure this was the cause, I stopped giving her this digestive aid and wait for her diarrhea to go away and then restarted it at half the recommended dosage. Quickly after, she again started to have diarrhea."
4,Cat loves to eat these!,When I gave them to the cat everyday(once or twice daily) he seemed to have an issue with getting sick but maybe it was something else at the time. We are trying them again but not everyday and it seems to work. He loves to eat them and will lick any fragment off the floor
5,My picky cat loves it - and no hairballs since,He looks for it in his food dish every day - he meows for it - and he hasn't had any fur balls since (he's a Persian)
5,Great solution to a messy problem.,"I have a medium-haired cat who was constantly coughing up hairballs. She also puked almost daily right after eating, which I assume was from the discomfort caused by the hairballs. I started giving her a tablet twice a day and noticed a change immediately. I wasn't cleaning up any messes! After a few days, she finally passed what I assume was her main problem: a giant hairball. I have reduced her to one tablet a day, and there are still no issues. I just ordered 2 more bottles!My cat also loves the taste of them. (They are liver flavored.) She gets excited when I pick up the jar. I would highly recommend these if you a having similar issues with your cat(s)."
1,What did they do?!,"Our cats used to love this, but they won't touch the latest bottle. They must have changed the formula or something. The old version used to work well at preventing hairballs, I'm not sure what the new version does, since the cats won't eat it. Searching again for a natural hairball remedy that appeals to cats and does the job."
3,The cat hates them but they seem to help,"My cat started to get hairballs rather suddenly. His condition was bad; they were actually obstructing his airway. Despite constant combing, he just kept getting them. I've tried a lot of these hairball aids and this one is his least favorite by far. The pills look like a large chewable vitamin. They are easily broken manually but it doesn't matter if they are whole or broken to pieces, my cat hates them. He eats around the pieces unless I submerge them in something tasty like tuna fish water. If they are not moistened, he will find them and eat around the pieces. The administration of this product does appear to be helping with his problem but the extra steps to get him to consume them are not what I would like to be doing with my time. I don't know if I will purchase them again. We'll see what alternatives I can identify in the upcoming weeks."
3,The most frustrating toy ever!!!!!!!!!!,"My little bro got this in the sales. The blade is simple to make, but the model is annoyingly hard to make. Bits keep falling off and took me about 1 hour for me to put it together with all of its pieces still attached.As for the blade, its rubbish. When I duel my bro with my Dranzer S and his Griffolion 2, I mash him every time. base has a plastic tip and makes the blade jump about (and usually out) of my arena (wok). My litle bro still uses Griffolion's attack ring, but still gets mashed by my Dranzer S."
2,I was disappointed,"Maybe I'm just too old for this book (it is rated for 9-12 year olds). There was a section that was so funny I had to stop reading long enough to catch my breath. But there is a lot of material that I can't see being intended as funny, it's just in there to be gross on purpose.The writing isn't great (though I might have over looked it when I was 9), incomplete characters, faulty forshadowing, unexplained/unexplored material.I'm not convinced the humorous material justifies reading the whole book. In fact, I recall wondering at points ""am I actually sitting here reading this?"" followed by wondering ""WHY am I reading this?"""
5,A very funny and very weird book.,"The weird Strega-Borgia family lives in their large (and very strange) home, known as StregaSchloss, in the Scottish Highlands. There's Titus, who's twelve and is obsessed with computers, his ten-year-old sister Pandora, who has a pet rat, and their baby sister Damp, who is... well, a baby. And of course their parents: their mom, a witch-in-training, and their father, currently in the captivity of his evil half-brother, as well as the cook (who actually can't cook for her life), the butler, and the nanny. Not to mention the various beasts and creatures that also make their home at StregaSchloss. Of course, the REAL trouble starts when Pandora dabbles in magic, shrinks Damp, and sends her over the Internet. This unusual, hilarious, and VERY WEIRD book is great for readers who like humorous fantasy books."
2,Clever and Emtpy,"The blurb enthuses, ""Harry Potter meets Lemony Snicket"" but should mourn, ""Disney meets Charles Adams... and wins.""A sheep in wolf's clothing: toothless, bland, and shamelessly derivative."
2,"Not funny, just pedestrian","I agree with the other reviewers here who found the book to be a hodgepodge of ideas, none of them explored adequately--or, for that matter, very interestingly. Based on some of the reviews I've read, I was expecting a book with clever ideas, or at least clever writing. Instead, I found a jumble of tired cliches, gaping plot holes, pedestrian writing, technological ignorance, and gratuitous potty humor. I'm not saying that this book won't appeal to 9-year-olds (I wasn't very discerning at that age either), but there are many better alternatives out there for this age group."
1,Pure Dead magic=Pfft.,"Well I must say, I disagree with others. In my opinion, this book is not THAT exciting.Quote in book-'Should Lemony Snicket grow abit stale, here's the perfect antidote.'False. Just plain,plain false. Pure Dead Magic is very confusing and makes no sense at ALL. Lemony Snicket should ""not"" grow 'stale'. To me, this book is always heading right away into the events instead of letting us grip onto the book harder and try to figure out what will happen next. I pity this book, why did I bother wasting money on this...? Anywoo, Lemony Snicket literally 'Owns' over Pure dead magic, really."
5,Magnifico!!!!,"Always when I listen to Ommadawn what comes to my mind is how Mike could do such a perfect album even knowing that he's a perfect musician. The first time I took Ommadawn in my hands it was long, long ago on a second hand record shop here in Rio. It was a brand new copy, and no scratches. Now on cd, it's better than never. If I had to talk more about Ommadawn, I would take many, many hours to describe how wonderful it is. Genius!!! A billion star rate."
4,A worthy effort...,"Mike Oldfield's music, at least in the ""Tubular Bells"", ""Ommadawn"", ""Hergest Ridge"" trilogy, consists of extended sonic landscapes. While not as consistently interesting as the music of Tangerine Dream or Jean-Michel Jarre, his compositions are pleasant enough.""Ommadawn"" is about as good as it gets. Part 1 is pure beauty, with smooth transitions from one musical theme to the next. The drumming at the conclusion of part 1 is particularly interesting.In part 2 it seems like Oldfield has run out of ideas, though the energy does build towards the end. And then there is the ""hidden"" track - the song ""On Horseback"". Short, and incredibly beautiful - and a fitting conclusion to a very good cd well worth owning."
4,The musical equivalent of astral projection,"In the 70s when it came out it seemed to resonate with cosmic beauty - now slightly less atavistic, but still has moments of pure illumination, fringed with greatness. It distilled the Zeitgeist of its era. Sat comfortably with Gawain and the Green Knight, Tao of Physics by Fritjof Capra, films by Fassbinder, Stan Brakhage, Nicholas Roeg, etc. (Even the pic of Oldfield on the front evokes Jesus Christ Superstar)I dock one star because Part II is simply not as good. My record was worn down listening to the magical Part I and the quintessentially English ""On Horseback.""""Et o, ces voix d'enfants, chantant dans la coupole!"" (thank you, TS Eliot)"
2,Yuk,"I can't imagine why I bought this. For over 30 years, Ommadawn has been one of my favourite albums by anyone ever. The remix is self-indulgent in the extreme and shows, yet again, why it's not a good idea to monkey with success. The ""lost version""...? Ho hum, really for completists only. Yes, it gives clear insight into the creation of the album but there's a shock waiting almost at every turn. Sorry, gang, but I wonder why this album was put out at all. Maybe I can't get out of the original mix enough to appreciate what Mike's done here but I don't want to. I love the album as was and this is not going to get a second hearing. It makes me wonder if Mike's well has started to dry up..."
3,TIDY. AND MEETS REQUIREMENTS,"The Cover on this item was inaccurately described.I would like to have been told of the frequent markings throughout.However, the book was well packaged and received at the exact estimated time.THANK YOU. :-)"
2,Mindnumbing,"From begining to end I really felt like this film could have been shot on an old hi-8 cam. Tom Berenger wasnt bad, but neither was he great.. and the rest of the supporting cast felt like half dead fish floundering onscreen for the duration of the film.. in point of fact I dont really think it was their fault..The script, or what their was of it was slow and meandering and never really did have much of a point. Even when Tom's character did some dispicable act, you neither felt shocked nor disgusted or disturbed, but instead it all seemed forced as if the writer could find no other way for the story to progress.Now on to the music, it had those cliche guitar riffs you would catch in a lot of the late 80s early 90s thriller type films, which would be fine.. if this film hadn't been made in 2001.The only real good thing I can say about this movie is that eventually it ends."
2,NICE TRY TOM,"Over the years, Tom Berenger has shown diversity in his projects, including such films as ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar,"" ""Platoon,"" ""Rustler's Rhapsody,"" and ""The Substitute."" However, in this muddled Canadian venture, Tom works hard to make the film work. While he is convincing in his role as serial killer Eddie, the rest of the cast and the plodding direction/screenplay make all his efforts pointless. Tygh Runyan as Mike is pitifully miscast and doesn't do anything to really make you feel for his character; Rachel Hayward does a little better, but we never really know what makes her tick and the ending is abysmally flat. There's little suspense, and that rests mainly on director's lap; moody scenes of the lighthouse and the bay can't compensate. Could have been and should have been better."
2,Muzak for the masses...not typical V.I.,"This cd was Steve Smith's venture into Rippingtons and Yellow Jackets territory, I guess looking for the bucks. This is not the Steve Smith fusion with an edge that you are familiar with. Unless you like smooth jazz, Stay away!"
5,great addition to your train table for a toddler,"If your toddler loves lights and noise, this is a great item to add to the Brio Fire Station. The fire truck included with that station does not come with the trailer with ladder and hose. My 2 yr old son loves to play with the fireman climbing the ladder, using the hose etc... Its noisy but not unbearable, and after about 6 months of play, i've not changed batteries or anything. And he likes having 2 firemen for the station too."
2,expensive plastic Brio made in China,"Looked better on the picture than in real. Note that this little toy is made of plastic, made in China (with Brio tag)...too expensive...this price would be adequate if it was made from real wood in Sweden. I was disappointed and returned the item. PS. I cannot judge how interesting/fun is light-and-sound feature because I did not open the package."
5,medium camera bag,I love the camera bag. It is light and fits actually two of my cameras plus their battery backups and wires to connect to PCs. It has lasted well and has the right sized pockets to carry all the accessories.
2,Manual won't fit,The bag should have been made large enough to hold the 740 manual without having to crunch it up and place it on the top.Disappointed.
2,"No sir, I do not like it","This bag is small! Kodak.com says it fits the P850. Barely! I have lenses, battery rechargers and an external flash. There is not enough room for everything. There are velcro strips on the inside of the bag that allow you to move the dividers around which are useless since you can't even move the dividers due to some kind of built-in loops for holding pens or pencils or something of the sort. If I were to put a writing utensil in the loops there would be even LESS room for a camera. My camera makes the dividers bulge outward leaving no room for the first and third compartments."
5,Great bag at a great price!,"This camera bag really can hold a lot. There are many different compartments and it is built of high quality material. As another said, it is almost too big, but I cannot complain. We feel confident enought to have our 6, 8, and 10 year old children carry it around at the airport and while we are out and about. We personally use this case for our Kodak EasyShare Z740, but we do carry many other items in the case. It is strong, very-well constructed, durable, and has lots of padding. Oh yeah, the best part is the price. I highly recommend this camera bag."
4,Nice but big.,I bought this for my old digital camera and now I don't use it anymore because it is so bulky to haul around and my new camera is smaller and works better and can fit in my purse.
2,Way to big,"This case is recomended for my z7590 but it is way to big, there is enough room in it for three digital cameras and accessories. I knew from experience that Kodak's small bags were to small so I thought this would be perfect but the camera is lost in there. I really don't have much else to carry, just the camera, charger and an extra battery so I am returning mine. I wanted a Kodak bag but they just don't make one the right size. If you dont mind lugging around a huge mostly empty bag or you have a lot of extra stuff, this bag is a good value and seems to be of high quality."
2,pretty lame,"This book I thought was dumbed down to the point of sad. All the info in it was, and should be, known by anyone remotely knowledgable about houses and handyman type work. It seems to have been written for the high school drop-out needing a direction. I would not recommend unless that person was completly clueless."
4,Handyman's Handbook,The book is written clear and down-to-earth.It is being very helpful.It arrived in brand new condition even though I expected it to be used-I was pleasantly surprised.My only small complaint is that I didn't find anywhere the author mentioning liability insurance as may be needed for this line of business.Thank you.
4,Retired Handyman,This is an excellent book for anyone interested in starting a new career.Has lots of helpful hints and tips for both the beginner and those with some experience.
4,A TRULY ENLIGHTENING BOOK,"The book, HARRIS AND ME, by Gary Paulsen is a cheerful and exciting book. Reading this book will bring back memories of days you have lived during the summer. You will find yourself saying, ""I can relate to that"", over and over again. The two boys in this book do everything from catching mice, to making their own speeding bike, to falling in love. One of the characters, Harris, is like the trouble making boy at school that we all know. He is always scheming plots to try to do something exciting. The main character, whose name is never told to you, is a shy boy who is forced to live with an aunt, uncle and cousins while his parents are in rehab due to alcohol. While he is at his uncle's farm, the narrator forms a special bond with his cousin Harris. The overall mood of this book is very funny and happy. This is a must read for people who like comedy and all around happy books."
5,Another Hit From Gary,"This book is great! If you like to laugh this book is foy you. This book has such interesting situations such as wrestling pigs, getting attacked by a crazy rooster named Ernie, and many more. This book is funny for the young and young at heart. It should only be read by people who are ten or over. The only sad chapter is the last one because you never want the book to end."
4,"A Little Bit of This, A Little Bit of That","I would give the book HARRIS AND ME by Gary Paulsen, three and a half out of five stars. This book was sometimes hilarious, and sometimes a little unexciting. It was about a boy (whose name is never mentioned) who went to live with his distant relatives, the Larsons. The narrator then met up with his crazy and wild cousin Harris. Harris is very mischievous and sneaky. He likes to try anything, even if it means winding him up in trouble. This includes jumping on sows, jumping on horses' backs, swinging like Tarzan, riding a horse and shooting at things like Jean Autry, and even losing his pants! At first, the days with Harris were long and tough, but then the narrator got used to it and had a good time with Harris. ..."
3,Harris and me,"The book, HARRIS AND ME is a adventurous but funny book.You will love the characters.If you like books with characters who are daring, you will love Harris.If you like to read funny books, you should read HARRIS AND ME.It is funny becasue Harris is always getting in trouble and always getting hit for swearing.You have yo read this book because Harris does everything from acting like tarzan to burning his business.HARRIS AND ME is a hilarious book you must read."
5,This is a surpisingly good book!,Here are a list of pro's and con's about this book.Pro: 1.It's entertaining 2.It's unpredictable 3.It's humorous 4.It's suspenseful 5.It's EBS book at my schoolCon: 1.It was too long 2.It had an unoriginal plot 3.It needed more pictures 4.The kid had to leave at the end of the book 5.Some parts were confusing
3,Zac's Review,"Harris and MeBy Gary PaulsenThe book Harris and Me by Gary Paulsen is a memoir about Paulsen going to live with his cousin, Harris, the summer he is 12 years old because his parents are alcoholics. The story is about all the things he does in his best summer ever. The boys have many crazy adventures with not as many consequences.The book is a hilarious comedy about boys being boys. For example, they go out one day Gary Paulsen dares Harris to pee on an electric fence. The things that they think of will keep the reader on his or her toes. The book is best for middle school students and up."
4,HARRIS AND ME,"HARRIS AND ME must have been one of the greatest books I have ever read. It was a great humorous novel and also adventurous. The narrator moved to his second cousin's farm for the summer. On acount of his parents being ''pukedrunks'', as Harris would say. Harris and the narrater went on manny adventures from getting their business frieded to jumping off of graniry roofs. This is a great book for the adventurous people and for others who just want a good laugh."
4,Harris and me,"This book, Harris and me, was an interesting book because the author gave you facts on how to act in real life if you needed them. For example, one fact he gave is that he supports with words that make you keep on reading. Who ever reads this book will love it; it will make you read more of his books. He wrote this one that was amazing. he also wrote several other books like Hatchet, Dogsong, and many more. Check it out; it is cool!"
4,Nothin' Like a Big Heap of Country Lovin',"Harris and Me is a funny country tale of two cousins sharing an amazing summer on the farm. By the end of the story, Gary Paulsen has pulled the reader into the story by feeling the emotions of the characters, laughing there laugh, and crying there cry. Harris and the narrator experienced many adventures on the farm, like falling in love(and learning payback is the best),playing Tarzan, burning his business and being attacked by a crazed rooster named Ernie. I would reccomend this book to any reader ages 10 to 13;it was an excellant read and one of my favorites."
4,So Close Yet So Far,"HARRIS AND ME was a funny and emotional novel about a boy who moves in with his relatives because his parents were alchoholics. The one boy that the narrator really meshed with was Harris, the youngest and the most trouble in the Larkin family. Just one of the examples of a crazy situation Harris got himself into was peeing on the electric fence and ""burning his buisness"". Together the 2 boys had many experiences and adventures and they learned that friendship is the best thing anyone could ever have. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read of funny adventures and who likes to just have a laugh once in a while."
4,A GREAT SUMMER,"i thought that the book HARRIS AND ME was okay. It was about a boy(the narrator) who was Harris' cousin, who came over for the summer. The book could have been a bit better, like Gary Paulsens other books. I also thought the book was a bit funny because of the part where they broke the gun and Harris did it, but the narrator got blamed for it. I also thought the book was a bit boring because they did stupid things, like jump off the top of the barn onto the horses. That's what I thought of the book HARRIS AND ME."
3,Not Good Enough,"HARRIS AND ME was a good book, but wasn't a great one. I didn't like all of the characters, especially Harris. Harris is always getting the narrator into trouble and uses profane(bad)language. Harris is punished for his language by a nice slap onthe head. The is funny but has way too much things going on. There are only a few parts of the book don't have something going on and those parts are very boring. The narrator seems to be one of the few sane people in the book. Its about a boy who is sent to the country for the summer. He and his cousin get into trouble a lot. Harris is always making up games to play ... I liked the book but at some parts didn't like it at all."
3,Harris And Me,"HARRIS AND ME was a good book but it wasn't the best. It is about a boy who goes to live with his second cousins on a farm because his parents can't take care of him. It tells about his adventures on the Larsons' farm. The narrator is sure to have the best summer of his life with his loud and humorous cousin Harris, his silent Uncle Newt , and Louie, a mysterious old man who lives on the farm. Some parts of this book were funny but it isn't a book I would recommend because I didn't really like the ending."
3,Harris and Me,"This book was very funny, and I didn't expect it to be. Harris is so funny with all the stupid and risky things he does!"
4,Harris And Me,"The book, HARRIS AND ME, by Gary Paulson was a very good book; not average because of some good qualities of this book. Basically, the narrator was dropped off at his cousin's farm, and spends the summer there. To be honest, the reason this book recived four stars from me, and not five, is because some parts of the book is not clear to me, like when they go chase mice with a gun. Everthing else, put into mind, it is a very good, and well written book."
4,Harris And Me,"HARRIS AND ME, in my opinion was a good book. This book was about a boy named Harris and another boy whose name is not mentioned throughout the book. He is the narrator of the story.I felt this book was fairly entertaining and humorous. Harris's personality was out of this world crazy. He was up to doing anything spontanous if he got something in return. But most of the things he just did on his own. I gave this book a four because there were some chaprters that just went on forever about the same thing. Wrapping it up, this book was about a boy spending his vacation with his family and everyday being an adventure. If you enjoy funny books, HARRIS AND ME may be for you."
4,Harris And Me,"Harris and me is the most funny,action book I ever heard.It shows the narrator it won't be easy living at a farm.Without realizing,for the first step outside of the house at the farm.You'll get dirty easily.It shows the narrator sliding in mud,with pig poop.The other character that was funny is Harris.Harris is aperson who gets hurt.For one,Every time Harris swears he'll just get smacked over the head by clence.The one that Harris got hurt the most was when he jumped off the barn, landed on the rear of the horse on his groin.It hurts so much,Harris got up while holding his groin and al of a sudden the horse kicks him into the barn.Another most pain ful thing Harris got into is when he peed on an eletrical fence and got shocked just for two pictures.If u want to know more than read this book."
4,funny book,"I recommend the book Harris and me because,it seems to be a very good book the characters seem to be fairly funny like when Harris and the narrator swung from the hay loft and flogged by Ernie then landing in the pig pen. And when Harris and the narrator took the motor off the washing machine and put it on the bike and started the bike by pushing it. Then the bike drove down the driveway going faster and faster theninto a pile of brushripping off Harris's overalls I found that kind of funny."
5,Greatest book ever,"Humans of all ages should read this book. You will laugh AND cry until you fall off the couch! I know, I've seen me do it!"
5,worth every nickel,"this delightful book makes a difference -- laughter in the face of overwhelming odds is theraputic. to survive harris's escapades, our hero, also a survivor, observes, caves in, runs screaming from the play space ... as an adult, this is a go-to book for times of depression. and if you like this, try paulson's iditerod book."
4,Funny and Sad,"I reccomend this book because it's very funny and interesting, I think anyone would like this book.At first the narrato dosn't like it on the farm where he spent his summer with Harris because they had to do a lot of work, and when he got hit by the cow Vivian, but time passed and it became fun for him.When he had to go home Harri didn't want him to leave and started crying and so did the narrator."
4,FULL OF MISCHIEF,"HARRIS AND ME is a wonderful story about a boy who moves around from family to family every summer. This time he moves to his cousins house where alot of weird things happen to him. Harris is the boys cousin who lives on a farm. On the farm you meet some weird charecters just like Harris. Harris is full of mischief and is always saying bad words that makes his older sister Glenus hit him. Plus, he always has some kind of plan to get himself and the narrator into big trouble. Whether it's jumping off a loft onto a gigantic horse or attatching a washing machine motor to a bike and loosing control and having his bibs fly off, Harris will always think of something to do, that will keep the readers of this book entertained."
3,Laughs and Adventures,"HARRIS AND ME was a good book for all readers. It was funny, adventurous, emotional, and daring. Harris and the narrator get into a lot of trouble. They acted out scenes from the Jean Autry movie, caught mice, had wars with a cranky rooster, and wrestled Commie jap pigs. Sometimes they would just relax and try to get some food before Louie ate it. At the end, every reader saw a side of Harris that they never saw before. I recommend this book to all readers, if you want to have a good laugh, or you just want to get into the adventures of Harris and the narrator."
2,ZZZZZZZ,Harris and Me is a great story about a boy that temporarily moves to his cousin's house on a farm because his parent's are alcoholics. The boy has to figure out all of the mean tricks that Harris plays so he doesn't fall into his traps. I liked the parts when Harris plays jokes and then the boy becomes upset. I think that Gary Paulson is too description about the nasty things and uses too many swear words. I think that boy's in 3rd grade till 5th grade will really enjoy reading this story.
4,Harris and Me- a fantastic quick read choice,"Wildly imaginations of Harris, the main character's cousin, can create a mess. But with Harris, everything is fun; starting from playing comme jap to writing a bike with a motor on, life in the countryside is full of excitements. Because of Harris' rude and violent use of language, the house is never settled, but the main character spends a great time at his cousin's house during the summer.I recommend this book to probably a boy, even though I am girl, since it deals with some ""harsh"" languages such as swearing. I would think it's about the right level for 5-7th graders :) enjoy!"
4,Funny and Interesting,"HARRIS AND ME was a really interesting book. I thought it was funny. The end of the book was excellent. It showed Harris had feelings. Harris usually is the tough guy that you would never think would show emotion. One of the parts that I found pretty interesting and funny was the part where Harris and the narrator were trying to be like Tarzan. They were trying to aim in the barn but they missed and landed in the mud with the pigs. Harris and the narrator had some really fun and good times, but on the other hand there were times when they didn't have fun. Thats the whole meaning of friendship. With friendship, you can have ups and downs, but you will always be friends. The author made me feel like I was there in the book the whole time. I didn't want my teacher to stop reading it. I feel that if your interested in funny and friendship books, then you should read HARRIS AND ME."
5,Great Book,"This book is just plain funny. This is written by Gary Paulsen so you know it's great.If you live on a farm or ranch, don't get any ideas from the story. Once you reat it you'll know why.My recomendation is to read it and read it again. It never gets old. This is one of the BEST books I have ever read!!!"
4,Harris and Me,I thought that the book was great. I guess that the main reason why I liked it so much was because I live on a farm out in the country and it relates to me in many ways. Alot of the mischievious things that harris did were things that I did too. I think that anyone out there that lives on a farm will love this book. The book was written by Gary Paulson. So all in all I would recomend this book.
3,Good product,"This is a good product but the supplied attachment to the dryer and vent need mods. to work. Had to tape it down to get to stay secure, it kept falling off with the supplied attachments."
3,Stinks,"This beyblade stinks.I blew it in half with my Metal Draciel.The bladebase is weak,the weight disk is too light, and the rollers on the attack ring rarely help.Overall,Its a 3/10 for me."
3,...,THIS BEYBLADE IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY! This beyblade is lightweight....I blew the attack ring in half and split the bladebase in two with my Metal Draciel. DO NPT BUY THIS BLADE
4,Roller defenser thwarts attacks,"This was the second beyblade I had ever purchased. It was a good choice to purchase this incredible blade. It has a spin time of two minutes and twenty seconds with a short rip cord. It has defeated several good blades thanks to its great defense and endurance. This blade has beaten a wyborg, dragoon storm, draciel fortress, and even a driger f. This blade has never fallen apart in the heat of battle and rarely lets me down. Once it gets stuck in the pockets, though, it can mean the end of the match in a failure. Overall, this blade is worth the money and is a great beyblade for beginners."
3,its decent....,roller defenser was the third blade i got. its OK but the plastic does not seem to be as strong as alot of my other beyblades. after the first fight i had stress marks on the plastic. After like 1 week of battling with it the stupid gimicky roller things both busted off. For the most part it sucks.
5,Great Zombie attack ring,"This blade may look bad, but its attack ring is essential for a good zombie blade! All you need is a free spinning base and a 8 wide weight disk and you have a great blade. Zombie blades are some of the strongest blades there are."
3,Not the best,"Joseph T. Robinson had an interesting career, being elected to Congress in 1902, elected Governor of Arkansas in 1912, in 1913 elected by the Legislature to succeed Jeff Davis (who is the subject of a really outstanding biography: The Wild Ass of the Ozarks: Jeff Davis and the Wocial Basis of Southern Politics, by Raymond Arsenault), and served in the Senate till his sudden death on July 14, 1937, having been the vice-presidential candidate on Al Smith's ticket in 1928. While the early chapters of this book, telling of Robinson's early years and his rise in Arkansas politics are interesting, the account of his Senate years is pedestrian and uninterestingly written. The author has a superficial grasp of the times in which Robinson lived, and while the book is well-footnoted and has a good bibliography, the book is actually a published thesis and was a disappointment to me. I have read a lot of senatorial biographies and must rate this one of the poorer ones."
1,Not to Waste It On this Book,"This was my first,unfortunatly, book on procrastination, and absolutly the worst book on the subject. How simplistic to divide procrastination into six personality styles! Don't try to pigonhole yourself with silly labels! Offers very little reletively to other books on the subject, which can suggest many rich, insightful and even clever ways on becoming productive. Good news is - the only way is up."
5,A Gift of Time!,"As a lifelong procrastinator on her way down the hill, I have read MANY books on this subject as I try to conquer my problem. This book is the best for me. Others who criticize the categorization may not realize that no one fits into one niche. Because I fit into three categories, I do the exercises for all of them. The visualization exercises are so powerful they bring me to tears! I don't understand why, as they are abstract, but my reaction tells me they are hitting the mark.I have improved my productivity greatly by DOING the exercises in this book. For me, learning the causes behind my behavior helped me to make better use of my time, most days now! For the rest of them, I have learned to be more forgiving and not become frozen in the self-blame and guilt that contribute to the problem. Each day is not just another day to put things off, but another day to try again!"
4,Easy to read and understand.,Straight forward look at diff. procrastination styles. The key to solving a problem is to understand the problem and this book does a thorough job towards understanding the problem of procrastination. Bottom line- it helped me.
4,"The dark and unknown world of procrastination, revealed.","I believe Dr. Sapadin does an excellant job of explaining and bringing to light the world of procrastinators. I feel this book is of good quality, but in my case, it did not help me to overcome my own problem of procratination. She tells many stories of successes, but for me, it wasn't even close to a tie. In all, Dr. Sapadin presents this book in an excellant manner and shows the utmost knowledge and understanding of the subject. For others, this book may be a great help of which one has a risk they can not afford not to take in reading this book."
1,You're better off with a knife,"This product is horrible as it always gets stuck in the middle of the rind. At least the seeder works for getting the seeds from the center of the fruit, but you may as well save your money and use a regular spoon!"
3,This book's authenticity is in question.,"Take a look at the Portland newspaper, The Oregonian, for January 6, 2002. An article recommending Opal to Northwestern readers also questions the authenticity of the allegedly precocious young Opal. Apparently, she turned up in Los Angeles without a diary or notes; two years later, a box of diary notes with a surprisingly literary, sophisticated mentality arrived at the publisher's. So: the book may be good, but it may have been written by the adult Opal as she was on the verge of mental illness."
3,Not the original,It is important to understand that this is an adaptation. It is not identical with the original text published in 1920. This version has been abbreviated and rearranged.
3,Look before you buy,"I'm not sure what I expected, but I was certainly glad I didn'tbuy it.'Pause' takes several commercials and displays roughly16-20 frames of each one. The advantage is that most of thesecommercials aren't available to one audience (the USA, for example).Yes, it's a neat looking, well-designed, oversized thing to hold.There WERE some inspiring things in there. However, in my opinionit's NOT a $35 dollar book. It makes a nice first impression, but inthe end it felt like a very high-end, $20 design industry magazine.It should have been priced as such."
2,"Cool idea, insufficient execution",This should have been a CD-ROM or DVD product. The stills did nothing to inspire or educate me on motion graphic techniques. Nice philosophic text though.
1,I wish I didn't buy this book.,"I had bought this book because it was ""Required Reading"" for one of my classes in art college. Not worth buying. Each page features storyboards of various motion graphics commercials/video art (and not even the best motion graphics at that). If I could return it, I'd return it right away. If you're an art student and you're a motion graphics art student, and you're required to buy this book for class, please don't waste your money. You are better off reviewing reels of commercials on company websites and learning from them. The choices of work in this particular book are terrible. The art/color is very mediocre and most seemed to have been released in the 1990's. Much of commercials/motion graphics nowadays are very sophisticated and artsy. You'd learn a lot more by watching the commercials on t.v.If you are a student, please save your money for your bus fare/train commuting, or better yet save it as lunch money."
4,Good Service,"Just purchased this June 2012. Arrived from Amazon in 1 day. Even though the instructions say the default configuration is set up for right tilting saws, the fence was actually attached to the sled for a left - which is what I have.Instructions for assembly set up are very detailed and I got the unit set up with no problem. When I went to use the Shop Stop I found it was missing the locking rail that enables it to be clamped to the fence. I emailed ""Linda"" per the Incra web site on Sunday, she responsed on Monday and I had the part by Friday.So, even though the part was missing, service was very responsive and I am satisfied with the performance of the product. I especially like the extra long fence.I personally find the length measurement on the fence (which was set up for a right-tilt) to be hard to use, and don't plan to try to use this feature. For that I give it 4 stars."
5,Awesome miter gauge / sled,"This unit is awesome! It has an adjustable miter slide so it has no slop (I extended the fence out to 60"" to check the side to side play and it was tight and true), a long fence and extension (64 + inches), adjustable miter slides, flip stop and a very precise miter guage. Spend some time with the initial calibration of 90 degrees and you are golden from there on. It is well made and engineered. Although it is not inexpensive, if you want accuracy, you have to pay for it. The instructions are very simple to follow and accurate set up is 30 minutes or so. I have never gotten good results from miter gauges so I have built cross cut sleds to achieve my goals. However, they did not acheive all that this sled provides. Incra is known for their accuracy and quality and this unit is all that and more.Even given the price I paid, I still award it 5 stars. If you want dead on repeatable accuracy, this is it."
3,Two guys and a girl,"This book was easy to read. This book is so typical in the life of a fith grader. The plot is two boys like the same girl and the main character,in this case Simon, always gets the girl. It was love at first sight for Simon. He had to work hard to get her. He lost his B.F. (best friend) in the process."
3,Cybil War Review,"This story is about Simon and Tony fighting over a girl named Cybil. The main characters are Cybil, Tony, and Simon. The story takes place in Simon's home town in present day. Simon and Tony are best friends. Simon has been in love with a girl named Cybil for 3 years. Then Tony decides he loves Cybil so Tony tries to get Cybil to hate Simon. Simon finds this out and prevents her from hating him. Read this book to see who gets Cybil.I think this story is funny when Tony said his grandma told him his brother`s small shoes were magic shoes. It was also funny when Tony said Simon had to go out with a fat girl named Harriet Haywood. It is also funny when Simon was bragging that he won the war for Cybil. That's why this book is funny."
4,the cybil war,i read this book in grade school. it was good and i ordered it have passed it onto my nieces they liked it very much.
4,The Cybil War Review,"In The Cybil War Tony and Simon are fighting over Cybil. The story takes place in their home town in modern days.In The Cybil War two guys , Tony and Simon, fight over a pretty girl called Cybil . Their war travels between places. Simon doesn't realize that Cybil hates Tony but likes him. In the end Simon wins The Cybil War.I really enjoyed reading this book because the characters are great and it had a very detailed beginning middle and ending. I thought that a lot of the scenes were funny like the pet show. I thought some of Tony lies were mean but some of the others were funny. I hope I can read more great books like The Cybil War."
2,Plotless and predictable,"This book has NO plot! if you like predictable books, you'll love this book! two boy like this one girl, of course, they try to impress her, and of course the main character gets her.Duh. This book is really boring."
2,Has problems.,"The headphones & wireless operation work well for what I do with my iPod, which is essentially listening to Podcasts. The weak link in the chain is with the transmitter that plugs into the headphone jack of the iPod and sends the signal to the headphones. Presumably, trying to make the on/off switch on the transmitter ""pretty,"" they have designed it as a plastic circle that you have to twist to turn on and off (turning it off so you don't have to charge it all the time), the problem is that it is hard to turn, sometimes I can't turn it off or on. A simple switch on the side would have prevented all these issues, but alas we are stuck with this poor design (in the transmitter) of what is otherwise a great, functional product."
1,Lasted about one year,It was good while it lasted. After one year the battery would not charge anymore and Plantronics offered to fix it or replace it for about $100.The item is in great condition but does not charge anymore and Plantronics basically does not want anything to do with it.
5,I like the Otis Cleaning System,Works great and fits well. Does a nice job cleaning and clears the bolt without having to tear down the weapon
3,This Little Pigg Hand Puppet Board Book,This book was much smaller than I had anticipated. Hopefully my grandaughter will enjoy as it is one of her Christmas gifts.
5,I am pleased with these binoculars.,These binoculars are good for out door use qand bird watching. I have no qualms with these.
3,A decent little pair,"These are a decent little pair of binoculars. The light gathering power is not enormous, but I was able to see night sky objects well, andromeda galaxy and the Pleiades star cluster looked nice. They fold up and are fairly compact. Good for daylight viewing and bird watching, not the best out there, but good for being very inexpensive."
2,At infinity it is soft,"This is good for close range in bright day light , however its very dim even before dark and with long distances , may be more than 3 to 4 hundred meters it is soft and your eyes will cause you a headache ."
4,Pretty good for the price.,"It had a bunch of goop on the lenses, silicon or something... It was a pain to get it all off without using something like rubbing alcohol. Once I got them cleaned up, they give clear and crisp images."
5,Great binocular for the price,I purchased the binocular for our recent trip to Alaska. The clarity and ease of operation are fairly good considering the price.
4,Good product good price,This is a good little binocular for carrying in the car or in your pocket when out in nature. Good clear image. Great price.
1,"Reflections, haze around edges","I regret taking these along on a trip. White reflections, especially on the right side, block the image and I also see a haze around the edges which further limits the view. Highly annoying to try to see the image past these shortcomings, even at the ten dollar price I paid. As far as I am concerned they are useless at this point. Only one star for the case, which I'll be able to use either for the pair that I hope to find to replace these or for my GPS unit.I purchased these from a local retailer based on my good experience with the Celestron 15x70 binoculars thinking this might also be a good pair in this category at a good price."
5,Hispanics/Latinos in the United States: Rev. by Thomas Cox,"The essays collected in this volume represent the efforts of a varied and interdisciplinary group of scholars to come to grips with some of these pressing issues of identity, ethnicity, race, and rights. The questions arising from identity have major implications not just for Hispanics/Latinos but also for all citizens...For those serious students of these issues, this volume will be an extraordinary catalyst for future discussions and practical guidelines for implementation."
