5,Someone is slamming this book for unjust cause,"I just read a bunch of bad reviews on this book. I find it funny that all of a sudden this book has gotten bad reviews after receiving hundreds of top reviews. Someone is slamming this book and having others help do the same for some unknown reason. This is absolutely one of the most terrifying books on paranormal activity that has ever been written. If the book is so bad why has it been the topic of TV shows such as Geraldo, Sally Jessee Rapheal, Sightings, Encounters, Real Ghosts, Discovery TV, National Geographic, The Other Side, A Current Affair and many many more? Sounds like someone either has a grudge against the author or Bobby Mackey. If you want to be scared read this book alone at night and then you be the judge- Amityville would take a back seat to this book becasue this story is true."
3,GOOD STORY...BAD WRITING,The story is a fairly good one if you're interested in supernatural phenomenon. Parts of the book are truly scary in spite of Mr. Hensley's inability to write. Mr. Hensley's writing skills are abysmal at best. The fact that I actually finished the book is testament to the fact that the book can be chilling at times. It's unfortunate that the book wasn't authored by an actual writer...that might have made for a really good book. It doesn't appear that the book was proof read for errors. There are repetitions and word errors. The book is definitely not worth the listed purchase price but if you can pick up a second hand copy for less you'll probably get some thrills and not regret your purchase.
3,True or False?,Is this for real?Parts of this book seemed to have been made up.I first saw this story on TV on a show about ghost so I was really looking forward to reading the book. And the book starts off really good and parts I think are true but the more you read it just seems as if people are adding on to the story and it starts to make you wonder if these things really happaned as these people say.Things fly across the room'ghost talk to people'Not a bad read for someone who wants to read a ghost story.But is it true or false you be the judge.
4,Scary and Hard to Put Down,"This book was great. I have always been fascinated by ghosts and especially the haunting of this local bar. At first the story seemed unreal. But, the author thought so to at first. He did a great job of research. He lists everything in a chronilogical order, which helped me keep track as the events unfolded. There is also a nice appendix of affidavits, pictures, references to support the history, and a bar layout map. This book kept me thinking about it long after I put it down. I had trouble sleeping the first night after replaying it in my mind. There is another version of this book at the Kenton County Library, Covington. It appears to be a homemade copy and wasn't published. I believe the author wrote it before finding a publisher. It isn't the same as this book. It is the same story but the chapters don't match up to this book. I plan on checking it out next. It is titled ""Terror at Music World"""
5,"Corroded acidhead, now bald and beat up, sez AoxomoxoA best","This is the album that got me hooked on the dead. Before this, I didnt get it. But I smoked a joint, put on the headphones and got BLASTED listening to Tubs' sizzlin' slide guitar on Cosmic Charlie. Yeow, right up and down the spine! And the ominous, unstoppable Saint Stephen, far better that the muddy live version on Live Dead. It is sparkly and scary! And Mountains of the Moon. Ah, just great music, and it still sounds good. Fun stuff, full of life and possibilities. I used to love the Dead. At least until they got Keith and Donna Godcheaux - the piano player and his wife. But that's another story. Hey, anybody got a joint?"
4,Too tame,"At the time of recording this album, the Dead played live with fiery abandon. They seemed to approach the studio like a toy they couldn't quite get to work. A very young Courtney Love appears in the back cover photo."
4,An underated gem.,"Considering this album was released in '69, some of the music seems incredible even now. This album features the most amazing song ever recorded by the Dead: China Cat Sunflower. This song will blow your mind away- it's that good. Cosmic Charlie and St. Stephen also are played well. The only disappointments on the album are Rosemary and What's Become of the Baby (which gets my nod for worst Dead song of all time). Worth picking up for China Cat Sunflower alone."
4,My fav Grateful Dead Studio CD,Aoxomoxoa (can't pronounce it) is a very spacy CD with beautiful acoustic moments and some trippy stuff as well.There is a different mix (original 1969 release)of the album much prefered by Dead Heads but this is all there is on CD at this stage.A good way to get introduced into the Grateful Dead is getting this CD.
4,A Must-Own for Dead Afficianados,"The real highlight of this remaster for Deadheads, other than the improved sound, is the added tracks. ""Clementine Jam,"" ""Nobody's Spoonful Jam,"" and ""The Eleven Jam"" are nearly as much fun as the rest of the album, which contains such Dead live staples as ""St. Stephen"" and ""China Cat Sunflower."" All of the bonus stuff was recorded live in the studio, except for ""Cosmic Charlie,"" which was recorded live in San Francisco on 1/25/69. The expanded booklet and liner notes are great, too. A must-have."
1,"Shoulda called this one ""THE WORST OF...""","When I listen to Aoxomoxoa, I immediately smell fish. Tuna, to be specific. When I first heard this, way back when, my first wife (#1 of 4) was eating a tunafish sandwich. When I hear it now, I want to vomit. Just horrible."
1,Warning to casual or unexperience fans,"I'll keep this short. In the world of Grateful Dead music offerings, this is one of the worst. Basically all studio recordings by this band suck compared to live recordings. This is a live band! Buy Live Music! Unless you are a completist, you do not need this record. There are plenty of stellar live recordings of most of the songs on this . Buy Live Grateful Dead Music.P.S.- I am not kidding. Buy Live!"
1,Yuck!,"I had a roommate in college who claimed that the Dead always sounded better live than they did on their studio albmus. He literally had briefcases full of bootleg tapes of Dead concerts and played them over and over and over again.Well, I've heard this studio album, and having heard recordings of the Dead's live concerts, I can say that it makes no difference. This no-talent band was so baked that they never knew what they were doing. What the certainly were not doing was making music. It's god-awful bands like this that paved the way for modern grunge rock and (god help us all) the merger with rap to become hip-hop.I give this band and its album zero stars, which is five more than the negative five it deserves."
4,Songs not performed much live are the best.,"The Dead, throughout their history evolved into several different bands. Of the eary psychedelic stuff, this is my fave.Some great songs rarely or never played live are ""Doin that Rag"" and ""Cosmic Charlie"" (sure this one had dumb lyrics, but musically it is quite rich,though it'll fool you into thinking its simple). China Cat also holds it own in the studio, but St. Sthephen does not."
4,Great songs done (a little) too trippily,"These songs are all great--save for...you know...--and were welcomed into the live repertoire with open arms, where they really flowered. So, if you want to hear studio versions of those songs, then listen to this tripped-out album from 1969. I could say that ""China Cat"" was done better live in Europe, etc., but why spoil the fun. It's sort of a blend of ""Workingman"" and ""Anthem"", and they found out that ""The Twist"" and LSD don't really mix...on record, that is."
3,The original was superior...,"The 1969 version, not yet released on CD, was much better. While some songs sounded almost exactly the same, most sounded more raw, a plus in my book. The 1971 remix (the one you hear on the CD and most vinyl copies) effectively sterilized the sound. ""What About the Baby"" lost all of the screaming and pots&pans acid sound effects that actually made it cool. If you can get a copy of the 1969 vinyl [ W7(WS1790) -not- WB(1790) ], you owe it to yourself to compare.There is a market for the '69 version on CD. At least I would buy one."
4,Sweet Jumps from a Sweet Legend!,"My kid loves this toy! Really reminds me of the years I had a toy near identical to this one. Yes, pricey but I am sorry it comes with some really cool stuff, and a certificate and cool autographed poster. Toys like this just don't exist anymore, this was refreshing throwback of sorts!"
4,Pretty Good. Original was better.,"It seems like when I was a kid, I was able to control my Evel Knievel motorcycle better, as well as to make it jump farther than this set. My 6 year old still thinks it's cool, but I won't tell him that my original set was better.The quality is comparable to most other Chinese-made toys sold these days. Nothing seems like it's made as good at it used to be, but this set is not inferior to new Hot Wheels playsets.There are some cool accessories here that make it a good time consuming activity for kids that doesn't involve TV. For the money, it's not a bad value. Just hoped it would be as fun as my set was when I was 6."
3,I guess I'm too old; not as fun as it was when I was 10.,"Toy is built well-enough to handle lots of use. The included ramps are flimy and narrow (use cardboard and a brick for a ramp). I bought it for my son...we have had fun with it. Not as thrilling as it used to be. My son does not play with it very often.The bike tends to come off the ramp as you begin turning the crank. You must awkwardly hold the bike onto the ramp, keep the ramp planted firmly to the ground and crank the handle all at once....a bit challenging."
1,Fun but extremely poor made!!,"This toy is a complete piece of crap. It never went more than 10 feet before falling over (I could have lived with that) but the worst part of the toy is the garbage materials they made the inner gears out of, they were worn out in 2 days. I will be going to ebay to find an origonal one. They may have used the same molds as the origonal to make the bike, but the materials they now use are far inferior to the origonal. It was sad that I gave this to my 3 year old (who was asking santa for it)for xmass and she never got the enjoyment out of it that I had gotten from the origonal on in the 70's. I cant stress enough DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP IT WILL ONLY LEAD TO DISSSAPOINTMENT!!! Especially if you owned an origonal!!"
4,EVEL KNIEVEL DELUX STUNT SET,"As you can see from past postings, there is a lot of disappointment with this set. This is down to poor quality control, with a lot of bikes not put together correctly. Trust me, get a good one and it's a lot of fun, a bad one, and it's worse than useless. Come on poof-slinky/ideal, this iconic toy deserves better!"
4,Durable and detailed,"Wonderful complement (all of these sets) to the natural wood dollhouses. Detailed, includes small pieces that will be misplaced but despite the rough, imaginative play of two toddler boys, we haven't broken anything yet.Great value for the money, just not very visually stimulating. Warning, though... you won't be able to stop at just one set!"
2,It was ok.,"I thought the exitement in this narrative paperback was exceptional, yet the characters seemed quite folley in their disposition. Phoebe was intellectually disabled, and Jem was a little stupid for my taste."
5,It makes History come Alive!,Phoebe Olcott is amazing! She travelled all that distance tosave peoples lifes so the same fate that happened to Gideon would nothappen to others. Even though her father fought for the Americans and her uncle was a Loyalist she followed her own beliefs and struggles through the forest to met Jem Morrissay.
5,The best book,"I loved this book, I couldn't put it down it is soooooo exitin and it has a great ending, I think everyone should read it."
1,It was...alright,"This book was okay, but it could have been a little more exciting, and could have had more characters."
3,Its okay...,"I kind of regretted the purchase actually, Its just okay, nothing spectacular picture wise, I wouldn't say BEAUTIFUL; lets put it that way."
2,Disappointment,"What a disappointment. Beautiful pictures of archaeological sites, architectural elements, desert scenery; pretty Persian miniatures, nice diagrams and drawings BUT where are the gardens? Oh, maybe after page 100 or so we start to see photos that actually look like the garden was the main focus of the picture. That's what I get for ordering books sight unseen, huh. I gave it a 2 because it was nice for what it was and because I lived in Iran in the late 70s and there were some nostalgic moments in it for me."
5,Two turn-of-the-century English 'serenades',"A couple of little-heard gems here for the combined forces of woodwind with either brass or strings, played by the chamber music group Capricorn. Capricorn was formed in 1973 as a quartet but, prompted by the success of its performances, it soon expanded to include other players. On this CD they play the delightful Nonets by two pillars of the late 19th and early 20th century music in England - Sir Hubert Parry and Sir Charles Villiers Stanford. Both works are in the conventional four-movement format and recall the Serenades of Mozart, Dvorak and Richard Strauss in their tonal quality. The Parry is scored for flute, oboe, cor anglais, clarinets and bassoons with two horns and dates from 1877. The Stanford Nonet is given a warmer sound by the inclusion of a string quintet to accompany the flute, clarinet and bassoon. These delightful chamber works deserve to be much better known.Dvorak: Serenades Op. 22 & 44"
5,DISSECTION RULES!!!!!!!,BUY THIS OR DIE!!!!! THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BM ALBUMS EVER!!! HAIL DISSECTION!!!
5,Untouchable,"When I first heard this album, I had no clue what black metal was.... I was still listening to Guns 'n Roses, Metallica, Megadeth, etc. A friend introduced me to it and I was completely blown away! I have never heard anything like, and come to think of it, nothing has even come close to this day! Jon's haunting vocals and the melodic guitar work make SOTLB so unique. And the fact that there is a huge debate over wether this is a black metal album or not, just makes this album so much more special. I'm not sure if this is black metal or not, but what I do know, is that SOTLB is my favorite metal album..... period!!!"
2,Band out of ideas. First album better.,"""The Somberlain"" said it all and this is a more compact offering of the same material, with sentiment where once a fire of emotion burned. I would rather listen to a 5th-generation tape of the first Dissection album than hear this again. Their music, which is neoclassical melodic metal with black metal influences, peaks when it reaches a relaxing and hypnotic peak of quickly changing riffing with flair. For someone getting into black metal, this band is a better entry point from heavy metal (ick) than Cradle of Filth."
5,Fabulous Book,This book is absolutly wonderful. I was inspired and transformed. The author has such a poetic way of guiding you to your higher self.
1,One of the worst books I have ever read!,This book has maybe 10 pages on building a fence from the ground up. The rest is mostly filler and pictures of the types of fences that are out there. I would not recommend this book to anyone!
5,Pastry Pizza Roller,Great for rolling out dough for pizza. Especially good when making small Ramekin Pizzas for individual servings.See [...] for Pizza pot pie recipe. Watch time to only cook to medium brown.
4,great for rolling out pizza dough,This handy little roller is great for rolling out pizza dough. The wide end helps with most of the rolling and the smaller end helps get an edge for the crust. We took the time to oil both end before our first use to reduce the stickiness of the rollers. Pizza dough has its own sticky texture and the roller helps get a consistently even crust.
4,A great product,"This is a very useful tool. I use it mostly to roll shortbread dough in the baking pan. It's true that the wood tends to get dry and rough. However, a generous coating of cooking oil, followed by air-drying, after every 3rd use keeps the roughness under control."
3,Get a plastic or marble one,"After only having this for a short time, the wood started to peel back from getting wet.Do not get this if you plan on washing it. The handle now gives me splinters. I ended up getting a pampered chef plastic oneand it works way better. It costs more but I highly recommend the pampered chef one."
4,Very cool!,easy to clean and it does its job. I like that it does not stick to the dough as long as its floured
2,Not a long term investment...,"My husband and I make pizza twice a week and use this to roll out our 100% whole wheat crust. Before we purchased this little piece of work we had used the same roller for 3 years. We used this for about two months before it broke. Basically, we got what we paid for."
5,This thing is awesome,I used to use a rolling pin (that wouldn't fit in the pan right) or a sturdy glass that was straight. This thing does the job so much better than all of these. I worked dough into the pan and rolled it out to perfection! Buy it!!!
5,The Hero Within,"A great mannual that makes arcetypal information very accessible and practical. Well written, down to earth, well researched, and well organized; Pearson has covered all of the bases to empower folk to make friends with our interior human life."
1,my own fault,"I thought this would be all about Archetypes and it was mostly a self- help book. Yes, I am dumb."
4,BEWARE SECOND-HAND SALES OF THIS ITEM!,"I have ordered this item twice in the past two weeks through Amazon Marketplace. Although each time I received my order promptly, IN EACH INSTANCE THE SECOND DISC WAS MISSING! This 2-disc set is in completely separate disc cases, and if you are not paying attention, it is quite easy to not notice that the case is labeled ""Disc One"" on the spine and in the back text. As much as I would like to have a physical copy of this CD set, I can't take another chance that I am only going to get half my order again so I'm giving up and just ordering this on iTunes."
4,A Man and His Music,"Good for diehard fans only. Beware of the fact that only ONE disc is offered through Amazon. I know not what to do about obtaining full two-disc set,but it's worth finding out."
3,Sinatra-The last true STAR,"Sit back and enjoy the voice. From Tommy D. to L A is my lady to Trilogy, the true Star quality will always be with us. Perhaps many people feel as I do that we can relive the past while still enjoying the present with Sinatra in the background."
5,I love this Chantal Pie Pan,"I never bake pies, but have used it for cooking in both the oven and microwave. It is easy to clean and sturdy, besides being the prettiest pie dish I own, I often will use it as a deep-dish dinner plate, to keep foods warm."
5,"peter, paul and mommy","My niece and nephew had the LP when they were young. Both were excited that I was able to find it for their children. ""The Marvelous Toy"" was aeveryone's favorite and still is !"
3,serious at times,"Though I love the cd over all, it is at times, a bit serious in theme for little ones. It makes a good pre-nap cd."
5,Exactly as I remember it!,"""When I was just a wee little lad...""So starts ""The Marvelous Toy"" When I was young, my parents bought this album and played it for me - and later I played it myself - all the time. Of course, back then, we owned it recorded using the new technology of ""cassette tape"" My, how times have changed - and haven't. Now that I have my own sons, this was the first MP3 album I bought, and play it for them regularly. The Amazon MP3 recording is of excellent audio quality, and with it they get to learn the wonders of Puff the Magic Dragon while suffering through their father's terrible singing.What will happen when they're old enough to ask me not to sing along? Who knows? But this album will definitely stand the test of time. Few mainstream artists today take the time to carefully assemble a thoughtful childrens' album, while this one has remained excellent and relevant from 1969 until today. You should not hesitate, but definitely buy it right away."
5,Peter Paul & Mommy,"I loved this when it first came out & got it for my grandkids. They haven't had a chance to hear it yet, but I am lovin' it!"
3,Disappointed with the seller,I paid extra for expedited shipping because I was sending it to my son who was out o the state for only 2 weeks. The email said it would be there too late for him to even get it. I emailed the seller to ask why the shipping was going to take so long but never got a response. I would never use this seller again.
4,Great Product,This will really help the students get stronger in SAT. Great product for the students.Few suggestions1. In the screen they should have made the Speakers face little and should have given more room for the e.gs they are showing in writing. Currently the letters are so small to read and the speaker is occupying 85% of the screen space2. The speaker is talking too fast3. The various important points should be reiteratedI wanted to give 5 Stars but because of the above 3 lapse I am giving only 4
1,Not worth the money,I bought this expecting good songs and good guitar playing. It's boring and most of the songs are the same.
5,Superb!,"This is one of those CDs that can be heard again and again. Elena Kuschnerova is a pianist that deserves far greater fame than she has been accorded to date, and there is every reason to believe that she will receive it. She lets these works speak for themselves, using a strong and noble tone with an enormous range of colors.The Etudes Op. 8 are the highlight of this disc. These works are a tremendous technical challenge, without appearing to be so. The interpretation on this disc is particularly noteworthy, as the entire Op. 8 can be heard as a complete work, and not as a group of separate small pieces.I might add that I am not alone in my opinion. Everyone who has heard this CD has fallen in love with it, even those who have told me that they don't like Scriabin. Highly advised."
3,"Great Features, Poor Legibility","The Good:The vibrating alarm is great! It allows me to wake up without a loud alarm disturbing my wife. I also use the virating alarm when referreeing soccer matches. If the match is loud, keep both eyes on the field and still know when the period of play expires.The Bad:The dark background; small AM/PM and alarm symbols, and smokey crystal reduce the watch legibility. This is particularly a problem in low light or when setting the alarm (usually at night with low-light).Conclusion:The vibrating wristwatch alarm is very useful, and there are not many alternatives. I wish Freestyle would expand the Buzz line and improve the contrast on the watch face (user interface)."
3,"Msgr. Stuart Swetalnd, Fr. Malaprops, Splits the Difference","Who knows what to make of the EWTN-phenomenon as an historical cultural artifact ultimately. Super traditionalists think one thing, and liberals think another. What is the ""objective"" observer to make of it all? I dare not say, for I am hardly ultimately objective on the matter. But I will tell you this. That the best summary of the contradictions of the phenomenon may have been uttered by Msgr. Stuart Swetland on the program ""Catholcism on Campus"". In discussing some topic he announced one of the best, and funniest religious malapropsims ever: ""Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, what lies in wait for us.."" Indeed, God is lying in wait for you. That strangely sort of sums up the weird destiny of modern Catholicism, That is sacred paranoia! Bravo!"
3,ALL WRONG!!!!!,"The book is interesting but very wrong. There is nothing heterodox about EWTN as ""traditionalists"" contend. Sadly, the traditionalists have one thing in common with the Church dissenters on the left like Call To Action. They both never seem to have actually READ the documents of Vatican II. The best explanation of this phenomenon is in Fr. Richard John Neuhaus' book ""Catholic Matters"". Now that book is a 5 star read."
1,Very misleading,"when you frist look at this in your mind and thoughtsyou say man this is a cool doll house and you get to decorate it too,,,,,,,,WRONG ITS JUST THE DECORATION THATS ALL,i didnt relize this until i re-check my order two days after.what a mess here it is 2 weeks b-4 x-mas and the sad thing is a bouhght stuff to go with this and its not even a dollhouse ...."
1,NOT A DOLLHOUSE!!!,"Very misleading to say the least! My grandaughter and I were very disapointed when we discovered that this is decorations, and not a dollhouse. I bought livingroom and bedroom sets to go with what I thought was a dollhouse."
3,opt for bigger dolls,"As I stated in the review for the Jeff version of this doll, the sound gave out in all of these dolls I purchased in only a few days. There is no way to open them up and replace batteries or anything, so once they stop making sounds, that's it. The reviews for the bigger Wiggle dolls were more favorable (I don't have them, so I can't comment) so I would recommend that you spring the extra money for the bigger dolls. These beanie ones don't last."
3,"An Uneven ""Don Q""","Douglas Fairbanks' 1925 sequel to ""The Mark of Zorro"" lacks the swashbuckling fun that made the original a classic. Running nearly two hours, the overlong ""Don Q"" suffers from needless plot exposition. However, Doug's memorable stunts and a splendid climax save the day. The production values are impeccable, with some beautifully detailed sets. ""Don Q"" remains an above-average Fairbanks vehicle, but judicious editing would have helped."
5,Clean and Simple,"It works exactly as it says it does! It's easier with 4 hands, but could be done with one person. It was a perfect alternative to a chair rail for my daughter's nursery."
4,Pearl Piccolo snare drum,"Got this snare earlier than the time they said , its sounds really good the drummer loves it. It seems pretty sturdy and professional as it is completely steel. Bought it for my church. LOVE IT!!! A recommended buy."
2,Not as good as her earlier books,"I was disappointed in this book. I loved Ms Krahn's early books but althought this book made me laugh at times I was annoyed by the lead female. She was very un-pleasantly stubborn and down right stupid sometimes and the plot of finding long lost scrolls was contrived and not very believable. I loved the hard hitting hero but the female character was dreary and not very smart, he deserved better."
3,The Book of the Seven Delights,"After being relegated to the basement of the British Museum, Abigail Merchant is determined to prove she is worth more than being an employee whose presence is merely on sufferance. Finding a clue to a treasure, she sets off to find a lost library of hte ancient world. Her quest begins on rocky footing, as Abigail is promptly seasick. The only one willing to tend her in her distress is the most annoying and handsome Apollo Smith. He assumes the role of protector/ thorn in her side across exotic locales, barely a step ahead of danger. Mutual hate turns to lust and something deeper as they journey, and Abigail learns that the true treasure is love.*** If Indiana Jones landed in a Regency Romance, then this would be the result. Fast paced adventure will sweep you along until the dramatic end. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
3,not waterproof,greatwatch just fogs up if i go in the wateri expected water proofd so would or should spend more on a better watch
1,Filled with water at a depth of 1 foot,"Stay away from this piece of crap and it's manufacturer. My wife got me one of these for Christmas for our January trip to Jamaica and snorkeling trips. After being in the water snorkeling, floating on the surface, the watch never got more that 1 foot below the water's surface. I could not see the time while underwater due to the grey on black display, which defeated the purpose of the watch. When I got out of the water about 30 minutes later, it was full of water! Not what I expected for a watch that states it is water resistant to 330 feet!My wife contacted the seller (House of Scuba) and was told since she had purchased the watch over a month prior, they would do nothing about it. We could pay the postage to ship it back to them, and then pay them to fix it, and then pay to have it shipped back to us.Stay away from Freestyle and the House of Scuba!!!"
2,Pretty Simple,"Dont expect much from this poor quality watch, buy a Timex isntead. The watch looks not so bad, but if you`re thinking surfing with it. think twice, since the first time i went to the beach, there was a lick on the screen."
1,They sent the wrong item,I ordered the paint sprayer with the metal container and they sent a paint sprayer with a plastic container. I would not buy again from this firm as they sent a cheaper item from what was ordered.
2,Not enough truffle flavor,"The oil does not have enough truffle flavor. The price is good, but I would try a more expensive oil in order to get more essence of the truffle."
3,Not as good as some other truffle oils,I thought the truffle flavor was not strong enough and I wasn't crazy about the flavor of the olive oil itself. I've had better luck with the Urbani White Truffle Oil. So far that's my favorite out of the few kinds that I've tried.
1,buy a different edition!,"This was a miserable translation, even when it was first published, and for far too many years it was the only one avaiable in English. Now, however, there are far better choices. The Wood-Nisbet version published by Cambridge is far superior, but I believe that mine (HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RIGHT, Focus Press) is the best of the lot. For some reasons, see either my review of the Wood-Nisbet edition, or Peter Kalkavage's review of mine, on its Amazon page."
5,Well worth the money!,I was so pleased with the Ryan's Room Bedroom Suite! It is well made and a wonderful addition to the doll house. Well worth the money! I highly recommend it!!!!
1,This item not received,"Received a Cooking up fun kitchen instead of the master bedroom (had ordered a fun kitchen, received 2 of them)"
5,A Classic,"I loved Casper as a kid, and now both my children love the friendly ghost. I thought they might like these old cartoons, but I was surprised at how much given their high level of tech sophistication. My daughter thinks it's neat they are ""from the olden days."""
5,My favorite,"of the regular Senseo coffees. I guess I just prefer milder coffee, but this is my favorite way to start the day. Senseo rules!"
4,Senseo Coffee,"Love this coffee. Can't find it anywhere in town (Winn Dixie, Wal-Mart or Publix)I am refering to the ""Mild."" My only complaint is that twice now I have gone to order more and you are out of the ""Mild."" Please try to keep it in stock so I don't have to order it elsewhere. Thanks, Tina"
1,awful,"I recently purchased a Senseo. After brewing my 1st cup, I almost took it back. The Senseo coffee is awful. But, I went to my local grocery store and purchased some Yuban Columbian coffee pods. What a difference. It is pretty good - actually tastes and smells like real coffee. I can't say the same for the Senseo brand. I look forward to trying other brands."
3,West Against the Wind,"This was an interesting story about the 1820's Gold Fever told as the characters travel west to California. For me, this was required summer reading for 8th grade. The main character is Abby, who becomes a women and falls in love during her travels. Too girly for my taste."
1,This was one of the worst books ever,I have never in my life read a more boring book than this. It was assigned to my 8th grade class and not one student liked it
2,stopped working after a year,I bought these a year ago. They worked fine for my 6x9 foot pond. After about 6 months a bulb would burn out and I would replace it. But then others would burn out and I replace them and they wouldnt work. My husband looked at it and said water was inside the light and shorted them out. There were little burn marks inside. Now they dont work and for $40+ I might buy something else.The transformer needed to have a timer so you dont have to plug this one into a timer.
5,Great submersible lights,My husband got these for me for Christmas and they are lovely. I put them in my fish pond and they are perfect. Having the different colors to cover the lights is a nice touch. The worked flawlessly through the freezing winter months. I would buy these again.
3,Lights aren't bright enough,"I purchased this set of lights for a 5ft wide x 6ft tall fountain and while the lights are visible, they really aren't bright enough to attract attention from more than 10 feet away. The ability of the lights to swivel are a nice feature but ultimately, I decided to purchase a different set of lights with 20-watt halogen bulbs and the difference is very noticeable. These lights may be sufficient for a very small pond but if you really want people to notice your fountain/pond, I would purchase a set of lights that have halogen bulbs."
4,Good Product,"THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE WITH THIS PRODUCT IS THE WIRING FROM ONE LIGHT TO ANOTHER SHOULD BE LONGER, IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PLACE THE LIGHTS IN THE POSITION YOU WANT THEM TO BE IN YOUR POND, I DON'T KNOW WHY SUNTERRA NEEDS TO BE SO CHEAP WITH THEIR WIRING. JUST ADDING TWO FEET OF WIRING WOULD MAKE THIS A 5 STAR PLUS PRODUCT. THE LIGHTS WORK GREAT, I HAVE TWO IN MY POND AND ONE BEHIND A WATERFALL AS A BACKLIGHT AND IT WORKS VERY WELL. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR A SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZE POND."
1,Terrible Defective Product,"This product did not work when I received it. Do not buy this product. I haven't been able to find a way to contact the seller either...Again, this product is a scam, buy it at your own risk."
2,Sunterra Lite kit for water garden,The lights work fine but if one changes the lens a few times the prongs holding them on snaps off and your stuck with bright white lights only.Would not recomendthis product.
4,SHORT RUN BETWEEN LIGHTS,"I have purchased over 10 Sunterra lights in the last year. They hold up well, and are indeed waterproof for total submersion - provided you make sure the plastic lens is perfectly aligned with the gasket - otherwise, they will leak. I give them 4 out of 5 stars, because the photo is deceptive. When you purchase individual lights, each comes with a 6' cord. This set of 3 has them hard wired together in a daisy-chain series. Each lamp is only about 4' from the last one, so it severely limits placement in a pond larger than 6' diameter."
4,Pond Lights,This set of Sunterra lights is much better than the old egg-lites by calpump. The design seems to keep water away from the bulbs so we expect much better life and performance. One of the 3 bulbs was not working upon installing. Sunterra is supposed to send us a replacement. We use these in a small fountain with a timer turning the set on/off. They had been in about a month.
2,lights burn out quickly,"its work fine and provides bright light (20 watts), but i don't have them on a timer, and the lights only last about 1 month. Don't know how long they last with a timer, but keep it in mind."
5,In Ocean Underwater Lighting,"These are great underwater lights. I am using them off the dock in my back yard (underwater) to attract fish---these are mostly sea bass which are attracted to the lights and we get to watch them grow. Now and again a manta ray, shark or an occasional seal comes by!"
3,"Nice lights, a few areas for improvement.","I've been through a few sets of these over the years with my Koi and duck pond. They are great little lights, but they only last a couple of seasons, and then need to be replaced. Usually the set does outlast the life of the bulbs, which are easily replaced and available at Home Depot for a few dollars. The only complaints with this light set is that the lights are too close together and there is not enough flexibility in terms of placement in the pond."
1,Pond Lights,"Sunterra 300309 Submersible Light Kit for Water Gardens, Three Lights with Transformer, BlackI ordered the pond lights to replace a set I have had for years. In the water for only three weeks and one does not work already"
3,"OK, but only half as good as the first one",Start with the first Bikini Summer movie. It's the same movie only way better. You won't have to put up with some boring subplot about helping a couple of homeless people. That could have been a nice Disney movie but doesn't belong in Bikini Summer. And the first movie has more nudity - even a couple of full-frontal scenes. I think that gives an extra dimension to movies like this.
3,come on...,"this movie was good until the bob sagetish moral, meaning of life, message to the people or whatever u wanna call it came in the script.it is like full house with nudity. if youre bored and wanna see some nudity, or girls from the early 90 in bikini. make your day."
1,Jeff Conaway (from TAXI) Directed This...,"And it is chaotic, incomprehensible! Jessica Hahn, top billed is on display for about 90 seconds (you think she can act?) Everything else is chop suey, editing room out-jokes (the opposite of in-jokes), vapid, soft core, exploitation. This movie was made by people who know that a name in the news, and female nudity will separate a certain type (worldwide) from their cashola."
3,scratches easily,"I've had it for a few weeks and it's covered in scratches. It had a scratch after one day of use. Not sure what it's getting scratched on, I carry my phone in the pocket with my wallet. Maybe just grit or something... The few weeks I had the phone before getting the screen protector the screen didn't get any scratches. So I guess the screen is a lot harder than the protector.But the main reason I chose this protector was because it was supposed to be very clear and not distort the screen, and it is as clear as I'd hoped (except for where it is scratched). So I gave it three stars for that, but knocked off two for how surprisingly easy to scratch it is."
2,Boring and lacking the passion,"I listened to the beautiful set of the Op. 11 preludes, and what a disappointment! Lane simply loses it all. He has no feeling for the passion inherent in this music of a genius."
3,Inspirational but short on substance,"Maybe it's because the book isn't what I was expecting, but I felt a little let down. It's a lot like those Life's Little Instruction Booklet type books--just a bunch of pithy one-liners & suggestions. A few of the quotes were lame, for example, ""if the Sunday School is to improve, it must change; if it is to grow, it must plan for growth."" Duh. Most of the suggestions were great, but they didn't give any details on how to actually do what it suggests, for example, ""plan an annual teacher training event to improve and develop the skills of all teachers."" Good advice! However it doesn't tell you how to structure the event, what to teach the teachers, or any of the other information you might need to actually run a teacher training event. Don't get me wrong - the book is good for what it is; just be sure you know what it is you are getting"
2,very basic,"Covers line diagrams of basic japanese tools. Is a reference guide with lots of wasted space. Not worth 2,200 yen.Very basic"
4,Maybe I am one of the few but I liked it.,"Okay, I know some people don't like this movie. I think that it is a cute 80's flick. I would always watch it when it was on TV and one day I brought a copy of it. Is it worth the [price]? Maybe it should be cheeper. The Actor who played Morgan did a good joband so did the girl who played his girlfriend."
3,Horror Movie Fans,"OK, I wish I were lucky enough to have been in this movie as an extra. I grew up watching this movie for some odd, sad reason and think it is pretty alright. I wonder if my affection is solely based on my past-watching it almost every Saturday night for about a year on BETA! I think it also has to do with Cryer's ability to make any movie likeable, even an Alan Smithee movie! Plus, it is just cool to see an Alan Smithee movie. I also like any movie that pays tribute to Horror movie geeks. Come on, the Brady Thanksgiving scene is so very touching!"
4,Simply an good 80s teen movie that brings back memories,"Simply an 80s teen movie that brings back memories. It's nice to not see cell phones, computers, and other modern things in this movie."
1,What a rotten piece of garbage,The laughs just aren't there in this lifeless piece of dreck. But I'm biased. I appear as an extra (check the redhead in that scene with Cryer coming down the stairs to get the bad news phone call at the private school). And the bastards paid me with a check that bounced!Perhaps I deserved it for appearing in this terrible film.The reviewer who liked this movie is just completely insane.
3,Morgan Stuart's Parents Suck and Have No Idea What A Child Is...,"This movie was a piece of 80's nostalgia for me. Something I remembered things about but had no remembrance of the plot line. It was just an ok movie at best. First off, his parents shipped him off to boarding school, not because he was a horrible child, but to get him out of the way for their political campaigns. When they decided they needed to put a positive spin on their family life, they invited him back to live with them... only their home was much more prison like than boarding school. Morgan finally sneaks off and meets a girl, and their escapades are the only saving grace of the movie. Don't waste your time unless you want to revisit 80's nostalgia or one of Jon Cryer's few early leading roles."
5,No Widescreen Release?,"I'm glad this is coming to DVD after all these years as it's one of my favorite 80's films, but only released in fullscreen? I'm hoping a widescreen version is also in the works."
4,How can you fault it,"How can you fault a movie that opens with a close up of the poster for Fulci's ZOmbie, features a George A Romero look-alike, and has the horror film geek's answer to Richie Rich - the kid with all the toys you wanted!! I mean, a Tobe Hooper autographed chainsaw!!I love this movie and I salute the others on this page who share my affections!**wishing for a DVD release**"
3,Review: Combating the Commandment of Confusion,"My family and I received a complimentary version of the DVD Bibleman: Combating the Commandment of Confusion: A Bibleman LIVE Adventure from Tommy Nelson Publishing. This was our first family experience with Bibleman.This particular DVD provides a LIVE experience of Bibleman. It is showing a production they did before a live studio audience. The theme of the show was Ephesians 6 the full armor of God.The kids gave the movie 2 thumbs up. The adults survived the movie! The acting is not spectacular by any means and the enemy of confusion was well, confusing. But the Biblical content is supreme and the way Bibleman uses the Scripture to fight the enemy is pretty incredible. If your kids like superheros and the Bible then you might want to try out Bibleman. Just expect 1980's acting and effects and you'll be fine!"
3,Use the Armor of God with Care,"Combating The Commandant of Confusion: A Bibleman Live Adventureis a classic story about good vs. evil. Every situation that we encounter in life requires us to have a plethora of tools to help protect us from falling prey to evildoers. This story is about protecting ourselves with the armor of God.The setting, Bible Adventure Training Academy, provides a unique interactive backdrop for the story to develop. The Commandant of Confusion and his sidekick, Chaos, use large words to confuse campers, which makes it easy for them to steal the Bible Team's secret weapon.Overall, I felt the story clearly conveyed the scripture lesson: ""God is not a God of confusion but a God of peace."" (1 Corinthians 14:33). My younger children really enjoyed the video while the older ones sort of rolled their eyes. I would definitely recommendCombating The Commandant of Confusion: A Bibleman Live Adventurefor children under the age of 8."
2,Great for little kids...,"When I was younger I went to a private Christian school. We always watched Bibleman, so this DVD was a blast from the past!In this DVD, Bibleman teaches the ABC's of Salvation. He also teaches that Satan tries to confuse use but God is a peaceful God and does not want us to be confused but wants to teach us what's right and how to protect ourselves from Satan's confusion! Satan in this movie steals the armor of God. It teaches good principles but is geared for much younger children. I would say 4-8.Watching it as an adult now, with it being filmed live, it's not the best film quality. It teaches good morales and the Bible, but as a whole the movie is not that great. When I was younger I did however remember liking them. I personally at 26, would not sit down and watch this movie, but I will show it to my daughter, who is currently under a year, when she is a little older!I am a book/dvd reviewer for Thomas Nelson Publishing and am just stating my opinion."
3,A bit Corny,This Bibleman Powersource DVD is on the topic of The Armour of God and how the devil tries to confuse us. I admit this was my first experience watching any of the BibleMan dvd's and I was quite pleased. It's a great live performance for your children ages 6-10 to experience.One of my favored things about this dvd is how much scripture it uses. A good half of the words spoken are scriptural. And when they use scripture the characters will give the reference to it.The main aspect of this series I love is how at the end of each live performance BibleMan gives the plan of salvation in a kid-friendly way using the acronym ABC. A- Admit you are a sinner. B- Believe that Christ came and died for your sin. C- Choose to believe in Him. Of course he elaborates more than that for the kids and then prays the prayer of salvation with those who ABC.* This dvd resource was provided to me by the publisher for review purposes.
3,"Fun for fans, but not novices","My older boys have fond memories of watching the original Bibleman episodes. Granted, there is a corny-ness approach to the production. But, that is something that they've enjoyed.They were looking forward to watching this particular DVD. However, the live action format was not well received by them. If they truly adored Bibleman, then this might have been more enjoyable to watch. They still want to see other episodes, just not the live action format.I'd strongly recommend this NOT be the first Bibleman viewing experience for a family. Your disappointment might keep you from watching the others."
4,"Great DVD, great message","I recently received this DVD to review and my girls loved it! We were actually on our way to church when the girls started watching this Bibleman DVD in the car. After church, our older daughter said, ""Mom, don't forget that our movie is on!"" and they finished watching the movie on the way home.The best way to say this is, my kids loved this movie! My girls are ages 8 and almost 12 and both enjoyed this movie's message. In fact, they both asked if we could buy the other Bibleman movie that focuses on bullying!I personally love the message in this movie - ""God is not a God of confusion but a God of peace."" 1 Corinthians 14:33 (ICB). And, the way that this message is delivered is very kid-friendly; a little humor and super-heroes!I recommend this DVD, great message and perfect for kids!This complimentary DVD was sent to me by Book Sneeze to review. The opinions are mine (and my girls!)."
2,Silly,"While teaching at the Bible Adventure Training Academy, the Bibleman's (a human transformed by the word of God) secret weapon, the armor is God is stolen by the treacherous villains. Bibleman and his Bible Team must stop the villains from using the weapon against them.I honestly never knew anything about Bibleman when I received this DVD to review. Not counting the bonus features, the LIVE episode is under forty minutes, and was somewhat painful for me to watch. It's obvious that this shows is aimed for a younger audience. The acting is horrible, the costumes are silly, and the special effects are even worse. It reminds me of the ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"" but with a Christian twist to it. Bibleman is like a superhero with a light saber. There are a few fight scenes to keep a kid's interests. Despite the moral messages, the story is still the basic good vs. evil storyline, but with bad production values."
2,A Little Too Corny for My Taste,"Coming from a family of avid Bibleman fans, I was excited to receive this video for review. However, after the first 10 minutes, my child was unable to sit and endure the corny LIVE performance. Although rich in biblical truth, the acting leaves a lot to be desire. We much prefer the older Bibleman videos."
3,Stick with the Original,"When the boys were younger we would always stock up on the newest Bibleman videos when we were going on any type of trips. They LOVED Bibleman videos and I loved the fact that every episode taught a Scriptural truth. When I was offered the chance to review this new DVD, I accepted the opportunity because I knew the boys would get a kick out of seeing a new episode and I would love to share it with a friend.We were all really disappointed that this wasn't a true episode, but a LIVE show. There isn't necessarily anything wrong with a LIVE show except that the recording wasn't a very quality recording. I asked my boys to watch this and they did, but they both said they preferred the original Bibleman to this.I still LOVE the premise of Bibleman. He uses the ""sword of truth"" to fight his battles. Every episode has an amazing Scripture basis. However, if you are wanting to create a Bibleman fan I wouldn't start with this video."
3,"Good message, but.....","I received this DVD as part of the BookSneeze program through Thomas Nelson Publishers. I was given this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion.It is hard to review this DVD as a whole. This was our first viewing of Bible Man. My son is too old for this series, but I thought perhaps my younger girls might enjoy it. Ummm...I was wrong. They did not even finish watching it the first time. It is rather cheesy and not very well put together. The audience it's intended for would love it, I am sure. Just not my girls.I have heard that the older versions of Bibleman are better. If you are new to Bibleman, I'd start there. I LOVE the concept of Bibleman, just not this particular example."
4,"amazing message, only wish it were animated","When we first received the dvd I was a bit discouraged... it seemed so cheesy. The dvd is a life action and executed in a very amateurish manner. HOWEVER... the message behind the adventure is just awesome~! They use the Word as their shield and sword. My boys LOVE this and have really absorbed the biblical messages and their life applications. I only WISH it were animated - it would easily be a 5 star rating. I received this dvd as part of the blogger reviewer network and am providing my honest, open opinion."
3,Not the Old Bibleman,"I haven't watched a Bibleman video for a number of years. But I used to love them. I don't know if this video is typical of the Bibleman videos put out now, but if it is I'm disappointed. Basically it has the camera pointed toward the stage for a Bibleman show. Bibleman show are great when they're live, but not videotaped. The old Bibleman use to feature a story about a child battling a problem in his or her life. Bibleman would show up and teach them how they could defeat that problem using the power of God and God's Word. Then he and his team would defeat the demonic villian behind the problem. None of that is there. It's now just a show, which is fine. But it won't reach children like it did in the past. My recommendation is that you use your money on other resources."
3,Not Calphalon's greatest...,"These aren't bad for a low-end price, but it isn't calphalon's greatest product. If you just want some inexpensive cookware that says ""Calphalon"" on it, then these are fine, but Calphalon has some other lines which are SO MUCH more durable and lasting. I would recommend getting Simply Calphalon Non-stick or Contemporary instead if you really want professional quality non-stick cookware. I bought this line when I remodeled my kitchen because I was attracted to the price, but you get what you pay for. After a few weeks I decided to donate the set I bought from Target and got the Calphalon Contemporary set and I LOVE them."
1,Finish Flaked within 6 months,"Pass on this if you're looking for something to use beyond 6 months. I used it everyday, and honestly, 6 months of use was pushing it. Finish flaked right off and into our food. Teflon and aluminum in our food. If you're concerned about cooking with oil, check into the benefits of certain oils, such as grape seed, rice bran, etc."
5,A Good Place to Start,"Being that I am relatively new to scrapbooking, this book is a good place to start. I had also purchased the earlier book (Quick & Easy Scrapbook Pages), and both books are good sources for page layouts. I tend to find that anything that's written by Memory Makers is a sure winner."
4,murder,A good look into a time of innocence shattered by a terrible triple murder of little boys with some interesting ties to later crimes.
5,Great coffee!!,"If you are an avid coffee drinker & are looking for something new to try, this is it! Great price & great taste. Definitely one to keep on hand. Makes a great cup hot or iced!"
1,Nothing Like the Earlier Lindsays,"Having the earlier Lindsay Quartet set of the Late Quartets, I was curious about their new, more recent, digital cycle. Unfortunately, their interpretation of the opp. 130 and 133 has become much sharper and more agressive. All of the dynmaics seem exaggerated and the whole performance seems so mannered that the players call attention to themselves rather than to the music. For a digital recording, the Takacs Quartet is superb. For good analogue, the earlier Lindsays and the Talich too. If you don't mind mono, the Hollywood and Busch Quartets are still hard to beat."
1,Poor recording!,"The music and the performance on this disc are fine. However, this recording is absolutely unlistenable for the strangest reason. It sounds like one of the performers is *sniffling* throughout the entire recording!"
1,Sent the wrong kit,"While I did receive a Monster Energy sticker kit, it is not the same as the one in the picture. The one I received only has 12 stickers on it, and their sizes differ from those in the picture. For the purpose i needed these stickers for, the ones received will not fit, and I am greatly disappointed. I'm sure I can have them replaced but I needed them for this weekend.The quality looks great as expected, and the shipping was real fast, but they sent the wrong kit."
5,An inspiration to EVERYONE!,"This book was recommended to me by friends in Michigan and it should be on everyone's bookshelf. Ike McKinnon's story is one of perseverence, dedication, and an incredible ability to remain above the fray and disease of society. It's pure inspiration to read about his life and how he rose above everything, not letting himself become tainted, to help people, help clean up the city of Detroit, and help straighten out its police department. It's motivational, inspiring, and Oprah should know about it!"
3,great book for a new Mason,This is a great book for a new (or old) Master Mason to read. Joeseph Fort Newton designed this book for new Master Masons under the Grand Lodge of Iowa - but it is in no way specific to Iowa.
4,The Builders is exactly what Masonry is about,"I was given a copy of this book when I first became a Freemason back in the early 1980's, I have read it and re-read it over the years. I always get something new out of it each time I read it. I often quote from it as Newton was a skilled writer on the subject of Masonry.I would recommend it to anyone be they an Entered Apprentice, Master Mason or someone thinking of becoming a Mason. The only secrets in Masonry are the business conducted in Lodge concerning the funds taking in and how the money is to be spent, other than that there are no secrets between Masons."
3,good despite chart failure,"Unlike ""Mountains"" and ""Girls & Boys,"" this video did not make references to the contemporary film ""Under a Cherry Moon."" It was another predictible Prince concert video. The extended mix includes Prince chanting dance commands. The title may sound violent to some now. However, the song deals with a man begging his lover not to leave him; he never threatens violence against the lover. This is one of the few Prince singles in which the B-side is not a non-LP cut. However, since both songs have videos, I think Prince was trying to jam two hits on one LP. This record may make many nostalgic for the late 1980s."
2,not very good,Rod Cameron was a fine cowboy actor in the 1940s and in the 1950s turned to television. This spaghetti Western from mid-1960s is fairly pathetic movie.
2,Kind of creepy,"I give it 2 stars only because it was free. The illustrations are poor, and the 'poems' are pretty awful. it says on the back cover, in all caps,""WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND"" I think that's pretty creepy for a preschooler's book. Clearly this is a 'traditional' family values kind of book, and doesn't come across as being very accepting. In it's favor is that it is easy to read, and the concepts are very clear, though sometimes a little weird."
5,life book for your young child,"I LOVE this book! It simplifies so many basic real life questions & answers for your child about all aspects of growing up, it is an excellent resource that i saw in a Dr.s office & liked so much I found a copy on amazon & bought one for my own children!"
4,"Beautiful, but not greatly presented as it should be","I am a really huge fan of Yukiru Sugisaki and finally getting her new series, Lagoon Engine Einsatz, in graphic novel format is a really treat for me. The story is really deep so it gets confusing from the beginning, however, they've included ""Einsatz Revealed"" to explain some of the keywords in the story to make it easier to understand. Sugisaki's artwork of course in here is really beautiful and has a unique look from her other series. However, one of the most disappointing thing I found (I own the first printing) was that the lineart were very pixelated, due printing error, instead of crisp line you would commonly find in the original tanks. As an artist, it really really bothers me to have to flip through the page, especially Sugisaki's work, pixelated. I hope the error has been fixed for the other edition...But other than that, I look foward to seeing more of her L.E.Einsatz."
3,Disappointed Doc Student,This book is too old and archaic. I was very disappointed in this book because most of the contributions were more than 30 years ago. One of the theorists even includes a theory from Isaac Newton. Isn't Newtonian physics behind the times?
4,A must have,"I have an entire shelf of fish books, and this one has been there the longest. It's great for quick references and is full of drawings of 100s of species of fish. A must have"
4,What a day!,"Virginia Woolf goes beyond merely describing the attitudes of a woman planning a party. Through social interactions and chance meetings, we meet a broad range of interesting characters struggling with the aftermath of not only life's decisions, but also the consequences of such societal ills as the Great War. The close of the book was an exceptional way to persuade readers to read more of Woolf's work, not becuase we will ever know what became of Clarissa and her lost love, but because we are intrigued by the life Woolf gives her characters in our own imaginations."
2,Hard to follow,"I began the book having never read anything by Virginia Woolf, but had heard she was great. I also had only heard of Mrs. Dalloway but did not know the story line. So, going into it blind I am certain handicapped my apppreciation for the work. Virginia Woolf uses eloquent words in Mrs. Dalloway. Unfortunately I found that it was a bit difficult to follow. There were several passages I had to read twice to understand where she jumped from one idea/topic/person to another. Half way in the frustration overtook me and I stopped reading. Having since seen the movie I understand the story much better and may give the book another go. If you do not already understand what is going to happen and are unfamiliar with this style of writing I suggest viewing the movie first."
2,A not all together awful stream of consciousness book,"Mrs. Dalloway is a book very much like James Joyce's ""Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"" which I can say makes it a hard recommendation. The point of view flows from one character to the next without any warning and many readers may be easily lost. I would not reccmond this as a first venture into the horridly confusing technique of Stream of Consciousness. Frankly, a knowing book editor would have helped this book a lot.On the upside, there are some very serious Sapphic undertones to the rambling of the book which make it more interesting than James Joyce whining about how he got beaten by the other boys in boarding school. But there are similiar themes of repression in the two books.The side plot involving Septimus Warren Smith and his wife Rezia was more interesting than Clarissa Dalloway and her silly party and repressed lesbian leanings"
2,"I wanted to love it, really I did...","Having abandoned this novel only half-read years ago, I went back to it hoping that maturity and experience might make a difference in my view of the work. Again I found myself plodding through, at least finishing it this time, but still left unimpressed. Sorry. I tried."
3,Did Not Enjoy,"I needed this for a class, but after a few other books that were offered, I had started this book pleasantly, thinking of course, that it was going to be entertaining.I can see why it was a classic. There are many underlying emotions within the characters, they are complex. It is a guessing game who has more power truly: the women or the men. And Woolf did a great job composing it.However, it wasn't hard for me to put it down; it didn't compel me to read further. The language didn't seem old, just dry."
4,flows smoothly from beginning to end,"What interested me about the book was the fact that it tied up so neatly, and also the fact that it really spoke to that one place in time where we mentally place oursleves. For Mrs. Dalloway that place is Bourton."
1,Like Eating Bran Cereal...,"If you have already purchased this book, use it as a means to prop up your lopsided sofa table, or maybe use a hardcover edition to hold open a window... whichever you decide, I would not waste my time reading something which was written, I believe, to impress rather than to relate. Kind of like F. Scott Fitzgerald's works... I just don't get it. DO read ""The Hours"", you will be impressed."
1,tedious,"I really liked the movie ""the Hours"", loosely based on this book, so I thought I'd read it... I couldn't get through it. I love many classic books, but I'll not try another by Virginia Woolf."
2,"I tried, and I'll try again...","I generally devour books, but it was a struggle to get through the first fifty pages or so of this novel. Primarily, I found the character transitions much too confusing. Perhaps I just am not a devotee of stream of consiousness, although I did enjoy Proust (but admittedly did not finish). I will try Mrs Dalloway again, but I am beginning ot fear this is a case of the Emporer's New Clothes..."
2,Too many run on sentences...in fact paragrapghs.,"I had never read Virginia Woolf and found her style...run on sentences thru the whole book for each paragraph with tons of commas difficult to read and distracting. In short, I personally did not care for her style but I think her subject matter is probably good. I might try her poetry ( I think she wrote poetry too) but I am very picky about fiction and writer's styles. I am a nonfiction...history and biographies...girl so perhaps that was the problem."
5,"""What a lark! What a plunge!""","These, Woolf's, words are exactly as I would describe the book. The delightful style encompasses something I never encountered before in literature. Virginia Woolf exibits two distinct voices: one almost flippant, and one rich, plunging into the depths of a woman's soul. Woolf allows Mrs. Dalloway (the clever title says it all about her identity) to portray the societal role that an early twentieth century Mrs. must fulfill, and the inner voice of strength that Clarissa Dalloway must have. The words are exquisite and Clarissa is just lovely."
2,Not a fan of Virginia Woolf,"I enjoyed some of the concepts that Virginia Woolf brought forth in her plot. I also her selection of word choices in conveying her message, that's what made it a powerful read. However, this was one of my least favorite books because of her chronic use of run-on sentences and poor transitions from one character to another. I realize that this is what makes Woolf unique (aka the ""woolfian"" sentence in modern literature derives its title from this structure), but it was confusing. While the story itself took place in one day, I think it took me one full day of reading and assistance from Sparknotes to interpret. Much more work than it was worth. If you need or want to read anything from Virginia Woolf, do not start with this book. Some of her other works would be suitable for the novice Woolf reader."
3,Gretta's Review of Mrs. Dalloway,"Mrs. Dalloway is a challenging book to read. The author Virginia Woolf, known to be one of the greatest american writers. Mrs. Dalloway is a sensitive lady who is going to have a party. Madly in love with Peter Welsh, but Peter has just gotten married to a girl he met on a boat. In this book you see many deaths, and you see how life was so hard to live. It was a struggle for these people to live and Mrs. Dalloway's life seems so empty. It is a classica novel. Although, it tends to talk more about one subject, and focuses on just one subject, it is still a good book to read. It is a short novel, but yet it has its hard parts to understand. Mrs. Dalloway could never do anything for herself until she has this party. She decides that she will buy everything necessary for the party, and here you start seeing a change in her life. For her this is the most important party of all time. I enjoyed reading this book, and hopefully you will too."
1,Help me!,I was happily grazing in the sunny uplands of my home town library when I was cornered by the insatiable Wolf. Come quick. I have survived the rapids of her flowing subconscious but am stuck in her growling semicolons.Help. I'm seeing light at the wrong end of the tunnel
4,mrs dalloway,"Mrs Dalloway is a book well written, it gives a very good example of real life. How people act, what kind of character they have.But my opinion is that it is a bit boring, there's no excitement."
1,Waste of a day,"I too read Mrs. Dalloway as a prelude to reading The Hours, which I want to read before seeing The Hours. I had read and enjoyed A Room of One's Own while in graduate school. To say that I hated this book would be untrue, because in order to hate it, something would have had to have happened. They say that Seinfeld was a tv show about nothing - well this book is full of sentences that are too long, characters that are never developed, and truly about nothing. Sorry, but just because VW was mentally-ill does not mean that everything she wrote was profound and interesting. This was just plain dull. I'm hoping The Hours is better, despite its inspiration."
3,somewhat interesting time piece,"I like the era it was set in. The characters were interesting. It was a book club choice, good discussion."
4,Great novel good notes,"Mrs. Dalloway is, of course, a classic novel and a great read. But enough time has passed that an annotated edition is useful. The annotations in this edition are well selected and generally non-controversial. My only quibble is that they would have been more convenient at the bottom of the page. I would also like to see a good edition like this available for the Kindle."
4,Mrs. Dalloway,"I would recommend this book to anyone. It is filled with romanticism and looking back on past relationships. It deals with death in a different perspective. Mrs. Dalloway shows that although life can be hectic, something good always comes out of it. This book deals with the past, present and what may take place in the future. Mrs. Dalloway tells that it is easier focus on the future instead of dealing with the past. This book also tells us the importance of how short life may be and how we need to spend every moment of it with joy."
2,Didn't like it...,"I enjoy reading classics, give me Thomas Hardy or Charles Dickens anyday, but I did not find the characters in this book engaging at all. I could not stand the snobbish attitude of Mrs. Clarissa Dalloway and that of Lady Burton. It seems I am in the minority here when I say that I positively find this book superficial."
3,Just Couldn't Get into It,"I'm embarrassed to say, I just couldn't get into it. Beautiful writing, but I was not in the mood for the triviality that is Clarissa Dalloway. I'm sure I'll read it some other time and love it."
1,Too many hyphens,The hyphens from hyphenated words that originally spanned two lines were not removed in this product.Product defective and almost unreadable (6 aberrant hyphens in one page!).I returned this product.
2,Bad editing,"I love this book, Virginia Woolf is one of my favorite authors of all times. But this Kindle edition is very poor. There are words with unnecessary hyphens, then there are pages with only a few words on it (in the middle of a sentence) and the worst was a RIGHT aligned paragraph. All of this made it a little hard to read the book. So, not the best Kindle edition in the world."
5,Woolf' Best,"For the longest time, I thought I disliked Virginia Woolf's work. Typically, I am not a fan of ""stream of consciousness,"" and being that ""To the Lighthouse"" was my first read, Woolf left me not wanting for more. However, in a Queer Theory course in my graduate studies, ""Mrs. Dalloway"" was assigned and I absolutely loved it. In fact, upon finishing this work, I ordered all of Woolf's works.Not only is the work hauntingly beautiful and melancholy, but also rather daring. The book takes place in the course of one day in London, yet somehow, the reader becomes familiar with lifetimes of relationships, some of them homosexual relationships. Woolf's work here is gorgeously poetic.The book generated a lot of discussion because it has so much to offer to many different kinds of readers. I once swore I would never read Woolf again, but this book has made me recant the error of my ways.If you are a fan of poetic prose, read this book. I intend to read it again and again."
2,Poor Kindle edition,"This Kindle edition is terrible. The margins change without rhyme or reason. Pages end in the middle of a word. Words are hyphenated for no reason. Given the complexities of Virginia Woolf's narrative, the formatting is particularly distracting. Buy another edition."
3,Expected More from this author,"Her phraseology is convoluted (maybe just this edition) and difficult to follow. Perhaps I was expecting too much. Story line was interesting, but her descriptions were odd."
4,don't be afraid of virginia woolf,"after having thoroughly enjoyed ""to the lighthouse"" i decided to try ""mrs dalloway"". many reviewers complain of the difficulty in reading the stream of consciousness writing style. although it can be difficult, it is simply something you have to get comfortable with. when you do, you will open yourself up to a treasure trove of great literature like ""sound and the fury"", ""ullyses"", & ""sometimes a great notion"" to name a few.of these ""mrs dalloway"" is one of the easier to read. ms woolf's use of language is unmatched. her characters drive the story, not the action. get lost amongst these and you will love this book. the book is also relatively short which will help the first time ""streamer""."
3,3.5 stars,"at parts it was flowing and captivating, and in parts totally obscure. i liked the asociative writing but eventually not much happenes. but its nice to read an intelligent author"
2,"It's dangerous to pan a classic, BUT ....","I read this book after watching the brilliant movie version of ""The Hours."" If that's your motivation, don't waste your time. My English teachers will cringe when I say it, but this book, well, sucks. It may well be great literature, but the characters are not engaging, and if it was Woolf's motive to out-do James Joyce in chronicling a day-in-the-life and in writing a stream of conscious narrative, she doesn't pull it off. Again, the characters and the internal mental life simply don't have the power that ""Ulysses"" has. Reading Woolf is necessary for a good eduction. I recommend, however, that you read ""To the Lighthouse"". I may still be motivated to read the book version of ""The Hours"" given how great the movie was. But my taste for Woolf is all done now."
3,Novel vindicated at the end,"My initial response of hostility, sustained through much of the book, mellowed some at the end. It is a sensitive story of love and madness, apparent mostly on afterthought. Still, I thought more of Faulkner than of this."
2,A day in the life ( I really dislike this book),"I read the novel ""The HoursThe Hours"" where the assumptionis that Virginia Woolf killed herself. I just read a murder mystery where the solution was very differentA Breach of Promise (William Monk Novels).I changed my ideas about this book as a result. It is no longer the depressingdeath anthem that the modern history gives us, but a life affirmation of a femalein a male dominated society that would bleed the life out of her for being different.I think this understanding fits better."
5,A family favorite for over a decade,"My family has been using this cookbook for about 15 years, and we all love it. My brother and I started using it as high school kids, and loved experimenting with the enormous range of completely different cuisines represented here. When we left home our parents gave us each copies of this book, and it's still a favorite; now my husband loves the Filipino egg rolls, and the authentic Ethiopian section brings back fond memories of time I spent working there.Over the years we've tried a high proportion of the recipes, and they've never failed or turned out ""wrong."" You will need access to some unusual ingredients, but many come in dried forms you could order over the internet if the selection in your town is limited. There's a helpful ingredient dictionary that suggests some substitutions. Any unfamilar techniques are explained so clearly, it's hard for even an inexperienced cook to mess things up. This is a great cookbook for any adventurous eater!"
5,Incredible recipes - I wish I had an International market!,"The Mexican section of this book is well worn in my house, even though I own over 15 Mexican cookbooks -- Jeff's just hit the spot. The Armenian recipes are wonderful, and my Armenia FIL loved the meals. The only sadness I have with this book is the Three Ancient Cuisines that are missing! I love to take a country and make an entire meal and my family loves it, too. I HIGHLY recommend this cookbook, which I can read like a novel."
4,Where are the English Recipes?,"How could a book on immigrant ancestors leave out the English? He covers Irish, Scottish, And Welsh immigrant recipes as well as recipes from many other cultures. Did all the English settlers become United Empire Loyalists and move north to Canada? I'm a Canadian and we ignore the English here as well. We have days celebrating every other culture except the English - Carribanna (in Toronto), Black history month, St. Patricks Day, Robbie Burns Day, St. Jean Baptiste Day (especially in Quebec) but no St. Davids Day (I don't even know when it is).It's a good book but I guess I'll just have to look elsewhere for recipes for bangers and mash, bubble and squeak, fish and chips, trifle, etc."
4,A great cookbook to have on hand for those 'what do I cook?' dinner parties,"I am the proud owner of every cookbook written by Jeff Smith. Frugal was what drew my attention and the Frugal Gourmet on our Immigrant Ancestors is worthy of every penny spent. The appeal of this book is the enticing photos and the wonderful history lesson that Mr. Smith provided for each recipe, granting the reader and the aspiring cook (that wants to provide something new and unique experience on the dinner table) a tale of the creation of the meal. He has insightful little chapters that explain Mexican, Korean, Welsh, Persian etc. food. Never is it just one recipe and your left looking for sides, Mr. Smith has always provided the entire menu for a great sit down dinner, and succeeds in keeping the meal as close to the original recipe of the country."
4,Good cookbook,"With my grandmother gone, I miss her cooking. I have some of her recipes and this book helps to add to Grandmother's collection. I love the different varieties of recipes from all over Europe. The Mamaliga recipe from the Romanian chapter is the main reason I bought this book. It's THAT good."
1,Soft Cover,Pleased with the book but was disapointed with the fact that I thought that I was buying a Hard Cover not the soft cover that arrived.
5,Love Sirius,I purchased this to have a second dock and it is so easy to move my radio from vehicle to vehicle.
2,Not quite what I was hoping for,The water streams that shoot up from the lotus head are often uneven and vary too much in height and direction. If any small piece of debris gets inside the lotus head it will jam one of the holes and send the water flying off in any given direction or just block it completely.Overall I would say its been a disappointment. The Sunterra site recommends a 450 gph pump for this head. I think that's a bit much as the water shoots about 4 feet up in the air. I bought the diverter valve to help lower the flow but then the streams all just fizzle out when you back down the pressure.They need to refine the holes to make nicer more even streams that will work at varying pressures.
1,JUNK,Re: Just a little luck by Janet Dailey. I was under the impression that this story would take place in WV. Not only did it not but there was not even a single mention of WV.Very very disappointed in this book. This was the 1st time I had used my kindle and I'm not sure if I'll be using it again if this is the kind of junk you end up with.
3,Fun flick,"OK, not the best in the world, but worth the purchase. Tons of silly dialogue, corny intros to the main characters (wait'll you see the stunt 'horse riding' antics), but the fight scenes are strong; extended in length, and choreographed very well. The finale is gritty, but without a lot of excessive melodrama. All in all, pretty good, but only when you have the extra bucks."
2,Shaolin & Wu Tang 2- Wu Tang Invasion,Well for starter i had this movie on VHS and i loved it the only problem with this movie. In the setting for the language it didn't let me prompt it to play audio for english. The setting was there but it didn't work and that to me was disappointing. For this was a great movie audio is really important we don't speak the language. The setting for subtitle work fine. I have to call you on this one not happy with that defect.
4,Good stories about frontier life,"While ""Magical Melons"" is not as good as its predecessor, it's a charming collection of stories that get into the lives of the other siblings and some friends of the Woodlawns. Although Caddie is still present, Clara, Tom, Warren, Hetty, and others get a little story as well.The book is interesting to a reader of more modern children's literature in its terminology, especially concerning Native Americans. But its heart is in the right place, and those who express negative opinions about the native people are shown to be wrong. The book is also somewhat religious, but not in a specific sense. Religion is just another part of the Woodlawns' lives, and the morals in the stories don't pound you on the head.I remember riding my bike 4 miles to another library to check this out when I was younger, and I still enjoy the stories today. Recommended reading for anyone that enjoyed ""Caddie Woodlawn."""
2,top had a hole!,"I brought two tops, but to my disbelief one of the tops had a small hole ( about the size of a pea ) in front!.I just want potential buyers to be aware. Otherwise it is a good buy."
2,Strap was twisted.,"This looked like a cute to and for $4 who could beat it. Well, I know why it was so cheap. Although it would have been really cute under a jacket or even byitself the one strap was twisted the wrong way so I had to return it. It could have just been a fluke and probably does not effect all of the supply."
3,Weird straps.,"The top material and color are like in the picture. The problem I had was that you can't really see in the picture that the straps are unusual. They are straight on the shoulder side, but are rounded out on the chest side."
3,"Stellar fashion advice for Big Gals, too much schmaltz","'Well Rounded' makes a good-hearted attempt to boost large women's self-esteem and fashion sense. I love the dressing advice -- finding a uniform and sticking with it has saved me hundreds of dollars and hours of frustrations.What I find annoying are the lame bits about self-esteem and accepting yourself. It's become a rote line in the emerging field of plus-sized books. Don't get me wrong -- I believe we need all the encouragement and support we can get -- but it seemed cookie-cuttered. It didn't seem very personal.If you're look for fat-positive stories of success, stick to 'Wake up!, I'm Fat' by Camryn Manheim. She actually explores her relationships, emotions and motivations more. But if you'd like some light-hearted fashion advice and some well-meant plattitude, then this is a good book to pick up. It has earned a permanent place in my library, but mostly for the practical fashion advice."
2,"Trite, contradictory, trendy and tiresome","As a fashion conscious lady with a lifelong weight problem, I'll grant that Catherine makes a few good points in the beginning - but her book will teach you nothing. It contains New Age nonsense that dictates ""weight loss comes from self-esteem"" - advice that one food pyramid is for everyone, followed by suggestion that the one adapt same old ADA food pyramid that so many of us find unsuitable - tired advice about wearing black and neutrals that's been in every book on the topic written during the past 20 years - and the underlying idea that a heavy woman can have any interest she wants as long as it's exercise."
2,Little of note here,"The fashion tips in this book are far from original. The tired ideas about wearing ""neutrals"" and ""the uniform"" have been presented in perhaps 95% of the books on this topic for the past 25 years. In fact, the truly fashion conscious among us are unlikely to find a wardrobe of black items and, of all things, white tee shirts to be appealing.Though, unlike many popular books today, Catherine's does not contain the ""poor mes,"" the trendy, boring ideas about ""self-esteem"" (and the assumption that one who is large is lacking in same) are totally stereotypical and tired. One wonders if those with weight problems (with which I can empathise, since it is a lifelong situation of my own) will not stop to think that few genuine difficulties in any life were caused by, or would be decreased by, anything connected with one's weight. It would be far better if Catherine had dealt with fashion in itself, rather than flavouring her work with pop psychology which falls flat."
4,Great Starter or even Refresher.,"I found the book an easy read and there were a few important nuggets that made the book worth the money. I have been selling for years and prospect and provide customer service via phone, but most of my 'selling' occurs in person. This book focuses on selling on the phone. Bly makes this distinction up front between telemarketing and teleselling, which I found helpful.If you are new to telesales and need help really putting some framework to your day, this is a great book to start with and then move on.The reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because there were no ""Aha's"" in it. But I will give it to my new salespeople and have them read it."
1,Impressive TITLE!,Impressive TITLE is ONLY what this book it is all about. The author Robert W. Bly begin terrifying the lectors by narrating negative remarks about our economic in general. Scaring the enthusiastic entrepreneurs to Fly Solo.
4,An amusing romp,"The Immis are a small people, compared to most, barely waist high on someone like us. Their men have the look of permanent boyhood; their women are curvy and compliant. The Immis' gentle hedonism gives them poor preparation for the acts of bravery. When a dark shadow falls across their land, the Immis draft Odkin into heroism and then exile him for the trouble that follows in his heroic wake.A great chef can built extraordinary treats from everyday ingredients. That's what Wood does here with staples of the fantasy genre. There are wizards, mucled heroes, grunting bad guys, and lots more of the usual. But, with Wood's enjoyable art and quirky spirit, the story steers well clear of cliche.//wiredweird"
4,slightly simple,"This album is a convergence of a variety of breakbeats and acid-oriented sounds, as the title suggests. As such, the tracks are quite similar to one another, never varying too far from this main theme. This makes for a good cd in the right situation... Otherwise the album is somewhat repetitive and at any rate is not the most complex of electronic music. It is highly danceable, and for the breakbeat fan this is definitely worth picking up."
4,Fat beats.,"Wow. I just got done listening to the samples. This compilation totally reminds me of being in an unbearably body-heated, suffocating-with-smoke warehouse grooving to the beats blasting out of a stack of bassbins in front of me. Trippy 8mm loops of black and white mickey mouse doing a dance similar to the running man on a cloth screen overlaped by colorful computer-generated animation of everchanging geometric shapes and colors. Can someone say flashback? Great music, especially for the oldschool brakbeat enthusist. Though I haven't noticed any mention about the album being continuously mixed. It deserves an extra 1/2 star if it is, and a full star if it was mixed with two turntables and a mixer!"
1,Poor rendition ....,"A very poorly conceived album, the guitar rendition was very poor, slow ( not according to original timing) and amateurish. A poor cd... not recommended for serious classical guitar players."
2,It is the Pimsleur Basic Japanese repackaged,The CDs and training are very good. A problem is that they are identical to Pimsleur Basic Japanese that I purchased four years ago. Verbatim these are the same CDs just with the word conversational instead of basic written on them. I think that I was deceived by someone in their marketing department.I returned for a full refund but that was a waste of time/energy/money.
1,dissapointing.,All i have to say is this movie was not very good period and even having Jessica Alba in it doesn't help as she's in the movie for like one scene that lasts maybe 2minutes. I'd pass on this movie.
2,Careers falling,"The story is a bit thin. Audie England's character (Eve) escapes from some kind of prison - the kind where the prison keepers don't even know who they're keeping, and the kind with a high-tech alarm system with more holes than a Swiss cheese. Even with that kind of start, the strain on one's credulity just keeps getting worse as the movie rolls on.The biggest attraction may be in the moments when Audie appears wearing only Audie - and I have to say she wears it well. Those scenes are much too brief to make up for the weaknesses elsewhere in the movie, though. I wouldn't run if I saw this movie being shown again, but I probably wouldn't pay much attention, either.//wiredweird"
1,Venus Rising,"This film was a waste of time. I skimmed through looking for someone I was led to believe played in it, but did not!I'd give it 0 stars if I could. The acting was pitiful, at best."
5,Better that the first...,"Running a little longer than the first album and ditching some of the bugs that slightly marred it (the strings being one), ""Into the Purple Valley"" shows Ry Cooder coming into his own. While tackling most of the same issues and types of songs from his debut, ""Into the Purple Valley"" takes a more direct and stripped down approach to the music. He also takes on a few more musical styles with the gospel influenced Teardrops Will Fall and the calypso flavored FDR in Trinidad. While people claim that ""Paradise and Lunch"" was his greatest album, this one, his first true masterpiece, should not be ignored and was certainly a springboard for his more delicious mix of musical variations."
3,"Awful Singing, Great Guitar","Whoa. I bought this album on the strength of these reviews and the 5 stars...but be careful, all is not 5 stars in the kingdom of Cooder. The reason you've never heard of this album is that while the guitar playing is impeccable, inspired and a mark of true talent, the singing is AWFUL. Cooder is almost tuneless and clearly has never learned how to sing. On tracks like Teardrops Will Fall, his back-up singers come in and really highlight how terrible his tune is. Consider yourself warned."
5,Very interesting book,"The book was great. It had great stories, humor and valuable information for everyone whether you own a business or not. Once I started reading I could not put the book down. Everybody should read it at least once."
5,Buy This Book,"If your students refuse to learn how important it is to focus on INDIVIDUAL WORDS-- if they insist on thinking that it is sufficient to 'get their point across in a rough way'-- if their sentences are as a result sometimes nonsensical, suggest this book. And then make them read it-- including the appendix at the back.Among other valuable aspects, the book uses examples of bad writing from famous authors-- simultaneously reassuring the student that a mistake can happen to the best of us, and reminding the student that vigilance is always necessary."
5,This is my favorite book in the world,"This is my favorite book. For years I struggled as a writer, unnecessarily as I now know, because I had never been taught the principles of clear communication.This book teaches those principles. I recommend it to any writer who is trying to improve his work.This book teaches a hard-core discipline of writing. To follow its principles will not only improve your writing ability, it will make you a better person."
4,"Worthwile, but . . .","Robert Graves was one of the best writers of his era, but as this book shows, he was also a Puritan when it came to language. While this book contains many useful tips, it is also pedantic and argumentative. As many of the reviewers noted, Graves and Hodges often illustrate poor writing with examples that seem, in an initial reading, to be sound. Perhaps this merely shows that modern readers are being anaesthetized by bad prose, but I don't think so. If Graves and Hodges loosened up a notch or two they would have written a much better book.The authors leave the topic of style a little too early for my taste, making the book more of a guide to editing than a guide to writing well.Still, the book focuses on developing a prose style that is logical, clear, and succinct--the backbone of all good prose."
4,estupendo,"Un libro escencial para reconocer a los genios del arte de vanguardia contemporáneo, a lo largo de sus páginas nos vamos sumergiendo en las claves necesarias para descifrar las contradictorias y a veces conflictivas actitudes de la vanguardia artistica del siglo pasado."
4,Mya back and better then before.!,"Okay there are alot of really good tracks on this CD,but the ONLY track I truly enjoyed on this CD was ""Case of the Ex"" the first time I heard it I was hooked and couldn't stop playing it.! ""Free"" is good ""Best of me"" is good,and that duet with Left Eye from TLC is pretty darn *GOOD* too.!The song I liked the least on this CD was ""Ride,Shake"" or whatever its called... It just seemed to drag on forever and it got boring fast... However if you are looking for a quality R&B album and a *GREAT* female artist whole will most likely stick around for years to come then pick up Mya's ""Fear of Flying"" its worth the money you spend.!Its worth buying for Case of the Ex alone.!I *HOPE* this reveiw was *HELPFULL*!!!!"
1,dissapointed,I must say this album is way under par to what Urbana-Champaign's reputation of music is up too. not only is it reocorded poorly but the songs are un-original and tedious and seem to suspiciously imitate Pink Floyd often. Singing is also annoying
3,Please enter a title for your review,"I think this is the best of Absinthe Blind's four albums, but I'm not really into it. I like a lot of midwest indie-rock, and these guys seem to have some grasp on the better elements of that style, but it rarely translates into great songs. I think the Pink Floyd comparisons are ridiculously ignorant and lazy. This music has no relevence to the 60s/70s psychedelic classic rock era. It reminds me mostly of The Sundays and The Cranberries, with occasional glimpses of The Smiths and Modern English, but less britpop than the first album. You could do a lot worse than checking out this album, but it's really not on the level of Braid, Hum, Joan Of Arc, Castor, or even Shiner."
2,fleece vest,"I have been looking for a purple fleece vest in the stores and didn't have any luck. Was very happy when I found one on the net.The vest is cut a little long, I am not a short person, 5'5"", but on the whole I am very happy with it.I originally ordered a X large and returned it for a large.I was very happy with the companies attitude on returning the X large."
5,PEARL,"My wife ,as well as myself, were extremely happy and satisfied with the Akoya Cultured Pearl. It was delivered on time and it helped to enhance a wonderfull Christmas.Thank you."
3,Conventional Wisdom,"The impact the aticles in this book have had are really quite remarkable. Included here are the articles that cemented the legend of the first 100 days of the FDR administration, the piece that set the belief that Sacco and Vanzetti were innocent dupes, and that Coolidge and Harding were total incompetents.Other reviews implied the articles here were written in the years they appear under but that's not correct. They cover events that somewhat center on the year they are dedicated to but include fore and after story and opinion. Really they represent prevailing thought of immediate post war years, the collection was originally published 1949.If you want to understand what people assume they know about the period you need to read this. But understand later research, from more conservative and liberal perspectives, have discredited much of this conventional wisdom."
2,Background Overpowering,"It would be great if Ms Smith could pronounce the words so clearly that you could understand the text. The poem is still part of the composition. The band comes on so loudly that she is second fiddle to them. They should accompany her , instead of trying to drown her out. This is common among High School Jazz organizations."
5,"Upbeat, sassy talent","I love this CD. The music is vintage best of the best, some of it written in the 1920s, but sounds just as good and on-topic today. The arrangements are fantastic, keeping the original feel and meaning but updated to appeal to the 21st century. I would have bought this CD just for ""One Hour Mama"" sung in such a saucy way by Lavay...and her band is unbelievable. This is a faster, more peppy CD than ""everybody's talking about Ms. Thing"", (the only other CD by L. Smith and her Skillet-Lickers that I've heard)."
1,Experts at fake reviews online,"We paid to hear this person in person based on the CD and it was a joke...she is not sultry, has no vocal training, moves around onstage like there are ants in her pants. Any success she has had is completely based on phony reviews online, check them out. When we saw them perform, the band was fine but when she came onstage, most of the people ended up walking out, it was just that bad and almost child-like. I would not purchase anything based on glowing reviews, always read the bad reviews and then weigh the comments because these 5 star reviews you are reading are simply not accurate. Buyer bewareUPDATE since i wrote this review the number of glowing reviews expanded LOL seriously people..sultry? legendary? comparing her to jazz greats? sweet holy moly if there was ever a case of phony reviews this place is it."
5,"Lavay, please, more","All I can say is I anticipate the next Lavay almost as much as the new Star Wars movie. Dear God, that's a lot. Please, Lavay, more.And if things with Chris don't work....I'd be happy to show you a good time if you ever come to Crawfordsville :)"
2,Buy the separate items you need,"I purchased this set for my first child and only ended up using the nail clippers and the thermometer. The nasal aspirator didn't work as well as the one provided by the hospital. The medicine dropper and spoon weren't useful because most infant medications bottles have a dropper included. The thermometer worked well but too quickly ran out of battery and because the battery isn't replaceable in this model I have to buy a new one. The nail clippers work well and we still use them.From my experience, I would buy an infant nail clippers and a better quality thermometer that has a changeable battery and skip this set entirely."
2,Needs Improving,"I used this text in an elective on electrical machines and found the book very difficult to learn from. Readability is not bad. The writing is fine and easy enough to follow but the equations in the text were frequently the wrong equation for the topic. Several tables had eroneous information. While most text books contain some errata, this book contained more than any of the dozens of engineering books in my personal library. None of the end of chapter problems had any answers in order to check work. While only a nuisance, example problems in the text would reference a machine from several chapters back, requiring the reader to flip back and forth to understand the situation of the current example. I did appreciate the fact that the book includes matlab examples and exercises as to aid understanding with simulations."
2,Not so good....,I have found many errors and omissions in this book and also in the student solutions manual. I purchased this book for an electric machines class at my college and now I have to look for supplementary material just so I can understand what the book omits. I am so tired of wasting money on poorly written textbooks. Maybe if publishers spent more time doing error-checking and readability reviews versus schmoozing colleges to mandate these books then we can get a better education.
2,Not Worth It...,"This cheaply made book may be able to claim that it contains all of Sorayama's images, but the reproduction quality is poor, on cheap paper, and many of the best images are split down the middle by the spine/seam of the book, making them look even cheaper than this book already makes them appear. Not worth your money, unless all you want are tiny lousy quality images on tissue paper. Sorayama deserves better."
5,A must have for sorayama fans,"If you are a fan of sorayama, this book is for you. If you are a newcomer, go with a larger book (Naga, torquere, Gynoids). The dimensions on this book are rather small, and the paper is not ideal. The overwhelming amount of artwork does, however, make up for these shortcomings"
4,Well worth the 20 bucks I got it for back in the day.,"Has a lot of pics. So many that each time I go through it, there are more that I do not remember seeing before (even googling etc for them). The pictures are not captioned so I cannot look up a particular pic name on the web for more info etc. The color is a little lacking, but for the original price it was well worth it. The paper is not a thick gloss paper like in an art history/ other collegette book which is one reason the color is not as saturated or vibrant as the original works. The book and bounding is more like a really thick paperback novel. This makes one annoyance where some pictures are spread across two pages and because of the way the book is bound you cannot open the book flat. Of course some of my more favorite pictures are smaller than others. It is not one pic a page. some pages have 4 pictures or so. If there was a follow up book that had Sorayama's works since '03 I would pic it while still in production."
2,Scalpmaster Economy Wash-clothes are not well made.,"The first time I washed the wash-clothes a couple of them raveled because the hems were too narrow. Another one raveled in the next washing. I use these every day. I have some that were bought as seconds that have held up for 5 years - better made and thicker. The seconds have finished edges rather than hemmed. I did not expect the clothes to be luxurious, but I did expect better than I got. Also, I resent them being foreign made - and not marketed as such."
1,Save your money,"These don't even make good rags , they are rough certainly not cotton or absorbent. Put t hem in the rags in the garage to clean oil and grease."
1,It's not white!,"I don't mind that these towels are very flimsy but what gets me is that they are light grey in color. I was expecting these to be white. I didn't care the quality because I only want to use it as a hot towel before dinner is served. But it's not white :-( so now I'm going to try to bleach it to see if this helps. It is not as fluffy as it looks on the picture. The towel is also very grainy, it is uneven in texture... Overall I'm not very happy and I bought 100 of them so I can give my guest a hot towel before dinner service - ARG!"
2,Poor quality - but meets my needs.,"These washcloths are of the poorest quality I've ever seen. They're rough and sparse in Terry loops. Luckily, they work for my needs but these are not choths for anyone who wants them for facecloths or company."
1,cheap dingy product,"I ordered these washclothes because I wanted thin ones, but when they arrvied, the quality was awful. The color was a dingy off-white and they looked used rather then brand new. This product is not worth purchasing regardless of the inexpensive cost."
4,Stock up cheap by buying in bullk,"There are 12 washcloths in each pack, so this is a great inexpensive bulk buy option. I bought these so that I could have a fresh washcloth each morning and night to wash my face with - and still only do laundry once a week. They are great for that purpose. They are just a little thicker than the hot washcloths the airlines hand out before meals. The cloths are fairly thin and a few have some strings hanging off the sides, but even with heavy use and frequent washing, none are unraveling. These aren't nice enough for the guest bathroom, of course, but they are perfect for my purposes. I just use once and throw into the laundry, all week long, and can do it again next week. Overall, I'm pleased. A very inexpensive way to quickly stock the bathroom."
3,Feels more like a shop rag.,"I am using them until I find better ones. Was not happy with the product but costs more to ship back. The company (voluntarily) refunded my shipping costs when I sent 3 stars as feedback. I thought that was fair and will improve the feedback. The company delivered on time, the product is just not what I was hoping for. They will make great shop rags."
1,never received it,"I like the product, if it ends up getting delivered. I ordered it over a month ago, and have never received the product."
5,love them,very happy with this. typical good senseo product. Works consistent and as usual comes out good. I wish they make these for a long time
2,for week coffee,Much to week ok for some one who enjoys vey mild coffee taste have to use two pods for a cup of coffee
3,Senseo Coffee Pods,"I would like to say I absolutely love the Senseo coffee pods: I love the ease and no-mess of using them as I love the Keurig ""cup"" pods I use in another coffee maker.However, I don't like the fact that I need to use two pods at once to get a decent cup of coffee, and even then the taste does not seem to be fresh and full bodied.Perhaps my mistake is that I ordered the medium rather than the dark roast. I will order dark next time.Also, I would rather like to purchase them locally rather than through mail order, but have not found a local source.Bed, Bath and Beyond (where I purchased my coffee maker) does not carry them and says that they can't stock them - perhaps because they carry very few makers requiring them. I have asked my local King Soopers to order them but they also say they cannot."
2,weak coffee,"While I enjoy Senseo-brewed coffee generally, the breakfast blend is far too weak. I might as well be drinking hot water colored brown. I recommend that either you tell the manufacturer to make it stronger or you advise your customers to brew it in combination with a very dark blend (like espresso roast)."
2,I love hazelnut coffee but. . .,"I was really happy to see this coffee for such a great price. I even got a better price using the additional Senseo coupon code.As soon as I got the pods I brewed my first cup of . . . ""the weakest coffee ever except for when I forgot to add the coffee to the coffee maker."" I was really disappointed.After reading the package I discovered I could use two pods to improve the flavor. Of course this also doubled the price making the deal not so good after all. Using two pods was a little too strong for my taste. Senseo rates the coffee as between mild and med. It was VERY, VERY mild!In all fairness to this product, I purchased these pods to use with my EZ-Cup in my Keurig. So perhaps they would make better tasting coffee in the Senseo pod coffee maker."
3,"Okay, but not strong enough.","The coffee has a great taste but if you plan to make more than a 6 oz cup it's just not strong enough. That being said, I have the Senseo that you can choose up to 12 oz cups so it's my fault for not thinking my purchase through. The medium roast is still my favorite."
2,Little Kona Flavor,"I had high hopes for Senseo's expansion into the world of Kona coffee, but I was quickly disappointed. There is very little if any real Kona flavor in these pods. Again you get what you pay for with the Senseo brand coffees (however I do love my Senseo machine )."
4,Coffee Pods,"This coffee has a great taste, for anytime of the day. The coffee Pods are alot cheaper then the K-cup. Give it a try."
4,Excellent strong coffee,"Just experienced a weekend of Keurig coffee. Watery compared to the Senseo. I actually like the dark roast better than this, but the rest of my crew thinks it's too strong. We drink A LOT of this in my office. Once you start with Senseo coffee the other stuff tastes like dishwater"
5,This is the best way to buy Senseo,I have very little choices of Senseo pods at our local grocery stores. I have been buying mine from Amazon because of all the choices. It is so easy and I get them right away.
5,Excellent coffee!,"I've had a hard time finding the original senseo coffee from grocery stores, they stock it, but it's always cleaned out soon after they stock the shelves. Got a bunch from Amazon and it's fresh and delicious. Excellent flavor and aroma."
5,Senseo medium roast coffee pods,"Great system for brewing your daily coffee, and the medium roast coffee fits my taste accordingly. I will continue to purchase this product from Amazon. It's shipped on a consistant basis each month."
5,Don't Purchase from Target,"This coffee machine is probably the best coffee maker I've ever used, so long as you use their coffee pods. I purchased mine from Target...what a disaster since they don't keep consistent stock of the recommended coffee pods for this coffee maker. I now purchase my pods from Amazon...they are dependable, in-stock and tax free."
3,Average Coffee for America,"I recently ran out of my Senseo Pads that I normally purchase in Germany. As I was going to America, I ordered it, thinking that since Americans love their Coffee (Starbucks etc.), this would be a premier product just as in Germany. Sorry to say it was not and tasted like average coffee. In Germany, Senseo coffee is the best and I have tried all the flavors including Decaffeinated."
5,Just Great Coffee!!!,I have been drinking Senseo Coffee since it was introduced (about 8 or 9 years). It is coffee the way coffee should taste. It is always consistent (never any surprizes). It is so simple to prepare and there is no mess. Ordering is so simple. A couple of clicks and the order arrives within a couple of days from Amazon.
1,Cancelled.,"Interesting. I received notice that this item was no longer available to me (subscription), but I get a ""review"" request after the subsription was cancelled by amazon. Now I have 2 Senseo units that I can no longer get pods for (I guess only from the mfg.) The cost is outrageous, and the coffee pods, although convienient, is just not that great. maybe 1 step above instant coffee...guess I am being forced to get a Keurig after all. Gee.. Nice."
2,Meeehhh not so good,"I'm really not a coffee snob and only drink about 1 cup or so a day but this coffee was not so great. I do not like strong coffee but found I needed to use two pods for an 8oz cup and it still had a ""watery"" taste even though the coffee in the cup was very dark and appeared rich tasting. I wish they made a reusable pod for my Hamilton Beach model #49970 so I could grind my own coffee. I cannot recommend this coffee. Very disappointed. I'm going to try a different blend and hope for a better cup of coffee to start my day. Boo-hiss on this one!"
2,Where's the hazelnut flavor?,"I wanted to try a flavored coffee pod for my Senseo machine. I purchased hazelnut and was disappointed that I couldn't taste any hazelnut flavor at all! It doesn't taste bad, but it tastes just like regular coffee with no hint of hazelnut. What's with that?"
5,Top Of The Morning,"Senseo has done it again with another fine product. Pod has a great tast, no after tast and is just what is needed for a morning cup of coffee to get you started."
3,So so compared to other Senseo coffees,I bought this new addition to the Senseo coffees and was a little disapointed. If you like a milder brew you may enjoy this coffee. I however like rich/bold flavored coffees.
5,A favorite!,"A favorite for my coffee-loving guests. While I am admittedly a ""tea person"", I cannot differentiate between the coffees that my pod machine produces and my usual coffee maker. A great buy! I recommend purchasing syrups as well. =DNote to any Senseo owners who are looking to create espressos: purchase the Coffeeduck espresso filter version via Amazon (rather than Senseo's version) and saved a bundle."
5,Senseo Breakfast Blend Coffee pods,"We have a Senseo single cup coffee maker. It's been difficult finding the pods that go with this unit so we looked on Amazon, and there they were! Even though our local grocery store now carries them, Amazon's price is still the best deal. We are on a 6-week automatic plan and it works out perfectly for us! When I think of all the money we spent prior to finding these pods on Amazon, I am even more determined to check Amazon FIRST before buying anything at a store. You just can't beat Amazon's prices!Senseo Breakfast Blend Coffee, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 4)"
4,Kona Blend,"Good for what it is, a quick cup of coffee with a slightly different flavor. The 10% blend isn't quite enough to really make a huge impact on the taste."
2,"Well, its coffee, but it sure ain't Kona","If you are looking for a Kona blend that actually tastes like a Kona blend, pass this one by. Maybe it sat next to a bag of Kona in the warehouse, but that's about as close as it comes.Kona is smooth, and never bitter. This stuff just tastes like an ordinary slightly bitter medium roast coffee. Won't be buying this again..."
3,Mistaken order...,"When an incorrect order of Senseo coffee pods arrived I opened a bag to try, thinking I would just go with it, and the coffee as labeled was fine...I just have an addiction to hazelnut, and I will probably offer the one that came to guests and friends who prefer the unflavoredvariety...I do appreciate the refund..."
2,Weak flavor,I a using these pods in my single cup coffee maker and if I could use 2 and not cause the water to overflow I would. This coffee is very weak.
4,So good!,I really like these coffee pods. They are tasty and not too bold. You just get the right kick without the bitterness of a dark roast.
3,Great Coffee,"I Love this blend, but not the small 4 pack..I will always try to buy the 6 pack when purchasing again, if available"
4,Delicious!,"I have been drinking Senseo coffee for a couple of years now, trying different kinds. The Sumatra is delicious; I believe the pods in general are much more flavorful than the K-cup options, which have become very popular now."
3,Nothing to write home about,"thought it was a little weak, like the dark roast better. Neither one is a great cofee."
2,Senseo Sumatra,I Didn't like this coffee. I'm used to the dark roast and this coffee is just too bland and weak for my taste.
3,BETTER BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH,"The Senseo, which is a great machine, has recently added some varietals to their coffee pod line. Although superior to their Dark Roast, it still doesn't come up to the standards of really good varietals or even the better Italian/French Roast blends."
4,My wife's favorite of the new blends,"We were glad to see that Amazon started carrying this Sumatra Blend. After discovering it in Europe and bringing several pacakges over, we later had some shipped to us from family in Belgium.This has a medium strong, less bitter, taste preferred by my wife.Recommended for any Senseo lover tired of the Medium blend found in the retails stores."
5,World's best coffee!,"This coffee is great! I can't usually find the flavored type in the stores and when I do, it is more expensive than online. If you want a fresh cup of coffee any time of day or night, put SENSEO in your cup!"
1,If you like generic coffee...,"then this isn't for you. Horrible after bite that gives it a unique flavor that I definately don't care for...not to say that you will not however. If you are in search of a generic oriented flavored coffee, this isn't the one to try."
2,TASTE,THE COFFEE MAKER WORKS FINE. I AM NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE TASTE OF THE COFFEE. IT TASTES TOO MUCH LIKE INSTANT.
2,didn't like taste,"I am a coffee snob, but someone had recommended this system to me. bought the coffee maker and the pods, and after trying it on and off for six months, gave it all away."
2,discontinued,I chose this rating because they quit handling this! And couldn't find any where else on line so quit using!!
5,senso coffees,"I love the convenience of ordering my senso coffees through Amazon. They always arrive quickly, and the price in bulk beats the prices in the stores hands-down. The only thing that would make it better would be for them to offer Irish coffees in packs of four. I'd LOVE that."
4,Senseo Sumatra Smooth Satisfying,"The Senseo machine is great. Sumatra is a better coffee than the dark roast. Next, an organic coffee? Always prefer organic."
3,Nice change of pace,"I prefer the Medium Roast Senseo Pods - but the Kona is a bold, flavorful alternative to the medium. I recommend the Kenya or the Sumatra as a change of pace,as well. The Senseo Dark Roast tastes bitter compared to any of these other blends."
5,Senseo - a nice smooth coffee,"I've been buying Senseo since I first had it in a casino about two years ago. It has a nice smooth flavor -- not like some of those popular overroasted ""burnt"" tasting products. I'm buying this on Amazon's subscription plan and will continue for awhile. My first order was offered at a wonderful price (a teaser?), but the last two orders have been comparable to what I would pay at the supermarket. I do like the convenience, however, of having it delivered to my door because it is not always in stock at the supermarket and I hate having to hunt down my favorite products."
5,"Almost the best flavor, # 2 in our book but tops!!","My husband loves this hazelnut senseo....he uses it absolutely every day, so buying it in quantity from Amazon is great. I would say the french vanilla tops this one, but just by a hair.Senseo Paris French Vanilla Bistro Coffee Pods, 16-Count Packages (Pack of 4)Senseo Vienna Hazelnut Waltz Coffee Pods, 16-Count Packages (Pack of 4)"
5,Coffee pods,"The individual coffee pods come in a variety of strengths and flavors. They work easily and well with the pod-type coffee maker. The cappuccino flavored ones were rather blah, but the regular coffee pods produced a taste that was full and rich. The price when shipping was free was comparable to supermarket prices."
4,Surprisingly good,"I absolutely love my Senseo, but the thing I had always been waiting for was options beyond Mild, Medium and Dark Roast coffee. Every now and then I need a different kick from my coffee and until now it wasn't a possibility.The Vienna Hazelnut variety is quite good for hazelnut flavored coffee. My personal taste typically doesn't leave much room for liking nutty coffees. However, I am forced to make an exception for this one. It doesn't taste fake or cheap like many flavored coffees do. I prefer the other two varieties of Senseo flavored coffee more, but that is not to say that I dislike this variety, it's really quite wonderful."
1,Expensive now!,"When in the hell did this coffee skyrocket it's prices??Previously we had bought some for the same price as all their other flavors (around 36 bucks or so).Now this medium roast is over 95 dollars for the same thing?? WTF?!This just totally stops me from ever getting this brand again.Heck, it's cheaper in the long run to switch over to another style of coffee maker (with the small cups)and forego this. I don't know what caused this price increase but I am willing to bet it will kill sales."
5,Great coffee!,"I buy this for my husband--a coffee fiend. He won't drink anything else since I bought him his Senseo coffee machine. My daughter, who won't drink anything hot, actually wants one of these machines to make this for herself. Go figure!"
2,Okay but there is better out there for less,"I used to have no problem with these, until one day on an impulse I decided to give Target's Archer Farms brand coffee pods a try (breakfast blend aka medium roast). They cost less, are bigger, individually wrapped and produce a much smoother coffee. Now I can't drink Douwe Egberts anymore and am hooked on Archer Farms."
5,Coffee Pods Are the Way To Go,These coffee pods are much easier to use than the minature cups and they cost about 30% less. They make a good cup of coffee and store well too.
3,A little weak for me.,the Medium Roast is a little weak for me. I am not using dark roast. Good coffee.
2,Get the dark roast instead!,"The Senseo machine shipped with two 18-pod samples packs, light roast and medium roast. Excited about my new machine, I brewed my first cups of coffee only to be disappointed, not by the machine itself (awesome!), but by the quality of the coffee. The light roast was so-so, and the medium TERRIBLE. I quickly ordered the dark to compare, and can now HIGHLY recommend the dark roast over the other two options. The dark also works the best in espresso-like brewing mode, using two-pods with the 1-cup setting. It's still not the best coffee out there, and I'm looking forward to comparing with the upcoming podhead.com pods."
1,NEVER RECEIVED!!!,Senseo Douwe Egberts Medium Roast CoffeePlease check your records. I have never received this merchandise. I have already written to Amazon requesting a reimbursement. Thank you.
1,Bad Price,Great product but a lousy price. The grocery store has the same product for $4.25 compared to $5 here.
1,Great Machine - Horrible Coffee,"These machines are great, unfortunately the coffee used in the Douwe Egberts pods is horrible. I was going to get rid of my machine until a friend brought over some different pods. I suggest spending a little extra money and buying quality pods - the difference is markedly different. I personally buy mine from www.familyroast.com as they have a cool story but lots of people are making pods that fit this machine now. For what its worth - I hope it helps."
3,Not a good batch,I usually love this coffee but it seems that I received a bad batch. My local grocery stopped carrying it so I ordered from amazon but this coffee did not have the wonderful flavor that I was used to. I'm putting it down to a bad batch but I will not be reordering.
3,The coffee tastes OK,"I would rate this coffee taste as average. It's really not bad and it's really not super. I bought the Senseo coffeemaker based on a recommendation in Consumers Reports, but they neglected to mention that the Senseo coffee brand was not being distributed anymore to grocery stores. At least I can buy coffee on Amazon, but so far I have found none of the types to be outstanding and the selection is limited. Maybe one of these days the Senseo coffeemaker will wear out and I can get a different brand."
3,It *is* a blend...,"OK for what it says. Smooth and tasty. I just like my coffee stronger/thicker than can be had with a pod machine and I'm not into the froth. ...But that is the machine, not the coffee."
4,SENCO COFFEE PODS,I have the coffee m aker and can't find Senco in the stores . I'm really glad that you have it and the convenience of having it delieved. I will recommed it to others. Lucille
3,Pod damage,"Coffee is yummy, better than Kuerig, but one of the packages was damaged and quite a few pods were cut open, making them unusable."
4,Finally some flavored coffee for my senseo,"The hazelnut flavor is a little on the light side, but thats the way I like it. It saves me some money on buying the flavored creamer for my senseo coffee. Now I just add milk and sugar and I'm set. I hope they will start making tea for my senseo soon."
3,Pretty good,"I recently tried Senseo's hazelnut, irish creme and french vanilla coffees. Overall the taste was pretty good -- rather mild. I didn't find any of the flavors that distinctive, however. Yet I still maintain that for a quick, easy cup of decent coffee, Senseo is a good way to go. And I'm the type that would rather drink flavored coffee than regular, so all else being the same, I recommend giving the flavor pods a try."
2,hazelnut didn't come through,As much as I have enjoyed senseo coffee pods the last 10 years.....the hazelnut was not as strongly flavored as I had hoped for....I was looking for the cappucino (which they still sell in Europe)...ray
5,Coffee Pods,"I ordered this item sometime in September, and I finally received it for Christman, and it was worth the wait! I would recommend this item only if you are not a coffee expert, the taste is mild, and it works for me because I don't drink coffee everyday."
4,Coffee Pods Good,This product met my expectations and worked well. Cost was a little on the high side. Would buy again if needed.
1,Do not fall for this,Only received one bag instead of 4 - I feel this was intentionally deceptive. It is complete rip off - Don't fall for it
4,Senseo Pods,"So disappointed - not with Amazon but with Senseo - as Senseo has discontinued the pods. The Senseo coffer machine is terrific -- never a problem, and the pod cost was very reasonable. What to do now??"
4,"Nice machine, good tasting coffee",Almost every morningI prepare a potfull of coffee. On the days when I just want a cup or two I use the Senseo. I'm not much for the coffee so thick that it can hold up a spoon. Senseo Breakfast Blend is just right. I enjoy the bonus creme it leaves after it steams a fresh cup. The little pod can be reused in the garden so zero footprint. What can you do with those little plastic cups from the other brand?
5,"Nice, full-bodied flavor in these Sumatra pods","We normally brew a full pot of coffee in our home each morning as there are enough coffee drinkers to make it worthwhile. But in the afternoon, sometimes one of us wants a cup and it is not worthwhile to brew another pot or grind up the beans to make a smaller pot. That's what we have our Senseo for. We keep a couple different kinds of pods around to suit various tastes, and this one suits mine.These are a little stronger, and more full-bodied than the basic medium roast Senseo pods, yet the flavor is not quite as acidic as their dark roast pods. I use one pod for a ""double"" serving (the button with the 2 cups), which is (I know) not the recommended way, but I still seem to get good results. If I happen to be making one first thing in the morning and need a little more strength, I will use 2 pods and press the double first, and then the single to get a slightly larger and stronger cup."
1,recieved coffee w/expired date,"I love this coffe but recieved it with an expired date, called customer service they sent it out again,and again it was expired."
1,No Expiration Date on the Package!,"We had been buying Onno Behrends teas for some time thenafter the last purchase we noticed that there was noexpiration date on the package. We contacted Amazonthey sent us new ones, but still no expiration date.We contacted them again, they contacted the importerand said that they won't be able to provide expirationdate for the teas.We consume a lot of tea and buy from all over the world.This was the first time we came across a packaged tea withno expiration date and these teas are produced in Germany.So, buyers be aware these teas might have been producedwho knows when? They may even be antique!"
2,Not what I was expecting,"I love Rose Hips tea. It is my favorite herbal tea to drink. I was so excited to get this brand of Rose Hips tea because of all the glowing reviews. I opened up the package and looked at the box of tea and saw that it also contained Hibiscus Flowers!!! I love Traditional Medicinals Rose Hip tea because it is just Rose Hips and nothing else. I made a cup of this new tea and was not impressed. I steeped it for 10 minutes, then added lemon and Agave just like I do with my other teas. There was hardly any taste! With my other Rose Hips tea, the flavor is strong. I think it is the Hibiscus flowers that change the flavor. I am upset that I paid this much for tea that I doubt I will use. In the future I will stick with the brands that I know and love."
3,"Ok, but too long",Interesting and intricate. Nice regurgitation of Roman sources.The ups and downs of the main characters were tedious.
1,"Great book, TERRIBLE EDITION","Do not buy this edition of the book. The print is size 8, the spacing is terrible, the font is unprofessional, and overall this looks like an amateur publication or a pirated copy. No legitimate company would allow for work this shoddy, I would like to think. The story itself is good, but do NOT get this edition!!!!"
2,What I think -,"I loved the book about the Roman Emperor Nero and the first Christians.This particular printing of the book is too small for people who have sight problems. Wearing my glasses helped little, so I re-ordered the book. The print was bolder and larger.Select the version with the illustration on its cover. Much easier to read -"
2,Could have been done in 150 pages.,"Spoiler alert. This will be a short review and the plot is as follows - Roman pagan is smitten by a Lygian queen who converts to Christianity. It takes him 300 pages to see the light and convert himself and another 200 pages for her to be rescued from torture and death by Nero and his evil minions. Thats it! 500 plus pages. All Christians are good, Almost all pagans (except one) are bad. Save yourself the time."
2,I Hate It When An Author Preaches,This book is one long sermon. Very tedious. Robert Graves' Claudius novels & Count Belisarius are much better books. I would only recommend this book to very devout Christians who tend to share Sienkiewicz's beliefs.
5,One of the best novels of all time,"Excellent novel describing the struggle of early Christianity under the tyrannical and mad Emperor Nero. It's also a beautiful love story, the love of a handsome but troubled Roman soldier who has to give up his old ways of thinking for a beautiful Christian girl. This book really makes you think and does a wonderful job of showing the contrast between the simple truths of the early Christians and the debauchery that permeates the word. Petronius is the most memorable character, with his sarcastic, dry sense of humor and his ability to control the vanity of Nero. One of the best novels I've ever read."
4,Catholic romance with lions,"i don't read romance and did not realize prior to reading Quo Vadis that it is primarily a romance. It is a romance of two lovers, a Christian gal who wins the heart of her pagan beau to the Lord. After intense suffering and many trials and tribulations. If you like romance, this is for you. I think it was about 150 pages too long, however. Nonetheless, I appreciated the author's deep respect for the faith of our Christian forefathers."
5,"If you are looking for a good historical book, this is it.",I read this book from cover to cover several times in my life and it always was a pleasure. Reading this book I always felt as being there. The book is based on history of our civilization and it will give you an easy way of studying it. If you saw the movie you will be surprised how much you missed.
5,Great mattress!!!,"I have had a wonderful experience with this mattress that I bought a couple of years ago, and I am about to make a second purchase because I loved it so much, and I happen to be in need of another King size bed. I was very pleased with the company's delivery and packaging of the mattress. As well, I always have good experiences when dealing through Amazon. The company itself I did not have to personally deal with, as everything went so smooth and the bed is almost 3 years old now, and is holding up very well, just like new!"
4,Still charming after all this time ....,"This one is a winner. The script is bright, witty and romantic. Fonda is so cute you can't decide whether to kiss her or kill her - but it works. Mildred Natwick steals the film from the younger set as Fonda's widowed mother, every scene she is in is laugh-out-loud funny. Dated, yes - 1967 New York. In a way though it almost plays better with age. If your a New Yorker or New York fan, it's a hoot to look at the city scenes from then. A true feel-good comedy. Highly recommended."
3,"Love, laughs, and cold feet!","This is among the many filmed plays written by Neil Simon, and one of the best. I must own that in his work I would like to see Simon get laughs by introducing a few more comic situations and perhaps be a little less reliant on his patent New York one-liners--the kind that go along with a TV ""laugh track""--although few are better at it. For all that, ""Barefoot In the Park"" is nonetheless undeniably enjoyable (if a bit slow-starting), funny, and peopled with amusing characters. The cast is first rate, particularly a young Robert Redford in a polished comic performance, and the movie-stealing Mildred Natwick and Charles Boyer as victims of one of comedy's funniest mismatches."
1,I thought...,"... that with Jane Fonda and Robert Redford in a Neil Simon's play there would be some entertainment. But, because of (and no thanks to) Gene Saks' unability to be a real director, the result was pure crap, no matter how hard the leads could try : they were not given a chance. We must consider to be very lucky his output was so tiny.....The least Neil Simon could do would be to give excuses for helping the production...."
3,Barefoot in the Park,"Great movie but as far as the DVD goes, their mouths and voices were not matching up. Was disappointed but watched and enjoyed anyway."
5,Very funny.,"I love this movie. Robert Redford, Jane Fonda, Mildred Natwick and Charles Boyer all give great performances in this Neil Simon story directed by Gene Saks. Redford and Fonda play newlyweds trying to live in an impossible apartment in a 6-floor Greenwich Village walkup. Redford is rather conservative and Fonda more of a free spirit--until the tables turn. The dialogue is hilarious. This is definitely my favorite Redford/Fonda teaming (they've done three, so far), and one of my favorite Robert Redford movies. I think you'll like it."
5,She got on my last nerve!,"Jane Fonda is a great actress, but I have to admit that she worked my last nerve when she was whining about her husband's prudishness and demanding a divorce.Robert Redford was a delight as a young husband trying hard to please a dizzy wife. The other characters, such as Jane's mother, the telephone man, the old delivery man, the eccentric ""55"" year old neighbor, were also fabulous.Great romantic movie - you will laugh out loud."
5,Barefoot in the Park,"This movie is about a young lawyer who marries a young spirited, flighty, spontaneous woman. They get an appartment that is five flights up. Shortly after the honeymoon is over they come to realize that marriage is not all roses after all. It takes the mother and the corky older neighbor to help them through their differences. That and walking barefoot in the park."
3,Good Timing,I ordered this dvd and the quality was great! The seller sent it in a timely manner too which made my day.
4,A Pleasurable Romp through the Park,"I thought of this movie often while living my first 6 months in Vilnius in a cold, dank apartment, impatiently waiting for Spring to arrive. I finally broke down and bought ""Barefoot in the Park"" on DVD and wasn't disappointed. This movie has aged well, thanks in large part to Jane Fonda's wholehearted performance. Redford, unfortunately, looked sadly out of place. The movie bounces bouyantly along on the strength of Jane's indomitable will, aided by wonderful performances from Charles Boyer and Mildred Natwick. At film's end you wonder why Corrie still has anything to do with her deadbeat husband. Redford looks positively goofy dancing barefoot in the park, but you just have to imagine he has a good heart."
3,Shipping was a hassle,"The product was fine, in new condition, the price was good, but for some reason the shipper chose a shipping meathod that I had to sign for. Since I'm at work when the post office delivers mail I had to go to the post office to get it. I only ordered online for convenience since it was available in several local stores for about the same as the price plus shipping. One bookstore that sells it was closer than the post office with more convenient hours. My suggestion to the seller: Send it priority mail with a tracking number, but don't require a signature."
2,Vapid and hard to sit through,"This film was entertaining for the first five minutes and then it became almost tortuous to sit through. It is so vapid. The couple is severely mismatched and you actually end up hoping that they don't get back together in the end because in the long run, they lawyer especially, would be better off without such a dingbat woman for a wife. Now both of the lead actors are in their prime in this movie and they are both very good looking. Robert Redford bears an almost uncanny resemblance to Bill Clinton, although, even better looking. Jane Fonda does well in her dance routines. But truthfully, I see little reason to even bother with this film."
2,odd format,"DVD was formatted for use in Europe. I was able to change some settings to play it, but it wasn't what I expected."
3,"Pleasant, yet disappointing film","Having played Velasco in my local community theater productions of BITP, I was curious about the movie. Unfortunately I was rather disappointed. It's still the same sitcom plot, you have to accept that, but opening it up destroyed the magic for me. In the play you never see Velasco's apartment or the wild restaurant. They're just talked about, and your mind has to create them.The other major problem is the casting of Jane Fonda - WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! She just doesn't display the zaniness required for Corie. Her deep assertive voice makes her seem like more like a corporation exec than a 60's housewife. There was another actress at the time who would have been perfect - Goldie Hawn. However, the other actors are terrific."
2,meh,The show was only okay. I have seen many of Neil Simon's works I felt they were all okay shows an this fit all of his others. The show was well acted but I had little interest in the character's success
5,Review of Perfume,This was one of the first perfumes I was ever given and ordered this again from amazon because I ran out of the first bottle I was given. I love this scent and this was a great price! I would highly recommend it.
3,NICE PERFUME,THIS PERFUME IS VERY NICE BUT IT DOES NOT LAST VERY LONG. THE ONE GREAT THING ABOUT IT IS THAT I BOUGHT IT ON AMAZON FOR 50% LESS THAN THEY SELL IT IN THE STORES.
1,High Strong Note Reminiscent of Hairspray:(,"I bought this perfume based on the great reviews and I really like B-Brit, but when I received it and put it on there was a high strong note I couldn't quite place, it was very like disinfecting way up in my nose (but I Am very sensitive to perfumes)kind of reminding me of final net hairspray (Too Bad)I'm glad I only bought the sample I am going to try this from now on, saved me a-lot of money if I would have bought the full bottle! and also to flowery for my taste I like a more clean smelling scent."
1,SPURIOUS & FAKE,PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR. THEIR PRODUCTS AND SPURIOUS AND FAKE. I ORDERED A BURBERRY WEEKEND PERFUME FROM THEM AND WHEN I RECEIVED IT I FOUND THE FRAGRANCE TO BE DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT FROM MY PREVIOUS BOTTLE. IT WAS LIKE WATER. WITH THE FRAGRANCE LASTING FOR BARELY FIVE MINUTES. PLEASE CHECK YOUR PERFUMES AND FILE A CLAIM IF YOU NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE.
2,Too potent,I found this scent very strong smelling and overwhelming with only a spritz. Reminds me of the Lamp Berger gardenia scent....not a fan. I won't be wearing it again.
2,fake,I was wondering...how can be half price...now i know ...is just different from my previous bottle; smells last for 5-10 minutes...so please save your money..don't buy it ...is fakeshipping fast ....but .... :(
5,excelent,Gorgeous item. I love it!!! cuz it's a perfume that is expired in Mexico. The fragance is amazing and the bottle id
4,Sweet Deal,This product works just fine and for what other identical items costing 3 to 5 times more I got a good deal. Its not the best quality but does the job at a fraction of the cost.
5,TOP GUN QUALITY BOOK,This is a book that you won't be able to put down & will want to share it with others. The author's first hand experience as a Naval Aviator is portrayed at the top gun level!
3,Nice product but doesn't last long,"The product is fine, but the amount is not that much... And iwill have to find something else to use.The consistency makes it difficult to deal with. It is very thin, so dipping your finger inwill low only so much,perhaps an applicator or a different venue like a squeeze tube would be a good idea."
2,Disappointed,"I liked the book but I ordered the AUDIOBOOK. I sent an email to notify that I had not recieved the AUDIOBOOK, recieved a return email stating that it would be sent out immediately. Unfortunatly I recieved yet another paperback book. So Just gave up and kept the book."
5,Right Hand for mom with three kids,"I could not imagine living without this product now that I have one! It keeps my frozen foods from the grocery store frozen for hours! I can go grocery shopping and then leave my food in the hot car while I run other errands with no rush. Soccer games and T-Ball games are so easy now that we can keep all our stuff Icy cold on hot days. Vacation's and long road trips are a breeze with this cooler. We pack drinks, popsicles, whatever! In it and because it is a soft side it is easy to fit into tight spaces. Not heavy and bulking like the other coolers. This is a MUST for any MOM! we are going to Disney World this month and I don't have to worry about not having a fridge in the hotel room! I have a POLAR BEAR!"
5,Best cooler on the market!,"This cooler is amazing. I used it last summer for keeping foods cold while traveling with my daughter from the midwest to the East Coast and back. It really kept the food cold, even when locked in a hot car in the middle of summer for several hours at a stretch. Since then, I have been using it daily for my lunch box, to keep foods cold during the day. I highly recommend this product!"
4,good cooler,"bought this cooler to use as a lunch box and it works great, I left things in it over night and it still had ice in it after more than 24 hours"
5,Best Ice Chest,Great ice chest it really does keep ice for 24 hours in HOT conditions. Does not leak or sweat. Completely does what it says it will. Worth the money if you need to keep things cold for an extended amount of time.
2,Just one year old started leaking,"I liked this cooler until last weekend, when I found a wet spot under it on my car's rug. Should still be OK with blue ice."
2,Way too small for a 12 pack!,"A twelve pack of what I am not sure of, 5hour energy drinks possibly. If you froze a twelve pack and no ice and stretched the zipper to the max, maybe. Threads are already starting to fray, zipper pull has pulled out. The side zipper pocket can barley hold a Cliff Bar (flattened out by the end of the day I might add). Opening the thing is a pain empty, full is a workout. Why is there an identical cooler on this site for $10 less and a different name? Not sure but it more like a promotional cooler you get at the company picnic, while the boss get the Rolex. Do not waste your money. The other reviews must be from relatives of the guy selling these promo coolers as the next best cooler. I was a sucker, don't follow my lead or you will be one too. I would give 1 star but it is a cooler."
1,"Very dissapointed in this, built well but too tough to use!",I was very excited to order this to bring lunch every day and liked the fact it is so durably made but the issue is that the top of the bag is so tight that opening it and putting in some lunch items is a struggle. I wish this case had a top that could just be opened and left open. This bag reminds me of those little coin purses that needs to be flexed to be opened. I am sorry but this case feels bullet proof but it seems very small for a 12 pack to me and just a major dissapointment. I feel like it would be useful for bringing 1 sandwich and soda. Trying to stack up containers was not easy at all and the bag filled too fast. I bought another popular bag that is smaller on the outside but much roomier and more convenient on the inside. Really wish I had not made this purchase but don't want to deal with shipping it back.
4,Two Inches Taller For A Bottle Of Wine,All n all a fine bag but why in the hell couldn't it have been just a little taller to let me pack a bottle of wine standing upright?!? I have to lay it flat or at an angle.
1,Must have gotten a bad one,I bought this cooler on the recommendation of a lot of kayak anglers who think it is just wonderful. I must have gotten a bad one because it won't keep ice frozen for more than a couple of hours. By noon on a midsummer day I have a cooler full of water.
1,Terrible cooler,"Contrary to the picture, this product is QUITE narrow and stiff. This means I cannot put many items in this cooler. Most of my Tupperware will not fit because the cooler is too narrow. The instructions say fill it with warm water and then drain. I did this but the cooler is still VERY stiff and it is impossible to put anything in this cooler that is bigger than say 5"" square.Bottom line: do not buy this product."
2,"They keep drinks cold, but ...","They leak. I've had several of these. They are great if you need to take a cooler in a place that coolers aren't allowed because they look like a piece of luggage. But they don't stand up to daily use. The lining gets holes in it and leaks. If you were going to use it on special occasions, they would be fine. They do hold ice for a long time, even in hot weather. We got a lot of positive comments on the looks. It works best with cans. Bottle caps will destroy the lining. Don't bother to email customer service. They won't answer you."
3,So stiff can hardly use it,"This is my second Polar Bear cooler, same size, same type. The first one I used for years, carrying it to work because it doesn't look ""unprofessional"" like a lunch box does in my line of work. But this one is SO stiff you can hardly pry it open to get stuff out. The other one was not. Not sure what they did to the outside material; it looks the same but it won't loosen up, even after putting hot water in it.These do keep things cool a long time, so I'll at least give it a 3 star. . But my other one started leaking after a year or so, so the inside isn't that durable. The outside however, could probably stop a bullet!"
5,works well,keeps my lunch cold all day. works so well I bought 2 more. i used the 48pack size on a 5 day camping trip and had to replace the ice once
4,Big Hit,"Great gift for the boater/beachbum/outdoorsman you know. Got this for my Dad a while ago, and it is still going strong. He uses it all the time! It is a good size because isn't too small to be useless, nor is it too big to be a handful."
3,"Super cute, but falling apart already!","I got this Lamb Chop puppet for my 7 month old daughter after she fell in love with one our friends have. It's super cute and looks just like the one from the show I grew up with! It's a little difficult to make the mouth move, and within a month my daughter ripped off one of it's hands so now the stuffing is coming out. It would probably be better for older children who play a little more gently with their toys."
3,Lambchop,The puppet is cute as all get out. However if you have large hands it won't fit or perform well.
1,Had terrible dry and itchy scalp AFTER this relaxer!,"I've always had problems with flaking and dry and itchy scalp after getting relaxers, so I hoped that this relaxer (which says it's supposed to relieve dry and itchy scalp) would be different. It wasn't. In fact, my scalp flaked like crazy and was very itchy and dry about a week after getting this relaxer.Affirm is no better than a box relaxer bought in the store. I won't be buying again."
5,A must listen must learn guy,"Clementi. The first time I heard him, was by Horowitz means. Them, suddenly, a piece of orchestral Clementi at Radio Suisse Classique; and a new universe opened to me. Muzio Clementi. What a beautiful composer. Buy the whole symphonies. They are gorgeous. He's the guy. That's it."
2,Too much talk,"This video had lots and lots of talk and very little action. My son was bored with it and I was, too. I picked up a few things from it, but on the whole, it was not geared towards little league pitching. I'm not quite sure who the intended audience was."
4,"Familiar songs, wrong names","Play this through my car stereo on a memory drive, and the name of the song is always different than what is playing. Distracting. Went to my computer and renamed them correctly, but still doesn't work. I just ignore the screen display.Some of these songs sound like they were recorded by a handheld device in the middle of the audience: Poor voice, but loud orchestra."
2,I was disappointed and expected more in-depth information.,"I expected a more comprehensive list of equipment available with some sort of rating system or consumer comments. Comments from the ""mailbag"" are mentioned in certain occasions but not with any consistency."
1,THIS BOOK IS OUT OF DATE AND USELESS!,"The problem with this book is that the information is not in any coherent pattern. If you are interested in a particular type of equipment you can't find where it is located in the book! Also, the few areas I was able to find that were relevant to what I was looking for were totally out of date. The equipment Mr. Harrington revied had been discontinued by the manufactuers! I found this book a USELESS waste of money."
5,Excellent guide,"I work in a planetarium and I am continually asked questions about telescopes and accessories, especially from people contemplating that all-important first telescope purchase. I recommend this book to visitors all the time, because it is thorough, easy to read, accessible to people at all levels of interest and expertise in astronomy, and--last but not least--rather witty. This is a terrific book. I'll never buy another telescope or accessory without it."
2,okay,I found that I did a lot of skipping. I liked the hero but the heroine mostly annoyed me. I didn't want her to end up with the guy. I would not recommend this one.
4,I'm glad I don't put too much faith in others reviews,"I almost didn't read this after seeing some of the reviews. I am glad that I changed my mind. This novel was great. I can see where people complained that the romance wasn't really steamy. There maybe was only 6 pages of romance (sex) in the book. So if you are a die hard wanting to read sex scenes every few minutes, this book is not for you. However, if you want to read a great book with a group of fun loving eccentric characters, this book is for you. I thought it was a great book. I don't think Kelly was overly whiney (Maybe a tad but... - it fit the character), but Seth was perfect. I also liked how she added characters from her other books also. It was nice to read about Corrigan again. So if you haven't read this book, don't go by the reviews on this page. Pick a copy up yourself and maybe read a chapter or so at a bookstore. If it grabs your attention read on - I am sure you will enjoy it."
4,Laugh Out Loud!,"I thought this book was great! Not a lot of heavy romance, but lots of zany characters and laughs. It's not often that I laugh out loud while reading .... Kelly's a ""normal"" person attempting to deal with her outrageous relatives - pure entertainment. I liked it."
3,"Just ""OK""","This book could have been so much better. The characters were well fleshed out, but seemed to be existing separately. Kelly's relationship with her family was very special and worth reading the book for. However, her relationship with the hero was not well formed and, frankly, not at all believable. This is a good book to read when you have some forced waiting time; doctor's appointment, long airline flight, etc."
2,Funny story but the romance left much to be desired.,"If you like a wacky story line you'll love the cast of zany secondary characters in this one, unfortunately, the romance isn't nearly as interesting. The heroine is whiney, selfish, childish and very difficult to sympathize with. Seth, the hero, is terrific though and he so deserved a mature, loving woman to spend the rest of his life with. Instead he got Kelly and I nearly wanted to tear my hair out! END"
3,Kind of confusing...but sweet,"throughout the book i felt overwhelmed by the constant verbal battles that seemed to have no point. the pace was very fast and sometimes i felt i needed to stop to catch my breath. i agree with the others when they said there was no definite plot. i couldn't be able to describe it if asked. some parts i understood and found sweet and charming. the cover of the book caught my attention intially and they are right when they say don't judge a book by its cover. oh well, a lesson i learned."
3,"Ok Lock, keys don't work super smoothly",The lock is fine as far as your average ulock. I don't think it will be easily compromised by your everyday bike thieves. My only qualm is that it takes some effort (not alot just some) to get the key into the lock and the bottom part of the lock doesn't smoothly slip onto the top. It all works just fine with maybe just an extra 5 seconds of effort. I might spray it with some WD40 just to make it easier though
2,Bracket mount sucks,"The lock is OK, but you have enough frustrations in life without having to play with bracket mounting screws that are just a tiny bit to short. Another 1/16th of an inch would have made all the difference. I guess if you are King Kong you could squeeze to post clamp tight enough to manage a few turns into the nut, maybe, but why bother? Just buy Kryptonite. If you think I'm being picky, consider: if they can't get something that simple right, what else did they mess up?"
3,Fanciful Fiction,"The title should suggest it all, book for sale discussing matters that would never be put into print by the people discussed -- i.e. hand-book. There were some interesting anecdotes and kinda interesting reading about BDSM, but should be considered complete fiction or fantasy novel."
5,Interesting topic great way to learn about Leather scene,Was recommended to me and I enjoyed reading this version of the Handbook. Learned a lot and it gave me a new appreciation of the scene and history also.
4,If you can handle the lingo go for it,"The Leatherman's Handbook is truely remarkable. This book being published back in the 70's, has some strange lingo. I found it to be a bit funny myself. This book uses stories to illustrate the chapter topic. For a portion of the chapter Larry talks about the topic and then goes into ""story telling"" mode. During the later he tells of expriences he has had in relation to the topic. Lots of good information here and gives a good look at ""Old Guard"" thought.If it weren't for the lingo I would give it a 5 star rating."
2,just a clearing house,"I ordered a passage set of Baldwin. What I was sent was a keyed lever that wasn't even of the Images ""Wave"" family! When I wrote them I was told all of their Baldwin products were keyed items. (why list passage sets then?)In their defense I was refunded very quickly once I sent a picture of the item sent and a photo from Baldwin's website of what I had actually ordered.Lesson learned. Buy hardware from knowledgeable lock suppliers. (Unless you aren't in a hurry and if you don't mind the extra work when you are sent an incorrect item.)"
5,Good Historical Comparative Analysis of knowing,"Grene is a good writer with a great mind and takes command of her subject matter.A great text that explores the grappling of former philosophers with the idea of knowing the real world. If you have a modicum of philosophical history and an appreciation for the struggle to explore epistemology, then this text is highly recommended.Marjorie Grene is the philosopher behind Michael Polanyi's opus Personal Knowledge. If you are into Polanyi's epistemological view, then this book is a must."
2,Surprizingly pleased...,"Several weeks ago , I attended the Long Beach Blues festival. Linded up for the afternoon was Jimmy Vaughn, Koko Taylor and for a real treat at the end of the day, two guys named Diddly and Berry. But among this royalty was Lucky Peterson. This dude put a smile on my face and a dent in my wallet as I picked up four of his CDs on the way out. A true showman of monumental propotions, I would recomend this gentleman to any lover of the blues and boogie."
3,Mistake in Table of Contents,"I agree with the previous comment (Platon), except that there is a serious and confusing mistake in the Table of Contents where it lists ""The Art of Controversy (also known as Counsels and Maxims). They are not the same, and ""Counsels and Maxims"" is not included here. The other editions so far do not have TOC's that can be used to navigate the text. This is the only edition I've seen so far where the TOC let's you navigate the text."
5,Great Thin wallet,I really like how thin this is compared to what I was using before.I haven't used any other thin wallets to compare it against.If you put too much cash in the upper and lower bill pockets it gets a bit too thick with the overlap. I tend to keep 1 bill in the lower pocket to help keep me from spending it and it works well
5,Dont seem to feel it in my pocket. 4.75 stars actually.,This is the thinnest wallet you can probably find out there. Really thin and holds a lot of cards. Brought down the wallet from almost 1.5 inches to about 1/3 inch now. Particularly like the big pouch where you can put a whole A4 sheet folded 2 times without worrying about it falling out or making the wallet look bulky. The only thing i am missing is the space for those coins.1/4 star less for the fabric - it is too thin and crumbles while i put it into my pocket and sit on it for the whole day. Fabric is supposed to be pretty strong. Bug time will tell how strong it really is.
4,Happy with Product,"I have had this wallet now for a little while and yes, it holds many plastic cards as it says and maintains them very well as far as thickness it is Great !!!.... the material of the item is slippery like a parachute type material .....but I am happy to say I am pleased with the product....as far as durability it is yet to be determined but appears to be of decent quality !!! Overall, I would recommend this product !!!!!!"
1,Disappointed,"I had to return it because I felt that the design was poor. Although the fabric of this wallet makes it quite thin (and seemingly flimsy), when I put my cards in it it was just as thick as my original wallet but the cards were harder to access."
1,Cheap product,It's a pity Amazon allows items like this one - a joke on the buyer. Product of such extremely low quality that doesn't deserve $0.99 price. It is impossible that five stars reviews of this product were given by actually satisfied buyers.
1,Worth 1.99 (maybe) not 19.99,"This is the cheapest possible piece of nylon (or similar material) sewed into a wallet shape. You would never buy this if you saw it in a store. It is a rip-off at this price. Amazon should be ashamed to carry this item. If you have a sense of humor, you will laugh, then get annoyed. Otherwise, you'll just be annoyed. How this could get good reviews is beyond my understanding."
1,Save your money and buy something more substatantial,"This wallet lives up to the claim of being a super slime wallet. The layout of the pockets is good however that is where the benefits stop.Issue 1: The material that it is made of sounds like a potato chip bag. every time I move, I can hear the wallet make a crinkling sound which is annoying at least and embarrassing to more realistic.Issue 2: The slick nature of the material makes it so that the cards do not seem to want to stay put. This is not a good thing to have cards falling out while trying to make a purchase.The only reason that I didn't return the one that I bought is that I'll use it for a pattern to make one for myself out of a better material (probably denim).In short, I can't recommend this to anyone."
4,Billfold Wallet as Billed,"Very thin and practical wallet. Nylon version less expensive than the leather one and much lighter. Buy leather, if you want to make a fashion statement, as the nylon is not very stylish."
2,ehhhh not quite.....,"Length:: 0:08 MinsMy review is simple..just look at the picture on my vid of the what they have on the product's container...even worse is once you put in several bills, it wont stay folded! Funny, my leather wallet does...and whats best about leather is that it forms/molds around to the contents inside after a while...Maybe there is no replacing leather or ""leather"" wallets...only exception is a zip enclosed type of wallet/coin purse, that way you can fit it very easy when ever you go to amusement parks, beached, etc..."
2,Very Cheap & Flimsy,This is my first review and I feel compelled to leave one. This may be the worlds smallest wallet but it also looks and feels like the worlds CHEAPEST wallet. It is made of a plastic jacket type material like you would wear in a rainstorm. I really don't know who would want to use this wallet. It also makes noise when you use it like its a paper bag.
4,Thin and comfortable,"I've had this wallet for about three years, and it's been generally very good. It is as thin as advertised, which I like very much. My only complaint is that credit cards fall out of the card pockets too easily. I've developed a workaround: I usually add some paper, like an eyeglass prescription or auto insurance card, to each of the pockets to keep cards keep from sliding around. This does not add much bulk overall, but it keeps the cards in place. The company should rubberize the card pockets to stop slippage. After three years, the seam stitching is beginning to fray, but I think that's to be expected after so much day-in day-out wear."
3,"Thin, but won't work for most","I hate fat wallets! I'm always taking mine out of my pocket and setting it on my desk,car,etc. This wallet is definitely thin, and I've used it for several months now, but I'm now looking for an alternative. There just isn't enough secure storage space, no pockets that close. I don't carry much, but the few things I do have fallen out numerous times, and the credit cards are loose in their spots (unless you have 5 or 6 in each area to make it tight). I lost my atm card a few weeks ago. If you carry NOTHING but credit cards and cash (and are willing to keep an eye on your credit cards when you open the wallet), this may be for you. I'll be looking for a wallet thats still thin, but can store things a bit more effectively."
4,It's thin,"It feels funny and it's noisy and it will take a bit of getting used to, but it's thin. Really thin. If you're worried about your credit cards falling out because you don't have six for each compartment, cut a piece of cardboard to 6cm x 8cm and put that in behind three or four cards. This tightens up the fabric around a smaller number of cards and secures them quite well."
1,If I wanted to use a bag of chips as a wallet...,I would spend the $.50 and buy a bag of chips. This thing crinkles like a chip bag and feels about as durable.
2,"Thin, and that's it.","This is definitely much more thin than your regular wallet. If that is all you care about then you would rate this a 4 or a 5. However, it sounds like you have a crumpled up diaper in your pocket. The material makes a strange crunchy sound in your hand and in your pocket that really can't be ignored if you care at all about that sort of thing."
3,Misleading photo description,"Hi, the item was shipped as promised, feels very nice and seems well designed and manufactured, but it is NOT the wallet shown in the photo. Actually is another model from the same vendor.I am very dissapointed. Cant send it back because does not make sense as cost issue.Please Amazon, be more carefull"
1,Is this some kind of joke?,"I bought this after reading a review of it and when I got the wallet, I couldn't believe my eyes. It's clear that the vast majority of reviews you see about it on the internet are by people hired to post good reviews.This is the biggest rip-off I've ever seen. $22.50 for this? A little piece of rip-stop worth 2 pennies?? The cards slide around in the stupid thing and fall out when you open it and paper bills don't fit neatly.. it's ugly looking, it sounds stupid and no normal man would be caught dead bringing it out. Total junk."
3,"slim, but not the toughest wallet ever","I've had this wallet for a couple years. I received it as a gift from my girlfriend. At this point looking kinda shabby. Still works and all, but just a tad worse for wear. On the plus side, it is very thin. It is also not made of leather - so if you are a vegan, or simply don't like the idea of having the skin of a previously live animal in your pocket, this might be appealing to you. Personally, I find it kinda cool in an alternative way; I kind of just wish it came in cooler colors, like hot pink and neon green.I keep my wallet in my back pocket and it has been wearing out the back pocket in my jeans. This is typical -- not something that just happens with this wallet.I was looking for an alternative to a typical wallet (something that wouldn't wear the pockets out of my jeans so quickly when I stumbled upon this wallet and decided to review. Procrastination is the name of game, and I'm a pro."
5,husband loves this,"My husband wore out his first one of these after using it for several years, and I recently bought him a new one. He loves the wallet for its ability to hold a lot of stuff and be really compact, since he often puts his wallet in his back pocket."
4,Car Cover Lock,"I purchased this cable and lock for my S2000's car cover. I bought a $300 cover and oddly enough it didnt come with anything to lock it to the car. The product is exactly what you would expect, a coated steel wire cable and lock. The lock and cable probably could be defeated with some heavy duty cutters but that's to be expected with any of these products.Pro's: Affordable, seems durable, comes with three keysCon's: Strong cutting shears would probably cut through this if a thief was so inclined."
2,Keys are tiny good luck not losing them.,The lock is sharp and is uncomfortable to handle. The key is tinier than the tip of your index finger. I almost lost one already. Because the key is so tiny it makes unlocking this difficult. I much prefer the master lock key and cable.
5,Authentic historical fact,"Stephen Knapp presents historical facts as they are. He does not distort them or color them with false beliefs or opinions.True scholars know that the Vedic Sanatana Dharma is the original true religion and that Samskrta(sanskrit) is the mother of all European languages including English.That being the case, it behoves us to read this book and understand what Stephen is really trying to say."
1,ancient aliens is more factual,It is more likely that modern Brooklyn culture was a global entity than Vedic culture. 100% fiction written by a knownothing
3,Question For Dr. Newbrook...,"""One fairly typical case involves the name Australia, which is a modern coining transparently derived from Latin, where it would mean 'southern' (land, etc). On p 76 SK states that it is from Sanskrit Astralaya, meaning 'land of missiles'; he suggests that the pilots of vimanas practised firing their missiles in Australia, thus creating the deserts! This is just not true""This is just not true... don't the authors have the same right to say it is true as you have to say it is just not ture?"
3,Origin off word Australia,"I agree with Knapp. The word Australia denotes a land lying to the south. If man is at the northern pole, he sees the sun rising (only once a year) from 'south' - this is a geographical fact howsoever wierd it may appear.B.G.Tilak who wrote the 'Arctic Home in the Vedas' has explained in his book how the words Australia - Eostra - Ushas (the goddes of sunris) are related. Further only man at north pole would see the Ushas or Eostra rising from 'south'. Hence the origin of the word Austr."
4,"Intriguing, easy read but evidence is ?","An interesting story of the Indo-European language originating within the Pakistan-India region then spreading throughout Europe. This origin is a plausible hypothesis, but confirming evidence is missing. True, Sanskrit shares many words with most European languages, and Sanskrit is an ancient language but is Sanskrit closer to Endo-European than any other language of Europe? A conventional hypothesis is that Indo-European originated nearer the Caucasus region; though evidence for this is not conclusive."
3,Drop B.G. Tilak and P.N. Oak stuff to get credibility,"The book's value is unfortunately degraded by using pseudoscientific interpretations from people like B.G. Tilak and P.N. Oak with their nationalistic agenda. To publish anything available and let readers figure out what is true is not the way to write serious books. And I guess this topic needs serious treatment. Sadly, this approach is not helping the promotion of glorious Vedic past, rather the opposite. Why not stick to the many amazing _facts_? I like much better Devamrita Swamis' ""Searching for Vedic India"". Hare Krishna."
4,Knapp is doing what no Hindu has not done!,"It is Stephan Knapp as usual, thorough in his research, comprehensive and makes you wonder how he thinks like that.Looking at the title, the first impression is ' Is Mr Knapp overdoing it? Is it another cock and bull story?' But after finishing the book one will certainly consider possibility and Hindus like me will believe it. Knapp is doing to Hinduism, what no Hindu has done. I hope his passion for the study of Hinduism becomes contagious."
2,Waste of money; Stryer main text plenty good enough,"This book doesn't give you any extra information, and is as thick as the stryer text itself. I found it a waste of my money and don't want others to make the same mistake. If Stryer is the textbook you are using, it will be more than sufficient for your learning needs."
1,An utterly useless supplement.,"This book follow's Stryer's book parallel and tells you ""Next, Stryer desribes...and then he describes...and then he goes a little deeper into..."" It is rather ridiculous that this book is at least as thick as the main text... DO NOT BUY THIS. It is completely unnecessary to own, apart from answering the few problems from Strye's book."
2,Disappointing,"I previously ordered ""Farm Boy Tom's"" DVD from this producer and was very happy with it. This one was disappointing due to poor production and editing. Also, the model is uncircumcised which I find off-putting. It would be nice if the quality was consistent from one to another of this series, but it seems from my experience and other reviews like it is hit or miss with this producer."
5,the legend goes on! Ny the Statlers brothers,"I am looking for the Legend Goes On! Especially ""I don't know WHY? is the Song I really LIKE! a CD Or Even a cassette tape if that's it?Thanks for any help! That song I heard on YOU TUBE & IT's beautiful!I heard it was redone in the 90's?"
2,Not Impressed,I'm disappointed about this cymbal. Just over a year and have to replace it because it cracked. Going with Zildijian A Splash got much more out of the last one I had.
3,Itch...........,"Ok so I'll admit that what attracted me to this book was the fact that I am a Poison Ivy survivor. Anyone who has lived through the two to three week nightmare of poison ivy will agree that for the rest of your life a certain amount of fear lives in your psyche, of ever becoming infected again. So that was what prompted me to pick the book up. It was an interesting read, including the little personal stories related by other suffers. I will however say that this book had nothing new to offer short of perhaps, that certain toilet seats made in China could give you a case of Ivy rash as they are lacquered with a plant which is similar in make up to Poison Ivy. Good luck if you have the rash, I myself recommend spending a lot of time sitting in a hot tub, or if you can swimming in the ocean, since those are the only two things that seemed to give me any relief. Oh and keep telling yourself it will only last three weeks."
1,bad looking book to start with !,"IT,S MOST LIKELY A GOOD BOOK . I,LL NEVER REALLY KNOW BECAUSE AMMZON SENT ME A USED ONE ! I DON,T REMEMBER ASKING THEM FOR OONE ? BUT IF THEY SAID I DID ,THEN SO BE IT .BUT YOU,LL HAVE TO ASK SOME ONE ELSE ABOUT IT .MY BOOK WAS TOR UP .. TAPED UP BIG TIME . PLASTIC WRAP HOLDEN IT TOGETHER ! IT WAS NOT GOOD .I WON,T BE BUYING ANY MORE BOOK REAL SOON FROM THEM BECAUSE OF THIS ! I REALLY DON,T REMEMBER ORDERING TRASH TO READ AND SOME PAGES MISSING I THINK ? SO CAN,T GIVE YOU MY WORD ON THIS ONE .ASK THEM MAYBE THEY HAVE A GOOD ONE THEY MIGHT SELL YA .I JUST DON,T KNOW .OK BY NOW FROM WESS"
1,Minnie Bruce Pratt is an extraordinarily irritable person,"I admire Leslie Feinberg a great deal. Hir life hasn't been easy, but ze's managed to handle herself like a real gentlewo|man.As for Minnie Bruce Pratt, she seems to have a chip on her shoulder. When strangers eye her, wondering what sex Feinberg is or what she sees in hir, she thinks it's grand fun. I remember quite clearly an anecdote she tells about a self-defense class she once took: the teacher told her not to worry if she couldn't bring herself to hurt him because most women have a hard time overcoming their nice-girl training at first, and then she nearly broke his kneecap.I think Pratt loves the hostility Feinberg engenders more than she loves Feinberg, and I didn't enjoy her (temporary vicarious) company."
5,Great Memories,"I was lucky enough to go to Tokyo Disney Sea in January and this CD has brought back so many wonderful memories for me. All of the songs are exactly as they are played around the Park, and the Indiana Jones suite is the soundtrack playing during the ride. The music is very powerful and features English lyrics. The tunes are very catchy and resemble famous marching tunes, however there is also a classical element on the CD. Overall, it is a wonderful buy - I'm so happy I found it!!!"
4,Tokyo Disney Sea CD a must for any Disney Fan,"The music from Tokyo Disney Sea surprisingly contains a lot of lyrics. The songs from each ""Port"" remind me of the old attraction songs from when Epcot first opened such as ""Tomorrow's Child"" whereas recent U.S Disney attractions and lands have just a musical score. The songs from Disney Sea are not as cheesy as those old Epcot songs and definitely give you an audio feel for the park's themeing.However, the strongest tracks are the ones that are lyric-free. The best are The Stormrider Suite and Journey to the Center of the Earth. The Indiana Jones music is similar, if not an exact duplicate to the music available from The Official Album from Disneyland Park.Overall, its a great buy."
4,misprint,Those last songs are a misprint. I have the CD and those Warrant songs arent on it. Not that Im complaining. Just letting y'all know that that is a misprint on here.
4,Reflections From the Edge,"Disclosure: I know this photographer and have a number of his works displayed in my home and certainly cannot claim to be unbiased. That said: This is not a book full of ""pretty"" pictures of boy toys. These images don't glamourize the coupling of gay men. They do haunt, shock and cause the viewer to wonder about the lives of ""others"" who may not have the same comfort or ethos as we, but whose humanity can still reach us despite our lack of contact with them in our protected lives. Badertscher brings a discerning eye to the subject, having what is clearly a familiarity with his ""models'"" lives and desires. He gives us a glimpse of those at the edge (or are they?) This book is a jewel at a ""bargain"" price."
3,Not That Special,"This book has some value but very little. I have to questionthe photography skills of the photographer. True, most of the novelswere far from pretty--which is a minus--but that's only the start of the problem. Many of the poses were awful; the only poses that impressed me where a series of mirror shots, but they would be a lot more impressive if the photographer were not preasant in them. I was not impressed at all by a great portion of the end of the book dedicated to reverse negative photographs; a cheap affect that loses any goodness in the actual picture. And for how in ALL demensions (thickness, and most notably the hight and width) this book is truly a [not worth] the price asked. The shot on the cover is one of only two I found to be excellent, and of only three or four worth anything at all. Don't waste your time or money with this one."
1,y.......a.........w...........n..................,Tiny & trivial book. Don't waste yr time on this little excuse for a book unless it's the only book around on a desert island and you just have GOT to have visual stimulation whilst pleasuring yourself. Your fantasies would likely serve such purpose much better.
1,Disjointed collection of documents and PK photographs,"Considering the author was an officer and probably one of the better soldiers in the SSTK division this book is a huge disapointment. Ullrich's book consists of nothing more than a collection of maps, documents, and Propaganda Kompanie photographs that do little to explain history of probably one of the most remarkable and controversial divisions of the Waffen-SS. Karl Ullrich was with the division during its most critical engagements but provides the reader with no useful information or insite into the fighting qualities, organization or personalities of the 3 SS Panzer Division.I would recommend this book if you are only interested in pictures of SS men and SS equipment. As a historical document it leaves much to be desired."
5,footprints along the shore of an incoming tide.,"Its often hard to put into words one's relationship with self and God and our reason for being. The longing for love and the moments of pure grace that fill our hearts, with the simplest of joys that remind us of the unjourneying I need to take in order to feel God in my being.This book evoked a deep sense of gratitude the words and images it created, short stories and poetry stirred my heart with an understanding of our deepest yearning. Thank you Janaka....."
5,Just what I was looking for..,"Perfect, it is just what I was looking for. It helps keep me warm when working out in the cold or when hunting.."
2,"Quick delivery, but shemagh bleeds green when wet","SecurityPro was very quick with their delivery and the item is as stated and pictured. It works well in keeping me cool while in the sun. I have only used it in the heat; I wet it down and wrap it around my head and neck, facemask usually down. My main problem with it is the material leaks lots of green dye. I have handwashed it half a dozen times, let it soak overnight a few times, run it through a washing machine four times (once accidentally with other clothes which are now a dull green), and it still bleeds dye whenever its wet. I would buy from SecurityPro again in the future, but will definitely be steering clear of the 8537 Green/Black Shemaghs."
4,Utilitarian,"Army Universe fulfilled my order quickly. The sand color fabric is definitely not a top-quality weave but it will do just fine, I don't think these things are intended to last more than a few years of light but regular use and and maybe much less under heavy use. In other words, it's as disposable as a mens cotton handkerchief. For the price it's a fine value. This one does measure 42x42 inches. The first thing you might want to do is go all around the edges and make sure each knot is tight; they are not there just for decoration. If the knots are allowed to untie the fabric will start to lose its weave. It came with no country of origin label or statement, has a strong ""I was born in a textile factory"" smell but clean, and no instructions so I'm off now to ask the Interweb how to properly put this thing on."
2,Doesn't hold up well to daily use,My big issue is with the spine; it separates from the binding too easily. I am only half-way through my current notebook and have had to tape the binding in place.
2,Not for 1st time skiers,"This video is not for people with young children. I bought this video with the idea it would give beginner tips. It didn't! It did give bits of information on equipment, turns, and racing, but never mentioned stopping. I think stopping should be the first lesson taught. In my opinion, this video would be good for someone at least 8 years old who has taken some lessons and wants a review before they hit the slopes."
2,VHS To DVD,"As expected, I wish I could have gotten this movie for cheaper. If I could have gotten this for cheaper that would have added a star. I got this because I thought this was a far better movie from the jacket."
1,You gotta be kidding!,"Okay, I'm at a loss. How did this book ever find a publisher? This story didn't make sense. I cannot believe a novelist cum screen writer would be picked to star in a major Hollywood picture just because her and the male lead have a heavy make out session during the screen test. Hollywood does not work that way. If Smith wanted us to believe this unbelievable series of events then she should have addressed it more.The plot was trifling and the couple doesn't make love until the last few pages of the book. Before that we are led on this tired cat and mouse game between Brian and Alexandra. What was up with the epilogue taking place decades from 1995? It was ludicrous. I should have listen to another reviewer who warned readers not to pick up this book. When I found out my library doesn't carry the book I thought it wouldn't hurt to take a chance and buy it. Oh lord, was I wrong! I will donate this to my library. Please take DO NOT buy, you'll just waste your money."
1,Trite...complete and utter trite,"This book came recommended to me by a friend who knew that I was writing a book about an interracial couple. After listening to her high praise for the book, I was pretty disappointed when I actually began reading ""Kiss of Life"".The story's premise is unrealistic--I don't buy that a reknowned movie director and producer would stick a novelist with no acting experience into a major film production as its star; the writing was awful--flat descriptions, lackluster character development, cliché-ridden dialogue, an overabundance of adverbs when a simple adjective would have sufficed...If you want to read a good I/R romance, then this is not the book for you. If you want to see how *not* to write one, then borrow it from the library--don't waste your money on this one."
4,Pastor,Powerful prayer insight of how Christ followers should give themselves to prayer a a priority in ones life . Men should be leading prayer in the churches today. No prayer no POWER.
2,Not what I expected,120+ pages of simply restating that ministers should pray and not just study. That's it. The entire book! No suggestions on how to pray or how a layman should approach prayer. Very disappointing.
5,A professional and useful reference,"Tillman does his usual superb job. He knows more about naval aviation history than anyone. I bought the book as a reference, but anyone will find it easily readable as well as complete. Superb illustrations as well."
5,light-filled sweet restful sleep,"A friend of mine told me about this product, and that testimony encouraged my purchase. This CD is comforting. I play it at night at a low volume (set to repeat), just as I am going to bed and while I am sleeping. It lulls me into a light-filled, sweet, tranquil, restful sleep, and then a veil is lifted. My dreams are gentle and clear, sometimes wondrous and magical. I feel this CD's music invites all of that. Sweet Dreams!"
2,Bit of disappointment,The first two books of this trilogy were action oriented and interesting. The Earth Goddess was chocked full of religious and scientific theories but became very boring and tedious. I feel the author also became bored with this book and the ending killed the spirit of rebellion in Paulo. That was a let down.
3,Informative but fluffy,"Blacksun stresses the need for overstatement when writing your rituals. This makes sense for ritual purposes but unfortunately he also overstates anything he says in the book. There are some good points in there but they are buried unders layers of superfluous banter. I much preferred Watson's anecdotal approach in her Practical Solitary Magic, it just felt more real to me and I was much more interested. This is not the book for you if you already understand how to make up your own rituals, it doesn't even really help you refine the technique very much. I'd say it's more for the person who has immersed themselves in the religious side of the Craft and now is taking a first side int practical magic."
3,What Just Happened?,"I just finished this book. I've read the entire series up to this point in order and I truly enjoyed it. But I'm disappointed in the way this book ended. It was abrupt and left a lot of things unanswered about the lives of these people that I had become so engaged with. This is the first book of the series that had serious need of better copyediting, as well, to the extent that it was disruptive to the experience. The whole thing has a feeling of being rushed and it's disappointing. I have the final books in the series here in my shelf, and I hope that they are what I expect of this writer and this series."
5,Fine writing,"I love all of Griffin's books in his Brotherhood of War series. He has humor, and excitement. Men who know the Army will recognize a lot of the situations. I sit and laugh a lot while I read them. I have read most of them 3-4 times."
3,Disappointing,"The book doesn't resolve anything -- and doesn't complete the story. Read the last few pages, put it back on the shelf and go home.You'll be happy you did."
2,Mandatory predictable completion of the series,This series of books started out with the very good The Lieutenants and The Captains was pretty good as well but then the characters became stuck and did the same things again and again in each of the succeeding books.
4,Another Good Book,"This is another good book by WEB Griffin, it took me 3 days to read it, once you start to read it. You can't put it down"
5,ABSALUTELY A GREAT BOOK byHorsegal,"This is such a great book. I could read it a hundred times and not get sick of it.It's got so many facts about racehorses that I never knew.I liked Dark Secret's story.Moiffaa stort was one i never heard of before.Troublemaker's story was so sad.So was Dark Secrets.I liked hearing about Fair Play.I couldn't find a book about him until I read this book.I love ManO'War,War Admiral,Dark Secret,Exterminator,Seabiscuit,Troublemaker,Tom Fool , and all the other ones.This is such a great book about history horses.You can learn alot from this book.I sure did.I love everything about horses .I even like ugly looking horses.Their all special.People shouldn't take horses for granted.After all horses did so many things .They pulled logs for houses , they helped build railroads,they dillivered amunition,and they helped in the wars.This is a special horse book. I've read a lot of horse books so I would know.Anyone who likes horses should read this book."
3,my least fave from mj,"this is my least fave from mj.man in the mirror,the way you make me feel,leave me alone,liberian girl hold up but this album just lacked edge for me.dangerous makes up.but in a strange twist the songs have really held up.for me his vocals weren't as strong.but like i said dangerous made up for that.but he is the still the baddest out there and he will reign again."
5,The greatest white rapper of all time!,Eminem and Vanilla Ice have nothing on Micheal Jackson.He is the greatest white rapper ever.Everyone should buy this album if they want to her some true gansta rap music.Micheal is hardcore gansta rap.He makes N.W.A look like Milli Vanilli
4,The downfall of Jackson,"""Bad"" is the downfall of Michael.The first single,""I just can't stop loving you,""was refused by Whitney Houston and Barbra Streisand.Siedah Garrett,who sounds so much like Michael on the record,was fantastic.Siedah wrote the greatest song, ""Man in the Mirror."" This is the only cut from ""Bad"" still played on radio stations.""I have to give Michael alot of credit for singing this song,about changing yourself first.I did enjoy this album,but hardly ever play it anymore.This would be my last Michael Jackson record.I still liked some of his singles released,like ""Jam,""but never bought another CD."
4,"""Bad""","This album had the anxious fate of following ""Off the Wall"" and ""Thriller,"" which are two of the most important records in recent memory. ""Bad"" has often been seen as vastly inferior to Jackson's previous work. On this album, Michael Jackson leapt into the role of the writer/producer, which may explain why it might not function in the constantly intense way that the two polished records before it were."
5,super fast,Thank you soooo much!! I was super excited to give this to my boyfriend for christmas and it came is super fast time and in great condition!! Thank you again!
3,Complimenting TT,"I have been trying to learn what happened to Tatiana Thumbtzen, the girl who was in ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" I thought she & Michael made the video lighthearted and fun."
2,His Best Album Since Thriller!,"Okay album, but not groundbreaking as the previous two were. This is where he begins to believe in his own self-importance and in caring less about making good music."
3,Mislead,"Advertisement promises no scratches on CD. Not so, there are many blimishes on item, but it plays."
3,Really,"I like MJ, he was a talented performer, and extremely popular. His music while not challenging, was fun to listen to and had a good beat. But when you break it all down he was a performer and little more. The only real impact he ever made was in the arena of entertainment. Think about all the people who affect life in this country on a very real level. Policy makers, builders, architects who design wonderful things, firemen etc. When they die nobody really cares. Jackson has been dead for a couple months now right? Why is he still in the paper? What about Ted Kennedy? He was a senator for decades and nobody gives a damn. what the hell is wrong with this picture?"
3,Cheesy Goodness!,"Michael Jackson has truely always been a joke, when I've been around. Truthfully he's never been popular since was a toddler and now im in college. So im not a huge mega fan like some people.(actually care more for Jermaine and janet they produce really good soul music).As for Bad, it's got great pop beats, everybody heard the songs a million times, and he's got a great message. Dirty Diana definately an intersting song. As for, the way you make me feel. I think he was truely at his peak of normalness, while making this album. How could you not like this music, it's really good."
3,"This album is pretty ""Bad"" for MJ","I can listen to this and only think that MJ wanted to have Thrillermania all over again.He didn't seem to move anywhere with his craft from Thriller and never really evolved as an artist.Only caught up in the fame and fortune game, and the excitement of yelling and screaming fans.As this was the year Janet was becoming big and her Control album was bigger than this album. Madonna also released her mega hit album True Blue this year.MJ was fearing them taking his throne so he got weirder and weirder.[...]"
1,Sorry has everyone lost their mind?,This record is crap. It was a major let down sales wise after Thriller and only sold as many copies as it did because it was a follow up to one of the biggest albums in Pop music history. Jackson peaked with Thriller and everything after it was a pale comparison. Plus you could not give Micheal Jackson CD's away before he died. There was a reason he was so broke! I am not going to go into his personal life. You don't need to. Based on music alone this record is what it advertised! That this record is Bad. Not bad cool. Just plain old bad!
3,Bad 25th Anniversary Edition,"The CD package was O.K. - it did not have some of my favorites (i.e., PYT and Human Nature).I did like hearing him sing in Spanish and French, which was a first for me."
5,it is a gift,"it arrived on time and was packaged well, hoping that is will be received well....and I would love to have my own copy"
5,One of his best!!,"I have been a fan of Michael Jackson for many, many years and this is one his best albums ever!!!! Awesome!!"
5,TOP STUFF!,"Next to Thriller this IS Michael Jackson's BEST album, and is one that all and everyone should own, hands down!"
3,Collection of Catchy Songs by Michael as a Superstar Entertainer,"Michael Jackson's third solo album, Bad, is more electrified comparing to the previous albums--tracks produced by Quincy Jones are more synthesized and drum programming is substantially used. As a result, the sound become less intriguing but the simplified tracks underscore catchy melodies of songs written by Michael, including four out of the five consecutive number ones on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. While showing off his talent as a singer/songwriter with the album, he is more focusing on establishing as a superstar entertainer with multiple talents, including dance performance that now draws more attention from his fans."
3,Good But Not On The Level Of Thriller,"This release has many ""good"" songs particularly Smooth Criminal, Bad, Liberian Girl, and The Way You Make Me Feel. However the overall flow of the CD just does not compare to the immortal Thriller. The same balance of textures from loud to soft to funky just does not exist here. Liberian Girl breaks the mold a little but the other tracks are semi-generic. Decent, yes but certainly not a classic except maybe for hard core fans."
3,another one hit out of the ballpark by the king of everything musical,anothe awesome dvd by the kingget italot of material /photos of michael in this dvdbad is bad/goodi cannot get enough of his dancing/singing
5,great Album,"great album. We all are buyning MJ's collection again. He will go down in history. So talented and so misunderstood. MJ was a true Indigo (google it) his talents were out of this ""world"" we all know that. Great collections of songs, we know most of these songs.!!!"
4,Memories And Sweet New Gems,"This album brings back wonderful memories of the late 1980's when music was real and fun and MJ was unstoppable. My favs are ""I Just Cant Stop Loving You"", Another Part Of Me"" and ""Liberian Girl"". The outtakes are fantastic, especially ""Song Groove"", ""Free"" and ""StreetWalker"". I dont know how these songs did not make the original album, they would have been massive hits i believe.The Joy of Magic"
5,Marko Patrick St- Mac Naomh,"Best album ever, Best Musician ever, I love Michael Jackson, Huge fan, Was a gift for my birthday, Don't and never will regret buying it, I wouldn't feel complete without doing so, Love you michael <3Sign your #1 fan,Marko."
5,Great Bonus Tracks,"I am a huge MJ fan, so I already actually owned the ""Bad"" album (including other special editions of it), but this special edition had way more bonus music tracks that the other ones have in the past, so I spent the money and got it anyhow. I am so glad I did because the bonus stuff on this is awesome, and I love how the booklet with it has a bit of info on each of the bonus tracks."
5,bad is good,"what pushed me into buying bad? childhood memories of the black mickael, the thought of blasting BAD in my car, and sound quality! they did a great job remastering this album. i never thought i'd ever buy a mj album but i did and i don't regret it. btw... you will get hilarious reactions whist playing this album for friends and co-workers. heck, this is an album everyone can appreciate."
5,"Bad, 25th Anniversary Edition, Deluxe Edition","I'm old enough to remember Michael Jackson just becoming Michael Jackson. My wife and I followed his career to the unfortunate end. This album, as well as Thriller, is an absolute must."
5,THE BADDEST,This is by far my favorite michael Jackson CD. EVERY Song is great! I can listen to this on repeat all day and never get sick of it. DEF. a must have for all MJ fans
4,Who's bad?,"Michael Jackson's Bad is my second favorite album (the first being Thriller) and this album doesn't disappoint especially with tracks like ""Bad"", ""Dirty Diana"", ""Man in the Mirror"" and ""Smooth Criminal""."
5,One of the MJ's great album now with bonus tracks,"this is a special edition of ""Bad"" featuring 11 original songs from the album and 3 bonus tracks.Songs are:1. bad2. the way you make me feel3. speed demon4. liberian girl5. just good friends6. another part of me7. man in the mirror8. i just can't stop loving you9. dirty diana10. smooth criminal11. leave me alonebonus tracks are:1. streetwalker2. todo mi amor eres tu( i just can't stop loving you)3. fly awayof the bonus tracks ""streetwalker"" is very catchy and pleasurable to listenoverall i would rate the album as ""5 STAR"""
4,Bad 25 Deluxe Box Set....Could Be Better!,"This 4 disc Deluxe Edition of 'Bad 25' is very nice, but could be MUCH BETTER. In addition to what's already included (The 2 AWESOME booklets, 3 CDs, Live DVD, poster, sticker), Sony/Legacy should've added a CD featuring ALL of the RARE 12"" Extended Mixes of Bad's singles (IMO, the Afrojack, Pittbull, and Nero mixes are a waste of space...LOL!). The Bonus Material CD is great, but Sony failed to include the demo 'Cheater', which was originally recorded during the 'Bad' sessions, and it appeared on MJ's 'Ultimate Collection' box set back in 2004. While I'm pleased with this box set, I decided to make it EXTRA SPECIAL by including BOTH my 'Moonwalker' & 'Short Films' DVDs, and they fit perfectly. In closing, I'd recommend this 'Bad 25' box set to any Michael Jackson Collector, and let's hope that Sony/Legacy releases BOTH 'Off The Wall 35' and 'Dangerous 25' in the near future!!!"
1,most unusual reviewer and listener,"I borrowed the cd From a friend few years ago to try it.most of the tracks were O.K except Track 9 ""Dirty Diana"":that song sounded awfull and sadistic to me considering the way he sings and screems there along with Steve Stevens Guitar solo.and to make things worse there are some strings played in the song.I'd listened to it few times for a second chance but NO.Im not listening to his songs anymore since they remind me of the exsistance of ""dirty diana"", and im not his fan anymore.I dont recommend this album or his other stuff for those musicologists who keeplimited records collections worth listening to, and for those who understand complex mental psycology."
1,let the dead rest,"Although this was once a great work, it does not survive well. Buy it if you have never had it. Otherwise, its just nostalgia.Sorry, Michael."
3,M.J.BAD CD,"I LIKE THE M.J.BAD CD,THE MUSIC IS GREAT UNTIL IT GET'S 2 THE END @ THEN THEY START 2 TALK ABOUT M.J.@ WHAT HE HAS DON WITH ALL OF HIS MUSIC@ WHAT HE HAS DON 4 OTHER PEOPLE WITH HIS MUSIC,AS 4 ME I LIKE ALL OF M.J. MUSIC,I'VE WATCH HIM GROW UP IN ALL OF THESE YEARS @ NOW NOW HE'S GONE AWAY FROM US ALL, BUT HIS MUSIC WILL LIVE ON 4 EVER MORE,WE LOVE YOU M.J.@ WE MISS YOU."
5,BAD25,"This item really did meet my expectations, I love the new songs! Omgosh this should be the record of the year, it's REAL music! And I never have a problem from Amazon, I strongly suggest those who have never bought from here to try it, they will not disappoint. But BAD25 is a wonderful gift for any MJ fan out there, it really captures some of Michael's most personal thoughts. Thumbs up Amazon."
5,favorite from Michael,"love this - has a great balance of ballad, dance, and rock songs sure to please almost every listener."
5,Perfect.,It's MIchael Jackson's new release. I was waiting for the moment to have it on my hands. It's great! Thank you.
5,Maravilhoso,"Fiquei super satisfeita com essa compra, Michael Jackson é o melhor, nem preciso falar mais nada. Amei, valeu cada centavo gasto."
5,he made thriller....then bad,this is by far my fave album of his. i grew up with this album from the age of 5 to ten and i still love it. my mom always said i could not go to sleep without hearing this album lol. yes thriller was very good and had alot of hits but looking back i think this album made him an artist than the past works.the song man in the mirror shows that. im just glad i have his music today to look back on and listen to.
4,One of his best albums ever,"Regardless of how the irresponsible media portrays MJ, if you are a fan of his music either past or present, I would have to strongly recommend this album to you. In my opinion this album captures a moment in his music making days that was very pure, and very inspired. This album has not just one hit single a a lot of fillers, but many smash hits (Bad, Another Part Of Me, Dirty Diana & Smooth Criminal)- and the rest of the songs you will either love or like depending on your taste for slow or ballad type music."
5,This album is BAD!,Bad in the best of ways! This limited edition contains never before heard demos and comentaries by Quincy Jones.
5,Michael Jackson's Trilogy,"I am not a die-hard Michael ""King of Pop"" fan. However, when reviewing his short lived career. ""Off the Wall"", ""Thriller"", and ""Bad"" are a magnificant acheivment for any artist and the producer(Quincy Jones)to realize in the turbulent 80's music environment that produced much less of importance in this time period. Of course, I love U2, R.E.M., etc. but to ignore this music and cast it off because of personal differences to where Michael ended up is criminal. Love the music!"
4,BAD is good!,"It's a good album, it has some good songs. I like ""Smooth Criminal"" the best. Great sound quality. Get it."
5,Great!,"I sent this item as a gift and the recipient was very pleased! She said everything in the package is amazing, she's enjoying the CDs and DVD very much."
4,Bad is kinda bad...,"For those of you who gave this album 3 to 5 stars, I think that's reasonable. No offense, but my favorite album is THRILLER. I think the only good songs on that album are BAD, THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL, SMOOTH CRIMINAL, LEAVE ME ALONE, and SPEED DEMON. About 1/2 the album. Bad was good, but not good enough..."
5,Bad25,Awesome box set! Michael's performance was like no other. Bad25 is a treasure and I enjoyed the entire set!! The King of Pop is an understatement!!
5,Bad is my favorite song of his :),I got these CDs the day he died. I rushed on the internet minutes after the live news report. I'm glad I did :)
5,leadbelly is the best,"buy this. don't hesitate. it's necessary for you to own it and know it. otherwise you just don't know what you're missing. buy the robert johnson and hank williams complete recordings as well. then you're off to a good start. country blues, to me, is the direct predecessor to rock music, and it's some of the purest, most enjoyable music out there."
3,Broken case,The item/CD played well eventhough the case was damaged beyond use. The outer packaging was intact so it appears that the case was damaged before shipping. I had to purchase a new case so that the CD did not get scratched. This was an inconvenience.
2,Painfully murky audio.,"An evaluation of reviews compelled me to choose this cd over Absolutely The Best (my introduction to Leadbetter, the audio quality ok), though, I should have put more of a premium on sound. I'll get ATB now, even if Last Sessions has the clearest audio experience, but whose version of In New Orleans had traded its original bounce for the dirge qualities of the modern version.ps- if you want a galloping, if wholly unlike the original, interp of the modern version, listen to Tracy Chapman's go in the Elektra 40th anniversary Rubaiyat collection."
3,"Nice Dictionary, but poor in financial terms","The Glossary has a lot of tecnical terms, but it is a little bit poor in financial terms. It is good to someone who's learning english as foreign language or doing some business course. Is does not have especific terms about some subject like financial and accounts."
5,GREAT ADDITION TO YOUR MADONNA COLLECTION,This CD has col remixes of 2 of her best 80's songs plus an instramental version of Dress You Up.
5,Dress You Up,"This cd has been very overlooked, but it is wonderful. All the tracks are great.1. The 12"" Formal Mix: Despite this version is nothing more, than an extended remix, it is still very good!! It is a little better than most 80's mixes.2. The Casual Instrumental mix: This is this instrumental of the Album Version.3. Sho-Bee-Doo: I really like this song, and it is a nice B-Side. You have to listen to more than the first few seconds to really like the song, but once it gets started it's great.This cd also was the first single, in which, Madonna was titling the remix something associated with the song (i.e. The 12"" FORMAL mix or CASUAL Instrumental mix.)"
4,3 meters in 1 case,"I have not recieved This meter (Astatic 600 --5000 watt swr/power meter)--so I can't say much at all,jus send it to me"
2,So-so,"This book was all right, but I really wasn't blown away by it or anything. The plot was a wee bit flimsy, even for porn (which is going some). The writing style was good, though the content was mediocre. If I might make a suggestion, I liked Derek Adams' ""The Mark of the Wolf"" much better, both for plot and for erotic content."
1,Terrible customer service.. Awful,If you read the add you (at least I was) are led to believe that you were getting more than one bracelet. They charged me $9 for shipping a small two ounce yellow padded envelope with only one inside which was double the price of the bracelet(s)! I tried contacting the company several times and could only leave messages of which no one returned my calls. I went back later and resurched the add and they had changed the price. Oblivious to me they had made a mistake advertising their product and were not going to honor their add. Shame on them!
4,Excellent resource for parents,I found it quite simplistic. It does have good ideas for playing and it addresses the importance of play in children's development.
3,The size is too small,I didn't realize it was a small box. I used to by the bigger size for the same money. My fault...
1,Smells nice but falsely advertised,Citronella oil is made from citronella grass and not this hybrid geranium which they now call citronella. This plant will not keep away mosquitoes. Before I did research I bought two of these from home depot for under $6.00 each and they do not work at keeping mosquitoes away at all. Check out more info on web by googling citronella plant.
5,Inhouse garden,Citronella Plant arrived well and is now placed in our living room. Even though in the city mosquitoes are not frequent it is very useful to have this plant in display both for decoration and for defense against uninvited visitors.
1,Doesn't work,I just got the plant yesterday sat it on my porch table and waited at first I thought it was working but when I came home and sat on porch they were every where like they like the plant I think even more where out there back to drawing bored
1,mosquio's are not fleeing.,The plant is healty and very attractive. It looks like an expensive fern however the point was to chase away the mosquitos and I can see no difference at all. To me it is false advertising.
3,Good mindless fun,"Nikki & the Corvettes were a minor blip on the cultural radar of the late '70s, a kind of Blondie lite with a touch of the Ramones. Their songs are simple, fun, catchy, sexy, and completely forgettable. Lead singer Nikki Corvette has an accessible, flirty charm that manages to be both naughtily suggestive and innocently wholesome. This well-packaged reissue CD is nice to have mostly so you can throw a few songs on a compilation mix for your friends, but it doesn't hold up to too many repeated listenings, as the Corvettes' range is simply too limited. Basically, after two or three tracks, all the songs begin to sound the same. Still, a fun rarity for anyone who's into the New York punk/pop scene."
2,hello larry ...,"... let's just say: there was better music being made in detroit in the '70s. a little more entertaining, though, when you could see 'em shake it."
4,Good,"The book was a little used up, but it's still in good quality. The seller gives a decent description for the product."
2,poor,The study guide was in bad conditions the first pages were wet and disappointing with the book but I need it.
2,Not Very Helpful Study Guide,"This Study Guide has many errors, and it's not very helpful. You would be better off just reading the book. Most of the questions in this study guide are the questions from the end of the chapters in the book. This study guide will not help you understand the concepts better, it will only confuse you more. I do not recommend anyone to buy this product. You will be just wasting your time and money."
5,Very Useful Study Guide for First Year Biology,Love the study guide. Really helps in study groups to have something right there to review the material. I definitely recommend getting this study guide to help with Biology.
4,Totally Cool,This lab book really helped me to understand genetics and helped me to study for an exam. I even let other student use the book in group study.This book was a excellent source of information.
2,Like it,"It is helpful, even if you're using the 9th edition. No, it's not the same as the 9th edition, but it also cost MUCH less, and it is, after all, a help, a study guide. Probably 80% of the time helpful."
1,Not great,"This may be the government's idea of a good guide, but Prentice Hall puts out much better stuff. The International Society for Technology in Education (or whatever the acronym stands for) is just another one of those professional associations that is really just talking to its own members. Don't look for innovative solutions here."
1,Simplistic Drivel,"This is a terrible book. In fact, most of the books by this publisher -- ISTE -- are obvious vanity press offerings. If you are interested in technology in education, there are many titles produced by other publishers that are written, edited and produced professionally."
2,CAN OPENER WITH AN ATTITUDE,"It took two adults with college and medical degrees several times to figure out the proper positioning of the can-cutter blade. The safety edge resealable top is a nice feature but the edge of the can is sharp and anything but safe. Basicaly a good product, especially because it isn't electric dependent but the product and manual need reworkPolly OasLas Vegas, NV"
2,Keep looking.,"We are new to karaoke and are gradually learning which companies supply the most authentic and enjoyable music to sing to. This KARAOKE brand has been disappointing to us in that the music and the vocals sound absolutely nothing like the versions we are used to hearing on the radio or from our own personal collections. ""Ridiculous"" is literally the first word that came to mind to describe much of the music when we first heard it. We won't be using it, and we are done buying this brand altogether.As far as Christmas music goes, we decided that it would be more fun to use our own Christmas CD's in the karaoke machine, even though they don't have lyrics on screen, than to use this CD. There are other brands that are much better."
4,Very good read,Slow start but once it gets going very hard book to put down. Helps get a good insight to a teen anakin.
1,mine died as well,I loved how quiet this compressor was... note was... until the motor smoked.. karen- did you already throw yours away.. I am in need of a motor... my unit was barely used.. one day I went to do a light amount of air tool work and started to smell burning wires. thankfully the house breaker blew.
1,Don't buy this,I bought the 20 Gal. model. My previous compressor lasted 20 years. This one is destroyed after 1 year and a half.The piston exploded out of the motor. The waranty is only a year and the service center practicaly said it is disposable because it is oilless. I will never buy from this company again.
2,Meh,"Bought this at Walmart maybe 6 years ago and have used it pretty lightly. I initially bought it and the el cheapo CH air tool kit so I could have an air powered impact wrench to help break suspension bolts loose on a Jeep. HA! This compressor says 125 psi max but the most I could ever get it up to was 90. At that psi, its not enough to break loose any stuborn bolts. I'd say it would only break loose something tightened to maybe 50 ft lbs at best. Thought it would be good for breaking loose or tightening lug nuts for wheels. That requires roughly 100 ft lbs torque but this compressor is way under powered for that. It's a noisy and wimpy compressor. Still runs ok with no leaks but with it being so light duty, I just rarely use it."
3,It's good to tinker around with...,"I use this guy with a Midland 1001Z CB Radio with the PA option. I have it mounted underneath my hood and wired into the cab of my vehicle. With the engine on, people can hear that there's a loudspeaker going off, but it can get hard to understand what he/she is saying. With the engine off, there's no problem at all. If you are looking for a serious mobile PA, look somewhere else. But to play around, this will suit you just fine."
4,"7 Mujeres, 1 Homosexual y Carlos- DVD","Super chistosa esta pelicula! Es una de mis peliculas favoritas. La pelicula me llego bien rapido y es de muy buena calidad.7 Mujeres, Un Homosexual y Carlos"
2,ok movie,it has its funny moments.. overall not to so good.... ninel conde looks uuuggglyyy!! if you want to see ninel conde before she looked gorgeous like now jaja
3,Poor Carlos,"Poor Carlos, honestly, he has it tough. He just got his girlfriend pregnant, marries her and is about to be a father. He is also starting a new job, and of course, his father in law hates him. Oh, did I forget to mention that a woman in his office (Ninel Conde) is literally throwing herself at him.The movie is good, not earth shattering, but entertaining enough. Carlos, who keeps hearing from friends and co-workers that everyman gets 7 women and a homosexual (just in case), has to deal with deciding whether he is happy, morals and whether to remain faithful. His wife is just a spoiled brat! She has to deal with the fact that she cannot live in the same style as she lived with her parents. Ninel Conde is good as the co-worker just throwing herself at Carlos. The movie attempts to have a deep message but it somehow feels very superficial."
4,Enjoyable and well written collection,"I've only read Hayek's ""road to serfdom"" so my experience with his writings is limited. Hayek has a very readible style and language and he does have a knack for explaining difficult concepts in laymen language. This book is a collection of numerous essays and does appear disjointed at times. Collectively, there are many gems of wisdom in this book and well worth your time to read."
2,Not all that glitters...,"Yes, the book is heralded by many. Yes, it is still being used in the Linguistics and English departments of many prominent universities today. However, does that necessarily mean it's all that great???It is highly informative and fairly accurate. However, the book is tainted with linguacentric opinions laced here and there that do not help to educate and enlighten students to the inherent equality of all languages and dialects. A pity!I haven't yet found a perfect text, but perhaps Williams' ""Origins of the English Language"" (available from Amazon ISBN 0029344700) is a better choice for both students and teachers. It is also significantly less expensive."

4,Nearly a perfect product,"I was familiar with this book before I bought it as it was a text when I studied English at University many decades ago. Despite the time lapse, the book retains its top ranking in the area in which I am interested. The copy that I purchased was at a very good price; it was delivered long before the promised date, quite an achievement when it has to travel to Australia. The book was in fine order except - and this is a significant disappointment - a few poems that are printed as examples of Middle English dialects, are heavily underlined in places with a dark blue pen. Overall, however, I am very pleased with my purchase."
4,"Well-worded and succinct, but boring as all get-out.","As someone has already said, this book is not user-friendly. The layout is kind of annoying...it sort of reads like a novel (thank god there are headers, though, because otherwise, I would have just given up before I began).A picture or two would be nice; images bring history to life. Pictures aren't just for kids, you know. :)"
2,Great Voice. Average Tunes.,"I saw her on ""Live from Abbey Road"" singing ""Destruction"". I bought the CD on that song alone. During the interview she mentioned she is writing her own material. She needs to improve or hire a better ""doctor' to fix the songs. No other tune is as good as ""Destruction"".I read that her latest CD is ""country-er"". I generally don't listen to country music, much less buy a CD of that genre. So she's going to have to REALLY improve for me to buy her next CD."
4,LeAnn Rimes surely does give us Whatever We Wanna.,"Not my favorite pop cd by her, but a good album. The songs are good along with the vocals. A very wonderful treat."
5,Mamet is a truely beautiful writer,How can you not be appealed when you read a literate children's book from a man who's works are very testosterone-laden and profanity filled? But his gift fills the pages with a story of a pig who overcomes adversity and discrimination to become a lawyer. I buy this gift for friends who are in law school to put smiles on their faces.
5,Solid Book,"This is one of the better books I have read about managing a LAN. It goes into SNMP, RMON (II) and setup of a switched LAN. I would recommend this book to both new administrators and veterens"
5,The REAL thing..,From a man's point of view....Don't take chances...this IS the REAL product and not a knock off......If your wife or significant other is hooked to this particular perfume (and they will let you know) then it's no harder to find then just coming here!Bvlgari Au The'blanc Perfume by Bvlgari for Women. Eau De Cologne Spray 1.3 oz ...(and they gift wrap)~cek
3,Good workout but boring,"This workout had some really good moves, is very challenging, and is constant movement. But it is so BORING. The music is horrible and his personality is boring. Time moved so slow. I can't bring myself to do this workout."
2,ehhh,"It was a fairly good workout but Jillian Michael's workout DVDs are a better use of my time. Also, I don't trust my fitness time with any training guru who has a completely edited and almost cartoon-like picture of themselves on the cover of their DVD."
1,FBW much like Gooch in person: Shallow and Self-absorbed,"I read FBW as a lark--after having met Brad Gooch at a bar and then going on a dinner date with him while visiting NYC last fall. At dinner, we talked about his upcoming book, its premise, his recent bookcover ""photo shoot"", etc. Never once did Gooch ask me a question about myself. Now I read his book and understand why. It is as pleasant, shallow, narcissistic and self-absorbed as I found him to be. Just in case he reads this (which I have little doubt he will), he WAS attractive, but, as anyone who read the book can attest, he can tell you that."
1,Is this a dating ad or a BOOK?,"I read this book with an open-mind...yet my mind was forced to wander by about the second chapter where he endlessly talks about all of his ""friends"" in Upper Manhattan.I think Gooch wrote this book to make himself feel better about himself! I didn't really leave with anything substantial to take away other than the fact that Gooch likes to eat at fine restaurants in New York, and likes lit candles near his bed. Is this a book or a dating ad?!!I think the endless self-absorption in this book would also be a turn-off for future boyfriends (of the people who read this book).Maybe the problem isn't necessarily one not knowing what our ""inner boyfriend"" wants, but concentrating too much on that entity."
1,Non-book,"Readers interested in a self-help book for gay men might be better off looking at ""How to Survive Your Own Gay Life."" I can only repeat what others have said about the book's vacuousness, narcissism, and lack of depth. The author and his boyfriend within deserve each other."
1,A Waste of Time and Somewhat Disturbing,"I am Sorry to say that I was extremely disappointed in this book. I thought perhaps (in part, based on some of the opinions here) that this might be a book that is down to earth, practical and light-hearted. Wrong!!! This is a shameless exercise in ego and self-promotion.Before you buy this book, I advise that you skim through it and check out the number of times the author uses the pronoun ""I"" . Then check to see what his values are, what he thinks is important in life. Whew! What's truly unbelievable is that the author is in his 40s and still is concerned about going to the movies alone. Hmmm...."
4,SELF-HELP WITH A TWIST FOR THE TWISTED.,"GOOCH SEEMS TO HAVE DEALT HEAD ON WITH ISSUES OTHER GURUS HAVE TURNED AWAY FROM. HIS USE OF EXERCISES BRINGS IT ALL TOGETHER, LEAVING THE READER WITHOUT ANY DOUBTS OF WHY WE BOUGHT THE BOOK, WE NEED HELP."
1,Lock Midge Up!,"A friend gave me this book. I know my friend well enough to now realize that it was a twisted joke (this friend works in publishing and probably got a free copy ... I wouldn't even want a FREE copy). This friend didn't receive a Christmas gift this year, by the way ...Thank goodness Mr. Gooch has his little Midge of a boyfriend within - any advice anyone takes from this book would probably make a potential boyfriend run quickly in the opposite direction.Let me be straight (no pun intended): I don't like self-help books in general. I pay professionals for these services! But for people who do enjoy a little advice now and again, please take mine and DO NOT TOUCH THIS BOOK - you risk turning into a self-absorbed socipath.It should carry warning labels: Toxic Waste, Agony Aunt Drivel, etc.Caveat emptor!"
1,Narcissism 101,"Yes, we do need a certain degree of self-love and self-absorption. It is, after all, considered a normal stage in the development of children. It becomes alarming when an individual of Mr Gooch's age tends to harbor such an exaggerated sense of his own self-importance and uniqueness, is excessively occupied with fantasies about his own attributes and potential for success, and usually depends upon exterior objects for reinforcement of his self-image. His lack of empathy and a propensity for taking advantage of others in the interest of self-aggrandizement is simply disturbing...If you want to learn more about yourself, read the classics of modern psychology, not this sad example of airport literature."
1,"This is a joke, right?","That's what I thought when I saw the cover after unwrapping it (a gift). Then I read it, almost. My conclusion? We're doomed. How does this guy get hired to write anything? It's astoundingly bad. And he supposedly wrote a SERIOUS biography of Frank O'Hara? Hard to imagine after reading this. He must have terrible management."
2,Not Just For Gay Men,"Finding the title provocative, I picked it up at my free public library. I've found it interesting, and not just for gay men. I'm a woman. It's sort of another version of that old standard, ""How To Be Your Own Best Friend."""
3,Interesting Perspective,"Overall, I thought this book brought a fresh insight into self reflection. Although, at times, the author can become self absorbed in his own larger-than-life yet seemingly minute issues, the concepts are interesting. Worth the read."
1,I'm Not Sure If These Results Speak for Themselves...,"I can't relate to this book and the viewpoint of the author. He offers no tangible solutions for me personally in order to improve anything remotely romantically related. Of course, this may be due to my complete lack of understanding in romantic relationships at all, having had no relationships by age, 34. As a gay man I was hoping for a little more substance that would prove productive for me. The only thing this book might be good for where I'm concerned is a drink coaster."
2,Eh,Is very Deepak Chopra-esque. Almost feels like Mr. Gooch might be a closet schizo and this is his way of legitimizing a pathology....
3,The Hansa and its role in the Baltic Sea,The book is old as far as the publishing year is concerned but actually the picture that it depicts of teh Hansa Towns and especially of Lord Novgorod the Great is real within the latest archeoligcal and historiographical frames. The lòanguage is linear but a rigrous one even tho I would have much appreciated if the author had added a bibliography.
1,Waste of time!,"I bought this movie when it first came out thinking it might be good, WOW was I wrong!!! It was the worst movie I had ever seen and I've seen some BAD ones!!"
1,What A Shame,"I picked Lars and the Real Girl up from the library thinking it was going to be a nice romantic comedy. It was my wife's birthday and she enjoys movies starring Ryan Gosling.Boy was I mistaken. This is an independent film about a guy who has some quirks... He decides to get a girl friend and chooses a life-sized doll.When he brings her over to meet his family, the ""comedy"" begins.Pretty soon the whole town is involved because the doctor believes Lars is suffering from some kind of delusion. Something happened to him when he was a boy. And I like how it was written in which you find out the cause.In watching the bonus features, the writer described why she wrote the story. She wanted to see what it would be like if people treated those with mental illnesses with compassion and love instead of ignorance.But other than that, I was disappointed by this film.Too bad too."
1,DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME,"After thoroughly enjoying this super sweet movie, I thought it might do my family and friends some good if I went around for a few weeks with a life-size guy ""doll"" of my own, let's call him Tim.Well, after 6 months in Anoka State Hospital and 2 commitment hearings before a judge, I can now say that it was a terrible idea and something that I would not recommend to anyone ever."
2,Lars,It was definetly funny but awkward. I watched it with my one of my girlfriends and we would look at each other with shock saying is this really happening!
3,So-So,"Movie was pretty dull. Interesting concept but it looked more like it was going to be a comedy than a drama. Also, you spend have the time waiting to see if the mannequin will come to life because you are waiting for something interesting to happen."
1,"Brilliant film, yet another poor blu ray from MGM","If you own the dvd, the blu ray offers a slight improvement in picture quality, however be warned, this so called 1080p transfer uses the exact same 'print' the dvd utilised which means it's a noise riddled, edge enhanced, gate weaving (movement of the entire frame) mess.Unless another company have transferred the film or a major restoration has been undertaken, I'm now avoiding all MGM blu rays.I hope to God they have made the effort and spent money on Some Like It Hot' forthcoming BD..."
5,Don't miss the underlying point,"I agree with all of the positive reviews of this film and while, yes, it was a bit slow, it warmed up and drew me in. The secondary point was one we all should take to heart. The main story was Lars and the ""girl"", but the story of how a church and community loved one of its own through a difficult time was a heartwarming and inspiring tribute to the power of love. Romantic love was part of it, but family, church, and community love were just as important. As you enjoy the quirky comedy, don't miss the underlying message."
5,Great,"I watched this movie years ago, and loved the interesting characters and quirky plot. I recently saw this again by happenstance in Prague, and it was great to see a group of strangers in a bar cracking up over this unique movie."
4,Great story line,This movie just has a great small town humor. Lars has social issues and the community comes together to help him overcome them in a very thoughtful way.
5,One of the best.,"This is one of the most poignant movies I've seen in a long time. Maybe the story is a bit contrived, but the performances are amazing. Ryan Gosling, in particular, captures the expressions, the hesitancies and the nuances of Lars so well. I couldn't take my eyes off of him. Of course, the supporting characters make this movie work and each one is vital to the story, each one literally has a role to play in Lars' life. I laughed, I cried, but mostly, I thought and that to me, makes a good film."
5,Lars Scores with everyone,"A lovely thought provoking movie that brings a plastic woman to life with skill, wit and craft."
5,Amazing,"This is simply the most amazing film I've seen last year. Among all the wonderful things that happen in this movie, I love the idea of how the town joins in to help. Those people who decided to join the pretense in order to help Lars, soon found out that it wasn't hard at all, and little by little, they started to have fun themselves (designing a new haircut for Bianca, getting her new outfits). I frankly don't think this is far-fetched at all. No one is doing anything extraordinary, no super power required to do the pretense, it's all within our ability to be nice. I like to believe we are all capable of doing good things to help our neighbors and friends. In Lars and the real girl, the good-natured people join in to help and it plays off. I love this film. And the wonderful acting, Ryan Gosling is so good is a given. The supporting casts are phenomenal, Emily Mortimer, Paul Schneider, and the adorable Kelli Garner. Great film."
3,"Cute, quirky movie!","Saw this movie with a friend who loves Ryan Gosling and we both thought it was super cute. Actually bought it as a gift and had it shipped to her. She received it promptly even though I changed the delivery address after the order was placed. Overall, good experience and good movie!"
4,It's cute....,The man (Ryan Gosling) always seems to amaze me. He can play just about any character. Nice to see people in an entire town come together.
5,Charming movie,"While some of the themes are not suitable for young children, the movie shows a town's kindnesses toward Lars in ways that help him a great deal. Very positive movie, well acted."
5,interesting movie,"I had to watch this movie as a Communications class assignment. I was worried when I saw the ""real doll,"" but there was nothing to worry about, the movie was tasteful, funny, and well-done. I hadn't heard of it until the class, which is too bad, it is really an interesting movie."
3,"Well Done, But A Flawed Message","This movie did a good job of making me feel sympathetic for Lars, and it also made me sympathize with the friendly townfolk who went to literally ridiculous lengths to coax Lars out of his delusions.At the same time, though, these strengths trouble me a little because they imply that people who prefer to be alone have something ""wrong"" with them and need to be rescued. More often than not, introverts are perfectly healthy and happy living their lives in their own way. They do not need the interaction and noise that most other people cling to for survival, and they certainly do not need some sort of unbidden intervention. Movies like this, however well done, re-affirm the majority's sense of self-righteousness."
3,A quirky yet heartwarming film,"There is something not quite right about Lars. Everyone loves Lars but he keeps his distance. He lives in the garage while his brother and sister-in-law live in the house. No one seems to be able to reach Lars until his girlfriend Bianca arrives. Of course, she arrives in a box and needs some assembling but she is real to Lars. What makes this movie so heartwarming is the love of his family and friends as they decide to play along with Lars and welcome the not so real Bianca into their lives.LARS AND THE REAL GIRL is not for everyone but the sweetness is endearing and it's nice to have a break from the usual movie plot"
3,I'm Impressed,"The premise sounds a bit out there, but it's well written and well acted, making an enjoyable and eminently watchable movie. I enjoy originality in movies, and there isn't enough of it. This is quite original.Why only three stars? About halfway through the movie, or perhaps a little further, the focus drifted a little bit from the humor and into the ""touching drama"" which, quite honestly, didn't work for me so well. Not ""bad,"" but maybe a little boring. Then it finished strong, which is how it started, but well, I'm a jerk."
4,dvd,The DVD came on time and it was in excellent shape. I think there might be a sheet in there with the scene listings that is missing but I am not sure.
2,Hmmm ...,"The concept was good, the acting was certainly well above average, but the film lost momentum and failed to hold my interest about 1/2 way through. I tried to hang in there, but I eventually had to hit the STOP button on my remote control."
4,Strange but very real,"as I watched this I kept wondering ""can this happen"". In today's world we have man problems that face our society. Lars become delusional when he hits bottom and seems to disconnect from the world around him. He embraces this ""doll"" and becomes attached to her as if she were real. But when the real world comes knocking on his door his actions are very interesting. Throughout the movie you start to feel for Lars and pray that he gets through his situation. It's great to see how well the entire town comes together to help Lars overcome his struggle to find happiness. The ending was just perfect."
5,Comedy Charmer,"This is a quirky funny movie that is in a class by itself. Great actors, good script, and wonderful direction make this offbeat movie an unforgettable charmer. Highly recommended."
5,Profound at many levels,"I viewed this movie in the setting of a Clergy conference on Family Systems Theory & triangulation. It was absolutely amazing. I can't quit talking/thinking about it. Acting was strong, convincing, & believable. For those who gave this move a negative review & only a 1 star rating, what a pity; they just didn't get beneath the outside thin layer of the onion & unpack the story. I could watch it again & again, & will probably buy it for home use & small group studies & discussions."
2,Just too bizarre,"The concept of this movie is just too way out there, at least for me. I love a good laugh, but this was RIDICULOUS. Don't waste your time. If you want to laugh, try The Dog Problem. Although quirky, it's a great movie. I like quirky, I really can't stand idiotic. This was as stupid as they come."
2,"Very slow. If quirky for quirky's sake is your thing, then you'll like it","This movie has a couple of ""chuckle"" moments, but as I watched it, I couldn't help but feel sad for the characters in this film. It reminded me a lot of a Christopher Guest film where you're watching unidimensional characters interact with one another in a desperate and feeble attempt to find happiness and acceptance."
5,A great movie in every way!,This has got to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. A totally entertaining journey from start to finish. It made me laugh a lot and cry too and has a feel good factor that's second to none. Ryan Gosling is amazing. You have to see this movie!!!!!
2,The DVD was poor quality and would pause and skip.,"The DVD was poor quality and would pause and skip. Even though it was advertised as being in it's original wrapper,obviously it was still of a lesser quality than what is available in a store.Second rate quality should be advertised as such."
1,Lars and the Real Girl is not a comedy. It is actually depressing.,"This guy was a real basket case whose girlfriend was a real life doll. He took her everywhere, having conversations with her.Lars actually thought she was answering him back.Then the family was dragged into taking care of this doll treating this thing like a real person.I did not like the movie after the first half hour. Unfortunately, my husband thought the movie would get better. It did not.Sorry, for the one star. This movie is depressing in that there are some people that actually think this way.Take it out of the comedy category. This is not a funny movie."
2,Lars and the Real Girl,"""Lars and the Real Girl"" is an interesting, although somewhat weird movie about a young man with a blow-up doll girlfriend, who seems to being using his blow-up doll girlfriend to deal with some kind of psychological problem from his childhood. A useful learning tool for students taking an abnormal psychology class that are learning how to diagnose certain psychological disorders. This movie is definitely meant for an older audience."
2,Quality of Lars and the Real Girl,The price on the DVD was very reasonable and the shipping costs were great. The problem is that the movie was breaking down in several places and i lost the audio and video due to the quality. It was for a school assignment so I ended up renting one at a movie store and found that I missed a good part of the DVD on the one I received. So i guess you could say I got my money's worth. Low price and low quality.
2,I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MANY RAVE REVIEWS. I DION'T THINK THERE WAS ANYTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS MOVIE.,"For me, this movie is a real DISAPPOINTMENT. COMEDY? NO! ROMANCE? NO. MENTAL ILLNESS? MORE THAN ENOUGH OF THAT TO GO AROUND.A man develops a RELATIONSHIP/ROMANCE with a BLOW UP DOLL and every one goes along with it--I MEAN EVERYONE. I guess there is potential for humor or tragedy or SOMETHING, but not the way this is played. This indy misses the mark, BIG TIME. I do not understand the many rave reviews. DIFFERENT STROKES!!"
3,Interesting,"This movie I thought was a comedy is actually something special, it is funny at times but its warm and shows how people can come together and show their love and support for a person in their community."
3,Strange and Quirky Movie,Ryan Gosling certainly show his chops in this movie. He is almost unrecognizable and you forget that you are watching Ryan Gosling. I had no expectations for this movie and I must say it suprised me. It was pretty good. It was quirky as heck and the subject matter was very strange but touching. I wouldn't recommend it to everybody but I enjoyed it.
4,Yearning for more...,"This cd left me yearning for more in a couple of respects. For one, there are only 9 songs on this cd. Second, and most importantly, what is here is a wonderful collection of sings that toe the line between being catchy, accessible pop, and songs that are simply much more ambitious and adventurous. It will take a couple of listens to get used to, but the aching lines of guitar feedback that drive several songs, the outstanding drumming and percussion, and the fleeting glimpses of sun-shiny melodies will prevail and win you over. Similar to bands like Low, Red House Painters, and Acetone. Looking forward to the next record..."
4,Nordic Songs,"Many of the earlier reviewers have called these wonderful melodies ""scandinavian songs"". A correction: Sibelius is a Finnish Composer - and Finland is not Scandinavia. Therefore, I think, it would be more proper to call these songs ""nordic"".I love all of these songs. And I very much admire that an american singer of the calibre of Barbara Bonney has decided to tackle them. She brings to each one of these ""nordic songs"" a sincere and individual approach. However, the nordic languages pose some difficulty to her.For anyone interested in Sibelius songs, there are wonderful recordings by Tom Krause and Jorma Hynninen - both baritones from Finland."
5,Bonney is divine,"I was introduced to Barbara Bonney at a Boston Symphony performance of Barber's ""Knoxville"" and was knocked out. I've heard her several times since and decided to purchase ""Diamonds in the Snow"" on a lark. This amazing collection has since replaced my ""marooned on a desert island"" choice from Dawn Upshaw's ""Songs of the Auvergne"" (although I would beg to please take both). Bonney's smooth, supple voice and lyrical interpretation of Grieg and Sibelius soothes me in the darkest hours."
5,VERY GOOD AND EXCELLENT BOOK,The book is good and the write up is very detail. I really like the book as the recipes are easy to follow even though some of it is very time consuming. This book suit both amateur and professional.
2,give me a break,"I am a professional pastry chef and have bought the other two books put out by Chocolatier, which are useful, however this book while being good in the home is useless in the pro shop. Why? Simply because the measurements are again cups and teaspoons. A shop deals in weight. I do not have the time nor inclination to scale a cup of cocoa. I find it a very egocentric concept to ignore the fact that most of the world is metric."
1,Theosophical madness,"I think this book would be great for theosophists, but I am certainly not one. I found it to be a great insight into the mind of a theosophical ""saint"" but other than that, I found her ideas and conclusions to be fruitless, boring, and just plain absurd."
1,"WARNING: False, Satanic Teaching !","If you want to debunk this book, look at Acts 1:9-11. Jesus was talking to his disciples in that passage and was taken up into heaven. Luke uses the phrase, ""before their very eyes."" They were then told, ""This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven."" Note the wording, ""This SAME Jesus"", and ""will come back in the SAME way."" This book is purposefully deceptive. The religious right may have some political issues to deal with, but scripturally they're correct! This author is deceived and is deceiving others!"
4,PLEASE REISSUE!,"This first posthumous release is excellent. I don't know if Hendrix planned to have these songs together, but a great job was done making it sound like a cohesive offering. One could be fooled into thinking the album was finished prior to his death. I know the songs were put out on 'New Rays Of The Rising Sun' but to me this is tighter. 'Freedom', 'Angel', 'Drifting' are all great. 'Straight Ahead' jams. Basically, it's all good. Get it if you can. You won't be sorry."
3,Just get first rays,"First rays of the new rising sun has all of these songs plus more unreleased, just gat that album"
3,New albums have made this one Irrelevant,Jimi Hendrix / The Cry of Love: This album was the first posthumous release and has subsequently been made irrelevant. It is certainly NOT worth paying more than $10 for.
5,"Jimi Hendrix ""Cry of Love""","I own this album, but I wanted to listen to this in my car and at work on my CD player. This is an over looked gem. Belly Button Window is a social commentary about abortion from the baby's point of view. Angel is just a beautiful piece of music and perhaps a little prophetic. My Friend, Straight Ahead and Drifting are also beautiful - perhaps another side of Hendrix that people aren't accustomed to."
5,Educational and entertaining at the same time!,"This was my first WAR DVD purchase. As an aviation enthusiast and flight simmer, the presentation was really wonderful. I appreciated the aircraft walk-around prior to cockpit preparation. The cockpit procedures and checklist were easy to understand (despite their accents). Another great feature was the inflight meal preparation which was meticulously done by an inflight chef. When the crew encountered a fuel imbalance during cruise, I paused the video and thought of the possible solution. I'm glad that it was right! This DVD is a truly recommended material. A great way to start my WAR collection."
5,easy excersise,This is a affordable and easy way to exercise. You can watch tv or listen to it and still get a work out.Highly recommemd
1,very uncomfortable,I did not like this at all. It was very uncomforable. It would hurt my back when trying to do the exercises in it.
2,So so,"This product is ok, but if you have any kind of health issue talk to your Dr first. My mother got dizzy when she used it."
3,The second Time Around Review,"Although I had problems with the seller, he was courteous and tried to work to my satifaction. I have always liked the ab lounge. It's a good product. I would never purchase a used product because you don't know what you will get."
1,It's not really better.,"Only value I imagine for this is a ""stepping stone"" to real exercise: Use it a little while, realize whatever it can do is limited, & move on to the real exercise you now feel prepared to try. As is the case with most ""as seen on tv"" stuff, ""Ab-Lounge"" is actually the -opposite- of effective exercise: It makes the movement -easier- than with no equipment at all, -too- easy. (Obviously what many people are looking for: To fool themselves.) The essential points of exercising: 1/Train body to meet greater physical demands. 2/A more enduring, stronger body's a better-looking body. Ab-Lounger: Little to no challenge: Little to no Progress: Little to no improvement in appearance. (Incidentally: 90%+ of improved waistline appearance is due to diet.)"
1,Defective Unable to use,Parts would not fit together. Holes for bolts also would not line up. Very defective. Looked like a manufacturing problem.
4,ChrisN,Nice lower back stretch. The holes in the arms had to be redrilled because they did not line up during assembly. It feels a bit wobbly so I hope it holds up. We are two average sized adults so there won't be any excessive weight on the material.
2,An lounger not that great,If Ur first starting off on a weight lost program the ab lounger may not be for u. Also it doesn't really work off Ur love handles. Unless Ur already fit . This equipment appears to be more for people who r further along in weight management and looking to sustain current weight and strength
3,The incorrectly assembled portion created problems.,"The Ab Lounge is a good product we've used in our summer home. However, we ordered a second one this past December that proved to be frustrating from the moment we began to assemble it. A good portion was previously assembled. That would have been great if done correctly but it was so wrong as to seem intentional. We returned the product rather than struggle with assembly any longer."
4,"Good Product, but takes up too much room",I have owned this product for about 18 months and use it at least 3 times a week. It provides very good results overall - I especially like the fact that you can stretch back (bowing your body)and then curl up to complete the crunch. Shifting positions allows you to target different abdominal muscles. Only real gripe (and hence the 4 stars)is the unit takes up a lot of room and can not be folded for storage.
1,Didn't See Any Real Results,"I'm a slender girl, but my abs definitely need some firming up. So, I bought the Ab Lounge. I used it every morning for about twenty minutes a day (the recommended amount) for about six weeks. I didn't notice any significant difference in my stomach--it was easier to ""tighten,"" but no visible improvements. Then, a few months after, I noticed the tv advertisements for it had a new disclaimer: results not typical. I completely agreed with this.I'm sure there are better products out there."
5,AB lounge sport,To begin with my wife loves it she has not stop using it since she got it. It got here on the day told to use with no problem
3,Um...Why are my handles going outwards?,"Just opened it and assembled it properly. My handles are going either inward or if I flip them, outward. They are not going downwards like everyone else's. Wtf?I'm just gonna rate it in the middle cuz I only used it once so far and I'm outdone by the handle grips._____Update:I've used it for a while now (approx 6 months) and yep, My handles do not match the picture. Other than that it's pretty durable. And I think I need a lil oil or to tighten some screws cuz it squeaks. Lost around 15 lbs. already just going at it for 30 mins every other week & a lil less caloric intake."
1,Beware of this product,Badly hurt my back on this exerciser. Ended up throwing it in the trash where it belongs.
3,I never ended up using it for very long,It seems as though it may have worked if I actually used it but I don't. I got it to slim my tummy and not hurt my back. It doesn't hurt my back but is a bit boring.
4,Dillon's review,"I have only been using the Ab Lounge for a few weeks but I do belive it will help to reduce flab and improvemuscle tone in my abs and help to strengten my back muscles. At the age on 76 I do not expect to add a ""six pack"" look but hope to lose the ""overhang of the belt"". I have loss 15 pounds and reduced 2 inches off my my waist area with the help of the Ab Lounge and a more healthy diet. I would recoment the Ab Lounge to anyone but, don't expect miracles and work at getting healthier."
3,need more room,"Even though my husband did some alterations to the folding mechanism, making it easier to fold up when I'm through, I am still discouraged to use it because of the inconvenience of it. I feel that if you want to be serious about using this item, you will need to have a room where you can leave the Ab Lounge set up all the time, or you just won't want to mess with it."
2,Not what I expected,"These sheets were pretty rough, I'm not sure I'm ever going to use them they feel that uncomfortable. It's like that paper that doctors put down on the table before you sit. Just not fun to sleep on."
4,XL Twin Sheets,I just bought an XL twin mattress and needed sheets for it. These fit the bill and seem to be good value for the money.
3,A stealth submarine is hijacked,"A stealth submarine like the one inThe Hunt for Red Octoberis hijacked by the XO and a crew while answering a distress call.The ship doctor and an electronics/ communications mate try toput a wrench into the A bomb missile launching plan. One billion dollarsfor Washington, D.C. is the ransom demand. A head to head with another attack sub takes place due to the damage dome by the two tothe electrical systems.Pretty good as submarine movies go with good solid acting."
5,More Please...,"I Truly Enjoyed This Set!! I Grew Up Watching And Loving This Show, Tony, Telma & Joyce Were All Funny & Really Entertaining. The Guest Stars Were Great & George Carlin Was A Treat!!!! My Favorite Moment Was With Phyllis Diller....A Classic On TV!!!!! I Hope R2 Entertainment Will Release More Volumes."
5,Tony Orlando & Dawn - The Ultimate Collection,"The DVD's are great. If you liked Tony Orlando's TV show, you will really like these DVD's."
1,Cheap looking...shockingly cheap looking.,"This dulcimer came with one very positive customer review about its wonderful sound quality. Unfortunately, I couldn't get past the poor esthetics to even GET to the sound quality. The cut-out ""leaves"" of the instrument are attached with what appears to be a BLUE ball-point pen. I couldn't believe it! I returned the product immediately and bought another brand of instrument that arrived BEAUTIFUL and with a case for $20.00 more."
1,WARNING : OPERA WITH NO SUBTITLES !,"This is an opera in Checkoslovakian without any sub-titles, which is unheard of in the world of opera DVD's. Typically, every DVD comes with a main screen where you do choose the sound, the sub-titles, the scenes, etc. This Blu-Ray has none of this and again no sub-titles in any language. Normally an opera DVD will give you a choice of sub-titles in five or six languages. This is a pity, because just watching the beginning, I could tell that the mise-en-scene was quite interesting. I am returning my purchase."
2,Handi-Mate JR attachment,"We have purchased 2 different Kenmore Progressive vacuum cleaners, one for personal use and one for our church. WARNING!!! The Handi-Mate JR is well made, however, be warned that the belt on it is very thin and flimsy and will not last long. There is NO replacement belt for this attachment. Sears considers this a throw-away item and wants you to buy a whole new Handi-Mate JR attachment at anywhere from $24-$50, depending on the model number of the sweeper (for exact same attachment, different prices). We are happy with the sweeper, however, we are VERY UNHAPPY with this attachment."
2,Not worth it,"A rather ugly story, with mostly very ugly people. The author tries to be funny by trashing all classes, professions and nationalities, and by resorting to simple excess, and it quickly becomes tiresome. He's read too much Bertie Wooster, without the skill to work it."
2,Boring book with strong ending,"This book was one of the hardest to finish I've ever come across. It was just boring. There were some very witty turns of phrases sprinkled throughout, but they diamonds buried under too many uninteresting ones. Also, the wit often seemed out of place with rape a central theme of the book. However, at the end the author seems to quit trying to be witty and the writing and pace of the book improves tremendously. The ending saved this from being a one-star review."
3,"Oh, how I wanted to like this book.","Because of Leo Carey's wry, admiring, melancholy essay in THE NEW YORKER, I grabbed this novel and its two prequels when I found them at a local used bookstore, and oh, how I wanted to like them more than I ended up doing. But they're just not as good as the hype. They drift all over the place [to be fair, Carey admitted that devotees of mysteries would find these books too undisciplined], and the narrator's aggressively amoral personality -- imagine P. G. Wodehouse's Bertie Wooster crossed with Jonathan Gash's Lovejoy -- can wear on one after a while. The plots are made of Swiss cheese, at best, and these books are also sadly dated in their views of women. Maybe it's because I read the Lovejoy books before these -- if I had come to them without knowing about Lovejoy, I would have enjoyed them more."
2,"Like a pretentious imported cheese that's ""gone off a bit""...?","Like reviewer Bernstein below, I really wanted to fall in love with this book and others by Bonfiglioli.I heard his prose compared favorably with Wodehouse and imagined twisted plots, rapier wit, deft turns of phrase...in short, I got a bit goosebumpy. When I got my hands on this book, I jumped into the ""comfy armchair"" with a cup of coffee and orders for everyone around me to be quiet, and looked forward to a few hours of blissful bookish abandon.After the first chapter or so, I put those expectations aside, and simply hoped for a good read, but the book was not to my taste. The characters did not engage, the plot did not grip...the writing did not...well, it just didn't.I felt as though I were looking at one of those awful ""3-D"" pictures from the 1990's, and everyone could see the invisible dancing dolphins depicted in the swirling blue-green miasma but me. I just don't ""get"" Charlie Mordecai. Sigh."
3,some unusual designs,"29 sweaters each with a large animal on the front or back. A snake that winds right round the body; a flamingo; a cute tiger and a splendid tree frog. Others are a bit strange- notably the upside-down bat. Pigs, cows, guinea pigs, badgers...they're all here. I'm not sure I'd knit one now(bought this in 1985) but might transfer the designs onto a blanket or other item."
1,Aluminum Shovel fell apart after 1 snow storm,"The 24'ALU Snow Push Shovel we purchased on Nov 4th 2010 and we had to use inJanuary 2011 did not even last through one show storm!The brace that holds the back of the shovel in place separated and bent, the screw that holds the bottom of the shovel to the handle came out and the part of the shovel that is used for shoveling the snow is now missing 2 or 3 inches of length.Basically, the shovel fell apart after 1 snowstorm!"
2,Snow shovel,"The ""wear"" strip has worn out in one season's use. I would not recommend this shovel. It is not worth the price."
4,"Not a country fan, but love this album","My ex-boyfriend gave me this CD, mainly because he found it funny and kind of annoying, and he was really surprised when I said I loved it. I used to have to edit masses of HTML, and this was a great album to listen to while I did that. I love driving with it as well. It's funny, you can sing along to it, and the music is good. The only other country I really like are Van Lear Rose by Loretta Lynn and the O Brother Soundtrack, so I'm by no means a country music expert. But buy it! You won't be disappointed."
3,NOT THAT BAD,3 STARS because it sounds fine but it sounds not as good as the other album called STRAUSS GREATEST HITS by RCA.
4,excellent could not find any thing like it in irelsnd,I found the stencils very easy to use and clear I could not find any thing like them in Ireland
4,A Good Repair Guide,This Book is filled with valuable information if you own a Jeep. I own a 1999 Wrangler Sahara and when I compared some of the information given about my vehicle it did not match up. I have been waiting for the 2000- 2001 version to see if there has been any improvement on the information about the 1999 Wranglers but the book has yet to come about.
4,Long Term Care Planning,"Long Term Care can be difficult to plan by yourself. My name is Denise Kent, an attorney in Elder Law, Estate & Trust planning, and Family Law. This book is useful to cover the basics but there is still more families should know, especially with the constant changes to Medicare and Medicaid, to plan appropriately. Please find us online if you are interested in a consultation."
5,House Histories: A Guide to Tracing the Genealogy of Your Home,"Excellent book as a resource for old homes. So much great information. The only problem is that it covers so much information, it's hard to get specific information for a specific type home."
4,Animated title sequence/American version of Release,"The animated title sequence was added to the film by the American distributors/producers (Martin Ransohoff). That is probably why it is not on the dvd edition, being it is the directors' cut. There were various other items that the American producers did to the film, including speeding up some sequences to look like ""Keystone Cops"" segments and dubbing the original voices with different dialog lines, because at the time, the studio didn't know what to make of a comic horror film and how to market it."
4,Klichés Exaggerated To Pure Fun,"The Fearless Vampire Killers Or Pardon Me, But Your Teeth Are In My Neck is simply the best vampire film AND the best horror comedy made so far.The fact that it's made in the 1960s does not matter in this case - in contrary. Polanski has taken every fantasy we have about vampires - surroundings, landscape, castle, characters - and exaggerated these stereotypes into a such extent that it becomes pure fun. A parody with an unbeatable humour! And one of the very rare films which succeeds in combining comedy with horror and thereby making both genres better!Highly recommendable!"
3,I enjoyed it,It is a funny and entertaining movie but I think the age has made it les appealing than when it first showed.
5,The Fearlesss Vampire Killers,"Excellent films, funny, dramatic, and exciteing. You go from the edge of your seatin suspence and horror, to the floor laughing."
4,Great spoof.,"This is a great spoof of vampire movies. It's quite funny, albeit slightly boring. I do love this movie though. I'd also like to recommend the musical based on this movie, ""Tanz der Vampire."""
4,my review,This is a good movie for that type of genre. I bought this for a movie fan and she really liked it. I'd seen it before and it is kind of funny! lol
1,Awful,"Laughably awful... though, I suppose a success on some level. Purchased for my father, who got a kick out of it."
1,"not spooky, not funny, not sexy",There's a reason Polanski is not known as a comedy director. I dont know. Maybe this was funny by 60s standards? Laugh-in? This film certainly wasnt scarey. And the cut erotic scenes are G-rated by 2007 standards.
1,The Fearless Vampire Killers,"I read the reviews prior to renting this movie and think overall they are inaccurate. The movie has a few laughable moments; however, overall it is not funny. I wish I had not wasted my money."
3,Sharon Tate Cleans Up!,"I'll confess. I bought this movie because I'm a fan of Sharon Tate. I have been ever since I saw photos of her in Muscular Development magazine back in the mid 60s. I mourned when her life was cut short by vicious killers who showed not an ounce of compassion for her nor her unborn child. So I was looking forward to seeing her in The Fearless Vampire Killers. After watching it, I'll say this. Sharon Tate must like have liked to stay clean. By my count, she took 3 baths in the movie. There are some funny moments in the movie, as there should be. It's a comedy. I've seen better. I've seen worse, too. It's worth watching, but there are better comedies. There are better vampire movies. There is at least one better Sharon Tate movie. (This is only the second movie with her I've seen.) So my summary of this movie is, it's average."
3,One of Polanski's first mainstream films,"Honestly, this movie isn't very good. For the time, it was an attempt at thinking outside the box -- which Polanski is known for. An interesting spin and an interesting plot. The acting definately left a lot to be desired. But the jewel in this crown... seeing Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate together on screen."
1,Stunning . . .,"I'm stunned, STUNNED, at all the 4 and 5 star reviews of this film. Watching it, I found it to be beautiful and atmospheric in its sets and cinematography. It is a shame it wasn't a full on horror film, ala Hammer Films. The two younger women in the film are nice to look at, Sharon Tate especially. However, this film is supposed to be a comedy, and it is painfully unfunny. One mild chuckle at best, and now I am hard pressed to remember what that was for. Looking for some reassurance of my opinion, and finding little here, I read Roger Ebert's original 1968 review for the film at www.rogerebert.com. The review is funnier than the film, and it's not one of Ebert's funnier reviews."
1,Worthless,"No plot, no acting skills displayed (except bad ones), poor music, poor photography, and an overall worthless movie from start to finish.This movie is billed as a comedy but fails in every aspect of movie making. It is not funny. The plot is non existant, and the music and photography are not just bad, they are awful. The viewer cannot tell night from day, and the story line doesn't help one decide if it is night or day. The acting is so bad that it makes a cartoon look good. The sound is also bad and the dialog is almost impossible to follow.One star is too much for this movie. Avoid it at all costs."
4,Classic Vampire Fun,"I first saw this movie when I was about 11 years old. I loved it so much that, 30 years later, I still remembered it. We rented it recently and, to my dismay, it had been colorized. The original black and white version is MUCH better, but the film is still great fun. The bumbling professor and his associate are hilarious, and the innkeeper turned vampire still makes me laugh. If you're looking for depth, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for campy spoof, this is one must-see film."
4,Entertaining mix of vampire horror and humor,"In my opinion, this is on of Polanski's best movies. He and Jack MacGowran work well together as a team. The movie starts off with the pair traveling to a small village that, they quickly find out, is plagued with vampires. They must rescue the inkeeper's daughter from the evil Count and his, shall we say, gay son who has taken a liking to Alfred. Can they outsmart the vampires long enough to escape immortality? Buy it and see. A very entertaining movie throughout with a surprise ending, this movie is a sure bet."
4,a cult classic,"I love this movie. It thrills me from the lavishly odd musical intro to the quirky period picturesque feel to the film. I feel like I am IN Transylvania. The film achieves the look of ""old."" The professor is wonderfully kooky and watching young Roman Polanski is a delight. I did not realize that his wife, Sharon Tate, was so beautiful. I don't know that I have ever seen her in anything else. There is plenty of humor in the film. I wasn't so thrilled with the one vampire being gay, but it was not pervasive to the film and I saw the humor in the situation. If you are looking for a gory, scary vampire film...do not bother...this film is more about the period, the place, the charm of a fun caper gone awry. In our house it is the only vampire movie we drag out every now and again to enjoy. Thanks Roman and Sharon! Well done!!!!"
5,Fearless Vampire Killers,"It is not often that a movie thought of a hilarious and wonderful in one's youth, is as funny 35 or 40 years later. In this case, it certainly holds true, and I was delighted to watch it an laugh my head off. A take-off of every cornball vampire movie you have ever seen. Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate in the happy days before her terrible murder by the Charles Manson Gang."
3,"Wonderful first half, gets boring afterwards","This book reignited my interest in history. Absolutely fantastic first 100 pages; I ended up watching quite a number of lectures in coursera on ~1300 a.d history as a result.Then, it got a big draggy and pretty boring towards the end.Its worth getting though if you're a coffee lover. A lot of interesting facts packaged in a thin book."
3,not exactly what I expected,"I was looking for a book on coffee history related to the types of roasting. This book had some history to it, but wasn't exactly what I was aiming for. The contents of the book are more-less the travel experiences of the writer and the course he took to discover the different origins from which coffee came about."
5,coffee and cheap travel,"This book is a great read. Fake art, fake art smuggling, the adventures of a hippie-type. The history of coffee is the unifying metaphor. Did coffee start off as a kind of tea made from the leaves? And a final drugged out coffee tour of the US.The book is well researched and has a great bibliography. When I finished I gave it to a person from a different culture so he could see the way Americans look at the world."
4,Writing on a Coffee Buzz,"I enjoyed this book by Mr. Allen. It is basically a personal narrative on his travels so it can also be considered a travel essay. As he experiences various regions, he stops and samples various brews. The ""History of the World"" portion of the title comes from amusing anecdotes throughout the book relating to coffee. I enjoyed learning about some of the regions where coffee was outlawed at a time and the reasoning or lack of behind it. I am only giving it four stars because I wanted more as was related to the title and less narrative. Some chapters are amusing, but there are portions of the book I just skipped over, but all in all a nice effort and I would recommend it. This book appeared to have been written very quickly with quick tidbits of humour. I am convinced Mr Allen was intoxicated with double shot's of espresso while writing this text. After I finished, I brewed up some coffee of my own!- David Carlin"
3,Aptly Titled Collection,"db, whom I respect and admire crazily, has released a collection of alternative drum 'n bass tracks. His selection does not represent anything catchy or dancefloor-friendly for that matter, but it does display some new and sometimes interesting directions. If you have taste for the avant-garde or different, then you'll be intrigued by some of what you hear. If your mind is pinned to the two-step/deep bass synth of club jungle, then you'll be sorely disappointed."
1,Worst iron available!,My old iron recently broke so I bought this one thinking that it would be great. It is not. It routinely pours water out of the steam holes essentially drenching the clothes and ironing board. The iron with shut off mid use and the only way to turn it back on is to unplug it for several seconds and replug it in. The steam settings seam to have no effect on the amount of steam (or water) it expels and the you are required to go over wrinkles multiple times to get them out. I also bought a Euro-Pro Shark vaccuum that has had nothing but problems. I cannot recommend this iron nor any products by them. I ended up pitching this iron (after only 3 months) and bought a Black and Decker instead.
1,awful iron,"I am not sure if this is the exact model I bought a little over a year ago, but the model I have looks very similar. What an awful excuse for an iron. Water floods out of all the crevises (where it is not supposed to come out), even when set at dry ironing. I totally quit using steam and just spray my clothes with a water bottle to steam them. I would advise staying AWAY from this iron."
1,Don't buy this iron!,"I wish I had read the other reviews before I bought this iron when my old one died. My old iron was a cheap Sunbeam which lasted for years.This is the worst iron I have ever used. This iron will not get wrinkles out, even with the setting as high as it will go and steam on full blast. When ironing the thinnest of fabrics, this iron still leaves wrinkles. The base will not sit properly on the ironing board, so it's always falling over - really hazardous. I haven't had the major leaking problem that others have experienced, but it wouldn't surprise me if that happens next.What's the point of making an iron that can't iron? It's useless, and now I have to buy a new iron, after only having had this one for a couple months."
1,SHARK IRONS - WATCH OUT!! If only zero stars were available...,"This is the 2nd time in 3 years that I have stupidly purchased a Shark iron. When the first one broke, I didn't complain - just ran out to the store and bought a new one, which incidentally happened to be another Shark. Now this second one is suddenly not working, even though I have cared for it very carefully. I called customer service to see how they could help me... and get this ... they want me to not only pay to ship it back, but also to pay to repair it. OUCH! I have never, ever, ever experienced a combination of such shoddy products and poor customer service in my life. Watch out for Shark irons - they are pure junk."
1,Awful Leaky Iron,"This is an awful iron. It does nothing but drench your clothes in water. This thing is not 25 cents. Turning off the steam makes absolutely no difference, either way your clothes will get soaked. Avoid this iron like the plague."
3,I HATE THIS DISHWASHER,THIS SI THE WORST DISHWASHER EVER. THE IRON IS BETER AT WASHING DISHES IN THIS. I THINK WHOEVER MADE THIS DISHWASHER SHOULD USE IT FOR IRONING INSTEAD. NOT ONLY IS IT ROUGH ON THE SOUL. IT BURNS HOLES THROUGH YOUR CLOTHES IF YOU ONLY LEAVE IT ON FOR 2 MINUTES. THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF SAFETY THING ON THIS. HOLD ON MY COMPUTERS RINGING
2,Nothing more than definitions,"The book contains defnitions of Forex terms which you could get on the web for free. If you are looking for strategy, trends or understanding then look for another book. The most annoying part is a quarter of the book is filler appendix with useless stuff like a list of every currency in the world."
2,broad over view,but abit lacking on knowledge.not enough indepth knowledge and wisdom for me. but none the less useful. more of a quick reference i think.a book more if want a sneek peak at the forex market. easy to read and understand.
2,Boring and Just a Bunch of Information stuffed in There,I found this very hard to follow and it seemed like a lot of of info was just copy and pasted into the book. Who knows. That's just my humble opionion.
2,Disappointing,"This book hovered at such a high level I never really found anything that I could call immediately useable. If you've never been exposed to trading currencies at any level, perhaps you would find this book worthwhile. However, if you have even a nominal amount of experience doing so, this book will really disappoint...Don't buy it hoping to find any trading strategies, nuggets of wisdom or anything else that you could add to your trading bag of tricks, because there aren't any."
1,USELESS,"The authors brief treatment of what are very complex topics will lead readers to falsely believe that they can trade these markets with little training. It appears that the authors basically cut and pasted brief paragraphs about a variet of topics and called it a book. Other reviewers have called it a 'big picture' book, the truth is it is a complete waste of time and money."
2,Hardly worth the money you pay,"I was disappointed that this book contained only a rather broad and vague overview of terms and concepts related to currency trading. I was hoping to get a little more detail about trading techniques or strategies. This book might still be considered a useful reference for the *absolute* novice trader... except for the fact that in my experience, all of the information contained in it (and more) is available for free on the tutorial pages of major online forex brokers. The quality of the writing on the brokers' websites is generally higher than that of this book, as well. In the end, the book is not horrible, but I don't think it's worth even the discounted price that you pay for it on Amazon."
3,A Good Place to Get Started.,"This book gives you a basic idea on how fundamental data effectscurrency prices. It shows you what to look for in a broker, andwhat questions you should ask them. They talk about some of the technical tools they use to trade. This is a good book for a beginner,but it still leaves one with questions on how to put it all together as a system. Enjoy."
3,Good for Getting Started,"The book pretty much satisfies any person who wants to read a book about ""getting started"" in Forex. It starts simply enough to give the reader an idea if he or she wants to get into Forex. That being said, do not expect very detailed explanation on anything above the basics of Forex. Ironically, the author sometimes forgets that he is talking to those getting started as he starts talking forex speak on matters he has yet to explain clearly. While the introduction to Forex is substantial, once you move on to actual trading discussions, it tends to be too general (and as mentioned, refers to terms he has not made the reader familiar with). So take the book as it is, as getting started then its worth the price, but anything beyond the first step, this may be lacking."
3,Great overview of the market.,"I have been trading currencies for about a year and a half now, and this was a great start to get a broad picture of the FX market.This isn't a ""dummies"" step by step but it is a clear overview of trading in the currency market.It could be written with a little more... excitement or novelty. It is a fairly clinical read. It isn't a good comparison but triple w dot babypips dot com is a fun version of the material in this book. They are not associated but the web site is a good primer for this read (or vise versa).The basics are all covered and that makes it worth the price."
5,Like it,"I got this tool for a wonderful price on sale for $0.49 a piece. So, I bought 10 for gifts. it's a lightweight handy tool. Ive had it on my keychain for less than a week and have found a use for it several times."
1,I never received this product!!,After I ordered this product I received the correct case but the CD inside is AYA CON DIOS NIGHT OWLS! I am very disappointed and have been trying to contact Toll House for this but no one has responded to me let alone send me the correct cd!!!!!!!
4,La Banda 4.40-the best of the best,"This cd is a wonderful compilation of the greatest hits of Juan Luis Guerra's music over the years. I couldn't of compiled it better myself. If you are familiar with and like Juan Luis' music and are looking to have some of his best on one cd this one would satisfy your requirements. I like most of the songs on the album although there are some that are not good as the others. The big hits on this album that seem to always hold strong are: La Bilirrubina, Burbujas de amor, Ojala que llueva cafe, El costo de la vida & Bachata Rosa. However, popularity varies from region to region. But I must say this album has power because in every Latin country that I have visited in the past and present somehow from a store, a car or a house I would hear this album playing and could imagine the joy that it brings to its listeners."
4,"These songs are written by a poet and a trained musician, but I am a bit disappointed.","I love Juan Luis Guerra, and already own several of his records. As a matter of fact, I bought this one because I didn't have ""Ojalá que Llueva Café"" and ""Visa por un Sueño"". I haven't had time to listen to the whole record, but I have most of the other better known songs. Now I have some songs on two different records. If it hadn't been for this last detail, this record would have gotten five stars instead of four."
4,The only reason for not buying this CD,"is having all previous CDs from JLG & 440. Being a huge fan of this music I have all albums released so far so I burned 2 CDs, one w/ merengue the other one w/ bachata + salsa."
5,A must have it!,"If you really love latin music, this is it! No music collection is complete without Juan Luis Guerra. He is a master of latin music."
5,CD,"Looked like new, it plays well, no scratches. It is good to hear the old music the way it sounded when it first came out, and brings back good memories."
3,opt for the bigger dolls,"I bought all five (including Captain Feathersword) of these beanie dolls for my three year old son - the Wiggle fanatic. All of them stopped making sounds after only a couple of days! There is no way to replace batteries, or anything, so once they stop singing, that's it. I give them three stars only because my son continues to play with them despite this flaw. It seems like the reviews for the larger Wiggle dolls are very favorable (I don't have those, so I can't comment) so I would recommend that you spring for them. These little beanies don't last."
4,the loudest band i've ever seen!!,"industrial metal from texas, this is some heavy sh##t,the guitarist from Solitude, so you know its heavy."
5,boxer briefs,"i wear them and am proud, i think they offer a great amount of support and they are really comfortable. the longer leged ones tend to be more comfortable for me. i have had no problems with being made fun of in the locker rooms for wearing them. i think these are worth buying."
1,I like Kittie... but this....,"I like kittie, but their lives songs are just horrible. They seem to try to hard, there is almost no singing on this CD just screaching. They should have stuck to their normal version of their songs, the death-metal type screaming just doesn't go over well from a female. They butchered their own songs!Kittie is kickass band, but this CD just isn't any good. The music video on this CD saves it from being a complete waste of money."
1,I've said it before and I'll say it again,"Kittie are beyond horrid. How anybody can actually listen to this tripe - let alone record it - is unbelieveable. They're ""Here today, gone tomorrow"" - a trend that the record company will milk as much money as they can before droppiung them after their second album flops (which I can almost ga-ron-tee it will) - and believe me, I won't miss them."
2,oh my god,"Well, I'm not a huge fan of live tracks to begin with so I can't be so you may want to take consideration of that before you read my opinion.I didn't find anything enjoyable about these live tracks. The Paperdoll remix is the best song on this EP, but over all the only song that I like on this (live, anyway) is Do You Think I'm a Whore.So all in all, if you must have this, I recommend downloading it or buying it very cheap used.Please keep in mind, I'm a huge fan of Kittie and I love all their albums to death, but this particular EP I didn't like. I like some metal, and I never flame anything. Ever. So please don't think I'm flaming Kittie cause they are kick ass."
4,better than i thought,"i heard the safe ep before this one, and the live tracks on that sucked a lot, so i didnt have very high expectations with this one...but the live tracks are awesome-r than i was expecting on paperdoll..AND of coarse the paperdoll remix...Yay for it because it is very good and has noise in it than the original (by noise i mean more guitars and other noises, like weird clowns laughing and stuff,the remix is the best part of the cd,but its all good)"
2,Interesting Symbolism Saves A Banal Story From Obscurity,"There's something about the American literary critic that seems to equate short and lowbrow with good. At least that's the feeling you get in school when forced to read novels like this one and by authors like Steinbeck and Hemingway. The interesting prose and slathered-thick symbolism livened up this tale of a man who is DETERMINED to have everything. The reason I didn't care about his struggle is because this nouveau riche tycoon just wants the standard stuff: acceptance, $$$ and girls. I guess the moral of the story is that being shallow and possessive can lead to tragic consequences, but duh!, you're already supposed to know that."
4,strong,"pros- nice velocity,small and portablecons-jams from time to time, magazine doesnt hold nothing"
4,Perfect Crema,"The C190 is very easy to use and quick as well to deliver that first morning espresso or cappucine. Very clean and neat with the cartridges and the cartridges I've tried so far have been good. The crema is absolutely perfect--always the hardest thing to achieve at home (IMHO). Would have gotten 5 stars, but always leery of proprietary cartridges......"
3,"Memento Mori, Not-Quite-a-Fan","I found it quite slow in the beginning, but once it began to move, I enjoyed it - but, I have to admit, in small doses. It isn't a book -- at least for me --- that I get lost in and read for three hours without noticing the time. I could forgive that if the writing were gorgeous. But it's okay."
3,Something eerie is happening to a group of elderly friends.,"And the message is that they must remember that each of them is going to die. Their responses to this are interesting. Fear. Denial. Acceptance. Strange, and yet moving. And what would our response be if someone called and told us, ""Remember you must die""?"
4,Remember you must die,"All the characters in Muriel Spark's novel are old people. There is Dame Lettie Colson who is pestered - but perhaps it is an illusion - by anonymous telephone calls with a voice saying only ""Remember you must die"", her brother Godfrey and his wife Charmian who live in a sort of ménage à trois. Their life doesn't get easier as they advance in age: senility and physical decrepitude are handicaps they try to live with, sometimes conscious of them but not always.Then there are the twelve female occupants of the Maud Long Medical Ward, a nursing home, who spend their time gossiping about petty scandals, mostly about wills being rewritten in the favour of another person for some trivial behavioural reason.The plot is both funny and macabre because all the characters are mean, jealous, curious, witty or confused, probably as they used to be all their life. It seems that old age does not transform our character much, for better or for worse."
3,Other Books,"This is the second installment of Nigel Tranter's trilogy detailing the struggles for the House of Stewart, in Scotland. With a weak, dying king, there is a lot of political strife. The point of view character is a young man of limited means, also named James.Not as wet behind the ears here, it shows the problems he has trying to be an honorable man and do the right thing."
1,Quality is horrible!,"The audio quality on this DVD is unbearable! Can't hear the (very monotone) voice one second, then it blasts the voice up high, then back down...this is a crime that a product of this low quality was released. It is more of a lecture than video...very, very disappointed."
3,Not as cool as I thought,"I own lots of these types of bowls and was looking forward to getting one with a lid. It is smaller than I anticipated and the lid won't fit any of the others of the same type.Also, there are raised plastic measurement indicators inside the bowl which are a little irritating when trying to stir the ingredients together.Overall - this product is a good idea but has fallen short of my expectations."
4,Good Remix,"If you are a collector, this disc is worth owning just for the remix of ""Material Girl"" It's a pretty good one and i haven't been able to find it anywhere else."
4,The Human Wash Tag,"This is wonderful and direct reading that can be easily digested by any age. The author uses illustrations to demonstrate and clarify his points. His God-given gift for drawing these illustrations is similiar to those of Clarence Larkin, author of ""The Greatest Book on Dispensational Truth in the World""."
4,So much change; so much is the same,"Anyone who lives in ""The Region"" section of Indiana would enjoy this book. So much has changed since the book was written, but the landscape, weather, and wildlife were there before the author and will be there long after the reader. It's a sweet reminder of how beautiful the world is."
5,A truly heart felt book,"I have hardly finished the book and i already find myself emotionally involved, similing at parts and feeling quite sorry for the family (i think people who have seen me reading it on the train must think i'm crazy with the facial expressions i've had). It has definitely been a great eye-opener to the use of psycholgy. There are more to children than we will ever know :o)"
4,An amazing story,"I read dibs when i was a freshman in highschool. Now a sophmore in college, I need to go back and make reference to this touching book. The book touched upon so many emotions. i think it is amazing how one person can make such a big difference on one child's life."
4,A Good Read,i bought this for a speed reading class and it was a quaint little book. A good book always makes people read through them faster and finish quicker than first expected. The author did such a good job with the story of this boy. it's quite lovely.
5,A classic!,"""Dibs"" is an awesome classic every counselor and/or play therapist will love! And even if you're not in the helping field - its a GOOD read!"
5,very good educational material,"this story is educational in nature but as you read along, you will be moved and touched by the story of this child. Very good reading material"
1,Men shoe from Lady Footlocker???,"I ordered these cleats thinking maybe Lady Footlocker sold mens cleats, not the case. I got a pair of 10's that fit like an eight. They look great, but as a guy, you just can't go around wearing chick cleats..............."
3,Only for fans,"This album is the second released as part of the ""Mole Trilogy"" which was really planned to be six albums. Don't ask. I can't do the math either. The Residents are fond of concepts, and the concept for this album IS an intriguing one. The art group takes the two imaginary cultures from the _Mark of the Mole_ and presents their pop music. The songs alternate between the cultures, from the surrealist big band of the more highly developed people to the very primitive percussive music of the less developed culture. The juxtaposition is interesting, and the instrumental music is at times highly original and entertaining. However, if you're not a fan of the Residents, this isn't one of the first albums you should be buying. Start somewhere else, become addicted and obsessed, and then try to buy their whole catalogue like the rest of us have done."
2,1869 French-Prussian War bore!,"In FIELD OF HONOR you might gain a little insight into the French-Prussian War and the lottery-draft selection that France had in place in 1869,but little else can be gained from watching this dreadfully acted and tedious 1988 film directed by Jean-Pierre Denis.It is very much an 1980's French arthouse film chock full of symbolism framed by a truly bizarre soundtrack that seems to be characteristic of this genre.The story is extremely static and the characters fit the bill.It IS beautifully filmed, though, and for that I can at least give it two stars,but not a farthing more!THE RETURE OF MARTIN GUERRE IS FAR SUPERIOR FILM."
3,opened my heart,"Having followed Dame Madonna since 'Holiday' I am one of those updating their collection to CD, 'Open Your Heart' (this version) is totally 80's and therefore fantastic. It's the 'Hey....are you gonna go out with me or what....scared o' me or something' towards the end that cements it for me as an 80's Madonna lover (and as I was verging on puberty at the time,yes I was!). I had it on vinyl as a child but it had been consigned to the loft long ago due to the digital revolution, but it is the welcome return of a much under-rated old friend. I know people knock 80's overdubs but in their place they did good! although this is one of the longest remixes I owned as a kid, it still is one of the best for nostagia (even though then it was ahead of it's time)I really would recommend this to anyone that likes pop music."
4,"Game good, shipping a little late","I bought this gift for a friends daughter, I was leaving town, but the game said it would ship way earlier than I was leaving, in the end it showed up the day I left which was 5 days later than expected, but at least I was able to give it to her before Christmas. I haven't seen the game opened, but I think it is what it is meant to be."
2,Not Doing it for Me...,"I'm sorry, but I couldn't even get past chapter 3. The characters in this book are not well developed and the story (the part that I did read) was unbelievable. At the beginning, the ""heroine"" keeps quoting scripture about how she'll make it, then tries to kill herself a few pages later?? I found a lot of the dialogue to be quite corny. Maybe someday when I have nothing else to do, I'll finish the rest."
3,Love Like No Other,"It was okay. I think she is a much better writer for teens. I not sure if this is her first adult fiction title. I've read better stories, but this book was average."
4,I Recommend This Book!,"Although there were times when the character Zoe worked my LAST nerve, I truly enjoyed this book. I liked the fact that it was based upon having faith and a true and loving relationship with the Lord. I am a Christian woman, who loves the Lord, and I know that eventhough He is my All-In-All, there will be trials and tribulations and many mighty storms. But this book tells us that through it all, He is there, and if we just give it all to Him, every thing will be all right. Go Jesus!!! You are definitely THE MAN! (Romans 8:28... And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose.) Amen!"
2,Disappointing!,I couldn't relate to these characters. They were so dry and lacked substance. Zoe was too needy and just couldn't seem to get it together for more than half of the book. I didn't finish this book since I reached 3/4 of the way through and it still did not take off. Not this author's best work.
3,Good Christian book...,"This book deals with the struggles of Zoe and Chase, a modern day couple trying to have a Christian courtship in a world that says ""everything goes"". The story is well written and the author didn't compromise on the issue of sex outside of marriage. This is a good book for Christian singles.Reviewer: ES"
4,Too Many Ups and Downs,"It would give it a five stars, but this book had my emotions going up and down. I would still recommend this book to christians folks who was in the ""wordly"" dating game, to let them know sometimes you have to wait to get something very special."
2,A Love' Like No Otha' Book Review,"Overall this book was simply average. The characters at times were too one dimensional and the author's writing style was utilitarian to say the least. Also, cliches were used often throughout the book and the literary concept of space and time was not intertwined with events in the story well.Nevertheless, the romantic plot is captivating enough to satisfy any reader for the few hours it takes to read this book."
5,Definitive explaination of Logical Positivism,"Presents the Logical Positivist posisition that statements about experience must be translatable into terms of our experience to be meaningfull. And then analyses statements about the supernatural, atheism, ""free will"", ethics and other areas.A must read for those interested in the philosophy of science."
2,Doesn't replace history of philosophy!,"I saw the reviews and I think you may be miss-lead. This book does not replaces a good introduction to history of philosophy. It is certain that this books lacks of originality, but he gives the idea that everything is well-established, and he puts everything within his range of classification, which ir really doubtful for someone trying to begin with philosophy.I don't see anything particularly new in this book. He has a scheme to classify others' philosophy. It can be dangerous appealing, in the sense that it tries to remove some of disputes of the philosophers.I would say that is a good protection from the problems of the philosophy, not a good philosophy book. He does not solve the problems, he does not say where is the origin of the problem, or the miss use of the language."
3,Classic popularization of logical positivism.,"This slim volume by Alfred Jules Ayer is probably the single book that did most to popularize the philosophy of ""logical positivism,"" the movement that launched the great twentieth-century assault on speculative metaphysics in general and Idealistic rationalism in particular. At any rate it is still the clearest extant exposition of the basic doctrines of that now largely defunct school (whose influence, however, lives on in analytic philosophy).It gets three stars because Ayer, unlike some of his Continental brethren, wrote clearly enough to be found out. While this book is of tremendous historical importance, its philosophical content should be evaluated only after one has read Brand Blanshard's _Reason and Analysis_, which put paid to the misbegotten ""verifiability theory of meaning"" and demonstrated once for all that logical positivism could not pass its own tests."
2,Miss the Preview Song by Nina Gordon!,"I thought the music was beautiful, but I really wanted the CD for the song ""Tonight and the Rest of My Life."" Was pretty disappointed."
1,The Trailer Song,"For those of you looking to buy this soundtrack because you saw the trailer in the theaters and fell in love with the song that is played, DON'T BE FOOLED! It is not on the CD.The name of the song is ""Tonight and the Rest of My Life"" by Nina Gordon. So go buy her album, not this one!"
1,song in the preview of captain corelli's mandolin,"this is to Mark and Rosie: the name of the song that you are looking for (played in the preview of this movie but not on the soundtrack album) is ""Tonight and the rest of my life"" by Nina Gordon."
1,"Response to ""Misled""","The song that many of you are looking for is by Nina Gordon and is called ""Tonight and the rest of my life"". There is a link to her web page on the Captain Corelli's Mandolin website under ""Trailor"". This is the song played during the trailor. Hope I was of some help..."
3,Trailer Song,"Just to help: the trailer song which is NOT on the CD is called ""Tonight and the Rest of my Life"" by Nina Gordon"
5,An album to touch your heart,"Although the war scenes in the film are quite successful, the film is mostly a love story and 'music' is in the very heart of it. The main theme 'Pelagia's Song' is a very sentimental melody and the album contains different versions of it. The two romantic songs 'Senza di te' and 'Ricordo Ancor' performed by Russel Watson are simply wonderful. The songs are recorded in the order of events that take place in the film, so careful and imaginative listeners can re-live the film as they listen to the CD. Some songs really make one wish to be able to play the mandolin or to be somewhere on the Mediterranean, listening to such melodies. It is the right choice for those who need some peace of mind. A wonderful album for a wonderful romance...listen to it and dream of love..."
4,Preview Song,"For all those people who are looking for that glorious song that is played during the preview of Captain Corelli's Mandolin. After an exhaustive search of the net I found the artist and title, it is by Nina Gordon and is called ""Tonight and the rest of my life "". So enjoy"
4,The song everyone wants to know...,"The song from the promo that was left off the soundtrack is ""Tonight and the Rest of My Life"" by Nina Gordon."
3,Title of the Music From the Trailer,"The title of the song from the trailer of the movie is Tonight and The Rest of My Life by Nina Gordon.I still like this CD although, I wish I knew the title of the song before I bought it."
3,Love the music,The music from this movie is excellent. I only wish they had included some of the Greek Island music the islanders were dancing to.
1,The preview song,"The song Mark D. Kim and Rosie from N.Y. are looking for is by Nina Gordon. It's called ""Tonight and the Rest of my life"""
2,Mislead Also,I didn't go out and purchase the cd yet but as well as Mark.D.Kim I was looking for the song that comes out during the preview because I am getting married and loved the song when I heard it in the movie threaters and was hoping someone could help me find the song so I could play it at my reception. Thank you Mark because if it wasn't for your review I would have made the same mistake and purchase the cd looking for the same song.
2,To everyone who love the song on the preview,"for everyone who bought the cd and was disappointed that the song ""tonight and the rest of my life"" by nina gordon wasn't on the soundtrack i m telling you it's nina gordon. I was searching for it on the internet to find the soundtrack and read that it wasn't there. it saved me a lot of time and money. good bye"
1,the preview song,"this cd is very disappointing. but i did find out the song on the preview. the song on the preview is entitled ""only time"" by enya. you can find it on the sweet november soundtrack or her cd ""a day w/o rain"" hopefully this will help you find the song your looking for"
1,Misleading...,"Thank you Mark and Rosie for your review. I was about to buy this CD, thinking that the song that was played during the preview of this movie is on this CD. If it weren't for your comment, I would have bought this CD for nothing."
5,A MUST READ!!!,"Dr. Savitch has delivered a ""straight talk"" book on a critical issue which cannot be ignored. His book is on target! I have recommended it be ordered for AIDS AWARENESS WEEK on campus. Thank you Dr. Savitch!!"
5,"A Gay reader ""comes out"" of complacency.","After a difficult reading of a well-written and compassionate book, I found my views of AIDS and 'safe sex'changed dramatically. No longer can I live in a complacent comfortable world. AIDS is here to stay and we are all responsible and affected, no matter who we are. The world must change it's legal outlook on this horrible disease and take drastic measures as this epidemic escalates expotentially every day. This is the ""doomsday bug"" and we must protect the future generations. No more greed or selfishness. Dr. Savitch has laid the cards out on the table like no one else before. It is time to take heed."
5,Necessary reading,"This is an important book. Every person who reads it will surely make changes in his/her behavior and have HIV testing whether or not he/she is in a ""risk"" group (as Dr. Savitch points we are all in a risk group). If enough of us read this book, perhaps we can force the recreation of a functioning public health system. Thank you, Dr. Savitch."
1,Silly and pretentious,"The first several chapters of the novel are delightful and historically interesting. This covers Desiree's meeting the Buonapartes. From then on, the novel becomes a piece of sentimental, pretentious, boring schmalzy soap opera as Desiree has nothing to do but hang out on the periphery of Napoleon's court and act important and self-righteous. Her husband has an exceptionally successful career as a French marshall and eventually king of Sweden, but Desiree herself, at least in the novel, becomes progressively sillier and more neurotic. For example, she refuses to live with her husband (until she is in her forties) except in Paris (she doesn't like the clicking of spurs on the floors of palaces abroad, or palaces abroad are too cold for her, or have ghosts). She doesn't even attend her own husband's coronation. The whole thing is too silly for words."
1,Blah,"I expected SO much more out if this book. Nora Roberts tends to be a great writer, but this book was short and dull. Skip it, so on to a better book."
4,My Bianchi Holster from Amazon,"I have tried many holsters for my Glock 27, and the Bianchi Black Widow Hip holster is the best one on the market. I like the thumb snap, and it feels good on your side. I would highly recommend this holster and ordering from Amazon with fast shipping and no hassle returns, to all my Friends."
5,It's just beautiful..,"I purchased one of the cd's by Kohala and fell in love with their music. It is simple, elegant, lovely, very well performed acoustic guitar music. These three guys just do it right. Each one plays a different type of guitar. They blend the different guitar characteristic sounds together very well. I bought all of their cd's. They are all good. Consistant in quality. It is just very nice music to listen to. It has an upbeat feel to it, and yet, it calms and relaxes me."
4,Love this book!,"Don't listen to anyone who is not a big fan of this book. It has everything a children's book should have--good writing, fun illustrations, and a clever concept. Trust me, your kids will love it. Mine do."
1,Paste-up Job proves worthless,"This is a paste-up job from beginning to end, bringing zero new material to the reader. Everything in the book has been written before, with a few anemic observations by the author. A total waste for anyone wanted to expand knowledge of la Davis. ""Fasten Your Seatbelts"" by Lawrence Quirk is far superior. Instead of an exciting read, Walker's tome is like sipping lukewarm tea."
5,ABBA,"I was an ABBA fan in the 70s and early 80s and bought each album as it came out. For some reason, I drifted away from ABBA after the early 80s. As a result, I turned against all music. There was nothing I liked. I found this compilation in a video store in 1989. I rented it. This was what I had been looking for. I ordered my own copy. I must have watched it 400 times in the succeeding years. Videos like Dancing Queen, Knowing Me Knowing You and Take A Chance On Me really hit the spot. ABBA is fantastic!"
1,If you are interested in the people it is OK.,"Title is misleading because it is really a history of the group with only tantilizing snipets of their music, more torture than pleasure."
5,Amazing,"Don't really know what else to say really, amazing...Muslim or not this book from god shows the most perfect way to live your life free from sin, be happy/peaceful and give thanks to your creator for creating you.Font is perfect size and print is good. Not a hardback, but it should last long.arrived maybe a few days late but it was understandable5/5."
4,Quran,"This paperback version of The Qur'an was just as good as any other that I've read, but if you plan to rely on it for daily use, then obvioulsy you'll need to buy one with a more reliable quality - perhaps a leather-cover or hardcover one."
4,"dark roast is good, but this stuff is 'SPENSIVE""","dark roast is good, the milder roasts are undrinkable. the daily cost of this stuff is sky high, and i seem to run out way too fast, even buying 4 packs at a time!what a coffee habit! very nice for an afternoon treat though . . ."
3,Senseo Pods,"These are ok for what they are intended; however, in order to get a decent cup of coffee you must always use two pods, which makes it more expensive to use. I am switching back to a regular 8 cup coffee maker. Shipping time on this product is excuriatingly long - 7 weeks for last order"
2,Disappointed,"I entered a give away program and received a free Senseo coffee maker. It came with mild roast coffee which was just horrible. Since I love a good, strong coffee and drink it black, I ordered the Senseo dark roast pods. I do not understand what other reviewers are raving about. I am disappointed in the flavor of this coffee. I will stick with my locally sold coffee and my coffee press."
4,Great coffee but please label pods,"The Senseo coffee system is an excellent way to brew a good cup of single serve coffee quickly. It takes about 30 seconds so you can easily make another cup. I also like the variety of pods they offer. My favorite is the Kenya blend. The Dark Roast is good when I want a more robust flavor. What I don't like about the Senseo pods is that the individual pods are not labeled with the name of the blend. I would like to put all of my different senseo pods into the same airtight jar for display but I can't do this because I would not know which pod was which blend--they all look the same. So in order to know which pod is which blend, I must keep all the pods in their original packages and since the packages do not seal once opened, the pods can go stale. I suppose I could keep all my opened Senseo packages in a large tupperware container but that is such a hassle and so unattractive."
3,Senseo - Cheaper at Walmart,3.84 a package in Houston TX (Found 1/13/06)Otherwise Senseo is the best coffee I have found in the US
2,Awful coffee,"This coffee is really pretty terrible. If you like your coffee from one of those bus stop machines where they give you a little paper cup with playing cards on them and pour weak dishwater colored coffee, this is the stuff for you. I bought them to use with my Senseo and discovered that even in 'espresso' mode (2 pods, one cup), it was barely drinkable.Much better off buying some Ecopads and grinding your own -- it is cheaper and far better!"
2,"Do not buy this coffee flavor, get something else!!","Maybe it is just my personal taste, but I have tried close to all of the Senseo pod flavors and this is the only one I regret buying. I generally like dark coffee, such as Yuban. However, I will never purchase this flavor for my Senseo again."
4,Good coffee ...IF you use 2 pods...,"Now as the title says these ""dark roast"" pods are great if u use 2 pods , 1 IMHO is not ""dark"" enough... Nice flavor though either way..."
5,"Great coffee, great value","Love this coffee... a nice, smooth, robust cup of coffee with no bitterness.And signing up for Amazon's subscription/automatic shipping program is one of the smartest things I've ever done. It's not only convenient, but it saves me money and time... I get 4 bags sent to my door for what 3 bags would cost in the supermarket, and I don't have to go there and back for them either. Works for me!"
5,The Best Cup oc Coffee in the World!,"The Senseo machine and Senseo dark roast coffee pods produce the best cup or mug of coffee in the world.Consistently rich and flavorsome, this brand of coffee (when used with well filtered water) will put a smile on your face and a happy taste for your libation each day. Better than an expensive mug or cup of commercially brewed coffee from any coffee house, Senseo brand never lets you down.Worth every penny to allow you to enjoy coffee as it should be --- and made at home!!"
3,Dark Roast = Bitter Taste,"First off, I love my Senseo so let's get that out of the way.I like strong flavored coffee but I found the Douwe Dark Roast too bitter with an unpleasant aftertaste. I much prefer the medium roast which is still has a strong flavor without being bitter.Stick with the medium and, here's a secret, you can use the Folgers Home Cafe Coffee pods in your Senseo. I've tried the Home Cafe Folgers Columbian pods and they work fine. Also go to cafepods.com for more cofeee pod varieteis for the Senseo.Enjoy!"
4,Senseo Dark Roast pods,A very rich taste especially with the foam at the top. I almost became addicted to this coffee. I was drinking way too much caffeine. But the flavor is fabulous with lots of body. I have now just talked myself into having a cup.EW
2,Must've been old,"My son said the coffee didn't taste as good/strong as it usually did. In fact, it tasted weak. When I looked at the pods, I realized the pods must've been old, as the newer ones have the word ""Senseo"" printed right on each pod. These didn't. Which is really disappointing as they're not cheap and I now have alot of them."
4,super convenient,"I still like using the Senseo machine and pods. They are super convenient- allowing for just a cup of coffee when I want it and not having to deal with either cooked coffee that has been sitting on the warming tray too long or cold coffee. I use my in the office. It is in a common kitchen area. Several others staff have their own little mini coffee pots and have to do the measuring of how many cups of water and how many scoops of coffee. I just pop in the pop, push the button, and in 90 seconds have a hot cup of fresh coffee.and that is good enough to get started in the morning."
5,coffee,excellant coffee. I can't believe it is so easy to get exactly what I like. Excellant service.
4,Good inexpensive coffee,"The dark roast is good coffee. Never liked the other flavors. Well, the decaf is OK. Super Saver Subscription brings price down to about $0.22 per cup of coffee. And Senseo means it's always fresh. Occasionally one pod in a pack will have ripped open (in transit, or from manufacturer). This makes a mess of the other pods and will result in the occasional extra gritty bits in your coffee. Call Senseo if this happens, and they'll send you a coupon for another bag."
3,lacks flavor,"Not as good as Baronet coffee, flavor lacking.I' glad I tried Baronet, I didn't know I was missing better flavor"
5,I love this coffee,"I love this dark roast coffee! I am not the type of person who buys coffee at coffee shops and such, I just like one cup every morning. This coffee has a nice aroma and rich with a slightly bitter flavor (which is what I like)."
3,No Bargin,"I have to give the coffee itself a good rating. Although I do like the Folgers better. As for the price, each bag is $1.00 (one dollar) cheaper in my local supermarket. Why should I go through Amazon when I can get the whole thing $8.00 cheaper here, and don't even need to worry about shipping?"
5,What a deal!,I'm so glad that I found this subscription offer. It's a great price with no shipping!!
1,Very Unhappy,"The web site says delivers in 24 hours. I have been waiting 7 days, the product has yet to ship and because it is in Amazon's ""shipping soon"" designation, it is impossible to cancel the order. The current estimate is that I will receive my order in 23 days for a product that is in stock and ships in 24 hours. Today I received a notification of a problem with my order but there is no information as to what the problem is.Very dishonest merchant."
4,Senseo Douwe Egberts Dark Coffee Pods,Product is very easy to use to make a single cup of coffee. No more wasteing a full pot of coffee for one cup.
4,Great coffee,"When freshly brewed, this is my favorite coffee. However, it does repeatedly get an after-taste when it cools or sits."
2,so so coffee,"Dark roast coffee is too mild, capuccino is lausiest thing I tested in years. On the plus side the machine works great!"
4,Great quick coffee,"The Senseo coffee is a great easy alternative to the regular american coffee, virtually no clean-up or maintenance. Don't give it a 5 because it is far from a perfect espresso and a little pricey."
5,purchasing senseo coffee pods,I use these pods every day and can purchase them at my local market. The price on Amazon was much more reasonable and was delivered very promptly. They also had a acceptable experation date.
5,senseo dark roast coffee pods,I enjoy this variety when I want a very robust cup of coffee. It has very good flavor.
5,"Senseo Douwe Egberts Dark Roast Coffee Pods,","Senseo Douwe Egberts Dark Roast Coffee Pods, 18-Count Packages (Pack of 4)this is a great product and a great service from amazon"
3,Not the best coffee,"You need to use distilled water w/ these. The flavor is not the best if you use tap water. Even w/ purified and distilled water, NOT the best flavor. However, super quick to make in the morning for a single cup. Do not toss out your high end coffee maker and bean grinder. For the morning, or for the one person at a get togeather who wants coffee, yes, not bad."
2,quantity,I'm not seeing any difference with the pricing of this product. I would like to see an incentive for me to buy again. Everyone I know is looking to ditch the senseo because the coffee is way too expensive. I will keep looking for a better price. Thank you for asking my opinion. Sincerely Josephine D arroyo RiveraP.S the coffee is good but too expensive
5,COFFEE LOVERS CHECK THIS OUT,"IF YOU LIKE GREAT COFFEE FAST, DOUWE DARK ROAST IS THE BEST I'VE HAD. I HAVE A SENSEO COFFEE/POD MAKER AND YOU CANNOT DO ANY BETTER. EXCEPT MAYBE STARBUCKS."
3,good book for fans of the 49ers,"Great Expectations goes into the 1990 season of the 49ers and there quest for a ""three-peat"". It is a nice book, in that it goes into the behind the scenes, that most of us don't get to chance to see. If you are a football fan and want to know about the greatest team in football history then buy this book."
4,Very Well Done,"A Very solid PPV.Sure,some of the tag matches weren't very good but the main event more than made up for it.It showed The Giant as he should, a mean aggressive monster.He was better in WCW than he's ever been in the WWF."
3,THE UNTOLD STORY,"First off Flairs and Sting don't even get it on here...Flairs not even in it!!! The Main Event is horrible with the Giant being very green. The highlight is the BENIOT/SULLIVAN match which is great but with the real life back story makes it a classic. Sullivan was married to Woman, and then she dumped him for Beniot and Sullivan was teh head booker at the time, so somehow this match was booked, its a all ofver the building type match with them wrestling in the bathroom. Its actually one of the best matches I've ever seen, but knowing that there being extra careless with each other makes it all the better. Beniot suplex's Sullivan threw a table for the win. gets into the hourseman right afterwards. AWESOME match. Last WCW PPV without the NWO."
1,WCW Slamboree 1996 review,Big Lipped Alligator Moment? Try Big Lipped Alligator PPV. You think with a tournament like this something would be accompliced but no. The wrestling was second to third rate with only the Cruiserweight & US title matches bring good solid matches but still not enough to save the PPV. The stinker of the tournament was the match between the team of Booker T & Road Warrior Animal against the team of Lex luger & Road Warrior Hawk. The Lord of the Ring battle royal was a rip-off becuase the winner of the battle royal(DDP) was stripped of the his title shot over the fact that despite not bring elimated and only ONE of his feet hitting the floor. STUPID!!! The main event match for the WCW world heavyweight championship between Sting & The Giant was just as bad as the Bret Hart-Yokozuna match at Wrestlemania 9. I give this PPV a 1 out of 10.
2,"Decent matches, but lacked...","The show lacked. Nothing big happend like in most pay per views. ddp, who no one expected to, won the battlebowl. the final battle bowl match was filled with mid carders . they shoudlve put eddie and arn in there, that couldve been cool. konnan vs. liger was decent as was the cw title match. I really liked the main event though."
4,Very exciting,great main event between giant and sting. The under card is ok not great but ok.ddp wins an 8 man batle royal.
3,Sour?,"I'm not sure why these are called ""sour"" balls, but they don't taste sour in the least. They're still pretty good but the name is deceptive."
1,Misleading!,"I saw a green bag as you see, but got delivered a tan..nothing near the bag in design or color!:( Very dispappointed. Please do not buy this.....Its cheating of what they show and what they send.."
3,Good Balanced Information,"My wife and I, who are in our early 50s and have a grown child, were recently considering adopting two young sisters out of foster care. We ultimately (and mutually) decided against it and are comfortable with that decision. The information in this book helped us get a realistic view of what to expect and reach that decision. One caution - it's primarily aimed at potential adopters of very young children, not ""special needs"" (whcih can just men ""older than 2 years"")."
1,not much info--check it out of the library!,"I just paid full price for this book, read it in an hour or so, and came away with very little concrete information. It was very disappointing! Definitely not worth buying. It did not help me in any way to decide whether adoption is for me."
5,TRULY ENJOYABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Initally, I was not too pleased with the stories, as there did not seem to be many REALLY HOT scenarios. Yet, the more I read, the more I wanted to read. The characters and situations are real, genuine and true. I especially appreciate the two stories with the african-american characters and their relationships. I get really bored reading about characters with blond hair/ blue eyes all the time. Nothing wrong with blonde hair/blue eyes but this world is varied and diverse and I can appreciate an author with the courage to depict the world as it is. By the way, Martha Miller's writing style is superb!!!"
5,Desmond and The Specials wear the crown,"Two world-class Ska acts combine to create one of the best two-tone records of all time. Heavy on the reggae, this combo keeps the tradition alive.It's all too easy to get caught up in the beat and sing along. Desmond and the Aces teaming up with legendary band The Specials to create an incredible record. Reggae, Ska, Two-Tone; It's all here, and it's all good. 100% Rude, and 100% Good."
1,have owned for over 5 years,We purchased an earlier version of this item and it started right up and worked fine out of the box. Then some time passed -- by the time it was two years old the rubber components were crumbling and cracking. I put gas in and it leaked back out. The gas lines had cracked and needed replacing. After replacing all the lines and putting in a new spark plug it started right up. However after a couple tanks of gas the plug would need replacing again. In the future I'll avoid this brand as well as other similar cheaply made products.
1,Nothing but problems,"Bought for running a CPAP machine (50 watts max) and laptop computer while staying in a remote area. Ran fine for about 12 hours total on three different occasions. Stopped running. Took into shop, $100 later had carburetor cleaned, new plug and oil, and was told a control board shows sign of wear, the unit may fail at any time. $452 for a new control board, if needed. It ran for another 3 hours. Has quit again New oil is dirty, afraid to look farther.Even when running, it's very noisy, the sound being unacceptable even 100 yards away, it's hard on fuel. And it fails. One gets these generators for power when all else fails. Could have had a Yamaha, less grief and power for what I've put into this."
2,Not Happy,"Mine mysteriously shuts off on me.. runs for about 15 mins, then just stops and won't restart unless it sits.. fiddled with the oil, the air-cleaner, cleaned the fuel-filter, gapped the spark plug.. it runs smoother for 15 mins now, but still shuts off! Had to buy another one, can't figure it out..Also, it's not as quiet as the Honda of the same size.. it is significantly louder for the first hour or so..Had it for one year and one months, used once per week, a total of probably 300 to 400 hours.. if you get lucky and get one without this mystery-problem, I would say it's an okay unit."
1,Kipor Bad Service..DO NOT BUY,The 1000 Watt Sinemaster will blow the $200 circuit board if you approach 800 Watts...not even the 1000 Watt. There is no fuse/breaker...just a 5 second warning with a flashing light only...if you are watching it :-) Exciting products will not answer warranty claims. There is a very poor dealer network.You will be stuck witha $500 pile of junk. DO NOT BUY !!!!
4,A beautiful artistic endeavor,"More about art mediums (glosses, gesso, acrlics) and colorants than actual collage examples.Very good book about ""how-to"". Not sure there's a whole lot more than that here for me personally. The artist shows you some gorgeous collage pages she made, then goes over the four methods used to achieve certain decorative accents or effects. 4-stars for technique coverage.I was inspired by only a few of the examples - Buster Brown, Game Face, and a photo mosaic on page 41. I guess I am more into design and not as much into technique. Just me.Wonderful book on technique from a very good artist's point of view. Not always my cup of tea, but a good resource. I might try a few of the easier ideas. Way too much work for me to mess with such techniques for a one-inch embellishment to a collage or page."
2,Kind of disappointed,"This item looked different than shown in the description; not ugly, but nothing great either. Definitely ran small, in my opinion. I wouldn't buy this again."
4,A great add to your library,"This is one of the most-thumbed books on my shelves (a little less so than ""medium Rudin""). I look here for facts about metric spaces, topological spaces, and the other ""basic"" topics that make up the beginning of the book.Because it's Russian, it's probably only suitable for advanced undergraduates and above. Even though the price has gone up by half since I bought it ten years ago, I'd still recommend it!"
1,seems ok at first glance...,"..but has inadmissable lapses in rigor. The first shock came when this book ""proved"" that every infinite set has a countable subset, without even mentioning that the axiom of choice is necessary for this. In another place, a theorem proof took a set satisfying certain assumptions, removed elements from it according to some procedure, and went on assuming that the reduced set still satisfied the assumptions. This is the general attitude of this text. It's clear and fresh, but the proofs just aren't up to standard. We are dealing with a subject here whose sole purpose is precise aximatization, and painstaikingly rigorous proofs...but this book seems to ignore this attention to detail.Get the text only as a light reading supplement....but don't read it for it's rigor, because there isn't any."
2,Siverman spoiled Kolmogorv,"This is one of many Dover's book where the editor Silverma tryed to ''improve'' the original version of a book.Not having the stature of the authors, the editor failed to understand that no one should try to mess with other's people book."
5,Awesome Real Analysis,"This book is fantastic, starting from set theory and building up real analysis introducing many concepts of functional analysis. It is very well written and I've really enjoyed the proposed problems. I would recommend it to everyone who is attracted to real and functional analysis."
5,A Russian classic,"Well, I only read book in Russian so I am not sure of translation. However, Russian version is classic and is highly recommended."
4,A good book on analysis,"Although an introductory book, it covers most of the fundaments of analysis. That is, from abstract theory of metric spaces through topological spaces and functional analysis. It ends with a somewhat strange presentation of measure theory, but latter it exposes on a simple manner differentiation facts. This is a different and exiting book directed to the somewhat mature reader but not necessarily an analysis expert.The exercises included are illustrative, but they aren't challenging."
4,Not A Bad Book,"I didn't like this book at first because it wasn't what I expected. I think the word ""introductory"" should be removed from the title. It's actually not an introductory book. I would recommend this book for graduate studies. Most real analysis courses at the graduate level focus on the measure theory and integration. However, I appreciate this book more now."
3,High Quality Book,"This book - a fictional bio of Clarence Darrow - was published in 1941 and, even its used condition, was better-preserved than books a tenth of its age. I appreciate the good price and the quality of product and service."
3,"Good, Not Great Herrmann","This is a pleasant pastoral score, with little themes and motifs bubbling around repeatedly for its duration. Melodic bits evoke the New England countryside in which the film takes place, and small stings of drama represent the mystery surrounding the troublesome body. It's all very understated, though, and its fragmented, ""Mickey Mouse"" style of following the on-screen action doesn't allow it to build the thematic heft and dramatic cohesion that all of Herrmann's later Hitchcock scores have. In the humor department, both director and composer would surpass this droll effort with the comedy-of-the-absurd of 'North by Northwest' a few years later. Still, not a bad freshman outing for the duo. Joel McNeely and the RSNO have done their usual first-class job, of course, even if the disc as a whole I'd recommend only to Hitchcock/Herrmann completists (not that there aren't quite a few out there...)."
3,Good,"Gentle Reign made a cross breed of middle of the road pop and acid folk in the late 1960s.Sausalito Heliport is the second album by this band and is a mixed bag. Garnett's vocals are deep and pungent and as a singer she has amazing timing and pacing. The playing by the rest of the band is also excellent.But a pre Sgt. Pepper style of recording psychedelia date this album. Interesting ideas, such as flute and great organ work, run through this album. But the tracks are not roundly mixed: if you think of the sound on those early Country Joe And The Fish albums, this is not that far away. By the start of 1968, Sausalito Heliport probably sounded dated.Still, the music, for the most part, holds, and for that and historic value, this is worth consideration."
2,NOT THE SAME HELIX,"I don't like when hard rockers ""Tone it down"". I really loved this band up until this album. It is way too slow for me and not enough energy. If you really want to hear how this band rocks your ass off, get some of their earlier material and ""CRANK IT UP"". I think after the passing of guitarist Paul Hackman they lost their ability to produce hard rock. Sorry guys, I'm still a long time Helix fan just not of this effort."
3,Decent Helix Album,"There are some decent tunes on this album, but like the previous reviewer, I was disappointed with some of the songs. They just weren't ""Helix"" enough for me... came off sort of weak and underpowered.Helix fans will definately want this one -- as all songs are new and not found on other albums."
1,Wrong item shipped twice when ordering this,"Ordered this DVD for my son, but instead received the Mother Goose Rocks vol. 5 CD. Returned that in exchange for the shipment of the DVD, but instead AGAIN received the Mother Goose Rocks vol. 5 CD. Contacted Amazon customer service and was told that they don't reship an item a third time but that they could refund the price and send me a return label. I guess I won't be buying this DVD."
2,"Not the book I ordered, but almost","I ordered ""Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories"" and I got ""Death in Venice"" without the other stories. Close, but not the same. I kept it because I have to read Death in Venice, but I also have to read Tony Krieger (one of the seven stories missing) which I'll have to find elsewhere. Oh well.."
1,Keep your hands of,"If you haven't heard about Bordermanager, this is your book. If you want in-depth information how these services supported by Bordermanager fits thogether, go to our lab and find the answer. This books covers Bordermanager 3.0 or later so for a general overview, yes, but using as a reference book, better keep your hands of. The step-by-step instructions, entitled as business-cases, are not well explained. I'm a bit disappointet, since the online-help of Bordermanager and the books delivered with the Bordermanager Software have the same level of information. But they're less expensive."
4,Awsome,"This album (released during the ""bad"" era) is a compilation of instrumental versions of Michael's hits from ""Thriller"" and ""Bad"". It includes1 Billie Jean (Instrumental Version)2 Thriller (Instrumental)3 Bad (Dub Version)4 The Way You Make Me Feel (Dub Version)5 Man in The Mirror (Instrumental)6 Dirty Diana (instrumental)7 Another Part Of Me (Instrumental)It is a very nice compilation, BUT it doesn't have Smooth Criminal (Instrumental) from the 7"" Single. PooIts very good though!"
1,Not worth your time or money.,"Thanks to Amazon, I only paid a penny for this book plus shipping. I'm less insulted by any monetary cost than the timethat I spent reading almost a third of the 300 pages presented here, thinking that the reviews couldn't have been that""off"". Antecedents are crossed, mixed up, or nonexistent. There is no poetic merit in the awkward sentence constructions.The story lines lose impact when the language of each story is so disorganized. I can not recommend this book and wonder atthe other favorable reviews. I do not agree, and would never recommend this book to a friend.Note that: this book was originally published in French, so I can not see whether (a) the backwards constructions existed in French,or (b) the translation into English lost original meaning and morphed the book into something awkward and uncomfortable to read.Perhaps the original French doesn't have all the problems. Obviously, this review is about the English version."
3,Mistaken,"I bought this product so that my Grandson could work on some of his gaming devices. To his disappoint the shafts were not long enough. I should have read the details closer before buying. I'm sure it's probably a good product, but not for what we were going to use it for."
1,not what I ordered,"The item I previewed, then ordered, online was a 5 sided security bit. What was delivered was a set of 6&7 sided bits. I guess the description given online should not be trusted and I need to physically see and hold what I need to make sure it is what I want to purchase.Not a happy camper."
5,Usefull Tool,"I needed to upgrade the memory on a computer that I got at an auction but it had the little weird fasteners that I couldn't figure out. After a little research i found the name of the screw being used and sure enough, Amazon.com had them ready for me. Great for people who tinker with electronic components and do-it yourselfers"
2,Missing / duplicate piece,"I used this to take apart a bunch of hard drives and that's when I noticed that this was missing a size 8, and instead there were two size 9 torx bits. That's the main reason I rated this 2 stars instead of 4. (see picture)They bits do fit well, but if you come across a tough screw and need to crank hard on the smaller bit sizes, the metal is malleable enough that it will change form. (see picture). I wouldn't take any points off for that, I think that just comes with the territory on such an inexpensive product."
5,Great Buy,Needed and only used 1 of these bits really. That was to take apart my xbox controller. But this has become quite useful and I recommend this.
2,Bits broke immediately,"I bought this for its largest bit size. I attached the bit to the adapter and then to my wrench and with a quarter turn, the bit broke off into the screw. LAME!"
2,Reminder that T5 & T6 bits are not security bits,"Although the item is called a ""7 piece security bit set"", note that the T5 & T6 bits are not security bits (i.e. no hole in the center). I wasn't sure which size torx security bit I needed to disassemble a Microsoft mouse so I was hoping for the best when I ordered this, but unfortunately it turns out that the mouse requires a T6 security bit that this set doesn't have."
3,nice product,not really much to say. nice product and it serves it's purpose. good price. . . . . . .
3,Too Stubby,"Bought these for the repair of Xbox 360 controllers, but the shaft was too short to make the trip down the depths of the remotes recessed screws. Other than this they seem OK."
3,Okay security torx set - doesn't work on xbox 360 controller,I bought this set to enable me to fix my xbox 360 controller but the bits are not long enough to reach 2 of the screws in the controller. if this is your purpose you would be best off getting one of these instead.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002G9MHY0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B002G9MHY0&linkCode;=as2&tag;=stupisms-20
2,Returned It,I ordered this kit because I needed the T5 to fix a cell phone. When it arrived the only piece that was defective was the T5! Ugh! Luckily Amazon makes returns easy but unfortunately I'll have to buy from a different vendor.It was as if the bit never got molded and was a solid blank piece and was bigger than the T7. I'll order a different set that's on Amazon and I should be good.I gave it an extra star since it was actually a decent looking kit if I had use for the others.
4,The Land Before All The Sequels,"This is one of the better films made for kids. I watched it a ton when I was younger, and can now admit that I was positively terrified of Sharptooth.Unfortunately, they couldn't stop making sequels. Now, our prehistoric heroes have been reduced to a bunch of computer generated dinos, prancing around singing annoyingly about diversity.See the original. It's much better."
4,Great movie for kids,"I purchased this movie for my 4 year old son and 3 year old daughter. It's a hit with both of them. Although the animation seems a bit outdated, the kids don't know the difference, and they love the characters and the storyline."
3,They should be ashamed,"This is the first of a long string of animated adventures that appeal to kids of all ages. The juvenile dinosaurs have distinctive character traits and are all, in their own unique ways, quite lovable -- even the grouchy, touchy Triceratops ""Cera"".So how in the world could the ""Anniversary Edition"" of this premiere episode be so poorly put together? The digital transfer is so spotty and irregular that it almost appears to have been pieced together from a collection of damaged VHS tapes. It's one thing to have to scrounge for a good copy of an old movie, but this title is much too recent for this to be the best image available.This household gives this DVD edition 5 stars for content and 1 star for quality."
2,Land Before Time,"The price was reasonable and I was very excited when the movie arrived early. However, it was damaged when I opened it."
1,No Widescreen,This is a great family movie. The original and by far best of the series. I would probably give it 4 stars if a widescreen option was include. It is ashame that this classic had to be cut up like this. It is ashame that so many people think that widescreen is to good for kids. When an anamorphic widescreen version is released I will buy it and give it a better review. Also some supplements of some kind should be included also.
3,Poor picture quality,"This is a great movie but I have to agree with other reviewer, the picture quality is poor. My kids still love the movie though, they're too young to be critical about the quality. I bought ""Land before time 2"" and the picture quality is much better, you don't have to watch all scenes details and to be picky to see the difference between both of them. Customers expect a little more from an ""Anniversary edition""... they could have done better..."
4,good family movie,"got this for my 3 yr old grandson, he is just getting to understand more things and he enjoyed this movie which my daughter likes watching with him"
5,Great niece loved it,The Land Before Time was one of my sons most favorite shows when he was growing up and I hope this becomes one of hers as well
5,Still going strong,"I first saw this movie in the theater and saw it many more times on VHS. I may be an adult, but this movie still has the same effect. It is the only movie to ever make me cry.The part with Littlefoot's Mom was very well done and remains one of animations saddest momments next to Disney's Bambi. I know have this movie on DVD and it will be a timeless classic."
5,One of Don Bluth's few best movies,"""The Land Before Time"" is another animated movie that people should see. Don Bluth has almost always picked the right unknown actors to do the voices in his movies. Here, Gabriel Damon {Littlefoot}, Candice Hutson {Cera}, and Judith Barsi {Ducky} are no exceptions. They all voiced their roles with unique talent. They gave humor, emotion, and great charm to their characters. Perhaps the greatest wonder and beauty of this movie is the music by James Horner. It is considered by many people to be one of his best scores. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg produced this movie, and they are the reasons for you to see this movie. Four powerful names in Hollywood-Lucas, Spielberg, Horner, and Bluth-and you have got a very good movie."
5,A Classic,"I remember watching this when I was younger and enjoyed it. Now that I am an adult, I still enjoy this movie as I am a huge fan of dinosaurs -- mostly T-Rex, though. That said, during the last half of the year last year, I found out my 3 y.o. nephew was, too, a HUGE fan of T-Rex and dinosaurs. I asked my sister if she ever rented this movie for him to watch, but her being as forgetful as she is, never did. I took a chance and bought this movie for him (as well as my nieces who are too young to hold any attention to this) for Xmas. Turns out, he had watched this movie on Xmas day 5 times, and 4 to 5 times every day since then. To say he enjoys this film immensely is an understatement! I think this film also shows a positive message about friends arguing, but how to work through those arguments, teamwork, as well as a little glimpse on what may have happened to the dinosaurs. If a child in your life is a ridiculous fan of dinosaurs, you simply cannot go wrong with purchasing this DVD."
4,Great for 3 year old,My grandson really loves this movie--I had it on VHS and liked it so much I got the DVD
4,Nice kids movie,"My kids, aged 3-7 love to see this film over and over again. Not much violance, fortunately but also to too 'soft'."
5,Love the original!,My son just started with the LBT movies so he watched this one out of sequence. This one and #5 are his favorites. Fun fun.
1,Where's My DVD??,"Though the DVD arrived promptly, its rightful owner (I gave it as a gift to my godson) went to open the case and there was no disc! Since it was sealed, there was a pretty good chance that the seller wasn't at fault for this mistake. She was willing to refund my purchase, but it took some convincing. My advice? Make sure you're getting everything you paid for before you buy. I know it's pretty hard to do with a sealed DVD, but make sure you're working with a seller who will refund your purchase."
1,Scary for small children; contains name-calling and teasing,This series of videos is scary for young children. Do not let the G rating fool you. I watched the video with my three year old son who loves dinosaurs and he was scared during several of the scenes. Also there is a lot of name-calling and teasing in the videos. Not something I want my child learning. Very poorly done story lines. Pick Dinosaur Train or Dino Dan instead!
2,save yourself the trouble...,This is by far my least favorite in the Land Before Time series. It's too dark in my opinion for a children's movie with a very heavy story line. Save yourself the pain and watch the much more upbeat sequels with your kids.
1,"Um, it's okay......","I know alot of people think this is the best one out of all of them, but I think this is too intense, and Little Foot seems snobby in this sequil. I am glad they made more of these movies. (...)I know there are many other older people who love the series."
1,Bad,Ordered this product over a month ago and still have not recieved it. Not happy with my purchase at all.
2,Not like the others,"Those who like this DVD seem to have fallen in love with the movie years ago when it was first released in theaters.We, on the other hand, first discovered the many sequels and then watched this disappointing original. The problem is that they are nothing alike. The sequels are bright, lively, sing-along affairs. The original is somewhat dark and brooding.If you have a toddler who likes the lively sequels, you can skip this one. Don't let the Spielberg-Lucas names fool you into thinking this will be even better. It's not better, just very differentHow does the movie rate on it's own merits? Enjoyable, if you're not a 2-year old looking for singing dinosaurs. And if you're not, there are still shortcomings. The overall look of the DVD release seems dirty and old. The instrumental score is melodramatic, and the animation is a bit cliche': the kids are lost in a world full of shadows and thorns, shadows and thorns. Yuck!"
5,a family favorite,glad I could still find a copy of this on dvd. our vhs copy has long since worn out from repetative watching by our children when they were young.
1,SCANDALOUS !!!!!,"This release is neither widescreen nor anamorphic. It does have DTS & DD audio. Therefore I rate this DVD only one star although the movie itself is great. Universal studios:""shame on you!""."
2,Picture quality not so great!,"This is one of my FAVORITE Movies! I had the VHS saved for my little one when he was old enough to see it...then I put the VHS in and BOOM, the darn player ate the movie I had for 15yrs! So I purchased this DVD, and I was so surprised when the quality really was that of a VHS. I have many DVD's and this one is 'almost' as bad as when we do play a VHS tape (yes I still have those as I have 35 Disney movies I dont have the money to get DVD's of). The dvde only includes the movie and chapter selections.Being and 'Anniversary Edition' you would think the quality would be better. Its very grainy, dark and doesnt look very good. Not impressed!"
1,Land Before Time- Anniversary Edition,"I wouldn't recommend this movie until it gets remastered. It was of very poor quality. I can't wait until they remaster this movie, I loved it as a child and would love to watch it again. This edition is very scratchy looking and the sound/visual, leaves something to be desired."
1,"Perfect movie, but a t horrible DVD","Don Bluth's masterpiece, as if it hadn't had enough assualt with the endless terrible sequels, is now forced to endure another indignity: this DVD release. The original fans of this movie are grown up now, and the publishers should realize this and release a version with actual extras. Widescreen, commentary, and storyboards, to name just a few, would be wonderful. It would help if they cleaned up the picture, too; my 15+ year old VHS copy has better images."
5,Best cartoon ever,"Man , I never rate cartoon movies but I would have to say this movie is the greatest. Like others have said, I at the age of 23 still can;t fail to drop a tear thur parts of the movie. Duckey is the greatest in this movie. And Spike doesnt have to rush for anyone. Sarah is cold hearted but shows her inner side as we all will at some point in our life. This is a good motivational tool for kids to grown-up. I recommend it for everyone to see. Dont miss out. Its like Scarface,"" a classic"""
3,Not as good as I remember,"I loved this movie as a child, but watching it again now its kind of boring.The video quality was good. There was definitely some heartfelt drama, and the characters were cute. Maybe save this one for the little kids who love dinosaurs and need to learn life lessons about friendship."
1,god-awful,"This was a real disappointment. It has the look of a made-for-TV film and perhaps it was. I don't care to find out. But the small numbers of soldiers in the ""battles"" and the small and cheaply made sets remind me of that terrible cyclops in Rome made-for-TV show with poor old Eric Roberts looking as out of his element in that one as Powers Boothe looks in Attila. Boothe looked so wrong for the part he might as well have been wearing a leisure suit in Brooklyn instead of Roman leather and metal and I was surprised at how bad his acting was. And other casting was terrible right down to warm, loving, sensitive, blue-eyed Huns. Nearly the entire show is about the personal animosities of various individuals. More of a soap opera than an epic. There's even a character who uses sympathetic magic to suffer the wounds of Attila at a distance! Garbage is the best word for it."
1,Attila the Rock Star,"I didn't know Attila was tall blue eyed sexy and had rock star hair. I thought he was short, squat, ugly, sadistic, cruel and very shrewd. Well, I guess if this was historically accurate no one would watch it. Enjoy."
3,Attila,"Although well made, the film was a bit long. I was bored and left the room more than once. Unless you have a serious crush on Gerard Butler, it totally won't be worth it.Don't bother with this one."
4,Attila - Nice Period Epic,"Attila was a 2001 mini series which won the honor of being the most watched mini-series of its day. It features a stellar cast including Powers Boothe as a crafty Roman leader who tries to use Attila to gain possession of Rome.Gerard Butler is Attila, the Hun,and he is everything about Attila in this role, never was an actor better suited. His character is sharp, passionate, determined and has an instant magnatism that keeps the viewer glued to the film. He brings a strong intensity and subtle gentleness to the character which makes watching him clash with Boothe even more dynamic.This is a definite watch for anyone that likes period piece drama or just really well staged war scenes."
5,Attila,"Overall a pretty good movie, though unfortunately the Romans were often stereotyped, and the realities of the a fifth century heavily Christianized Rome were almost entirely absent, in the interest of scandalizing their legendary illicit behaviors. The battle scenes seemed hampered by a lack of funding, and the Roman legions suffered from many anachronisms, probably noticed only by interested parties and/or classicists like myself. Irregardless, it was a very entertaining movie from start to finish, and I recommend it highly. It is interesting how often it is that the victims of imperial ambition are not soldiers, but the common people caught in the middle."
2,Ridiculous and silly,"I rented this movie because of Gerry Butler, and even though I think he's a terrific actor, this film is so silly. His scottish accent pops in and out. The story doesn't make a whole of sense. It comes off like a soap opera with over acting, and drags through most of it. Guess that's what you get with made for tv. Despite all this, if you're a Gerard Butler fan you should definitely see it because he's beyond gorgeous as Atilla. The man's sex appeal is never ending - even in a terrible film such as this."
4,"""Empires Expand Until Someone Is Strong Enough To Stop Them"" ~ The Politics Of Warfare","""Attila' released in '01 is a superb made-for-televsion film dominated by two military juggernauts, Attila the Hun (Gerard Butler) and Flavius Aetius (Powers Boothe) commander of the Roman legion. Gerard Bulter casts an imposing and gallant figure as Attila, probaly presenting him in a better light then he deserves. In several sequences, especially when he's wearing white, he appears almost Christ-like.Powers Boothe on the other hand is devious, scheming and will use any means at his disposal to gain power and control within the Roman Court. Rome is definitely portrayed as the bad guy in this production.All and all an enjoyable film about ultimate power and the difficulty involved in retaining it."
3,Attila The Man,"Lots of violence, you could tell when and where the commercials were originally placed. And why would anyone want to make Attila the Hun a sympathetic character? Especially after killing farmers, women and sometimes children?Well it was interesting to watch once again the very charasmatic and really handsome Gerard Butler. The real treat was watching the special features. If you purchase this video, no small children and be prepared to spend 4 hours infront of your DVD! Better still spread the action over 2 days."
4,Get this one!,"Once you watch this movie, trust me, it will get you through any history lesson on Attila! Thoroughly thought-provoking, and several deep issues are brought up. Not to mention engaging, and simply a thriller!"
3,Cable movie ... HO HUM,"If the real Attila saw this movie, he would **** a spear.It passed the time, but was so inaccurate & blase.Watch Pathfinder or Westender or Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King instead;)I just watched Mongol.way better ...At least Kevin Sorbo isn't going to jump up & smack U down ..."
3,"An interesting film, not bad eye candy either . . .","I watched this movie with my husband, and we both had questions about the choice of a Scot to play someone who was supposedly Asian -- though after researching a bit found that Attila was probably a little closer to Serbian or Russian than what we now think of as Asian, so I guess it wasn't so far off; and Gerard Butler's make up did help to make him look more 'exotic'. Otherwise, we thought it was pretty close to being historically accurate, except that it softened the Hun leader's personality quite a bit. And the death scene was a bit contrived. Don't think I would have bought it had I been able to rent it first, but never saw it available in the video stores. Nice to be able to sit back and look at Mr. Butler whenever I please, however . . ."
1,Dismayed,"I bought this movie mainly because the reviews I read on Amazon, good God people, are you from Mars or someplace? Anyone who rated this movie a good picture has an incredible insane sense of good. This is possibly the worst picture ever made. Terrible directing, mostly pitiful acting, the graphic scenery is beyond exceptionaly poor. We are talking about Rome people, not Pittsburg, what was supposed to be one of the spectaculars of all time was made to look no greater than Hoboken. The warriors and soldiers that are supposed to be impressive, imposing war like hard men, look like a bunch of knock kneed old men from nursing homes. No wonder the U S of A is having such problems, A large percentage of our people do not know up from down."
4,Attila,"This is a very good movie. It is a movie about a man named Attila who is the leader of the army. He is the leader of the Huns. He Beleives the huns are the greatest people of all. Kind of like hitler, but not as evil.When he was just a little boy his parents are killed. Thats when he gets really mad. He falls in love with a girl thats part of the enemy and tries to defeat rome. A very good movie.If you liked: The Patriot, Braveheart,or Gladiator. This would be a really good movie."
4,Good Action Flick,"I love sword/adventure action movies so that is my angle. This is a pretty good movie although I don't know how historically accurate it is. The acting is pretty good and there are plenty of intrigues and family position battles. Attila is pretty ""white"" looking and does not come as across as very ""menacing"". A more brutal asiatic lead would have made a better Attila.This has the same look and feel as the ""Odyssey"" which was also a TV mini-series. The battle scenes of Huns vs Romans (with Visigoths sprinkled in) were pretty good. All in all a pretty good sword/battle movie that provides some insight into that turbulent period of history."
4,DVD,"This was a gift to my best girlfriend, She loves Gerard and the CD is not to bad we both really enjoyed it."
5,Atrila,"I loved Gerard Butler in this. The film did not follow history too well, but plenty of action."
3,"An intense Attila, arrogant and brooding.","Television is making bold strides in its competition with the big screen, making powerful, big-budget movies and mini-series such as The Mists of Avalon and, now, Attila. It's possible to quibble over details of history -- no film ever seems to get it right, and this one plays extremely loosely with numerous facts about Attila and his era -- but this is a dramatic, colorful production sure to please anyone who loves tales of epic conflict. The battle scenes are undermanned but are well executed and convincing, particularly in the final 30 minutes of the three-hour saga. There is also a great deal of pageantry, with excellent costumes and sets and a lush setting for the tale. But this story doesn't end on the battlefield and, while some will say the final portion is anticlimactic, it does add a historically accurate wrap to events."
4,Attila,"What can I say...........it is Gerard Butler !!A very sad tale of love and loss, deception and revenge on a man who had the interest of his people at heart."
3,ATTILA,I did not think this movie lived upto the description and star rating it lift me doubt about where it was going.
5,A COWBOY ROMAN WOW!,"i give this five stars for the action and battles scenes. i alsolike powers boothe, its hard not to like him even if a roman general has a southern accent. i just want toknow when hollywood will use a roman citizen in italy to playancient romans."
4,"""absolutly fantastic""","great and wonderful movie that you will watch over and over again. I loved it amazing, a must see movie."
4,Attila,"I love it. I think Gerard Butler is amazing. His talents are endless! I don't know why we don't see more of him. His portrayal of Attila was so well balanced; so complex, so divided. Tyrant on one side, tender on the other. You could feel his emotions. He is truly on his way up!"
5,SheeBee,"Honestly my initial attraction to owning this DVD was Gerard Butler. He is smoking!!!!!! hot!!!! He also happens to be a fine actor who obviously works very hard at his craft. Although the story was not completely historically accurate (I am fairly certain the real Attila was not as considerate of the women he owned), I enjoyed the acting. Powers Boothe was very good as well. The friendship/conflict between his character and Attila was very interesting.I don't think I will ever think of an adult man and a diaper the same way again. Did I say Gerry Butler was smoking hot!!!! He was the reason I bought the DVD, but all performances and production made the entire story quite interesting. No disappointment here."
3,Attila the Scot,"The movie(or in reality mini-series), was alright, I guess. It certainly was no worse than many of the historical epic films that have been made over the years. The cinematography was good. The story wasn't that bad, really. The battle scenes were well executed. It was a movie that could have been terrific but wasn't.First of all, Gerry Butler, a 6'2"" scotsman played Attila, who was reportedly short, squat and dark. Butler was very good at roaring, growling and fighting, but seemed to be somewhat wooden when it came to the quieter moments of his role. This includes his love scenes, I might add. It may not be Butler's fault, as no one else seemed to be coming across well either. The dialoque didn't help. The crowning downer, though, was the music, which seemed to be pirated from bad 1960's epic movies.Despite the above critcisms, I did enjoy watching the movie...once. It's not anything I'd want to sit through again."
5,Buddy Rich Lost Tapes DVD,"A wonderful last snapshot of the unbelievable talents of Buddy Rich. A delight to watch and listen to, a must for Buddy Rich fans. If you want to see the ultimate perfectionist, a master at work, watch this! Swings like crazy!"
3,Good but not detailed,"This is a book typical of this series: a survey of the unit's operational life, interesting, but a quite dry reading. A good starting point, don't expect nothing like Don Caldwell's JG26 books. For modelers: as usual the color plates are superb."
5,All Eyes On Europe!,"I was absolutely amazed at the powerful truth offered up in this book. It has clearly changed my life and the life of my family. At a time when all eyes are on Afgahnastan and the terrorist attacks, it is very clear that we should all be also looking at Europe and the way it is uniting. The bible states it so clearly that this will take place before the end, but it truly takes a genius like Mr. Adams to put the pieces together and show us all this plain and simple truth. Well actually it doesn't take a genius to figure it out once all the pieces are put together. Europe has tried to unite continuously since the fall of the Roman Empire. Napoleon tried it. Giribaldi tried it. Mussolini tried it. And Hitler tried it. After centuries of wars that were unsuccesful, now this prophesy is happening in a presently subtle manner. This book makes everything so crystal clear, I wish I had read it years earlier. A must read for anybody interested in the future of the world."
5,MUST READ,"I have studied bible prophesy for more than 25 years and if i had this book with me when i started, i would not have taken so many wrong turns on my journey.....This simple,clear and concise little book is full of bone jarring,and eye opening information that exposes what some of us have known for years....Forget all the famous prophesy writers and the speculation that they try to substitute for fact.....Adams makes a very strange and clouded book of the bible become clear as a noonday sun....Buy this book!!!!!!!It is worth the price and more"
1,Save your money,This is a very poorly done book from a prophecy perspective..it is fairly well written..just totally off base as far as prophecy is concerned. He does a good job exposing some of the occultic practices in the Catholic Church but you can learn about that for free at many sites on the net...the rest of it is a waste of time.
2,Badly Done,A pretty juvenile approach and poor research undermine this book. The author lacks insight and his conclusions are too often complete nonsense. Just about any other book on this subject is superior.
1,Silly,"Oh pooh and poppycock, say I. This is a silly book. And scary, because, no doubt, some very easily tempted people are going to pay attention to it. Silly and scary... not a good combination."
5,Eye Opening and Life Changing,"This book will change your life and your perspective. It will increase your level of knowledge about 666, the beast, and the Bible in general 1000%. A must read for everybody."
5,Is the KJReader a Schizophrenic or What?,"I don't know what the one reviewer named kjreader is talking about, it sounds like he's rambling on like a schizo, but I have read this book my Canyon Adams and I say for the record that it is 100% on the money. Canyon Adams points out the fallacies and the delusions of organized religion, including and maybe even ESPECIALLY the Catholic relgion. He points out the Beast. And he points out how we all need to be looking at Europe to watch it merge with the middle east and become a super power like the world has never known. A UNITED EUROPE is the beast; it is the revived Roman Empire. Read Daniel 2 and 7. Read Revelation 13 and 17. Rome! Rome! Rome! Canyon Adams is so correct and on target it's almost frightening. I tell all readers to buy this book and learn."
1,Can you say A-P-O-S-T-A-C-Y ???,"This book is not an intelligent work of research. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody because it is inaccurate, unbiblical, and sometimes just plain stupid. These other reviews are obviously rigged, or else they describe a completely different book from the one that I read. This book was a waste of my time. It was a juvenile attempt at a subject best left to more intelligent, talented and well spoken authors. Sorry, but this one doesn't even qualify for my ""two thumbs down"" rating."
5,A cereberal assualt on traditional religious beliefs,"This particular book is very well written and easily read. This is a powerful book. I read it in three hours. I simply couldnt put it down (not even to use the bathroom). If you read this book then you are going to need a highlighter so you can mark certain spots and research this info for yourself. While I do not doubt that this author is correct in his writings, I will study it for myself. I urge that every reader do the same. Especially before you write a review.If you are a Christian (especially a catholic) this book will shock you. I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to expand their understanding of the book of Revelations.BUY THIS BOOK, READ IT, GIVE IT TO YOUR PASTOR TO READ, AND BUY COPIES FOR YOUR FAMILY. BUT MOST OF ALL, DO THE RESEARCH FOR YOURSELF."
1,Weak.,"This book is mostly fluff. I didn't find much useful information in it. I like to try new authors once in a while, but I guess sometimes it pays to stick with those writers you know and respect.I didn't feel that there was a great deal of research or professionalism in ""666"", and I found it very hard to stick with my rule of always finishing a book once I start reading. Maybe someone else will find this book informative. I didn't."
1,What's up?,"This book was terrible! How can there possibly be any favorable reviews here?""The Beast Revealed"" read like a poorly written nursery school primer. I can't see that any research went into it. The conclusions drawn were ludicrous and off-base. I tried to finish reading it, just because I'd spent money on it, but it was a waste of my time. Don't buy this book. That's my opinion and advice.And one other point I'd like to make is that in review number 47 the author disputes the previous review by saying that it was written a day before the book was distributed, but the review before THAT one--the very first review--was written ten days before the one Mr. Adams disputes. Huh?Whatever. These reviews are mostly silly. Don't waste your money on this book."
2,Beauty is pain,"I have to wear multiple pairs of socks as to not get blisters on my heels and the tongue of the shoe is extremely stiff and painful against my tendons. Though, on the bright side, they do look good. These are a prime example that beauty is in fact pain."
5,Wild at Heart...steal your Heart,After watching series 1 (which was bought on a whim) I just had to purchase series 2. It is a great series!!! The stories are fantastic and leave you with wanting to see more. The acting is heartfelt from the adults to the children.Hoping that the next sets (which are all non-usa region) will be out soon for our enjoyment in the USa.

5,"dark, sexy, and relevant","U2 claimed at the end of Lovetown they were going to dream it up all over again. They did so like a Christian going Atheist. They took the heart on the sleeve approach and trashed it. Actung Baby is a deck of cards, four men chopping down the Joshua Tree. From the Sonic blast of Zoo Station To Love is Blindness, they never let up throwing dark sexy, and rich music at you with the most complex of lyrics U2 has ever written. This is a heavy record, and will never be fully realized in one listening. U2 will continue to improve on this."
5,The pinnacle of 20th century music,"If Elvis and the Beatles suggested what popular music could become, then U2 became it and this album proved it. The rich textures that comprise these songs never become more important then the songs themselves. The lyrics sharply bring into focus details from an itensely hypnotic enviroment. Listening to the words is like listening to your friend confiding in you. The genuine doubt expressed within this masterpiece has given me faith. It is beatiful music."
2,"""One"" plus 11 other songs","Give yourself a lift...""One"" is the only GREAT song here. The rest of the album is pretty forgettable."
2,THE MOST OVERRATED ALBUM OF ALL TIME?,"OK. Maybe not. There's some OK stuff here. No songs though. It's probably better than Pop. It's certainly better than Enya. Bono chooses not to sing this time out, and the rest of the band tries to compensate with effects. It doesn't work."
5,Simply Amazing!!!!,"I can't say I am a true U2 fan. In fact, I am more a Reggae fan. But I do own four of their albums. Good music, after all, is good music. And these guys are incredible. The albums I own are: The Joshua Tree, Rattle and Hum, All That You Can't Leave Behind (ATYCLB)and, quite recently, I bought Achtung Baby.About Achtung Baby: the style is different from The Joshua Tree and ATYCLB. But this is an exceptional album. All the songs are good. All except ""One."" ""One"" is an EXCEPTIONAL song. Perhaps their best song. Period. You cannot help but be moved by this song. The album would be worth its price if that were the only good song on it.But there are 12 good songs here. My personal favorites besides One are: So Cruel, Mysterious Ways, Love Is Blindness, and Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around the World.I don't think there is anyone out there with Bono's gift for writing lyrics. And his voice is in top form on this album. Look, I can go on and on. Just get this album. You will not regret it."
5,One of the best albums of all time...,"U2, the most meaningful and productive band of the past 20 years, reached its musical height with this astounding album. For me, the signature song remains ""One"" -- which recently was featured as a tribute to unity on the Tribute To Heroes telethon to benefit the firefighters, police officers and others who died in the terror attacks of 9-11-01.The attacks have been hard on everyone, but bands like U2 have helped us deal with the mindlessness of that day. In fact, we need U2 now more than ever.Lyrically, the songs on War and The Joshua Tree have more power for me, but from a musical standpoint, U2 has never been better."
5,Best Rock album.... ever!,"This is quite possibly the best rock and roll album of all time. This album is a must have for true rock fans. It contains the great rockers ""Zoo Station"", ""The Fly"", ""Even Better Than The Real Thing"" and ""Mysterious Ways"". It also has great ballads, such as the immortal ""One"", ""Love Is Blindness"", ""Whose Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses"" and ""Trying to throw your arms around the world"". This album led to one of the greatest rock tours of all time, the Zoo Tv tour (which I highly recommend you buy in addition to this album). This is a classic album which remains timeless and inspiration even after a decade has passed since it was released."
2,The beginning of a terrible decade for U2,Some great songs. A lousy album. Nothing in the middle. I liked U2 better when they weren't so slick. I never understood U2 in the 90's. Much better now.
2,sorry people its true,"My friend owns record store, and one day we started arguing over who is the most overrated rock band of all time. We usually never agree on anyhting, but we both firmly agreed that the winner of THE MOST OVERRATED ROCK BAND OF ALL TIME went straight to U2. Sure theyve got a couple of good songs, but that hardly puts them on the summit of great artists. We asked a few customers who walked in the store for thier opinions on the subject, and I was shocked that every single customer ages 15 to 45 thought we were right. So my hat is off to you U2, you certainly deserve the title: MOST OVERRATED ROCK BAND OF ALL TIME."
1,Damaged Cd.,The CD was sent in a paper envelope. He arrived on time but damaged and the CD All That You Can Live Behind arrived damaged. You could have sent a more secure packaging. I did not approve.
2,"1 good song doesn't make a classic, don't make me laugh.","Here's to the most overrated band in the history of recorded music. Boo, you suck. If Bonehead wasn't hob-nobbing with the pope or leaders you wouldn't have this MTV hype driven nonsense top polls and fool people into thinking they matter.I leave you with an excellent commentary by the ever wise, George Harrison: ""You know what irritates me about modern music, it's all based on ego. Look at a group like U2. BONO and his band are so egocentric... The more you jump around, the bigger your hat is, the more people listen to your music... The only important thing is to sell, and make money. It's nothing to do with talent. Today there are groups who sell a lot of records and then disappear immediately. Will we remember U2 in 30 years? I doubt it."""
4,Achtung baby for my baby,"It was a gift for my girlfriend. She loves U2 and was looking for a specific title: ""One"" A good buy!"
5,"I pity anyone who'll die without having heard Achtung, Baby.","OK, why not...I'll add my voice to the thousands who proclaim this to be not only U2's best but one of the entire rock genre's finest as well. Is it all that difficult to see why? The music ranges from trippy and rockin' (""Mysterious Ways"", ""The Fly"", ""Zoo Station""...) to quietly sublime (""So Cruel, ""Love is Blindness""...) to soaring pop (""Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses"", ""One""). It's my humble belief that anybody who rates A SINGLE ONE of these tunes as less than classic doesn't know what they're talking about. I've read a couple reviews here that pointed out some ""average"" songs. Exqueeze me?? Turn on the radio...that's what AVERAGE pop-rock music sounds like. Don't believe me? Your loss! :)"
5,A masterpiece!!,"Certainly the best album of the 1990s and one of the greatest albums of all time. Interestingly, unlike The Joshua Tree, none of the 12 tracks on this album would be considered smash hits (I don't think any of the tracks did particularly well on the singles charts). But as a whole, the album is MUCH, MUCH bigger than its elements! It is darker, more complex, more sexual than the previous albums; at times hypnotic, and at times incredibly romantic. At the time of its release, the world of music was in midst of a revolution. Grunge and alternative rock were the order of the day. Achtung Baby was as far from that musical style as The Joshua Tree was from 80s Heavy Metal and Pop. However, like a true classic, the album has outlived the fads of its time and continues to sound fresher than ever. I am sure I will still be listening to it 10 years from today."
5,The Best CD of the 90's,"With due respect to Nirvana (""Nevermind"") and Radiohead (""OK Computer""), this CD is without question the CD of the 90's.Why do I think so? Because U2, one of the world's most popular, successful, and critically acclaimed bands of it's time.....took the chance by making over their image and their music stylistically and created a work that was dark, edgy, dancable, melodic, alternative, and mainstream at the same time. What other CDs from established artists have had credibility in the 'pop' and 'alternative' genres? Not many, this being one of a few.They could have easily copied their success on The Joshua Tree and sell millions, but instead they chose to explore new musical territory (for them) regardless of the consequences. Few bands can and have done that while still maintaining their popularity (The Beatles and Stones come to mind).This is one disc that I still listen to constantly."
5,"The music is reversible but time is not, go back...","I recently purchased this second edition of Achtung Baby as well Emerson, Lake, and Palmers Live from Nassau Colesium. I am enjoying both tremendously. More than I expected. For this U2's rerelease of a masterpiece there are differences that the listener can distinguish. For me it is the acoustic guitar which seems more present in the new edition. As with all great works of art the music and lyrics are more prevalent now than when the tracks were first put to plastic. I mention ELP as well in this review because there most recent CD, like Achtung Baby, is a blast from the past. I am biased by my age and consider most modern music irrelevant and look to the past when trying to find the meaning of humanity in the art form of music."
3,good but not great,"The album is a good one, but has a long way to go to be considered a classic. Some of the songs get old after a few playings such as mysterious ways and the end of the world. Other songs such as the fly and one are outstanding. Unfortunately, not a great deal of work went into making this album and it shows. To consider U2 to be in the class of rock masters such as the Beatles and Led Zepplin is short sighted to say the least. If U2 put more effort into their work and tightened up their playing they would be outstanding. But as this album shows they have not done that yet."
3,Not my favourite,Not my favourite album. I loved One and Until the End of the World. The album was not cohesive. Some of the songs sound like Josua Tree U2 and some others...are different.
2,not nearly as good as the joshua tree,"i'm one of the few people that believe u2 went down the toilet with this record. i loved ""the joshua tree"" and played it all the time, but this record did nothing for me, but mildly interested me with the cut ""mysterious ways"". spring instead for ""joshua tree"" or greatest hits (with my favorite song pride) instead unless you live for techno stuff more than guitars."
4,Their Best,",Achtung Baby is U2's CD that has made me change my attitude towards the band. The rhythms and special effects are extremely creative especially on Zoo Station, Mysterious Ways, and So Cruel.Furthermore, One is truly a beautiful emotional song. Definitely one of U2's all time best songs based on the lyrics, vocals, and effects. Love Is Blindness is another captivating piece. Love the piano accompanyment and the guitar soling at the end is just awesome. Its certainly a team effort on those tracks although The Edge's contributions seem to stand out just a little bit more.The band does over-rely on a similar pattern throughout many of the tracks. However,this is a minor drawback. But overall, this recording certainly has many good merits that even some non-fans can appreciate."
5,The Greatest Work of Music,"U2 is different from others because they express themselves rather than try to find what makes money. Bono once commented that he believes that the songs are already written and his job is to try not to get in their way too much. Achtung Baby, for U2, was the album that revived them (after what seemed like the end of the road after Rattle and Hum) and gave them a new meaning of what life as musicians is all about. Achtung Baby must be listened to from beginning to end without interruptions or skipping through songs, as if one was reading a book. It tells a story of confusion, sex, love, betrayal, and desperation. And I have read this awesome book thousands of times."
5,MAGIC MOMENT FROM U2!!!!,"ACHTUNG BABY is one of the best moments from U2...After the global sucess of JOSHUA TREE and RATTLE AND HUM, U2 change their sound and create another great collection of rock songs...They put some eletronic sounds and all the atmosphere is a little different...but this only improves the U2 sound...BONO was at his peak as a lyricist and frontman, and the band shine with the funky guitars from EDGE....from the sweet melodies of ONE and SO CRUEL, to the cool rocks of THE FLY, EVEN BETTER THAN THE REAL THING, THE ACROBAT and UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD, this is a masterpiece...U2 got some great stuff, ACHTUNG BABY is among the very best from this incredible Irish band!!!!"
4,A Very Nice Collector's 'must have'.,"I've been a somewhat U2 fan since the mid-to-late 80's and found that ""Achtung Baby"" was a worthy and edgy album of the 90's. After reading that this is becoming rare and hard to find, I ran down to Best-Buy and found thier last copy. First off, this is heavy, both in content and weight (no dolly required), but still a substantial box-set none the less. The music is impressive and the extra's are excellent, as are the DVD's. I only wish Pink Floyd would've gone this route instead of the ""Immersion"" fiasco. It is worth the $ and you will not be disappointed."
5,Best U2 album ever,"This is a great album, and like a great wine it comes better with time. Maybe ""Acrobat"" could be the weakest song, but it's just because the others are just amazing."
5,The Best '90`s album by U2!,This album is a real treat. There are alot of good tunes in it. This by far is my favorite U2 album from the 90's.I have nothing more to say other than...This album is Even Better Than the Real Thing! Buy it...if you have not already.
5,___#1__A L B U M __ OF__A L L__T I M E_____MASTERPIECE,"what more can be said...... this album is the type of music I could only dream of, to create something like this is unmistakably genius I love some legendary groups, classic rock modern rock,, but Im confident in saying that this album has the best music on it EVER, yes EVER. Listen to every track, not just the hits. each is BRILLIANT***** 10/10 100% pure emotion , blood and tears on these tracks. If you are reading this and don't have the album yet,,,,,well brace yourself,,,you will be entering a new dimension of music, you will enjoy :) Enjoy"
5,MY PERSONAL FAVORITE,"This was a complete revelation. Nobody expected this from U2, everybody was waiting for the next Joshua Tree, and they manage to stay true to their beliefs, with a new face. This album rocks!!! One of the top ten albums of all time? Why not?"
5,"WOW,,,my god","Life as you know it will change after you plunge deep into Achtung Baby. I listen to all kinds of music, mainstream, undergound, dance, jazz, rock. Achtung Baby deserves 6 stars out of five! Wow, I cant tell you how good this is, Ive been listning to it now for close to 7 years!, Im still playing it NON STOP! U2 has somthing on the music world! I reccomend this CD, more than I can tell you. It is Topps, in a league of its own. every song is magnificent!"
5,"so hard to choose, but...","I was befuddled when I first heard the great Acthung. U2 was always a band to reinvent themselves, but this was a total departure. There was something heavy, something menacing to the sound, like the end of the world. But this is the particular draw of this album- it's gravity. There aren't really any anthems, just really tight and fuzzy guitar hooks and muffled vocals. The sound is still big U2. There's a lot of stuff going on in this album, both universally and personally with the band. They had announced their official break up on tour, but decided to keep it together. Instead of destroying themselves, they destroyed the old U2 and came up with one of the most brilliant albums of all time."
3,U2's Rubicon Album,"This was the album that marked the dividing line for me. I loved The Joshua Tree, Unforgettable Fire, and even Rattle and Hum. Their earlier albums (Boy, October. and War) showed the evolution of their songwriting and playing. Edge is still one my favorite guitarists from the 80's. He was so influential for that time period. Achtung Baby had a few good tunes, but a lot of filler. That statement can be repeated for every album afterwards. Every album after Achtung has maybe one good cut and the rest is tepid."
5,THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE,"Simply put, if I were stranded on a desert island for the rest of my life and could only take one album with me... this is it. That's how good this album is."
3,BE AWARE: The packaging is not the high quality hard slip-case version,"I love U2. The 2nd disc of B-sides and rarities in this Deluxe Edition is worthwhile and probably what you expected. The packaging for this Deluxe Edition however, is definitely not! I expected the higher quality hardcover slipcase package like the other U2 anniversary editions (Boy, War, etc.), instead what you get is the soft-cover packaging like the worthless Deluxe Edition of their last release, No Line on the Horizon. I envisioned having all the U2 albums lined up on my CD shelf in those nice hard slipcover editions. Would have looked awesome! Sorry to say, that doesn't look like it is ever going to happen. I appreciate the previously unreleased material, it's a must have for any U2 fan, but why change the style of the packaging?"
4,Very overated.,"This album is the most ridiculously overated U2 album ever.While it has some of the best songs ever record ""Even Better Than the real thing"" ""Zoo Station"" ""One ""Until the end of the world"" ""The Fly"", the rest are beyond awful.""Trying to throw your arms around the world"" and ""Whos gonna run your wild horse"" are terrible, if you want U2s best album, you'll find that its ""Pop""."
4,Achtung Dake-Bonoists!,If you don't own a Dake Study Bible then you won't understand half the references in the lyrics on this album. Bono's devotion to the Rev. Finis Dake is overt in almost every song. The only problem is that if you haven't read Dake's study bible you won't be able to see it.Those who have ears to hear will hear!
5,LOVE MY BOX SET!,"I ordered the Achtung Baby Deluxe Vinyl Box set for my fiance who is a huge U2 fan. It arrived in time, as described, in excellent condition! I am very happy with my purchase from this vendor."
1,Goodbye U2,This album was the downfall of Irelands finest. They let their quality control and integrity drop with this dodo. And haven't recovered since.
1,No Joshua tree~,This album is very overatted. The Joshua Tree is the best thing this Irish 4-piece ever put out. This is over-produced and annoying.
1,Dreadful!!!,This is rock music at its worst total bosh! Avoid this rubbish and go in serch of classic rock like the Who & Led Zeppelin. U2 are one of those commercial greedy groups that all but killed the genre.
1,BAD,"REALLY A DICK... POOR IN ALL! THE UGLIEST ALBUM OF ALL TIMES, WITHOUT ANY DOUBT. NEVER BUY THIS IN YOUR LIFE!"
4,One of the best U2 albums.,"Not many ""departure"" albums are successful, but this certainly is one. This is U2's first album leading to the rock-techno sound, and there are many great songs on this disc, and not many, if any bad songs. ""Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses"", and ""One"", are deep, emotional ballads, while ""Mysterious Ways"" has a great percussion beat, and a catchy melody. ""Even Better Than The Real Thing"", and ""Until The End Of The World"", are great rockers, and ""Light My Way"", has superb lyrics. I think the best song is probably ""Tryin To Throw Your Arms Around The World"".I didn't give this five stars, because I don't know if this album will stay as one of my favorites, as ""The Joshua Tree"" did, and become a ""classic"", but if it does, I'll be back here, with more to say."
4,"Great album, but I can not say this is the best","Although ""One"", ""Stay"" and couple of other powerful dance-floor-kind tracks jam-packed in this album, I have to say that this is not the best of all U2 albums like many other fans have voted. Of all the albums I've listened to over and over throughout the past few years since I've ever become a die-hard U2 fan, many of my favorite tracks are off from their early albums. ""Wide Awake in America"", ""Rattle and Hum"", ""War"", ""Joshua Tree"". Get ready for their next ""heavy"" Rockin' Album!"
5,"""I'm Ready For What's Next""","U2 entered the 90s with a landmark album that rivals the aggressive ""War"" and the breakthrough ""The Joshua Tree"" as their best one ever. Showing no signs of the band's previous work, this album starts off with the ""dance-rock"" song ""Zoo Station,"" which would foreshadow their direction in the last decade. Their collaborations with Brian Eno are obvious, for a lot of the song s seem to be inspired by his work and his ambience. ""One"" is also one of the best songs in history. That song sends shivers in my spinal column even 10 years later.Bono's vocals reach an emotional zenith on this album, as well as Edge's rather innovative guitar playing, and Larry Mullen's unique approach to drumming. They haven't made an album this good in the last 10 years, though ""AYCLB"" comes somewhat close. Essential to any U2 fan, and a sign that U2 would be dominant in the next decade to come, more dominant than they were in the 1980s."
5,offroad winch,I am well pleased with the product. It was just like the advertisement. I would re order if i need another for friends.
5,FUNNY!,JERRY CLOWER IS SO FUNNY! WE REALLY LIKE THIS CD! WE LISTEN AS WE ARE TRAVELING! YOU DON'T GET TIRED OF LISTENING TO IT!
2,"Not the same as the old stuff, & that's a bad thing...","Question... What were you on to make you produce a ""concept"" cd.Where's the power drums of PJ Parti? Is Dr. Bob even on this? This cd sounds like a desperate attempt to re-kindle the flame of the former lineup. Weak, weak, weak."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this book to study for the K-6 SAE after I recieved the study guide from the University of South Florida. I wanted a book that had all the information I would need to study the many compentencies listed in the USF study guide. I thought this book would do that. To some degree it did, but I found myself looking alot of compentencies up on answers.com because they were not provided in this book. The Social Science section is great! Tons of information there but the science section is very lacking and the lang. arts section left out several key compentencies that are on the test. For the price of the book I would recommend downloading the compentencies and doing your own research. I hope my opinions can be of some help.Also, I read the other reviews and didn't believe that a study guide worth so much money would really be littered with typos, but it is true. I couldn't believe it."
1,Waste of time and money,"I just got through taking the K-6 test three hours ago, and I am extremely disappointed. Not only did I pay too much for this study guide, I wasted valuable time studying and wading through the many errors and typos in this book. The only thing from this book that was actually helpful on the test was the math! I could have gotten a review of that from any old textbook. Save your time and money, just do research online."
1,Not very helpful,"Aside from the design being totally basic (black and white outline format), there were many typos and incorrect word placements. I thought one of the exercises would be to edit and proof the whole manual and sadly, it wasn't. I did not enjoy reading this material and am currently searching for another resource to pass the exam."
2,Its ok,This book is very outdated. The competencies have changed completely. It is ok for a general review.
3,BERTRAND RUSSELL ATTACKS TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE,"Bertrand RussellMarriage and Morals(New York: Horace Liveright, 1929) 320 pages(London: Allen & Unwin, 1976) 203 pagesA ground-breaking book about relationships between the sexes.Takes a rational and unconventional look at the traditions of marriage.Argues for freedom in relationships rather than dead duty.Russell practiced what he preached, changing relationships frequently.If you are interested in more recent books,search the Internet for the following bibliography:""The Best Books Critical of Traditional Marriage""."
5,The right best excellent plane.,"The LEICA model that was based on FZ50 which improved performance from FZ30.I judged the function of FZ50 with the perfect model who cried more than this, but decided to use it habitually.It is portability and one the lens type digital camera which it can photograph immediately. The right best excellent plane."
4,Cool experimental British rock,"After the first listen you'll wonder what you just heard. After the second listen you'll wonder why you haven't heard of Six by Seven sooner. If British rock is known for being melancholy, The Things We Make doesn't disprove this theory. A lot of the songs are gloomy. The good songwriting and feedback driven jams make it fun to listen to though. There is even a very cool ballad on the album, ""Oh!Dear."" There are plenty of reasons why Six by Seven should be proud of the things they make."
3,SHOCKING,"...Is the best word to describe NAMBUL 3.If you know anything about what occurred in the WWII concentration camps, NAMBUL 3 will still surprise you. The plight of the prisoners hits very close to home, and Mr. Lee's statement, while heavy handed at times, is still frighteningly powerful.Hopefully, the graphic depictions of the evil that the human psyche is capable of as depicted in this book will not deter you from reading this work of genius."
3,"Interesting yes, hmm.","This is a smog at the end of the millenium ep. He is older and more grizzled and sings with a Johnny Cash sexy swagger (i.e. with arrogant soul). He knows his songs are brilliant and he doesn't care. This is not the most carefully crafted selection of songs but the new version of ""I was a stranger"" is brilliant. Just to hear him sing it with the mental stability the first version lacked is worth the cost. You should buy this if you are interested in his recent albums and because if enjoy watching rain settle into a puddle on the sidewalk."
4,GREAT 1957 Show,"This show is VERY good! The Welk show's early years were the best. Alice Lon, Rocky Rockwell, The Lennon Sisters, a LARGE orchestra were irreplaceable and sorely missed in later years. The video quality of this DVD is okay, but there are parts where the sound drags, and that's why it only got four stars from me. If five stars is great, the content deserves SIX stars!I hope to see more of these wonderful shows offered in the future. If the commercials were left in, that would also be a big plus!""Top Tunes And New Talent"" was a second weekly Welk show. It was later renamed ""The Plymouth Show"", and they featured talented young guests. This episode's guests included an Irish tenor, a harpist, and a blind girl that played bells and tuned glasses. I enjoyed each and every number. Pete Fountain's ""My Blue Heaven"" was a highlight."
1,Too Old.,"I really thought that these where in color. You see We have a daughter who is 27 years old but mentally she about a 3 year old. But she loves music.Big band, Jazz, you name it. Her optical adjustment to ""poor quality"" black and white is very limited. Both DVD's are really useless for our concerns."
1,Think hard before buying,"Okay, I do not like Power Rangers. I never have and probably never will. My 6 year old son loves Power Rangers, so I deal. I got him this toy and am nothing but disgusted with it. My son opened it and was kind of excited at first, but once we got it out of the packaging he played with it for about 3 minutes and never touched it again. It is very hard to change and pieces kept coming off. Even in a room full of adults, most people had a hard time getting the pieces to reattach and changing the ranger into it's 2 shapes.Now it is sitting in the toy box collecting dust - woohoo go go power rangers."
1,Foie Gras: tasty..... but at what prize?,"It is impossible to ignore the insane cruelty that goes into producing foie gras. Metal pipes are shoved deeply into the throats of ducks and geese, reaching their stomachs. Then a lever is squeezed to pump huge amounts of corn directly into them. This makes the animals become grossly overweight in just a few weeks and their livers will expand to up to 10-12 times their normal size.I think it's absolutely shameless to just pretend all the suffering doesn't exist and that it's irrelevant to reviewing books like this one. Yes, books like these have a right to exist (free press), but so do the opinions of people like me who oppose promoting foie gras.I'm sure the recipes are amazingly tasty to many people,.... but at what prize?We have the internet now, so please google foie gras and inform yourself before making a decision."
3,"An author with a bicycle, just NOT the ride for me.","An interesting tour through the high plateaus of Tibet, on a Bicycle! The author (a martial artist) pedals her way across the pages, much as she does through that region; with agonizing slowness and pure tenacity. Her travels lead her readers the through astounding complexity and spartan beauty found few other places in the world. Yet like the author, the ""journey"" leaves the reader aching for a soft pillow. Ms. Logan warned her reader (finally...) she was NOT writing of her ""martial arts experiences"" and that truly is too bad. Yet the few which she did specifically mention, to some, would be well worth the wait. A valiant effort, captivating at points. In her next work, the author will have hopefully ""honed"" whichever ""experiences"" she profoundly wished to convey. A quality in THIS work, she has not mastered ""sufficently"" well yet !!!!! A great book this is not, but a fair start, none the less."
5,Teaches about the afterlife,"This illustrates the afterlife in a beautifully done movie. It has English subtitles and you can easily understand what is going on in the movie. The healing, the mystery and the understanding of the afterlife is illustrated here. The color and sets are beautiful. It makes one think."
3,"Interesting, but . . .","Astral City starts with death and ends with birth, a strange movie with rather hackneyed ideas about what life must be like after death. Man dies of heart attack, goes to heaven, meets others who are no longer earth-bound and learns the lesson that if you serve others, the service you provide is about the recipient, not ""about you.""Like a beautiful illustration, Astral City is a joy to look at, even with all of its cliches--angels in white tunics and linen pants, for example; or, the filmmaker's vision of heaven--beautifully lit, gorgeously green, marvelously architected, but viewers have to be patient with the dialogue and acting. Both are a bit robotic, and you get the feeling you've seen this before. Sadly, it doesn't leave you with a sense of of deja vu--just that deja vu all-over-again feeling."
2,nice movie but not deep and not worth 5 stars,i watched this movie bc it had a number of high ratings. bit of a disappointment. Had a feeling that those that rated it high were a little religious in their perspective.
3,I expected alot more from this...,Boring....not a Great Book....a book you can misplace and not recall what the plot was....and not look for it again...
5,A magnificent journey!,"I read this book about ten years ago and it was great seeing such perfect adaptation.The life of Chico Xavier (world's most famous medium) is fantastic and it's even more interesting to know about Andre Luis's story, who is Chico's spiritual guide.The film portraits the story of Andre Luis when he passes away, victim of his excesses in drugs and alcohol. Will he eventually find his peace of mind? It's an extraordinary spiritual journey. Worth seeing it!"
5,Well worth watching,I had no idea what this film was about I simply watched in on a whim and I am glad I did.
5,An interesting story,An interesting look on what life is like and a different twist on the directions we take in life and how that affects what comes next.
5,A Very Good Movie,This video goes along for the most part in what I already believe. The only fault I find with it is it was not dubbed in English but it is the first movie I've ever seen where subtitles didn't turn me completely off. It's a very spiritual movie. I watched it first on Amazon Prime. I enjoyed it so much I had to order a copy. Fred
5,"Wonderful, spiritual","I didn't know that this was based on books by a medium. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I speak Portuguese, so listening to the voices was a delight and the subject matter was inspirational. After many years in the Catholic church I considered myself agnostic, but now after seeing this, I don't know. Amazing!"
5,INCREDIBLE!,What a great film! I've never been a fan of subtitles (the film is in Portuguese) but you don't even realize it because the subject matter is so engaging and interesting. I wouldn't recommend this film to those who are not open minded or for those who are religiously set in their views. It's so much more than mere entertainment. There are deep spiritual messages to be explored and considered.
2,Virtually unwatchable,"Perhaps my expectations were to high, or perhaps its it that I do not see things from a purely western perspective. I felt the film was great if you adhere to the western version of heaven and hell, redemption and being ""saved"". It appears to me that those who feel they are ""saved"" want to ""see"" what the ever after might be like for them. This film appears to give you a glimpse of what it MIGHT be like. Therefore, for those already in that mind set this might be a good film. It definitely was not my cup of tea."
1,You asked for it,"So here you all are, moaning and complaining over Jordan's last work. ""It's boring,"" you say. ""It doesn't advance the plot."" Of course it doesn't and that's the point. If the last 1500 pages of mind-numbing filler haven't kept you from buying this book, I've got some swamp land you might be interested in. Who are you people that keep shelling out for this stuff? Ever hear of a library?"
2,Not so good,"This is probably the worst book in the series. There is not much going on. The plot did not advance at all from the previous book and to think I waited two years for this book. The only important part is the prologue which is like the continuation of the Book 9, _Winter's Heart_. Do not buy this book. Just borrow it from a library if you really want to know what happens. At least you can return it without delay"
3,Hmm...,"Giant clashes are on the horizon. The Last Battle is coming and all of humanity hangs in the balance. The only problem is...IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET.I'm not going to expand on that last bit, because chances are you've already heard about it, but let me suggest something to all the fans who, like me, want the huge conflict to come:Maybe Jordan has no idea what he's going to do.It's a mammoth task, ya gotta admit. He's set up so many different plot lines, and hinted at such a huge climax, that if it were me...I'd be scared.So be patient, WOT fans. I'm sure he'll resolve this huge series.When he figures out what the heck he's going to do. :)"
2,Boring.,What happened with this book? From the 1st book till the 9th it was really good but here there's rarely any action at all. I was expecting better from this series.
2,Just when you thought you turned a corner...,"I like this series, perhaps more properly phrased I liked the first half of this series. Then I became frustrated at the padded, glacial, bloated books that have made up the second half. Then I read Path of Daggers, lots of interesting things happened and it looked like the plot was warming up.Then came Crossroads of Twilight...after reading it I can say nearly half to two thirds of the book could have been simply left on the cutting room floor and nobody would be the wiser. Jordan has proven he is a detailed writer at the cost of having an engaging series. More word count is spent on characters that the reader will never see again, much less care about care about.This series is becoming like a siege, I have invested the time reading The Wheel of Time and know I will tough it out. How much worse could it get? Only if there are 10 more books after this one."
5,awesomesauce,"another awesome episode, cant wait for the next one! F the haters, read this book, it is so worth it"
1,More Wheel of Time... Who Cares??,"Robert Jordan has suceeded in losing a fan. A series that started out with a bang is continuing with a huge yawn. Jordan has apparently decided that character development is more necessary than plot, and that confusing, intricate detail is more necessary than any semblance of action. One wonders if his main goal is writing the longest novel in the history of mankind, rather than bringing any kind of closure to what started as an immensely interesting series of books. His ""Wheel of Time"" needs to have the axle greased, that flat fixed, and put into motion towards a conclusion."
1,worst book of the series,"Nothing happens. People move here, they go there - all with no effect or advancement of the main story. No motivations of any significance are revealed. No battles are fought. No fights. No saidar or saidin used except trivial, every day usage.The whole book could have been 4 slim chapters (Rand, Perrin, Mat, White tower/Egwene) in a book where something does happen.The whole book leads up to (SPOILER HERE - look away) a possible truce with the Seanchan and Egwene getting captured through her own stupidity.Wow! What action! <-- sarcasm, if you haven't caught on.I hope Robert Jordan is reading these reviews, because he has a lot to make up for with this book."
2,Weakest in the series,"It's hard to give a 2/5 to a book in a series I'm very fond off, yet it's hard to find any redeeming points for Crossroads. The story stops. It literally grinds to an almost full stop. Devoting a part of the book to going over the effects of Rand's actions at the end of the previous books could have been agreeable. We after all all remember where we were 9/11 or whatever. Thus, a couple of hundred pages devoted to portraying how Rand's actions reflect on other characters and what they were doing at the time sounds like a good idea.It doesn't work, however, when you devote 800 pages and nothing, nothing at all, happens.Why the 2/5 then? Well, the writing style is the same as all previous books and chances are if you liked those, you'll at least find some redeeming points.Reading this book, I had the continuous feeling that had Mr Jordan not passed away, the series would never in a million years have concluded with book 14, the pacing was simply not there."
1,Crossroads of Twilight,"SLOW!.... Slow!.... Slooooooow! Absolutely no action in this installment. Dialogue, Dialogue, Dialogue. A complete and total waste of time. If you are trying to get to the final battle and haven't made it to book 10, just skip it! There is nothing in this book that is at all relevent to the story line... and you will save yourself time, frustration and you will probably get to find out about the final battle (unlike myself who just decided that if the author decided to put me thru this agony, I certainly wasn't going to submit myself to any more of it). Let me know how it turns out. If you're listening Amazon, I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
4,Wheel of Time,I'm reading Robert Jordan's Wheel Of Time Series from beginning to end.Characters are well written and enjoyable.Action scenes feel like you are there.I'm going to be sorry when the series finally ends.
5,I love Robert Jordan and the sellers product was as advertised.,I posted the same review for all of the R.J. books I bought on Amazon because I feel the same about each purchase. R.J.'s style started to slide on this book but the story line held up. I started this series by buying the first at a resale shop and was addicted by page five. It was heart breaking to lose Robert Jordan before the series ended but I loved it so much I waited for the second to final book and am about to buy the last which I hope holds up to the quality of writing he did. I did notice a change in the book 11 before he passed. It was like his style was dulled but I followed through and was glad I did. Will buy from this seller again.
2,Sam Old Same Old,"I enjoyed the first four books of this series, which impelled me to buy the entire series. But starting with Book V, the series became tedious. For subsequent books I simply searched for a few character names (easy to do with my Kindle) to find out what happened."
1,Nothing happens,"I liked most of the Wheel of Time books. I thought after the events of book 9, things would start to wrap up, but my worst fears turned out to be optimistic. Absolutley nothing happens. Except in the last 3 paragraphs of the book. Go to the library or book store and read the last chapter and you will keep current with the story."
1,Nothing but filler...,"I finally got around to reading this book. I've enjoyed this series of books very much since I stumbled upon them. I can honestly say that this is the first book of the series that is complete and utter garbage, filler.The story moves nowhere. I can't even say nowhere fast because Jordan's flair for detail bogs you down and makes the reading slow.Hopefully in the next book Jordan will remember that the story is about the Dragon reborn and his two friends. I hope that Jordan spares us all the agony of another 700 page book describing what color underwear all the Aes Sedai are wearing on any given day."
1,"Filler, pure 100% filler","If you're looking for a book with magic, action and adventure then keep looking. If you're interested in a book where women spend a lot of time either smoothing or twitching their skirts, being either red faced or stone faced then this is the book for you. Jordan peaked at book 3 and frankly anything after book 5 is not worth reading. If you're a Jordan fan then save your money and get it out of the library. If you're not a Jordan fan then don't bother reading this book because nothing happens. You can go from book 9 to book 11 without missing a thing. The only reason this book was 680 pages long instead of 60 was so Bob could bank another cheque instead of actually writing a true fantasy novel. This is not good fantasy don't let anyone convince you otherwise. Read Guy Gavriel Kay's ""Fionavar Tapestry"" trilogy instead."
3,Disappointing,"This is number ten in a long series and probably the most disappointing. It seems to mark time and leave strange gaps where a fuller description is needed. The hero hardly gets a mention. Still, I brought and read it and will probably buy the next one as well.I would prefer if I knew how many there would be though."
1,"BORING, Nothing happened","This was not just boring, but nothing even happened. I went on a road trip and listened to the audio. I kept waiting for something pertinent to happen and 30 hours later all I could do was shake my head and wonder what a bunch of garbage......."
2,Crossroads of Twilight,Very dissappointed in this book. It did not go anywere. I thought the one before this one did not go anywere but I was wrong. The first half of this book takes place before the end of the last book. Then the last few chapters just updates a few chars. I think we progressed two weeks past the cleaning of the male half of the source. Very Disappointing... :(
3,You are going to buy it anyways....,"I am a huge WOT fan and I think Robert Jordan is an great writer. This book has long been anticipated by his fans. I was disappointed with the book. Not to give any of it away, but it did not advance the plot too much."
2,Incredibly disappointing,"Once again Robert Jordan disappoints with ""Crossroads of Twilight"". I have been an avid Jordan reader since the beginning and its clear that the quality of his books has gone downhill. If I hadn't read the prior nine books, I would surely not start reading Jordan now.There is very little plot advancement in the Crossroads of Twilight. Rand doesnt even appear until the very end and you only get a glance at Nynaeve. I can't believe it took him nearly three years to write this book! One bright spot is that Crossroads of Twilight is not as bad as Path of Daggers. Wait for the paperback or check it out from the library, its just not worth it."
2,Left without satisfaction.,"I found myself very disappointed with book 10 when I finished. Jordan's wordiness usually entices me, but left me hanging this time. Jordan put massive amounts of description into what women were wearing, or their facial expressions, etc. and came out with a very wordy book with really nothing to say. There was really no forward movement in the storylines making it seem like this book is simply a means to make money and continue to stumble this series forward to no end. His portrayal of women leaves much to be desired with a constant view of females being catty, sly and full of ulterior motives. Even the end (where all the books usually pick up) was a yawner. I feel I wasted time in this text and am not going to recommend the series to anyone else until Jordan shows as much passion for the story as in the past. I think it's gone on even too long for him."
1,In Desperate Need of Oil,"Coming from Goodkind's last bad book, ""Naked Empire,"" the first three hundred pages of ""Twilight"" read fairly well, but suddenly everything slowed. Much of the novel is a reaction to the previous novel and Rand barely appears. This is a cross road indeed, with little direction or choices made by anyone. So much of the novel seems like a diversion, with new minor chracters that seem very unrelated to the saga's plots. By the end of the novel so few things happen, they could be summed up in a short pargraph, which is disappointing in a novel of this length. I may or may not continue reading this series, but this is the last book in the series I will pay for. The page turning days in this series are long gone."
2,Jordan is lost in the wheel of words,"This has got to be the worst book yet in this series. I am sure that Mr. Jordan is just putting words on paper to sell another book. He has lost all support from his readers. Each successive book is worse than the others. They are dragging the reader along. Mr Jordan must love to make up female names and describe them in boring details. That is how he gets 800 pages of nothing. There is no action in this book. There is very little continuation of the story. Give it up Mr. Jordan and finish the story. Any future readers should skip this book entirely. Unless Mr. Jordan plans to finish the story in the next book, I would recommend skipping the next books also."
1,A book with a loss of purpose.,"I read the book when it first came out, even though I agree that the first few books were excellent and the latest have just been average.This one was terrible. The book starts developing an interesting sub-plot with Perrin chasing after an abducted Faile, and just when it gets suspensful and interesting we switch to another more confusing and less intriguing sub-plot.Never fear, right? We'll sooner or (much) later get back to the Perrin/Faile crisis, wouldn't you think? WRONG!!!! The book finishes the second and third sub-plot and forgets it even started the first one!Maybe this is no reflection on Jordan's writing abilities. Maybe the publishers insisted on deadlines or something and that this was a team effort in the making. We can only hope.I'd like to see Jordan return to form and head towards a conclusion. He could probably get it done in two books or less as long as he decides to do it.Until then, I'll stick with Terry Goodkind's novels . . ."
1,An industry problem,"This is not a review of the book so much as a review of the state of fantasy & sci-fi literature. We have a problem here my friends...a problem perpetuated by us, the fans. We are continually fed endless series by nearly every popular author for the sake of the allmighty dollar. The only person getting fulfilled by reading these bloated works are the author and the publisher. We, the fans, are forced to wade through up to 10,000 pages for a story that could (conceivably) be accomplished in a tight 600 page novel. Ask yourself: When was the last time you read a standalone fantasy novel?Yes I own the books, but Robert Jordan (and Tor) is one of the leading offenders in this area. Make a stand and stop buying fantasy & sci-fi series that end up turning into mindless drivel after a few books. These people (and companies) are publishing books merely for the sake of publishing and making money...not to tell us a story."
1,"In the end, nothing","Painful to read. Nothing happens. No end in sight to this series, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Travel away from this series!,"WOT started out as an exciting fantasy series with interesting concepts and characters. It has been reduced to a muddled soap opera that progresses so slowly it cannot be called WOT but should be called Week in Review. Do not bother to read any more of this series. Pick a great fantasy trilogy, of which there are now many, and leave Jordan to fleece the brainwashed WOT fans, if there are any left out there (poor creatures!)"
1,Piece of garbage,"Don't waste your time or money. The plot has yet to move significantly since book 4. The 1,000,001 character was introduced at the beginning of the book, only to have the character ignored for the rest of the book. It seems the only way to get him to finish the story is if people stop buying. So long as people keep buying, he will have no incentive to advance the plot. I wish I had my money back."
1,700 pages of brain fart,"Really, how could he have possibly released this?? How can he have so little respect for his fans to sell this mess? Nothing happened to any of the characters that couldn't of been told in a page or two. He literally stretch out 20 pages of material to SEVEN HUNDRED PAGES!!! The sheer inhumanity is staggering. Now I have to go apologize to all my friends who I'd hooked on this series.... Please, everyone- Pretend it stops at book 8."
1,many wasted hours i'll never get back,"This series could have been great. It's worthless drivel at this point. The reasons have been given a thousand times already, so I won't repeat them. Don't buy it. Go check our George R.R. Martin's 'Song of Ice and Fire' series instead for a real fantasy saga."
3,Could be a whole lote better....,"I could have asked for a lot more.... errr... less pages, but more action. As many other reviews have said, this book is a waste. I hope Mr. Jordan does his series justice as it comes to a close. Thus far the first half of the series has been 10 times better than the second half is turning out to be."
3,Padding to the Main Plot,"Jordan's WoT used to be my favrite series - until I discovered George R.R. Martin's Fire & Ice series. Anyways - the WoT has dragged on for at least the last 3 books. I was expecting this to be the last book and that the conclusion and great build up was going to make this the book that brought the series back on track. I like these side plots, but I also like to spend my money wisely. If you're a die hard fantasy fan like me and enjoy Jordan's WoT, this book will be in your collection, but it wo'nt be remembered.It is enjoyable only in that we get to be with these great charectors again."
1,I'm very glad that...,"I borrowed this one from the library. As most of the other reviewers have said this book does nothing to advance the plot. There have now been three ""set-up"" books with no advancement (plot, character, ect). But you do get a lot of drivel about the thread count of the pillows that a weaver in a small fishing town (that a major character has never been to or heard of) makes. Ohh, tell us more you great sage. Didn't something major happen in an earlier book that was incredibly important (hint: the taint) and you hear almost nothing about it! With all the genius that the major players are supposed to have, they act like spoiled brats with a power complex. At this point I'd like to see the Dark Lord and the Foresaken take over the world and reduce the world to ash so we're not exposed chapter after chapter of who said what to whom and what clothes someone is or is not sweating in or smoothing.Skip this one or borrow it from the library."
1,What a Waste!,"What is Jordan thinking. He is taking longer and longer to write less and less. I've been a huge fan since book one, but this book was terrible. When the series is supposedly wrapping up soon, Jordan keeps adding new characters. It's ridiculous, I feel like I need to take notes to keep track of everyone.If you like the first few books in this series, read George RR Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" insted."
1,"I'm... well, I'm downright dissapointed!!","Don't get me wrong.I have become one of the many loyal readers enthralled with the Epic Adventure that places you right in the midst of the fantasy lives & events throughout the series. I've journeyed with thousands of others through every smile, every laugh & giggle, and even sometimes through a tear or two. But I almost couldn't wait until the end of the book, and I also skipped a few pages where the text just seemed to drag-on (no pun intended).To my astonishment there was not even a single battle that I was aware of, and I am VERY sad to say that CoT could EASILY have been left out altogether and not even missed!!!R.J. I hope the next book redeems you."
2,CoT Goes nowhere,"I don't know what happened to the Wheel of Time series, but the last few books have been largely a waste of time. I agree with a lot of the other viewers who state you can skip this book and just read a summary. I am terribly disappointed that Robert Jordan has managed to completely derail the excellent story he started his series telling."
1,"A 700 page Set-Up Book, Again?","Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series is my personal favorite series. I have read the entire series 4 times. Well it was until this book. Does he ever plan on ending it? The first 400 pages are about what was happening in the world at the end of th last book. At least he finally got back to Mat, but too little to late. To make a long story short, this book was by far the worst one in the series. Don't buy it in Hard Cover."
1,Major Disappointment. Many will stop reading WOT,"I do not recommend this book at all. You are better off reading chapter summaries. This book goes no where. It is one big prologue. Book 9 left off with some real good subplots that should have been drawn out in this book, but nothing happened. Nothing was answered. Only more questions came up. This is a fantasy series and this book was nothing in the realm of fantasy. Save your money. Robert Jordon has lost his tough. Im sticking to free chapter summaries for the rest of this epic. I want to find out what happens to Rand and crew but not at RJ's drawn out money hungry drab. Tor and RJ should be ashamed."
2,Definitely My Least Favorite,"I've stuck with RJ through thick and thin. Like most people, I was a little frustrated with the slow plot movement of the last few books, but I also stood up for RJ, claiming the he was simply trying to make a more realistic world. And, well, isn't real life boring sometimes? But I must say that I was quite disappointed with this title. As other reviewers have said, virtually NOTHING of importance happens in this book. Some decisions are made, but the repercussions are not seen. The major events of ""Winter's Heart"" don't even play a minor role in this novel... in fact, most of the characters don't even know what happened yet! I really had my hopes up for this book after the climax of ""Winter's Heart,"" but they weren't realized. Of course I will continue to read the series, and I look forward to the next book in the hopes that it will be more along the lines of the first 5 or 6 books. I just hope it won't be TOO long of a wait this time!"
2,As The Wheel Turns ...,"I have been a fan of The Wheel of Time series for quite a while. Unfortunately, the quality of the books has declined quite a bit since Lord of Chaos. Robert Jordan's detailed descriptions, which originally were interesting and helped move the plot forward in the early books, have degenerated into long-winded and quite predictable blatherings that do little to advance the plot of the books.I would like to suggest the RJ change the title of the series from The Wheel of Time to ""As The Wheel Turns"". Certainly Mr. Jordan has discovered the daytime soap writer's gift for dragging out the smallest event into entire chapters.-Jim"
1,robert jordan was replaced by a random chapter generator.,"out of all 10 books, the last 4 in the series are markedly slower-paced than the first 6. out of the last 4 books in the series, crossroads of twilight was the most boring waste of time. i used to love this series - up until book 7, each book i considered brilliantly engaging and i devoured them many times over. books 7, 8 and 9 were, by contrast, slow and dull, and tedious to wade through. book 10 outdulled all three in its inanity - robert jordan goes on at length about trivial details (do we really need to know how elayne likes her tea 10 times?) and advances the plotline of the series by only a hair.i thought the series had hope and gamely trudged through 3 mediocre books to find it. now after the 4th, i am quitting. i am sorry, robert jordan, but i'm afraid your writing is nowhere near as enthralling as it once was.in short, i wasted my time with this book."
1,milking the cash cow,"If you were a ... like the rest of us and preordered this book you have my sympathies.One major event happened in this book, the cleansing of saidin, and it wasn't even discussed. Instead we were ""treated"" to 700 pages of bit part characters it would take a spreadsheet to keep track of.Hopefully I'll have the self control not to buy book 11. I'd donate this book to the library except it would be a disservice to the reading public. One star is too generous."
1,plod... plod... plod...,"Like a gambler hoping for another jackpot, I keep coming back to this series looking for something like the earlier installments. They actually had action, interesting plot developments, and characters you could love or hate. Now we're burdened with too many characters, too many plotlines and sub-plotlines that it's almost impossible to keep characters straight without some sort of glossary/listing. It feels too much like Jordan's drawing this out too much, padding the series to make more books. If you're invested in the series already, wait for the paperback and save your money."
1,Jordan repeats himself,"If I hear the phrase ""icy blue stare"" to describe an Aes Sedai one more time, I'm burning all of his books. This has the potential to be one of the best fantasy series of all time and Mr. Jordan is wasting his time on basking in the minutae of his world. Yes, we know there is intrigue. We know you can't trust anyone. We know everything balances on the edge of a knife. Why doesn't he just get on with it and do something already!?And has anyone noticed that almost every character in these books has begun to have the same outlook on things except for Mat? Please, I beg you, make some progress in the next book or you have lost a loyal reader."
1,Worst book of the series,"I am a big fan of the WOT series. In fact I am re-reading this series from the beginning. This book must be the worst of the lot. I am tired of same old drivel repeated over and over. We all read a thousand times how imperious Aes Sedai are, how tough the wind finders and wind mistresses are, not to speak of the wise ones. It is ridiculous filler to keep reminding the reader of the same cr...p. We are not stupid.This book also has a thousand useless characters, from maids, to soldiers to Aes Sedai and on and on and on. They don't do anything, everyone is afraid of everyone else then they disappear never to make any diffrence to the story other than pages and pages of useless descriptions. I am a very patient person and I enjoy good prose and detail. This book is just detail about detail sake. 200 pages would be enough to make this book interesting. The rest of it is waste. TOR should be tarred for publishing this junk."
4,"Richly detailed, but slow-advancing plotlines","I was almost driven crazy waiting for this book to come out. I feel the book is as richly detailed as previous books and the author has seemed to pick up the pace a bit (he has done that for book 9 & 10). Although I was as disappointed as the others that the story did not advance as far as I hoped, I do think the author seems to be slowly bringing in his multiple subplots and building up his momentum. In my estimation, I think the author should be able to bring everything to the conclusion within 2 or 3 more books, i.e. if he does hurry up a bit. If he gets sidetracked again, all bets are off. I have great hope for the 11th book. By the way, I was not as fed up in my waiting as the others possibly because I started this serie when he has written 7 books already. To me, it's only been a long 5 years."
2,"I agree with all, but I'm in it for the long run.","What everyone has said is true. This series has been on the decline. Jordan started out great, one of the greatest fantasy writers I had read. But gradually, the story got drawn out. Until finally, book 10, the hardest book in this series to read. And while I feel I can finish this series in one short book, I will not hold it against Jordan. He has managed to do what most can't, he has created a whole other world, and filled it with creatures and characters we only see in our imaginations. He created a story that is the work of what I feel is a genius. But unless he's got something up his sleeve, it's time to end it. Either way, I'm in this till the end. I'm so into this story that I have to finish it. I can't just let it drop off, I have to know who wins. That is the work of a great story, even if it is drawn out."
3,It isn't all that bad,"While I agree this is hardly Jordan's best in the series, We all have to remember he is human and prone to failure from time to time. I found myself skimming over some parts, but in general I like his style of writing and look forward to a, hopefully, better followup novel."
3,"Better than the last, but still not good enough","Crossroads of Twilight was another major disappointment compared to Jordan's earlier works. However, i think that it was much better than Winter's Heart, which contained no action up until the last hundred pages. Each of the subplots progresses, although still nothing gets resolved. The Forsaken and the Dark One seem all but gone in this book, and there is no major action whatsoever."
4,Nothing yet still something,"When the book first came out, I was ready to dislike it pretty much on principle...But I waited an extra year before reading it to let some of those bad feelings pass and you know what? It is pretty good, I mean maybe not the best of the series and I agree the pace has pretty much slowed to a crawl ( but what can you expect when there are atleast 7+ distinct storylines going at once ), that kind of number means only a hundred or so pages have been devoted to each one. I myself would feel ripped of if one or three of them was ignored or dropped. So all things considered, still a good read."
2,not so bad as some say,"i enjoyed this book as well as all the others in the series, this is just less action packed. either way, you should read all the books through to really get into them."
4,A Nagging Wife,"most of the reviewers on this page have been at it since issue number 5. it's an entertainment, guys, not intellectual piece, nor a college text book that you absolutely must readd. if you don't like it just drop it. don't buy the book anymore and quit qhinning.as for the rest of Jordan fans, like myself, well ... READ ON !"
