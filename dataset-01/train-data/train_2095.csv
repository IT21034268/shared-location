2,Looks good but that's about it,"I agree with ""The Grill Man"" on this one. The tools look really great but are WAY too flimsy. I bought this for my husband and we thougth ""wow, these look great."" I then compared them to the ""cheap"" tools that we bought elsewhere and there was no comparison. These will easily bend if used as they are intended. It's really too bad because the case is great. If you are in the market for new tools, keep looking."
4,Great gift for Dad!,"I purchased this set in June 2004 as a Father's day gift and had it shipped directly to my Dad, so I didn't even get to see it until months later when I went home for a visit. He loved the tools and was very impressed with the flashy silver case (said he felt like 007 every time he snapped open the latches to retrieve a utensil.) My Dad is hard to buy for because he seems to ""have everything"" but he grills a lot, even through the winter, and is still using this set so I guess it was a great buy."
3,Recapitulation of old Thompson ideas,"I read The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light and fell in love with it. As soon as I put it down, I went off in search of more of Thompson's material. Unfortunately, the next book I picked up was Coming into Being -- a nearly identical, if slightly more incoherent and self-important rendering of the same material, with only a few tidbits added. I might have loved it if I hadn't read TTFBTTL first, but the other book is by far the superior text."
4,Nice Quality,Nice drawer slides much better quality than i expected for the price. I am very happy with them.
4,Good price on sturdy slides,"I installed six of these on a workbench that I'm building. The quality is great. No complaints.My only issue was lack of instructions. I'm not an expert on cabinet making, and it wasn't immediately obvious to me how to size the drawer to the cabinet in order to work with the slides. I left too much space and they wouldn't work correctly. As a result I spent quite a bit of time messing with spacers between the slides and the cabinet. Surely, that's my fault, but still, even a small note would be helpful to newbies."
5,Love my Boyds Resin Tracker,"I just love my Boyds Resin Tracker, but sorry they are not making anymore. I find it so helpful to keep track of the Boyds that I have, as I have about 200 resin boyds. Trying to get one of these books for a dear friend that I got onto collecting Boyds resin."
3,Boyds Guide - Missed Some Items,I thought the guide was pretty good but had missed some items. The pictures were not real clear or true color to the real item.
4,Restored dresser for $40 instead of buying a new one for $100s - Happy wife!,Old dresser now works like a new dresser and better quality than originally! Love it. Don't have to spend $100s now on a new dresser. These rails are more sturdy and smoother than the originals!!! No instructions but if you are handy it's not rocket science. Very pleased!
3,"Good book, but needs some basic improvements","I used this book as my main ""get-around"" guide during my vacations in Argentina. The book has an excellent section on travel tips which I found very useful, specially the ""Smart Travel Tips"" section.But some of the maps of Buenos Aires in the book have the locations wrong. I would say most of the maps need revision; I always found a mistake. My advice is to have a back up, maybe a good tourist map which you can find almost anywhere for free on hotels or tourist centers.Also, the phone listed in some of the attractions are wrong. For example, I wanted to arrange a reservation for one of the tango shows listed on the book (by the way, do not miss them for anything in the world!!!), but the phone numbers were wrong also.The book overall is good, plus they have sections on other parts of Argentina, which makes the book very practical if you plan to travel the country, but again the best advise is to have a backup guide (and map), specially for Buenos Aires."
5,a great resource for advanced Spanish learners,"This book contains short stories, poems, and excerpts from a variety of well-known latin american authors such as Octavio Paz, Isabel Allende, Carlos Fuentes, and Pablo Neruda. Each selection includes an introduction of the author, pre-reading notes, footnotes of difficult words with English translation, and post-reading questions."
5,Are you married or happy?,"3 Stooge classics.The title episode AN ACHE IN EVERY STAKE has their most hilarious and memorable gags.CALLING ALL CURS they are veterinarians who have to rescue a kidnapped dog.The stooges ar great as usual, but the dogs steal the show.In POP GOES THE EASEL they join an art school.The aly fight is terrefic. Defininately worth buying."
3,"Price GOOD, Sturdyness GOOD, Condition came in BAD",side of one lamp came cracked on trim. one of the light bulbs did not work. this is the first one. now the second miss aligned screw causes the flap for bulb replacement to come off. had to adjust screw for it to stay works now.29.99 for 2 500Watt light with stand they are great for the PriceI cant really say that the company sent it this way but the way they packed it was not good at all. me personally i believe UPS is partly to blame because of the way they handle there packages
2,Lame quality,"You get what you pay for I guess. This thing is ripping after a few weeks. I ordered one from Klein because the Grizzly is on its last legs. Spend some money get one that wil last.I did like the layout though, ""what do you want for nothing?"""
1,Waste of Money,"The shipping was almost as much as the item. Very cheap 2 piece plastic, with flaws in the plastic. Difficult to fit on and the back button DOES NOT WORK. Do not waste your money on this!!! After 1 hour of trying to make my MP3 work with it on, this case is going in the trash."
2,didnt like this,"I purchased this item thinking it would look fantastic but, was disapointed when i saw that the pendant was very small and that it did not have the engraving design on both sides i wish i had never bought this pendant but, too late i am stuck with it."
2,Ernie Kovaks Would Have Hated This!,"I loved Ernie Kovaks! I looked forward to this compilation. I was severely disappointed. The production is barely above amateur status. It is redundant and repetitive, shows same scenes over and over (Even has the Jack Lemmon commentaries about Ernie repeated more than once). If you liked Ernie, find another source. If you have not seen him before, don't buy this or you will never seek another peek. It borders on awful."
1,Minority opinion,"I was a big Ernie Kovacs fan, and looked forward to seeing these tapes. I and the times have changed, of course, and we have seen a lot of comedy since the 1950s, so that probably explains why I was disappointed. I kept thinking, watching these, how unfunny a lot of what he did, was. With a few exceptions, it's pretty weak stuff, humor-wise. But in the 1950s, I guess it was all new and fresh, and was funny then, compared to other stuff on TV. It is interesting to see how things were done on TV in the early days, and I'm donating my set of this to a film and TV library. Compared to comedy today, this is pretty weak stuff, but I'm repeating myself."
5,Visually Stimulating,"From the very first page, the imagery painted in words is more tantalizing than most in it's class. This story rises off the page and dances through you mind. I highly recommend it to fantasy fans of all ages. Try it out for yourself."
3,Handy Juicer,"The juicer and the book included is great. But honestly I followed the directionsto the letter and barely produced any wheatgrass. So I don't know if the seeds wereold or if it was my error. But the juicer is durable, long lasting and doesn't rust."
5,great kit to get started,Great kit to get started. Everything you need. The juicer works great and is easy to use and clean. Highly recommend this package
4,Always a champion for God,"Any music that Roby Duke decides to put out there for the airwaves is doing the world a grand justice. This singer/songwriter/musician is the best there is. I only wish that I could find his 1984 release ""Come Let Us Reason"". If anyone out there has an idea where this Tape/CD/Album or whatever media source can be found; please place the info on Amazon so that others can experience God's chosen artist at his best."
3,Resourceful and Informative,"I found this book resourceful and informative in alot of issues. I picked up on some new ideas as well. For the most part it is a good book that taps into the reality of our society. I liked some of the monkey wrenching techniques, however would have to honestly say that some of 101 things to do in this book are not of much significance to ME. But as Claire says keep an open mind and that's what I always try to do. So some of the teqniuqes that weren't as helpful to me may be for you. Therefore if you are a person who recognizes the real crooks in this country, and could use some great ideas, information and techniques then I recommend this book. Mike (Chicago)"
5,Amazing Short Stories,"15 shorts in 90 minutes and oh what a joy. Broken down into categories: Films, Animation, Student Films, Interviews, and Editorials. Video and music editing was above my expectations. Mr Bill fans will love the 4th short entitled ""The Animator"". Interestingly there are shorts in this collection from around the world including a silent short and music only short entitled ""Midnight Dance"" a bit macabre but only PG rated(my opinion). All in all a lot of fun and a great way to show your kids what's possible if they're interested in being the future of cinema."
1,Pretty much worthless.,"We bought a pair of these for use in our office, to run the fax of a multifunction device which was 40-50 feet from the nearest phone jack. After setup failed at that range, I did some ad hoc testing with the sync buttons at progressively closer outlets. Operational range appears to be about 15-20 feet (diagonally across a small mailroom) with line-of-sight, and less than 10 feet through one layer of frame-and-drywall. Unless you're desperate to cross a single room, you're better off investing in a line and some cable keepers."
1,Extension Unit Does Not Work With Current InstaJack on the Market,"I purchased the TL26596 (GE Instajack) extension unit to add to the base unit / extension unit (#86597) I had purchased.I could not get the TL26596 to connect with the base unit. I called the phone number provided in the box, that company (Audiovox) no longer supports the extension unit.I consequently called Jasco Products supporting the current GE Instajack only to find out even though the instructions say you can add an extension unit, you cannot. The TL26596 isn't in Jasco's product line."
3,OK but you get what you pay for,Purchased these about 2 years ago. Already have some much higher quality carving tools and bought these tools thinking it would give me some addtional carving shapes to add to my collection. If you plan on doing some crude or large scale carving these are OK and they seem to hold a edge fairly well once sharpened. My biggest issue is the steel on these tools is excessively thick which makes it almost impossible to carve any fine detail. The tools are basically clunkers as fine carving tools. They are unsuitable for any fine carving projects or for smaller figurines or detail you may want to carve. If that is your planned use for them you will be disappointed and frustrated. And if you've never done any carving before these tools will give you the wrong impression of how difficult or fun carving can be.
3,"Good set, but.....",The angles are entirely too steep on these chisels. I used a grinder with a flap disc to remove the steepness and they seem to work better. Don't forget to quinch in water often if doing this. A little wet/dry sandpaper of different grits and they're right.
2,Looks like muslin,"These sheets are thin - you can see open space between the threads of the weave and you can see the pattern on the mattress through the fitted sheet. Not what I consider flannel, more like muslin. If I had seen it in a store I would not have bought it but not so bad that I will return it - though a more diligent shopper might."
4,A fresh - complicated breath of intensity!,"A friend told me of this book and though I had doubts of spending that much money on a new author--I am glad I did. The book starts off with many characters which took a while to get to know, but the prose is poetic and picturesque and K.D. Knudsen does not shy away from depiction of the brutality of evil. The interracial love interest was very sensual and I could see some of the conflict in a relationship I had. The farther I got into the book, the harder it was to put down. The best part...I usually guess the endings...but I never could have in this book. I was stunned and WOWWED! I can't wait for his next work!"
4,"Warped, Sexy, & Thrilling!!!","This story buffeted me like a storm between thrills and pathos! Very erotic in parts and other parts were brutally violent. Definitely not a story for children! Almost was too much for me. But I kept turning the pages with a frenzy. There was such a diversity of characters and the ongoing plot twisted this way and that, it never-the-less rang with reality! I can only say I hope this is just a story!!!"
5,"Student Textbook, NIV Bible","The NIV Bible by Zondervan is wonderful...the Timeline in the beginning of the Bible puts the Old Testament stories into proper order and perspective.Also, the MAPS in the back are very clear and helpful as one studies the history of Israel in the O.T.We are using these bibles with senior citizens and the Timeline and maps areso valuable. Thanks."
2,Poor binding. Falling Apart.,"I've had my copy four or five years. It has served me well. Lately, pages are falling out in sections. A book destined to be read and re-read and studied should have been bound better than this."
1,Please save your money - beware.,"At first it worked great, then in just 4 months I lost everything. Apparently PNY offers a 1 year warranty - however, after being on hold in their automated queue for 20 minutes they hung up on me - I never got to a live person. There's got to be a better product out there. Good Luck."
2,EDGE is MUCH Better!,"I had a PNY Flash Drive - and it crapped out. Now I have an EDGE DiskGo flash drive - and it is awesome. I have had it for years with no problems - and it is ""Secure"" - so you need a password to access the data on it. And it has a lifetime warranty. The way it is housed protects it without there being a cap to lose.4GB Diskgo USB 2.0 Flash Drive.Good Luck all!"
4,great game just a few flaws,This game is the best snowboarding game I have ever played. The flaws of the game are the explorer competitions you have to do to beat the game. Besides that i highly recommed this game. I think it is much better than ps2's cool boarders. If you like snowboarding games than this is your game.
2,Great Graphics semi-fun game play,"I bought this game on a whim. It has great graphics and a large assortment of mp3s. The playability and fun factor for this game are not that great. It's a great game for a bunch of friends to play for no more than 30 minutes. That is the only time I play it. The moves get kinda old and the fact that you can't go just anywhere around the mountain.. yes there are boundaries... The best game out on the XBox at this current time is Halo. If you are looking at this title and do not yet own Halo and are a ""mature"" gamer I would highly recommend purchasing HALO first and reading more reviews on Amped. It is not that great of a game, I'm waiting for a better snowboarding game. Thx."
4,Wickedly amazing. Fantastic game,"The freedom to move anywhere on the huge, fanstastically detailed mountains make the game worth buying. The tricks, soundtrack and snow effects are gravy. I really wish it supported simultaneous multiplayer ( especially across xbox's ) but its still good."
4,My first Xbox sports game,"I recently bought an Xbox and am slowly building up my game collection. I had a demo of ""Amped2"" and loved it. However I found ""Amped"" for a good price and thought I would try it. I must say that it is fantastic and very addictive. There are quite a lot of controls to learn to really do well on high scores but it is a lot of fun learning to play. The hardest part for me is the rails. With a limited budget, I have to start with some of the older games, and this one is well worth the money. It is hilarious to try a front flip and end up landing on your head. Great game."
3,good and bad,"This game is not terible but then again i've seen better. The graphics are good, but the tricks are basic, carrer mode [is bad], Tony Hawk 2x is a much better game. If your going to buy a game go buy Tony Hawk 2x not Amped. I strongly reccomend to RENT this game before spending [the money]."
1,Amped is good?? NOT!!,"At first Amped may seem pretty cool, but the game play [is bad]. You only have a limitted trick use and you only land about half of them. The graphics are good but thats it. Once you get into the game it gets hard and pretty soon your stuck. Don't rely on the codes to get you out of this one."
3,it is the best snowboarding game,"this game totally rocks, it could knock ssx tricky right out of the sky. it is down right realistic with an awesome soundtrack and graphics. dark summit is a joke, so if you want a solid snowboarding game, get amped: freestyle snowboarding"
5,AWESOME!!!!!,this game is AWESOME!!!!! I luv 2 snowboard so it's really kewl! The graphics r really great and the music is 2!!!!! GET THIS AWESOME GAME!!!!!!!
5,The Midget,It is so fun it is to fun I would buy it it has great graphics it is fun for all ages Fun for hours and Hours it is the best game eaver made from a company and is for two playersP.S. It is cheap only at Amazon!MIDGET
4,"Fun game, great soundtrack",This is a fun boarding game with great music. The runs are great with lots of jumps and rails (still trying to figure out the rails though). I have two girls 8 & 5 who also love this game and have even beaten me at it! Even if you don't score a lot of points it is still fun just boarding down the mountian! My girls think it is especially funny to see dad do a major wipe out into a tree or ski lift pole! My only complaint is that I wish more runs were open for those of us who just want to board down the mountain and are not interested in competing for a high score!
3,its alright,this game is alright not that great the graphics are really good same goes for sound thx to the xbox.the controlls [are bad] so much.if they gave u a tutorial first i wouldve been a lot better.i think sssx tricky looked better anyway.
4,Death Goes Dutch,"An interesting story about a man that is faced with proving his identity to his adoptive family. Written in first person from the point of view of a woman that is trying to help him, Death Goes Dutch is definitely an interesting story. The main character Sarah tries to help Josh prove his identity to his less than welcoming family and discovers family secrets along the way that definitely make this book a page turner. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes mysteries."
5,"Even better than ""Deceptions""","I just finished reading ""A Tangled Web"" and like it even more than volume 1, ""Deceptions"".Judith Michael doesn't waste much time getting into the continuing story of Sabrina and Stephanie. After 10 pages the author(s) have told the readers what happened in ""Deceptions"" and from that page on it really is unputdownable.A wonderful book and at least as good as part 1. Too bad they never made a movie about the sequel. The Provence would have made a beautiful scenery for the movie location!My advice: read ""Deceptions"", the read ""A Tangled Web"" and finally get the movie ""Deceptions"" with Stefanie Powers who definitely was the best choice for playing Stephanie and Sabrina in the movie (mini TV series)."
3,I was sadly disappointed.,"I was disappointed with this sequel. I loved ""Deceptions"", but found this novel tedious. It took much to long to get to the point. I also found that I had little respect for the main characters. Just tell the truth! To go on with deceptions of the magnitude that they did seems totally improbable in incomprehensibile to me."
3,And old book with new ideas,"With so many books on the subject of hypnotism coming out like flies on a mule ass, and being writing by arm chair hypnotists, knowing that 98 precent of them never been in a hypnotic state in their life. I found that this book is not only informative but one of the best on the market. As a professional hypnotist for more than 27 years, Dr. Van Pelt knows his stuff and have practice it very well. As a past president of the British Society of Medical Hypnotists a hard spot to achieved in Britain he also author five books. One of the books title ,Hypnotism and its Therapeutic Value in Medicine (1949 Medical Press) was highly praise by Les Cron and Cheeks . Two well known masters of the profession. Don't let the low price fool you. Yes there are believe it or not overprice books that are worthless and do teach bad hypnosis, and can be used as good door stops. A must buy to see what real hypnosis was really like."
2,"Solidly built, uneven legs, has a smell","I bought 4 of these. They are very solidly built and easy to assemble. Two of them have slightly uneven legs. One has a stink to it, like some small animal died inside the padding."
3,the only office etiquette book you'll ever need,"Having seen and been distressed by other ""bluff your way..."" books I saw BYWIOP on a shelf in a store and thought, here's a ""how to bluff"" book that is about a field that is all bluffing! This should be full of useful information, or at least as entertaining as Dogbert!I picked up the book and was proven correct. This book is very at home next to ""Dogbert's top secret management handbook"" on my shelf and would fit that way on any cynical bureaucrat's bookshelf."
1,Design runner,"I sent this back. Not worth the money. It doesn't start writing until halfway across the paper, and it isn't anything I couldn't do on my printer already. Not worth the investment."
4,wireless fun,I enjoy using my design runner handheld cordless printer.The instructions are easy to understand and to begin using.There is also pictures of on the instructions. I haveshown it to many friends already. You must get one.
4,Conspiracy and Romance,"Women have been disappearing in Cornwall, so when penniless Sara Cobb gets a warning to turn down her new position as governess and flee, she is hesitant. But the rogue who issues the warning is a shady character as well. Good romance with a deep conspiracy."
4,Well Done,"Great research in a military intelligence gathering style. Good military analysis of the event. Book length, but a short story due to large font. I am suspect to some details, such as the use of ""Britsh 62nd Regt of Foot or Royal Americans"" when he may mean the 60th Regt. A major error I think."
4,Good!,"Seeing the homosexual lifestyle, their challenges and struggles, helps me to better reach out to them and understand their hearts."
5,Thompson answers Christian Questions about Homosexuality,"I loved this book. It answers the question of ""is it a choice"" in a fresh way that both Christians and homosexuals can agree with. He recommends that we love homosexuals to bring them to Christ rather than the fire and brimstone option.And he does this by sharing his journey into and out of the homosexual life style.Recommended reading for anyone who had friends,family, neighbors, co-workers that are gay and who wonders how to respond to them with a Christian perspective.I shared this book with my mother is a lesbain and we were able to find may places to begin a conversation about ""lifestyle"" and Christ's love."
3,"Good tips, not really for budget cooks","Seriously, this is not a series for those who are cooking on an instant ramen budget (fast and cheap). There are ingredients used that, while good, are either expensive or rare = you would have to use them extensively to make them worth the cost.The tips on cooking things with an oven and stove for the same dish --> work, already tried them, but they do require spending more time and money on your energy bill.READ THE EPISODE SUMMARIES. Some topics that they go through in an episode aren't really connected, so if you are looking for a particular tip or recipe, read the summary first, then go through the episode."
1,bad packaging and dvd broken bad,Package was recieved and dvd csse was shattered at bottom snd dvds were briken in center in more than one place
5,best whisk ever!,"i love how nothing gets stuck in the whisk, the wires are strong & durable, and the handle is ergonomically designed so it's very easy to use. this is my first whisk, and i never knew how good i had it until i used a friend's whisk which was horrendous to use. having a bad tool in the kitchen can really ruin your cooking mojo, so i highly recommend this whisk."
4,"Nice, Sturdy Whisk","I really enjoy this whisk compared to many others I have tried, but I wish they would have made the handle just a bit lighter. The metal is very study and holds its shape well. I have had to go in between the wires to dig out dough and pretty much abuse the wires and the whisk has been no worse for wear. It still looks brand new even after regular use."
5,Well worth the money.,"I've owned this whisk for about a year now and it's the best whisk I've ever owned. I love it (and must admit that I love all things Zyliss), but truly this whisk is well made, great handle - it has a weight to it that makes it easy to hold and use. I feel like I'll never need or want another type of whisk - this one does it all. With the ends open, it is a breeze to clean and it doesn't rust like the traditional ones tend to do after a while."
3,"Works, but design could be better","Whisks well, but....the top heavy handle & slick handle drives me nuts. My habit of resting whisk inside bowl during pauses just isn't compatible w/ the design - almost before I've released the handle it slides into the mix ""or"" flips over edge of bowl. It's like a brain teaser for me & the whisk wins every time & I'm fishing it out of the batter- handle & all. If handle had some traction on it & weighed less it could be perfect - at least for me."
5,very handy,"this whisk is the one that i use in priority when I need to beat eggs for an omelet, yolks for a cake, or even cheese. I like it because the wires separate at the top and allow any accumulation of flour and eggs, for instance, to escape from these wires and be beaten to obtain a smooth blend. The whisk is very handy because it is neither too long nor too heavy. As such my plastic bowl does not lose its equilibrium. The plastic handle has a very pleasant touch and allows a beautiful grip. The small length allows efficient moves to blend without leaving lumps. In short, I do not need to mix for ever. Excellent. I sent one to my mother as a gift to her wrists!!! I put it on top in the dishwasher and have had no problems with the plastic handle."
2,On Balance,"Sturdy, good materials, and as a whisk works very well, but poorly balanced; handle is so heavy it tips over if you try to leave it inside or resting on the parameter of a bowl. I don't particularly recommend it."
5,Good Whisk,"I read a lot of reviews on this before buying, and found that most complaints surrounded the weight of the handle. We've used it and found we don't really see the issue. The whisk is good, easy to clean and solidly made. haven't had any problems yet where the handle has tipped the whisk out of the pot or bowl."
3,"Wrong product dimensions, heavy.","The design of the whisk is ok, but as others have mentioned, the handle is very heavy relative to the whisk part. The product dimensions also state an incorrect length: it is actually 10"" long from the base of the handle to the tip of the whisk. I don't know where they got 14.5"" from."
3,Should have known better,"I should have known better, but it looked good and was really cheap. It is stiffer than a good whisk ought to be. The handle, the whole thing is slightly short and has a way of falling down into the bowl that a more professional whisk would not.The idea of it not connecting at the end seems like a groovy advantage, but this is not a critical problem with most piano wire style whisks.It seems to be sturdy, easy to clean, but I'll probably find someone to give it to who won't know the difference."
4,Solid but top heavy,I generally like Zyliss products and added this one to my kitchen. It does a great job of whipping up liquids and is simple to clean but it IS top heavy. As another review stated it does tend to fall out of the bowl unless you're using a large bowl. I have no regrets purchasing this item.
5,The Best Whisk,"This whisk is way beyond any whisk I've ever owned. It's handle is sturdy & heavy so the whisk is extremely well balanced & easy to use. Zyliss has earned a permanent customer. If I need anything else like this, I'll buy from them."
2,Lame,"Lame, don't bother, unless you just MUST see some massed bands wondering the street playing mostly in disarray, with a couple of exceptions."
1,Worst Pogo Stick Ever!,I just bought this toy today (at another store) and luckily took it out of the box and tried it in the parking lot. There is NO WAY my 8 year old would be able to make this thing bounce. I weigh 120 and only was able to move it about an inch. Horrible! Don't waste your time or money!
4,Nice assortment,As with any gift assortment it's the idea and not the quantity that you are buying. Still a good package though.
2,New Faces--Old Memories,"I purchased this product for nostalgia--I saw the stage show in San Francisco in 1953. As nostalgia, it was most enjoyable; as theater in today's high tech expectations, it is underwhelming. If you would enjoy seeing these fledging stars in their professional infancy (Eartha Kitt, Paul Lynde, Robert Clary, Alice Ghostley9, I heartily recommend it. The technical quality is uneven; some scenes are, in a word, terrible. I also bought the separate music on a CD and the sound quality on it is much better. I listen to the CD often, but will watch the DVD infrequently."
3,Mixed bag,"New Faces of 1954, in its Broadway form, was clever and great fun. The video version, which introduces a silly plot and changes the order of the skits from the original, loses some of the original vitality, but enough is left to reward the aficienado. And no one can ever hear enough of the young Eartha Kitt."
1,not so good,"Pretty bad movie all round but at least it was good to have it to add to my 20th Century Fox CinemaScope collection. What more can I say, you either want it or you don't."
3,Old Faces Now,"Although I enjoyed seeing this film again, I was disappointed in that it wasn't the original film. A couple of items I was especially looking forward to were cut from it and replaced by Earth Kitt singing songs she made popular after the film was made and the Revue was on stage. Eartha Kitt is not everyone's favourite and whoever transposed the film should not have assumed we'd rather hear songs from Eartha than the original skits that were cut. I can't buy the tape as I have PAL in Australia or else I would buy the tape as another reviewer said the skits I wanted to see were on it.Still, I enjoyed what was there even though the quality of the DVD was poor.Annette."
1,New Faces,"If, like me, you were hankering for this classic Broadway show-movie to reappear on DVD, then you may, also like me, weep at the poor quality of the transfer. It looks like one of those blurry out-of-focus old prints made from a TV broadcast: the colour is dreadful, the sound likewise, and the 'DIGITALLY RESTORED' on the front cover is a poor joke. Sure, it's cheap, and as a souvenier of a great show, it may be the best we're likely to see on DVD. Would that this had not been so. Sadly, only for The Desperate To Have ..."
3,Some old faces in NEW FACES,"Paul Lynde and Alice Ghostley (""Bewitched""), Robert Clary (""Hogan's Heroes""), Carol Lawrence and especially Eartha Kitt all made their initial impressions in this classic revue first on Broadway in 1952. Highlights include Ghostley, Lynde and Ronny Graham in a spoof of the Arthur Miller/Clifford Odets genre entitled ""Of Fathers and Sons"" written by Mel Brooks; Ghostley's solo by Sheldon Harnick, ""Boston Beguine""; Lynde's self-penned parody ""Trip of the Month"" and the grisly/funny hoedown finale ""Lizzie Borden"". The lame ""plot"" attached to the original (which had none) is hard to sit through and some of the performers are easier to take than others. Eartha Kitt's solos reveal how little she has changed in the past 50 years, at least in persona and material. But as one of the few records of the late-era Broadway revue, this is a must-see."
1,DON'T!,"Movie was wonderful But this transfer to DVD is a travesty! The color shifts from red to pink to orange without warning and certainly not to the intent of the original producers of the movie! Don't understand why this fine movie was released this way on DVD. If you loved the original movie, don't get this one. The CCM version of this DVD is exactly the same, by the way. Wait until Twentieth Century-Fox decides to put this one out on DVD (the original releasing company)."
1,New Faces Obliterated?,"This is the WORST transfer of a movie that I have ever seen. Does Twentieth Century Fox know what was done with this movie? They released it originally but I guess they are not responsible for the devastation that has ensued. It is so poorly done that there are wavy lines at times and the color goes in and out. It was supposed to be a digital transfer but it is a travesty. This should never have been allowed to be released. The original company that did this, CCM, should be severely chastized for even thinking about putting their name on it!"
3,Some good stuff but hasn't aged very well . . .,"The English are often a puzzlement to us Yanks, whether we're trying to do business over there or merely reading Dorothy Sayers over here. Smith, a novelist, short story writer, and columnist, has done a pretty good job at explaining various odd English-isms, such as kippers, the jug of ale vs. the straight glass, the six kinds of football, and the tendency to reply to ""Thank you,"" with another ""Thank you."" He also supplies tidy little mini-essays on quintessential English writers such as Jane Austen, Anthony Burgess, Stephen Spender, and A. J. P. Taylor -- even when they're actually Irish, like George Bernard Shaw. Considering that this book was written seventeen years ago, some of his efforts haven't worn so well, especially the essays on each of the decades of the 20th century and almost every mention of the Labour Party and of Margaret Thatcher. Still, I've always wondered what the Cotswolds were. . . ."
3,"Content great, kindle format has some problems","I am using this text for a class and I was excited to see it was in kindle format. The book has great content and is relatively easy to follow. The problem lies in the way it was formatted for digital copies. The examples for the exercises are in small font and can't be enlarged because the image quality is low. There are also random black splotches that are mostly just nuisances, but sometimes interfere with the ability to read the text itself. If I were to rate the book it would get five stars, but the digital copy with all its issues would get 1 so I compromised with three stars. Because of the difficulties with the exercises that make it very hard to do homework, I wish I would have spent the extra money for the book itself."
1,Same stuff,Just another Donna Dewberry book with the same designs painted on different surfaces. I was very disappointed that there was nothing new offered in this book.
5,Donna Dewberry Garden--love it!!,I love Donna Dewberry and her work!! This book is not a disappointment at all! So glad I purchased it and I got it for a great price!
5,A true worship experience,"Thirsty is a cd that takes you right into the presence of God. The songs will have you enter right into the presence of God like never before, rather you're in your bedroom, at work, in the living room where ever you may be. This cd is awesome, it's a must have for everyone. I have all of Marvin Sapp's music but by far this one takes you into the holy of holies, a rheme in the spirit that reaches the third heaven. One of my favorites on the cd is ""Never would of made it without you""."
2,No stage presence,Just listen to the CD it will provide a better experience because then you can use your imagination. Just sayin'
5,I watch this over and over.....,...and over and over. You WILL be blessed! Every single song will have your attention. Very professionally put together!
1,Not a working product,"Although the CD was wrapped nicely, the CD does not work at all and I tried different CD players. Its just not worth the effort to re-package and send it back. I'm done ordering on line though Amazon."
4,"Up to date, good guide","Overall, this is a good book and worth getting. It's valuable to me, a local; but more-so to people traveling in the area.It gives good stats on the brewpubs (and beer bars) including beer lineups, hours, brew system specs and capacity, directions, nearby attractions, etc...Then there's bios on the breweries, a bit on the brewers, and the beer, obviously.If there's a downpoint, it's that the author was a bit generous with the beer criticism. He didn't slam certain beers or breweries as hard as I would have. I've tasted many infected or downright horrible beers from some of the places he praises."
2,Not strong enough,"Although cute serving trays, they were only used for decorating the table because they were not strong enough to hold snacks for the party."
3,Paper,I guess I didn't read well enough...I though these were plastic. They're paper. Oh well. They should still work.
3,Not what I expected,"When I placed an order for this axe I assumed it would be an American made product; it's not. Ames is one of the oldest American companies still in business, and True Temper has been making axes for a long, long time. But the head is made in Taiwan, and the axe is assembled and finished in Viet Nam. Not that this is necessarily detrimental to the product, but the quality is just nowhere near the level of similar American made tools. On the plus side, the shipping was very fast and the packing was very well done. It may be unreasonable to expect an American made axe to be for sale at such a low price, but country of origin should really be listed on tools."
1,Grill pro,Instructions need illustrations to explain written words since they are not clear enough. Not sure how to interpet. Still can't tell if my tanks need more propane or not.
3,Propane needs to be in use,"Well, it works but it's not the most convenient. See, it uses temperature to tell you the level (when propane is in use the bottle gets cold). It doesn't tell you the actual level but it will tell you whether the propane level is higher then where you place this thing.For example, you place this indicator just below the halfway point on a 20lb tank. Near the bottom. Until the propane gets that low, the indicator will say it's full. Only when you have used more then half will the indicator tell you how much is left.This pisser is you have to be using the propane for this to work. We use it for the propane bottle on our tent trailer. We use the propane only at night for the heater. So, I can only check the level at night, but that's my situation, yours might be different).Anyway, it works well enough and as long as I check it before heading to bed, I know whether to fill up the next day or not."
2,Too inconsistent and unreliable.,"I am everyday griller and followed the directions to a T, this item is too unpredictable and unreliable, I am going with the tank gauge with the hook and weigh method for $10.00. I do NOT recommend this to anyone and want to save you time and money, I learned from this purchase and even the guy who filled my tank called them junk."
2,not so good,Bought several of these as gifts..all 6 folks said did not work as promised. Most preferred the more expensive valves you simply add to your propane tank and it gives you a reading. Most newer propane tanks/BQues all ready have a level or device that tells you what your propane tanks level is. Propane tanks have an expiration date..if you are due a replacement..suggest you look at some place like costco..we got a new tank with special valve indicator for 26.00..propane was extra.
2,CONFUSING,"I have found that reading the gas level indicator is really confusing. I am not a stupid person, but when you look at this and try to read it, well, I feel like I am. lol. It seems as if I am guessing at the level indicated. It is not real straight forward. I would definitely not buy this again, nor would I recommend it to a friend."
5,A great reference guide to do-it-yourself landlords,"After purchasing this book by Attorney Mark Warda, I have found his insight into the real estate laws of Florida invaluable. The easy to read format of the book along with the flowcharts and associated legal forms makes owning rental property less stressful. Common legal problems that a landlord encounters are addressed. A ""must get"" for the do-it-yourself landlord."
1,"A failure, plain and simple","It's been over 20 years since I started a book and couldn't finish it...until I started this one. I had seen all the poor reviews and thought, ""Damn, how bad can this book really be?"" Well, it has some good pictures. That's the end of the positives.Terribly sentence structure. Massive amounts of typographical errors, as well as grammatical errors. Not sure if the author is just a poor writer or if Schiffer Publishing did a terrible job editing it. Since I've seen several other books published by Schiffer with poor editing, I'd say the poor result is not entirely the author's fault.Look at the pictures and then move along. You'll thank me for all the time you would have wasted reading this piece of garbage."
1,Just as others have stated...terrible!,"At the risk of ""piling on"" I must add my proverbial two-cents to this. To paraphrase one reviewer, how did this ever get into print?!? Aside from the lifeless and amateur writing itself, the number of spelling, grammatical and similar errors of that nature are mind-boggling. I began noting the errors, and in the first 50 or so pages, I believe perhaps 4-5pages were error free! Simply embarrassing... I just put the book down about a third of the way through - not worth wasting my time with!Avoid this at all costs!"
3,Many errors and bad grammar but some interesting information on Wittmann and Tigers in battle,"I agree with the other reviewers that the book is awful in terms of grammar and the language used, but I think that it is quite unfair to throw it in the dustbin. The are many good black and white photos and some chapters, like that of the Tiger crews training, the Kursk battle, and of course the Villers-Bocage epic engagement against teh Desert Rats are very well presented, with a lot of tactical details. Not a bad choice for the tank enthusiasts after all, but the price is indeed high."
2,Not Happy,"I received my book which I must say was very quick, about 2 weeks but every line of type in the book has been highlighted in different colours. It was not mentioned when I purchased it."
1,"Good Content, terrible presentation !","I have spent a lifetime reading war history books. This one, hands down, for the size and cost, is the most poorly written one I have ever read. Too bad. The author clearly did his homework. But the writing just stinks ! For example, the constant reuse of the phrase, ""all and every"" was completely unnecessary. Unlike Barry Thomas, who states that he could not get past page 10, I read the entire book. The only part of the book that I read that I was not irritated by the writing style was the battle in Viller-Bocage. I truly thought this book must have been (poorly) translated to English. But in the Appendix, a reference is made about the author being an American !!!"
1,This is the last book by Schiffer that I will ever read!,"To put it bluntly, and mildly, this book stinks! It was printed in China, and I think it was written by someone studying English as a second language. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!! Use the extortionary price as a down payment on a nice condo......"
1,Author should go to school..Schiffer should hire an editor!,"I was SOOO disappointed. I really wrestled with whether or not to write to Amazon.com about this book. Imagine my surprise when I read the reviews from 4 other similarly disappointed customers! The author had the opportunity to write a great book. Instead, he spent most of his time fantasizing about what Wittman felt, said, and did, that at best, he wrote a corny novel! ""Write"" however, is a far too generous description. The author hasn't a clue about how to use the English language. In fact, after two chapters, I assumed this was just a very bad translation from German. But with a surname ""Simpson"", I am afraid the author has adopted English as his native tongue. One suggestion...study the use of the language!! As for Schiffer, they REALLY let down the author and audience by not editing this book. I will certainly steer away from future Schiffer publications because of the lousy job on this book."
1,Maddening,"I wish I had read these reviews before I bought this awful book. The other reviewers are exactly right, it reads like a book translated out of German by first year German students. I couldn't even read 10 pages of it, even though I very much wanted to learn about the subject. You would think that with the extortionate prices Schiffer charges for their books, they could hire an editor."
1,Villers Bocage Fantasy,"I agree with the other reviews that Mr. Simpson's book is very poorly written. Its greatest failing, however, is the appalling inaccuracy of its description of the Villers Bocage battle. What Mr. Simpson has offered as ""fact"" (supported by a hilariously self-serving question-and-answer appendix) is so far of the mark that one has to question whether Mr. Simpson did even the most basic research. One only has to look at Michael Wittmann's own account of the battle (given in an interview conducted the day of the fighting) to see that Mr. Simpson's account is hopelessly in error. This book will no doubt contribute to the gobs of misinformation currently surrounding Wittmann and his exploits. Avoid this book and instead purchase Patrick Agte's book, ""Michael Wittmann and the Tiger Commanders of the Liebstandarte."" Although it is three times the price of Simpson's book, it is sensibly translated (from German) and is the most comprehensive book on Wittmann available."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! A waste of money! ZERO STARS!!!,"This book starts with a great premise - the recounting of the career of the most successful German tank commander of WWII.That is where the great ends and misery begins. Most of the text is generalizations about either German military life or campaigns of the LAH, with little factual account of Wittman's specific actions.Beyond the weak narration, the spelling and grammar are horrid. This just compounds the feeling of frustration. I am (angry) that this book ever made its way into print. Where is quality control?"
2,"Good subject, poor editing","I have not finished this book. It is very difficult to read, I must agree with another review. On reading, it appears to be a very poor translation, however it was written by an American. Sentence structures are atrocious and cumbersome. Furthermore, although the book is a biography of Michael Wittman, much of what is discussed in the chapters on Poland and France is not about Wittman, but his regiment. I did not buy the book for that purpose. I have read numerous books from Schiffer, many suffer from problems with translations and editing. This is the worst. What particularly bothers me is that Schiffer publishes titles and subjects not often found in mass print and I buy their books specifically for that purpose. They are expensive however, I may think twice in the future before purchasing if they cannot do a better job."
1,Extensive grammatical errors make this book unreadable.,"I really wanted to read about Michael Wittman, I really did. But this book is so poorly written it is impossible to get through it. Just about every paragraph has a grammatical error and many have several errors. There are misspelled words, missing words, sentences that change tense....the list is endless. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this book. Now I am stuck with an unreadable piece of [work]. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this book at all costs!"
1,What a horrible book!,"I wish that there was a rating lower than one star for this book. I have tried to read this book two or three times but cannot force myself to endure the punishment associated with wading through so many grammatical errors and poorly written sentences. I honestly thought that it was a translated book (from German) than had lost something of the true meaning in the translation (you know how a translator will sometimes interprete something literally and it won't sound right in the translated language). It is however, written by someone whose ""mother tongue"" is English!! The bottom line - don't, under any circumstances, waste your money on this book."
1,Items looks different than what is pictured,"The photo of this item has 18 slots of beads, but the actual product only has 12 slots of beads (including 1 that is just filled with a a warning about choking hazards, not beads). Therefore there are not as many varieties of beads. There are no purple beads, blue round beads, gray beads and the product is probably missing more. I would have thought I received the wrong item except for the product name is the same on the package. Boo."
4,great toy,These beads are great.The only negative is you have to tie the ends instead of being able to put an actual hook.Or maybe they could of sent something with elastic.Other than that my daughter really enjoyed all the beads and charms!
3,Motor Arbor,"The item pictured is not the item recieved, the item you will recieve is the same as the kind found on Harbor Freight Tools website. It is cheaper from here, but you can at least see a picture there and get an idea of dimentions. This product did not work for me because the distance between the screws are different than the arbor pictured."
1,Ripped off!,The item pictured is not what I received. What I did get were the same cheap ones that are sold by Harbor Freight. I already had some of those and was looking for a heavier duty arbor like the one pictured
2,"Pictures, not music.","Several tiny pictures of/by Ansel Adams. No professional -(or even good quality amateur)-music. Interesting to look at the booklet, but the music has little or nothing to offer. I'm not sorry I bought it though, because any additional information about Adams is valuable and enlightening. He was a creative wonder! -Paul Sjolund"
2,Weak Bushing on Head,"The tripod legs themselves seem very solidly constructed and the overall appearance is good. The design is unique and ingenius as far as the column and tilt setup for macro/closeup photography. Here's the design flaw though, the bushing that is on top of the head is not actually screwed onto the bolt. It slides up and down freely. The 9370 is rated at 22 pounds of support, so I tried to put an equivalent head on it. I screwed it on and then......gently.....snugged up the set screws and the bushing snapped off right at the base. This is not an easy repair. I wound up using a bushing for a Slik Monopod that I had to fix the issue. I have had two of these 9370 series because I liked the design, but have had issues with the heads. If Giottos would correct that problem, they'd have a real winner. I am not too comfortable with $5000 in camera equipment hanging off the head design with the current bushing set up though."
5,Touches your heart,"Author Marianne writes a wonderful account about her work as a Medium. She takes the reader on a personal journey of her life and how these experiences have enriched her soul as she helps others.It is a book about understanding the soul. Each of us has lost someone very dear to us. Grief, depression, and overwhelming sadness can be better understod by reading this book.Marianne Michaels touches the inner being with her gifts.She writes to tell us that if we try to touch the sky-we can, and by doing so, we will speak to the spirits that we lost and grief is soon just a memory."
5,Raise him right!,"The baby Hellboy is the reason you should buy this set. He is simply awesome. His has ball-jointed shoulders, ball-jointed neck, and his stone fist rotates. He also stands up perfectly on his own. His cloven feet are a nice touch.As far as educational value, Hellboy is the ultimate tale of nuture over nature. Born bad? There is no such thing in the Hellboy tale.It doesn't seem baby Hellboy will appear in series 2 at all. You won't regret buying this one (Rasputin is great too, the apparatus on his hand is removable and he is well articulated and painted). When you compare the Mezco Hellboy line with the hundreds of dollars you could spend elsewhere on ""collectible"" Hellboy stuff the Mezco stuff is even more amazing."
2,dull very quickly with mild steel,Cutting steel fence posts and EMT these blades dull very quickly. My old Milwaukee blades lasted much longer and would cut 4-5 times as much material as these sawzall blades. The Lenox don't work any better and I would not mind paying more to get blades that would last and not need to be changed frequently.
1,More Disappointment from Snowy,"I bought this album for $3 in the 'get rid of it bin', which says most of it. Snowy has always had a lot of potiential which is frustratingly never reached. I believe he needs to: 1. Fire his producers (himself and Kuma Harada) and find someone to bring the best out of the songs. 2. Snowy is a talented guitarist, but on too many of the tracks, his guitar is relegated to the middle background. 3. Snowy's voice is not bad, but it seems to always intrude.So many of the tracks start off seeming not too bad, but never rise to the expected level. Chris Rea, Garry Moore and Dave Gilmour are all totally wasted on their appearances."
1,A bit of a poseur.,"I bought this after reading that Whitman is an American original. His writing is lazy, and he is a bit of a poseur: musings, beard, hat and all."
4,Walt Whitman Is My Muse!,"As the author of ""Of Life Immense: The Prophetic Vision of Walt Whitman,"" I have many copies of ""Leaves of Grass,"" along with many other books about Walt Whitman. The ""Library of America Edition"" is very well done, beautiful to read and wonderful to hold. Justin Kaplan""s commentary is insightful and his selection of Whitman's prose provides the reader with significant understanding of Whitman's life. If you have only one book by and about Walt Whitman, this may well be the book you should have."
2,Poor product,The hooks themselves are small and wimpy. The magnets are pretty weak. These hooks weren't strong enough to hold a spatula. Might be okay for very light items.
1,Disapointing,"This is an totally new version of a classic book. Instead of the classic work of Holt, much of it is a 'commentary' by the new author.I didn't like the 'new' version. I bought this to learn from Holt, not read someone's 'commentary."" I grew frustrated that instead of letting me read what Holt wrote, there was a ton of the new author stating ""Holt said in Teach your own....""Also, I didn't like that Farenga cut out big chunks of the book. ie he decided that we didn't 'need' to know about the histories of court rulings, and in one instance took the parent testimonials that Holt had used in one section the original book and added 'more moderntestimonials.""I got so frustrated that I bought a used copy of the original from Amazon. I got it yesterday and have read almost all of it. The original is really great.The 'new' version reads as if was written by someone who really doesn't like unschooling.I would recomend the 'classic' version!"
4,Refreshing perspective on learning,"As a teacher at a private school and a homeschooling mom, this book gave me a refreshing perspective on education and learning - both at a structured school and at home. The philosophy of John Holt was what I have read about from ""unschoolers"". I think it is important to consider whether we are motivating our children to learn or teaching them to spit back what we think is important. This book gave me much food for thought in that area."
3,Ehh! I don't know? How much time you got?,"I Guess it works, but seems to be more of a mess to clean up than cutting it out with a razor knife. Could work on hard to get to multi-level surfaces."
4,Did the Job....Not Cheap!,"This stuff got the job done. My old shower stall was installed with large amounts of Slicone caulk. I tried several other products and nothing worked. It was looking like I was going to have to dig the old Silicone out with a screwdriver and hammer. However, I came across this stuff on Amazon and decided to try it out despite the price. I followed the directions to the letter. Wow! This product worked amazingly well and was worth every penny."
4,Made the job SO much easier!,"Not only did it save me hours of tedious work, I can rest assured that the old silicone caulk was completely removed and that I'll have a perfect seal with the new caulk.I found it easiest to apply by hand -- with rubber gloves, of course. It didn't have much of an odor and cleaned up really easily. It took about two-thirds of the 8 oz. tube to cover the seam around our bathtub."
2,Not what's it's hyped up to be,"Works fine as long as you are removing caulk on a horizontal surface. Will not clling to seams that on walls or ceilings, or along sides of fixtures"
5,awesome!,YAY!!!! best Ringo Starr book i have seen out there!!! I JUST WISH IT HAD PICTURES!!!!! It is thick and has tons of information. Any Ringo Starr fan would just love to own this book. It comes with interviews and just detailed info on all his songs and about everything Ringo related! I LOVE IT!
4,Love this! But is it worth ten THOUSAND dollars???? No!,"I love He-Man, I grew up watching it and I was totally psyched to see it on DVD. I eventually got them all but this one (season two vol. 1). Well, as an avid fan I just had to finish my collection. You can imagine my disgust when I saw that some parasite was selling it on the marketplace for $10,000! Are you kidding me? I can't believe people think they can get away with stuff like this. Well, anyone interested should know it is available online for a reasonable price. I just bought it-- brand new-- for $22 plus shipping.Shame on you for attempting to sell this volume for such an outrageous price. Especially since the series is being re-released in a box set very soon. Good luck with that..."
4,He-man still Most Powerful,"I was a child of the 80's and I must say I still love my Saturday Morning Cartoons. The cartoons these days are pretty weak sauce, but the 80's rocked big part due to He-man. To watch He-man again in beautiful DVD quality and sound, made me feel like I did on saturdays. When Prince Adam said in the intro ""I have the POWER"" I literally had butterflies again. How something 25 years old can still trigger that emotion is a testament to the hard work and passion of Lou Scheimer and filmation. May He-man truly be eternal, and may the upcoming live action He-man movie not suck."
1,Wrong Author Listed,"This book on hand to hand combat ships from the UK. Note: The author is NOT Darina Allen; a writer of COOKBOOKS; but Christopher McNabb, an author who writes extensively about war and other militaty operations. Make love, not war. The way to peace ;cook a good meal! I recommend Darina Allen's books and Nigella Lawson's are pretty cool too!"
5,Love it!,"I was afraid after I purchased it that it might not fit in my sink, but it fit perfect. It alleviates clutter from my kitchen counter, and it stores nicely underneath the sink when not in use."
5,Great.,It's wonderful and doesn't take up any counter space. Only wish there was a utinsel holder that came with it.
4,Dish Rack,I found that the dish rack is exactly the ideal place to put cups etc after they're rinsed and not yet ready for the dishwasher.i am very happy with the product and how easy you can adjust it to fit any size sink
4,Makes an awesome family night,"This game is cool. There are so many parts of the bible that we read and don't grasp. This game makes you think about those parts. For the kids is cool too. They ask things like, ""who was thrown in the lion's den"", ""who traded their father's birthright for a bowl of soup"", ""how many days it take for God to create the earth"". For the grown ups it's good too. Makes a good family night game."
5,Love this game,"This game is so fun. The title is self explanatory-- hundreds of questions about the bible, with scripture references and short explanations to boot. This game is good for the advanced bible reader or novice because most of the questions are multiple choice, except for the bonus questions (which are really hard). They even have special questions for children so the entire family can play and have fun. Helps you really learn alot about the bible."
5,Great price,"This is a fun family game for those who study the Bible and enjoy games. The price on Amazon was much less than in book stores for the same game. There are questions for the children who play so they may play at the same time as the adults, but it's still fair for them."
5,a worthy buy,"The whole family enjoys playing this game: interesting enough questions and wacky enough answers. Lots of ""I never knew that!"" moments. Bible trivia, cups of hot cocoa, and a crowded table makes for a fond memory."
2,Disappointed,"We are disappointed in this game. Like most games, it is ideal to try them before you buy and that certainly would have been wise in this case. If you have a good grasp of the Bible this game may bore you to sleep. Not only are the Bible questions basic, but the game itself is a bore. I would not recommend buying it unless you want to donate it to your church youth group that could maybe jazz it up with some prizes for correct answers."
4,Fun Christmas story,"I really liked the author's light, engaging style and her use of humor and dialogue. I don't know much about horses myself, but Briggs skillfully weaves in everything you need to know to appreciate the story."
5,Christine in CA,"I really enjoyed this book. Very cute! A great story on service, which showed how the one serving is often the one more blessed than those they serve."
1,that's terrible,"only 3 songs. that's a shame for a total of 15 minutes listenning, and more over for the price."
2,pagination problems,"the story is fine, but changing the font size loses words when i use the kindle reader on a nexus 7"
2,Batttery hog,"In less than a week, we had to change the batteries 3 TIMES. It wasn't being used excessively, my 12 month old only played with it for 5 minutes at a time. She loves it, but I can't afford to keep replacing the batteries."
4,I Wish this hadn't been discontinued,"This little car is so cute and so much fun! All kinds of little characters that make noise or speak when you press them; a little ""key"" that makes the engine starting sound; the Spanish that is being spoken along with the English to learn certain phrases; the miniature keyboard that plays guitar, piano, or harmonica.... it's all excellent. I wish there were a larger size one! No troubles with this at all. However, I have not had to replace batteries yet (which could be another plus!) so I don't know how difficult that might be.My 15 month old, who got this for her 1st birthday, still loves playing with her car!"
2,"Let it go, get over it.","Although there were some very good parts to this book for the most part it was dull, boring, and extremely bitter. The story was, is, and will be one of the best that I have ever read. Ellison must realize, though, that budget constraints MUST dictate what is and is not put on film. There is only so much that could be done at that time and it is not Gene Roddenberry's fault that Harlan Ellison couldn't understand that budgets could not be expanded to the size of the authors ego. If I were saying this to Ellison I would say get over it. What's done is done. James Kirk might be able to change the past but here on earth it can't be done. At least, not yet. Take out the bitterest foreword I have ever read and a few repeats of the screenplay and this book would be rated MUCH higher"
2,Ellison's Flipped,"Ugh! Half the book is Ellison's ranting and raving. I think he's flipped. The original script is interesting, but not too much different than the final script. DC Fontana puts it best in her afterword, saying that it was a great script, but it just wasn't Star Trek enough. She was wrong, though, about Ellison mellowing over the years. The first half of this book is proof."
2,"A big ""C"" for CRYBABY!","Roddenberry was right...Ellison's original script WAS bad. Give me a break...did Harlan ever SEE a Star Trek episode when he wrote this? The rewrite was right on target, and if it wasn't for that rewrite, this story would have not been nearly as successful. Save your cryin' for the next time you get passed up at the award ceremony, Harlan!"
3,For Ellison Fans Only,"If you haven't read Harlan, this is not the place to start. Ellison put a lot into his teleplay, and there are surprising, literary aspects, primarily in asides and instructions for the director ( if, indeed, tv directors every took those seriously ). The ""screenplay"" is not first-class Ellison; for that, see his short story collections, or The Essential Ellison and many other anthologies of his great fiction. Aside from the screenplay, there is a long, rambling rant about the grave injustices Harlan suffered after writing the screenplay. The rant is funny and interesting for the details it reveals about the television industry. But I can't recommend this book to those who aren't big Ellison fans."
3,An interesting read...,"He does go on and on and on a bit, and you have to be careful not get bile on yourself as it gushes out of the book, but if you're hungry for behind-the-scenes ST info, whether truthful or not, it's enjoyable."
3,"Enjoyable, but not as good as I expected!","After hearing all of the praise for Ellison's original script, the script itself was something of a disappointment. Although the basic storyline (which was retained in the the televised version) is wonderful, some of the elements that make the televised episode especially suspenseful had been left out in the original script and some silly stuff added (space pirates indeed!). All told, I almost enjoyed reading Ellison's justifiable, but nasty tirade even more. However, there is no doubt that Ellison is a fine writer who deserved to have been treated better by Roddenberry, who must have been either a habitual liar or a sufferer of chronic memory lapses!"
3,Just read the script,"Ellison's original script is well worth reading. I don't think it would have worked as a Star Trek episode, but as a work in-of-itself, it is marvelous. Skip Ellison's intoductory essay--it sounds like it was written by a whiny child with a thesaurus, and it will detract from your enjoyment of the script."
4,Culture clash--Celtic style,"A charming, comical view of an ex-pats culture clash with the eccentric and at times certifiable residents of an Irish village.Enjoy a bumpy ride through pubs, fish and chips, laundry and love-Celtic Style."
1,Shoe Didn't Fit,"I usually have good luck with Clark's shoes but this one just didn't work, not comfortable at all. Returned them."
5,Great Stuff!,"I used this on my leather wrapped steering wheel, arm rests, and seats. Firstly, it got rid of all the dirt better the cracks. It was very easy to apply and use. Second, it left a very fresh smell. Lastly, the leather was so soft! It left it like it was when I bought it, if not better! Great Product! Highly recommended!"
5,Great story book with beautiful illustrations!,"This is a darling book with wonderful illustrations. A great gift to give with a toy fishing pole and not too long for a bedtime story! I want to see what his book ""Trout"" is like too!"
2,dissappointed,"i was happy that i received the product but was not happy with the amount i got in the bottle, It was supposed to be a 1oz bottle but when i got it the bottle was 1/2 full."
2,Does not work well,"Ok, it did plump my lips a little bit, but it only lasted for about 10 minutes. It has a very strange flavor, I can't describe it, but it is odd, not very pleasant. I think I got a defective bottle because it was less than half full, but for $2.49, it's not worth complaining about. I gave it 2 stars anyways because it made my lips feel velvety soft."
4,a nice sampler of newer ninja tune ish,"this is a good sampler of the newer ninja tune roster. i can't say there is a great diversity among the tracks, even though they are different styles of electronic music, most ninja tune stuff has a similar feel. i would of appreciated some more experimental tunes and hip hop tracks (not really feeling sixtoo at ALL)... I would say the highlights on this sampler are definitely the DIPLO track, whom I will be checking for in the future. His track has a very bouncey southern hip hop feel to it, with some funky and spatter drum n bass undertones. really original and really gets your head noddin. the blockhead, wagon christ and jaga jazzist tracks are my other faves. if just getting into ninja tune, i would recommend their 'funkingfusion' line of compilations before this one, just because they are more diverse and i prefer older ninja tune stuff to this newer crop."
3,Only Tatiana's song is worth it,"If you are a Selena fan buy this album but if you just wanna listen Selena's songs with different styles let me tell you that the song ""Bidi bidi bom bom"" is the one that saves this CD, Tatiana sings it wonderfully and without making many changes to the original version, just for this is worth to buy"
5,wonderful performance with fascinating interview,beautiful performance and disc quality. and fascinating interview with gould about his previous recording compared to this one. highly recommended
1,Incompatible with Microsoft Vista Home Premium & Lousy Support,"I purchased this external drive at Fry's Electronics for an old Imac. A Fry's salesman had recommended the HD080U2E572 to me for its Mac compatibility and, indeed, it worked well with my IMac. I then bought a new Dell PC with Microsoft Vista Home Premium. It won't work with Vista Home Premium and I can't find any driver solution, etc. I contacted AcomData by email one month ago and have gotten no replies. From my research, AcomData's customer service and support is pathetic and their reputation is low for quality too. Their support site doesn't even reference Vista OS! This drive may work with some operating systems, but not with Microsoft Vista Home Premium, and AcomData seems to be a pretty poorly run company overall."
4,A great teaching tool to advance your game!,The great Maurice Ashley is a great motivator for all ages. He teaches all levels of chess players. The lessons continue to advance the levels of the player. A great teaching CD.
5,Law & Order SVU Season 12,"I am very satisfied with my purchase. I have every season of this show. My favorite! I purchased every season through Amazon.com. I always get quick delivery and an excellent product. Whenever I'm looking for a product, I always start at Amazon.com. And that ends my search!"
4,"Great Player, But Bad Batteries!!!","Well, I bought a AV120, and I have filled half of it already. It has great tech. Videos & photos can be seen clearly in color, and the screen isn't that small. All the description Amazon fives explain what it does clear enough, but the only problem it has are the batteries. In a way, it'd be better to have a discman or cd player, for you can change when they expire, but with the Jukeboxes, you have to charge them. On the manual, it says you have to do it for 3hr, but it doesn't explain or tell how much they will last. I charged it for 2hr, and that was how long it lasted, but what if you go on an 8hr trip, and there is nowhere to charge the batteries? Try changing the batteries? that's a good idea, but you have to take the screws, and that ain't as easy. But besides this little defect, it id great. If you'll use it for short trips, it's a great aid to keep you entertained"
3,Mostly Good Study!,"If you're not a Calvinist (and I'm not), you are apt to be anywhere from irritated to irate over the first few studies. But be patient; there's still good information and insight there, and then you can move on to the other yummy chapters. The names of God give great insight into his character and will fill you with greater love, joy and reverence for the Self-Existent, All-Sufficient one."
5,Kay Arthur bible study,any bible study by Kay Arthur is really good. This one is no exception. Knowing what the names of God are adds much richness to bible study
5,"Lord, I Want to Know You","In response to the person who stated this book was a disappointment: as someone who has suffered sexual abuse, Kay's book was a powerful study for me. To learn about God in such a personal way brought much needed healing in my life. I recommend this book highly for self study or for group study."
5,An excellent study guide,We are using this as a group study for a ladies' Sunday School class. The content and questions have profitable depth and insight.
3,Book Review,The book was advertised to be like new with no writing in the book. The book does have extensive writing in the first two chapters. I was really disappointed because all the writing is very distracting.
1,Negative veiw of God,"This is not a book for a Spirit Filled, tongue talking, Word of Faith believer. She wants you to believe that God ""allows"" all the bad things in our lives. She even says that God made her Little Person friend that way for a reason. Doesn't agree with the word of God that I know where it says Satan comes to steal, kill and destroy, but God comes to give life abundantly. Being 3 feet tall and disabled doesn't sound like abundance. In the Bible it says God is love. Well love doesn't hurt. So therefore God doesn't hurt. She really has a messed up view of God. She also uses scripture out of context. So please save yourself the money and don't by this book. If you are a faith person, it will only end up in the trash."
5,Jargon-free guide to codes,"This book is short and sweet. Using non-technical language, Luger describes the various types of code-making techniques in common use, and moves on to lay out how code-breakers ply their trade. This is an excellent book for the beginner because it presents the material in a conversational manner, without ponderous jargon and without overwhelming the reader with technical terms or with arcane mathematics. In short, you won't get bogged down reading this book, as you might with more advanced texts."
1,"Other than the bibliography, the book is weak.","A very superficial and not too well written overview ofcryptography. The best part of the book is the bibliography.Save yourself the $11, and take David Kahn's ""The Code-Breakers"" out from your public library. Unfortunately, itaccording to 'amazon.com' is out of print."
4,"This is a good buy, but tough to play","This game has very good graphics and a great story line. The environment is 3D and very nice. I do believe that it would have been better as a first person shooter game like Halo. However, the game is still worth buying. You may find, as I did that the controls seem extremely hard. I almost gave up on the game because of the difficulty of the controls. Hang in there and eventually you will get used to them. The save points are also a little far apart, so you may find yourself having to replay parts time and time again. Even so, this game is a lot of fun to play and worth the money."
1,what is this?,"This game isn't worth $50, in first place, the story makes no sence, you don't have any videos, the hole story goes true steady images. The enemies are the same, you control four different magic powers, and you fight against enemies of the four different tipes of magic, but they are colored so you know how to kill them. By the way, you can finish this game in a day."
1,Do Not Buy This Junk!,"Maybe because I had just finished ""Halo"" so my expectations were raised for all games but I think this game totally reeks. The third person perspective is [not so good] because you can't see ahead well. BTW, sometimes you can't see the monsters until they are nearly on you. And oh what ""monsters"" seems I spend my time running round killing giant rats and bugs and spiders. Monster rendering is poor, not frightening at all. The only highlight of this game is the spell effects which are cool. Verdict - AVOID THIS GAME, CERTAINLY DON'T PURCHASE IT!"
2,Overall mediocre game...,"Pretty graphics, repetitive gameplay, horrible voice-acting, and under average storyline makes this one a renter- I would strongly recommend NOT outright buying it."
4,Buy some Raid with the game!,"Although I didn't see this in any other review, I found my game to be very buggy. I would get to the end of a level, then it would ask me if I wanted to proceed, I would say yes, then nothing, It would put me back to the end of the level. Also, at the end, fighting the NightCaster, it all of a sudden deceided that my own spells should hurt me and I would kill myself. It took about 8 times to finish due to bugs with the final battle. Also my friend finally had the store replace his copy due to lock-ups. Other than that I thought it was fun, not a diffucult game, graphics were pretty cool, Ice world and it's reflections, WOW! I found the controls easy. All around fun! Good deal, especially with the lowered price."
5,Awesome Game,"I really liked this game because It was different. It issortof like Diablo without the blood, and when I get a newspell I get really excited.Overall this game is awesome andI think they made it really well."
2,Blast the Beasties with Magic.,"Put Harry Potter in Gauntlet Legends and give him a talking Tinker Bell in a bottle and you've got Night Caster. There's no real plot except get through the levels. Until you get to the end of the game the spells [stink]and all the while villagers and an Irish Miss Cleo are whining at you. The graphics have no detail, which makes the game look like it is a 64 game. Like most Xbox games it's not long but everything along the way will annoy you. Better for younger players."
2,Just like hunter the reconing,"Boring! This game has nothing to rave over and alot to dispise. Rent it before buying, or you will be disappointed in losing 50 bucks."
4,It does what it says on the cover,"This is a great book, because it meets the objectives very well. It is not a reference book, or a text book for techies, but a quick start guide to basic Lotus Notes R5 use. I was familiar with R4.5, and so could skip through the book very quickly, gleaning useful tips as I went through it all. For new users this is great, and I have pointed many happy user to the book. And, it is in colour, and very well designed, and structured. I have not read many books that meet their objectives so well. Don't buy it for A-Z, but do buy it to use the software in a very short space of time."
5,knife,this was a good knife it flys right on target and it has hit asphalt a lot no damage great little learning tool
3,Guinea pig is great,"The guinea pig critics might want to consider a few things; dogs, cats, rabbits, etc. don't have heads twice the size of their body; animals don't ride around in treetop carousels, drive boxcars, dine in restaraunts solo; they don't have the wide array of eye colors (purple?) that the littlest pets display. Clearly littlest pet shop is not set in reality, so is it really that big of a deal that the guinea pig is not ""accurate""? My four year old immediately recognized as a guinea pig and loves it every bit as much as the rest of her pets."
4,The Start of Something Good,"Melting (Little Wing) is one of my top 10 albums of all time. The albums following that one such as Restless and especially Live Flames are great, too. But, it is time for me to collect Snowy's earlier work. White Flames from 1983 gives a feeling of what is to come. Snowy has such a unique sound and this album really starts to identify where he is going. This is the album with ""Bird of Paradise"" which is worth the price of the album alone. I also think ""The Journey, Pt 1 & 2"" is great. If just starting the Snowy journey, I'd recommend Melting first and the 2009 Best Of album, but this is a solid early album."
4,A (pretty) good book,"I used it in Cameroon last year and in Niger this year. Although it suffers some weaknesses, like some breeding/non-breeding plumage difference not documented, and like some upper-parts of raptors not shown, this is definitely one of the books any birdwatcher must have in his pocket in the West Africa bush, and I would not leave without it, although it is a little worn out now. The Borrow & Demey is a good complement."
5,Hurrah for the first time writer's success!,"I have not had time to read many novels in the past years, but I was thoroughly entertained and not prone to put this book on the back burner. B. Washburn, the author's son, lent this book to me. I thought ""oh, boy"" someone's just bragging about their son. Instead I found myself reading the novel and my curiousity about some of the bootlegging in our past history was colorfully discovered. The book was well written with a conversational tone.The author questioned his sources well and they provided answers that kept a smile on my face.I would recommend your reading SECRETS ON THE MOUNTAIN because I do not think you'll find the content of the secrets of bootlegging any better in any other book. You'll read about this illegal activity and the in's and out's of bootlegging challenges from a law enforcement officer's point of view with a taste for his family secrets. I have unbiased excellent recommendations for reading and purchasing the book."
1,Dishonest and Repetitive,"I enjoyed Cole's last book but dislike this one. Though Cole aims for a certain kind of truth, the self-hating in this book becomes a mere self-indulgence in poem after poem. Cole tries to elicit the reader's sympathy under the pretense of writing nakedly; instead, Cole simply has settled into a repetitive style. Cole tries to walk ""on an edge,"" to fuse his metaphors into ""one crystalline rock,"" but his self-indulgent, myopic posturing leaves one cold, ""like ice in a champagne bucket."""
1,Died in two weeks,"Probably I have bad luck, but Apple hardware sucks. This thing died in two weeks, and now I have to wait for two weeks for the replacement part to arrive. I also had a G4 that died after warranty and 17 inch flat panel that died also after warranty. If it wouldn't be for mac os X, I will stay away of Mac hardware"
1,Do not buy- looks aren't everything,"First of all, this computer dies after three months. That's just how first generation Mac products are. Don't buy first generation- it WILL die. This thing freezes literally every time I use it.Secondly, Apple doesn't help at all. Tech support doesn't do anything for you. They refuse to honor my one year hardware warranty, and I've talked to customer service AND tech support, and all they do is try to sell you Apple care- why would I want to extend coverage for a product that they already refuse to honor service for? Their service team isn't a service team at all. They are a group of trained salespeople who try to sell you their product. Why should I have to buy Apple care for something that should already be covered?I've grown up on Macs, and loved them all my life. But the company's integrity is going down hill, and this was the last straw. Between the horrible products and the sleazy ""support,"" I'm never buying an Apple product again. Linux, here I come..."
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE,DO NOT BUY! this is the worse product ever. it made my hair brittle and my hair broke with every washing and still continues to break. i don't know what to do now. i had to buy another shampoo to repair the damage that this product did to my hair. its HORRIBLE!
3,Great except...,"No problems with this unit except that I couldn't use the existing controls to precisely center the image. It has an auto-centering feature as a push button, but it does not center it well enough for me. It was still worth the ~$200 I spent for it."
1,Better monitors are available,"This monitor is bright, but the image is somewhat fuzzy. The built-in speaker is very tinny. I sent it back primarily because of the fuzzy problem since I had external speakers that sounded much better.I think you can find better monitors out there that are sharper and similarly priced. I ended up with a 24"" H/P monitor - higher price, fantastic image, very very sharp."
4,music for lovers,"Between Stan and Dexter, I would definitely go with Dexter over Stan on this; put me more in the mood for relaxing (not a bad thing) as opposed to making love."
5,Works great,"Very happy with these. They are a great size for out laundry. We have three of them (darks, whites, and specialmwash items). It replaced a standalone unit with three bags, but these are so much better hidden indoor the counter.They are sturdy and are easy to install."
1,A cheaters way to make music,I wanted a program where i could create my own loops and make my own music. Instead they give you crappy loops to use and to make your own loops it takes 764588076654 hours! biggest disappointment! if you want to be a cheater and use pre-made loops go ahead. Anyone else don't waste your money
1,"Bad, bad, bad","Wow, this book was bad! Don't look for any actual Nietzsche philosophy -- you get the feeling that the author skimmed the Cliff notes. Total pseudo-intellectual lameness.His road trip is...get this...boring! Read about him drinking or doing drugs. Read about him watching TV. Read about him alone in his car or hotel. I didn't like that the author intentionally made the main character stupid just so we could watch him blunder through his life. Don't be fooled thinking this is drug/drink book. It's not moody or experiential like Burroughs or Bukowski...more like a pharmaceutical laundry list. Should have been a five page short story.Is this my generation of writers? Perhaps it's best if we just nuke ourselves."
3,Pretty toy but not durable,"My daughter received this toy for her birthday and she just loves the Bratz dolls. We were very disappointed in this cafe though. It has realistic looking food and decorative cafe features but the stool tops don't stay on which don't allow the dolls to sit on them. Also, the items included easily fall over. Bratz items are also VERY difficult to remove from the packages and are taped and tied to the extreme! Luckily, we were able to return it, thanks to TOYS R US and get something else even though the package looked like a dog ate it."
2,good item but awful service,"The postcard was bent, scratched, and had smudges all over the back of it yet they took enough care to send it in bubble wrap mail. I don't think I will ever order from these guys again."
2,Sooo Good yet Soooo Baaadd,"This movie needs a soundtrack. This movie has some great catchy toons on it such as ""tokyo convertible"", ""why do you want more"" and ""let's roll"" but the the downside about this movie is... that it is just plain stupid!!!! Heres a lead. A guy with an electric guitar which has an drill attached to the end, and goes around singing and dancing and killing all at the same time. If you can figure out why please e-mail me. With an ending which is more confusing than a labyrinth. But this movie is not supposed to be picked judged on plot, or plausibility, it is supposed to be just for fun, and it does entertain although i am not sure it's intention was to make us laugh. Crystal Bernard's debut... I am not saying anything"
3,slumber party bomb,"This sequel to slumber party goes way down hill from the first film. There is continuation of the story however. Courtney (the little sister from the first part) is now in high school. Her sister Valerie, after escaping alive her experience with the serial killer years before, is now in a mental instituion.Courtney, who in the first film is a young adolescent girl who wants to crash the slumber pary and enjoys looking at playgirl magazine, is now a more grown up and sophisticated girl, however plagued by horrible and constant nightmares. Her and her rockband friends go away for the weekend to a new condo of one of the girls parents.There is not a lot of action for most of the film, and later you see the killer, who has come to life from Courtney's dreams, singing and dancing Rock n' Roll and smoking cigarrettes as he kills with his guitar/drill. The movie has a surprise ending which will probably disappoint more than anything else,"
4,"Different from the first, but frankly I liked it","It was not the same as the first movie. The girl has hallucinations and the end is basically opened. Whether she was all the time in the hospital, or she was on Slumber massacre, is the question. I must say the maniac that was in the movie was done pretty cool. Actually it was more fun to look at him and how he moved singing. Even his electro-guitar and outfit was done in a cool way. Despite the basic action happening in the last 22 minutes of the movie, it was rather fun than scary to watch. I liked the movie."
2,Yawn!,"Bad horror movies have a certain charm all their own, as do T&A movies (the two commonly go hand-in-hand). Either way, you won't find what you're looking for here. This film doesn't manage to pull off that magic 'cheese factor' that can make a bad horror movie good, and just ends up falling flat. I'll give it an extra star for a few clever bits, and Crystal Bernard fans might get a kick out of seeing her in an EARLY role, but that's about it."
2,Huh??,"This movie was clearly conceived while heavily medicated. The story was silly at best, only out done by the acting and costume choices.OK.. so we know story is not key to a rock-n-roll dream killer, B-movie. It is the gore, suspense, and lovely ladies. So how did it do on these fronts?For gore, the movie did OK. It is part of the driller killer series, so most of the action takes place as the rotating spear comes crashing through people's chests.Suspense... come on... he is a rock-n-roll guy with a drill on his guitar.The ladies... While they are certainly mostly cute, I don't think it was quite enough to make the movie a repeat watch."
3,an ode to Dr. Caligari,"I have to admit when I first saw this movie back in high school I hated it, but it grew on me after repeated viewings and have to say it's now one of my favorites. The cast is fun, the gore is ultra gooey and thought the story doesn't adhere much to reality, it does lend itself to being warped along the lines of Dr. Caligari... is this all real, or just Courtney's illusion? I also enjoyed it being a true sequel, picking up with the same characters from Part 1. It's cheesy, but fun and even has a couple good thrills throughout."
5,Hilarious!,"I really like this movie! I know it's not scary but it sure is funny and that's why i like it. My favorite thing about it is when the killer keeps saying ""Don't go all the way.""People don't need to take this movie so seriously. Just laugh and have a good time. If you want a scary movie try something else."
1,0 STARS: This filth is an insult to the horror genre.,"Is it possible to give a movie NEGATIVE stars? If it was, this garbage would get a lot of them. ""Slumber Party Massacre 2"" is an insult to the horror film genre and an insult to the serious horror movie fan's intelligence. I mean, a rock & roll singer dancing all over the place killing people with a ridiculous contraption that is half drill and half guitar???? Need I even say more???? If you like this movie, you may want to seek professional help."
1,"Nice collectible, but...","The Superfast cars are a very nice collectible. They are painted to specifications of the actual car manufacturers and have very nice detail. Unfortunately, despite the fact that the description (at the time of this review) says, ""This is a one time opportunity to get a case of ""IRREGULAR"" run colors of the Honda Element."" You WILL NOT get a case of the cars. You will get ONLY ONE. I was not disappointed by the car... just what I received."
1,$25 AN AMAZING PRICE FOR THIS RARE TOY,"Many of these toys originally sold for between $3 and $5, but it is unbelievably hard to get and rising in value. Here it is at an amazing $24.99! And to top it off, you can pay for a mere 12 pounds of shipping costs, which is far less than the cost of a brand new Element at your local Honda dealer. Keep in mind that this is not a toy for children, due to small parts. Also keep in mind that you are receiving a total of one car, and will not be burdened with multiple redundant copies at this unusually distinctive price. These Superfast series cars are stunningly attractive, and at $24.99 this is one of the most memorable purchases you will ever make."
3,Such a deal!!,"You won't want to wait to spring for $25.00 for this one car! Normally you would expect to pay $25.00 for a whole case of these cars, but you get a ""special"" deal here. Imagine only having to pay $14 plus dollars to get this one car in a very sturdy 11 pound box. Huury and get yours today before they run out!"
4,nice work shirt,"Nice work shirt, but be aware this is VERY heavy material for a T-shirt. Probably not good for summer. I like the fit and expect the heavy material will wear well."
2,Neck too short,The t-short is very tight at the neck. It almost feels like being choked. The fabric is good though. Returning it.
2,Bait and Switch!,"I was very disappointed when I received this shipment! I ordered 5 of these shirts and only 2 of them were the Heavy Weight T-Shirts I have come to expect from Riggs Workwear. The other 3 were light weight flimsy versions of the same shirt! I really hate it when manufacturesof a quality product go cheap, I would much rather them raise their prices to maintain their established level of quality. Most people I know don't mind paying a premium for quality if they get what they expect."
2,Not as they used to be.,"The fabric is not as heavy (7 oz.) as in previous purchases. Also, not as full cut. T-shirts seem more flimsy. Will not purchase again."
3,Very long T-shirt,"I originally bought these for my dad. When they arrived, I looked at them and they were extremely long. My dad would have never worn them. My husband is taller, so he kept them for himself, and we bought my dad another gift. The quality is good, but the length was totally unexpected. I'm glad I didn't have them delivered directly to my dad."
3,Nice design but breaks easly,"These sunglasses have a nice design and offer good protection. Unfortunately, I had a problem with the frame. The material used breaks easily."
5,Midsomer Murders - Set Four,"I LOVE all of the Midsome Murders series !!!The filming is spectacular, the storylines have lots of twists and turns, I can watch them over and over again !!Highly recommended !!!"
4,Always Good,I enjoyed Midsomer Murders when it was on TV and enjoyed finding so many more then I knew about. I suggest anyone who likes this show to get all the volumes.
4,Good Quality,"Met most expectations...had hoped that key lock flat pin would be more sturdy...same type twisted on my old National Hardware lock system. It's fine in warm weather, but in cold weather like we get in N. Idaho...it has a hard time releasing a cold lock without twisting. This defeats the ability to unlock the door with a key."
3,A great alternative,My girlfriend's motorcycle needed the primary resealed and there are no more new gaskets available that we could find. So was able to make one out of this material. Suggestion use an Excato Knife not a box cutter.
5,Get fit with Sqedunk,"Children of all ages will love this exercise video!Join Sqedunk, Athletic Anna, Miss Lori and theirexercise buddies in learning 14 basic exercises.Athletic Anna will lead each exercise with aninstruction on the proper way to do the exercise.Sqedunk and the rest of the group join Athletic Annain sets of each one of the exercises.After the 14 exercises are done, the home audience will get a bonus of the silly, exercise routine Athletic Anna performs in the Traveling ""Miss Lori Live"" Show. The routine gets faster as all try and keep up with Miss Lori singing the song:John Jacob Jingle Hiemer SchmidtRhymes, Silliness, Music, and a bit of energy make for a fun timeas well as teaching children the basics in exercising and staying fit.Children today need some extra encouragement in learningthe life-long skill of staying healthy and fit."
3,"3.5 Stars, a masterpiece in it's own right","I'd rate this a 3.5. Caleche EDP is very elegant and feminine. A true woody chypre. It is a classic sort of fragrance with a slight edge. My first impression of Caleche on my skin, was that it reminded me of wine. Caleche is a full-bodied & velvety Italian wine, with juicy tannins framing a balanced acidity. Caleche EDP I save for special occasions when I want to feel classy & sophisicated. It's not a scent I would want to wear everyday, nor, is it a scent that is ""me"", but it is a masterpiece in it's own right."
5,Latest 4Him offering,"I am very familiar with 4Him's music and style and like all their offerings to date, with OBVIOUS and FACE THE NATION ranking at the top of my personal list. I knew WALK ON would be good but expected it to be very like their ""old"" stuff. I was wrong--they've got a great new sound with a lot of ear interest. It's a new direction for them, and just when I thought I knew what to expect I've gotten a terrific surprise. It will be interesting to see what they do with their NEXT CD. They are not just resting on their laurels doing the same old same old."
5,"The house of the ""it was an accident"" tale.","It has been dropped 2 times from the top of the dresser and still works, need I say more? Just in case, my 6 yr. old loves it and it looks adorable on her dresser, like a real purse. The picture doesn't do it justice. It is really beautiful. Oh, I almost forgot. It sounds very good, no like a toy radio."
1,"As happens frequently, the product ordered was not delivered","This product is _NOT_ what is advertised, at least by title. These are 250mg capsules, not 500mg, so you actually receive half of what you order and pay for."
3,Works after multiple applications,"When I first tried this on a DVD that was skipping a lot nothing noticeable happened. Second time, the DVD still skipped a lot. After the seventh time, the disk was skipping a lot less. Some scratches might have been too deep. So it will work, but it may take several applications for good results."
4,Better than other reviews will have you think,"I know that his prouct has been slammed by others, but I find that it really works well for me (saved my The Man in the Iron Mask dvd). I put a very sparing amount of the solution on the disk, turn the knob for about 20 seconds and always use the mini wiper (in an outward circular motion) to clean all the disks and I have never had a problem. I even got a couple of pretty well worn disks from Netflix that other cleaners prior would have left still unable to be viewed all the way thorugh and t hey have played well and clear after using Optifix. I suggest that if you are looking for a cleaner, you give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised by the results."
5,Memorex Optifix Plus CD/DVD/Game Repair Kit,"Exactly what I needed it was a replacement for another one I bought from Amazon, but lost. GREAT, FABULOUS, WONDERFUL; B.S."
4,Don't know what every body is complaining about,This product has worked on every CD/DVD I've used it on. It's a bit clunky but works great for me. I've used it on CDs and DVDs and it doesn't leave swirly scratches like I've read in some reviews - this could be due to poor quality CD/DVDs. The only complaint I have is it didn't come with much repair solution and I had to buy some soon after I bought it.
1,Horrible piece of junk - ZERO STARS!!!,"I have a scratched game that I tried to save. After 30 minutes of pure hell trying to use this piece of crap, I have given up on it.The ""handle"" that you use to spin is .25"" inches tall, meaning you can only grip it with your fingertips- it is excruciatingly painful to attempt to use. The handle pops below the spinning mechanism everytime I try to spin it, rendering it unusable. To add insult to injury, I can also see the DVD spinning around in the machine while I am trying to use it- only a small portion of it is being touched!I have never written a bad review before. My experience with this was so horrible, I feel it is my duty to steer humanity away from it. This has forever ruined the Memorex brand for me. If they allowed this piece of junk out the door, I cannot trust them on anything else."
1,Do Not Waste your money,"I got the products because my son's movies had minor scratches, this did NOT do anything not even cleaned the disc's!"
1,Absolutely horrible,"This will not take any scratches big or small off of discs. Also it does not come with instructions, evidence the company knows it doesn't do anything.DO NOT BUY"
4,Fix-It Fine,"Some customers have grand expectations I think. I have an autistic 7 year old, so mine are not that high. Minor scratches can be fixed. Gouges or canyons created by misuse cannot, no matter the price of the unit!"
5,Ending can be the new begining,"Although she ended her abused childhood, Jennifer couldn't prevent the abuse from following her into her adulthood. Which is what many people face everyday in their own lives. Pamela Dasgupta's depiction of the characters, neither heroic nor demonic, yet each individual emerging naturally from his or her own experiences embedded in the respective lifestyle only he or she can define what led him or her to be there. May those who need to make that ending to begin that new life find the strength and courage to do so, remembering that tender touch is truly attainable and is more than a title of her novel."
5,Awesome evolution of a death metal band,"The Gathering in their newest album sleepy Buildings has proove once more why they are one of the most influential bands in this days , after ""souvenirs"" were they eliminated almost completely the heaviness to develop a sound more like ""massive attack"" they offered to us semiacustic versions of their best songs even that songs from their death metal period, to transform these songs in new harmonies with a whole new structure and perspective and progresive sound in many of these tracks, the musical concept this Deutch band owns now is very interesting and fascinating , experimentation is present in every one of the last three albums they have released and hopefully they will continue in search of new sounds and amazing songs to offer to usHM"
1,This group was done 5 years ago.,"Like most of the shleps who still fall for this group, I believe they were done as a creative force 5 years ago. Nighttime Birds was the last decent album they did, everything after that was pure trash, including this piece of junk, which, by the way, I wasn't stupid enough to buy, just sample. Hate me if you will, you European jam-lovers, but WHO CARES???"
4,Pretty Good Game~,"This is a pretty good game, if you like war and helicopters, you will love it. If you are unsure between a couple of flying games I also have Ace Combat 4, and Top Gun. Stay away from Top Gun, Ace Combat is so much better than Top Gun. But if you want the a little helicopter fun, Thunderstrike will take care of it."
1,Don;t buy this game,"The game is horrible. The graphics are terrible, it's hard to navigate the chopper and when you do get the hang of it good luck passing a mission."
4,Early Review,"I just bought this a few days ago, so it's too early to tell if it helps my back. The main reason I wanted to post is to clarify the angle. The literature for this chair variously says 45 deg and 70 deg. My question to the manufacturer was answered with more of the same literature. Now that I own it (and a level bar app on my handy dandy iphone), I can confidently say that this chair reclines to negative 30 degrees. Said another way, it reclines to 120 degrees from the sitting upright position. If I removed the foam pad and let steel clank on steel, I could probably get a few more degrees out of it.The seat belt is chintzy. I like supporting my weight using the belt, so I will probably try to find something more confidence inspiring.I do like the construction of the rest of the chair - and I like the chair position.So far I'm finding that 30 deg gives me plenty of gravity to feel a stretch, so I'm giving it 4 stars."
4,Great Chair!!,"Delivery was quick, just a few days. (Thank you Amazon), assembly was pretty quick, husband was able to get it together in about an hour. Very sturdy, built well. After figuring out how to get into and out of the chair without tipping back, it's a breezy to operate. After just a few short days of using the chair for about 8-10 minutes a day, I can feel a difference in my lower back. I love that I can go sit in this chair when I have pain and don't have to depend on a Chiropractor for a quick adjustment.I like it and it's working for me."
4,relief for back and neck pain,"I bought this after talking to my Neurologist for my neck problem. I also have bulged disc in 3 places. I was thinking about getting Inversion Table but when I saw Inversion Chair I like the idea of sitting down. I did some research and I liked this the best even though it is little more expensive than the others. It was very easy to put together (I did it in 30 minutes by myself). The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that for short people like myself (5' 3"") my butt does not go all the way back if I use the ankle bar. I started out using it for 5 min. a day and it does relieve the pressure on my neck and back. I would would highly recommend this to anyone who has back and neck problem but be sure to talk to your doctor."
5,One of the best of the era,"Old school metal at it's best. Personally this is my favorite of Savatage's albums. It retains a raw, slightly less-produced feel which I prefer, while laying down a ton of great guitar riffs. And of course, Jon Oliva's vocals are completely unique. This was Savatage at the height of their powers -- young, hungry to prove Fight for the Rock wasn't the end, and quite capable of laying waste to your ears and your parents' nerves. If you missed this one, or just misplaced your copy, pick it up."
1,Life's too short --don't waste one minute reading this tripe,"Just what the world needs -- more propaganda from a professional politican. What makes this even worse than one might imagine is that it glorifies terrorists and tries to rationalize their heinous acts. By the way, it's also pretty dull and unimaginative. The scariest part of the book is the fact that the author is actually a member of the United States Congress. And we wonder why society seems amoral -- just look to its leaders."
5,Candace Asher-A Well Needed Place in Our Musical World,"Candace is more than an artist who dares to touch the very contours of the listener's heart. Strong,compelling, yet oh so gently going places in our past, present, and yes even the future. Her lyrics are optimistic and her lessons are clearly defining today's ""survivors"" and the enormous amount of love and healing it takes to be one. This project is indeed a ""musical miracle"" for all to embrace with the same amount of passion the album itself possesses."
1,Poor Service,"I wonder why my review and complaint keep getting lost? Amazon perhaps the poor Customer Service complaint? Hmmm. Well I was extremely unhappy with how this company sends me the wrong size then wants me to pay seven dollars to exchange the item and states ""UPS won't ship free"" your mistake should'nt you waive the cost. Amazon was promptly told about it and also did nothing to help. Poor company be wary of their hidden cost policy for return. I had to keep them because I refuse to pay forty dollars for lingiere which would have been the cost with the return factored in. Other reputable companies will waive the fees.Needless to say my wife was very disappointed in the service or should I say lack of it this company provides. Save your money take your wife or girlfriend to a reputable store."
1,"Maybe I just got unlucky, but...","...I bought this item for $20, and it lasted all of about five hours before the snap broke, seemingly of its own accord. I wouldn't buy from them again."
5,Dodge Dakota Fog lights by Pilot,"Hello there, 98 Dakota Sport. At first the brackets did not look like they would work. There is a large Steel 90 bracket you won't use. The brackets included will clip to the factory bumper support and mounting is very simple!! These things are very bright and make my headlights look yellow. Super deal and about 1hr to install.ThanksJames H"
3,"Good Product, Not Quite A Good Fit","The lights seem to be good quality and are far better than the OEM fog lights. The mounting kit provided was nearly useless; count on coming up with your own mounting HW and doing quite a bit of drilling. If you are looking for a bolt-in product, this is not it. The only thing that was right was that the lights were the right diameter for the holes in the bumper. This might not be a problem on a newer vehicle, but mine (2001) was on the list of year models the kit was supposed to fit. (97-04) I would pretty much guarantee any older vehicle (97-00) would have the same problem."
1,Very poor quality,This DVD is the worst possible quality that I have ever seen or purchased. The music skipped and the picture was always jumping. I feel the price of $19.99 plus shipping is an absolute ripoff. I will never order another DVD from here again. If I could have given it a half star I would have.
4,Not too bad,"Considering it is impossible to find this movie anywhere and the fact that it has not been re-mastered, this version is not that bad. No off sync on the sound. The colors are a little faded, but watchable. The bad reviewers must have received defective discs. Hey, until Hollywood wakes up, I will happily watch this version. Mario Lanza's voice is exceptional."
2,"good music (voice of Mario Lanza), good location (Heidelberg","The movie provides good entertainment, good music, good location and simple story. The acting is also good. For music lovers (old music), this will really be enjoyable."
4,Pleased with their nostalgic past,"I bought this DVD for my parents as they saw this film on their honeymoon 56 years ago. They were pleased with the quality. The only thing they would have liked to have known was when it was filmed and released. Thanks!The Student Prince (Import, All Regions)"
3,A Moderatly good film,"I have watched a good deal of musicals and this does not rank up at the top, the songs are fairly good, (some of them are a little tedious.) The Movie is a little long and so the whole thing gets a little tedious. I Like Anne Blyth a lot and she plays exeptionally well in this film and yet this film lacks something. It Lacks the makings of a really great musical, as musicals (normaly) should be shorter and less heavy and serious.But this Film is not a bad one and if you are a fan of Operettas this is probably a good one for you."
1,Don't waste your time,"My wife got this on a recommendation from a friend. I couldn't stay awake it was so boring. She even was mystified at the recommendation. Lousy ending (so I'm told --like I said, I didn't make it past about 15min)."
1,No Subtitles,"What a ridiculous price, I suppose nobody will be buying it for this price. And ofcourse again NO SUBTITLES, I hope people stop buying DVD's from the Warner Archive series so that Warner will stopoffering them without subtitles.And for both reasons I give only 1 star. The film itself would be getting 5 stars from me when it had subtitles. I would have bought it then for sure. So, Warners if you want to sell more, release them eventually in other countries and be sure to give us subtitles. Or give us a normal SUBTITLED Mario Lanza boxset with these titles.Ad de Koning, Almere, Holland"
2,Lanza Was Right... the Directing is Terrible!,"This is the worst film to feature Lanza in any way. Lanza and the Director just couldn't get along and I can see why. The Director has poor Edmund walking his wooden way through this film while incongruously opening his mouth and emitting all of the unrestrained passion of Lanza's voice. Lanza wanted to play the Prince evolving from a disciplined Prussian into a passionate lover. The Director would not allow the metamorphosis. Lanza would have been great in this role, but he just couldn't tolerate what he thought (correctly, I believe) was the absurd juxtaposition of the sometimes sentimental other times pleading or romantic music/lyrics... with the Director's insistence that the lead be played almost devoid of emotion. It was Director vs. Mario and the result was that this is the film marks the beginning of the tragic end of Lanza's painfully brief career."
3,Below average,"The DVD was exactly as I remember the movie from the 50's. Delivery was excellent and price was reasonable. However, the quality of the movie was below that to which I have become accustomed. Additionally the movie track, both video and audio, did skip on three or four different occasions, for several seconds, but did correct itself and continue playing after each instance."
3,Remastered?,"Great movie-however, this is not ""remastered"" as advertised which is the only reason I bought it. Same old print used in the 20+ year old Laserdisc (which I have) with lots of speckles, tears/repairs, some fading, some loss of focus. Still, it looks OK. The movie really deserves remastering from the negative. The McDonald/Eddy movies have the same fate. Still highly enjoyable, the leads are very convincing, Ann Blyth's voice is a miracle, and Lanza is recorded very well. Lanza's tracks are in Mono (you'll hear it through headphones) as his tracks were probably made before stereo was used--the rest is in very good stereo."
2,Korean subtitles?,I had no idea there would be Korean subtitles especially covering almost a quarter of the screen but the movie is still a classic.
1,Tape was written over,"Unfortunately, the tape was not in the condition advertised. The box was in fair (not very good) shape and the tape had been written over. I did receive a fast response from the seller. I am waiting to see the credit on my account as promised by the seller. The seller will now be checking tapes to ensure that the ""tab"" was not removed, allowing a tape to be reused."
5,Subtitles ARE Removable,So glad to see that the subtitles are indeed removable in the currently available issues.The Student Prince (1954) (Import All Region)
4,A Tru Classic,"Having seen several versions of this classic on stage, including the USO production in Heidleberg, Germany, in 1968, I can easily recommend this video. Although some important scenes are either left out or just shown in passing, this video captures the spirit of Romberg's music quite well. The addition of ""I'll Walk With God"" seems to have been put in only to showcase Mario Lanza's talents; I think it is not a fitting adjunct to the accurate telling of Romberg's tale.I originally saw this film when it was new; I was 9 years old. My 11 year old sister and our Mother went along. After the show was over, my sister was perplexed. She asked Mother, ""Which one was Mary O'Lanza?"" We still laugh about that today!A good follow-up to this film would be ""Deep in My Heart,"" the Sigmund Romberg story, starring Jose Ferrar."
2,"Film good, DVD-R not","In few words: the film is superb: great art direction, great costumes, nice songs, a beautiful singing voice of Mario Lanza and a wonderful Cast like Edmund Purdom, Ann Blyth, Richard Anderson (Buck Falmont in Season 7 of ""Dynasty"") and the wonderful S. Z. ""Cuddles"" Sakall in his last movie!!!!The Picture quality: acceptable but not very good. Soundtrack is in 4-channel Stereo. Specially during the songs it sounds wonderful.Subtitles: noneThe biggest minus with this DVD-R: the movie stops in the 61th minutes and can't play the last part.In other words: i really have only rare times trouble with DVD's or Blu-Rays are its really cheapy and unfair of Warner Brothers to release to great movies on a cheapy way.Sorry WB, I don't buy anymore those DVD's"
2,Disappointed,I was sorry to see that we could not delete/erase the subtitles in Korean. The film is in wide screen and the subtitles at the bottom makes it even smaller on our screen. I am happy that they are translating this wonderful movie but would prefer to have it as an optional item.Jolene Sollivan
3,Now isnt that him???,"The first time I saw this movie ,someone told me that there is actually a scene in which Mario Lanza does indeed appear.... after about the third time, I think I found it....It is the scene in the cathedral after the King dies and the Prince is singing ""I'll walk with God"". Not the close up, mind you, but the very long wide angle shot. That said, regardless of why Lanza was fired or quit or got too fat(All stories that go around).This is a delightful old fashioned film. Edmund Purdom does an admirable job(especially of the dubbed songs)in a really tough turn.Ann Blyth is a perfect Kathy and the supporting cast is among the best.What a hoot to see Richard Anderson and John Ireland as the leaders of the rival corps. I dont suppose they could really sing either,but...An all around good time!"
3,Super Reader,"This book is set in the same universe as the others in the Lensman series, but it is only tangentially related. It references events that happen then, but it is completely Kinnison free.The hero of the piece is Neal Cloud, a scientist nicknamed Storm. His family are killed by what you could call a space tornado. He is a supergenius, and sets out to do some storm chasing and destroying, picking up a crew along the way."
3,Fair to middlin,"Possible the worst follow up ever to s pretty strong series, this had the feel of Spaceballs 2 the sequal: This time its about money...(Forgive me Mel Brooks for what was surely a misquote by me, though I think it gets the point across)This is more in the vein of how Larry Niven writes more books in his ""Know Space"" arena, that are only peripherally tied in by the place and timeline in which they take place. The difference being Niven creates unique and interesting characters for his different novels, and Doc missed the mark with this attempt. Unless you are a die hard who simply MUST read everything in a ""series"" once you start (like me) Feel free to skip this one over..."
5,Nice jewelry kit!,"This is a nice jewelry kit with all wooden beads. My 5-year old will work on making necklaces, bracelets, etc. for 20-30 minutes at a time. The bead stringing is great for fine-motor skills. My only complaint is that some of the beads are not drilled through completely and end up getting thrown away."
4,Nice,"These beads look very well made. The kit is smaller than I expected it to be, but still nice. The only complaint I have about them is the dye comes off easily when the beads get wet. It doesn't leave the bead any less colored, but it does leave color on what ever the bead(s) were laying on. All in all satisfied with the product though. My daughter certainly loved it!"
5,Simply Amazing!!,"I honestly can't put into words how amazing this show is!! As a foster parent, it provided a lot of insight into the world of foster care and adoption beyond what I already knew. The actors and actresses in this show are simply incredible! Not well known, but I am now a huge fan! The background music in the show is phenomenal! I must have bought most of the tracks on iTunes because now when my iPod is on shuffle, I'm always hearing music from this show, and it always make me smile! I'm not one the gush about tv shows (don't really even watch a lot of tv) but this show was really something special! I think that it is an absolute travesty that the show was cancelled after only two seasons! So glad I bought the series on DVD! Although I've watched the entire series, I'll be watching all over again soon! You should too! You won't be disappointed!"
3,water-works,"This show is fun to watch - and is merely a ""polished"" soap opera, imo. However, the amount of water-works (crying) seems to reach new highs w each subsequent episode. And, some of the characters are a bit hard to believe. For example, most of the responses of the character ""Ryan"" don't seem ""understanding"" or ""insecure"" - they seem so beyond effeminate as to make it difficult to imagine this character wanting to marry someone of the opposite sex. But, other characters do seem somewhat ""real"" and the story line is interesting."
5,dvd purchase,the dvd set that i purchased was exactly what it was described as. it was brand new never opened and i received it promptly. i will definately purchase from amazon again.
5,Love this show!,"I started watching this show when the pilot aired on the CW, and have stuck with it ever since. I recently ordered seasons 1 & 2 on DVD and I'm loving having it on hand whenever I feel like watching it! This show really brings you into the characters world, you feel like you're sitting with them in their living room. Life Unexpected has the same essence as The Gilmore Girls did. Go ahead and give it a try! You will not regret it, I promise."
5,loved life unexpected!,"I also can't believed CW cancelled Life Unexpected! I couldn't wait to watch every week, loved the characters and story lines. There is not another show on TV like it. I thought The CW was better than that, its the ony station I watch when new shows come out in the fall. I quit waching the major stations as they cancel the the new shows to soon, and I'm already hooked! ABC is for sure quilty of that prank."
2,not a proheat,"I bought this and it did not have the power needed to do the job. I took it off and put a Proheat on and it worked excellent, much easier to put on also. Just peel and stick. I would not recommend the Kats heater for even marginal cold weather. I do recommend the Proheat as it did a great job on my truck down to -35F"
1,battery hater mat,I would have to rate the item poor. I was only able to use it once. It overheated and shorted out. The weight of a battery was too much foor it. It was lucky that there wasn't any fire from using it. I would not recomend this style any one. I ended up purchasing a wrap around style and it seem to work fine with no over heating.
3,interesting and often insightful but...,"Wink writes from a perspective that takes what would almost have to be considered a liberal approach to the gospel. Although there are defintely moments when his scholarship and spirit shines, it must be kept in mind that he is writing from a world view that sometimes implies that the disciples may have misunderstood Jesus's message. His view of the Powers as mere spirits of organizations and his denial of their independent conscious existence is not convincing. Liberal Christians who do not consider the Bible the literal word of God will have a much easier time dealing with this Carl Jung inspired rendition of Christianity than those with more fundamental leanings."
5,Goodhope-A Journey Through Life,"Through laughter and tears, Goodhope takes readers on a journey experiencing a learning process of ""life."" Although this book focuses on the grieving process, it also allows individuals to put his/her marriage into prospective and see the things that are so often taken for granted. Goodhope is a reality check, reminding readers how precious and treasured each moment should be when with their significant other."
1,depressing old fashoined advise,Compared to another book which focused on healing back pain naturally this book was not helpful. Instead of focusing positive on total health and recovery it tells you how to deal with the pain. I didnt want to deal with the pain I wanted to get better. This book was not good.
3,A book about a movie about a book,"This is a powerful and moving story, however it loses it's power over several retellings. Donald woods orginal book may prove a better read bit i can't find a copy."
3,You get what you pay for.,"Yes it's cotton and has a real embroidered patch and gold cord.The peak just does not seem right, it's to big and points down.I had to remove the gold cord and re-center it.The picture shows the cap in an upward angle, imagine it sitting level, the peak would cover your eyes.It's usable, could have been real nicel, but poorly designed."
4,this is so cool hat,this hat is made so-so not a ever day hat but it fit me good that is one thing i like about it
1,Not Adjustable as Advertised,"I bought this as a joke to wear on my old beat up 17 foot boat... it came, but it is not adjustable like they advertised it is, and it does NOT look like the hat in the picture. I will be returning it and demanding a refund."
2,This is a good hat but,"It wasnt a snap back, just lk a medium. Wish it woulda been a snap back, and this was the second time i ordered this hat from the company the first time they sent me the wrong size."
3,Wrong Item,"They sent me the wrong cap, I ordered the adjustable cap and got one that you can't adjust. Also there are loose threads everwhere looks like it was sewn together very fast. Last they shipped it in a box that was too small so now my cap is in an oblong shape that doesn't conform to my head."
3,Yacht Hat,"I bought this hat as a gift for my husband. We bought a newer bigger boat & it was a little joke (Captain of the ship). The joke was on me when I received it. Althought it was inside a plastic bag, there was a small stain that looked like a drop of oil. I have done my best to remove it but it is still there. If was a real expensive item, I may be more upset than I am."
1,Don't buy from the The Movie-Guy-BookGuru!,Ordered item and never received it or got a response from the seller when made inquiry into status. Later found others had the same experience even though his rating was high. I definitely do not recommend this seller.
5,Edelbrock Intake Manifold,"No problems at all with the product, however I paid a considerably higher amount for Overnight shipping, on a Thursday afternoon, (before 3:00PM) and the shipper sent it Standard Ground. It showed up the following Monday, at 5:30PM. I could have really used that $40.00, and put it towards something else. I hate getting ripped off. The seller could have offered me a bit of my money back, but instead they kept it."
5,"Great manifold at a great price, received as expected.","I bought this to replace a manifold that the thermostat housing bolts had sheared off on and this was a perfect replacement. No problems installing it and all of the necessary installation instructions are provided, including the torque sequence and specifications. The price is very competitive on Amazon. Most other places were $30 or $40 higher and didn't offer free shipping. I'm very pleased with the purchase."
2,Slow Shipper,"The product was as described, however I ended up with 2 0f the same thing as I needed it sooner. All I received from seller is a sorry we screwed up. Somewhere along the line when you take a month to ship something you should at least refund the shipping. JMO"
4,A very good coverage,"This was the first book that introduced me to all the details of the parchments and texts on which modern Bibles are based. It is full of fascinating detail about the books and parchments. It is easy to read, in my humble opinion.I know that an awful lot more of information has become available since it was published and I keep looking for a fourth edition, but alas no.Desmond O'Toole"
1,Not right for my situation,"I wasn't happy with this purchase at all. My son is slow to speak but he's as smart as they come and I know it's just a matter of time. He's signing and his expressive and receptive communication is excellent. He's not quite 22 months old.I wanted a book to help me encourage his talking, so I can be his speech therapist as well as his mom. This book seems to be for someone who has a child with a diagnosed (or soon to be diagnosed) speech problem. There is only one chapter on actually helping them talk yourself."
3,Get Diagnosed FIRST,"This book is about APRAXIA (not regular speech delays) and is only helpful if your child has apraxia. However, it is NOT helpful in diagnosing apraxia, despite it attempts. I bought this book because my son was late in talking and I determined from the book that he did NOT have apraxia (which rendered the book minimally helpful). Later, he was diagnosed with apraxia! The book is written by a parent whose understanding of apraxia seems to come mostly from her own experience. Not all kids with apraxia exhibit the traits of her child. Mine doesn't.If your child does have apraxia, this book is a great starting point as it covers a lot of different topics related to apraxia and is practical and simply written. It's a bit hyped and emotional (implying that one wrong turn could permanently ruin your child's success) but I do agree that it is important to seek out the best therapy for your child as she has obviously done.It's worth the read, IF your child has apraxia."
3,Strengths and Weaknesses,"This book has strengths and weaknesses. A great strength is the information about possible causes of speech delay, descriptions of speech therapy techniques, and tasks parents can do to help. I have had a hard time finding this detailed information in other sources. The weakness of the book is that the ""Forward"" and first few chapters contain unsubstantiated arguments for getting early intervention. As a parent and critical reader, I'm disappointed with the appeals to fear, slippery slope fallacies, lack of discussion and citing of evidence, and weak refutations and poor analysis of objections. I recommend that parents read this book along with other books about the subject in order to make educated decisions about late-talking children."
2,Subtitle is should be What to Do if Your Child has Apraxia!,"This book is an excellent resource if you suspect your child might have apraxia. But its subtitle, ""What to Do If Your Child Isn't Talking Yet"" is misleading, since it implies that the variety of possible speech and language disorders will be addressed. Instead, 95% of the book is devoted to apraxia, a very specific disorder, with perhaps 5% relating to other speech disorders. Language disorders as such are barely touched upon.It's a fascinating book full of helpful information, certainly, and interesting in its own right. But for me, the mother of a child with a language disorder, it was $14 dollars largely wasted.For the next edition, the publishers should be encouraged to change the subtitle and give a clearer description of the book's subject on the back cover."
4,Great resource for parents of Apraxic children!,"I bought this book because my 2.5 year old son was diagnosed with Apraxia (Dyspraxia) of Speech a few months ago. This book contains valuable information on therapy techniques you can use at home, the types of therapies you should be seeking out for your child and information on how to deal with insurance coverage. It also talks about the importance of early intervention when your child has a speech disorder and the specific language and wording to use when describing your child's problem to professionals.This book is geared mainly towards Apraxia, not necessarily normal speech delays or articulation problems, so the title is a bit misleading. I would highly recommend having this book as a resource if your child has Apraxia."
3,Title is misleading,"This is a good book, well written and very informative. However, the title is misleading, as 90% of it is information about/for apraxia. If your child is apraxic, this book is for you. If you're looking for a general book on parents at-home techniques for stimulating speech, there is only one short chapter in this book. This book also has no information about speech disorders other than apraxia. I got Patricia Hamaguchi's book, Childhood Speech, Language, and Listening Problems: What Every Parent Should Know, out from the library, and am reading it, and it has fantastic overview info about all kinds of speech delays and disorders. IT is an old book, 1995, so there may be new research since then."
1,Didn't like this book,"Bought four books after the pediatrician diagnosed our son as a ""late talker"". This book left me in tears. It's horrible, and frankly, I have a background working with children who have autism, specifically the non-verbal. The author spouts quite a bit of say so, with no documentation to mention. Take the advice from this mother, grandmother, father and grandfather....buy THE EINSTEIN SYNDROME by Thomas Sowell....even if your child is autistic, or developmentally challenged, you'll feel better about the diagnosis, and empowered to make the proper choices for your child and family."
5,Can't recommend high enough,"I was so tired of hearing my son was just a late talker. I wasn't worried, but I had questions and wanted to know what I could do to help my child. Why is he not talking yet? Does he need therapy? As a father I absolutely loved this book. It's cram packed with information on how to work with my son to help him. The chapters are broken down by topic ie: therapy, things to do at home to help, etc.Simply put this is a must read for any parent of a child who has a speech problem. Best book and only book I've found so far that gives specifics on how and why your child may have a speech delay from an easy to understand parent/professional point of view."
2,Why you should see a speech therapist.,"The first half of this book explains why children who are late talkers should be rushed to a speech therapist, complete with all the research to support why you should ""run not walk"" to a speech therapist.The second half of the book gives parents some useful ideas for helping a late-talker, particularly if the child has apraxia. Mine doesn't. Luckily for me, I got the book from the library, so at least I didn't feel the disappointment of having wasted money."
1,Doesn't Address Autism as a Possible Cause,"Long after reading this book, I found out that my son has autism, and this was the source of his delayed language. This book does not even address the possibility of a language delay being due to autism, and I find this inexcusable. If I had known back then that autism is a major cause of speech delay, I might have gotten him diagnosed earlier and therefore treated earlier.The book focuses on apraxia way too much, since the author happens to have a child with apraxia."
5,Granddaughter with Apraxia,"THANK YOU Dr. Marilyn C. Agin, M.D., Lisa F. Geng, and Malcolm J. Nicholl and Paula Tallal, Ph.D who wrote the forward.This book is a must for anyone who believes that a child ""should be talking,""... even though people around you say, ""She'll catch up, she's just a late talker..."" The introduction says, trust your instincts and intuitions.Everything you need to know is condensed in a wonderful, easy to read format...If you are reading this review your instincts and intuitions are working for you.THIS IS THE BOOK YOU NEED TO READ FIRST and THEN YOU NEED TO ACT."
1,LOUD,Extremely loud inspite of what is advertised. Same old unimproved 10-15 yr old technology. I wanted more quite and ordered the item to get that. I got a SCREAMING whistling jet engine. I cannot recommend this product.
2,"incomplete, often incorrect transcriptions","This book will give you the basic outlines of Doc's tunes, but if you are hoping for help figuring out the more complicated sections of some of his songs, this book won't help you. Many of the transcriptions are incomplete or simply incorrect."
5,This Man is a National Treasure!,"This is a wonderful book of Doc's songs. Like any book its not gonna give you note for note transcriptions, thats ridiculous. It lays out the basics for you to dive right in and start playing along. If you need detailed note for note transcriptions look elsewhere, thats not the point of any music book. What makes this book exceptional is that Doc tells you a bit about every song and who taught it to him, like a little bio and it is so special to hear his words. Plenty of absolutely GREAT black and white pictures with every song, a very nice feature. Overall a great book by a great artist. There aint too many like him left people so take notice."
2,missing pages,"Not totally happy about it -- pages 19 & 20 are missing! I could see where a dealer might miss this-- but not an owner /seller.The song was one I wanted to learn-- ""Froggy Went A-Courtin"".I'll still get some use out of it."
3,"Not ""edge of your seat"" but not bad","Here's another one of those movies about a guy getting out of prison, then having the cops put wires on him to go undercover to try to bust some bigger fish. That guy is played by Jim Belushi. He does a decent job, just like he always does. This type of movie has been done many times before, so it's nothing that really stands out. It does have a great supporting cast, though, such as Henry Silva, who, of course is the head of the whole drug thing. Henry Silva always does good at this type of charactor and at was good seeing him here after not really seeing much of him since Above The Law. Others include Charles Durning and Tony Plana. You can get this cd in the discounted section of certain big stores and it's worth the money if you find it at a place like that. It may not be worth a full dvd price though."
4,great cards,"i came by this deck from a friend who had used it on me. the card that i picked that day was right on target with it's message. some time later, i decided to buy a deck for myself as it is hard to find a deck or any spiritual tool that is accurate.i've had these cards for over a month now. i learned that this deck and other cards (tarot or oracle) are not meant to be used on a whim. drawing a card randomly will get you a ""does not apply"" card. i've tried it, so i know. however, you can pick a card to help you with your day, as sonia suggests in the booklet. it is best used if you have a situation that you need help with. that's when the cards have been the most accurate for me.as this deck is big, i found it easier to just shuffle the cards while thinking about my question/issue. my intuition, a feeling then guides me as to which card i need to draw.i look forward to using it in the future and i would recommend this to anyone."
5,Great cards,I love these Oracle Cards! I use them as a guide when I have completed readings with my Tarot Cards. It helps me to see the path in the future for the querent.
4,"uplifting, spiritually motivating",Sonia's messages are beautifully described in each card. Divinely written with love. It is relieving and inspiring to hear from your angels and guides through these cards.
5,Amazingly accurate,"This is a great deck of cards! The booklet offers a lot of amazing advice.And they are amazingly accurate. I found that the best way to use these cards, for me, is to ask 2 questions of the same subjects. Because when I ask ""should I do this?, it become very unclear to me. But when I ask for the answers of 2 opposite choices, the answers are pretty clear. For example, when I ask ""should I work?"" and ""Should I continue studying?"" The answers were exactly the opposite. And maybe it's not the cards can predict the future or what is best for you. But I think what they do is helping you get clearer about what you want in life. It's so hard to find out and concentrate on what you really want because we have millions of thoughts in our heads. I think using the cards is another way to get the message from your true self of what you really want. Try it! You won't regret!"
5,My Favorite Deck,I've owned this deck for close to a year and it's the deck I always pick up to do quick and straight to the point readings. The readings I receive when I use this deck are very accurate and resonate well with me and my beliefs.
3,"Good overall, better for beginning students","This is a good dictionary, consisting of over 70,000 translations, with an interesting game section in the middle to hone your skills. More geared towards the beginning Spanish person."
5,Excellent quick reference,This is an excellent book to add to your sewing library. It's easy to use and I love that it lays flat. I had stopped sewing for years and used this book to not only refresh my memory but learn about fabrics I've never used. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone just starting sewing and even those that have been sewing for years. There's always something to learn and this book puts everything about the fabrics discussed neatly and concisely.
1,About More Fabric Savvy,"More Fabric Savvy: A Quick Resource Guide to Selecting and Sewing FabricI was very happy with the price and physical quality of this product. The shipping and handling was reasonable for an expedited rate. However I'm disappointed in the quality of the material presented in the book. The photos are ridiculously outdated and information was extemely limited and vague. This was an average price reference guide but I feel as though it offered below average information. In this case I definitely DID NOT get what I paid for, I got far less."
4,Great Fabric Book But Missing Some Fabric Types,"This book is great in that it is organized well and discusses how to sew each fabric in two pages. However, I don't know everything about fabrics which is why I bought this book. Some fabrics are not mentioned in the book which confused me. Do they have other names for the fabrics??? For example, seersucker is not in there. Taffeta is in there but does not discuss the different types of taffeta and how they all look. That would have been nice too."
3,disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this book. She seems to adore silk and wool while not covering a lot of other fabrics. There are also some things missing that I wanted to know: washing instructions, how does the fabric wrinkle, is the fabric warm or cool, does the fabric breath or not, etc. Things someone who must order fabric on line needs to know. Some of this information was on some fabrics, but not all."
5,Excellent book for everyone who sews,"More Fabric Savvy: A Quick Resource Guide to Selecting and Sewing Fabric Completely Revised and UpdatedThis is a must have book for anyone who sews. If you are starting out, it will save you a lot of frustration, money and fabric/supplies. If you are more advanced or a serious seamstress, it will help you to know the answers to all the questions that come up when handling multiple types of textiles. Each page on a fabric gives you all the information you need to know about that fabric, including what needle to use, what pressure foot to sew with, whether to wash or dryclean, line, how to hem, etc.If I had this book when I was starting out over 30 years ago, I could have saved a lot of money. This is a great gift for someone who loves to sew."
4,This is a wonderful book with lots of historical tidbits,"This is really more of a history book, to my reading. It has wonderful little known facts that I would never have learned otherwise. There is a lot of research that went into this book, and she obviously worked long and hard to get this book and the history into order. This is a wonderful book for anyone who is interested in Poland or Slavic areas, and the recipies, to me, almost seemed as an afterthought, though I do not doubt they are correct and proper for Poland. Enjoy!!!"
1,don't like it,"personally, I think that this index has the most innacurate information available. It never has what most people need and it's too hard to use."
3,A weak end to a good series,"This is just a short warning for those interrested in this series. The series as a whole is excellent! For most of the series, I didn't want to put the book down... BUT. The end (second half of this book) was AWEFUL. Opening ""book 6"" was like starting a new story. It was as if the writer never read the previous ones! I had ignored the reviews that said to skip the second half of this and read on, hoping it would all turn out to be a dream, a test or something else... but sadly nothing happened to redeem the story. So, the short version - Read the first half of this book, skip the second."
1,Not Very Good CDs,"I burned a couple of good CDs off of this spindle when I first got it a few months ago, then I burned about 4 or 5 recently and they all skip every 10 seconds or so, on average. There are no scratches on the CDs, they just skip. I bought a different spindle today and they are fine so I have to conclude there is a problem with the CDs themselves."
4,Different Gaskets Needed,"The rubber seal included with this thermostat is too thick and will not allow it to fit into the recess in the housing. Also, another gasket is required that is not included, so you must buy an additional gasket set, which includes both the rubber seal and housing gasket to properly install this product. Fortunately, I had these parts, and after installing, everything worked great."
4,Let the Music Play (Collection),A good overall collection for someone to get introduced to Barry White. My recommendation - save your pennies and get the albums that the songs hail from. That is the only way to get a good dose of the maestro!!Four stars for the collection. I subtracted one star 'cause several of the songs are 'single' versions!!
4,very Good collection,"I've always dug Barry White. his Music was always something that I just dug. the smoothness&His grooves were unlike anybody else's. his Beats, Harmonys, Chords&Strings made music feel like it was floating. He also was Cold on the Mic. Barry White was street,but also had a Smoothness to the way he was presenting his songs. ""Can't get enough of you babe, Love Serenade,etc... all I need is some Barry White Music, a Bucket of KFC with some Kool-Aid&I can make a Lady feel like she is floating. Barry White was a Badd Musical Genius. those Strings alone with his trademark vocal presentation&the Brother made you laugh as well. Feel Good Raw Soul Music. very Versatile Soul Brother."
4,Solid Gold,"I think the world of Barry White, he my hero. So everything he makes I find a way too like it."
4,60's once more,"Bas.ket was a game I enjoyed a dreat deal as a kid. My dad and i payed for hours. I bought it for us at Christmas. It still has its appeal, and you can make up your own rules to play different ways. It doesn't strain the eyes since there is no computer screen. I still recommend this game as a number one in fun."
2,Cheap Reproduction of Classic Toy,"I too had this game back in the 60s and thought that it would be fun to play it again. Unfortunately, this is a cheaply made reproduction. It was hard to assemble, it is hard to score (impossible from the free throw line), and it is frustrating to play. We played it once or twice and have not played it again."
1,Where are the old days!?,"I purchased this game thinking that I would get the one that I had back 30 years ago. That basketball set was so fun all my friends used to skip high school and set up leagues to play for hours at a time. What a hoot! Who needed drugs, sex and rock and roll when you had this?I was sorely disappointed when I got the newer model with the plastic levers rather than the old steel ones. Can't hit a shot for nothing and I used to be the all-time leading scorer. It ruined what was going to be a great Christmas morning with my children. Now it has sat all year unused. What a waste. Sooooo Disapointed!"
1,Bas-Ket game review,"I had one of the original Bas-Ket games when I was a boy. I kept it for years and my sons played with it until one of them accidently stepped on the game surface and ruined it.Years later, I saw this on Amazon and ordered two of them. I gave one to my grandson for Christmas. My son told me a short while later that the game had already broken and was not nearly as good quality as the original because the flippers that ""throws"" the ball are now made of PLASTIC instead of metal.The makers of the modern game ruined one of the best games ever made by using cheap plastic instead of durable metal.I could not have been more disappointed. Companies don't seem to have pride in their products any more; the bottom line is all that matters."
4,An Adorable Halloween Tale,"My son, age 4, and I first picked out this book at our local library and it became an immediate favorite. The illustrations are adorable and the rhythmic verse is delightful. After reading aloud to my son over the course of several nights he memorized it! Now I am purchasing the book because he does not want to return his copy to the library. Now, my son gets great pleasure reading to his mommy and daddy. I must say we are brimming with pride ourselves. I even told my son's teacher- ""let him read the story to you!"""
4,Still a great TV,"We bought our tv in 2004. Had it shipped 300+ miles. It needed to be fixed once while covered by warranty, and the same problem less than a year later. The repair man fixed it mostly free of charge because he said maybe it was a bad part. Haven't had any other problems with it. In fact we've been patiently waiting for it to quit working so we can buy a flat screen tv!!"
5,Extermely beautiful gemstone and crystal cards.,"In the few months that I've been regularly using the Aora Gemstone Oracle cards, I've really enjoyed them. They're so easy and fun to use! Picking a card to find the crystal best for me each day is my favorite. Visually the Aora cards are the best tarot or card deck I've seen. Since getting the cards, my personal collection of stones and crystals has increased. I get lost in the images on these cards!!!!!!"
3,just ok,"I have many oracle card sets and this one is helpful and worthwhile, but I think that The Crystal Ally Cards by Naisha Ahsian are much stronger. The Crystal Ally Cards are deeper, easier to relate to, give more information and seem more applicable to everyday life. I like the AORA cards, but I do not reach for them frequently. I was a bit disappointed, but it is still a good deck."
1,Trend Blah-ing,"This book is chock full of glib prognostications like robots will be introduced to us within the next decade, the government will not control the Internet, and the awkwardly worded ""the end of privacy leads to us becoming a paranoid people."" Really? Yet Laermer doesn't mention anything about terrorism. He also doesn't mention that he didn't foresee the dot com bust. His PR business was made up mostly of Internet companies. When they went belly up, Laermer's busines dried up. Talk about not Trendspotting. And it raises an important question: Why should you believe a word of what this guy says?In his book Laermer implores us ""to think like the Jetsons."" I guess that makes sense: it was fiction, too."
1,Dejavu all over again,"If you have the sense you've read this book before, you have. a bad collection of pseudo predictions and collected maxims you've already seen in magazines and online. if this is what lermer is telling his clients they'll have a great view of what is right in front of their eyes. I want my money back; I guess I didnt see that in the future!"
2,"Much more a ""what"" book than a ""how"" one","I expect this book to tell me ""how"" to spot the trend. Instead, it keeps on telling me ""what"" (10 chapters out of 11) experts predicted on or before 2002. Today is 29th Jan 2005 and well it's natural for me to comment that it is quite outdated and irrelevant.In short, not recommended.p.s. To justify my rating of the book, below please find the ten ways (taglines) to be a better trendspotter from the last and only relevant chapter for your reference.1. Faddy Trends2. Note + Phone + Mail3. Books for the lover4. This web I am tangled in (websites)5. News or lose (newsletter)6. Grassroots trendspotting from our packed files (talk to experts who would be moved by your enthusiasm)7. Trade Ya! (trade and non-mainstream magazines)8. Pay attention to little guys (Alan Greenspan would track something as seemingly insignificant as the production and sale of packing paper)9. Information, please. (newspapers)10. Anything rhyme with Google?"
5,Future stuff!,"Where Faith Popcorn spots trends floating around in her own head, Laermer asked the people in the know, The book is littered with futuristic missives from more than 100 people in technology, spirituality, giving a real sense of what's to come and how to decide for yourself.TrendSpotting is a fun and fast read for anyone looking to spot trends for their business or own personal enjoyment."
3,"It is OK, but cheaply made.","I bought this costume for my 9 year old son. It arrived and I felt that it was cheaply made. It looks very much like the package, but the fabric is thin and the seams are not very secure."
4,Pretty good,The costume itself is nice. The arm and leg pieces are way too big so we left them off. The costume got the job done.
3,pretty good,"Overall Watson does a good job. His style can get carried away, though. It has been a while since I read this book, so I am fuzzy on the details. What I remember is the general impression that the author loves his subject but gets a little too excited about it at points and this leads to some hyperbolic claims. He has a book coming out called ""Jacobson's Organ""; it is about the sense of smell. I have read excerpts from it, and it is written in a similar fashion. More literary science than scientific literature."
5,"Works fine, costs less, what you'd expect more?","So far, this battery is doing extremly fine. Let's see how it will work in future."
1,Misleading,EGR 642421 WindowVisors Dark Smoke 4-Piece Window VisorsThis product was returned for the following reasons.1. Picture showed this product installed on a 4 door pick up when it was actually for a Quad cab.2. The front door parts were for the same door.
5,Stunning!,I just love it. It will look fabulous with my mother-of-the-bride dress and many other special occasion dresses.
2,Stylistics or grammar?,"I have to agree with the authors when they say that the readerswith a literary background may find this book frustrating. As thetitles tells this is a practical course book. The question is: a course of stylistics or a grammar course? Students might find it a good helper to review every grammatical spot.It covers all topics related to the use of grammar into literary prose and non-fictional texts. But, it does not clarify for the beginners ""what in the world is stylistics"". Concerning about this particular subject many questions remain... If you are looking for a ""step by step"" introduction to stylistics this is not the book for you... On the other hand, if you already have some background on this discipline here you can find a few good texts to think of..."
5,great shirt!,"this shirt fits great. the item description was very accurate. there was a slight problem with shipping, but the seller had great communication. A+!!!!"
5,If You Love Twist Endings,"I loved the twist ending! Twist endings rule. Mary rules, I know what to do when that happens to me."
1,BORING!!!,"Okay, nothing even the slight bit scary happened in this book! it was just stupid! I loved allof the seniors books i've read (all of them) except this one."
1,Okay it is not that good.,"I didn't like the book because I don't like Mary O'Connor because she always always was talking about the Social Studies teacher Mr. Morley, and she shoplifts all the time. And the character Rob had little information about himself. I didn't like the ending because it was too hard to follow. Mary was jumping to different topics way too fast. The book said that she was putting poison in the cup and then it was sleeping powder."
5,These turtles are cute!,"I don't have these, but I do have other LPS toys, and I am definetely putting these on my x-mas list! The only problem with these is that they are WAY too pricey! I could find these at Target or Walmart for half the price! These turtles are so adorable, and I can't wait to get them!"
2,Slip-ons,"I usually love slip-ons because they are quick and easy, but these are a little too slippy. With each step my feet come almost completely out of them, and forget trying to walk fast or run... They'll come completely off!"
3,Beware!,"The writing here is topnotch and the inside stuff pretty interesting, but in the end, ""The Nightingale's Song"" is little more than a political hit-job. Poindexter, McFarlane and North are exceptional in their weaknesses and faults; McCain and Webb knights in shining armor. Eleven years after this book came out I doubt that Timberg would even treat McCain as well. If you are of the conservative bent you will find this book tough going."
3,the nightingale's song,"this book was a gift from my daugther. she figured that since i was in the the navy during the 70,80,90's that i would like it. the author did bring to light some of the problems during the time frame of the book. however, i feel it just held WEB in too high standard and made NORTH look BAD. when in fact NORTH was just doing a dirty job his COMMANDER IN CHIEF wanted him to do."
4,GREAT COOKBOOK FOR EVERYONE,"I bought this book when it was first published and I have lost 50 lbs with it. Unfortunately, my dog found the book tasty and chewed it up, but I am definitely replacing it. I thought the points section helpful but not inclusive enough. Also, Weight Watchers could have included activity points information enjoyed this book as much as I enjoy[...]."
2,y'allz is krrzee,"The music is trippy, the tones suggestive etc, but this is the vocally worst record of all time. Might someone have mentioned this in a review? What is bad singing if the hell that this is is unworthy of mention?I can get into the panning on headphones but if anyone I know heard me playing this....... The sound bites suggest something else, be warned that the worst trite English hippy crap awaits you as soon as the cool intro ends."
5,diverse direction,"Like other reviewers. I also find this aurally great. Anyone wanting an interesting sonic layered progressive electronic pieces, will most likely not go wrong. This material is about thirty years old. Shows prog music - lightheartly humorous (1st five tracks) and dark near demonic (visitation and electricstorm - think Freddie Kruger stuck in Twilight Zone). An etheral/candy for your ears. For those who find it White Noise 2 is much like last tracks of White noise 1, but dramatic subtler and not as dark. White noise Re-entry and IV for serious completist (refer to New Sonic Architecture [NSA] website for synopsis of Re-Entry and IV)."
1,Rubbish,"In the late 60s through the 80s, it was very common for historians, filmmakers, and authors to make the founding fathers look like demigods. But, in recent years, people have finally realized that the presidents were HUMAN and did things that we did not expect.The truth is, this book follows in the line of thinking that Jefferson was a demigod and that he could do no wrong. The evidence is overwhelming that 6 children resulted from the Jefferson-Hemings union. I say this as a Jefferson scholar, having written numerous research papers on the subject, including a masters' thesis (where this book was used as a source).What is really comes down to is what you believe. The evidence is there. And personally, I don't think it made Jefferson any less impressive as an inventor, writer, and president. If you're interested in learning more, read any of Annette Gordon-Reed's work. And read the DNA report for yourself, available on the Thomas Jefferson Foundation website."
1,"Disappointing and misleading ""defense"" of Jefferson","The authors who have banded together to ""defend"" Jefferson from the ""travesty"" of the ""charge"" that he and Sally Hemings had a sexual liaison that produced children have done all involved a sad disservice. The personal hostility of the authors to such scholars as Annette Gordon-Reed, and to the leadership of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, undermines any attempt to take their position seriously. They have assumed their conclusions and are determined to pound them home. They quote out of context, omit vital factual data, present sources as saying the opposite of what they say, and otherwise muddy the waters to the point of impenetrability.-- R. B. Bernstein, Adjunct Professor of Law, New York Law School"
5,The myth is again slammed by the truth,"This is a great book with a variety of points that explain why Sally Hemmings was never more than a slave to the President. Mr Jefferson was in the public eye most of his life and none of these allegations were ever mentioned until after his death. The people who want to defame this President are those who want to build a case for reparations for their ancestors who were allegedly indentured in our early history. Of course, our country was the first to abolish slavery and is to this day the freest country in the world. To say Sally Hemmings was a concubine is a lie to get political dollars from a dead man. My ancestry is traced to Wales.........maybe I can build a case against some dead Englishman whose people attacked and killed the Welsh hundreds of years ago. Give this issue a break! Jefferson has been gone over 100 years."
5,"If you want more from your mini, get this book","The mac mini is great as it is....but some (like me) think it needs a little more. This book with help you take your mac mini from plain to BLING, and have fun doing it. there are ideas for every skill level from simple to complex.Get this book."
5,Great Adventure,A very cinematic experience. The voice acting is beautiful. I give it the highest rating!
3,Older game with poor graphics by todays standards,"A bit cludgy running on Vista. Had to install a useless DDL, just to get the game to install. But I did not have to then run it in a compatibility mode. It did go ahead and use the vista tools. The interface is a bit old, not real user friendly, and the graphics are poor by todays standards, but it does have a pretty good story line. It is a serial game where everything has to be done in a serial sequence."
1,Couldn't run it,"My guess is that because this is a game designed for older machines, the current drivers on my computer, windows 7, don't support the game architecture. Nothing I could do to get this game to run."
4,Echolink - the ins and outs.True..........,"I have seen IRLP in action and thought to myself how do I do this? So I searched everywhere and found out that Echolink was the local popular form,but apart from the echolink on-line manual couldn't find much else to help me get an angle on this.This book has been a welcome book to help me understand all about the subject - it really gives all the resources and information needed to get going.But as always it is not only the book that's important - it is taking action that is the exciting part.One of our local radio clubs MDRC just had a really successful meeting with standing room only on echolink and it is going to get bigger.I think this book is a good start so you can learn enough to get into it,get your feet wet and get that experience to write the next ""update"".Petervk4cbd"
4,IRLP,I bought this book for a friend of mine who has been interested in IRLP for some time and was not sure how to get started. we had constructed a DTMF unit so he could assign the required codes but something was missing. he could not find any info on the subject so i did some research for him and came across this book.after reading it myself i could see that there was much more to this new type of comunication technique. he obviously needed other gear to get him going and this book explains what hardware and software is required.he was very happy to receive the book because now he can see what is required to get him up and running.the book is easy reading and explains what is required in simple terms.I hope it solves his problem.
3,Missing some newer skils and services ...,"This is a good book, it covers the basics of VoIP. However since it has come out there have been some major changes. As only to be expected with computers and radios ... So I give this a 3 / 5, not the best but still good."
4,"Great Flip-Flop for the price I paid, although plastic hurts a little","I love love these flip-flops and who could beat a Tommy shoe for the price I paid (under $10). The plastic is a little uncomfortable on the top of my foot though and left a mark on me. Still, I think they'll stretch a bit more and I think it was a good deal."
5,Cozy shoulder heat wrap,"I had one of these for five years and just had to throw it away. I couldn't find the original company on the computer. I saw this, it looks just like my old one, fits just like my old one. But it does have a scent whereas my old one did not have a scent. But I love it and I need it."
3,It's okay,"To me, it's nothing special. It doesn't work that great and I don't even have rosacea bad. I wouldn't buy again."
1,More snake oil,"This does absolutely nothing for the redness Rosacea sufferers endure. The green tint does not help in the slightest. The product is almost as thin as chicken broth. In fact, the product application is akin to smearing green chicken broth on your skin. There really is no redeeming quality to this product. You know how they say there really is no cure for Rosacea? Well, you won't find one here either. I know how it is. I wanted this product to be the one as well. I just don't understand how companies can still market snake oil products like this. Total waste of your money."
1,Boo!,"I really did not like anything about this product. It came out super greasy, smelled absolutely awful, and made my face /redder/ than it originally was. Maybe it's different for every person, but it's definitely not for me!"
1,dud,"Maybe this product works for some people, but it did not work for me. I bought it because it was among the least expensive treatmenst for rosacea. Unfortunately, it made the flare up worse! Thankfully, I noticed it in time, and the flare up has not spread to become worse. I just want to know if this has actually worked for someone else? Wish I could return it! I should have bought it at Ulta! They'll refund or exchange duds for you! My mistake! Buy your cosmetic products at Ulta! They have a great return policy. They'll let you return a product even after you open and use it! Because they know that many times you waste money buying a product that ends up not working for you. I love Amazon, but doubt they would receive a dud back in this instance."
5,This stuff is amazing,"I rarely give 5 stars, but this deserves all 5.My skin has been irritated dehydrated and flaky for months. I tried many different products, some of them pretty pricey and none of them worked as well as this product. If you have sensitive, rosacea, dehydrated and or flaky patches this is the solution.The price is very affordable."
2,Very Greasy,"If you have problems with acne AND rosacea, then this product is not for you. It makes your skin extra oily so you have more breakouts. Not too impressed with this product."
2,"Seller great, product did nothing.","Price and delivery of product was great. Product did nothing for my rosacea, in fact it made it worse by drying my skin out. The product made the appearance of the rosacea diminished, at first, due to its green tint, but the actual condition worsened. Great seller, but the product is not for me."
5,My Face is Happy to Find this Product Again!,"I think I initially purchased this product just because I hadn't tried it before. I was shocked that it worked. Well since then, I was not able to find it any where. Thanks Amazon, for saving my face, literally! Skeptics - be skeptic no longer - this truly works."
5,"Good, but not entirely accurate.","At the time this book was published, it was 100% accurate. It was published during the first term of William the Impeached. Now, years later, it is quite clear that this administration did accomplish a few negative things that set our country back a century or so. If you want, you can purchase this book and write them in."
2,Be warned:,"This book is a joke.That's not meant in a derogative sense, that's meant literally. It's completely blank inside.It might make a briefly humorous gag gift, but really it's one of those books that's most notable for simply existing, to be used as an amusing tidbit at parties or water cooler talk."
5,spongebob squarepants wall border,"The instructions were very clear which made the border very easy to apply . I actually knew what i was doing , which made the final outcome very nice . It is a nice touch to a paint job !"
2,A disappointment!,"I gave it only 2 stars because it was marked ""6"", and it is really a 9 or 10! Too much trouble to return and I'd be paying shipping, so I gave them away. They looked lovely, but they were huge and no way could I use them. This is a loser."
1,What's Up with my Order?,My order didn't arrive I don't know if my money was put back but I was unhappy with this order.
1,What The Hell Happened,"What the hell happened to these guys, not that they had much to offer in the past but damn, this is the apitamy of falling off. This band sucks just more so then they ever did. When your a big name band in the past then you come to play the Charleston Municipal Auditorium, you have really hit rock bottom!!. You can bet I will not be attending, and i cant imagine many others attending either!Give it up Godsmack your not with the times anymore, your horrible"
4,A rare Album,"Godsmack in my opinion is one of the best band out there.IV is a strange album it has some good songs ,and some bad songs.Overall 80/100best songs:mama,the enemy,speak"
5,AWESOME!,"Every song on this album is great. Some are more mellow, some are hard, some are in between. It shows their diversity and talent. Highlights: Shine Down (Kinda religious surprisingly), Speak, The Enemy, Bleeding Me, (and I don't care what everyone says), Livin in Sin."
4,Diehard Fan,With the different music styles on this cd it shows that they are very musical and do different styles and be good at it.
3,"Eh, how much to pay?","I am going to say that it isn't that I don't like this album... I just do not feel the previous passion that Godsmack captured. Sully's image for the band hasn't really changed over the last few albums, and this album kind of relaxed and sat down very quickly in my collection. The funny thing when I listened to it was there are no ""Go Aways"" but there seem to be just as many ""Yeahs"" and if you listen to Godsmack you know what I mean! I still subscribe to Awake the 2000 release . It had originality and passion."
4,Surprisingly good!,"I am not really a fan of this band. I always wrote them off as an AIC ripoff that played senseless andgry Nu-Metal. This album is different. They experimented a little, and put some variety in their songs. Like another reviewer said, I am reminded al of Metallica's ""Load"" and ""ReLoad"" at times, and that is not really a bad thing. Definetly worth the price! If you like rock, pick this up."
4,Not Bad Senior Set,"If you are on here bashing this album because it sounds the same. One band I can tell you that has survived since the early 70's is AC/DC. They are my fav band, Angus once got upset when someone said how does it feel to have 12 album sound the same, he goes, its 13 albums that sound the same. They are the greatest rock band ever. So i applause Godsmack for keeping it the same. Those who stray from their roots, METALLICA, FAIL horribly. They havent had a decent album since the sellout black album. So Good Stuff, G, keep it up. ROCK ON!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,It's Okay....,"After hearing hours and hours worth of ""Speak"", ""Shine Down"" and ""The Enemy"" on my favorite radio station, I decided to pick up this CD. I listened to it once through and found that I liked its catchy riffs and Sully Erna's low, crooning vocals. As I started to listen to it more and more, however, it began to dawn on me that this album is very long for the small, simplistic formula that Godsmack decides to use. Don't get me wrong, the band's sound is cool and entertaining, but having never owned one of Godsmack's other CDs, it just really isn't one of those albums that I'm going to play the heck out of. There is some fair variety here, tracks like the slow ballad ""Hollow"" or the thundering African drums of ""Voodoo Too"", but overall the disc is pretty front-loaded. The singles are tracks 2, 3, and 4. It's an average CD that I'll listen to every so often and enjoy it when I do, but I was really hoping for more."
4,Solid Modern Rock With Great Vocals,"I have never been a huge fan of Godsmack (I wonder if they have to pay royalties to Alice In Chains for that....), but I have always liked the singer Scully's voice, and seem to always wish I had some of their discs around....the guitarist also plays some pretty cool riffs, and has a great, thick tone that I like. Having owned no previous Godsmack albums, I picked up their latest and liked it even more than I thought I would.A good modern rock/metal album with a nice flow and some variety all the way through, with especially standout vocals and some interesting experimental textures and guitar...I also like the sequel to their breakout hit from '98 ""Voodoo Too"". Pretty cool stuff, really. I listen to way too much prog metal, and sometimes this sort of thing is just what I want to hear. Cool stuff, check it out."
2,reverberated rehashed same old tired riffs and then some crap to boot,this is almost as bad a metallica's load and reloaded crap. this band has little to stand out from the crowd from to start with and the release this sad!!!!!!!
3,not their best,I liked this album but I just think their early records were overall more enjoyable listens then this was. I think they expanded which is good but I just hope the new record will be better. due out in early 10 godsmack fans so keep your eyes out for it. also there doing a web series of the making of their 5th album so check that out godsmack fans.
4,Godsmack,"I love Godsmack and this CD is okay...not one of their best, but there is still some great songs on this CD. Still worth buying."
1,garbage,"Another example of how low the music industry has sunk. While far superior albums in this vein -- Guided by Voices' recent efforts come to mind -- sell in meager quantities, garbage like this is flying off the shelves. Chalk it up to superior marketing, I guess. The worst part is the way these guys wear their Boston background on their sleeves. Boston musicians like Modern Lovers, the Cars, Mission of Burma, and Aimee Mann must die a little every time these clowns on television."
1,Big Disappointment,"I have been a HUGE fan of Godsmack since the very beginning. They are a truly talented band, and one of my top 5 favorite bands. However, I sure am glad that I only paid the special Amazon price of $8.96, instead of a normal CD price. 'IV' is a classic example of a popular band that has a magical musical formula for success, and that formula has worked for them on all of their past CD's, and then they decide, ""Hey, let's experiment and try something different since we are famous and everyone will buy it, even if they don't care for it, we'll still make millions."" Of course, Sully's voice is awesome as always, and the musicianship is top notch. 'Speak' is classic killer Godsmack, and 'Temptation' runs a close second. However, they need 9 new tracks to complete the CD. I'll save 'Speak' and 'Temptation' to my computer and MP3 player, but the CD will get buried in some cabinet, and I will anxiously await their next release, which hopefully will revert back to the magic formula!"
5,Still my favorite band *****************************,"Godsmack fan since day 1 and still am. I have seen them in concert twice and can't wait to see em again. For those who say they don't change and it all sounds the same can take a spoon and eat my a$$. I'm an AC/DC fan and most of theres sound the same. And for the reviewer that says wait for Pearl Jam!!!! Who the hell are they. Talk about bubblegum rock! And another thing, AIC was awesome so what if you say these guys are wannabe AIC'ers. Who gives a $hit. If it sounds good then turn it up and let Sully wail and enjoy it. This album is awesome and on song 11 - One Rainy Day the song ends (or the raindrops) at about 7:10, it picks up again at 12:27 so fast forward or let the song roll until that mark. Godsmack is the $hit!!!!!!Buy this."
2,Not my favorite Godsmack cd,"This cd does not work. It sounds so processed at times, way too far the other way for me. I do appreciate them trying to change it up a little, but it's time to get back to the godsmack we love. Bring back the soul!!"
4,I almost gave up on them..,"I loved their first two cds, and even listened to the first one enough to wear it out. (Seriously, no scratches- it just started skipping here and there).The day Faceless was released I took a friend with me to buy it, and was completely disappointed. They tried to expand on Voodoo.. and failed horribly. I decided to ignore that cd's exsistance.I feel this cd is a return to their roots- their first two cds. I was excited to hear Voodoo Too (the name made me a little weary), but I would have been more excited about it all if this were their third album. I'm honestly still a little scarred from Faceless."
2,How can aggression sound boring?,"Godsmack has pulled off a feat: making tortured, aggressive sound, innovative production, quality musicianship and clever lyrics seem so ... boring. Their anger, their sabre-rattling at imagined enemies, it doesn't feel like they believe it themselves. There is a lot of squandered potential here."
4,good new sound from the smack!,"i have been a godsmack fan since 98' when the first album hit. i have all there cds. 4 is a great album. it mixes the old sound with something new. a little less heavy then my favorite godsmack album AWAKE,but still heavy. i recommend it to any rock fan out there. favorite songs shine down,voodoo too."
2,I AM REALLY REALLY DISAPPOINTED!,I love Godsmack. They are one of my top favorite bands. This album is not Godsmack. It does have some good songs on it but as a whloe I am not very happy. It is so much softer than the other albums. There are wayyyyyy too many slow songs. I mean I don't buy a rock album to here ballads. That's like buying a Metallica to here a bunch of songs like The Unforgiven. It must be something new bands are trying because the new Rob Zombie album is the same way. BIG disappointment. Anyway! Godsmack is meant to ROCK and they just don't do it in this album.
2,Embarrased,"That is what you should be, I don't know... Maybe I am the only one left in the world with this bands first album, but I dare you to compare the two... I did it to prove a point to a friend. Listen to the original ""voodoo"" and then ""voodoo II"" it is just a crying shame!!!"
2,Love Godsmack and the songs on this but bad recording,"There are plenty of songs I like off this album but they just don't sound right, it's all too processed sounding and fake. The mixing isn't right either, it's actually hard to listen to. I don't think the songs are bad but the way they are recorded and mixed just ruins this album. Too much mass appeal kind of sound."
2,Don't waste your money!,"Brussels is a great getaway for US Eastcoasters, but you do not need this book to steer you in the right direction unless all you plan to do is SHOP! I believe that this little pocket-size tome is a glorified advertisement for several small select restaurants and stores in the historic centre. The maps are too general, not specific enough for a real walking tour. I left this little book in the hotel room. One would do better to go to a website on Brussels, then visit the tourist centre in the Grand Place for a map that is helpful. Once again, if all you want to do is shop, then this little book would be a minor help."
2,Boring,"Just watched this with my daughter and we both fell asleep due to the boredom. Elle Fanning did a great job with her character, but neither that nor all the frontal nudity could make this movie very interesting to me."
1,Somewhere... but I can't find it,"I can't find the meaning of this movie. It's probably one of the worst I have seen. Painful to watch, uughhh. The film abuses long looooong takes and has no body, no message, no nothing, it's air. Author pretends to sell the movie to a public that relates to loneliness in a multi million dollar environment. BS! Sould have spend the money in a romantic comedy with dogs or donkeys, at least that will be entertaining.Worts movie I have seen in a while, since the crappening by the indian guy."
1,"Excellent actors, mind-numbing film","What a waste of talent this film was. All of the actors were believable and natural. But when the screen goes black right before the credits roll, you're going to want to swear. Trust me, the boredom you experience during the first half hour will only intensify as the film drags on. A storyline would have been a nice touch."
3,Lost in Translation 2,"I don't really get why people who hate a movie come on here and review the video release, but this movie isn't for those looking for standard Hollywood fare in the same way that the Velvet Underground isn't for Britney fans.If you liked Lost in Translation, this is it's poorer, simpler cousin. Most of the same thematic and visual vocabulary is there. If this movie has a problem it's that Stephen Dorff lacks Bill Murray's ability to convey his inner monologue through looks alone. But as a meditation on celebrity in America, this film is just as valid, if a little like a rerun from Sophia."
1,Somewhere to nowhere,"The first few scenes pretty much lay out the outline for the film....slow, repetitive, and pointless. Know that you won't get those few hours of your life back after spending our most valuable commodity (time) for this film."
2,A little disappointed....,"I was a little disappointed in this movie. I feel so much more could have been done with it. While Elle and Stephen put in very repectable performances, I felt cheated with all the artsy crap. The storyline was good but there was to much trying to show Stephen's characters disenchantment with what his life had become. The car in the beginning going around and around, come on already. The twin strippers was weak the first time, I didn't need to see it again. Boring. I hope their bad pole work was part of the script.Like I said Elle and Stephen did the best they could under the circumstances. I don't think I will be buying anymore of Ms. Coppola's directing endeavors. I didn't like Sideways either."
1,I Should've Walked Out of the Theater.,"As far back as I can remember, I have never been tempted to just get up and walk out of the theater because a movie was so bad. That is, until now.""Somewhere"" is sooo boring. The car at the film's start that just goes around in circles, the noise of it's engine a numbing drone, sets the tone for the movie. There were at least two or three points where I almost stood up to yell ""Omigod, will somebody just DO something!"" at the screen.Don't get me wrong. I liked ""Lost in Translation"". But as far as I can see, the only thing that Sofia Coppola achieved with this film was to actually make a pole dancing scene boring. And that's saying something."
1,"Empty, trite movie","I found virtually no redeeming qualities to this film. I should have been forewarned if I knew Sophia Coppola was also responsible for Lost in Translation, another abysmal film. She must think those who view her films are stupid, and maybe she has a point because I still watched this film after loathing Lost in Translation. The opening scene has you watching our anti-hero race around the track five times... I got it after the third time around the track. Here's a guy who is going nowhere. She beats you over the head with every point she tries to make. The ending is so predictable if not totally inane. Our anti-hero pulls his Ferrari to the side of the road, leaving his keys inside, and walks away with a bemusing smile on his face, as if telling us he is done with the life of Hollywood. Of course he's also apparently walking away from his daughter who seemed to give some meaning to his otherwise pathetic existence. MISS THIS ONE!Somewhere"
3,Lost in Tranlastion 2: Boredom in L.A.,"This film is about a rich, lonely, bored, person of privalege, territory that it seems Ms. Coppola has covered several times before, albeit maybe covered a bit better before. I think it would be nice if the director could tackle some other themes- other than the bored put upon celebrity. In a time and in a world where people are having real problems, this movie just seemed frivolous to me. We get it- the world can be an artifical place where wealthy famous people can become lost...next. I would like to think the director has a bit more range than this. That being said, the cinematography and sountrack are beautiful, per usual for a Sofia Coppola film- who I think is an extremely talented director. I was just hoping for more with this one."
4,Somewhere,"This is not ""Lost in translation 2"" but for fans of that movie you just might like this one as well. ""Somehwere"" certainly does have some familiar themes we witnessed in Lost In Translation. Themes such as isolation, loneliness. Existential questions such as why am I here, and is what I think important really that important? Stephen Dorff does a good job in portraying a rather miserable movie star in the prime of his career with money, a black Ferrari, room service and call girls. Johnny Marco has it all yet he has nothing. He is bored, burned out and unhappy. With no one who truly cares about him. Then steps in his often forgotten daughter played by Elle Fanning who he finds solace in. Sound familiar? It is but is done very well and in many ways is quite different from LIT. Worth renting or buying."
2,Somewhere goes Nowhere.,"Is Sofia following in her father's footsteps, starting out strong and slowly weakening? Lost in Translation was a true sleeper. It came out of nowhere and delighted viewers all over the world.Somewhere exposes us to a very dull guy, hanging out with his daughter, doing little or nothing. One clue to a weak script is how much time is devoted to traveling scenes; enroute,walking, driving etc. You might say Somehere is lost in transportation.The daughter is the only character with any appeal or animation. Made me think a script about her and her troubled mother would have been the way to go.I still admire Sofia Coppola and the fact that she attempts to deliver originality. I think she is a truly creative force to keep watching.I wait for her next one...to go somewhere and take us along."
1,LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY!!!!!,"This movie is so boring I had to watch it in three parts. There was no story whatsoever, the audience are mere observers to a loser guy living in a hotel who spends time with his daughter occasionally. Nothing ever happens!!! You are warned!!! SSSSSZZZZZZZZZZ"
1,CLUNKER,"VAPID, BORING AND INANE. I HAVE WATCHED OVER 7,000 MOVIES IN MY LIFETIME AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CLUNKERS (BAD MOVIES) OF ALL TIME. A WINNER AT A FILM FESTIVAL IS A BIG JOKE. WATCHING DORFF TAKE A SHOWER TWICE TO KNOW THAT HE HAS HAIR ON HIS ARM PITS, AND WE GET TO SEE IT TWICE. POLE DANCING WITHOUT REMOVING CLOTHES IS AS DUMB AS YOU CAN GET AND ALSO SHOWN TWICE."
1,Nothing to say disguised as art,"As someone who loved ""Lost in Translation"" for its ability to speak volumes with understated performances and economy of dialogue, ""Somewhere"" takes a similar approach but fails entirely. The characters are far less compelling, elements that might be construed as a narrative are threadbare at best and the movie, despite its lethargic pacing, quickly begins to feel like a self-indulgent exercise in examining the emptiness and monotony of an actor's life. This actor (the character, not Stephen Dorff), unfortunately for the film, isn't one who's interesting, gifted, articulate or insightful upon self-reflection. By about a third of the way in, this movie began to feel more like ""Nowhere with Nothing To Say."" This lame exercise disguised as minimalism signals that either the director has run out of inspiration or needs to get a taste of life outside of the self-absorbed self-fascination of Hollywood."
1,Does it go somewhere?,"Nope! It goes Nowhere!I was expecting a more compelling character driven movie. It attempts to portray some sense of emotional realism but the main chAracter was too flat to care for.This seems to be a film which indulges the yearnings of an actor and a director. It is visually stark at times and something humorously mundane. This may have functioned well as a series of still photographs where the audience participates in creating their own narrative. But Somewhere as film offers no narrative structure, no plot, simply mood. Something which does not take 90 minutes to convey.I was looking forward to this film but was disappointed. If you like watching banal scenes of driving, eating, showering, then this may be for you. Otherwise look somewhere else."
1,Bored Me To Death,"That had to be one of the most boring movies I've ever sat through. I just kept thinking..it's got to get better...but it didn't. No story line, no excitement. They tried to throw in a little skin and make it more appealing but it didn't help. Such a terrible waste of money. Can't believe they actually spend the money to make such a movie. Let's try to get a good script next time people. Geesh."
1,An Honest Appraisal,I would like to write a review of this film but I had to kill myself after the first 45 minutes.
1,this movie sucked and bit at the same time,This movie was so bad I feel sorry for the people that actually took months out of their life to create it. Wow- our society has hit a new low
1,Terribly Lonely,"Long ago Noel Coward wrote a song about a movie star, ""Louisa', which perfectly sums up this self-indulgent mess:here's a line:""She derived little fun from the Oscar she won, & none from her home in Bel Air."""
4,What is this madness?,"A lot of people are bashing this movie for being pointless and boring. True, it is very drawn out but that is the point. Watching the plaster dry and watching him drive around is intended to show what his life has become. The end was kind of sudden and it required a minute of thought to decipher what it meant. Like, why the middle of nowhere? That's a nice car, man! Don't just leave it! Anyway, this movie is for those who are patient and can pick apart what every little bit means."
3,No 250-page Grammar Reference Section,"The description states that it contains a '250 page grammatical reference section at the back'. So I was looking to see grammar reference in addition to the dictionary, but I didn't find any 250-page grammar section. Instead, there is a 9-page 'Guide to Russian Grammar' section after the Russian-English dictionary. Maybe this is an issue with US edition but I'm disappointed the dictionary didn't fit the description."
5,Well pleased,I was in a play based on this book and was really curious to read the original. I didn't want to spend much and was thrilled to find the book on Amazon for a good price. The book was in as good a shape as advertised and I got it even before I expected it.
2,LAMPS PLUS SLOW DELIVERY NO SHADE,sLOW DELIVERY SERVICE FROM lAMPS PLUS. WHEN FINALLY RECEIVED THEY NEGLECTED TO SEND THE SHADE. CUSTOMER SERVICE VIA THEIR 800 NUMBER WAS RUDE. NOW WAITING FOR THE SHADE TO BE SENT.
3,"A solid book, but try to get the new edition.","The Yookoso text is an good system for learning in a classroom setting at the college level. The tapes used in conjunction with the texts can be quite helpful. However, I would suggest you try to find the newer edition of the Yookoso books and tapes. On their own the tapes are not very helpful, and if you intend on purchasing them you should be- 1.learning in a classroom and 2. be prepared to buy the text. Yookoso focuses on language structure and the writing systems, so excellent for learning how to read and write Nihongo. But, if you are trying to learn conversational Japanese, you should look elsewhere."
1,Not for Mac users,"This modem causes nothing but problems with my iBook. I can log on to my ISP, but when I disconnect, the computer continues to show the status as ""Disconnecting"" forever. The only way to reconnect is to restart the machine. And, on restart, I get a kernel panic every time before the shutdown process properly completes. Bestdata's tech support suggested that I try other modem scripts on the installation CD. I tried all 4 without success.It's possible that the problem was specific to my Mac. If you decide to take a risk and try this product despite my experiences, make sure that you experiment with the product immediately. Amazon won't take it back after 30 days, and although Bestdata offers a warranty, they won't give you a cash refund if you have compatibility problems. I waited too long to try it and got stuck with a lemon."
2,Software incompatable?,"Rumours are that it doesn't work with XP SP2, but maybe with XP SP1. Not with Vista, also. Research this problem if you are considering buying it. It works with LINUX, people say. It gets good reviews for earlier versions of Windows. CS doesn't respond to email or online posts about this problem."
5,Great book for curious kids,"I bought this book for my curious little girl. There is a wealth of information, and I even found it interesting! The book is suited for 5 years and up in my opinion."
5,Fabulous book!,"I got this book for my 6 year old son. I have a few books about the body and I have found that most are not descriptive enough when going through the body systems. They were fine when my son was younger, but now he asks many more questions and I find myself having a harder time explaining how the body works. So, I got this book along with a real working stethascope for children. Every night he loves reading through a few pages at time of this book. He really enjoys telling others what he has learned the night before... Sometimes the infomation is a little too descript, and other times not enough. But, overall, it is an excellent book to help your child understand the wonders of the human body. I would highly recommend this for children 5 years old and up."
5,my boys love it,My boys 6 and 8 find this book to be very informational and it goes along perfectly with the info they are currently learning in school.
5,Just Awsome !,Have really enjoyed reading this to my kids it's simple answers to some hard questions kids have!Certainly recomend to parents with curous kids!
5,Comprehensive book for yound kids,This is a great book for kids about the human body. My four year old loves reading and looking at this book and she has retained more information than I thought about the human body. It has been a great starting place for many discussions about the body - how blood works really fascinates her. The pictures are great and it has enough information on each page to be informative but not too boring. A great resource for young children about how the body works.
2,"Good overall, but where is the male and female anatomy?","I bought this book for my daughter, who's almost 4, because she started to ask questions about how boys' and girls' bodies are different, and I wanted some simple anatomy illustrations to aid our discussion. I find it exceedingly odd that a book called First Human Body Encyclopedia never mentions the penis, not even within the context of the urinary tract. Four whole pages are devoted to the urinary system, but there's not a single description or diagram to help me explain why boys pee standing up and girls pee sitting down. There's also a section on reproduction, complete with talk of eggs, sperm, the uterus, and fallopian tubes, and even a female reproductive diagram to go with it, but no vagina. How is that even possible? Is it some sort of last-ditch effort to help mom and dad avoid questions about sex? They're such glaring and bizarre omissions that I can't give this book a high rating, even though it's well-written overall."
4,Functional and comfortable.,Purchased these for comfort and easy to wear and they met both. I will probably purchase more similar pants in the future.
1,Decorative Mini Murals You Can Paint,"The title suggests you can paint mini murals from this book, no you probably can't. I purchased this book as a fun gift for a budding hobby artist friend. It really isn't worth opening the front cover, so many other books will serve you better. A big thumbs done on this one.Jill Ball"
2,Gwendal Lite,"Is this the same group that put out the fantastic Irish Jig, Joe Can't Reel, and Rainy Day? Nope. Only the woodwind player is the same, and you can hear his quality playing throughout...but it's still a very boring, oatmeal bland album. Two stars for musicianship."
4,I finally found it!,"I have been looking for the ""Swingin' the Alphabet"" song for years. Really! I taped all of AMC'c stooge marathon and never saw it. I bought the whole video just for this song, which my father used to sing to me and my sibs on long car trips. Now I want to order one for Dad!"
3,"One of the ""classic"" Stooge videos.","This is a hilarious collection of three outstanding comic gems; VIOLENT IS THE WORD FOR CURLY (1938), PUNCH DRUNKS (1934), and one of their funniest masterpieces A PLUMBING WE WILL GO (1940). If you want a classic comedy, get this. Directed by Jules White and Charley Chase."
5,THE most fantastic book on stormchasing ever written!,From the moment you start reading you are bound to continue. Very intense descriptions of chases. This is a MUST for anyone with even the slightest interest in severe weather. I'd rate it the stormchasing book of the century!
4,100% Faidley,"Warren Faidley, the world's only full-time storm-chasing journalist and his bestselling book are known by many in the small storm chasing community. Storm Chaser is perfect for the coffee table and for those who enjoy great weather photography but do not intend to study the scientific part of it seriously. This is a true-blue Faidley product: glossy, full color photos, excellent book layout, a sense of fun, but not much attention paid to meteorological aspects of storm chasing. For those who want some serious stuff, try Prof. Bluestein's ""Tornado Alley""."
5,He's Guttsy Alright!,This book takes place when Warren just started chasing. He did not take meteorology classes which means he only learned from chasing storms. There for he came close to death several times in this book. Which means there are many climaxes in this true story. I love this book because you can't put it down. I would recomend this book to anyone who storm chases wants to be a storm chaser or anyone who likes meteorology.
4,Good Book About Severe Weather,I think that the book was pretty good. It just needed to be a bit longer and have more tips at the end. But it teaches alot of stuff about weather for you future storm chasers (like me).
4,Good product at a bargain price,"I have owned this tent since June 2006 and I have used it about 10 times. When folded and packed it is the most compact tent I have ever seen (13""x6""). It is durable, and easy entry/exit, zippers work fine. It has held up nicely in very strong winds in Anza-Borrego Desert. The single wall design is great for windy/sandy conditions. Tent must be staked out to perform well. I invested in some MSR groundhogs, and prior to that I used some heavy duty steel tent stakes (with rubber mallet) for car camping. I have not tested it in rain so I can't give it 5 stars. Overall you will not find a better deal for the price."
5,good buy,For the price this tent is amazing. Looking at the zipper and stuff it it obviously cheaper material. It serves the purpose though. I have used it twice. The second time was in a severe thunderstorm with 2 inches of rain. I stayed totally dry. The only water that got in was a little around the zipper. Very light weight and packable. I will sum it up to nearly as good as tents 3-4x the price.
5,Exactly what I expected,"It's well built, was the right size, and fit my 1967 Cadillac perfectly. This does not come with the muffler clamps, so you should either order them separately or pick them up at your local parts store."
5,You'll fall in love with this blanket!!,"This blanket is so super soft, I could not leave it in the store! I wasn't sure how it would hold up after washing and drying, but this blanket is just as soft as it was when I brought it home. I can't wait to have my baby so he can enjoy it too! I bought one, and then I registered for another one in a different color. I hope someone gets it for me, I love it so much! You won't be disappointed with this one! It may cost a little more than the others out there, but it is worth every penny!"
1,generic babies r us brand falsely listed under a high end boutique brand!!!!,"do your detailed research! this item is 19.99 at babies r us, it is NOT Little Giraffe brand, so mad!"
1,MISLEADING NAME,"This item is NOT a Little Giraffe Blanket. It is a plain blue blanket by ""Koala Baby."" Don't be misled!"
3,It's okay,It does work and the instructions were easy enough to understand. It is a bit hard on some back areas.
4,helps,"The Health mark IV018240 is benefical. It takes some time to get use to the position on your back. I recommend it for anyone, unless you have severe back problems."
4,Solid Information,"This book is written from a Biblical perspective and non believers will find it hard to follow Larry Burkett's advice to tithe (give away 10% of your income to church or charity), one of the most important secrets for achieving financial independence. It also has a wealth (!) of information for people who are close to caling it quits before deciding on bankruptcy. And to the reviewers who found the stories corny, I can only say that any of these scenarios could easily happen to anybody who is less than savvy about their finances (80% of the general population?). I didn't give this book 5* because I wished there had been more information on how to whittle away at credit debt, and some of the optimal housing costs recommended totally ignore the reality for people living on the Northeast coast of the US (The West Coast proably, too!)."
5,Must-have reference book!,"Money. Is there a way to escape dealing with its hold on us? Only with God's help, and Burkett succinctly demonstrates and explains God's financial plan and how He expects us to approach money management.Burkett, founder and president of Christian Financial Concepts, provides a thorough line by line guidebook to eliminating debt-all debt.He shows us real life examples of couples who have come to him for counseling, (some so extreme that you would think there was absolutely no hope) and by applying God's principles brought them back to peace with God and their finances.This book is a must-have reference book for those who are interested in studying God's view on money management or those who hope to counsel others.--- reviewed by Robin Rider for Christian Bookshelf"
3,A bit of a warning.,"This book makes a number of excellent points regarding overspending, the culture of overconsumption, and the importance of a proper budget. It also has very thorough sections on dealing with creditors and credit agencies, and the ins and outs of filing for bankrupcy. That being said, I would like to add a caveat. When I purchased this book there were only a couple of reviews, and none of them mentioned the incerdibly strong Christian perspective offered in this book. While the financial advice is sound, I am not personally comfortable with some of the author's views on women and the family, nor with his emphasis on titheing. Had I known that these views provided the foundation for much of the author's advice, I probably would not have ordered this book."
3,Received my new? Clore 950 with no decals on it from Amazon,"Just received my Clore 950 Junp-N-Carry with a resealed factory box. Upon removing, there were no stickers/decals anywhere on the unit or paperwork. I called Clore immediately and explained my situation, they advised me Amazon will not exchange it and I would need to deal with them directly. In fairness, this appears to be a well build unit, however, I confused what happened to my unit. will keep you posted"
3,"Works fine, why so expensive?",Use it to jump a 7.8L Suburban. No issues. Have owned over a year.PROSWorks as expectedCONSWhy so expensive?
5,great,Have already used it on a diesel truck and a bobcat. Fired them both right up. Great purchase for me.
3,Not what I expected,"A book by Hyatt that intends (I think) to be psychotherapy via reading. Like most Falcon Press books, this contains excerpts from OTHER Falcon Press books conveniently reprinted. let the buyer beware."
4,collector,I bought this duck for my boyfriend because hehad a solid black duck on his dashboard and just recently painted his car and was talking about putting flames down the sides of the car. This duck was perfect for him. He's got a bad boy good boy image and the flames down the side were perfect in what he plans do to with his car.It sits today on the dashboard of his car next to the solid black devil duck.
1,Sad and disappointing . . .,"Liza, the legend. Avoid this performance if you want to remember her at her peak in the 60s, 70s & 80s. This concert showcases her decline. I can't imagine this performance winning a Tony. Sad & disappointing - to put it mildly."
1,Embarrassing,"The only reason you would buy this DVD is for nostalgia. It is one of the worst performances that I have ever seen by an acknowledged performer. She has completely lost it - voice, banter, dancing ability. She looked and acted as if she was sick - out of breath most of the time and looking like she was about to topple over. Sure she's 63 years old but she looked and acted as if she was a lot older. How on earth could this have won a Tony? The rest of the shows it was up against must have been even more awful."
2,Thompson Tribute Trivial,"Very disappointed with this DVD that is more a tribute to Minelli than to Kay Thompson. It's one of those ""you had to be there"" to appreciate it. And an overly long interview with Liza on the disc. Only redeeming feature is the four backup guys who sing and dance their hearts out."
1,"If you are outside of the USA, be mindful of BD region coding","I have been looking very forward to this BD, and held off till the exchange rate was a little better than it has been lately.BUT if you are not in a Region A zone, this disc will not play. Unlike some other BD's I have purchased (PASSAGE TO INDIA, SOUTH PACIFIC etc), this one was spat out by both my Samsung and Panasonic players.I'm sure it's a great performance, but I'll have to take the word of the other reviewers! OVERSEAS BUYER BEWARE.It's curious that the DVD is more expensive than the BD! Should have bit the bullet and kept on the safe side!"
1,Defective,"The product is defective. When you add water to this product, the cubes in the cells are supposed to expand to create dirt. I ordered three of these items and only one of the three worked. For the other two, I ended up with wet cubes but no dirt. The cubes did not expand in the slightest. I've used other brands that work much better and sell for a similar price. I would stay away from these. One star because they fail to fulfill their intended purpose."
1,Moldy greenhouse,"I don't know if it's the seller or the actual product but immediately after planting seeds mold started to form over all of the dirt. I've just wasted over 30 heirlooms seeds because the pellets were bad.The greenhouse had a few places where the plastic was bashed in and broken and there were no labels in my greenhouse, as described. I wouldn't recommend buying this from the Amazon seller."
3,Burpee Greenhouse,"The Greenhouse kit was all smashed and broken when I received it, fortunately I was able to push the cells back to their place and it's OK. not very pleased with the overall experience, the soil doesn't expand as much as I thought it would, just planted some seeds in it so, I'll have to wait and see if it works."
3,"""Indecent Proposal""","""Indecent Proposal"" draws you in. I did not like the premise of the book, and fully intended to stop reading it after the first chapter. I just couldn't seem to put it down. I still don't agree with the plot line, but it is quite a trip through the psyche. Gives insights that I didn't expect in this venue."
5,Great,"Definitely leaves you wanting more, fast paced and easy to read.so much better than the movie,I would feed read again"
3,I got it,I was sent the wrong cord twice but I finally received the right cord...works great and they do ship immediately and they did refund my shipping...reputable seller
2,"Scrolling is annoying, needs to be fixed","Long story short, everything works fine with the mouse. But pressing the middle button is much easier from the part of the wheel close to the center than the other. When I need to scroll up the result is that sometimes I mistakenly end up pressing the central button. Since I use a UNIX machine, this means I end up pasting the text in the clipboard in random places, sometimes not even noticing it. It has become annoying. I have never had a similar problem with any other mouse. Sorry Lenovo, but you need to fix this.I got this mouse at work, so I cannot tell from the technical details if it is exactly the same model (I wished there was something like the ISBN for books, but there is not). Although from the picture I can tell that it looks exactly the same."
2,Not Thinkpad quality.,"I bought this mouse to match my new Thinkpad, thinking that the plastic would match the texture and feel of the Thinkpad's surface. Unfortunately, it feels much cheaper than I expected, and I will probably upgrade to a Lenovo mouse that actually has the ""think"" brand on it.It works fine, though."
1,Is not IBM-branded!,This mouse is said to be IBM-branded. In fact it is Lenovo-branded. This is improper business practice.
3,Not useful for review of special relativity,"I have not reviewed the Solid State portion of the book, and my review is limited to the relativity portion. I have been very pleased with the other books in the excellent series, but in the area of special relativity, I found this one somewhat disappointing. There were only seven problems in this area, and three were essentially the same thing. One was the basic derivation of the Lorentz transformation, which can be found in any relativity textbook. As I mentioned, I can not speak for the Solid State part of the book, but if you expect a variety of useful problems on special relativity, you will be disappointed. The general relativity part is OK, but I do not know of many schools which include general relativity on their qualifying exams."
5,Invaluable,"All of these books titled ""Problems and Solutions on (subject): Major American Universities Ph.D. Qualifying Questions and Solutions"" are invaluable tools for a physics graduate student, in my experience.It is difficult to find solved problems concering the topics in this text, so it is smaller than some of the others. However, it is still invaluable.Criticism: Sparse index. You might find yourself adding a lot of notes of your own to the index as well as the contents.If you are a student in physics, I suggest that you get your hands on these books."
3,"Wrong picture, right description","This product is not the product pictured. Actual product is way smaller. Don't know if this is amazon's fault since there are multiple sellers of this item, but it was very misleading. Do not get this kennel if you have a pug because it is way, way to small. But it is a good product, I like petmate kennels and this one is a solid 5 stars. however, this is getting 3 in this review so that you don't make the same mistake i did and get this expecting a taller kennel. look on petmate's website for kennel cab medium for a real picture. I went out and got a intermediate size petmate kennel from a brick and mortar store after this fiasco. minus two stars for having to return this."
1,Medium Crate for a CAT!,"this crate was tiny, and there was a tag on in with a picture of a cat.... I got had! this is not a crate for a dog, and it is not considered medium for a dog...only for a CAT."
1,Lost My money!!!!!!!!,How dare you sell a product that does not work? Cheap! not to serve. Petmate As a renowned brand deceives buyers. Do not waste your money! Plastics of such poor quality that when you try to push the gray hooks to adjust the top to the bottom is simply impossible. Poorly finished. will attach photos to this comment. And ask My money back ....
4,Good quality,"Good quality, easy to put together. The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it looks larger in the picture than it is. I even had a tape measure to estimate size, and it is still a little smaller than I expected. Other than that, it is an awesome carrier!"
3,For lightweight use,"I ordered 2 of these for two separate places... for convenience. I looked into several different crates. This one was the most reasonably priced. A comparable crate was twice the money at Petco. It is a very lightweight, light duty kennel. It would not be one to use for a bigger dog or heavy use. My toy poodle is 10 pounds, however, they need to be able to stand and turn inside the crate so this was the smallest crate I could use, even though it notes ""ok"" for dogs 20 to 25 pounds... I would question that. It arrived as agreed and in good condition. I will say that you really need 4 hands to put together as it is flimsy to hold and try to clip. Because of how it clips with plastic clips it will not withstand abuse."
1,This book is for lovers of clutter.,"If you think every single thing in your house should be textured, patterned, fringed, ruffled, flowered, mirrored, distressed, overstuffed, and multi-colored, you will love this book. Otherwise, you won't."
1,This book is horribly designed (no pun intended),"I'm not sure who this is suited for. I think Martha can give you bettter, easier and cheaper tips. I did like Bill Phillips, though."
5,Hauntingly Beautiful,I saw her in a small coffee house and had to own her album. Her lyrics are from the heart. Wonderful songs and a great Voice!
4,Wonderful story,"Every time I read a book that Barbara Reid is involved in, I am amazed at her artistic skill. It is not surprising she has won almost every award for illustrators of Children's books. This is the story of Effie, a small ant with a very large VOICE. She scares all the other bugs she tries to befriend. Then one day she saves the other bugs and the rest of the ants from her colony. It is another great story for children of all ages."
5,Lost 80s masterpiece,"By 1988, Kim Wilde had fully made the transition from New Wave artist to pop star, and 'Close' is a pop masterpiece which sadly remains out of print to this date. It features a number of perfect pop singles 'You Came', 'Hey Mr. Heartache', 'Four Letter Word', and 'Never Trust a Stranger'. The production is top-notch and Wilde's mix of pop and HI-NRG dance was certainly edgier than anything out of the Stock-Aitken-Waterman factory.This was Wilde's peak as a pop star since she only released material sporadically in the years following. If you can find this album, buy it because it's a real find."
2,Maybe this movie would be better sweded,"What a bad bad movie. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. The acting was atrocious at best, the dialogue ...was there even a script? I could almost swear they ad-libbed most of the film. The movie is about these two guys that re-record famous movies with them as the main characters because the tapes at the video store were erased due to a magnetic charge. And everyone likes their versions.Cameos by Sigourney Weaver nor a performance by Danny Glover (horrible performance) could safe this movie. The entire thing was less than par. Jack Black was insufferable during the entire movie. This is possibly his worst performance. It was not even funny. If I had not been stuck in an airplane at the time, I would have turned it off."
2,Be Kind Rewind,"`Be Kind Rewind' is a film that looked great in the trailers and then failed to live up to it's promise. Following a VHS video rental shop that has all it's stock wiped and then re-records the films in their own unique style, this film was set up for plenty of laughs that didn't deliver. Jack Black was pretty nondescript this time around and from funny turns in films like `School of Rock' it was a disappointment to see him tread water and under perform here. The ending fizzled out and left you with no feel good feeling or indeed any strong feeling either way. I don't mind a Hollywood cop out, cheesy, happy ending in the right context and genre, but this film didn't even deliver that! This is a comedy film with few laughs and is one you could quite easily miss without worrying about it. Only a film for huge fans of Jack Black.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,Great Idea but poorly executed,"When I saw the previews for Be Kind Rewind I got excited and decided to buy the dvd. I had been saving it for a date night with my wife and finally gave it a play on Saturday.The idea of the movies being erased was a good idea and had the potential for some wacky high jink. Unfortunatly the scene was not very funny nor was it original. The premisis of re-doing all the movies was what got me to buy the dvd, but too little attention was given to these scenes and I clearly was hoping for more.There were gaps in the plot all through the movie, ie why was Jack Black afraid of microwaves, what was the relationship between Mike and the other video store owner or for that part Mr. Fletcher?This movie sounds great when you hear the pitch but it was poorly done and clearly was done on a low budget.Finally the plot to save the store seemed like an after thought and the final scene left me wondering what really happened."
3,Hmm..,"It seems that the negative reviews are proving the point of the movie. The new, young, glossy and glitzy will steal the attention of the majority almost every time. Unless you charge a lot for it and pin a fancy name to it (ie, Sweded.) This funny, thought-provoking movie succeeds in having me longing for the simple, sweet, innocence of old, whether it existed in reality or not. It's fresh. It's unique. It's entertaining. Everything a movie should be. Plus, it's got Jack Black and Mia Farrow. And Mos Def, to boot. Who I happen to think is highly underrated as an actor. See it and appreciate is as an homage to the rotary phone. Or the 8-track. Or the record player. Or whatever it is that clings to your memory as a part of the iconography of your generation. That which ignites the nostalgia in you..and that which your kids will one day roll their eyes at. The merging of the old and the new. And the oneness that emerges from the joining of the two."
3,Alright movie,This is an alright movie. I am a big Jack Black fan and this lives up to the expectations of a JB movie.
5,A funny film,"This was a funny film that I enjoyed quite a bit. You can read the synopsis for a better overall idea of what was in the movie but, I can say I recommend it if you like comedy."
2,Not what I expected,"While sometimes not meeting prior expectations yields a real diamond in the rough; with Be Kind Rewind, it's more like finding a dollar on the sidewalk. It's nice but it won't do much for you. The premise is interesting but there are simply too many plot holes to make it seem believeable and not enough laughs to make you not care. What you have is a slow moving ""little"" movie, cute at times, with good intentions and a good turn by Mos Def, but not much else. There are some humorous moments in the sweded movies but the artificially sweet ending rang hollow and the rest of the cast were pretty average. View before buying, unlike what I did which was to impulse buy it with the predictable remorse. A movie like this will be selling for under five bucks before long so just wait it out."
4,"wacky, funny & surprisingly touching","It's not a secret I have a soft spot for (in order): Mos Def, Michel Gondry and Jack Black. I read the middling reviews of Be Kind Rewind, and I had moderate expectations. The film is slow to start. When it does pick up, it's delightful, witty and surprisingly poignant. By embracing the ridiculous, yet brilliant plot, the film manages to plausibly straddle the line between preposterous and believable.It's refreshing to see Jack Black do comedy and drama; it helps restrain his wackiness into something more endearing. Danny Glover and Mia Farrow were fantastic. In this all-star cast, relative newcomer Melonie Diaz gave the best performance. I plan to make a point to see more of her films soon.This movie delivers many laughs and quite a few tears. It's definitely worth seeing. Even though it's perhaps not brilliant filmmaking, it is unique, refreshing, entertaining and touching. If I had the power to edit out the boring beginning and elongate the last hour, I would."
2,Far from classic Gondry,"I loved Eternal Sunshine and thought the Science of Sleep was really interesting and sweet but Be Kind Rewind tries way too hard to tug at the audiences heartstrings. Although the notions of nostalgia and community togetherness are noble, the script fails to make you truly feel for these characters and settles largely for plodding along with an insipid plot regarding Fats Waller. I left this film wondering if the whole experience was just an excuse for director Michel Gondry to make some zany props and outfits by using the pretext of remaking older films. Overall, very disappointing and to be honest, extremely boring. Don't believe all of the classic remarks on the DVD cover and other reviews. Approach with caution."
1,The Worst Movie Yet,"Saw this movie on United. Most passengers ""tuned-in"" when it started. Twenty mins latter, people started opening their shades and doing other things. No plot to speak of. Attempts to touch on lots of areas, but fails to make any point at all. Maybe watching a screen saver would be more entertaining."
1,Be Kind Rewind AND TAKE IT BACK TO THE STORE!,"I have no idea what the meaning on this movie was. I am still itching my head over it. It was not very well placed and who ever wrote it was unreal. There was not very much comedy too it.Guy gets electrocuted and is now a giant walking magnet, and he erases all the movies in the store. Which I still can't get, is I would assume the store that had VHS ONLY would not be good at all. Maybe if they changed the time to maybe in the early 1990s I would buy it.The two actors are not my favorites, but Jack Black has grown on me over the years.It's just a movie that was not well-written and the ending was not even that good either.I say just rewind and take it back to the store you got it from. Leave it alone!"
3,Entertaining,"Another Michael Gondry film, this one was a hell of a lot better than 'Human Nature'! Not a great movie, but it was pretty good and entertaining. Hit a little too hard on the anti-commercialism message for my taste. But the scenes where they are filming the replacement videos are a gas, and it's easy to get caught up in their enthusiasm."
3,"quirky, original, fun movie FATS WALLER LIVES !","I would have given this 5 stars for it's comedy value and originality if it weren't for one thing that Really bothers me: I would rate this movie G, if it weren't for about 20 seconds of very vulgar adult dialog in DVD scene #2. This is easily R rated dialog. If removed from the film, the movie would be for all ages. This 20 seconds ruins that. I wanted to give this DVD to my friend's 10 year old niece as a birthday present, but now I can't because of that 20 seconds. What the hell were the director and editor thinking?? One great thing about this movie is the love shown for Thomas ""Fats"" Waller, one of the greatest musician/entertainers of all time."
5,be kind rewind,be kind rewind was a very funny movie mos def and jack black are very funny together them making thoses movies was great i couldn't stop laughing i can't wait till june 10 for this to come out on dvd im going to buy it if you haven't seen be kind rewind see it or when it comes out rent it or buy it its good for a good laugh
3,"Bright spots, but mostly slow","The premise seems perfect for someone like Jack Black: remake all the major movies of the last few decades with no budget. True enough, remakes like ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Rush Hour 2"" are funny, but these are just a few bright moments in a slow-moving film. The purpose of the Fats Waller subplot is never really shown to be that important. Danny Glover's thrift/video store doesn't seem real enough (in today's market, who really still rents VHS movies anymore?). Still, the concept is a good one, and there are great performances from Jack and Mos here. It was one of those films you see once and never have to (or want to) watch again. An easy way to spend the afternoon, as long as you don't have your expectations too high."
1,Absolutely horrible,"This movie only brought out a couple of chuckles from me. For 102 minutes, this movie just kepting dragging on and on and I just wanted it to get over with. If I could, I'd give this movie 0 stars.I just wished I would have done some research before purchasing this DVD."
2,NEEDS A BETTER OPENING,"I tolerated this picture for about a half hour and then tossed the disc up into the air and blew it into tiny pieces with a ten gauge. It simply wasn't funny enough and seemed to be trying to mix a serious piece about ""Fats Domino"" and then bring in Black Jack humor. There were some other big names in this film so it must have started off well enough but something got lost upon the way. Slow start, too. It needed more gags or other funny moments or is it not a comedy? CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; STORY/PLOT POINTS: B minus; COMEDY: F; WHEN WATCHED: 12/02/2010; MY GRADE: D plus."
1,Too Bad You Can't Give Zero (0) Stars,"This movie had so much potential to be hilarious. It was never once hilarious, even with Jack Black in it, and I turned it off around three-quarters of the way into it. This movie never elicited a chuckle out of me, and the concept of the movie was nonsense: a VHS store that loses all of its recordings due to someone being magnetized? Good God.Save your money and skip this altogether. It's not even worth the rental, it's just that bad."
1,Warning: Not fit for children or adults,"Some people seem to think that funny and stupid are the same thing. SORRY, this movie is just plain stupid and not the least bit funny. Like several other reveiwers of this movie, I was not able to sit all the way throught it. PLEASE do yourself a favor and avoid this movie as if it were the plague."
1,Incredible cast but...,With such a great cast I expected a real winner. I was actually excited to sit down and watch this movie. About a quarter of the way through my wife exited saying she didn't like it. I held out for another 20 minutes only to regret it. This movie is a real waste of time. The execution and story line is very weak. I never saw the end and have no desire to do so. I expect a comedy to have at least a few laughs. This reminds me of some amateur youtube type stuff. Skip this and watch ANYTHING else with Jack Black.
1,why did they make this movie?,this movie is terrible. It would have made a good 30 minute TV show - maybe. Don't waste your time or money on this turkey.
1,Horrible Movie,One star is one too many. This movie deserves a negative rating. That is one hour and 37 minutes of my life that I will never get back. Please don't waste your time.
4,A Fun Piece Of Feel-Good Fluff,"This is a silly but harmless fun piece of fluff, guaranteed to put some smiles on your face and give you somewhat of a feel-good feeling when it's over. I'm sure that was the intent, and very little more. It wasn't made to astound anyone or provide huge laughs. Yet, it has a lot of charm and subtle humor.It's a ludicrious story, so you just can't take anything seriously. The premise is unique: two guys converting a dying video rental store into a success by taking blank tapes of famous movies and making their own 20-minute versions! The new ""movies"" are so bad, they're good and the neighborhood starts making requests and renting them like hotcakes. Goofy? Sure. Tons of plot holes? You bet......but a nice movie.In additon, Jack Black, Mos Def, Danny Glover and Mia Farrow were all fun to watch.It's no award-winner, but you could do a lot worse."
4,Delightful Film,"Story was really cute, shot well. Acting was FANTASTIC - the actors really expressed what the director was going for. I liked Mos Def before, but I REALLY liked him in this role. It was a different kind of film for Danny Glover, but he did well. Strange casting for Mia Farrow, but if I forget all the films she's done before then it works well. Really good choice for Jack Black - to stretch him out of the rut he was starting to dig - still similar to previous work, but enough different, and out of the primary roll to balance Mos Def's great performance.Rather inspiring for aspiring filmmakers. Like a fantasy that has become part of reality - the lights don't sparkle as brightly, and maybe the colors are a little dull, but it's REAL. Exactly what I've come to expect from this director."
3,"Not too funny, but heartwarming","I watched the movie just hoping it would be entertaining and I would get a few chuckles. What I got was just that and a little more. What I was not expecting was a movie that had alot of heart in it and made by people who care alot about people. Being a person that loves films, I thought it was a great that the people in the movie loved the films for what they were and saw the creativity in what Jack Black and Mos Def were doing. That was the point that stuck with me the most in this movie. Don't expect this movie to be a laugh out loud comedy, watch it for the meaning behind what should be important to everyone."
1,Flimsy and Transparent.,"I bought these ""poop"" bags after reading Lee's review. They are exactly OPPOSITE what he describes! They are see through and very, very flimsy. I do NOT recommend these."
3,"Sturdy, Standard size, Handy Dispenser","This pop-up dispenser works well and is very convenient to keep on our patio.The bags are sturdy and a smidge thicker feeling than the standard blue bags, however I wish they were just a little bigger.I would also like to see a refill pack made for this dispenser so it can be recycled.[...]"
3,Not Quite!!!!,"I haven't had to order these in about 3 years. My order from Amazon arrived and the quality of the bag, while average, just wasn't what it used to be when I first started purchasing these bags. The bag is a much thinner bag, but gets the job done! I can go to a local chain pet shop and pick up the identical quality for less money w/out shipping."
2,Hey is for horses and so are these,"Bought these for a couple of medium sized dogs. I could pick up their poop for a week in the same bag. It's a terrible waste of plastic and they aren't even environmentally friendly.Product description says ""Refill bags fit any standard dispenser."", however I could only fit a single bag inside of my bags-on-board dispenser and that was squishing it into a little ball.If you have a horse, a great dane or a mastiff then you'll love these. Otherwise stick with a smaller bag."
3,"Strong playing, mediocre production","Vic Juris (guitar) and Dave Liebman (guesting on tenor and soprano saxes) sound fine, but bassist/engineer Jay Anderson decided to bury himself and drummer Tim Horner in the mix. I'm guessing Anderson was trying for a mid-70's ECM sound, but forgot that on mid-70's ECM recordings you can clearly hear the rhythm section. I can't argue with the music, though: the band is tight and swings hard on a set of Juris' originals and thoughtfully re-arranged standards. Four stars for the playing, two for the production."
4,A Companion Piece,"When used in conjunction with Roald Dahl's written works, Tales of the Unexpected is a worthy collection of macabre videos performed by a surprising cast of notable actors; however, without pre-knowledge of the plots and their details, the stories may be looked upon as dated, ""cheesy"" attempts to imitate more popular series like Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Twilight Zone."
3,another item from the library,"...and another item i'm GLAD i got from the library...i liked the episodes, but for people who are'nt fans of the show, and are just passersby, i'd keep passing...the premises are boring at points, definitely not something you'd want to push out to the english, which have a total of 4 channels...keep on going..."
3,so-so series,"Excellent casting and great stories introducing by Roal Dahl himself. But it's not a great show. The direction and the pace sometimes is not the proper one. So, as i uually say it's the typical show you enjoy on TV when you have nothing else to do but not the one I woud buy on DVD to see again and again over the years."
4,An Excellent Series,"I first enjoyed Tales in the late 70's and early 80's. After years of searching I found the recently released DVD version. Admitedly, the shows are dated (anyone seen Man From U.N.C.L.E. lately?) but like the aforemention, it is still fun to watch. The Roald Dahl intros are great and the Tales leave you hanging to the end.For those of you who intrigued by the title, this is not a Twilight Zone or Outer Limits style show. It is a normal storyline with an ""Unexpected"" twist at the end.If you don't want to take a chance, go by Dahl's short story book by the same name."
3,Stories of stories,"Accomplishing the ""twenty spine chilling tales"", an Australian-produced five-DVD set presents, according to producers, a cream de la cream of the Dahl's stories-tragic, deceptive, ambiguous events depicted by a strongly hilarious way.It is good for watching in-between something more educative and mind-broadening."
5,One talented family,"A very heartwarming story about a hardworking and talented Irish-Catholic family. The travels and travails of the Burkes as they rehearse and perform across the country during the turbulant decade of the sixties against a background of racism and Vietnam, is a nonstop adventure for the reader also. The book brought back many memories for me personally as my family also traveled in the sixties in a 64 Chevy Belair wagon-but we only needed one! The story just goes to show how much has changed since that era. Or has it? An outstanding story-Highly recommended."
4,Meant for women who are slim,The panties arrived on time and were well packaged. I personally have no complaints with these panties but did notice that these panties are not made for women who are full figured or have slightly large legs since they do fit quite snuggly around the legs. They also tend to roll down around the waist.
3,LAMPS,VERY ATTRACTIVE LAMPS........BUT THEY GO ON AND OFF ON THEIR OWN AND HAVE TO BE MANIPULATED TO GO OFF MOST OF THE TIME. IF WE HAVE THUNDER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT MY LIGHTS GO ON AND SCARE YOU TO DEATH..........IS THERE A WAY TO CORRECT THIS???
5,A Fine Lamp,"I was looking for a nice, simple brushed silver touch lamp. I'd a had a hard time finding one. This one takes pretty much any wattage you want. I put in a 40 watt one just so it wasn't too bright at night. Works and looks great."
1,ADS sucks,"I bought this due to reviews. What a mistake--I have worked for over a week, burned many many DVD's and none have been able to play. The software causes shutdowns, freezes, and misup, plenty of varying error messages. I even had to reinstall Windows XP. This is a lot of trouble and will drive you nuts. I suggest other products, stay away from ADS Technologies' USB Instandt DVD. It is neither instant nor is it DVD!"
2,"gets hot, works but software not-so-good","same as above:I've had it for about two months have dubbed some twenty of my VHS tapes. While I can capture fairly easily the moviefactory 3SE is lacking(software/driver updates applied)I get better results with Nero.and often the resultant DVD's are coasters,,,for no obvious reason.I've also begun using the Plextor m402u capture-X,,,much better product,runs cool for a few dollars more.same !@#$ software(studio 8, ugh!). But other software is included."
4,Engaging,"I enjoyed the book, but truly it could have been better edited -- the first 100 pages were repetitive -- it felt like the literary equivalent of the film, Groundhog Day: endless returns to the inset-format commentary, rendered by the same store clerks, until I wondered what lesson I was supposed to learn in order to exit this torture. The first three or four times, their opinions were refreshing, not the twelfth or fifteenth. Other than that, I loved the characters. Yet I fail to see what the problem was: Jeannette and her clientele loved the store; her father threw money at her to keep it thriving, and even her wealthier customers offered financial help. So why did it fail? That remains a mystery. Intriguing."
4,Nice little story,"I always enjoy books about books or bookstores. This one was pretty good.The writing style was refreshing and did not go into too much useless details about the book business (i.e. financial aspect,etc).I was amazed at all that was accomplished by Jeannette Watson and thought the book was very interesting.A great read for all who love to browse bookstores and ever wondered about how they came to be."
1,terrible,"really bad editing...a poor excuse for a book about a bookstore...uninteresting, bland, and about the rich!"
1,This book is misrepresented,"The editorial reviews proclaim this is the story of Jeanette Watson, IBM heiress, daughter of TJ Watson (founder of IBM) and her personal bookstore. The problem is Jeanette K Watson Irwin, daughter of TJ Watson I, actually died in 1970, seven years before this Jeanette Watson opened this bookstore. I know this because I know Jeanette Watson's daughter. Something here doesn't add up."
4,An excellent Essay,"Ms. Auerbach takes the reader back to the Victorian ages through the medias of art and literature to examine the image of the female during the period. She portrays the image of the female as ""Mythic"" - that is, as very broad and also very powerful, effecting the entire age and the ages to come. She discusses such works as Svengali, The New Magdalen, and the artistic works of Rossetti. Her thesis is basically that during the Victorian Era there was a sort of ""crisis of faith,"" and the image of the woman stepped up to replace the ideas held by religions, thereby becoming angelic or demonic. The book is well written, thought provoking and informitive in its presentation."
5,classic 80's movie,"good price,quick shipping.80's classic,with a life lesson of sorts. Ending could have been better. Nice watching stars in their younger days."
2,Don't Buy.,I gave this two stars instead of one because it was sturdy and came with a glass shade. It is painted not plated. Not metalic. The paint was very very poor quality. Spots were missing paint. There was a scratch. Paint had rubbed off on the packing materials. Looks like a $10 used lamp rather than $100 new. Came packed in crumbly styro so ended up with mess in Living room and no practical way to return it.
2,Beware reviews.,"After reading the reviews I felt assured this was actually just a copy of 1984. Upon receiving the book today though, I was bewildered to find that it was more of a cheat-guide to the novel and not the novel itself. I'm not looking to write an essay, I just wanted to read 1984 again.. So this book serves no purpose for me."
1,Poor fit,Could not get the product to fit properly. Bought for my shoulder and could not keep it in position.
2,Where is the heat?,"I read the handful of reviews that complained about the lack of heat in this product. I decided to take a chance. When it was delivered I couldn't wait to try it out. I have pretty bad arthritis in my left shoulder and thought that if this worked it would be wonderful. Amazingly comfortable once I got it secured onto my shoulder, it was nice and taught all around.After trying the 3 levels of heat I was amazed at the lack of heat. I also noticed that down the middle of the heat pouch is a 3-inch wide seam. It feels like there are heating elements in there but there is little-to-no heat felt in that area. That is especially where I would like to apply heat.Absolutely, do not throw away your old flat heating pad, as they say in the Product Features section .. you will want it back after using this thing.Needless to say I'm sending it back. My disappointment in this product is giving off more heat than it does."
1,BAD saler,"This saler cancel my order without notice me, no matter what is their reason, no salers should be allowed to act like buyer, however, I didn't received any responce from Amazon after I report the saler's act."
5,"Great to take on Planes, Trains, and Automobiles!",These are the greatest things! My son 11 and daughter 7 will play with these in the car for hours! I just put them in a Tupperware container for each of them and take them everywhere! Even at home they keep them busy trying to out do each other! Wonderful for airplane trips also!
1,Horrible Product!,"This product is awful! So dangerous to have around your house! Although the manufacturer lists choking hazard, it does not list that swallowing the product could cause death! The magnets have a tendancy to come out of the rods with play and become only the size of peas, very easy to lose and get into the hands of a young child or pet. If the magnets are ingested in the body, they can connect together inside places such as the colon and cause a blockage that could kill an individual. This happened here in Seattle to a little boy. Do NOT purchase this product if you have young children or pets around at all."
5,"Tempting even for ""older kids""","I bought this for my 7 y.o. son, but he's had to share it with his older brother and sister, who seem to have a lot of fun with it.The idea of adding on by buying more sets is also a good one.Definately worth the money!"
2,Fun but leaks - go with the regular Socker Boppers,"These looked like fun and we ordered a set to go with a set of regular socker boppers. One of the sword either arrived with a leak or developed one in the first 30 minutes of play between our 5 and 7 year olds. I don't know if it is the extended construction of the ""blade"" or just a defect, but very disappointing.During play, the swords tend to be a little too ""gentlemanly"" compared to the boppers.If you have kids that want to hit each other, go with the regular socker boppers. They are much more satisfying and have every indication of being more durable. Smashing success at party for first grade boys."
4,Doc Smith did believe in leaving his readers breathless!,"So, here we are in Skylark three and everything is bigger, better, and badder. Doc Smith did believe in leaving his readers breathless!Richard Seaton is still fighting off his arch-enemy, DuQuesne, and is now also fighting off the Fenachrone. It is a good thing that he has some new allies.The fact that this book was written over 75 years ago does show in places, but the problems with this datedness are not overwhelming.I recomend the book."
1,Avoid This Edition,"I was attracted to the Aegypan edition of Skylark Three by the vintage cover art. When the book arrived, however, I was very disappointed by the poor print quality. The text throughout looks like it was run off on an old dot-matrix printer that was nearly out of ink. You'd get better resolution and contrast reading it on a PC or PDA. I'm kicking myself for not having ordered the Bison Books edition, which Amazon indicates is still avaiable--and is cheaper, too. Will probably end up returning this poor copy."
5,Gonzo forever!,May the ghost of Hunter S. Thompson come down and become the next President of the United States - and may Ralph Steadman be his Art Director!
4,Artisticly written,"Being both a fan of Ralph Steadman and Hunter S. Thompson this book was well written, and goes deep into the dark drawings that most can't come close. The minds of these two individuals are bizarre which make it even more enjoyable when these two were together. The art and the words combined are amazing. Ralph Steadman's work is presented very well."
5,Gagga over Gonzo,"A comprehensive collection for fan's of the gonzo artist, filled with stories or explanations that accompany each piece. Very satisfied"
2,Cheap Leather,"Although in the picture it looks nice, the leather is actually very cheap and very thin. I doesn't seem like it will hold up for long. The metal parts are nice, but the leather is of too cheap quality. I might just have it re-wrapped."
4,Good humorous erotica for almost everyone.,"This book was given to me as a graduation present. It was the first erotic book I have read, and I am quite pleased with it. The idea of a flea who lives in a girl's private parts telling the story is quite novel, and the story is very humorous and erotic. It was interesting to see how many men the girl(s) can have intercourse with, and how. If you haven't read erotica before, this book is a good starting book."
1,"primitive, bad, cheap","I really like erotic literature, but this book is just very flat and primitive: chapter after chapter a 14-year old girl is raped by the priest, the uncle, the neigbour, the farmers (of course she learns to enjoys it): this is not erotic, this is just cheap and ordinary porno.I don't even believe that this was written in the last century: they must have had better taste then."
3,uhh it was good enough,First of all this gun looks good. But the plastic on the gun like the stock tends to get a little shaky and you can feel the cheap plastic. Also the lower reciever is plastic. I loved this gun at first but there always seemed to be a problem whether it was the battery lasting for a very short time to the gun not taking in bullets from the magazine. So I took it all apart took the parts I could scavenge and saved them for the new ak 47 im getting. I will modify that one too shoot over 500 fps and reinforce everything.
3,i cant think of a title,"First off this gun is strong. its not 380 fps with .2s but its around 300. once you sight it in its pretty acurate, but the thing is, its almost too powerful for its design. on full auto it will slide down into semi. i figured, ok if i duct tape the selector switch itll be fine. i ended up stripping the selector switch. i sent it back and they replaced it, after seven weeks. this new one came today and it works, but the pin for the mag release keeps rattling out of place and falling out. not a big deal but still it shouldn't happen. if your looking for a gun withpure power this a good one, other than that, it kinda stinks."
3,"Alright weapon, but definately not 380 fps","This gun is a DECENT gun. However it is not the uber sniper rifle airsplat makes it out to be. While airsplat is a decent company, this gun has been improperly labeled as at 380 fps w/ .20. In reality it shoots about 310 fps. My friend owns this rifle and we tested it, it shot about 25 feet short of my AGM M14 AEG which is 330 fps. So please keep in mind, it is a very good weapon, however the fps is not as advertised."
3,"Not really a kid, but anyway. . .","First off, the gun did not ship with the advertised 250 high cap magazine. The magazine that it came with, held 30 or so BBs, and was broken, which caused 2 BB's to shoot out at a time on semi-auto, reducing the FPS to way below the 350 mark. It could barely shoot through a piece of paper. I did order a high cap magazine seperately, and that fixed the problem, but the gun still seems underpowered. The gun itself, had many scratches, and peeling paint on it.The screw, which kept the bipod from moving around, fell out very soon after I took it out of the box. Also, the plastic hop up adjustment knob, broke off very easily, so I have to use a screw driver to adjust the hop up now. The gun does seem to be pretty accurate, however.All in all, the product seemed to be more of a dissapointment. I don't plan on buying from the seller again, especially since there was a label on the box which basically bribed me to give Hot Import Toys a 5 star review."
2,Not Good,"Okay, so I got this gun last year, it broke after about a months use. People say its accurate and yes it is, but not any more accurate than a regular AK47. I took it apart and the inner barrel(the one that actually matters) was shorter than the one I had in my other AK. The barrel was also made of a cheap material, and as I was taking it apart I noticed there were huge weights in the hand grips, not cool. Its basically a normal AK put into a SVD shell, I would not recommend buying this gun. If you want a good ak look up the DBoys AK74. That was the best AEG I bought next to the JG Vietnam M16. One More thing is it is definitely not 340 fps, Ide say its more like about 250-300.Boyi D-Boys Kalash AKS74U Airsoft RifleJG M16A1 Vietnam AEG Airsoft Rifle with Full Stock - Black"
3,Amusing and bombastic view of the Martial Arts,To be taken with a grain of salt. The writing style is vintage 50's complete with slang. Philosophy is good but the author/s have a inflated opinion of themselves. If a quarter of the information is true then there is some merit. Worth reading once for entertainment value.
4,2yo quickly learned to recognize numbers,"My son received this toy for his 2nd birthday. He quickly learned to recognize numbers with the ""find the number"" game. It will last him a while because there is at least one more game for him to grow into. It doesn't hold his attention for hours or anything like that, but he keeps coming back to it. I have since bought the shapes/colors and alphabet Talking Sticks too. The screen could be bigger, but it's a nice hand-held toy. A little tip for moms who complain the volume is too loud - I read another mom say she covered the speaker with clear tape and that helped!"
3,"Its OK, can be better",Works fine for now but has very low amperage 2.something compared to the original laptop cable which is rated at 7 amps.
2,Not as advertised,"I use stickers as rewards for kids at work and when I look at a description that says LARGE ROUND stickers I expect what anyone would expect, something 2-3"" in diameter. What I got was pages of stickers about the size of my thumb. They are cute but by no means are they LARGE."
3,Strangely sized,"This fridge is too big for my barbie sized dollhouse, but too small for our play kitchen. The door sticks and you have to pull it to open it. That said, it is a cute little toy and my 19mo. daughter plays with it."
1,Don't bother,It showed up and it was worn on the sides by the package.... disappointed... The one star was a gift...
1,shift knoob,this thing sux it only has one screw and when thighten up it shifts and moves around dose not hold on tight
2,Sent Back,Old stock.I sent it back Amazon was quick to credit my account.Happy with service from Amazon on this order
1,Disapointing,"Looks cheap(wood is not impressive at all; a much lighter color, and looks nothing like it does in the picture), looks used, and dirty. Very disappointing"
4,Great Book for any Level of Ceramics,"Great book for any level of ceramics. This book has good information, images and provides background information on techniques and how ceramics evolved."
4,A great toy...for a while,"I really liked this toy when I first got it. It's a great toy but after a while they ended up at the bottom of mine and my brothers toy box. I guess maybe because were older, it sounds sutible for younger kids. But when I bored I do play with it."
4,Recommended,"A wonderful read. Funny, entertaining and informative to the world of bellydance. However, how many times in one book can someone tell you they're half-Lebanese. It's kind of like a Kathy cartoon - WE GET IT ALREADY!"
3,I don't think she ever got better. And repetative too,I couldn't aspire to ever want to be here nor understand her memoir. And perhaps we weren't suppose to.I enjoyed her dry wit but she goes on WAY too much about her insecurities as a half-lebonese and in the end still has no identity. So just how did BD help her? Glad she had a few good times. Thanks for sharing your story but I won't be reading it again.
5,Don't Give Up......DANCE!,"Ms. Soffee's tale is about too much more than fits on the front cover--it's about family and recovery, about time and maturity, about finding a voice and using it. Bridget Shcmidget--this ain't that at all! (and if you think it is you got another think coming) I like this book a lot. It is on my bookshelf and there it will stay.What really shines through this book is the presence of culture--whether the trash hip culture of the tattoo artist and his 'too hip' friends or the lebanese culture of her family or the belly dance culture--all handled with affection and verismo.My only problem here is that I gave away my copy and the bookstore is all out. Now where could I order one.....? (my bookshelf is complaining about the empty space)"
4,Fresh Voice,I am just so relieved to finally find an author who sounds like me and thinks like me. It is about time publishers look at manuscripts of early-30s women who have lived a life!
4,HILARIOUS!!,"A great light-hearted read for anyone who has known heartbreeak, or even if you haven't! Although it is not necessary to know how to belly dance to enjoy this book, it does give the reader an ""insiders"" view of what it must be like and the joy that it can and does bring. I would give it two thumbs up!!"
2,a few nuggets but very disappointing,"Twenty years of doing interviews, one year of time off to write, and we get THIS book? Where are the interview quotes? Where is the meat? Where are the diverse human personalities of voices other than the author? I borrowed this from the library and read it in an hour. There are a few nuggets in the chapter on spiritual direction, but the Cowley monks in Cambridge recently printed another version of that chapter in their magazine which is as good as this whole book. Read that and Alan Jacobs' The Narnian if you want good new stuff on Lewis. But best of all, skip the biographers and just read Lewis himself, especially the Letters."
1,A Kid that Hates Peacemaker,"I thotally hate peacemaker it copied off of samurai x. that show was wwaaay better than this it copied so bdad i mean look it has kenshin and saito and that okina guy with th mustache. people don't buy this buy kenshin the original samuraix from warner bros. it's better than peacemaker where thoers no peace because theyre fighting what the heck title? also, samrai kenshin is only good japanese cartoon everything else is gay. japan is gay. statci shock and pokemon from america and loney tuunse are beter. i'm gonna play soccer now. bye."
5,It stands upon its own,"Evidently, the reviews for this series have turned into a debate over the relative merits of this series and of the Kenshin saga. To tell you the truth, I bought this series because this (and the Mutsu saga, which I adore) got me interested in the period around the Meiji Restoration, and this was just more food to fuel my like of the characters and the period. It really didn't occur to me that our hero Tetsu is the future Kenshin--jeez, I'm confused enough that I thought Kenshin fought on the other side--but that's mostly immaterial. This has good humor, good character interpretation, and a nice mix of violence and thoughtfulness. I reccommend it on its own. Please note that I'm a simple guy who doesn't notice if a show has too much CGI or if an English dub is any worse or better than trying to parse it in my (weak, but extant) Japanese. Have fun and watch it."
5,"Great Card, NOT FOR ENTRY LEVEL GAMERS","-Ignore the first two previous reviews, idiots who are entry level gamers as tey didn't know knpw what the heck they were buying.-This card is a great Graphics card that can provide all you need for heavy-mid-entry gaming. Note I didn't say basics becasue this card is enormous as it WILL (not maybe) nudge your hard drives if your using an HP or Dell internal computer format.Secondly, this card requires a 300-400W power supply to function at it's sub-zero temprature so that is another reason it IS NOT for basic gaming or basic use."
1,Grrr,The item I received did NOT have the same interface as the picture which was very annoying because I was looking at the picture to see if it would fit my card slot and it won't! I did not get what I thought I was getting and am very disappointed.
1,CAUTION - DDR2 memory on this card,"There were some confusion in terms of the memory for this product. I just received mines today and it's clearly stated on the box as DDR2. The specs were correctly listed at a competitors site, and the manufacturer. Will be returning mines of course..hope this helps"
1,got wrong card,I can not review this item because although this is the one I ordered it is not the one I got.
4,Silverado rh mirror power heated,"Mirror looks just like the original, but not of the same quality, everything fits well when you install it bolts and wiring, but when you hit the highway and its a bit windy the lens tends to shake a bit, more than the original. For the price though its well worth it compared to the dealer in Canada."
5,From Elaine in Michigan,"I really liked your references to mindfulness and being present. I think it's particularly important for the elderly who in so many ways become increasingly invisible to a lot of society, especially those in nursing homes. E.C. LMSW, medical social worker."
2,"A nice pickup at a garage sale, but not at retail.","I bought this CD knowing I wasn't getting much (I only bought it for The Rock and Hangar 18 (I don't count the RJD2 track, or ""Take No Chances"", I already have those CDs), and the DVD, but the merchant I bought it from dicked me out of that part), so I wasn't very disappointed, this CD blows. In my opinion, Aesop Rock and Hangar 18 really make up Def Jux, with RJD2, Mr. Lif, and El-P being merely groupies. Of course, that leaves eveyone else to not even be mentioned. Overall, this CD almost makes you not want to pick it up, it seems so distant, like it doesn't want you included. Just as the cover reads: ""'Cause Motherf*@$ers are Bored"", it seems as though this compliation wasn't all that well thought out, even Aes' original track isn't his 'best'. The Hangar remix is a nice one and some other tracks are OK at best (i.e. ""Medical Aid""), but all in all, this is a CD that can be used to put a few tracks on your xbox, then returned."
4,impressive,"the latest installment of the definitive jux roster is back, and in some regards better than ever. this one is easily better than djxp2...better beats and lyrics. contrary to other reviews...i think el-p did a nice job with his lyrics and beats...but i feel aesop rock has fallen off a bit with his wordplay; although i sense it more in his voice and delivery. gems of the album for myself are tracks 7-9...homesickness is just absolutely ill, with devil in the hole's hook very catchy and nice. i would have given this album a 5 but without cannibal ox i just can't."
4,pretty good,"i was disappointed by Aesop Rock, El-P and the rest. but Def Jux's new commers make this CD worth its every penny (Hangar 18, Despot)"
4,A Real Review,"Sigh, can you really compare El-P's new cd to this release? No, because one's a jazz album, and one's hip hop. Now that that is out of the way, I have to say i think the opposite of ""Donn Ronn"" the idiot. I've seen almost every def jux artist in concert, new and old, and must say the new artists defenitely aren't bogging this cd down. The tracks from Aesop Rock, Murs, and RJD2 and other def jux vets are awesome, and tracks from rookies like 4th pyramid, and especially hangar 18 are very dope. I think if there is someone bogging the record down it would be el-p himself. some of his lyrics, like the ones on WMR, aren't what you would expect to hear from el-p. Despite the occasionaly dull/cliche lyrics from camu-tao's collab with el-p, or on his joint as SA Smash, all the beats are awesome, and its overall a good taste of what's to come from def jux."
2,PHEWW. . . I DONT KNOW DOG. . .,"I gotta agree with an earlier reviewer (Donn Ronn I think) from Brooklyn. Def Jux 3 is frighteningly bad. If it wasn't for the Aes Rock track, and the track by Hangar 18, both of which are decent, this album would be f*#king hopeless. The newcomers aren't really showin us nothin. Its just alotta gums bumpin. This must be a throw-away album for El. Thats's the only explaination for the half-bakedness of it. He must have been too focused on High Water to put any real work into DJ3. I'm hoping thats all it is. Because, on the bright side, none of the Def Jux compilations have been that memorable. They've all kind of been these prompters for the solo releases, which are always better, so maybe the wackness of this album isn't anything to be worried over. I'll tell you though, I'm startin to get nervous."
3,Huge Def Jux Fan,"Although I love El-P's label & support most of what it does, this album is very imbalanced. The new artists seem like they're copying the other artists style/lyrics a little. There are some really good tracks on here. True I still have a few tracks to listen to & I usually like an album better the 2nd play but there were a few that I was totally disinterested in. There are some classic beats on here. I think El might be trying too hard to expand his roster. By the way, Def Jux 2...four stars, CanOx...four 1/2 stars, Fan Damage...five stars, Funcrusher +...PRICELESS."
3,Kristen Blake Women's Faux Persian Collar Wool Topper in Cashmere Blend review,"I am 5 ft 6, and I weigh about 115 lb, and I checked a couple of reviews before buying it. The previous reviews said that the size runs one size big,so I selected a smaller size (XS) instead of a Small size. However, i feel that it is still way wayyy too big for me (I felt that the XS was like a L-XL)for me. However, there is no doubt that the quality of the coat is nice and soft, but I wish that it would have fit me.For anybody who is around my size, think about it twice before getting it because you will end up returning it like me. I hope that this review will help you!"
4,Not a bad coat for the $,"I would definitely agree that this coat runs big in size. Definitely go with the smallest size in your range. The sleeves are long and it has a very generous cut to it. The removable collar is soft and silky and the coat is also soft and comfortable. It is lightweight but for the area I live that means it will probably get more use than it would have otherwise. I found it to be of a very nice quality, particularly considering what I paid ($25). Lots of nice little touches like the way the pockets are situated in the front of the coat (easy for slipping your hands in to keep them warm) and the satin lining around the hidden buttons."
5,nice quality for the money,"This a beautiful lightweight wool car coat. The persian collar is removable, but I figure I'll leave it on for now, and if it ever starts to get ratty-looking, I'll get rid of it. I believe that this will become my main winter ""work days"" coat (mild NC winters), good for all but the coldest days. Very nice quality for the money.The coat is sized quite large -- I usually am a solid medium, but I saw the other reviews about the sizing and ordered a small, which is still very roomy on me."
3,"Fascinating subject matter, but book not well constructed","As a person interested in Buddhism, I was fascinated by the prospect of reading a biography on a living female Buddhist master in English.I found the story of Master Cheng Yen to be engrossing. The language of the book was quite staightforward and easy to grasp. I did not have to struggle with hidden esoteric meanings.However, I was rather disappointed in how the book was constructed. The book was more of the author's travel diary than the biography of the master. Of the photos in the book, 9 contained images of the master and 14 contained the author. In addition, there were numerous photos and mentions of the author's husband, which I found distracting from the main point of the book.My thought is the 279 page book could be condensed in half and the reader would not miss anything important."
2,color comes off easily,"Nice collar but red color stained neck of my dog pink as he is white around the neck. Metal ring is too narrow therefore not easy to clip leash on and off. I save this collar for special occasion, not for daily walking."
3,Below expectations,"I have a few recordings by these fine gentlemen and value those recordings highly so I expected the same quality when I bought this CD. However, there is something wrong with the sound here (a bit as if the band is playing under a carpet) and there are clearly better performances out there of these brilliant compositions.I recommend anyone who wants to have Mozart's piano quartet no. 2 to buy the live recording with Brendel and the Alban Berg Quartet. It also includes a beautiful rendition of piano concert no. 12 arranged (by Mozart himself) for piano quartet."
4,A change of pace in the Menagerie,"The second in Robert King's continuation of Mollo's classic series, this book marks a bit of a shift in focus. All the old favorites, the Hog, the Rabbit, Papa, Karapet and so on are still prominent, to be sure, but this edition sees them joined in the upper ranks by King's new character, the lovely and talented Sophia the Siren, and details her efforts at improving the play of her most promising students.The effect of this is that the hands in this book are not as high-level as previous Menagerie books, nor is the play of some of the characters as sound as before (the Secretary Bird, in particular, seems to have all but turned into Walter the Walrus). But the humor and character interaction are still as crisp and entertaining as ever, and isn't that all we ever ask of the Menagerie?"
3,Well made but more like a cricket than a mantis.,"Got this for my 2 year old daughter after she fell in love with a live praying mantis and continues to be fascinated with them. While the product is very well made, I'm not sure I would have been able to tell it was a mantis if I didn't already know. It's not a big hit with my daughter; maybe for a slightly older child (or adult, heh) with a real mantis obsession it would be better."
5,Wonderful,This is one of the best collections I have watched in a long time. Very enjoyable. Great for wintery days when your stuck indoors.
3,The Pallisers,"The start of the series is rather sedate and well, very English in nature. As you proceed it picks up tempo and starts to get interesting. This alas does not last long and as you reach the last few episodes turns into a rather cliché sort story The morally strict father imposes this same rectitude on his sons and the eldest rebels. The young man knows he has the total love and support of his mother and therefore chooses to become a real S**t.The other son of course toes the line and becomes his father's favorite ect.I must admit I did not finish the seeing the last two disks maybe I'm being a bit too critical.The story is well filmed and it's like going to see a play at a local theater.."
2,Not a little disappointed,"I felt this was a very dull series. Disappointing in all aspects. Total waste of money. Terrible casting, especially of the male actors. Repeat again. Not worth the cost, maybe at one third the price."
3,SHOWS ITS AGE,"WHILE I AM A FAN OF SERIES OF THIS KIND, THE LACK OF SUBTITLES IS A DISAPPOINTMENT AS OFTEN I CAN NEITHER HEAR NOR UNDERSTAND DIALOGUE. SOUND REPRODUCTION IS NOT THE BEST AND THE FAMED ENGLISH ACCENTS ARE CHALLENGING. I KNEW THAT POLITICS WAS A SUBJECT MATTER OF SOME IMPORTANCE IN THESE STORIES BUT I LOST INTEREST AT TIMES BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF IT. SUSAN HAMPSHIRE AS LADY GLENCORA IS THE MAIN ATTRACTION FOR ME AS SHE IS SUPERB IN THE LEAD ROLE."
4,Madame Max...I want you!,"Buy this one for the acting and writing, folks. It's 1970's, so you don't get the slick production but you do get what's missing today...actual, real, professional actors! Imagine that. Talent. Not special effects. My, oh, my, they sure can't make one like this today because it doesn't need gimicks to trick the audience. Now, there aren't a lot of shots of country houses (but what there are are not bad) and it looked to me like most of the inside shots were in a studio, not on-site. But it doesn't matter because it is so well done. Oh, and I lost my heart to Madame Max...the sexiest woman alive! Only one flaw...the characters from America had blatantly English accents. Other than that, not a one!"
2,Let's Get Something Straight...,"Everyone who claims to be a poet is not a poet. Jewel and Ashanti should stick to singing. Derek Alexander is a pop and R&B songwriter at best. I agree with the reviewer who said that these are basically good, clean lyrics. Not RAP, though. Does Ricki Lake have a book club? if she does, it would be right up there near the top. This book is hardly ready for Oprah and too clean for Jerry. Derek, you are not a poet. I gave this 2 stars, because if you put the right music to some of these, I'll listen."
3,Something In Between,"This is like Shakespeare meets Will Smith. I actually liked it. It's not classic poetry, avant garde, slam, performance, or spoken word. It's not acid jazz, pop, hip-hop, or rap. I don't think it fits into any particular category. It's something in between. At least the pieces have meaning and make some sense. They have a Hallmark card type charm to them. People that I know who have read it either love it or hate it, but they all still have something good to say about it. Lovers of classic poetry should probably request it at the library if you are inclined to try it."
5,Wonderful Reading!,"After having finished 'Brainchild: Visions of a Blind Poet', I am extremely impressed with the author's depth and versatility. The insightful poetry ranges from passionate to insightful and provides a truly wonderful reading experience. The author's thoughts and emotions flow beautifully in a way that allows any reader to enjoy each piece. I highly recommend this book to everyone, whether you enjoyed diverse poetry or just superb writing."
3,Basic Econ book review,Book has alot of highlighting and written notes on several pages in the book and is very distracting especially when learning a new subject for the first time.
2,Didn't work for me,"As the previous reviewer mentioned, in real life these look a lot longer and more slender than they appear in the photos. Turns out they're not actually all that long (the size 10 I ordered was a touch shorter than my size 10 Cole Haans they were meant to replace), but they look long because they run quite narrow.That was the first problem I had: these run so narrow that I would have had to order an entire size up to fit into them, and by then the shoes perceived length would give the distinct impression of clown shoes.I also found the leather very stiff & uncomfortable. While they would probably be okay after some break-in, these were not (for me) a shoe I could enjoy right out of the box.After these were returned I tried the Bacco Bucci Troy. The Troys are amazing...more expensive, but among the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. This suggests to me that the Bacco Buccis made in Italy are of far superior quality than the ones made in China."
2,Grill Pro Patio Protector,The product is pretty cheaply made for the price. Bought this to protect the patio from grill and rust stains but the pad itself has drain holes in all 4 corners. We will see if it fixes the problem or just moves it to a different spot and also if it will last more than one season.
2,informative but off the mark,"Mr. Segev has written yet another history of Israel. THis time the topic is Israels first year in existence. He touches on such topics as; secularism vs. religion, settling the territories, arab lands, immigration. His argument is simple. THe Jews, having defeated the Arab in the 48 war, treat their neighboors badly while at the same time creating a theocratic state and encouraging Jews(who according to him were living peacefully with their arab neighboors) to emigrate to Israel. This book is very informative and well written but its argument is wrong. For a less biased account I would recommend ""From time immemorial"". For an account of the war read 'O Jerusaleum'. Segev does no justice to the heroics of the early Jews who built a strong state in the face of enemies, but he does try and substantiate Arab claims that they were forced off their lands(after murdering thier Jewish neighboors of course). Be careful with this book it is biased."
3,A Match Made in Heaven,As a lover of the Regency Romance genre I have to say that this author is not one whose style particularly appeals to me. I prefer the ones written in a lighter style with lots of witty dialogue.But this book was not bad in spite of the fact that Lady Sarah Mallory suffered from what appeared to me to be a mild seizure disorder that would manifest its self every time she was under stress of any kind. Luckily Viscount Dunnley had an overdeveloped protective instinct so you knew that this was a match made in heaven.The best character in the book was Viscount Dunnley's long time mistress Jani Brooks. During the first part of the book I was hoping that Dunnley would come to his senses and marry her but as the book progressed I realized that a Jani is far too independent and emotionally stable to marry a man like Dunnley.
4,Joseph knows AOR West Coast,"HI, im a professional DJ out of lansing michigan and i've listened to joseph many times and he is always one of the first people i suggest for airplay, his i am alive album features the goods with bill champlin and bobby kimball and just everybody on it, and although i hear alot of people say the songs arent that strong, i dont always agree with that, joseph understands the vocal range and sound he has and taps directly into the sound that made toto's farenheit and seventh one so popular, if you like the toto/chicago sound, you should own this, ""heroes"" and ""cool night"" being the best tracks, Thx, and happy listening!! James Martin"
5,West Coast All-Stars!!,"This cd reads like a West Coast All-Star lineup. People involved were: Jeff Porcaro (Toto), Michael Landau (Steve Perry), Jay Graydon (Airplay), Michael Thompson (Meatloaf), James Harrah (AOR), Mark Goldenberg, Mike Porcaro (Toto), Jason Scheff (Chicago), Steve Porcaro (Toto), Jay Gruska (Maxus), Joey Carbone, Paul Gordon, Lenny Castro (Pat Benetar, Alice Cooper, Toto), Bobby Kimball (Toto), Bill Champlin (Chicago), Donna Delory (Seth Marsh), Amye Williams, Katy Segal & Danny Peck. Joseph Williams is also the voices in the movie The Lion King. My favorites are Heroes, Unharm Your Heart, Out Of Harms Way, I'd Rather Dance By Myself. This cd is getting impossible to find & is out of print. Do not miss out if you can find it."
5,Great for creative reference,"The best thing about this book is it's so full of design patterns. Having the charts for colorful designwork is handy. So many books are full of the actual garment patterns, this one is full of the design patterns making it easy for the creative knitter to find a design and adapt it to whatever knitting project they choose. It's great for the experienced knitter, however, it may not be the best or most useful for a new knitter although, it's definately one for the new knitter to have in their library as inspiration and future use."
4,cute and fun!,This cute little toy is very fun to play with! an i am being honest. It can pick up things with its mouth and can pretend to drink out of the water bottle. it gets a little boring after a while with older children so buy the pet playhouse or more pets with it. i love it so much i bought a few other littlest pet shop toys and hope to collect more this christmas!
4,the cutest of the LPS bunnies...,"I bought this set because this paticular bunny is the cutest of the LPS bunnies. I liked the fru fru carrying purse, but wish it had been a matching color to the bunny's barrette or somehow seemed like it ""went with it"" more. This line of toys are very durable are cute, and are excellent for birthdays & holidays--these smaller sets would make great stocking stuffers. The set I bought did not come with the carrots, but that's a nice touch, I think. The LPS toys are cute & inoffensive (well PETA may have a problem with them, I guess...), and the magnet in the bunny works with other magents in other LPS sets. I did get the water bottle, which fits with the bunny in the purse perfectly, and would nice for a little girl to carry with her on plane or long drive."
5,Good buy for the money.....,I brought these tires to replace my old ones which were the same. They have a good life span & I love the ride. Price was very good.
5,Excellent Tire.....Nice Tread and Wire Bead for Safety,"With no 27"" tires available in my area, I ordered two Chen Shin C637's from Amazon. Standard delivery took a little over a week and the tires exceeded my expectations. I have come to prefer wire-beaded tires after having some scary problems with tire separation from the rim after rapid air loss. They are a little more difficult to install (a tire spoon is necessary), but once on the rim, they stay there. Nice tread pattern and rubber compound provide confidence in high-speed turns. Since it never rains here, I cannot vouch for stability on wet pavement. Bottom line: For twice the price, you could not buy a better tire !!!"
1,only lasted 1.5 months,"I always inflated this tire to 90 psi as specified on the tire. I bought it in March and now (mid May) it is already broken. There is a golf ball size bubble on it. I ordered another tire a few weeks ago, not sure if I will wait till it breaks as well or replace it right away. I live in Tucson and the climate and the bumpy residential streets here are admittedly pretty rough on tires."
4,Great for the price!,"My tires are rated for 90 psi - unlike mentioned by one post.They look great, and feel like a good quality. But the Bead was near impossible to seat on the rim of my bike (CR-18 27"" rim). I have had some difficulty with other Sun rims, but this seems like both the tire AND the rim were working against me...Tire works great; would buy again in a heartbeat."
3,Wrong Tire,"The tire I ordered was with a black wall, as pictured. What I received is a yellow/gum wall tire. It's not worth the hassle of returning it so I'm just letting it go. I purposely ordered black walled tires though, so that bugged me."
3,Good power wheel retread option,"THe 13.5"" diameter wheels on my kids power wheels are worn through. I am going to cut them in half and screw them to the wheels. 2 of these tires should take care of all 4 powerwheels wheels."
4,Fine tire for the price.,"It's cheap. It's a serviceable tire. (Mine were rated 90 lbs.) These arrived with no obvious defects, withstood the rated pressure, and roll nicely down the street. What more do you want?"
3,My Chen Shin C637 Road Tires,Again the delivery was prompt. The tires seem to be of good quality (considering the price). However I hoped they would be higher pressure I believe these tires have a max P.S.I. of 60lbs. I prefer a higher pressure tire. But if you are not a serious rider I`m sure these would be fine.
3,Okay,"Cheng Shin is a good city tire but I would not go Pro with it. All & all it's good tire, and dose what I need it to do and that's city ridding for Exercise. At Meijers you can get Schwinn tires which are much better then these, for a third of the price. a good tire but is ((WAY OVER PRICED)) I wish i would have seen this before I got these. As far as the seller go's, Excellent! and very timely. Only ((3 stars)) Because of the price gouging."
5,"Dark and Lovely Permanent Hair Lightener, Light Golden Blonde 384","I was very impressed with this product! It even included the bleach powder to add to the liquid solution. This product turned my almost black hair, the same EXACT color on the box!! WOW!! I will only use this brand from now on!!"
4,hair dye,"this took alittle longer to ship to us, but we was happy with the product, it turn my girl hair dark red, almost matches the box, but we was happy, but if they could ship faster than taking alittle longer so we might order from them again"
3,Requires bleach,"I've been trying to find a blonde hair dye for dark brown hair that doesn't require bleach- and I thought this would be a great option.Unfortunately, this only seems to work on bleached hair. :("
1,does not cover gray,"I do not usually buy hair color for women of color however, I thought since I am black that I would try the dark and lovely but I am going back to Garnier or Revlon. They cover gray."
4,Nice,I have not used this color on me yet but i really think it will turn out great it is a nice color
3,"Too much ""lonely heart""!","I wanted to give 2 stars, but then maybe some like Tschaikovsky's ""None but the Lonely Heart"" done to death. Both leads deserved a much better story and more variety in the music. OK if you're not expecting too much."
4,Well-made dish for kitty,I purchased this dish to enable me to heat up cats food when refrigerated. Excellent product. I gave it four stars because it was poorly packaged and one was damaged. Amazon took care of the problem immediately. Kitty loves his new dish!
5,"Finally, a USB to Serial Adapter that works!","I have occasion to program some business communication equipment that requires an RS-232 port. Try to find a laptop these days that has one of these! I have purchased two much more expensive adapters in the hope that they would do the job but they are worthless when used with these radios. Someone who owns a radio shop told me about these and, sure enough, they work perfectly! Less than half the price of the others I bought and it works so well I ordered another!"
3,Do you write? M or F?,Yes the voice is the story. (Read Yagoda's book The Sound on the Page if you really want to get into that idea). This book has many interesting interviews -- Timothy Findley has a few choice words. But what makes this book only averageis that it's less about writing and more focused on Kruk's obsession with gender differences. Every writer is grilled on this for pages and pages. Who cares.
5,blu-ray title,This is a must have blu-ray title. Reference video and audio transfer. I wish all blu-ray titles were this good.Recommend to buy.
4,Wonderful Concert,"If you're a fan...no more needs to be said. She's in really good voice. Clearer than it was in her first set of concerts. And she performs most of her classics with their original arrangements. Barbra seems more relaxed on stage than ever...at one point playing the piano, screwing it up and laughing about it.Definately worth having!"
5,STREISAND.....A TRUE LEGEND,GREAT 3 DISC PACKAGE......2 CONCERTS PLUS ONE DISC DEVOTED TO AN INTERVIEW. THE CONCERTS ARE ABOUT 10 OR MORE YEARS APART....SO ITS GREAT TO VIEW BARBARA IN 2 DIFFERENT SHOWS. OF COURSE SHE IS ALWAYS SUPERB AND CHARMING. IT WAS CUTE TO SEE THAT SHE TOOK HER HEELS OFF SOMETIME DURING THE MORE RECENT CONCERT- SOMETHING ONLY A WELL-WORN VETERAN WOULD DO.....SORT OF LIKE SINATRA COMING OUT WITH A CIGARETTE AND DRINK IN HAND. SHE'S A LEGEND....WHAT MORE COULD YOU SAY. HER VOICE ...SO BEAUTIFUL AND IN TOP FORM. YOU CAN FEEL THE EXCITEMENT IN THE AUDIENCE AND STAFF BEFORE THE SHOWS BEGIN....THIS WOMAN CAUSES A MAJOR STIR WHEN SHE PERFORMS....EVERYBODY THATS ANYBODY TURNS UP. A GREAT CHANCE TO SEE A TRUE DIVA DOING WHAT SHE DOES SO WELL. AS ONE FAN INTERVIEWED SAID ON THE ANAHEIM SHOW..'' YOU CAN JUST FEEL HER EMOTION''.........DONT MISS THIS ONE....
1,Unfair,I never got to see the DCD because it is Blu-ray...... and Amazon charged me a great deal of money to return it. Just like they charged me a great deal more for other DVDs....Last time that I will order from Amazon....ecb
5,great gift,we bought this as part of a 60th bday gift. she is a Streisand fan & loved adding this to her collection
5,Barbra Streisand: The Concerts,When I think about Barbra Streisand's voice I have to smile. She is such an extraordinary vocalist and one of my most favorite ever since she started singing for the public. I feel that I have a treasure owning this recording of Ms. Streisand. Thanks Amazon!
5,Love this set of DVD's,This set of 3 DVD's were an amazing value. 2 concerts and one documentary about the making of one of her albums. Barbra is so awesome and her voice is as beautiful as ever. The first concert was over 2 hours and kept me entertained every minute. The plus was that her son was in the audience and she sang a song directly to him. Simply wonderful. A must have for every Barbra Steisand fan.
4,Great Moments,"Especially interesting is the newer concert where Streisand is very relaxed and all about the music. Unfortunately, her voice has deepened and the wild ride slightly out of control upper register thrills are gone. I think the best moment is just Babs and the piano and 'Nobody's Heart'. She does a good job with 'My Shining Hour' but it's a shame she didn't record it when her voice was at its peak.On the whole, very enjoyable."
1,Wrong region,I bought this DVD and I was very happy to receive it quickly. I went home to watch it but it did not work. My PS3 from Europe gave me a message on my big screen that This DVD can't be played back on this machine. FYI I bought more then 20 music DVD titles and movies from Amazon.com and they all work fine. Even all my PS3 games bought from the USA work on my European PS3.
3,Printer,I received the printer very quickly after ordering. I received a functional printer that worked without any problems. My only problem was that this printer was advertised as being as clean as new but when we received the printer it was extremely dirty like it had just been pulled out of service.
2,Disappointingly HARD,"I reviewed TONS of baby pillows prior to purchasing this one. Boy did I make a bad decision! Primarily I wanted to buy a pillow for nursing, and I thought this one had added benefits of multiple uses (with the removable wedge and roll) and the price. I brought this to the hospital for my first breastfeeding session with my newborn, and it was absolutely terrible! The pillow is too overstuffed and awkward to position. If you want this pillow for nursing, look elsewhere (since then I have bought both the Brestfriend and Boppy -- LOVED the breastfriend for nursing, and the Boppy is good for tummy time & sitting up, good for BFing but not as good as Brestfriend).However this pillow is good to use with the wedge and support your little one sitting up. However I'd rather have the Boppy for that -- more uses and better looking, although pricier.I guess for these products, you really do get what you pay for."
2,"Product OK, Shipping was bad","I ordered this item ten days before the baby shower, on the Thursday before MLK day. They couldn't be bothered to ship it until after the holiday, on Tuesday. I inquired about it via email on Wednesday, asking when it had shipped. No one got back with me until after I had complained with Amazon several days later. The item finally arrived the day after the baby shower. It was embarrassing to not have the gift at the shower (which I was helping to host!). I am still trying, three weeks later, to coordinate with the mom-to-be to get the pillows to her. It is late in her pregnancy and she has lots more things to worry about than trying to find a time to meet up with me to get the pillows she should have been able to get at her shower.I will never again use an online registry for a baby/wedding shower. I would have been much better off walking into Target and buying something off that registry."
3,Get what You pay for,"Nice shorts but run about a size or 2 smaller, maybe should be considered SLIM. But fell right off had to resew then. Nice material though. A few minor adjustments and they are ok."
1,Is not what the description says,"I bought this set because it stated that it came with a stand bag. It does not-it comes with a cart bag. It wasn't even a shipping mistake, I had two sent to me. If you want the HiPPO brand, it is best to buy from someone else."
1,sas so,trash gsarbage. why does read this? not worth the time. just like goingto a sd rrsyutany. parfdon yyymy frech. where dd such sa sayng come fro?
1,Insipid book,"If you want a story that goes nowhere with glacier-like character development, this is it. The only thing that kept me slogging through this banal effort was the belief that something had to develop to justify publication. Incorrect. The basic cycle established in the first five or so pages became an endless loop for most of the book."
1,Not funny.,"Not funny. Not well written and worst of all cardinal sins in a book, boring. Mills went for something like a dark comedy, but came out with a dull, dreary book with lackluster dialogue, indistinguishable characters and an unfinished ending. Nuff said..."
4,Love it or hate it - I love it!,"This seems to be a 'love it' or 'hate it' book. The friend who gave it to me told me I could burn it when I was finished. I loved it!! Like a couple of other reviewers I laughed aloud while reading (not something I'm prone to do).Enjoyment of this book obviously depends on the type of humour you appreciate. It's for readers with a warped, wicked, weird, sick, black sense of humour. Australian reviewers seem to like it...."
3,Fast reading entertainment,"I bought this book because of it being shortlisted. It was funny and a fast read, but in the end it was disappointing, or shall I say the ending was a disappointment."
2,Left empty by the ending,"I loved All Quiet on the Orient Express by Mills but I must say I was disappointed by Restraint of Beasts. The characters were good but the ending was abrupt and without closure. I was even wondering whether the last pages were missing (unfortunately, no). It is a quick read so I don't feel it was a waste. Take from it what you can and then pick up All Quiet on the Orient Express."
2,The Restraint of Readers,"This is a story of three men who built high-tension fences for the restraint of beasts but found themselves under the restraint in the end. Editorial review speaks about black humor and promises that ""readers will remember this book and laugh, long after they have finished reading it"". Some events of the novel are rather black but it is a real slog to find any humor and I do not even smile during reading. The heroes are unattractive, the plot is predictable, the language is poor with perpetual insipid 'alright' and f-words.The real bolt from the blue is that the book was shortlisted for the Booker Prize."
2,Over-rated first draft with a weak ending,I could see where the book was going about 2/3 of the way through and was tremendously disappointed to find that my suspicions were correct. If it wasn't such a quick read I would have given it up earlier. The same raw materials in the hands of Tom Sharpe would have been better crafted.
1,Dazed and Confused,"With all the good things said about this book, I was more than eager to read it. However, I was dissappointed by the books inability to draw me in. I didn't care about the characters, and surely didn't find any humor in the situation. Also, the book has a half baked ending that is completely unsatifying. In a word I felt ripped off."
3,How to write a Prize-Winning Novel,"I wish I'd thought of doing it! Take two classic yet under-appreciated novels, extract the most compelling aspects of each, sandwich them together, and voilá, a brand-new novel from a brand-new talent, bound to attract the attentions of the literary establishment, and if you happen to be a bus driver, the broader media too, guaranteeing a best seller.The Restraint of Beasts shares with Flann O'Brien's brilliant ""The Third Policeman"", early death, followed by a consequent surreal, repetitive circularity of events and lack of final resolution. Paul Auster's ""The Music of Chance"" features two men forced into building an apparently endless wall for a pair of eccentric millionaires, who excercise complete control over them. Sound familiar?Though the book is worth a read, and contains some amusing moments, O'Brien's and Auster's are much more rewarding."
4,Hynotically compelling,"I have a weakness for dark comedies about average people just trying to get from day to day while retaining grasp of their pride and sanity, and this book fits into the surreal end of that category. The pace is slow, the action is monotonous, the characters lack insight into their own actions--yet I found myself far more engaged in a novel revolving around fence post driving than I ever expected to be. The languid predictability of day after day of work becomes hypnotic, until jagged reality asserts itself. An excellent afternoon's read."
4,What the ?????,"What a strange little novel! Deadpan tale of a fencing crew in rural Scotland... told from the POV of the reluctant crew boss, who is put in charge of two guys that are both a couple of tacos short of a combination plate... Incredibly droll, it nevertheless pulls you in with its perfect pitch... strange, dark-humored, odd... I was pleasantly confused for days after I read it. Quite enjoyable, although I'd hardly rate it a prizewinner. I look forward to his new one coming out in paperback."
4,Work and emptiness,"This simple, straight and gloomy book is a punch on the nose. It clearly blows down our faith in the post-Industrial Revolution rethoric that tells us that being a paid worker is the best we can get from our lives. Well, perhaps it's not. Perhaps we can end up getting a as empty existence as Tam and Richie got. And trying to fill it up with pints and pints of beer, as they do. I dare to say that, if Chaplin had had a nightmare the night before he conceived ""Modern Times"", he would come out with something quite similar to this little great book by Mills. I suggest you to buy it now and read it as soon as possible, so you can feel a bit more human, besides being a worker. But, if you've got to get back to work, give those two Scots a call later, because they might want to invite you for a pint or two."
2,More that needs to be revealed,"Didn't read it. Bought it just to prove a point that my account and internet activity was being monitored!US Intelligence agencies use and experiement with this stuff too. Try searching Amazon for more related topics and see what you get. Also, pick up the autobiography of J. Edgar Hoover."
1,They Buzz,"Everything is great about these speakers, except they have one fatal problem... they buzz. The speakers periodically emit a buzzing sound. This even happens when they are turned OFF, if you can believe it. I called Altec Lansing and they informed me that a) they are well-aware of this problem; b) it is ""normal;"" and c) this is to be expected with their ""less expensive models.""This problem is incredibly annoying and I am getting rid of the speakers. If you want to buy a pair, email me and I'll send you mine for free if I still have them.Do yourself a favor and get a different product."
5,Shows you what love is,"I first bought A Special Trade by Sally Wittman for my daughter in 1983, after hearing it being read as a graduation commencement speech by the senior class president of an exclusive private school in CT. Her aim was to encourage her fellow classmates to give back to society.My daughter is now 23 years old, a Yale graduate, and still has this book on her shelf among her favorites. It really does teach you how to love.Virginia White"
3,A bit disappointed,"Although I got what I asked for, I was a bit disappointed in the condition of what I received. The book had 4 or 5 spots where someone had colored in oranged crayon and the item was listed as ""Good"" condition. It wasn't quite my idea of good. The sender did write a note to go with saying it could be returned at their expense if not completely satisfied, which was a decent thing to do."
3,Dynomax 17317 Exhaust System,"The install of the system was straight forward and uncomplicated. I might add that the first system shipped lacked the muffler, so it was returned and a replacement arrived in another four days with all necessary parts for install. Quality of the system is okay but did not like the welded on exhaust tip. The factory welding process discolored the stainless tip which distracts from the appearance. The tone of the muffler is pretty subdued. Both the fore and aft exhaust pipes had big labeling stickers attached which took considerable effort to remove. Nothing looks better than having big old crusty-brown stickers baked onto your exhaust system! If I was to do it over again, I would of paid the extra money to buy a Gibson System."
3,"sturdy, but uncomfortable","I bought this shoe a full size larger than usual, and it was still tight. The leather is very strong, so it took a while to stretch it out a little. It is still rubbing the inside of my foot, so I can only wear them a little at a time. Otherwise, they look good and are very well put together."
2,Ugly but comfy,"I'm not sure where to wear this shoe; I'm not even sure why I bought it. Ok, it's comfortable but not beautiful at all."
1,hify,"this is a one of the best software which suits the network lan connection, which gives us full tension free lan connection. Thank You."
3,"fun to play with, but not all it claims","The tool is actually pretty fun to play with, but it is not all it claims. I read the reviews, and unless the ""tarot.exe"" connects to the web without using a dialer, that part of the tool does not work. The company is also out of business; another Seattle dot.com gone bust. If I had known that at the time, I doubt I would have purchased the CD. Basically, you get what you get. But with that said, it does have some nice features, like being able to create your own spreads and add text to the card meanings. For that it is worth the ... I spent."
1,prehistoric computer program - non functionall,"Old, old, prehistoric windows program not good above windows 95; definately not with vista......lost postage on return to vendor but original expence refunded"
3,"Too simple to be considered ""complete""","This book does show you basic lighting techniques. It also goes through all the things almost every other photography book does. If your are looking for original ideas this is not the book. This book cannot spawn creativity because it is far behind the photographic learning curve.The reader should note on this book (and all photography books) that this is a new edition not a new book. This seems to make a huge difference in the quality of photography books because of the learning curve I mentioned. Potrait (fashion, glamour, or anything besides landscape) photos taken two years ago, look out of date because they are behind the curve. How many people want to look at old tired photos? If you are one of them then you don't mind taking old tired photos and shouldn't read a book's review--- just buy the one with the 'coolest' photo on the cover."
1,Seductive cover...lacks useful info.,"The problem with most books about studio lighting - this book included, is that the author shows the resulting photos, the equipment used, simplistic diagrams but never any photos showing the studio set up with all the equipment in their respective places. I would recommend aspiring photographers look elsewhere for references that are truly useful rather than a pretty glossy picture book designed to seduce you to spend your money."
2,Very basic book,"I made a big mistake buying this bock, I should pay more attention to the reviews, the writer dose not go through details only big pictures with mentioning few general things, there are no satisfying details and diagrams."
5,Linda Howard out does herself with this book.,Linda Howard does an excellent job with the book. You immediately feel for the characters. Especially the two main characters even though they are seperated by time you feel as if they are connected. It is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it.
5,Okay...,"This is one of Linda Howard's boks that I like but not one of the best. I would rate this book 4 and 3/4 a star but since they don't have that option I chose five.In this Book the heroine, Grace St. Jone, she is well rounded and lives in a comfertable life. But that changes in a blink of an eye.First her husband and brouther are killed in front of her. Her boss sends goons after her to kill her and steel her work...that her boss gave her!Running for her life, and translating her work she runs into some unexpected friends.Hiding from your evil boss, and his friends, while tring to translate, would be hard. But going through a strang flash back to vist a sexy man called the Black Niell. Who also seenms to be writting to you from the past.I enjoyed this book. With all of Linda Howard's classic writting and awsome supportive characters. The ending was okay, the reason behind the last 1/4 missing of a star. But still worth recommending.Enjoy!"
4,HOT! HOT! HOT!,This book grabs you right from the start and takes you on a wonderful journey. I truly enjoyed the historical aspects of the book. Time travel stories are my favorite type of novels and this one ranks with some of the best. Highly recommended.
5,A must read,Son of the Morning is by far the most amazing romance novel I have ever read. Linda Howard makes her characters come alive and you actually feel their heartbreak and rejoice at their triumphs. This novel has a wonderful plot very different from most romance novels. Grace St. John is in no way a weak individual. And Niall is an amazingly dinamic character. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is tired of the typical romance novel. You will not be disappointed.
4,Good Romance Novel,"I usually don't read romance novels, but I picked this one up because I wanted to read something light over the weekend. I was very impressed. This book had a good story line, interesting characters, and even some suspense. One thing that I particularly liked about this book was that the heroine was not some young virgin waiting to be taught the ""ways of love"" by an older man. Overall, this was a pretty good read."
1,Cannot Force Myself to Finish It !!,"This is the worse book I've read in years !!! I'm half way through, and I have NO DESIRE to finish it. Have only gotten this far because I'm waiting for other LH books to arrive through the mail."
4,Breath catching!,Fantastic book as true of so many Linda Howard novels. I found myself holding my breath in anticipation many times! I will be reading this over and over again in the future. Loved it!! Only wished Grace and Niall got together sooner.
2,Not a good ROMANCE,"Linda Howard is usually one of the best romance writers out there; I must say that I was rather disappointed with her latest book. While it does portray a woman of extraordinary strength with courage etc., it also fails to make convincing the emotions between hero and heroine. They don't meet(in the flesh, so to speak) for way too long. Ms Howard's focus was definitely on Grace, not the relationship between the lovers, and I personally found that when they did meet, their love tended to be purely sexual. While I enjoy hot love scenes, it's certainly not to the exclusion of any of the finer feelings...I found this to be more a book about a woman discovering herself anew rather than a couple building towards a life together. I hope Ms Howard returns to her usual highly emotionally charged love scenes and close intimate relationship focus for her forthcoming work"
2,Son of the Morning,"As a long time Linda Howard fan, this is the first book I have ever wanted for it to actually end. This book, in my opinion, was hard to follow, hard to focus on, and really confusing. I would NOT reccomend this book. I will remain a Linda Howard fan, but this book will not remain in my large collection."
2,Not as Good as I thought it Would Be.,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. It sounded very interesting. The two stars is for the beginning. The start of the book was not bad. I felt for Grace and the loss of her husband and brother. Her life on the run was well written and exciting. The book took a nose dive when she decided to time travel. The whole experience was very unbelievable. I would not call Grace and Niall's relationship love, I would call it lust! Most women I know would never choose to go back to the 14th century to have their baby. Very unbelievable!!! If you want time travel, romance, adventure, and hunky Scotsmen read Diana Gabaldon's Oulander series. You will not be disappointed."
2,"Not a good story,","I did not like this book at all altho I am (as a rule) a Linda Howard fan. The story was stupid and I had trouble making myself finish it. Time TraveL Romance quite simply is not Linda Howard's edge (in my opinion), she should stick at what she does best and leave this genre to Roberts or another writer on the this topic."
1,Last Linda Howard I Buy,"I thought this book was absolutely dreadful.Grace loses the love of her life but immediately (days, weeks...) is having 'dream sex' with someone else? Oh wait - she did cry once, at the end.The whole reason Parrish is after Grace is moronic. You wait through almost the entire book and your still shaking your head. What? He wanted the 'knowledge'? Hitler makes an appearance? Satan?Where was the scene involving the kitchen sink? Then the great reveal of what the 'power' is.I found the answer so totally offensive that I couldn't believe what I read. Would the author feel she could use one of her books to grievously offend Muslims? Buddhists? Anyone else? Is it only Christianity that you can offend?Ms Howard is a Romance novelist. She should keep religion out of it.I have been on a Linda Howard kick. I have 2 more of her books coming in today, this makes 14. I'll be sending those back unopened. I'll be trashing the others.Too bad..."
4,"Touching, couldn't put it down, page-turner.","This novel was great. I couldn't put it down. The ending was a little flat, but I loved the story. I highly recommend it!"
5,I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS EXCELLENT.,"I HAVE READ ALL OF LINDA HOWARDS BOOKS AND THINK THAT SHE IS A SUPERB WRITER. I KEPT PUSHING ""SON OF THE MORNING"" TO THE BACK OF MY STACK OF BOOKS TO READ. BOY WAS I MISTAKEN. I ENJOYED THE MAIN CHARACTERS, EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T ACTUALLY GET TOGETHER TILL THE END OF THE BOOK. BUT THE SHARING OF DREAMS AND THOUGHTS WAS AWESOME, SOMEHOW ENCHANTING. LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE TIME TRAVEL BOOKS FROM MS. HOWARD. THIS WOMAN CAN REALLY WRITE. THIS BOOK LEFT ME WANTING MORE."
3,Exhausting!!!,"I had read some of the reviews before starting this book and based on those, I was ready for a great book. Unfortunatly, I was a little disappointed. Linda Howard is so descriptive and makes you feel like your right there in the midst of the story. However, I felt this book was too long and spent too much time describing and re-describing details that weren't all that important to the storyline. I did enjoy the second part of the book better, the last four chapters made reading this book worth while."
3,Great but takes a long time to get there!!!!,"In spite of the three stars I liked this book. The only trouble was that I had to skim three quarters of it to get to the part I liked. The beginning was repetitive, almost boring once you realized the general plot and overly long before the hero and heroine got together. I wish the reason Grace was set on this adventure did not involve such a heartbreaking tragedy. It was difficult for me to get beyond that part of the story and to understand Grace's quick attraction to Niall. While I realized Niall's devotion to his cause, it was also difficult to understand why he left Grace without a backward glance. Despite all these objections, I loved the last part of the book and wish it had been longer and the beginning much shorter."
4,Time travel romance takes a new twist,"I don't normally like time travel romance, but this one changed my mind. ""Son of the Morning"" was the first Linda Howard book that I'd read. The story is great already, then comes the time travel portion! The method for time travel is almost believable. The characters are endearing. The research that went into writing this story makes it so rich and interesting. I loved reading this book. I was actually bummed out because I finished it. I know I like a book when I want it to continue after the last page is read."
3,Too long,"I liked this book because it had both romance, adventure, suspense... a kind of female Indiana Jones. The problem, in my humble opinion, resides in the fact the LH spent too long on the introduction and Graces' escape. Only about 1/4 of the book is dedicated to romance with Niall."
4,Great!,I loved this book. It made me laugh out loud on the subway!!! Great characters. The love scenes are incredible.
5,Wow - when do they come out with the movie!,I loved Diana Gabaldon and took a reference (from here) to try this. This was a GREAT book. Kinda a cross between the X-files and Indiana Jones. I have never read Linda Howard before this time and I have to say after reading this I have gone out to get more! The story was very catching which made me stay up late and get up early to finish it and boy was it sexy - gosh.... thinking about reading some of those scenes to DH as see what happens ;-)
5,Prepared to be captured!!,"Once again, Linda Howard has outdone herself. The build up in this story is so stimulating...you will not be able to put it down!! So, make sure you have a night to read it!! It was sexy, exciting, suspenseful, and romantic. The characters were so believable, and it was a time travel romance-so that says a lot about the book!! You must read this book!! DO NOT MISS IT! Thank you Linda Howard for a truly awesome story..."
3,Pretty good!,"This is my second Linda Howard novel, and it is surely better than my first, which was Now you see her.My only complaint was that it was not a pure romance. Though the book was well written and fast paced, and the historical aspect was quite intriguing,I felt that not enough time and effort was devoted to the interaction between the two primary characters.So there falling in love at the end seemed to be pretty implausible. I don't know why she wasted the first hundread pages of the book describing stuff that could easily have been brushed over.Also,the stuff about the secret treasure wasn't fully explained, and the last few pages left me somewhat confused.Other than these flaws, the book was a pretty interesting read."
5,One of my favorites,Unique story around a time travel romance. I have the book in hard copy and ordered it for my Kindle to re-read while traveling
4,Wow!,I loved this book. It was well written and the characters captured my imagination. The only reason it didn't get five stars was because LH tried to explain twentieth century reigion away with twelfth century logic. Other than the whole ridiculously written lines from Niall in the ending part I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
3,Works as Advertised,Used this to keep the oil warm in our standby generator during winter. The 25w gets warmer than you'd think and seems to work well.
1,25 watt kats,"I plugged it in and it did not work. I also bought a 50 watt Kat's and it worked fine. If you order one check it out before you go to the trouble of installing it as I did, just to have to uninstall."
5,Works Well,I used this to make a warming box. It works very well. I had to do some searching to find this. Nice simple product.
5,Different but I like him!,Have been a PW fan since the early '70's - can't say which album of his I like the best - but I saved the vinyl's and have the CD's now!!!
3,Cute but too synthetic,"My 4 year old takes this slumber bag to preschool for naptime. He loves Blue but, my only complaint is that is too harsh and synthetic. I expected something softer, more like a comforter (since it's an indoor slumber bag)Every time somebody touches it gets a load of static electricity. I picked my son up after naptime a few days ago and he gave a supercharged 'electric' kiss, lol. Other than that it's not so bad."
1,Wrong product,"Outer package indicated product ordered (CD-R Pro), however when opened one of the packages, they were ""Photo"" version instead of data discs that I had been using to record music from iTunes on computer. Contacted Maxell, and they informed me of labeling error and instructed me to return the blank discs to them. Unfortunately, it will be 4-6 weeks before replacements will be sent, and had to pay $12 shipping costs."
2,THE BEST CD-R YOU CAN GETUPDATE REVIEW,"these cds are made in japan.they are very high quality.very reliable.the disc do infact have a booklet where you can store important information if you creating a special project or more room to label the songs you record. the disc feel light and you can see thru them,but dont let that bother you because these cd-rs work very good.i am very pleased with these cd-rs and highly recommend them.HERES MY UPODATED REVIEW OF THESE CDS. THEY WORK FINE FOR A WHILE BUT NOW THEY HAVE STOPPED WORKING.I WOULD NOT BUY THESE DISCS. THE SAMSUNGS CD-RS ARE BETTER QUALITY."
4,TOMMY,"Tommy-The Concept Album. This is a good album, but it is ruined by silly filler (""Tommy Can You Hear Me"", ""There's A Doctor""), simply there to get the story across. I think that it would have been possible to make REAL songs to fill these ideas. However, there are enough fantastic songs on this record to make up for it. Many songs on this could have been singles easily enough, although most of them (""Pinball Wizard"", ""We're Not Gonna Take It"") make sense only in the context of the album. There are no actual songs on this album that are truly bad: if you don't like the melody, read the lyrics, and vise versa. I think that this album (for me at least) places the Who as the 2nd best artists of all time, and Pete Townsend the 2nd best songwriter."
2,"Music's great, controls suck.","For the music, its great. A new take on a classic. If I had one complaint, it would be that Roger comes out of the surrounds too often when I want him to be in front, but that's not a big deal.However, unless I am a clueless moron (possible), you can't pause or fast forward or rewind while listening. Somebody please correct me if there's a way to do it or its a problem with my remote or blu-ray player, but I could not pause, and I really wanted too.I dock three stars for taking away my control."
4,"A good album, but so much better live.","I think this is a very good album, but not as good as Who's Next, Quadrophenia, and the last few albums. The songs are great, there's good playing, but it has horrid production and it's sounds soft. Live, they were on a whole different level. I'd prefer Live At Leeds Deluxe Edition and Isle of Wight 1970 over this. But the original isn't completely bad. Acid Queen is my personal favorite, and there's Cousin Kevin, an underrated gem. Welcome, Sensation, and 1921 are amazing songs. However, there's some bad filler in here like There's a Doctor, Underture (a complete rehash of Sparks), and Miracle Cure. However, Sally Simpson has some great production and sounds like Who's Next. The Who has had better albums, though, but this is a step in the right direction."
5,Tommy in 5.1,"To hear Tommy in high definition surround sound is a religious experience. If you have a SACD player with a 5.1 setup, buy this immediately. Thank you Pete Townshend. How about the Who Sell Out and Live at Leeds (unedited and in the correct playing order)on SACD in surround next. Please!!!!!!!!!"
1,where's the whole album?,"5 stars for the album Tommy, the 1 star is for the download. I bought the mp3 download and I only received half the songs on both discs."
5,Forgot how good this is!,"I hadn't listened to Tommy for years. My loss as I forgot just how good this album is! Captain Walker, the Acid Queen, Uncle Ernie, Sally Simpson, they are all still here and greater than ever! As well as one of the greatest song segments of all time(listening to you, I get excitement at your feet, etc.). Do yourself a favor and re-experience Tommy, it is well worth it!"
5,Rock 'N' Roll at its Best!,"'Tommy' is definately one of the best albums I've ever heard. While its true that the story may not have made a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, its really about the music. And believe me the music is incredible. Pete Townshend truly has an ear for melody. If you like rock operas may I also recommend 'Arthur (Or The Decline And Fall Of The British Empire)' by The Kinks."
3,"Give me rock, not opera","I have never been much for the so-called ""rock opera,"" with its big production, overblown instrumentation and pretentious overtures and movements. The Who's Tommy is, I suppose, the best of this lot, but give me a snappy two- or three-minute single like ""Can't Explain"" or ""The Seeker,"" and I'll still pick it over this stuff any day. The Who was best as a singles band."
1,Didn't care for this.,"I could tolerate most WHo albums up until this one which is where the wheels started to come off. The riffs are not memorible, the songs sounds lost and the album is a whole was very forgettible for me."
2,$61.00 for a bargain bin item,"I am loathe to leave negative or neutral feedback. In these times, we all need all the help we can get.But I also need to be honest. And for $61.00 I just bought an album that was listed as Like New which is in mediorcre condition at best. Caveat emptor, my bad. But as anyone, I have come to trust the listings on Amazon as a true reflection of the items I purchase. And it largely has been. Not this time.A low or neutral rating is an indication to other shoppers that this seller either mislead me or doesn't know what they are doing. I am a collector of albums. I got a raw deal. This is my attempt at ensuring others don't as well.After I left a (generous) three star rating, this seller e-mailed me asking me to reconsider. No. From now on, rate your items correctly and honestly. Sixty bucks is a lot for a perfect copy of this record. It's a REAL lot for a banged up copy.Don't avoid this seller, but be sure to research.Thank you."
5,la mas perefecta opera rock,"The Who consiguen la perfeccion dramatica,musical y operistica con esta obra.Impresiona la fuerza interpretativa de Roger durante la fase ""autistica"".Supera con creces a Quadrophenia.Ademas es mas representativa ideologicamente."
1,listen carefully,"I know most of the other reviews say this is a great album . well it is , however during this sacd version there are many drop outs not found on the dvd audio version . you can really here it on John's voice during the acid queen. also the dvd audio lets you enjoy this masterpiece without changing discs . get the dvd audio version for the best reproduction of this classic."
4,pretty good,"This cd is worth the money you will spend on it. it has some of the greatest who songs and is at great value, many many songs for a cd. Nowadays you'll be lucky to find a cd with more than 15 songs in it. but i will recomend it and say, enjoy this ""rock Opera""."
4,Many good songs...,"...but only OK as an album.This one is interesting in that it ranks high in all other categories except listenability. I like many of the songs, but listening to them all straight through is exhausting. Most are very catchy and singable, which is both a blessing and a curse. After I heard them a few times, I got tired of them, yet they stayed in my head for weeks.If you're new to The Who, or to classic rock, it's required listening. It's a big part of history and the evolution of rock. It was ahead of its time, not just in terms of the music, but also the format and the subject matter. Townshend, at his peak, was one of the most creative songwriters and best rhythm guitarists. This album showcases his talents.Many of the songs have been played to death on the radio. But imagine hearing this album when it first came out in '69. It's important to keep this in mind when listening.Songwriting: 10/10Musicianship: 10/10Sound Quality: 10/10Originality: 10/10Listenability: 7/10"
1,The Who Tommy CD,I have received two albums; returned the first album because CD#2 would not be recognized by any of the four CD players I put it in. I am sending back #2 for the same problem. I would think others have had this issue and it is not corrected. I will send #2 back for a refund.
3,One of the most over-rated rock albums of all time,Pompous and overblown. It takes two albums to say what could have been said in one. Don't you have anything better to do than listen to this album from beginning to end?
1,Disappointing,"I was never a big Who fan and recently saw an old (late '60's?) Stones concert tape on which they performed, poorly by comparison. But I had fond memories of this album and was looking for hard-to-find surround sound dvd's to play in my car, which comes equipped with it. I've only played it once, and there's the possibility of incompatibility with my system, but it was a big disappointment - poor quality sound which may have taken the heart out of the ""opera"", which now seems extremely dated. One man's opinion: don't bother."
2,"Great Music, but a rock and roll crime.","Tommy is not the first rock opera, as it is widely acknowledged to be. The story of Tommy is not even the Who's. While the music of Tommy is great, and some of the Who's best, the album itself is a crime. The real first rock opera is S.F. Sorrow by the Pretty Things, a psychedelic band from San Franciso, released in 1968.The album is a rock opera and tells virtually the exact same story as Tommy, except the protaganist;s name is S.F. Sorrow, not Tommy. For some reason, The Who not only gets the credit for making the first rock opera, but also for a story they didn't even think of. I like the Who a lot, but this album is a complete slap in the face to The Pretty Things. Townsend even admitted that most of his influence for Tommy came from S.F. Sorrow, but forgot to say the reason was its the same story and concept of Tommy."
5,Never gets old,"I have had Tommy in my car for about a year now, and it never gets old. Each and every time I listen to it, I hear something new. Maybe there is an underture throughout the whole album, but it changes, and I love how it does. An original concept album, that is just beuitiful to hear, even in its saddest darkest parts. There is just something about it that never gets old."
5,Hurray! Tommy is back!,Tommy hasn't played much in the last few years but now they are reviving it at the Stratford Festival with the original director. So it is great to hear this music again.
2,I bought the original. Oops!,"Bought the original release of Tommy,, but it is not the one I remember. Apparently the second release was better orchestrated, which explains the higher cost. Live and learn."
4,A Great Record,"Ive only recently been reacquainted with this album.I owned it on vinyl but not on cd,so I havent played it in nearly 20 years!What was I waiting for? Honestly,""Tommy"" took a backseat to ""Whos Next"",""Live At Leeds"",""Quadraphenia"",and""By Numbers"".With the exception of the ""hits"" from ""Tommy"" this record just didnt resonate with me.That is until now(better late than never,huh?)If I were to put this in percentages,I'd say 75% to 80% of this record is A-plus material.The rest are mostly decent tracks with a couple of ""filler"" tunes that I could do without.Most notably ""Fiddle about"" and ""Tommys Holiday Camp"".All in all,a very worthwhile purchase!"
5,the who rocks!!!!,"this is unbelievable. for kids of all ages. this got me into the who, and is still my favorite album. great for listenning at all ocasions. small note: the first two times i listened i thought it was ok,,, not till the third time did i appreciate it, so be patient."
5,Tommy is a great album,"This wonderful tale of a young deaf, dumb, and blind kid's treck to be saved is a classic. Told through the sound of excellent rock music. This has stood the test of time and will always be one of the best albums ever made."
4,Certainly Groundbreaking,"This Rock Opera is just loaded with great songs. Townsend was sure at a creative high with this release. Acid Queen, We're Not Gonna Take It, Overture, Pinball Wizzard, and I'm Free are all classics but Christmas, Go To The Mirror, and You Didn't Hear It are overlooked gems. Underture is way overlong and some of the short snipets are a bit annoying. The Listening To You Theme is a little overdone. None the less to get so many quality songs on a double CD is rare. And the vocal arrangements are certainly top knotch. This Rock Opera led to some other highly celebrated works like Pink Floyd's The Wall and The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway by Genesis. A sure fire winner."
2,Where is Tommy?????????????,Ive always been a huge fan of Tom Jones but his album THe Who is exceptionally bad. Instad of crooning and singing the good songs he is shouting and coughing and also the accompy musicians make a lot of noise.This is not so good.try again next time for a good Tommy album.Dave
1,tommy hilfiger is on this album,you are such a dumb dumb....tommy hilfiger is on the 8 track version of tommy. if you really pay attention he fills the dead air between tracks with sounds of the sirens. its ok that you missed his contributions to some of rocks bands most heavily influenced by oasis and hanson.
5,Thumbs-up for the best WHO album,"With all respect to Quadrophenia (and to a lesser extent Who's next and Who by numbers), this is the ultimate Who album.A brilliant gamble to Pete Townsend, an epic thematic album with tenderness, cruelty, and inventiveness. Can you imagine anyone making an album like this now. This is when people could dream a dream. Thanks Pete!"
4,Best way to do a headstand!!,"I bought this so I could enjoy the feeling of doing a headstand. I've got a compressed disc in my neck so I can't put any pressure on my head and neck. When I'm up in a headstand, my neck has an opportunity to stretch away from my chest and shoulders. This is a feeling that's not possible with full inversion benches. I don't use the exercise bands, there are so many other devices that can be used to get a better workout. I would have given it 5 stars if the documentation came with instructions on how to do more yoga poses using the bench. It appears to be a one trick pony, lol. Of course, the one trick is totally awesome and well worth the investment. I invert twice a day for 2 minutes each and it gives me tons of energy."
5,Love my new prop for inversions!,"I received the product quickly and it was a snap to set up. Move two pins from the holes they were in, for the stand to be in a closed position, to new holes to hold it open as shown. It is sturdy and makes inversions super easy. This is a great way to learn to engage core muscles when lifting legs overhead. I can hold the inversion much longer than in head and hand stands. LOVE IT! Every time I lay eyes on it I put myself in an inversion and that clears my brain and makes me feel better."
3,opening rather wide for narrow shoulders,"I find traditional headstands to be pretty uncomfortable. Using this prop to do a headstand is less painful than a prop-free headstand, but the padding is quite firm and the U cut-out is designed for people with wider shoulders than mine, so it was not pain free by any means. Adding pillows helps a bit. If you have wider shoulders than I do, you may not find using this uncomfortable. I would give it five stars if more of my shoulder was actually bearing on the padding.This product is very easy to put together and to convert to its flat/portable state. It's a little on the heavy side if you're planning on carrying it very far. I have no comment on the detachable bands."
1,no screen protection,i was very disappointed to receive this skin and realize that it doesn't protect the screen at all.
5,"Great product, as described...","I didn't think I would need a skin, but after just a few days the back of my 8800 had 2 scratches. I decided to try a skin for the first time. The skin fits great and has 'Blackberry' etched in the back. I really love the almost silky feel of the rubber, it makes the skin feel like it costs more than $10 and looks better too.I agree with another reviewer; The fit is snug if you use the skin along with the original holster. It makes it a little tougher to slide in and out."
4,It Works,"Fits good, looks good. Don't mind keeping my 8820 in my pocket now without carrying another case. If there is a negative it's a little slick and ain't going to help much if you drop it."
4,"Great skin, but slips tends to slip off when in the pocket.","The skin fits great and does a great job protecting the Blackberry from scratches. My only complaint is that the skin stretches very easily and often pops off as take it in and out of my pocket. Other than that, it does it's job well."
4,Good Skin,"Nice skin. As mentioned by others, it is a little loose and tough to use with a holster, but it works well to protect the phone and does what it is intended to do. I like to use it in the car to prevent it from sliding around."
3,Picks up every piece of lint around!,"This skin is has good protection and gives you a good grip on the phone - much better than the slippery phone by itself. Overall, I enjoy it. But, the skin picks up every piece of lint and dust that comes near it, so I always find myself having to wipe off (with water) the gunk that gets on the back of the cover. I wonder if anyone else has this problem?I've washed the case a few times with soap and water, and it has stood up to that."
5,Blackberry Skin,"I wanted protection for my new Blackberry 9630. This black, thin, rubbery skin is perfect. It protects the phone from scratches, dings, and minor drops, and is also anti-skid if you want to put it on a slippery, moving surface such as your car's dashboard. It's perfect for me."
5,Blackberry Rubber Skin/Faceplate,"Totally worth it. It fits my Blackberry 8830 World Edition a little snug, just a like the new one did, and I love it. Delivery was prompt, and the rubber skin/faceplate was exactly like the one I purchased at a Verizon store a couple of years back for $20 bucks. This is a great buy. I'm very happy with it, and would recommend it to anybody."
5,this and many of her books are incredible!!!,"U have read many of Dolores's books,she has a very good insight on things. Her regression stories are fasanating.She is a one of a kind author. I wish many people to read her works. David Becnel"
1,Disapointed,Dolores showed her prejudices very early and wrote the text to support these biases.She should be ashamed to try and pass off the ramblings of her subject as truth. I would not recommend this bookFrank L
5,Jesus and the Essenes,"Another volume in Delores Cannon's excellent written books. This story discloses the important facts and details that have left people looking for answers for centuries. Christianity was created before Jesus and many of Christ's teachings came from more than the Jewish standard beliefs. Too bad Religious Scholars would not let the Dead Sea scrolls be openly disclosed and let people know the truth about what they are afraid to share.If the truth was to be revealed, it would shake the Religious Establishment to it's somewhat corrupt core."
4,"Entertaining, but by no means authoritative","As a person who believes uncovering past lives (and communicating with the individual found) is nothing more than communicating with evil spirits, my rating of four stars is awarded purely for the entertaining nature of the story told. Evil spirits cannot be trusted to tell the entire truth, therefore what the reader learns may be enlightening, but by no means authoritative."
5,Great Blanket,I received this item as a baby shower gift and fell in love with it! It's extremely soft. My teenage daughter even wants one for herself now!
1,"Poor Stitching, buyer beware","I registered for and recieved this blanket and loved the softness but after the very first wash the satin trim fell off and began to fall apart in numerous places due to poor stitching. I thought that it might be an isolated incident but was disappointed twice with the same problem. So, if you plan on buying one of these, I highly recommend that you carefully inspect the seam around the trim because ALL of them at the store would have posed the same problem. For twenty dollars, I shouldn't have to worry about sewing it myself. Poor quality, one star."
1,Is anyone have the same problem as mine? The hair of this blanket came off!!!,Just curious if anyone has the same problem as mine. The hair of this blanket just came off easily.
4,Long Overdue,"Cherry Pop did a tremendous job w/ the Teases & Dares reissue. This was always my favorite Kim Wilde CD. To have the sound all cleaned up and all the extra bonus tracks included make this a no-brainer. It may seem a little dated at times, but then again when you go back and listen a few times it brings back lots of memories from when the recording was new. A must have for any Kim Wilde fan, or anyone looking for some good music from the era. This CD does not all sound the same, it has a good variety, from dance to ballads and in between."
5,"Dark, Daring Psychological Suspense Novel","In ""Safe As Houses,"" Carol Anne Davis takes even more risks than she did in her previous novel, ""Shrouded."" Both are excellent, tension-filled novels that explore (sexual) violence on numerous levels.In ""Safe As Houses,"" we feel less like a reader and more like a voyeur. We know exactly WHO the villain is - and we know exactly WHAT he's doing to his victims. What we don't know is when (or if) he'll get caught. And this villain's relationship with his wife is almost as fascinating as he is.Another excellent effort from Carol Anne Davis - and very highly recommended for a fast, can't-put-down read."
4,"Buen disco, selección de canciones monótona","Había escuchado un par de canciones de Susie y me gustaba por el suave y arrullador tono de voz. En este disco, eso puede convertirse en un problema pues casi todas las canciones tienen parecido, no hay variaciones drásticas que suelen hacer los grupos de jazz que más me gustan, como E.S.T o Pat Metheny... Pero lo que salva y por lo que le doy 4 estrellas, son las interpretaciones de Jordan Officer, simplemente soberbias. Recomiendo más el DVD, pues además de contar con más canciones, se puede apreciar a mayor detalle dichas ejecuciones. Tambien es muy interesante su entrevista. En fin, muy buen disco, pero no es extraordinario."
1,Not recommended!!,The singer has the audacity of playing the snare drum and sing at the same time. She is just average at singing and does not know how to play the drum with brushes either. Reminded me of a folk band.The band drummer does not appear until about the 3rd song and she continues to play the snare drum and sing. Drummer is waisting his time being there. A cross between Django and trad jazz. I quickly played the first few seconds of each track and it was all the same. Average singing and very average at that!! And then just guitar solos. I threw the dvd and cd in the garbage 10 minutes after opening it. Unfortunately I could not find any reviews for this item before I purchased. This is not Jazz!!!!!!!
1,Amazingly disappointing,"I'm a big Cirque du Soleil fan and decided to buy everything available on DVD after watching the previous releases, Quidam and Drallion. This, along with a few others that have been recently released, turned out to be a big disappointment. I couldn't enjoy a single minute of this the extremely outdated and kitsch show. The music is terrible. Everything has a ridiculous 80s edge that completely kills any aesthetic qualities that I'd associated with CdS. Before I've seen this I had thought that all of their shows were timeless. Apparently, the earlier ones are not. I wouldn't even rate this favourably as an ordinary, low quality and low budget circus. Plus the DVD is very short and doesn't have any extras. Considering its claimed historical importance (?) perhaps it would be worth the price if it had been bundled with Baroque Odyssey."
4,Classic Cirque,"Direct contrast to the previous one- it's not a ""freak show"". Cirque had to start somewhere, and Cirque Reinvente is it. At the time, Cirque du Soleil was considered daring and avant-garde, even though Reinvente has fallen by the wayside of newer Cirques such as Dralion, Quidam, and O. The comedic acts are still there, and these are some of the funniest moments ever recorded. Have *you* ever tried to direct the 1812 Overture while your feet are strapped to a small trampoline?"
2,Cirque has come a long way,"Looking back at this DVD is proof that Cirque shows are now much much better and more entertaining. I found this DVD rather boring compared with the newer shows. It has fairly typical performances, but the clowns are good (especially the conductor). Only die-hard Cirque fans should purchase this disc to complete their collection. Other people who are new to Cirque may find this DVD boring and be turned off to other shows."
1,Don't buy this Cirque du (School)!,"I love Cirque du Soleil, but this is an amateur Cirque at best.I've travelled to LA (Saltimbanco) and LV ('O') to see them and have bought many of their shows on DVD, most of which I love. I watch them with my 3 year old daughter who adores them despite the fact that they don't have animals and despite the fact that the Cirque is predominantly for an adult audience. She nevertheless can tell me, by title which one she wants to watch and we agree that Saltimbanco, Allegria and Quidam are our favourites. So when I popped this one into the machine you can't imagine our disappointment. Pathetic and amateurish and a DVD which should never be seen by anyone, let alone sold to an audience. It seems like a few school kids playing Cirque in a cheap school hall environment, there is NONE of that Cirque magic. Don't waste (a lot of) money, rather buy one of the previously mentioned and you won't be disappointed."
4,cirque du soleil cirque reinvente,Hello thank you for your delivery of the product in fast time and in good shape it was a good dvd and a great collector addition thank you so much for the service. yours sincerely michael l
2,Uhm...,"...I actually saw a Canadian television version of this, but as far as I know, it had all the same stunts. It was just disappointing. The costumes, which I normally love to gape at, weren't as fantastic as I remember, and the clowns couldn't even be called funny. The dancer sort of MC of the performance was charismatic, but she didn't add much depth to anything. This is NOT worth the price. Rent it borrow it steal it, just don't pay this much for it."
3,PIECEMEAL IN NOT ALL,"I have read many of Keegan's books, and in this particularly it would seem that a piecemeal analysis of battles is not correct or enlightening, since you can't separate events which mostly take place all at the same time. It would be like analyzing one by one the taste of diverse components of a stew. It is all put together what counts. Besides, there are some foolish mistakes as the one of the Nautilus during Midway -which other reviewer described- that are truly demodé.The more you get away from WW2, the better Keegan looks, since for that war he is the quintessential ""politically correct establishment historian"". Regarding the war in the Pacific, maybe that doesn't show that much.The book is an engaging read."
3,Keep your feet dry,"Sir John enjoys a deserved reputation as one of the foremost military historians, but his strength is narrative, not analysis. Whatever possessed him to spoil The Face of Battle with his final paragraph? (""The suspicion grows that the face of battle will abolish itself."")Apart from the egregious factual errors in Price of Admiralty, Keegan offers very little evidence for his perplexing conclusion that the submarine has been the dominant naval weapon of the 20th century. Considering how very few submarines have ""shot for blood"" since 1945, and the fact that carrier aircraft dominated subs in the Atlantic and Pacific, Keegan's assertion is extremely difficult to support. If he was thinking of Cold War deterrent, he still missed the mark by a wide margin since subs were only 1/3 of the nuclear triad.Sir John does much better when he keeps his feet dry."
4,"Best author, one of his better works!",A must for anyone interested in the subject or in military history
1,What happens when a contracted manuscript is rejected?,"The author changes a few names and submits it somewhere else, even if it WAS originally written in another author's universe using that other author's outline... A quick search on Usenet will reveal that Charles Sasser was the original coauthor contracted to write ""The Hero"" with John Ringo, but the manuscript was deemed unrepairable by the publisher and so the contract passed to Mike. Leaving Charles Sasser with a manuscript and no contract for it. As can be seen from the description, little was changed from John Ringo's outline, and some of the alien race names are retained (although anyone calling the Indowy warlike obviously didn't read the other Aldenata books very closely)."
1,Dark Planet? Plot seems familiar!,"HMMM, If I were John Ringo or Mike Williamson I'd be insulted as this book is a blatant ripoff of ""Hero"""
1,None,"Did anyone notice that this ""book"" was publshed on April 1? April Fool's Day! Nuff said, You know What I Mean?"
1,"Biography, Hughie Call","I am very disappointed! I kept waiting for more information to arrive. Everything that was in my digital locker was available (at no cost) on many other sites--in book and author descriptions. Even though this biography was not very expensive,I feel this was a waste of my hard earned money."
5,Excellent book!,Kent Nerburn has written a gentle book of wisdom. Small Graces is a gift to be given to others. He is a very fine writer and brings a quiet understanding of the world to us.
4,Lovely,"Lovely, simple and inspires gratitude. It's very good for the heart and spirit. Occasionally sappy but that may just be my state of mind at the time."
3,Nice construction but shade of silver makes them look cheaper than pictures indicate,"They look like the picture for the most part, well constructed, but they are a real light silver which makes them look cheaper and doesnt really match my higher quality silver."
1,Very Poor Product and Software,"Over the period of a year...and after ""many hours"" on the phone with the ADS Tech support dept.I never could get the product to work as ADS Tech says it should. the software has a lot of patches.I even had a hard time getting the product replaced by the ADS Tech.""Don't Buy it"" is the only thing I can say!!"
2,Hardware has Problems!!,"Bottom-Line: Unless you have a TBC (time-base-corrector) to fix your nasty VCR video you plan on converting to a DVD, don't bother with this product! For making a DVD of a saved Tivo show or a live satellite feed or a live cable channel of your favorite show, this should work fine for you (use S-Video cables if possible). Don't expect it to work if you are converting video tapes (VHS, 8mm, etc.) to DVDs because of the devices hardware/software design limitations."
3,Good but Finicky Product with No Support,"When it works, it is very good; quality of video and sound captures is great. Unfortunately the problems are:1. Recognizing the hardware, repeated rebooting and power on and off to start it.2. Ulead Software, absolutely fantastic when it works, freezes for no reason.THE WORST FEATURE IS THE SUPPORT: NON EXISTENT. AFTER MORE THAN A WEEK'S WAITING AND SENDING TWO E-MAILS OF DISTRESS TO SUPPORT, THE REPLY WAS WHICH VERSION OF CAPWHIZ?COME ON, ASK THAT ON THE DROP DOWN MENU WHEN HELP IS SOUGHT WHEN OTHER RELEVANT QUESTIONS ARE ASKED.I am still in two minds about returning it, awaiting tech support reply after giving them information that it is CAPWHIZ 3.0Any help from other users?"
2,Stops capturing after 34 to 35 seconds,"I bought this DVD Express unit in December to capture from my analog camcorder, V8 tape. Working on WinXP Professional, 2.8GHz, Intel, 512Mb memory. The problem I have encountered is that it only captures about 34 to 35 seconds of footage before it stops converting and capturing. No warning to say that it has crashed out, not that it should crash out anyway. The red record button on the CapWiz stays activated and the recording timer stays counting. However the 34-35 seconds of footage is recorded on hard drive. To continue I have to rewind tape and re-start Capwiz. What a nuisance. With about 35 hrs of tapes to convert this is very annoying. The footage it does capture is excellent and I find Ulead Video Studio very good for editing. ( I have spent the time at desifering the mechanism of video studio, almost like putting a 1000 piece gigsaw together, but I've got there and I'm happy with video studio)Can anyone help with this crashing problem?"
3,fair over heats,keep it cool and the color seem to do better not bad product for money but ther is beter they should have made biger and put fan in it just put in cooler with ice works fine use 2 litter bottles
1,I Would Never Recommend this Product to Anyone,I've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row. I've spent hours with this product on several machines and I can now say the hardware sucks.
1,product is not good,i bougth this product tinking was good. but it was only head ache. i don't recomend this to any body is just a peace of junk .is not good at all
4,Good Product at a Good Price,I have used the DVD Express 2.0 for 2 weeks now and have been very pleased with the results. I have backed up approximatly 10 hours of home videos using both Capture Wizard and Video 7 SE and have not had any problems with lock ups of the software. I have the DVD Express plugged into a ADS Tech USB 2.0 card and have captured up to 2 1/2 hours worth of 720 by 480 mepeg 2 video at 9/mbs. The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is that the Video 7 SE software that is included is limited in its function. I would recommend this product to anyone for analog capture.
3,A buggy product that works,"After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try, in the hope that I wouldn't see many problems others reported. I ran it to capture a couple hours of video (VCD quality) and found similar problems.1. CapWiz crashes once. It's definitely a bug in the software.2. When the scenes change and there's empty signal in between, the capwiz will freeze. I have to resume recording manually.3. Sometimes it will capture nothing (black) while the video is running. Need to restart several times to make it work.Finanlly I managed to overcome all the unpleasure problems and got the job done. The longest footage I captured is about 50 mins and I don't see audio out of sync as other reviewers said. I have Athlon 1.2G, 256M ram and geforce ti 4200."
4,"Overall, it's good","I just bought this piece of equipment and I'd have to say I'm pretty satisfied with it. I am using it on a P4 3Ghz computer with 1Gig of Ram and an Radeon (sp?) 256 graphics card and haven't had any problems. Installation was quick and easy, assuming you READ the instructions and follow them.Capturing the video was easy. I wouldn't recommend using the Ulead software that came with this product for video editing. It's cumbersome...there's better software out there. The other features of the software is fine for basic dvd authoring. Buring the finished video to a dvd disc is easy and I had no problems.Summary: I'd recommend this product, but use different dvd software to edit your movies."
1,Wow,I do not know how it works because it came with one the disks broken. Don't know what to do now.
1,Poor product,I bought this ADS DVD converter to try to convert my VHS to DVD.Never able to get it to work.Poor Tech support.Finally I had it working but it stops working again next day.You can find something better. Do not waste your time and money on this thing
1,worse than godzilla,the audio is out of sync with the video. It captures sort of like watching an old godzilla movie. Hated it.
5,Ludwig's book still the best of Parrish in print.,"Mr. Ludwig's book was the first tome on Parrish I ever had in my hands. That was in 1973, and I still consider it the most comprehensive book on the man and his art available. While there are many more Parrish publications on the shelves today than 25 years ago (several with more and better reproductions), none has the interesting mix of biography, reproductions, catalog and technical information on Parrish and his work that Mr. Ludwig included in this book (the bibliography sent me in search of as many of the original magazine articles as I could find,... well worth the hunt). This is one Parrish book that feels as if it were done for love of the artist and not for love of money."
4,Savage Caves,"The Savage Caves is a great book for people who like fantasy. I liked this book because it hooked me into it to keep reading. It was also great because it had mysterious schemes behind the plot that makes you keep reading. The down side to the book is that it can be confusing and a tiny bit boring at times. But other than that it is a great book, you should purchase this book, and trust me it is worth your money."
4,Great saying,"Got this for my flower bed even though it has holes in back to hang it. I just love what it says, and it makes me smile everytime I read it. It is great as a gift or for yourself!"
5,Never gets old !,"My kid (one of Hobbs' many students) and I really enjoy this album; it is a favorite in our extensive collection. Steve Hobbs is truly underrated in his career as a music instructor and professional performer. Keep up the great work, Hobbs!"
3,A Little Frustrating,"This toy looks really cool, but it falls down quite often, and the pieces fall off too. My kids still like it, but it can be frustrating at times. I think that it would have been better to make the pieces stay attached better, allowing more time playing rather than fixing."
1,DON'T waste your money!!,"This toy is a piece of junk. Every five seconds something is breaking, and once you get it open it's nearly impossible to get it back together. Purely junk."
1,This toy will make your child smarter.,"Do what we did: buy this toy, watch as you and your child try to play with it (key word and first tip being ""try"") and only then visit Amazon and read the reviews.Next time out, both you and your child will be smarter about taking the time to read the reviews FIRST.Don't buy this."
1,Waste of Money and Waste of Time,"I wished I had read the comments about this toy before buying it last night. The instructions were terrible, the toy is flimsy, it's definitely NOT worth the money!!! This toy does not deserve a star rating! My four year old, even asked me to take it back!... Took it back and received a refund this afternoon. Again...Don't bother buying this toy!"
1,A complete piece of junk - not worth the box it is packaged in,"This is horribly frustrating for both adults and kids. They expect it to be fun, but it is miserable. Hard to assemble, the features in the toy don't work the way the should which leads to disappointment and frustration.Miserable!! Don't buy this one"
1,Two words... bat droppings,"I have two words for you... bat droppings. This is definitely the worst $50 I ever spent. It's flimsy, it doesn't go back together, and getting it together took an engineering degree. I wish I had read up on it before buying it."
1,Horrible!!!!,Do not bother to buy this toy..you will return it..It is impossible to assemble..constantly falls down and the parts impossible to fit together...never seen anything this bad before with the price so high...The directions are even worse..what a disapointment for my sons on their birthday..
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I got this toy for my one of my triplet sons for his 5th birthday, and I am appalled that I paid $50 for such a poorly made product. They say it ""transforms"" into the batmobile - that is a joke! You have to take most of it apart to get it to fold back up, so why bother with that ""feature"" in the first place? The whole thing is made terribly. It barely stands upright, and the little plastic chains that suspend the one set of platforms keep coming off the little plastic hooks. None of my boys play with it, and now I am stuck with it because I don't have the box anymore to return it. Bottom line: this was a complete waste of money."
1,Keep your sanity!,If you want to keep your sanity you will not buy this toy! I read the reviews before I bought this for my son and should have taken them to heart! He wanted it so badly. I could have used the $ for this on other things!This is so hard to but back together once you get it open. It's so frustrating. I didn't realize that it had so many little parts to put together and keep track of once opened. It is very loud and not sure what the sound is supposed to be. I think a subway train. It doesn't come with a batman so all the 6 batman that we have do not fit..My 51/2 year old was very disapointed and he gets so frustrated when playing with this!
2,not worth the money,"The produce is sandy, grainy, not what i expected. It is sweet but hey the cost is ridiculous. I wanted to try it and now I have but never again. Your money can be spent much more wisely. If you haven't used Muscavado brown sugar give that a try, it's relatively expensive but definitely worth the money."
3,"Short book, crammed with too much filler.","I must say that I was disappointed with this book. It has some great advice in it, but you have to shift through too many ""testimonials"" talking about what a great technique this is by people who've used it. Plus you get to read about what a fantastic lover Tom is. Everything after page 75 is worthless, and the story of how he discovered this technique is a pointless digression. If you know how to give a good massage and know how to find the G-Spot, you can pass on this book. However, if you don't, then by all means pick it up. It's a quick read, and a pleasant way to kill a few hours."
1,"No, no, no!","Oh dear. This is an interesting attempt, but the English chamber choir approach does NOT work with Slavic church music. The basses are too polite, the baritones too clear, the tenors too swan-like, the altos too modest, the sopranos too bright. The different sections have varying success with the Church Slavonic/Russian ""oo"" vowel -- none of them produces it far back in the mouth enough to be convincing. After ten seconds of listening to this, and finding it intriguing to hear the different parts of the pieces articulated more specifically than a real Russian or Slavic choir would do, I lost interest and just found it sad and thin. Like hearing the Mormon Tabernacle Choir do Negro spirituals. If you want to hear more precision in this kind of music -- if real Russian choirs are too ""heavy"" for you -- try the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir. At least they get the spirit and pronunciation right."
5,Psychicatric Madness,"Elliot Valenstein's book is at the same time informative, provocative and disturbing. He has analyzed a dense literature and distilled from it key ideas that run counter to the current dogma of psychiatry and other ""helping professions,"" the currently fashionable view that so-called mental illnesses of many types are brain disorders. Valenstein prepares the reader with a well-crafted history of biological psychiatry, followed by a knoweldgable and intelligent critical analysis of the literature. This is a book that deserves a wide readership but, alas, will probably not receive it. The juggernaut of the brain psychiatrists and their sympathizers is just too overwhelming to give Valenstein's book the careful reading it deserves. I look forward to his next work, which I hope would examine the related claims for a biological basis of ADHD, homosexuality, alcoholism, and the like."
1,Typical Belkin Junk,"I wasted a couple hours of life on this JUNK.Decides for itself when you want to change inputs.If you push the button, 50% of time it fails to correctly hold new signal after user button press, swapping you back to other machine. The other half of the time it never finds the new signal and swaps you back to the first machine."
1,Horrible product,"Bought this hoping to replace my aged PS/2 KVM so I can use my USB keyboard and mouse, no go. Mouse worked fine, monitor (17"" widescreen sony) worked fine, but my keyboard was a no go. It would work, for about 30 seconds, then I'd get that ""you just disconnected a USB device"" beep in windows and it would take about 4 seconds for the keyboard to start responding again. Kind of annoying when you're driving at high speeds through the streets of San Andreas and all of a sudden your car careens off the side of the road and stops for 5 seconds.My keyboard is a Viewsonic Slim Keyboard KU201."
1,The 2 guys who got it to work right must have defective KVMs,Buying this KVM was probably one step short of someone knocking me down in the store and taking the 50 bucks out of my wallet.I'm a IT Engineer and still couldn't get it to work right. The gentleman who said it keeps autoswitching and losing the keyboard and mouse intermittently. Then disconnect it to get it working for 5 sec. is right on the money. If you want to see how far you can throw a KVM switch you should buy this one. I'll almost guarantee you'll get at least 10 yards out of it.
2,Classic Telephone,"This classic telephone looks great in the hallway of my old farmhouse. Unfortunately, the push button dial tones have never worked properly. Since I bought it mostly for looks and it does receive calls, I haven't tried to return it."
3,Looks great..... but...,"I purchased this phone for the reception area at my office. We wanted something fun and stylish and durable for our clients when they arrived. The description of this phone had me sold. Then it arrived.... The handle felt cheap and is all plastic. The button labels are slightly sloppy. And then the cord; it's advertised as fabric, but it isn't. It's just cheap rubber. I feel let down but don't feel like returning the phone. I figured I'll write a review to let everyone else know."
1,Lousy sound,The sound quality of this phone is terrible. I love the look and it seems to be very sturdy of construction. I am going to return it.
4,Don't buy a Coil Phone Cord !!!!!,"Hi,I just got the phone and then read the reviews, so if your like me this may not help. But don't order a different(longer)coil receiver cord. The phone can't use it. The cord is permanently attached at the mouth end of the hand receiver. Like they used to be... I guess. I ordered a 12 ft cord since the site said other people had. Sounded like a good idea, but it's not. I am still weighing the pros&cons; of returning the $2.99 item. When I receive this email,'Amazon.com recommends ""GE TL26139 25' Coil Phone Cord (Black)"" and more'. Don't listen to them, it's useless with this phone. The phone itself is nice and has worked well for the 2 days I have had it. So take my rating with a grain of salt.jaJ"
4,Crosley Kettle Classic Desk Phone,"I've only had the phone about 3 weeks but it's all good so far. I admit I bought it mainly for its charming shape. I like the way it looks sitting on my desk. The curves and mass of it are nice counterbalance to all the flat rectangular electronics which are necessary in a modern office. I had another Crosley phone back in 2004--the old style upright phone where the earpiece hangs up on a stick. It worked fine, too. I'd probably still have it if I hadn't misplaced it when I moved."
5,Great product,"It is a very great phone with great quality sound. You can also see the quality on the outside, the phone looks just like the old ones but with the features and quality of today. Nothing else to say but two big thumps up!!!"
2,Mine broke too!,"I bought the wall version of this phone, though NOT over Amazon. The pushbuttons didn't work when I got it. I returned it, and bought the same phone online (NOT thru Amazon, but from Crossley direct). The second phone worked fine for about six months. Now most of the pushbuttons don't work at all and three of them just stay stuck.It's great-looking, but don't buy it if you need a phone that works!"
2,"pretty, and that's it","I received this the beginning of May. I love the look of these phones, but it ends there. Two months after I received it, callers would here static and crackling when speaking with me. The handset is awkward to use (this is not my first time having a phone like this). Four months after receiving this, the phone died altogether. After reading other reviews, I gave up and cut my losses. I replaced it with an ugly phone from Rite-Aid for ten bucks and have had no problems. Too bad, it was pretty though."
2,"Looks nice but IMHO, Poor Quality","I was disappointed with this phone when I received it. Yes, it is vintage looking but that is about it. If you get within 5 feet of it you can tell this is no vintage phone. Cheap plastic, weighs practically nothing. The hand receiver has no meat to it. Not worth the 50 bucks, sending it back."
4,"Solid, good looking phone.","I bought this phone for my 1923 California bungalow, to put in the phone nook in the hall. Fits the bill perfectly. The dimensions are good (another reproduction was too deep) and it even sounds like a period phone. My only minor complaint is that the item photo shows an old fashioned straight cord from the receiver to the base, and mine came with the more modern curly cord."
2,purchased @ target,"Worked great, then the base fell off. It still worked untill my husband killed it trying to pick up in the middle of the night."
5,Love love love,I am in LOVE with my new phone!!! it is heavy duty and not cheap looking @ all. I like to collect vintage things but I wanted something I can use with a modern touch. I am very happy with this product. You do not have to plug into an electric outlet like cordless phones. WE use this phone but we have cordless phones in the house too. Again! I love love love this phone!
3,classic phone,I have been very disappointed in this phone. I seem to have lost calls. I have been having difficulty with getting dial tones and having conversations suddenly stopped by phone cutting out. The phone looks good but it doesn't operate well and for the price you pay the phone should be good. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Feel like I just wasted away my money.
2,Low Quality,This phone is low quality. First the cord can not be removed from the handset. Second it is made of a light plastic. Third the handset is not balanced so it sits on the cradle crooked. The sound quality is average. The ringer is soft as is the handset volume.
1,lost of money,"the phone did not even last a month, and I cannot make a call anymore. I can only receive the call. None of the bottom is working."
1,Does not work,"I am very disappointed that the phone does not work. I am satisfied with the appearance, and the curly cord is fine. But within 5 minutes of plugging in the phone the headset no longer transmitted the voice of the caller. The caller can hear me, but I cannot hear the caller, nor the dial tone -- nothing. It seems as if I can return it free of charge, which is great."
3,Not quiet what I expected,"I had previously ordered the Crosley wall phone in red. The quality was nice, it was shiny and felt solid. I purchased the black Crosley desk phone and found it to lack the same quality in material. Works fine, looks very cool. One bit of info that would have been helpful when buying this and seeing that others were buying the extra long cord to go with the phone is that you cannot attach the extended cord to the handset. I had to purchase a phone line coupler to extend my cord. That would have been handy info prior to purchase."
4,Nice retro looking phone,The phone is nice looking. Has a nice ring to it. Easy to use.I don't have anything to compare it to so gave it 4 stars. Got it in brushed chrome which was a good choice for me. It is a little awkward though if you try to prop it between shoulder and ear so as to write something down. Works easily as to the push buttons.
1,item not as pictured,"I specifically ordered the phone that I did because it mentioned/showed a cloth covered cord...when the item arrived, it was the right body, but the curly plastic cord...if I had wanted that, there was the option to order it that way. I would like the cloth covered cord I was promised when purchasing."
4,Not the best poster but good enough.,"This poster has the parts labeled in three languages, and has a decent layout of the muscles, but can be a little confusing. It's nice and big - I use it for reviewing the muscles before I go to sleep."
1,Not worth it,"I ordered this product for everyday wear. The Bizet setting holding the stones overwhelmed the stones, they were dark, covered in metal, had no shine thru and no light could get to them to sparkle or show facets or colors; it could have been dirty glass. The chain was too thin, ready to snap at the first hair snag. I returned it and found a CZ for less that looked much better."
5,Fantastic early reader,"We checked this book out at the library, and within 2 days, I'd read it enough times that my two year old had memorized it, and was ""reading"" it to me. We had to buy a copy, it has become one of his favorite books. He loves when I tweak his nose, and tickle his toes, and when he's feeling sick, I ask him if he wants lizard juice on ice and he laughs and laughs. Oatmeal raisin cookies have been renamed as cookies with bugs, trips to the pool are now adventures in the swamp, and rainy days have become ""hot dog"" days.This is a charmingly written, beautifully illustrated book that I highly recommend for every little monster."
5,great book,"I bought this because my son has been waking up scared of ""things"" in his room at night. He has been waking up a lot less lately, since we started reading this and another book. I really think this among other things has helped. It insinuates that monsters are scared of little boys and girls which is just what he needed to hear!! It is also very cute and makes monsters seem just like people!"
3,Just one thing.....,"I have a kohler niedecken tub faucet that was leaking for the longest time. This kit provided gasket replacements for all the worn or missing gaskets in my faucet. The kit worked great-for the most part. Now I don't have any more water dripping issues and the valve closes properly. One issue that the kit has introduced is that the ""column"" packing seal, which is the thick o-ring that fits on the knob itself, is incredibly tight. SO tight that herculean effort is involved to turn the knob at all now. Did the o-ring have to be greased before installation? It would have been nice to know in the instructions beforehand! So my recommendation, use all the o-rings in the kit except for the thick one ""column"" packing seal. The 50 year old one in my faucet wasn't leaking and I should have left well enough alone."
5,Inspirational,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It spoke to the fact that if you have a passion, you can use it to build a satisfying and rewarding way of life."
4,The American adventure is alive and well.,This is truly an inspirational book for everyone to enjoy. It is heartening to find a story like this to remind us all that the American adventure and dream is alive.
3,Simplistic and Sincere,I enjoyed reading the book and felt the author was very sincere and honest. It elicits a very positive feeling and conveys a good message...It wasn't taxing on my thinking.
2,The Mafia,"Mrs Thorsen's has just discovered that somebody is blackmailing her daughter and Mrs Thorsen is insisting on putting a final stop to the continuous blackmail at all cost. However, she approaches the Acme Detective Agency and hired the assistant of Dirk Wallace. But Wallace was soon understand that he is in for another round of the famous ""Royal Rumble"", infact he is way out of his depth and must go it all alone if he has any chance to succeed - after all, he is taking on the Mafiaso, a more deadly crew than the Wu Tang clan."
3,Summary and Prayer,"Basically a brief summary of Lobsang's autobiography along with help and advice on prayer. It's all covered extensively in his books, so I personally would only recommend this CD if you're interested really just to hear Lobsang's voice as I was. Being of interest to me in itself, I gave it three stars for this respect alone because it was not something I would play again and again and as far as the music afterwards, I'm sure the recording has seen much better days. The quality was so poor it made me chuckle a little as I thought it not particularly conducive to meditation."
1,Read before buying,"Upon arrival of this CD I was extremely disappointed as contained nothing regarding meditation and the condition of the CD was just a very bad copy, alike a pirated CD one may obtain from a market stall. Three tracks are of Dr Rampa and the rest is what someone calls music, also a bad copy. Apart from hearing Dr Rampa's voice the whole thing is a complete waste of money, don't bother buying it"
2,T.lobsang Rampa Story and Meditation,For me is is very hard to understand what he is saying. Thereis to much static noise to hear well.
3,I was disppointed overall,"I looked forward to reading this book. When I read it, frankly I was disappointed. The book rambled too much for my taste. I thought the book spent too much time talking about I've Got a Secret instead of What's My Line. I can understand why Gil mentioned I've Got a Secret, but I think he spent too much time discussing it. I also think he spent way too much time discussing the syndicated version of What's My Line. Once again I can understand why Gil mentioned the syndicated version, but I was expecting more discussion on the classic CBS version. Like I said, I was disappointed."
3,"It works, but...","Perhaps I'm just being fussy, but it would have received 5 stars from me if it had been a less toxic smell and sense about it. More ""green"", plus not in an aerosol can which really disperses the odor in a closed space. But it does work, and the price was okay, for cheap toxic chemicals."
5,"Legendary DJ, Legendary Mixes","Philadelphia's Josh Wink was the god of the mid-90's ecstacy underground rave circuit (not to be confused with today's mainstream scene). Higher State of Consciousness was the song that DJs used to peak their crowd, driving them into a frenzy of energy . It's rhythms are the learner mix for any DJ studying House. On this CD, each mix builds on the last, until it pinnacles it a state of blinding adrenaline.If you are looking for Trance, this is not it. First there was Disco, then House, now Trance. Higher State is the primer for House music from which Trance evolved. It's multiplying layers of beat and rhytm are the standard. For a complete collection, this is a staple.m (Also check out Warehouse Grooves, Vol. 3.)"
5,Correction on detail - Had to do josh the justice,"FYI-techfuzz from Atlanta, GA, USA who did a review of this excellent disc... Josh is from Philly not Detroit, just because detroit is a major player in acid house doesn't mean ALL acid house is from there. Anyways, the cd is incredible & I seriously suggest it for anybody who likes good acid tunes - this is the definitive track. Not only does it come with the tweaked original, it is excellently complemented with house mixes like Dex & jonesys & mr maggots, both standout tracks. Really all I can say is, get the disc."
1,It's a classic,"I am hard pressed to give an example of a sentence from this book that is not so laden with irrelevance that a moment's thought will not entirely dissolve its meaning. I give you the first, as a warning: ""We had been here, the ribbon of reminiscences reminded me, many times before."" And sentence after sentence, the author just doesn't quit, writing that is. And if you are like me, you will wish he had. Unless, of course, you hate baseball and everything to do with it, or you are a collector of the worst samples of writing in the english language. It's like when you were a kid with a nickel and you wanted to buy some candy, but every time you reached out to take a jaw breaker the guy behind the counter whacked you with a yard stick."
5,A Great Evangelical Gift Idea,"Chonda Pierce is fantastic -- you can't beat actually seeing her live, however, her humor and the pure enjoyment of listening to her is clearly trasmitted on her CD. This is a great gift idea to give to Christians and non-Christians. Once they get hooked listening to her comedy routine they'll keep listening to her Christian Testimony; it's a great way to get your skeptical friends and acquaintances to listen!"
2,Chonda Price,It ended up being a audio and I thought I was purchasing a video....my mistake I guess. Next time I will be more alert to this.
5,Faris Raza writes.......,The Yu-Gi-Oh! Buster Blader toy has finally arrived! You control Buster Blader as he Destroys Monsters! This Mighty monster can Slash through building walls!!! And you have the power to contol this almighty monster as he swings his sword and bashes through objects that you think he can't break! Everyone should get THIS!!!
3,Interesting,"As with many books I read, I discovered this book and author by accident. If I recall some arthor I read, mentioned her. I believe it was Rudolph Fisher the author of the Conjer Man Dies.I asssigned three stars to the first two books and 4 for the last, Of One Blood.My issues with the the general tone of the books are as follows:1) In the first book the story line just did not flow well. I had a difficult time keeping up with the characters.2) I found the language to be very pretentious and ornamental.3) All the whites and near whites are wonderful, beautiful, and the Blacks just blah.4) I believe these books were written to appeal to white readers.5) The tragic mullato them became tiresome.I only really enjoyed reading Of One Blood. However, I feel this book is still worth reading. You have a voice of a Black woman over 100 years ago. To me this makes it worthwhile."
2,wrong pic,this picture shows a 14 tooth sprocket and the discription says it is a 13 tooth front sprocket i ordered it hoping its a 13 tooth attention return department
4,Excellent Music!,"Heard this misic today and was blown away. The whole double CD is on the money, but the first album ""There's the rub"" is fantastic. A reviewer of this double CD said that the CD had skips and was returned twice. Mine is in excellent shape with no prblems whatsoever. Grab this, you will not be sorry that you did. At least, if your leary, get ""There's the rub"" by itself, which costs alot more than this CD. Take my word, though, this double CD is worth the money and more."
3,I give this a 5 star for band effort and performance....0 stars for quality of CD,I have purchased 2 separate CD's of this from 2 different sellers ...both advertised as new...and both copies were very defective.....and you cant tell by looking at the surface with your naked eye or with a magnifying glass....numerous skips....throughout....I have since ordered the individual CD's of these selections....In this scenario....2 strikes and YOU'RE out....DONT BUY THIS VERSION.....
5,There's The Rub,There's The Rub was their shining hour. What a great CD. I own it on vinyl and CD both. And for an analog recording what dynamics it has. You don't have to crank this one up to get the people in the next county to hear it. IT IS THERE. But I am glad I didn't pay the price they are asking here. Argus is another one of the better cd's. But I lean towards There's The Rub the most. Not a dull song on it. My fav track is Silver Shoes. Buy this you won't be disappointed.
3,"4.5 stars for The Rub, 2.5 stars for Locked In","The 2 on 1 CD is an excellent deal, as There's the Rub goes for around $30 by itself. However, there are no lyrics and really no liner notes to speak of. There is also no artwork included other than the generic artwork that you see on the listing. Most folks know of these albums, they are not too heavy, and not really WA's best. The reason for this review is that the CD doesn't skip! I was skeptical reading another chap's review, but I took the risk and purchased this CD and haven't had any problems."
3,Not Complete,"I love The Pretenders, especially Chrissie Hynde. But the jerk who put this album together should be run over by a girl with a mullet in a Ford Pinto.James is right, where's 'I'm Not In Love'? Great cover, hard to find. And 'The Homecoming' from the movie G.I. Jane? It rocks! The song 'Human' is wonderful, but what is this 'Rin Tin Tin' remix as ""the standard"" crud?! Put the original on. And no songs from Loose Screw? A bonafide WTF is in order... hey, why not put in 'Complex Person' or my other favorite 'I Should Of'; other notables are 'Kinda Nice, I Like It', 'Clean Up Woman' and 'Walk Like A Panther'.And to the joker that said Chrissie isn't special, choke on a cucumber. Who do you know that still rocks at this stage of their career? Who else seems to get better or keep up standards this late in a music career? And who gives a damn about politics, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MUSIC!-The Ayatollah of Cool has spoken. (LONG ROCK CHRISSIE!!!)"
4,"Love the music, but the sound...","Love the music, but the CD sounds better in in the car than at home, where it seems compressed (upper midrange emphasis, few quieter parts). Both of my vinyl Pretenders albums, Get Close and Learning to Crawl, sound better. For a sampler, this is a good selection. But if you already know you like Chrissie and her band, their other albums are far from ""a couple of hits plus filler"" - you'll like the in-between songs as much or more than the hits."
3,Human is a Gem!,"Human is the standout here - a personal Favourite. Popstar isanother great (recent) Recording. Kid is a good oldie &Message of Love / Hymn to Her, Bring back fond memories ofthat Era. Talk of the Town is my 2nd Fave - Timeless.Adequate album - But I was always a ""Admire-From-A-Distance""kind of Fan."
2,disappointing...,Bought it because I liked the song Human. The majority of the other songs are either labored or over-played on the radio.
2,Company Man,"I really like Joseph Finder, but this book just seemed to take forever to get into. I finally had to put it aside. I will probably pick it up later, but right now, I am eager to start Power Play."
3,Not Finder's best,"I read Paranoia & Killer Instinct & loved them....very fast paced & great fun reads. Perhaps the main character is not as sympathic a personality in this story, because two thirds of the way through this I am not glued to the page. Adored his late wife who seemed spoiled & materialistic.....immediately falls for a woman totally opposite. Is CEO of an immense corporation but is naively trusting & ineffectual at command of the ""ship"" & as advisor to his kids. Simply not as believeable a story as the others. However, I won't give up on Joseph Finder..........I'm sure he has a lot more to give us !"
3,"A promising start, a weak ending","IMO, it starts with witty remarks, a good description of the main characters. Then I felt that Nick would have benefited from showing a little more back bone. He seems not to know much about 'his' Company. I was not interested in what these people had for breakfast and for lunch, neither if they were 6 ft 2 tall or only 5 ft 3, but I have to admit this a very personal point of view. Two-thirds down the book, the main characters started sounding more like caricatures. That would have passed if there would not have been a heavy give-away. Towards the end, I got the feeling I was reading the script of a mediocre Hollywood movie."
2,Every character is cardboard but the brainless protag,"This novel would have better served its audience as a made-for-TV movie that haunted the nether regions of the dial and clock. As compelling as the plot aims to be, the idea that a CFO and a board member could successfully conspire to sell a giant global corporation out from under the CEO suggests the protagonist is too brainless for readers to care about and certainly incapable of pulling off the Disneyishly convenient resolution to all his business and criminal problems. I'll try another novel by Finder to see where all his positive reviews come from, but this one is filled with trite dialogue emerging from non-credible situations encountered by a protag who stumbles through far too many crises with the assistance of a sexy child prodigy rather than his own brain and spine."
1,"Predictable, ridiculous and a waste of time","I predicted the outcome in the first 1/6 of the book. It was silly and so exaggerated that any reader of mysteries would easily predict the outcome. The use of ""business jargon"" is especially silly - business buzz words just tossed in here and there as if the author had a list of them he just had to use before he ended the book. Silly, and unimaginative - I am so sorry I spent the money and actually read the book - I hardly ever stop reading a book once I have started since I always expect to get something out of any book - this book - no - nothing. Don't waste your money or time. This author is not for me."
5,What a thriller!!!! LOOOOOVE Joseph Finder!,"Another masterpiece by Mr. Finder - I am not shy to admit I am definitely a Finder Fan - He is able to thoroughly consume me - I read this book in less than a week, with a bulk of it the last 4 days. Fabulous story, lots of twists and turns, extremely well-established plot. The protagonist Nick Conover dealing with 2 serious issues, not to mention his petty ones, a murder on one hand, and back-stabbing bastards in his executive team and the board on the other - I simply loved it. I highly recommend it."
3,"Started strong, but lost reality","This is my first Joseph Finder book. I picked it up off a shelf in an airport. Earlier in the book, I would have given it four stars as I really liked the characters and the predicament that Nick, the strong CEO found himself. But then it lost points for some turns that just didn't make sense to me. Besides the main character, I also enjoyed the character of Audrey. She helped keep the book interesting to me by being a faith based person."
3,quick fun read,"This is a quick fun read....airplane or travel reading...a couple of surprise twists and enough action to pull you to the end. Not memorable, but better than TV serials"
4,A good book,"I know that a few of my friends read this book and they didn't like it. But I actually thought it was a pretty good book. Have I read better books, yeah, but this book is definitely worth the money."
5,Another good book by Mr. Finder,"I have been trying to pick this book up since it came out in hardback last year...I never did and then bought the paperback copy so I could fit in my pocketbook when I needed too....This was a great book, fast read because I could not put it down...I knew things were not what they seemed, but I just could not quite figure out how it was going to end. I could not put my finger on why I had suspicions and just why I knew that something was up...anyway....this is a fun book, and I look forward to Mr. Finder's next one. I have just purchased it in hardcover, and I think this time I won't wait, I'll go ahead and read it now!"
4,"4 1/2 Stars- Company Man ,Another Hit From The Thriller Man!","While not quite as good as Paranoia, Finder's latest is another of his thrillers that you'll find hard to put down. Without going into a lot of detail, Company Man is about Nick Conover, CEO of a leading office furniture manufacturer, who is facing major problems at work and even bigger threats to his personal life. In typical Finder fashion, he weaves a plot of non-stop suspense and develops characters that are credible and interesting, but not without flaws. The only reason I haven't given Company Man a five star rating is that I felt the ending was somewhat predictable. Nonetheless, Finder's latest thriller is well worth the investment, both in time and money. Enjoy!"
1,Are we talking about the same book here ???,"I my opinion Paranoia was a winner and the reason I gave Company Man a shot without thinking twice about it. In hindsight that might have been a bit naive but I never figured anyone who could put together a well written and entertaining thriller as that could put out a piece of junk as Company Man. The main character is one of the whimpiest ""heroes"" I have ever had the misfortune to come across. I mean, the guy has no spine at all and all he ever do is irritate the reader with his stupid, irrational decisions and cowardly actions. The plot is just plain stupid and only reason to finish the book is trying to postpone the realisation that you have been screwed. I can't believe all the positive reviews. This is pure garbage and there only right place for that is in the bin."
2,Going through the motions,"I'm a big Joseph Finder fan and I have to say that I was very disappointed in his latest novel. I took this book with me on vacation and I have to say it was a chore to get though. The story could have been written in about 200 pages, not this 500 + behemoth. It appears that Mr. Finder was just going through the motions to satisfy his booking agent. The story was so cookie cutter written. It was like some one gave him a formula to follow. The twists and ""surprise"" ending was so predictable that you had it figured out 50 pages before it happened. Luckily, I had other books with me on the trip to remind me of the magic of reading. Let's hope that Mr. Finder spends a little more time on his next book or he will soon be on his way to the bargain bin."
3,Good but could be leaner..3.5 stars,I like Joseph Finder.However; I think there are certain parts that don't advance the plot ex Audrey's situation with Leon and some of the goings on at Stratton. This book could lose about 30 pages or so and be lean on prose like David Ellis or Harlon Corban(?) Finder is a successful writer but so is Grisham & Patterson and not all their stuff turns out good.
3,New Finder As Good As Old Finder?,"This book, while interesting in that it takes a traditional mystery/thriller and places it in the corporate world did not impress me the way that Paranoia did.I think that the book is certainly a worthwhile read, but on the whole, I found the characters less interesting and less developed. Conover is the only character that I feel I know very well by the end of the story. The narrative and plot is imaginative and the storytelling is well-done, but I felt like the earlier novel was stronger.Receives a 3 from this ex-CEO."
4,"Unlikely story, but still a great read","If you were to break down the likelihood of all the events that take place in this novel, you'd probably realize the chances of everything happening in this way are just about null. However, I don't read Finder's novels because of their realism - he's a great escapist writer, and this novel is no exception.I won't rehash the story, but suffice to say that it's tightly told, with little space wasted despite the fact that this one is somehwhat lengthy. Nick Stratton is a sympathetic and believable protagonist, and most of the characters are fleshed out well by Finder. His writing is, as usual, crisp, and he doesn't waste time on events unimportant to the story.For anyone looking for a quick, exciting read that goes beyond a typical thriller, this one is a good choice. It's not his best effort, but this is definitely another winner from Finder."
1,"Creative plot, abominable characters, dark and depressing","The ""hero"" to use the author's term is a sleazy, morally empty, professionally incompetent narcissist beginning to end. He is placed in and kept in his CEO position because he was incompetent; wouldn't be a threat to either his old boss' reputation or the new owners. Of course, as a narcissist, he's completely unaware. The characters and settings are shallow and trite, including the business environment. The supporting character, a black female police officer is justification for out of place and shallow religious commentary. By the end, the hero is responsible for three unnecessary deaths and hasn't learned anything new, including anything about his children. Dark and depressing. Tough to finish; wouldn't have if I'd had something else with me. The author can write, but my guess is the mid-western business world isn't something he's familiar with so this was an awkward stretch."
2,"The one word to describe this ""Disappointed""","I am a big fan, and it was the last of Joseph Finder's books I have not read.This story was far too wordy, little action, detached characters and boring. I didn't even finish it and have moved on.I look forward to his next book and consider this book just a bump in the road."
2,Would YOU have an affair with your victim's daughter?,"After Nick kills a man, he begins to have an affair with the man's daughter.Really, I mean, ""movie logic"" I can buy since it's over in 2 hours. But with a book, you can be in the mind of the character and in this case, Nick falls too easily ""in love"" with the victim's daughter.But the plot moves along nicely and I did finish the book -- but I didn't believe a minute of it."
1,Completely agree with other 1 star reviews,"I very much liked the other two Finder books I had read, Paranoia and Killer Instinct, before deciding to try this one, however, Company Man is so bad I couldn't even finish it which is something I very rarely do. The main character does his best to avoid rational decision-making and isn't really all that sympathetic and after a while I could not care less what happened to him."
4,Well researched nice story albiet very long.,"The reader must be very patient to wade through the setup of this well researched story. Excitement is pretty much non- existant. However, if you read for the enjoyment of reading, this is well researched and flows quite well. The author even leaves a nice end which allows the reader to provide the future after the ending."
4,Not the usual who-dun-it,"As in most mysteries, the killing occurs early in the book. What is unusual is that we instantly know who the killer is. The rest of the book traces his actions and reactions to his own guilt and to the attempt to solve the killing. Parallel to this is a contemporary US business crisis that engulfs him as well. It's not a great book, but it held my attention until both mysteries were resolved."
4,Is it my imagination or...,"...was stuff simply more colorful back in the '60s? Most everything that's filmed now seems so bland.Anyway, this was a good TV special. Other than Petula herself the best part was Harry Belafonte's performance of ""Hambone"" (who is that kid with him anyway?). The worst part was the choreography of the dancers in the opening number."
3,Petula Clark Show from '60's,"It was OK, not to bad. It did kind of drag a little, I enjoyed some of her songs and just reminiscing back to the 60's."
5,Core Collection in Nursing,"This item was selected for ""Core Collection in Nursing and the Allied Sciences"" from Oryx Press, 1990."
1,Does not hold up.,"When I got my Fagor pressure cooker I was very pleased with how it worked and assumed my pressure cooking days were just beginning. I used it daily for about six months with no trouble other than cleaning. Then, without overheating or other accident, it developed a crack in the safety valve under the lid. It is made of some sort of weak pot metal. This is the valve which seals in the steam and raises the safety button. Unfortunately it cannot be purchased alone. You must buy the handle and other parts as a kit--all of which costs nearly as much as a new pressure cooker. I had expected nothing would need replacement but the gasket.Between the weakness of the part and the lack of economical access to a replacement, I would say Fagor is selling a throw-away product, unfortunately, because it really does work well--at first."
3,product not efficient,"it supposed to be a pressure cooker, but it took over an hour to cook some bean i am not satisfied at all"
4,great simple thermometer,"I am on my second Polder BBQ Safe Serve thermometer. I specifically sought out this thermometer when my old one had served its time because of its simplicity, reliability, and battery usage. It takes regular AA batteries, not button or other hard to find batteries. I have always had good results with an accurate reading. I like that it is one prong, not two - less invasion into the meat and easier to find a ""sweet"" reading spot. (I always insert into the thickest area on the most recently cooked side of the meat.) No, it's not instant read, but it's only $13!"
4,Nice product,"It works good so Far a few things I'm not sure I like is the buttons are small and I have skinny fingers there little hard to turn off,and you have to remember to press the side button to release the probe it's kinda hidden.and if you don't turn it off it will keep beeping about your temp."
2,Review comments,"My son, who was doing the work applying, said that the ""Red Devil"" brand worked better. I didn't understand why, but that is what he said."
4,"Long life, great performence, and highly accurate.",The station is now 4 years old. Purchased back in 06 during a Sevier summer drought. Being one that spends allot of time outside. I wanted something that would give me a general look out of the weather. The uv sensor doesn't drain batteries. On the other hand the thermo/hygro needs a battery change every month so it varies but everything works I highly recommend it after having great luck this isn't the last Oregon scientific item I use this along with a wmr100 professional weather station. And a bar208hga. The forecast is accurate if you set the altitude. Which you can find out from places like Wunderground.
5,In My All My Dreams...,"One of Laurie Wisefield's favorite Ash record when he was with the band!!! SOOOO much v-a-r-i-e-t-y on this one!!! The bass/guitar interplay in 'Lorelei' is near priceless. And those suspended ninths in 'Lonely Island' are beautifully played. Interestingly this record was recorded in BASSIST MARTIN TURNER's home basement studio, but goes to show that with very little, one CAN DO very much with!!! This is a TIMELESS CLASSIC!!! Amazing they were touring with AEROSHIP to promote this record back when it was originally released-too bad! Laurie Wisefeld IS DEF. one of the most underrated guitarists ever! (BTW, I always said Meta-lack-a's KIRK HAMMETT stole Laurie's looks and playing ability.) Laurie had great success w/TINA TURNER after leaving the Bone on Dec 30, 1985. He's currently working with some local English bands and has appeared on a musical program in England similar to Top of the Pops."
5,I love Dover clip art books,"More or less copyright free, and Dover seems to want you to use it for whatever makes sense to you. And the books are relatively inexpensive, on good paper. And they've been on sale here recently (early fall 2008)That said, I'm not sure there's a whole lot in the way of images I can use for quilting designs here.Which is OK too, because they are a lot of fun to browse."
4,Good value and item arrived quickly!,"I purchased this item for my Sony CD Stereo, but it didn't fit. Luckily, it fit a small radio that we keep in our garage and I was able to use the cord from that radio for my stereo. I know it sounds kind of weird, but it worked out perfectly for me..."
1,A waste of money,I got this for use with a small CD Player. I was very disappointed to find that it doesn't fit the player. I wouldn't bother with it again.
5,Fit Perfectly,"I used this cord as a replacement for a Panasonic BluRay. Many of the reviews I read said that what they received did not have one flat edge. The cord that I received had the flat edge and fit perfectly. As others stated, the cord is not 6 feet, but it does seem longer than a normal length cord. I haven't had the device on for hours at a time, but I can attest to the fact that it works for short periods of time...so far, so good!"
3,Stereo Plug,This plug was a perfect fit for an old stereo. I looked everywhere and was very pleased to find this cable. It fit and the stereo has a new life.
1,Reversed polarity,The cord I received had the polarity reversed; the neutral wire was hot and vice versa. I sent it back and promptly received another one just like it! This can be dangerous if connected to an appliance that requires polarity. The wide blade and the square end should both be neutral.
3,C2G Cables,"Product received in a timely manner and as advertised on AMAZON.COM. The power cable insulation and the attached connectors are not as thick or as well built as the original cable I received from Sony. It is, however, functional. There was no UL tag on either of the two cables I ordered and received, which makes me cautious about its use and safety. If the cables do meet UL requirements, I would expect to see a UL tag attached to the power cord stating so. My recommendation is to be careful not to overload this cord with the electronic device you attach to it. The original cord may have had a greater amperage capacity than this replacement cord."
3,Not what it shows,"The power cable works for what I need it for, but it was not the same as the one pictured. The one pictured has a flat edge on one side. I got one that was rounded on each side. It works...but the accuracy of the picture vs what actually arrives is off."
1,"NOT AS SHOWN, NO FLAT SIDE ON FEMALE END","THIS PART IS ALL WRONG, A POLARIZED PLUG IS CORRECT< BUT THE FEMALE END IS NOT POLARIZED, THIS CORD IS A BAStARD AND IS DANGEROUS, IT WILL NOT MAINTAIN A POLARIZATION BECAUSE THE FEMALE END CAN BE INSERTED EITHER WAY, TOTAL CHIC JUNK, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!"
1,Defrauded!,"This product is NOT as pictured, hence the one star rating. It is pictured as having one flat edge when in fact it has two rounded edges. It did not fit my application."
3,NOT 6 feet long,"I lost the cord to my DVR player and have anxiously awaiting this replacement for weeks. It arrived almost a week after the scheduled delivery date and then I opened the bag and the cord was less than 2 feet long. I had to go buy an extension cord to even get it to reach the hole in the back of my entertainment center. The seller was helpful and refunded purchase, so seller was appropriate. This could have been a mistake in what was just filled in my order. Not sure if everyone will receive a shorter cord or not. You may want to check with seller before purchase."
5,greay product!,Revieved this cord 2 days after ordering for my ps3. Exactly as described. Its a 120v 7a cord. Runs my ps3 perfectly fine and is snug in the outlet receptacle! I did have to shave a little off to fit in the ps3 as I'm sure this cord wasn't designed exaclty for it but its the same specifications as the ps3 cord!
1,Photo Is NOT Correct,Amazon really dropped the ball on this one. The image provided is not correct. The one pictured has a flat edge on one side. I got one that was rounded on each side. This product is now useless for what I need. What you see is not what you get.
3,Good start to an improving series,"Fortunately, the Paul Turner series gets better as does Zubro's crafting of enjoyable cop mystery stories. With this one, the debut of Paul Turner, Zubro tackles an interesting premise: are gay activist orgnizations behind the murder of an anti-gay televangelist's daughter? It's a question Paul Turner, a gay Chicago homicide detective, doesn't like having to look at, but one he realizes he must if he is to solve this case. The reader gets taken in a lot of different directions and one has to wonder if the poor cop will ever solve this case. Maybe Zubro hadn't made up his mind ""who done it"" until the final chapter because there are no really good clues, but plenty of motive to go around. All in all it was an enjoyable read, but it's not among my top 25 murder mysteries, regardless of genre (gay or straight or whatever)or author."
1,nothing sensual about this,"this was ""suggested"" to me when I purchased about 5 Dancing Fantasy cd's which are most definately sensual, erotic music to make love to. This is just sounds and is not erotic at all."
3,Erotica,It was just music. I expected more from the CD. But I was disappointed and tossed them in the trash.
5,Everything in one place,This is a great book. Not only do you have the value of the ornament but the price code is there too. The first set of numbers in the code tell you what you paid for the ornament so you can keep track of the values very easily. This is a wonderful book to own if you are a Hallmark collector. The layout of the book is easy to understand. You won't be disappointed if you purchase this book.
4,Hallmark Keepsake Ornament Value guide: Tracker Ed. 1973-2005,Great value guide. I only wish it included all of the Barbie ornaments. I have quite a few ornaments that were not in the book. I would have given it 5 stars had it included all the ornaments. It was a great investment nontheless.
5,Beautiful,"You cannot take your eyes off this production. Not only is the narrative exceedingly well done, but the cinematography is breathtaking. When my family sits down to watch this documentary barely a word is spoken."
3,Catholicism a must,Content was clear and understandable. Disc 2 was unreadable. This is a must see for all catholics or those who are interested in becoming Catholic.
3,"Ultimately, ""Soft-Sell"" Catholicism","While at times informative and helpful, this collection is symptomatic of the plight of Roman Catholicism in the U.S., as well as the West in general: it lacks the prophetic, authoritative voice of apostolic teaching on morality, so needed today.The episode on the Blessed Virgin does not mention the Rosary, nor the Marian saints, like, for example, St. Dominic, St. Juan Diego, St. Louis de Montfort or St. Maximilian Kolbe. Fr. Barron relegates Marian devotion to sentimentality and proceeds with a ""Protestant-friendly"" take on this topic and others.To a Church so removed from orthodoxy and bereft of sound catechesis over the past 50 years, Fr. Barron's series--at first glance--looks like a towering achievement. But it just goes to show how authoritative teaching has fallen into disrepair since Vatican II, and how its insipid replacement has come to the fore and assumed normative, pervasive status."
1,Damaged product,"We bought this ""used"" and the CD containing the 3rd episode was ""frozen"" and would not play. Being a used item, we did not know who to contact to gte a replacement or refund."
1,Horrible! They did not deliver the product. I am still waiting!,The DVD set was sched to arrive by the end of January. It did not. I sent them an email requesting an update of the status. They responded fairly quickly apologizing and said they would send another out to arrive yesterday. It did not. Very frustrating!
5,Instructional,"Commentator engaging, knowledgeable, vibrant. Material is relevant. Videography outstanding. So happy this was purchased and is being used for our Lenten Program at church."
5,A Brilliant Presentation.,"As a cradle Catholic this presentation brings all strands of my understanding of the Catholic Faith together, enhances and embellishes it. It, in my humble estimation, is historically and dogma sound, encompassing 2,000 plus years of faith. It is highly recommended for all Catholic groups and all families. Information such as can be achieved from this set cannot have a $$$ value."
4,Very Good Set,Very interesting and informative series about the Catholic Church and many places of significance in the world. Fr. Barron takes you around to different places and ties that place in with the subject he is speaking about. He is a very good speaker and very easy to understand. The only reason I am giving it four stars has nothing to do with the series itself... I bought the set slightly used and the disk which holds episodes 3 and 4 will not play in any device. I am disappointed at not being able to watch those two episodes but still feel glad that I bought the series and can watch the rest of it This would be a great set for any parish or home to own.
5,Excellent overview of Catholicism for lay people,"Fr. Barron has an incredible background in Catholicism and is a gifted catechist, in that he uses his vast knowledge to present the subject matter in an understandable and passionate way."
2,"Catholicism DVD Box Set - on what i bought, the Episode 9 hangs and the media copy quality is not quite excellent!","The 1st parts of the Episode 9 hangs, so i cannot view the whole Episode, but only 2/3 via selecting a scene. The quality of the CD is not good, i can see bubbles in the disc, which i suspect the root cause of the problem. In addition, the media copy quality doesn't seem to be an excellent one.Those who have been selling the copies of these excellent series should make sure that they have the best quality media copy burn in a high quality disc. Because it's just like drinking a contaminated excellent wine, using a plastic cup.But nevertheless, the series is excellent!"
2,Deffective Disk,"""Catholicism DVD Box Set"" The set included 5 disks with two videos per disk. The 5th disk was deffective with visible voids beneath the surface on outside edge of disk. This caused the first part of the ninth video to stall at the beginning. If you fast forward to skip over the defect you lose the first several minutes of the 9th video. I want a replacement for this disk to fulfill the terms of my original purchase."
3,Catholicism DVD Box set,"The content of these DVDs is absolutely first class. It is clear, and so very interesting. Robert Barron and his team have done the most superb job.Unfortunately the quality of the recordings is poor. In the set I received, Episode 9 is almost unplayable and episode 10 is not much better. To have such poor recordings for such excellent content is SO disappointing - especially as the set is not cheap!To sum up: Content - stupendous! Recording - poor!Since writing this originally, Amazon have replaced the set of DVDs (no quibble,thanks!) and the new DVDs are all of excellent quality"
5,Catholicism DVD set,The item arrived just as described.Father Baron is very charismatic and explains concepts and ideas very clearly and convincingly.
5,Very informative and breathtaking pics of churches.,If you are a new Catholic or a cradle Catholic there is something for everyone to see and learn from these videos we enjoy watching over and over.
5,Catholicism DVD Box Set,"Finished all five DVDs in one weekend! Thank you, Amazon.com, for getting my advance order to me in record time!"
2,Not worth it,I bought this book because I was thinking about getting married in Ireland. I found more information on the internet than I found in the book and the internet is free. The book is well written and the information is helpful but trust me you can get the same information and more on the internet at no cost to you. I did.
5,Excellent advice; good value,"This book is just what it says it is -- advice for planning your wedding from long-distance. Full of practical tips including questions to ask vendors, strategies if you can only make one visit to the site, etc. Good value!"
2,disappointed,I fell in love with the picture. The ring showed to be sligthly brushed looking. When the ring arrived I was quick to learn the picture looks nothing like the ring. The ring is a bright polish and the yellow gold is barely visiable. I'm very disappointed with amazon for the lack of description.
4,"Nice, but very small","Very nice suitcase, but really a lot smaller than I expected. It would be more of a ""show"" piece, than usable item"
4,Grandson loves it!,I purchased this item for my grandson's birthday. He really seemed to enjoy it. I can'w wait until he brings it when he visits. It seems to be the perfect size to hold his treasures!
5,Just what I expected...,"I ordered this suitcase for a baby gift and it was just what I expected it to be. Some reviews stated that it was small, but I found it to be just the right size. It is not a full size suitcase. I had the blanket monogrammed with the baby's name on it and the new parents were thrilled with the gift. I would recommend this suitcase for a small child or new baby."
2,Dissapointed,"I received this suitcase for my grandaughter. I too should have read the dimensions, as it is very small and made of cardboard. Very cheaply made for the price. I would not recommend this product."
4,nice child case,"The item was fine and well made, I just thought it would be a little bigger. But other than that it was well worth it."
5,Strongly recommended,"I strongly recommend this book as a main grammar book in the learning of Chinese. This is a watered-down beginner-lower intermediate version of the superlative ""Chinese: A Comprehensive Grammar"" and covers the basics. It's just a pity that it is rather an expensive purchase.The authors were lecturers at the University of Leeds in the UK but have since retired."
4,Porter-Cable,this tool has been used quite often now and it works very well for the use or abuse it takes the tool is being used by students or as we say stud-ences no we dont use the line free when teaching we teach them to use the tool that came first and then we make it a little easy for them no sence starting with what they cant afford and for the difference in price why would theythe porter cable has stood the test of time with no complaints as anyone would tell you the toughest thing to do to a tool is let it be used by various people but AS WAS STATED IT STILL WORKS WELLWITH NO COMPLAINTS
5,Old school sleazy action,I found these four volumes very entertaining. The variety of matches ranged from sexy to long one-sided beatdowns. Whoever's booking these events is doing a great job. I'm happy with this purchase and will probably continue to buy WEW DVDs.
5,I bought this and expect to use it but do not yet know how!,"I have no problem with the old ones or the new pcb ones found in Squiers and such, but I am not yet confident in my ability to use this. I did notice one of the connection pins was bent. I bent it back and don't think it'll be a problem. I do plan to use it in a future build or rebuild, but as of now do not know how to use it, as it has so many configurations and comes with no documentation. If someone knows please let me know how to use it as google was of little help. I will still give it 5 stars as it doesn't need to suffer for my ignorance."
5,Great book,"Can't praise it enough. Barely science fiction, mostly a journalist/spy/love/culture story. Cynical and hopeful, very well written, lots of local color.Dense reality, good overview and philosophy. A thinking person's book.Lew"
4,Great Read!!,"Couldn't put it down with the first read. A great story. Believable characters. Recently re-read and loved it just as much the second time. There will most likely be a third and fourth. A great story is worth rereading over and over again. Thank you, N. Lee Wood."
4,This novel twists the usual story into a much better one.,"Whoa, this was not what I expected. I picked up the book because it looked palatable. What surprised me was the welcome deviation from the usual romantic couple. Unusual characters, unusual romance. Also, I did like the story line and loved the physical movement from place to place."
2,Poor,Comes off more like made for TV movie of the week. It was very disjointed and hard to follow. I strongly recommend National Geographic: Inside the Green Berets instead of this title.
2,Would not recommend,Too basic no real insight into what they do and how they do it. No interesting interviews with former SF-operatives. Well a bit of a disappointment. I gave the DVD to a friend.
3,A Musical Trip Down Memory Lane,This is a wonderful set of old time music. Brings back memories of MOM. However it would have been nice if the artists who performed these songs were included.
1,Not helpful for the experienced,"I have three years experience in graphic and motion design for the web. This book offered very very simplistic and, sometimes, downright ugly examples of layouts. They all looked like the hideous templates from any desktop publishing program - good for neighborhood flyers and family websites but useless to professionals. The book sometimes even re-used layouts for different sections. If you find yourself more inspired by very vivid complex design examples, not by overly simplistic ones, then this book is not for you. Also please be aware that the book is small, 6 inches high by 4.5 inches wide, with a plastic cover, reminiscent of a pocket trail map."
3,"Good, but kind of dated","This book can give some ideas on layouts, but the designs on it are very dated. So if you want to take anything good from the book you have to focus more on estructure, and how information is organized on the layout, rather then on the overall design. It's a good book for starters but I preferGraphic Design Cookbook: Mix & Match Recipes for Faster, Better Layouts. The ideas there are simple, but because of that, never dated."
3,Mediocre,This book is inexpensive because it's not really much use to anyone that has any experience. The sample layouts are not very attractive and thereby not too useful.
3,This is a very small book,"I dind't noticed how small this book when I bought it, and I thought I should warn you about it. It's a size of a pocket book. Of course this doesn't mean it has no information however it doesn't brings you alot of insights. I would reconsider before buying it."
2,I wasn't inspired...,"This book seems like a good idea when you first open it. Oh wow! A ton of layouts that I can adjust to my own project! I bought the book second hand a bookstore and when I actually opened it to work with a client, I found that this book was really not helpful at all.All the layouts only work with the graphics given. They also don't really work with standard sizes on most of them. There's no guidance on how to present the information or how the user will percieve the information. There are little snippits here and there called ""Focus On..."" where they tell you a little about a specific layout, but they didn't really seem all that helpful.I was really disappointed with this book. I wonder if the other books in this series are any good..."
1,not very good examples,This book cam with the color index and idea index when I purchesed it. The others were better than this one. The examples are pretty hideous and didn't offer the kind of inspiration I wanted. I rated the color book much better.
4,Exactly What I Needed,"First things first: this book was clearly designed for beginners. It would probably not be particularly helpful to someone with a graphic design background.But as someone who has no professional design experience at all and is faced with creating and producing a newsletter for the first time and possibly a brochure as well, this book has been a tremendous help. It answered all my most basic questions, as well as ones I was too ignorant to know I should have (grid? what's that?) The book helpfully assumes that I know more or less nothing, and quickly and economically escorts me through a series of possibilities. I didn't like all the design ideas or layouts, but I wouldn't expect to. Many of the layouts were quite nice, though, and one of them has already been selected to serve as a jumping-off point for me. This won't be the last book I consult, but I'm grateful it was the first."
3,A little out dated,"This whole series seems a little dated to me. The books still serve as a good reference point for ideas, but is really just a book of examples from projects."
2,Definitely a sequel.,"While Idea Index provides actual ides for nice graphical renderings, the layout index is very simple and very scarce when it comes to layout ideas. It has a limited number of sample ideas which only look good due to the images present in the layout. The layouts provided don't really add much to the presentation of the information in the examples. Also, the web layouts are especially horrendous - despite looking semi-pretty, they do not consider at all the medium (e.g. giant images take longer to load, etc.). I was pretty disappointed by this book after liking Idea Index so much.Overall, the book is so-so. Going through it at a library will give you all the layout ideas this book could ever provide - there's no need to keep it on your shelf for future reference. If you're looking for good, or at least original print layout ideas, you better look elsewhere."
2,What a disappointment!,"I love Idea Index. You can flip to any random page and get some creative solutions that hadn't occurred to you. Layout Index, however, is not nearly as useful, innovative or even interesting, unless vintage 1994 design is your idea of ""cutting edge"". I think the author had these ideas sitting in his desk drawer a little too long.Unlike Idea Index, which is a hodgepodge of design ideas that are far from finished, Layout Index walks the reader through some solutions. Instead of ideas, you get second-rate finished pieces that won't spark your own ideas. The beauty of the nonlinear index is lost.I guess this book might be useful for those who need help with their church newsletter or flyers for the kids' birthday party. Will professionals get any use out of this? Nope. I'll give it two stars just because it might come in handy for the soccer moms.I hate to dog the book... his first one was so good, but I guess that's why this one is such a dud. My expectations were not met."
4,Cute but Powerful Little Reference Guide,"I mainly do websites for small businesses, but if they like my work, they often ask me to re-do their business cards or create a newsletter template to match their website. Of course, I lie and tell them I know how to do these things. This book has made an honest person out of me. It provides inspiration for these different media formats. If I'm stuck when trying to create a new web identity from scratch, these pages have provided that spark of inspiration. Worth the money and it doesn't take up much room on your desk."
4,I recommend it,"I recommend having this whole series. They are nice little books to flip through when you are ready to start a new project. I agree that the design elements appear a little stale and dated, but when I look past the actual examples they use and envision my own layouts, they still give me ideas to expand upon.A good deal for the money."
3,Not overly sophisticated,"I bought this along with the Color Index, and I must admit I'm not overly impressed with the ideas in this text.I will keep it onboard because you -never- know what might spark your creativity, and I must admit there are a few good ideas to jump off from in this book. I donno, I guess I just feel underminded when I flip through this book. It is a bit too kitchy for me (think clip-art-like graphics), and many of the solutions presented in it are too busy and hardly professional."
2,"Good Series, Weakest of the Set","This is part of a three book set, which is a great addition to any design library. Unfortunately, this is the weakest of the set - there are a few tidbits, but nothing much. If you buy the other two (Color Index & Idea Index) you will be set. This one I don't recommend to often."
5,Another Great Cookbook,This book is another great book in their series. I own both of them & used it everyday at work to save me time brainstorming. Cant wait for another one in the series. Great Jobs!
2,Sad leftovers from the dark ages...,"This book is at first appearance, visually interesting and consuming. But upon closer look (as in opening it) it's not worth the time, money or breath sadly. The concepts and ideas within this book can be inspiring to thoses who have the time and energy, but overall this book is just a display of bad, kitsch design. My advice? Don't bother."
1,Horrendous!,"I have been slowly building my Design Library, and this book made me laugh right out loud! Just by looking at the sample page excerpts offered, one can tell that this book is a total waste of money to anyone with a fine arts-based design degree. But, if you do not have any idea about design, and enjoy cookie-cutter, bland, out-dated design, or if you don't need much to inspire you, then this book would probably be just fine for your library."
3,Supercool Halloween Costume,"Costume is well made, and comes complete with pompoms which saves you money. Sizes are accurate and the materials/stitching are great quality. Very happy with my purchase."
4,Great Band,"After seeing these guys in march at a very small club (50 people) in Schenectady, N.Y. this past march, I had to get a couple more of their albums. Been listening to them for about 5 years now and don't know how I missed them in the 70's. Fantastic twin guitar work. Would deffinitly go see them again. Good album, and bought ""Illumination"" at the show, another good album."
5,Sad that it ends,"The fight scenes in this last installment of Chaikin's Heart of India series are as usual in Chaikin's writing quite good really. She keeps the whole thing masculine, as it should be, instead of playing things down completely for the women readers. Coral and Jace continue their love story in much the same way as in the first two books, and everything is righted in Coral's world at the end. All in all, this was a good read that the avid Chaikin reader will enjoy."
5,Heart of India Series,I enjoyed this series by Linda Chaikin---They are the first books I've read written by her. She writes well keeping the reader entranced by her story plot. I look forward to reading more of her books.
4,An amazing book,"This book was really good! It held the mystery of the rest of the Heart of India Series which areSilk (Heart of India)andunder Eastern Stars (Heart of India, #2). Those books were all so good, besides the fact that you have to wait to get the next one at the library they were pretty good books. They were really interesting and the mystery was always so compelling. It drew you in so well and made you feel like you were along for the ride with Jace and Coral in the adventure of figuring out what happened to Gem, Coral's adopted son who has been mysteriously murdered but Coral has reasons to beleive he is still alive somewhere."
2,Cultural insensitivity,"At it's finest. Of course, after reading the author info blurb and discovering that she is part of a ""church-planting"" group working in Kerala, I should have realised that the author would have a skewed view of any non-evangelical Christian religion.As an earlier reviewer noted, the author mis-uses Hindi honorifics, and none of the Hindu/Indian characters are particularly admirable in their behavior. The only ""good"" Indians in the series seemed to be ""Gem"" the adopted child of Coral and ""Jemani"", Gem's mother, who had converted too Christianity.Historical inaccuracies abound as well...the metric system wasn't adopted in France until 1795, and wasn't made compulsory in France until the 1840s. So the use of the metric units of measure by the male lead was incorrect, as the British used the Imperial standard of measure until well into the 19th and 20th century.I had a hard time reading this book, as the opinions and the inaccuracies of the author kept pulling me out of the story."
3,Don't fit on the wooden Thomas tracks,"I didn't realize these are a different type of Thomas Train. Apparently, the ""take along"" trains are smaller, with a narrower wheel base than the traditional wooden Thomas set, and won't fit into the grooves on the wooden Thomas Tracks. They have their own ""take along Thomas"" tracks. So, I was disappointed when we got them, since we already have a ton of wooden track, and I'm trying to avoid having three different sets of trains and tracks. But if it is the take-along Thomas set you are looking for, then go for it. These two are very economical and durable."
3,Progressive Lead,"The book is excellent in the fact it goes into great detail in music theory, scales, patterns, and so forth, but the problem comes with the included CD. The CD lessons do not correspond with the lessons in the book. Mostly the error comes from mistitling the first 6 lessons on the cd which puts the whole thing off. The only way I saw to correct it, is to download the cd into a program like iTunes and spend an hour renaming all the lesson titles, then either playing back on your iPod or burning it onto a new CD."
2,"looks great, feels like a toy",this watch looks nice and tells time just fine but it feels very light and cheap. It looks like a nice watch but feels like a toy. I was hoping this would be an everyday watch but instead I will only wear it to lodge meetings or other similar functions I am worried it will not hold up to the rigor of daily use.
4,"Great Value, Scratches Easily","I bought this ring as a wedding band for my husband since he wears a silver watch and a gold necklace, so the two-tone style was perfect. It is super comfortable and looks great, but be warned that it does scratch easily. We've been married for 7 months and it's definitely taken a beating. We're hoping that we can get some of the scratches buffed out, but my husband doesn't really care either way!"
1,Book is a Hoax,It is a shame that someone would sacrifice a tree to write this book. Not only was the scholarship seriously lacking. The author ignored all evidence that did not fit into his conspiracy theory. It's no surprise that this book is out of print.Sorry I had to give it one star. There is no category on this form for zero.
1,This book is full of it!,"If it were allowed, I wouldn't even give this guy one star! This DITLIEB guy is probably some Ex-Nazi or Nazi-Wanna-Be trying to convince the world that Jews are liars as well as this poor young girl! Don't read it!"
4,Good Book,This book was required text for an online class. Good information and easy to read. Good introduction to Catholicism or review of the how and whys.
4,4 out of 5,"Norwegian group combines the intensity of metal, the majesty of melodic rock, and the story telling of progressive rock into one mind-blowing experience."
4,special event book,this Basketball's Best Shots Book geve you the opportunity to remember the special event wite beautiful storys & nice pictures.nice & elegant book
3,basketball shots,some greats photos in here but the captioning had a lot to be desired--sometimes you have a caption in a place that doesnt match where the photo is--the editor should have looked at this a bit better. this book could have been compiled much better
5,Yes it's true...they are that good!,"This is one of those groups that someone puts in the car stereo or at home and suddenly your ears tell you there is something great in the air...and it is simply great optimistic prog rock! ...or adventureous music...or avant-garde rock ...or whatever you want to call it! You will like this if you like bands like the Mothers, Soft machine, Faust, the Muffins, etc...i also liked ""Iskander"" with collaborations from Charlie Mariano and Pierre Moerlen!!"
3,survivor knife review,"i found the knife ,sling shot ,and harpoon to be good but, the survivor gear is a joke. if in a true survival situation you might make it.if your planing to go on a survival weakend pack better gear to make things easyer."
5,A Wonderful Resource for Exam Preparation,Jon Politis' Paramedic Review Manual provides an excellent review for practicing paramedics and for paramedic students who may be preparing for state or national registry exams. The book is well worth it.
1,Disappointed,Product came in beat-up box with parts missing and body of bike chipped with very badly done paint touch-up. Parts were cheaply made often thin plastic and even after it was put together it was wobbly and cheap in its appearance. It looked and felt like a used item. I will never again buy a tricycle online. The company also did not respond to my email requesting information on where the parts had been painted and if I should be concerned about lead paint.
3,Ok for the price,The seat and basket are lightweight plastic but for a small kid will probably work just fine. Went together well and all pieces were included.
2,Unfortunate,Got this book in prep for a trip to Australia and they don't actually talk like that and therefore this was a waste of money.
2,Very Boring Book!,What people say in this book is very boring. Elizabeth is angry or crying on every page! You never get the sense that you are the person telling the story and the things are happening to you. Don't buy this if you want a deep romance story. Get it out of a local library and see what I mean.
5,Liberty and Justice for All!,"I suppose I am biased. My life totally changed 5 short months ago when I became a Pre-Paid Legal Associate. I had the service and only mentioned it casually to friends, when I discovered the need in the marketplace. Pre-Paid Legal is a much needed service and it is going to change the face of justice in this country. It is amazing how much money the Pre-Paid Legal Associates are making simply by telling others about this much needed service.This book details the life and vision of Harold Stonecipher. I had the opportunity to hear him speak and he is powerful. A God-fearing man. A visionary. He helped me remember that Justice is not a commodity, its a right! Read this book. Know the story. Change your life."
4,Very satisfied,"I bought this caliper over a year ago and, after a lot of use, am still very happy with it. The only time I've had a problem is using it in cold areas - say under 50 degrees, when it didn't seem to be as accurate. But definitely a good value for the price."
4,A great tool at a great price,"I only received the calipers a couple days ago but already they have proven to be a great investment.The entire unit feels sturdy and well made. I can't tell if it's steel or another hardened metal but it does not feel like aluminum. The display is very easy to read w/ large numbers. My only complaint is the display is constantly flashing the numbers while it's active/powered, which is slightly annoying at first. Otherwise, all of the button options (scale/zero) work wellThe plastic case is great for protection when not in use. The only issue was I had to trim out a slight corner of foam to get the calipers to fit properly.I am certainly glad I went with the 12"" versus the 6"" Avenger. You never know when the extra capacity will help.Overall - GREAT DEAL!"
2,Good for Beginners--Need more information for intermediate/advanced,"I thought this book had basic fitness information, I have been following Monica Brant and was excited to see she finally had a book on the market, but was a bit dissappointed with the information it provided. It was not detailed enough in regards to workout routines, it needed more specifics & more excercises for body parts but would provide enough for beginners. It's also much shorter than expected."
2,Monica brants book,I was disappointed with this book. I am a personal trainer and thought I would pick up new information from such a big star in the fitness industry. This book is only for beginners to exercise.
4,Nicely written,"Monica Brant has been an inspiration to me for quite some time. Although this is information that I already knew, it is always nice to read what she is doing for her own routine. A great resource for beginners and an inspiration for everyone."
5,Great information,Knowing what Monica Brant's professional accomplishments were I was pleased with her added insight into her personal notes. Really great info for the person who wants to compete in fitness shows or just get in great shape.
1,BIGFOOT,"MY SON RECEIVED THIS FOR CHRISTMAS AND IT IS NOT AS ADVERTISED. IT IS SO GUTTLESS ON POWER THAT IT WON'T GO ACROSS OUR SHORT CARPET, LET ALONE CLIMB OVER THINGS LIKE IN THE AD. WE TRIED SOME IN THE STORE AND THEY APPEAR TO BE THE SAME WAY. NEW BATTERIES MADE NO DIFFERENCE. THE 2-WHEELED ROAD RIPPERS APPEAR TO BE OK, BUT THIS TRUCK HAS NO POWER. TALK ABOUT A DISAPPOINTED KID!!"
3,not so durable,really lots of fun while it works...great for my 4 year old untill he gave it all it could take after about 3 weeks....the toy is obviously made for younger kids...should be more durable
1,Cheap,I paid $40 for a toy that arrived with a $12.99 price tag intact. It wasnt worth $12.99. I purchased this for a charity secret santa. The young boy asked for a monster truck. I hope he is not disappointed but I am. You can buy a better toy at a pharmacy or convenience store.
2,The Wall Live,"This is a purely live, non-remastered, non-edited version of the concert. As such, the recording quality is quite poor. There are other versions available which have been edited / re-mastered. I had one of these years ago which was a superior recording. Unfortunately some lowlife broke into my car and stole it."
3,Very Good Digital Camera but defective,When I received My coolpix S6 I really liked the features and I could not wait to use it on my vacation. After a week the Coolpix S6 just stoped focusing. The LCD screen just turned black. Sent the camera 2 weeks ago still no response from Nikon. Good Camera but reliability is a problem. Would recommend extended warrenty.
3,"Some excitement, some surprises!","Bought this as a present for my wife... works fine as a basic camera with low res video recording as well.Love the following:1. Size of the display screen - Ahhmazing!2. handy - small enough to fit comfortably in pockets/ handbags3. Simple to use.Some surprises and disappointments were1. Never could get the Wi-fi to work2. Flash pictures taken at night have some white spots - I believe it could be due to the fact that the flash is too close to the lens.3. While taking videos, the powerful microphone also records the noise of the lens focussing, which can be annoying if shooting in a quiet place without too much ambient noise.4. Because there is no viewfinder, shooting in bright sunlight is a challenge - or an act of faith - you just have to trust that the camera will get what you want - but cant see in the bright light!Will not highly recommend.Enjoy!"
3,not bad but not awesome,"The best part of this camera is the wifi capability. The picture quality is decent as long as vivid color mode is there. The flash is a bit strong in my opinion so better pictures are found with the slow sync flash. If you're willing to tweak the settings, you'll get some great pictures, but don't expect great thing straight out of the box. Also if nikon can get a firmware fix for the bad blur, this would be a much better camera"
2,Does not perform as priced,"I paid a premium for wifi, which has never worked. The software required is buggy and poorly supported. When my Mac crashed while installing the software, the support person (who was not easily understandable) told me to reset my router. Support was a joke. The pictures quality has left me disappointed. I won't be buying another Nikon point and shoot."
3,Serious flaw with display screen,"Here's the problem. After a couple of years of use, the display screen went black. I can view my pictures, but I can't take pictures. Actually, I can take pictures, but they are black. A little research turned up a lot of complaints about the Black Screen Problem. Nikon won't fix it and it costs more to have it repaired than the camera is worth.What a disappointment. It was a nice camera, but I'd stay away from Nikon after this experience. Google ""Nikon Black Screen"" before you decide to buy."
3,Not The best Camera,"Love it when it works, had to send it in twice already for repair. Would not buy a small Nikon again, love my SLR though from Nikon. You get what you pay for."
4,avoid Nikon cameras -- no support if anything goes wrong,"About two years after I bought this camera (my original review appears below), the camera suddenly and out-of-the-blue stopped working. I had long ago mailed Nikon the registration/warranty card that came with the camera, so I sent in the camera for repair, confident that there would be no issues."
4,Watch bands,"I've wanted this watch ever since I first saw it in the film ""Men in Black"". It has become a little status symbol among Special Effects Makeup Artist.The watch is out of this world, the only problem is the tiny size band that comes with it. A Standard ladies size band is 6 1/2 inches!!!Maybe in 1920. As soon as my watch was delivered I rushed down to my neighborhood Watch repair shop and found an extra long band that would fit my 8 inch wrist. A $20 watch band never looked better, but that's just between you and me......Nenie"
3,Texas country,"Yes this is Texas country. Country with a little folk sound in the mix of the song. REK does a great job a writing the songs, well most of the time, he does manage to throw in a song on most of his cd's that just does not fit in. I like him and like his cd's and he did well with this one. I give it 3 stars maybe 4."
5,The joys of being a child revisited...,"I tell you what. Kudos to Amazon.com for finding books from a baby boomer's childhood! I have told people about this book for half my life -- and the ability to get it back on Amazon gets me off the hook for being a crackpot who makes these things up! LOL!I will have to read it again -- because I am sure that after all these years, my memory has cllouded the plot somewhat; but I have never been able to go into an antiques store without wondering if there was an object inside that would draw ME into another place, as well! A must read for your sophisticated pre-teen children!"
4,Classic Trucker Movie,"I actually bought this movie for my husband. But I got to watch it before he did. It's a very cool movie right up there with the likes of Convoy. Henry Fonda, Eileen Brennan n a very young Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger fame) make a great cast. If you like classic movies, as well as action this is worth a look."
2,Not really a trucker movie,"Overall, I liked the movie, it was different, and you won't see it on tv anymore. It is sometimes neat to see what poplular actors did before they became famous, in this case freddy kruger. It is part of my trucker movie collection, and I like films from the 70's, so it is a keeper. Not the best, but it was'nt bad, either."
3,Great Smokey Roadblock,"Smokey and the Bandit and the Great Roadblock, two great, must see, trucker films. I loved this film because of the cast...Henry Fonda, Susan Sarandon and Dub Taylor, excellant roles for all of them. This film had me laughing, and on the edge of my seat. Definitly a ride I enjoy. This is one VHS that I hang on to."
